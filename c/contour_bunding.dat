40|$|Technical and {{socio-economic}} assessment {{of soil and}} water conservation measures was carried out in Afdeyu for a period of five months (May - September, 1997). During this period, the total rainfall was 513 mm and the total erosivity for rainstorms greater than 12. 5 mm was 302 Jmm/m 2 hr. The technical part was concentrated in the research area with four experimental plots of 6 m by 30 m each. They were placed adjacent to each other on a slope of 18 %. The first plot was a control plot (without conservation measure) and the others were with measures such as <b>contour</b> <b>bunds,</b> Fanya Juu and double ditch. To assess the effectiveness of the different measures, data on runoff, soil loss, crop biomass and soil moisture was collected. The control plot showed distinctly the highest runoff (36 mm) and soil loss (48. 7 tonnes/ha). The lowest runoff and soil loss was found with double ditch (3. 26 mm, 0. 08 tonnes/ha) and Fanya Juu (3. 45 mm, 0. 13 tonnes/ha) respectively. The <b>contour</b> <b>bunds</b> were found to have a runoff 13. 22 mm and a soil loss of 2. 39 tonnes/ha. However, the <b>contour</b> <b>bunds</b> contributed to a higher biomass (1819 kg/ha) as compared to the other measures, and both <b>contour</b> <b>bunds</b> and Fanya Juu showed higher soil moisture than the double ditch. Even if a considerable difference existed between the plots with conservation measures and the control plot, statistically, no significant difference at a 5 % significance level was found. The socio-economic survey was done with a questionnaire. It was found that farmers preferred <b>contour</b> <b>bunds</b> because they take less cultivable area (14 %) than both Fanya Juu (17 %) and double ditch (24 %).

As {{a result}} of in-situ testing of rain water harvesting, for four seasons at on-station {{research}} level, chisel ploughing together with <b>contour</b> <b>bunding</b> technique have been chosen as appropriate means of water harvesting and conservation measures. The technique was tested on marginally cultivated, hard compacted soil of relatively low infiltration rates, locally known as "gardud" (sandy clay). This type of soil is of good farming potential if appropriate soil and water management techniques are undertaken. The aim of using this technique {{is to improve the}} ability of "gardud" soil to absorb and conserve water, to alleviate the effect of long dry spells by harvesting surface runoff to increase soil water storage for earlier and better plant establishment and hence to increase yield. The chisel and <b>contour</b> <b>bunding</b> every 10 metres were better than the control flat technique in improving soil physical properties and increasing soil water storage. The effect was reflected in highly significant sorghum plant establishment and growth. Both grain and dry matter yields were significantly increased by chisel and <b>contour</b> <b>bunding.</b> The technique increased grain yield by 152 % over the control. Also, contour and non-contour treatments produced 1277 kg/ha and 1016 kg/ha, respectively, for the mean of chisel and flat treatments with 25. 7 % increase. The economic analysis indicated a 204 % marginal rate of return for chisel polugh with contour over chisel alone. Even <b>contour</b> <b>bunding</b> with flat cultivation has doubled the economic return compared to the traditional flat alone. Therefore, this improved technology is economically superior to the traditional cultivation. Furthermore, it can be adopted to utilize- "gardud" soil as an alternative to, and to relief pressure from, exhausted and continuously cultivated poor "goz" sandy soil.

40|$|Abstract. A {{transition}} from slash-and-burn farming to sustainable land use {{is essential for}} the prevention of poverty and the conservation of the rainforest in the Philippine uplands. The key of this transition is that farmers invest in the quality of their land, e. g., through terracing, <b>contour</b> <b>bunding,</b> irrigation facilities, agroforestry or tree plantation. In their turn, these investments depend on a variety of factors, such as the households ’ socioeconomic and agro-ecological conditions. This chapter presents an econometric analysis of the determinants of households ’ investments in land quality in the Philippines. A logit model of investments is formulated using the information generated from an in-depth household survey of 104 households randomly selected in four upland villages located in Luzon, Philippines at varying distance to the major markets of metropolis Manila. The findings show that older household heads have a higher probability of investing in land quality improvement. This is due to ‘lifecycle effects ’ {{on the part of the}} farmers since they accumulate capital and knowledge as they grow older. Household heads with more knowledge of soil and water conservation techniques, and households with additional, non-farming income are also more likely to invest in land improvements. Significant influence is also observed of village-level characteristics. Contrary to (neo-) Boserupian theory, population density did not appear to have an influence...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was to}} quantify runoff, soil and nutrient losses from major agricultural land use practices and assess the efficiency of <b>contour</b> <b>bunds</b> in controlling the tide of those nutrient losses in two selected micro-catchments of the Lake Victoria Basin. The experiment was conducted on thirteen-instrumented runoff plots, measuring 15 m by 10 m, established on farmer’s fields on banana, coffee, annuals and degraded rangelands. Each of the four land-use practices was replicated three times, except banana, which was replicated four times. Two plots under banana were mulched and two were not. <b>Contour</b> <b>bunds</b> were hand-constructed two years after runoff plots establishment. Eroded sediments were collected, aggregated per season and analysed for selected nutrients. The average annual runoff ranged between 315. 47 and 2438. 92 m 3 ha- 1 yr- 1. Degraded rangelands lost relatively higher amounts of rainfall water through surface runoff compared to banana and coffee (p= 0. 022). The average annual soil loss ranged from 27. 7 to 86. 7 t ha- 1 yr- 1. It was higher on annuals compared to banana and coffee (p= 0. 038). Eroded sediments had relatively high nutrient concentrations than the remaining soils, and varied with land-use and /or seasons (p< 0. 05), and did not show a single pattern for all nutrients.

In this research CBA was used as a decision tool after the computation of all cost and benefits were valued in local currency to obtain the Net Present Value (NPV) or net welfare. The results show that investment in SWC measures may not be a feasible short-term option from farmers’ perspective. There is, therefore, a strong case for intervention, especially in the initial years where SWC adoption yields negative returns. Again the maintenance cost was higher for all SWC technologies.

Comparison of the frequency distributions of SL a rates on cropland without and with the application of SWCTs shows that the exceedance probability of tolerable SL a rates is ca. 20 % lower when SWCT are applied. However, no notable effect of SWCTs on the frequency distribution of RC a is observed. For 224 runoff plots (corresponding to 1567 plot-year data), SWCT effectiveness in reducing R a and/or SL a could be directly calculated by comparing measured R a and/or SL a with values measured on a reference plot with conventional management. Crop and vegetation management techniques (i. e. buffer strips, mulching and cover crops) and mechanical techniques (i. e. geotextiles, <b>contour</b> <b>bunds</b> and terraces) are generally more effective than soil management techniques (i. e. no-tillage, reduced tillage and contour tillage). Despite being generally less effective, no-tillage, reduced tillage and contour tillage have received substantially more attention in the literature than the other SWCTs. Soil and water conservation techniques are generally less effective in reducing R a than in reducing SL a, which is an important consideration in areas where water is a key resource and in regions susceptible to flooding. Furthermore, all SWCTs show a more consistent and effective reduction of both R a and SL a with increasing R a and SL a magnitude, which is attributed to the reduced influence of measurement uncertainties. Although some significantly negative correlations between SWCT effectiveness and plot slope length, slope gradient or annual precipitation were found, the importance of these factors in explaining the observed variability in effectiveness seems limited. Time-series analyses of R a during multiple years of SWCT application strongly indicate that no-tillage and conservation tillage become less effective in reducing R a over time. Such an effect is not observed for SL a. © 2012 Elsevier B. V. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|A soil {{conservation}} project was implemented in Tanzania for over 30 years. This study applied a socio-economic approach {{to examine and}} analyse the benefits of {{soil conservation}} in the Kondoa eroded area of Tanzania by conducting a household survey of 240 households. The study findings show that 89 % and 70 % of respondents consider soil conservation activities have increased vegetation and soil fertility, respectively. Decreased soil erosion was perceived by 68 % of respondents, increased firewood by 98 %, increased fodder by 50 %, high crop yields by 56 %, and food sufficiency by 68 %. These are the outcomes of conservation tillage, integrated farming and use of organic fertilizers, controlled stall feeding, agroforestry, construction of cut off drains, <b>contour</b> <b>bunds</b> and <b>contour</b> ridges cultivation, which are the main land use practices in the area. Access to extension services, household sizes, long term land ownership, crop incomes and awareness of soil conservation project were found to determine the level of participation in soil conservation. Major challenges are the lack of sustainability of those activities because of a recent policy decision to withdraw conservation investment. Despite the challenge, this study concluded that past government efforts on soil conservation activities initiated since the early 1970 s through decentralization, institutional collaboration, socioeconomic support to farmers and continuous local community participation in restoring the degraded ecosystem of Kondoa have contributed to ensure environmental and socio-economic sustainability in the area...|$|R
40|$|This study {{measures}} {{the impact of}} fanya juu bunds (an important {{soil and water conservation}} technology and the most popular type of <b>contour</b> <b>bund</b> in east Africa) on the value of crop production in a high-rainfall area in the Ethiopian highlands using cross-sectional multiple plot observations. We applied switching regression, stochastic dominance analysis (SDA), and decomposition and propensity score matching methods to ensure robustness. The switching regression, SDA, and decomposition analyses relied on matched observations, which was important because regression and SDA often do not ensure that comparable plots with conservation technology (conserved) and plots without (unconserved) actually exist in the distribution of covariates. All models told a consistent story that the value of crop production for plots with bunds was lower than for plots without bunds. In addition, the yield decomposition results showed that, although there was little difference in endowments between conserved and unconserved plots, the returns to endowments were substantially higher for unconserved plots. Based on these findings, it was hard to avoid the conclusion that these technologies might reduce soil erosion and associated off-site effects, but they did so at the expense of poor farmers in the Ethiopian highlands. We concluded that unless productivity was increased—for example by increasing fodder grass production on bunds—fanya juu bunds reduced on-farm production and therefore could not be characterized as a “win-win” measure to reduce soil erosion.

40|$|Sustainable {{agricultural}} practices require, among other factors, adoption of improved nutrient management techniques, pest mitigation technology and soil conservation measures. Such improved management practices can be tools for enhancing crop productivity. Data on micro-level farm management practices from developing countries is either scarce or unavailable, despite {{the importance of}} their policy implications with regard to resource allocation. The present study investigates adoption of some farm management practices and factors influencing the adoption behavior of farm households in three agrobiodiversity hotspots in India: Kundra block in the Koraput district of Odisha, Meenangadi panchayat in the Wayanad district of Kerala and Kolli Hills in the Namakkal district of Tamil Nadu. Information on farm management practices was collected from November 2011 to February 2012 from 3845 households, of which the data from 2726 farm households was used for analysis. The three most popular farm management practices adopted by farmers include: application of chemical fertilizers, farm yard manure and green manure for managing nutrients; application of chemical pesticides, inter-cropping and mixed cropping for mitigating pests; and <b>contour</b> <b>bunds,</b> grass bunds and trenches for soil conservation. A Negative Binomial count data regression model was used to estimate factors influencing decision-making by farmers on farm management practices. The regression results indicate that farmers who received information from agricultural extension are statistically significant and positively related to the adoption of farm management practices. Another key finding shows the negative relationship between cultivation of local varieties and adoption of farm management practices...|$|R

We also show that greater effectiveness in cooperation in the management of common property resources helps increase income derived from livestock for all categories of households.

When cooperation is only formal, individual activities such as crops, non-agricultural employment, and seasonal migration are pursued as opposed to livestock activities that rely on effective community management of common property resources.

40|$|Cue: Soil {{erosion and}} {{siltation}} of land are two problems that often {{go hand in}} hand. In The Gambia, for example, lowland rice fields frequently suffer from siltation, as erosion in upland areas washes soil particles down into the rivers that irrigate the rice fields. Solving the problem facing the rice farmers is only possible by finding {{a solution to the}} upland problem of erosion. For this reason, the government in The Gambia has launched an 8 year Participatory Integrated Watershed Management Project, known as PIWAMP. This is promoting soil and water conservation in entire river watersheds, including both the upland and lowland areas. For the upland areas, the priority is to build field structures which can increase infiltration of water and reduce erosion. To find out more about how this is being implemented on the ground, Ismaila Senghore spoke Mr Kebba Manka, head of the engineering section of the government?s Soil and Water Management Unit. Ismaila began by asking Mr Manka the implication of managing soil and water across a whole watershed. IN:		?We want to work both in the uplands ?? OUT:		??land degradation and all other implications. ? DUR?N:	 7 ? 20 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Mr Kebba Manka, of The Gambia?s Soil and Water Management Unit, emphasising the key role of soil and water conservation in raising productivity and reducing deforestation. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Manka	We want to work both in the uplands and the lowlands. In the uplands you apply techniques that will keep the soil where it belongs and then conserve also some of the moisture. Because the activities you employ to conserve soil also conserve water. In short, we are trying to protect the rice fields from the activities that are carried out in the uplands. Because activities in the uplands, they result in soil erosion and soil erosion causes deposition of silt sedimentation in the lowlands. That is why we are trying to work in the uplands to protect the rice fields as well. Senghore	Now Mr Manka, what are the key technologies that you are promoting? Which ones would you really want to point out? Manka	There are various techniques and what you apply depends {{on the nature of the}} area you are dealing with. But basically in The Gambia here we are dealing with what we call <b>contour</b> <b>bunds.</b> These are ridges that we insert across the slope in any given field, 50 - 60 metres apart sometimes, and this will help to prevent soil erosion. The basic techniques you apply in the upland are the <b>contour</b> <b>bunds</b> and diversion. Diversion is also another bund but then it is a big bund that is put in a location just at the beginning of the slope so that it will divert some of the water that would have entered the field and caused erosion. Then you divert it and let it go into another area where it will not cause erosion, where you will have prepared already a safe outlet. Senghore	Now what is the role of the beneficiary farming communities in the development and use of the structures you helped establish? Manka	Right now we are talking about the Participatory Integrated Watershed Management. That ?participatory? means that the farmers themselves have a role to play. Our activities are what we call ?demand driven?. Farmers see a problem developing and then we have agricultural agents in the area and they give them forms to fill and they bring these forms to us and we visit the site and this happens every year. We get a lot of requests for assistance from all over the country, but every year you can only do so much. So we go out and then do a reconnaissance survey and select sites that we can handle for the given year. And wherever we go, the projects that we work with, that are sponsoring this programme, would provide material that is unavailable locally. Like if they need cement or something like skilled labour, the project would provide it. And then the farmers are responsible for providing local material. Like if you need sand or gravel or if you need something like local manual labour, the farmers would have to commit themselves to participate in that area so that they will have a sense of ownership of the programme. Because they own the land, they own the crops they are growing there. So if it fails, they fail, and if it succeeds they succeed. So that if the project leaves, they will maintain these structures because they will have seen the benefits of the structures, they will have realised the importance of these structures in their farmland. So they will be an integral part of the farming system. Senghore	How far are farmers adopting the practices that you are pushing? Manka	The upland conservation techniques are adopted very slowly. They cost more than what we do in the lowlands. Because in the upland we normally have to use the service of heavy equipment to raise the bund because the ground is very hard and it is a little bit more expensive and it is not easy for the farmers to raise the bund by hand in that area. This is the situation. I mean the area we have covered is very limited. Like, in every division we have maybe worked in two or three villages that have benefited effectively from upland conservation. But with the advent of PIWAMP [Participatory Integrated Watershed Management Project] now, which is an eight year programme, hopefully we will cover more and more sites every year. Senghore	Now would you say - given the situation that these projects and structures that you established are very capital intensive and labour intensive - would you say farmers will be in any way able to continue developing such structures even when you pull out and when your projects phase out? Manka	Well, to develop them from scratch it may not be very easy without an outside support, for them to do this work very effectively. But once it is established and they have made an effort to maintain them, they are very easy to maintain. Because for the bunds, if you grow Vetiver grass, this grass is drought resistant, animals do not eat it and its root system is very fibrous and can hold the soil together and once it establishes on the bund, the bund can be stable and resistant to erosion almost indefinitely. Senghore	How would you rate the potential of structure programmes to boost our agricultural productivity? Manka	Agriculture is here to stay and the main ingredients are water and soil and they are all limited. So if you are to farm and you want to get something out of your farm you have to farm properly. These techniques, once integrated in your farming system would definitely maintain the yields or increase the yields. Because if you have, let?s say during the rains, if you do not have enough rainfall but you have this structure in your field, the little rainfall that falls could be trapped in the field and that will serve the crop, even when there is a short period of lack of rainfall. And also if you apply a fertiliser it will not be taken away by the runoff and your crops will benefit from that. Whatever you put in your field, if you do not manage the land properly it can be washed away by water, and then the crops will lose it and then your yields will drop. So these structures that you put in the fields, they are to enhance productivity, maintain the soil fertility level and then by preserving moisture and preserving your input like the fertiliser you put in there, whether it is manure or artificial fertiliser, all will stay where they are. If farmers understand and accept this, it should be an integral part of their farming system. There are some countries like, if I am right, in Kenya there is a legislation, that if you are not going to comply with the recommended policy you are not allowed to use the land. We have now a legislation for the forest, we have forest legislation; this should also be applied to soil and water management. Farming should be done in a manner that will protect the natural resources like soil and water. If it cannot be legislated it should be strongly recommended that governments should do all they can to protect the natural resources. These are very limited and water is scarce, land is scarce, populations are increasing. So forests are being encroached and we are having also some repercussions. So if you can apply conservation practices we do not have to cut down more and more forest for agriculture. We can use what is already being cultivated intensively without having to clear bigger areas, which will cause more and more erosion and cause more and more loss of vegetative cover, which can cause desertification, land degradation and all other implications.

30|$|Studies {{revealed}} that SWC has been {{implemented in the}} Tigray Region, of northern Ethiopia since 1985. The implementation was more effective from the early 90 s due to the more emphasis given by the government towards land rehabilitation. The implementation of SWC {{in the region as}} a strategy was to reduce run-off, improve soil fertility and finally reverse the degraded landscape for the betterment of the rural livelihood. This study evaluated changes in vegetation cover following the implementation of SWC measures. Satellite images were used to generate SAVI and LST, whereas long-term AAP records were also used to account for the effects of precipitation. The implementation of different forms of SWC activities, such as area exclosure, stone terraces, soil <b>bunds,</b> <b>contour</b> ditches, moisture retention reservoirs and check dams are an optimal solution to reverse the vegetation degraded landscape of arid and semi-arid regions in Ethiopia. The supplemental survey made in the study area asserts that 95 % of the respondents observed a vegetation cover improvement in their locality over the last 25  years. This was due to the proper implementation of SWC, particularly the practice of area exclosure in protecting from human and livestock interference for better restoration. When degraded landscape protected with different SWC practices, run-off will reduce, infiltration capacity will increase, which retain soil moisture and finally improve vegetation density. In order to achieve such results, the involvement of local communities at all processes in the conservation program is essential. On this matter, Bewket (2007) argued that the success of any SWC intervention depends {{on the extent to which}} the introduced conservation technologies are accepted and adopted by the farmers.|$|R
