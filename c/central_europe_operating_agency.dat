40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe accession of Poland into NATO {{in the spring}} of 1999 raises the question of how western attempts to transfer democratic institutions to new democracies in <b>central</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>operated</b> in reality as concerns reform and reaction. Among the obstacles to this process was a western ignorance about domestic social challenges and political conflicts. These go {{hand in hand with the}} process of democratic transition and show themselves starkly in the case of Polish politics, society and military institutions in the years before 1999. While transitioning to democracy, Poland experienced two types of threats: one from civilian politicians who tried to use the military to accomplish their political goals, and another from military officers with political ambitions. After the collapse of communism in 1989, Polish military forces remained highly visible in domestic politics for almost a decade and the issue of civil-military relations was at the center of government crises on three occasions. Democratic civilian control over military, a requirement to join NATO, became one of the primary political goals of an overwhelming majority of Polish elites since society saw the membership as the best guarantee of national security and a peaceful future. Politicians and government officials who didn't accept or understand this determination were eventually voted out, dismissed, or now exist on the fringes of political life. NATO's plan for Poland to move toward full membership in the alliance resulted in a peaceful democratic transition. Captain, Polish Land Force...|$|R
40|$|This article {{investigates the}} effects of foreign direct {{investment}} on employment generation in <b>Central</b> <b>Europe.</b> Foreign affiliates <b>operate</b> as a buffer to reductions in overall employment and show significant cross-country differences. A model analyzing the contribution of foreign direct investment to restructuring is developed. This model helps interpret the empirical evidence on the link between foreign direct investment and employment in <b>Central</b> <b>Europe.</b> Increasing differentiation in employment between manufacturing industries dominated by foreign affiliates suggests the importance of diversified sources of foreign direct investment for employment generation and preservation. A disaggregate analysis indeed reveals a much more complex and differentiated role of foreign direct investment in employment preservation, employment generation and structural change than the aggregate picture would suggest. This diversity has important policy implications for attracting and upgrading foreign direct investment...|$|R

40|$|This paper studies {{different}} {{conceptions of}} <b>Central</b> <b>Europe</b> {{in the literary}} and historical discourse of the 20 th century, {{and at the same}} time, compares how the concept of <b>Central</b> <b>Europe</b> is defined in the works of Havel, Kundera, Konrád and others. <b>Central</b> <b>Europe</b> has always been a cultural and geographical crossroads between the East and the West, with shifting centres and peripheries, overlapping ethnic groups, cultures and religions. For simplicity, two conceptions of <b>Central</b> <b>Europe</b> can be distinguished: minimalist and maximalist. The minimalist conception regards <b>Central</b> <b>Europe</b> as part of the West, because of analogous historical structures and cultural values. It partly overlaps the original Habsburg Empire and is opposed to the Balkans and Russia. The maximalist conception applies an axiological approach, regarding <b>Central</b> <b>Europe</b> as a set of historically established ideas, connected with the traditions of Christian civilisation, i. e. it includes the eastern and southern corners of <b>Europe</b> as well. <b>Central</b> <b>Europe</b> then is geographically identified with the symbolism of the Danube, as both a dividing and unifiying feature. According to Kundera, it is the Jewish people who have made the greatest contribution to the multicultural character of <b>Central</b> <b>Europe,</b> which after 1945 was politically aligned with the East, although historically it {{had been part of the}} West...|$|R
