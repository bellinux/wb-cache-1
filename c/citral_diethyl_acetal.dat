Therefore, several palladium-catalyzed procedures {{have been reported}} for their synthesis including acrolein dialkylacetal arylation [1]. However, the reaction was not selective and mixtures of aldehyde and ester were obtained those selectivity could be directed {{by the nature of}} the catalytic system. Moreover, these palladium catalysed methodologies remain linked to the use of polar organic solvents like DMF or DMAc that have been recently prohibited in most of the chemical industries.

Pursuing our efforts to develop sustainable processes for fine chemical syntheses we investigated the Heck arylation of acrolein diethylacetal to cinnamaldehydes or 3 -arylpropionic acids in water focusing on the selectivity. The presence of cyclodextrins (CD), known to play a positive role in large range of water phase reaction [2], was evaluated in this work both in the presence of homogeneous or heterogeneous palladium catalysts ([Pd(NH 3) 4 Cl 2] or [Pd]/NaY). Scheme 1 : Products observed during the arylation of acrolein diethylacetal. Under homogeneous conditions, in the presence of NH(iPr) 2 as base, 1 was the main product while cinnamaldehyde 2 was obtained preferentially in the presence of NaOAc.

These procedures are more efficient and surprisingly, in both methods of reductive lithiation, the order of relative reactivity of the substrates differs from that of the method using preformed aromatic radical-anion. Moreover, DMA is significantly cheaper than alternative reductive lithiation catalysts, therefore, can be recycled during work-up, which makes this process more cost-effective.

The supposed dihydroindole compound (a reduction product of alpha-cyano-o-nitrocinnamamide) was actually 2 -amino- 3 -carbamylquinoline (Section A). The general reaction whereby pyrroles and indoles are converted by trihalomethanes/base to 2 -pyrrole and 3 -indole aldehydes, and 3 -halopyridines and quinolines was next examined (Section B). Three instances of the isolation of a dichloromethyl pyrrolenine or indolenine and its subsequent conversion to a pyridine or quinoline are recorded in the literature. The dichloromethyl derivative had therefore been suggested to be an intermediate for both aldehyde formation and the ring expansion. From paper chromatographic experiments the ring expansion of 3 -dichloromethyl- 2 : 3 -dimethylindolenine to 3 -chloro- 2 : 4 -dimethylquinoline {{does not appear to}} occur. But a product whose picrate corresponds, by analysis, to that of 3 -ethoxy- 2 : 4 -dimethylquinoline (and not to 2 : 3 -dimethylindolenine- 3 -aldehyde or its <b>diethyl</b> <b>acetal</b> derivative) has been obtained from the action of sodiumethoxide on 3 -dichloromethyl- 2 : 3 -dimethylindolenine. This suggests that the ring expansion does occur here, possibly by means of a labile intermediary, produced during solvolysis of the dichloromethyl group. A mechanism: has been suggested, and also one for the 'direct' conversion of pyrroles and indoles to pyridines and quinolines.

40|$|The {{production}} of energy and chemicals from renewable resources has gained significant attention as the global effort and legislated requirements to transition from fossil fuels to biofuels intensifies. The synthesis of furfural from biomass has resulted in extensive fine chemical production. The main hydrogenation product of furfural is furfuryl alcohol which has been produced industrially {{with the use of}} a copper chromite catalyst. Elimination of the environmentally toxic Cu-Cr catalyst was the focus of this research culminating in the synthesis of a reusable bimetallic catalyst with high selectivity to furfuryl alcohol. This work initially focused on the synthesis of monometallic catalysts by wet impregnation and concentrated on metals such as platinum, palladium, copper and nickel. Platinum displayed higher selectivity to furfuryl alcohol while palladium showed higher furfural conversion under the conditions studied. Experiments conducted using ethanol as the solvent had a negative effect on the selectivity to the desired product, furfuryl alcohol, with high quantities of 2 -furaldehyde <b>diethyl</b> <b>acetal</b> and difurfuryl ether also formed. Commercial catalysts were employed which confirmed the involvement of ethanol in the formation of additional products. Consequently, toluene was selected as an alternative solvent facilitating selectivity to furfuryl alcohol only under all conditions studied. A 0. 9 %Pt/SiO 2 catalyst was selected as the most suitable catalyst for furfural hydrogenation to furfuryl alcohol following characterisation which highlighted that increased metal loading resulted in a larger particle size and lower metal dispersion. This catalyst became the focus of subsequent research. Subsequently, the focus of the research was the {{production of}} bimetallic catalysts using the 0. 9 %Pt/SiO 2 catalyst as a base for the selection of promoter metals. The bimetallic catalysts were synthesised using the controlled surface reactions technique. It was found that, while the selectivity of all catalysts to furfuryl alcohol was close to 100 %, the conversion was influenced significantly by the promoter metal and followed the order tin>molybdenum>manganese>barium>iron>nickel. Furfural conversion of 47 % and close to 100 % selectivity to furfuryl alcohol was achieved using a 0. 6 %Pt 0. 4 %Sn/SiO 2 catalyst at 100 °C and 20 bar hydrogen pressure. Synthesis techniques including sequential impregnation and co-impregnation were investigated and compared to the controlled surface reactions technique. Coimpregnation was the best technique giving a furfural conversion of 62 % compared to the controlled surface reactions catalyst with 47 % conversion. Detailed characterisation of the controlled surface reactions catalyst 0. 6 %Pt 0. 3 %Sn/SiO 2 (CSR) and the co-impregnation catalyst 0. 7 %Pt- 0. 3 %Sn/SiO 2 (Co-I) demonstrated electronic modifications of the bimetallic catalysts caused by charge transfer from platinum to tin. TEM analysis showed that the particle size ranged from 1. 5 – 3 nm for the co-impregnated catalyst to 1. 5 – 5 nm for the controlled surface reactions catalyst indicating that furfural adsorption was favoured by a smaller particle size. The TOF was 0. 70 s- 1 and 1. 40 s- 1 for the coimpregnated and controlled surface reactions catalysts respectively. The loading of the promoter metal tin synthesised by co-impregnation was also investigated in the range of 0. 0 – 0. 7 wt% which led to the selection of 0. 7 %Pt- 0. 3 %Sn/SiO 2 as the most active catalyst providing a compromise between promoting effect and dilution of the platinum active sites. A thorough investigation of the hydrogenation reaction conditions was also conducted. The investigation found that calcination is necessary and the most active catalyst was calcined at 450 °C. A range of reaction temperatures from 25 – 150 °C showed conversion increased with temperature but furfural desorption was promoted at temperatures above 100 °C while increased hydrogen pressure facilitated an increase in furfural conversion. A kinetic model was established which could estimate the kinetic parameters, activation energy and rate constant, allowing the prediction of the experimental data. Regeneration and reuse of the catalyst showed that reuse of the catalyst is as efficient as regeneration. The influence of solvent on the reaction was also investigated using protic solvents 1 -propanol and 2 -propanol together with aprotic solvents toluene and propanone. The aprotic solvents displayed higher selectivity to furfuryl alcohol but furfural conversion was lower. Although furfuryl alcohol was the main product of both protic solvents additional undesirable products were also formed.

Na preparação do 5 H-pirido[4, 3 -b]indole utilizou-se a estratégia de síntese de isoquinolinas, aplicando a modificação de Jackson da síntese de Pomeranz-Fritsch. A partir do 3 -formilindole e aminoacetaldeído dietil acetal, obteve-se a base de Schiff que posteriormente, foi reduzida à amina com NaBH 4 em etanol. A amina foi tratada com cloreto de tosilo em piridina, originando a sulfonamida, mas após várias tentativas só se conseguiu a ciclização com 29 % de rendimento. Na tentativa de melhorar a etapa da ciclização, realizou-se um estudo por RMN de protão, tendo-se concluído que o produto maioritário da reacção era o composto di-hidro (70 - 75 %) e o piridoindole se formava com rendimento mais baixo (25 - 30 %). Obtiveram-se compostos análogos ao Dimebolin a partir do cloridrato de arilhidrazinas e piperidonas N-substituídas, utilizando a ciclização de Fischer. Os melhores rendimentos foram obtidos com o substituinte CO 2 Et, electro-retirador, na γ-piperidona. Foram preparados dois derivados N-alquilados (metilo e propargilo) a partir de uma tetra-hidro-γ-carbolina com catálise básica. Tentou-se remover o grupo CO 2 Et nas tetra-hidrocarbolinas, tal como está descrito na literatura, recorrendo a catálise básica em etanol ou isopropanol, sob condições de refluxo e micro-ondas. Os rendimentos foram baixos e as reacções não foram reprodutíveis. The aim of {{this work}} was the {{synthesis}} of 5 H-pirido[4, 3 -b]indole and tetra-hydro-γ-carbolines, analogues of Dimebolin, with different substituents, using conventional and micro-wave heating. For the preparation of 5 H-pyrido[4, 3 -b]indole, a method of isoquinoline synthesis was used: the Jackson modification of Pomeranz-Fritsch reaction. Starting from 3 -formylindole and aminoacetaldehyde <b>diethyl</b> <b>acetal,</b> the corresponding imine was obtained and then reduced to the amine with NaBH 4 in ethanol. The amine was tosylated but, after several attempts to cyclise this derivative, the product was obtained in 29 % yield only. On the process of improving the cyclisation, an NMR study was conducted and showed that the major product was the dihydro compound (70 - 75 %) together with the pyrido[4, 3 -b]indole (25 - 30 %). With the view of making analogues of Dimebolin, several tetrahydro-γ-carbolines were prepared from arylhydrazine hydrochlorides and N-substituted piperidones via Fischer cyclisation. The highest yields were obtained with CO 2 Et, an electron withdrawing substituent, on the piperidone. Two alkyl derivatives (methyl and propargyl) were prepared {{from one of the}} tetrahydro-γ-carbolines using basic catalysis. Replacement of CO 2 Et group by H was attempted, as described in the literature, with base in ethanol or isopropanol, using either conventional or micro-wave heating. The yields were, in general, low and the reactions were not reproducible...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} syntheses {{and attempted}} syntheses of certain 3 -substituted oxetanes. Simple oxetanes bearing reactive substituents in the 3 -position are required since the polymerisation of these compounds is anticipated {{to lead to}} polymers of potential use as energetic binders in rocket propellant systems. Oxetanes of particular interest are 3 -hydroxyoxetane, 3, 3 -bis(hydroxymethyl) oxetane, and 3 -(hydroxymethypoxetane. 3 -Hydroxyoxetane was prepared in three steps from epibromohydrin (I). Firstly, Lewis acid-catalysed ring opening of the epoxide {{in the presence of}} acetic acid gave the bromohydrin II. This was heated with ethyl vinyl ether and p-toluenesulphonic acid, and cyclisation of the resulting ether III with strong base afforded the oxetane IV. Deprotection gave 3 -hydroxyoxetane (V). 3 -Hydroxyoxetane (V) underwent reaction with dinitrogen pentaoxide, and the resulting nitrate ester VI was polymerised to give poly- 3 -nitratooxetane 3, 3 -Bis(hydroxymethyl) oxetane (IX) was prepared from pentaerythritol (VIII) via pyrolysis of the carbonate ester X, and by monobromination followed by intramolecular Williamson reaction of the resulting bromohydrin XI. Attempts have been made to synthesise 3 -(hydroxyMethypoxetane (XII) by two main routes. The first involved cyclisation of either 2 -(hydroxymethyl) propane- 1, 3 -diol (XIII) or a protected derivative XIV to give either the oxetane XII itself or the corresponding derivative XV. 2 -(Hydroxymethyl) propane- 1, 3 -diol (XHI) was itself prepared by deamination of 2 -amino- 2 -(hydroxymethyl) propane- 1, 3 -diol (XVI) using hydroxylamine- 0 - sulphonic acid in base, but it could not be cyclised directly. 2, 2 -Dimethy 1 - 5 -(hydroxymethyl) - 5 -nitro- 1, 3 -dioxane (XVIII) was formed by the reaction of 2 -(hydroxymethyl) - 2 -nitropropane- 1, 3 -diol (XVH) with 2 -methoxypropene. The dioxane XVIII was further protected by conversion to 2, 2 -dimethy 1 - 5 - (methanesulphonyloxymethyl) - 5 -nitro- 1, 3 -dioxane (XIX). Hydro-denitration of the nitro-compound XIX using tri-n-butyltin hydride, yielded 2, 2 -dimethy 1 - 5 - (methanesulphonyloxymethyl) - 1, 3 -dioxane (XX), which was hydrolysed to the corresponding diol XXI. Treatment of this methanesulphonyl ester XXI with strong base afforded 3 -(hydroxy/methypoxetane (XV). An attempt to form 2 (t-butyldimethylsilyloxymethyppropane- 1, 3 -diol (XXII) via a five-stage process from allyl t-butyldimethylsilyl ether (xxim) was unsuccessful. Cyclo-addition of the allyl ether XXIII with dichloroketene gave 3 -(tbutyldimethylsilyloxymethyl) - 2, 2 -dichlorocyclobutanone (XXIV) which was dehalogenated to give 3 -(t-butyldimethylsilyloxymethyl) cyclobutanone (XXV). This was converted to <b>diethyl</b> <b>acetal</b> XXVI, but the acetal failed to undergo Baeyer-Villiger oxidation to 5 -(t-butyldimethylsilyloxymethyl) - 2 -oxo- 1, 3 -dioxane (XXVII). A second route to 3 -(hydroxymethyl) oxetane (MI) involved the formation and attempted cyclisation of the glycidyl ether XXVIII to give oxetane XXIX. The epoxide XXVIII was prepared from ethyl bromoacetate and glycidol, but no cyclisation could be effected...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Fresh cider {{spirits are}} {{alcoholic}} beverages mainly constituted by volatile compounds from apples that are formed during fermentation or generated during distillation. In this study {{the chemical and}} sensory changes that take place during the maturation of fresh cider spirits in inert containers made of stainless steel and glass were investigated. RESULTS: The type of container did not influence the maturation process {{for any of the}} studied compounds. Esterification, acetalisation and hydrolysis reactions occurred during the maturation of cider distillates over 24 months, giving rise to several changes in the original composition of this alcoholic beverage, but neither oxidation nor evaporation reactions were detected. A decrease in ethyl acetate, ethyl lactate, <b>diethyl</b> succinate and <b>acetal</b> was observed and an increase in fatty acid ethyl esters and 1, 1, 3 -triethoxypropane. Likewise, the sensory evaluation of the spirits was significantly influenced by the maturation time, with matured samples obtaining higher scores than fresh ones. CONCLUSION: The presence of reactive compounds in recently distilled products makes a period of around 12 months of maturation advisable to reach equilibrium and to improve the sensory assessment of cider distillates consumed in the fresh state...|$|R
