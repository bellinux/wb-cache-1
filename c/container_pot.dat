5000|$|The first {{dates from}} the reign of King John (1199-1216) and was long known as the Testa de Nevill ("Head of Nevill"). The {{classical}} Latin word testa literally means [...] "burnt clay, earthen <b>container,</b> <b>pot,</b> urn", but was also used in a transferred sense to mean [...] "shell, covering". In the low Latin of the Middle Ages the word had acquired the meaning [...] "skull" [...] or [...] "head" [...] (for which the classical Latin word is caput). Maxwell-Lyte suggested that Testa de Nevill originally referred to some receptacle for keeping a particular group of administrative documents, marked as {{it may have been}} by the head of a man named [...] "Nevill", as it had been the custom for officers of the Exchequer to mark certain documentary collections with drawn symbols, such as the heads of important departmental officials. There are too many namesakes from the period to permit his identification, but it is known that several officials surnamed Nevill(e) were associated with the Exchequer during the 13th century, most notably Ralph Neville, the Chancellor himself. An Exchequer Roll of 1298 seems to bear witness to this collection of documents as it mentions a rotulus Teste de Nevill ("roll from (the) Testa de Nevill").|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the quality characteristics for optimization of premix-type Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) Soksungjang (BS). First, {{according to the}} amount of salt (8, 10, 12 %), coliform counts were not detected in BS with 10 or, 12 % salt at 21 days and Bacillus subtilis HJ 18 - 4 as a starter at 7 days. Therefore, 10 % salt with starter culture might be considered as suitable conditions for safety. Second, according to the ratio of water (1 : 1, 1 : 1. 5, 1 : 1. 8), BS prepared with the same weights of meju powder and water showed the highest aminotype nitrogen content (688. 76 ㎎%) at 35 days; thus, an adequate fermentation state was established at this condition compared to others. Third, according to the type of <b>container</b> (<b>pot,</b> plastic, glass), the aminotype nitrogen contents were higher in the plastic container and pot than in the glass bottle. Lastly, according to the batch size (1. 25, 2. 5 ㎏), the coliform of the 2. 5 ㎏ sample decreased faster than that of 1. 25 ㎏ samples at 14 days. These results suggest that BS prepared with the same ratio of water and meju powder fermented with HJ 18 - 4 as a starter and 10 % salt in a pot, plastic container (3 weeks) and glass container (4 weeks) showed desirabl...|$|E

40|$|Alternative pest {{management}} tactics {{were compared to}} conventional tactics for their affect on pest and beneficial arthropods in production nurseries. Alternatives included habitat manipulations and augmentative releases of predators. Groundcover (weed cloth and hard wood mulch) and <b>container</b> position (<b>pots</b> placed above the ground and pots sunken into the ground [pot-in-pot]) were manipulated in nursery beds. Generally, wood mulch enhanced the abundance of alternative prey and natural enemies at the ground level {{but not at the}} soil level within the containers or on plant foliage. The pot-in-pot method strongly increased abundance of both groups at the ground level and the soil level within the <b>containers,</b> whereas <b>pots</b> above ground had a greater abundance of predators on the foliage. Habitat manipulations differentially affected mortality of soil versus foliar herbivores. However, herbivores on the soil in containers suffered greater mortality than those on the foliage, regardless of groundcover or pot position.

40|$|Verticillium wilt is a {{widespread}} soilborne disease of strawberry historically controlled by soil fumigation with methyl bromide (MB). MB was banned by the United Nations in 1995 and will be completely phased out by 2015. Research has concentrated on alternative methods of disease control without finding a single alternative able to replace MB in widespread disease control and yield increase. For the current study, strawberries were greenhouse grown in <b>container</b> <b>pots</b> filled with soil from both infested and non-infested areas of a commercial strawberry field in Watsonville, CA. Treatments included pre-plant soil fumigation with commercially available formulations of methyl bromide, chloropicrin, and 1, 3 -Dichloropropene. Additional treatments included ozone gas (six treatments) and biological control (three treatments). Collected data included total plant yield, individual berry weight, number of fruit produced per plant, plant vegetative weight, infection status, and mineral concentration of fruit (calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron, zinc, manganese, carbon, and nitrogen). Plants grown in ‘clean’ soil were less likely than plants grown in ‘infested’ soil to be infected with Verticillium. Plants grown in soil treated with MB had higher plant weight and yield than did non-treated control. Ozone and biological control treatments did not have statistically higher yield than non-treated control plants nor statistically lower yield than plants grown in soil treated with MB. Individual berry weights had a narrow range {{while the number of}} berries produced per treatment had a wide range. Data suggests strawberry yield is dependent on the number of berries produced per plant.

40|$|A {{non-woven}} capillary matting fabric (Tex-R® Pro), {{coated with}} a latex polymer-based formulation of cupric hydroxide (Spin Out®), developed to cover standing-out areas for weed control and to prevent rooting through, was assessed for its potential to reduce the spread of Phytophthora root rot in container-grown hardy nursery-stock. As well as production bed covers, the fabric was cut into discs and (a) used to cover the tops of plant <b>containers</b> (<b>pot</b> toppers) and (b) inserted to cover {{the holes in the}} bottoms of plant containers (disc inserts). These were all tested as barriers to the passage of infective zoospores of Phytophthora cryptogea in enclosed re-circulating irrigation systems growing test plants of Chamaecyparis lawsoniana. Bed covers and disc inserts significantly reduced disease spread, as indicated by the incidence of symptoms and infection, and by bait and colony-forming unit tests of re-circulating water, both in overhead- and trickle-irrigated systems. Pot toppers were not effective. This may be explained by the mode of spread of Phytophthora in such irrigation systems, which appears to be largely via capillary water and therefore not intercepted by toppers. These results were supported by in vitro studies on the passage of zoospores through fresh and used fabric samples which showed that all Tex-R Pro fabric materials significantly reduced the survival of zoospores and zoospore cysts (to between 0 % and 4. 8 %) compared with untreated fabrics (between 32. 3 % and 42. 8 %). Analysis of Cu 2 + concentrations in re-circulating irrigation water and in matting samples {{at the end of the}} field experiments showed that the majority of the active ingredient stayed bound to the fabric. These results demonstrate that it is possible to deploy Spin Out-treated fabrics in nurseries to help prevent the spread of Phytophthora propagules in addition to their primary use for controlling weeds and rooting through...|$|R
40|$|Plastic {{materials}} have been worldwide applied in agriculture for soil mulching, greenhouse covering, irrigation and drainage pipes, bags, <b>containers,</b> <b>pots,</b> and agrochemical <b>containers.</b> All of these plastic materials require, {{at the end}} of their lifetime, suitable collection and treatment systems. Agricultural activities in some areas of the Apulia Region, Southern Italy, are characterized by huge quantities of plastic wastes and local authorities and farmers associations have been interested in solving this problem by applying modern land management tools such as Geographical Information System (G. I. S.). In this paper a G. I. S. methodology is applied to an area of 10, 200 ha in the Trani municipality, included in the Province of Barletta, Andria, Trani (BAT) - Apulia Region, in order to assess the agricultural plastic waste generation. The use of plastics at the agricultural farms has been investigated and related to the land use by applying statistical analysis, orthophoto analysis and remote sensing surveys. These data were introduced in a specific geo-database, and the agricultural plastic waste quantity and localization were defined. Vineyards and olive groves are scattered in this area, so the agricultural plastic waste mostly consists in irrigation pipes, after-use covering films and anti-hail nets used on vineyards. The analysis carried out showed that up to 614 kg ha- 1 of covering films waste are yearly produced in some areas while the estimation of waste from the anti-hail nets was up to 159 kg ha- 1 and the waste yearly produced from irrigation pipes was up to 83 kg ha- 1. Through the use of the G. I. S., the areas with high density of plastic wastes were pointed out thus allowing to determine the suitable location of temporary storage areas and collecting points, in order to optimize the transport of agricultural plastic waste from the farms to the collecting points and to the recycling firms...|$|R
