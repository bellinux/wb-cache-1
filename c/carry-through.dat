Introduced in 1991, the Classic 4 has stronger lift struts, gear legs, and fuselage <b>carry-through</b> tubes, which allow a gross weight of 1200 lb. The vertical stabilizer and rudder height was increased by 10 in, and the rudder width was increased by 2 in.|$|E
50|$|The {{retractable}} propeller {{is usually}} {{mounted on a}} mast that rotates up and forward out of the fuselage, aft of the cockpit and wing <b>carry-through</b> structure. The fuselage has engine bay doors that open and close automatically, similar to landing gear doors. The engine may be near the top or bottom of the mast, and newer designs have the engine fixed in the fuselage to reduce noise and drag.|$|E

At the beginning of May 2015, the strakes were attached to the airframe. The last major component, the wings, were expected to be delivered in late 2015. In January 2016 XCOR's CEO Jay Gibson said [...] "...we anticipate the wings to be there in the very near future..." [...] and the CTO Michael Valant said they were finding that calibrating the flaps was a challenge. In February 2016 the first prototype was described as a [...] "wingless shell." ...|$|E
5000|$|The ancient Greek {{word for}} {{information}} is πληροφορία, which transliterates (plērophoria) from πλήρης (plērēs) [...] "fully" [...] and φέρω (phorein) frequentative of (pherein) to <b>carry-through.</b> It literally means [...] "fully bears" [...] or [...] "conveys fully". In modern Greek language the word Πληροφορία {{is still in}} daily use and has the same meaning as the word information in English. In addition to its primary meaning, the word Πληροφορία as a symbol has deep roots in Aristotle's semiotic triangle. In this regard it can be interpreted to communicate information to the one decoding that specific type of sign. This is something that occurs frequently with the etymology of many words in ancient and modern Greek language {{where there is a}} very strong denotative relationship between the signifier, e.g. the word symbol that conveys a specific encoded interpretation, and the signified, e.g. a concept whose meaning the interpreter attempts to decode.|$|E

Theater critic Bob Hicks, writing about the performances for The Oregonian, said “... Bag & Baggage's doubleheader is more engaging in concept than onstage. As stimulating as the idea is, and as fun as the whole thing is in fits and starts, the <b>carry-through</b> can get tedious.....too many balls in the air, not enough ease in the juggling...”.

40|$|The {{provisions}} {{of this project}} call {{for the design of}} the structure of the wing and <b>carry-through</b> structure for the Viper primary trainer, which is to be certified as a utility category trainer under FAR part 23. The specific items to be designed in this statement of work were Front Spar, Rear Spar, Aileron Structure, Wing Skin, and Fuselage <b>Carry-through</b> Structure. In the design of these parts, provisions for the fuel system, electrical system, and control routing were required. Also, the total weight of the entire wing planform could not exceed 216 lbs. Since this aircraft is to be used as a primary trainer, and the SOW requires a useful life of 107 cycles, it was decided that all of the principle stresses in the structural members would be kept below 10 ksi. The only drawback to this approach is a weight penalty...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release: {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe preliminary {{development of a}} full-scale Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) for the Close-Range mission was completed at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS). The vehicle was based on half-scale ducted-fan investigations performed at the UAV Flight Research Lab. The resulting design is a fixed-duct, tail-sitter UAV with a canard-configured horizontal stabilizer. Major airframe components are used from previous UAVs and include the wings from a U. S. Army Aquila and the ducted fan from the U. S. Marine Corps AROD. Accomplishments include: 1.) the design and fabrication of a <b>carry-through</b> spar and 2.) the design and construction of an engine test stand. The <b>carry-through</b> spar was designed using finite element analysis and constructed from composite materials. The purpose of the test stand is to measure torque, horsepower, and thrust of an entire ducted fan or an individual engine.

40|$|The blended {{wing-body}} configuration holds a major {{structural design}} challenge at the centre-body where the structure must support both wing bending loads and internal cabin pressure. A membrane approach is proposed which decouples the loads {{to allow their}} resistance by two independent structures: an inner membrane for cabin pressure and an outer structure to resist wing loads. A columned multi-bubble fuselage is proposed for the inner membrane structure, which are multispherical configuration to efficiently withstand the pressure loads. Considering this configuration, the <b>carry-through</b> structure can be designed and optimised. Finite element results show a significant reduction of stress level in this design over that for a conventional multi-bubble fuselage. Up to 30 % weight reduction is achieved for a military cargo application that requires an extensive area with no structural interruption. For the outer <b>carry-through</b> structure, the topology and shape optimisations of finite element models were performed on the given design domain. The results from the shape and topology optimisations were complementary demonstrating a consistent design approach. The optimisation theory is briefly presented along with the results...|$|E

40|$|Several {{experimental}} boron/aluminum structures {{have been}} built for aircraft and space vehicle applications. The success of these structures {{has led to the}} decision to use boron/aluminum tubular struts on the mid-fuselage section of the Space Shuttle Orbiter. The suitability of boron/aluminum for this application has been demonstrated in a program that involved fabricating 100 tubes and performing static, fatigue, corrosion, thermal/mechanical fatigue, and damage tolerance tests on them. Other potential applications for boron/aluminum on the Space Shuttle include the wing <b>carry-through</b> panels and side panels for the mid-fuselage, and the landing gear struts. These applications result in significant weight savings over conventional non-composite designs at moderate costs. Boron/aluminum can now be considered a production material that, in many cases, is competitive on a weight and/or cost basis with an all-metal or resin composite system...|$|E
40|$|Flight flutter {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on an experimental airplane {{which resulted in the}} successful prediction of a limited amplitude stabilizer flutter at supersonic speeds. The flutter obtained was unusual in that fore and aft bending of the stabilizer <b>carry-through</b> structure contributed to the flutter condition. During flight tests the impending flutter condition was observed from force per unit amplitude, damping coefficient, and frequency measurements. A description is given of the physical and operational characteristics of the test equipment and telemetering facilities. A flutter analysis using measured modes and incompressible two-dimensional strip air forces yielded a conservative flutter speed. Sled tests of a similar stabilizer configuration had lead to the conclusion that flutter would not be encountered. Certain overall conclusions are reached regarding this particular flight flutter testing program and the need for a concerted research effort in this field...|$|E

Test objectives were to investigate thermal protection system (TPS) tile sensitivity to extreme pressure gradients and vibration and to define the TPS aerodynamic environment. The model utilized for OS 8 was a full-scale representation of {{a portion of the}} space shuttle orbiter lower wing <b>carry-through</b> structure forward of the aft tank strut and propellant lines.

30|$|RSpring has {{implemented}} {{several other}} algorithms. For instance, the NLAT (Noncovered Load-Amortizing Tune) shown in Fig.  3 (c) {{is similar to}} the CLAT algorithm in Fig.  3 (a). However, we can see that in NLAT, “fairness” is more highlighted than that in CLAT. Because the curve of L can be upgraded before the curve of H (i.e., the curve of H does not always cover that of L). That is why NLAT is named as: Noncovered Load-Amortizing Tune. For another instance, the NCTT (Noncovered <b>Carry-Through</b> Tune) in Fig.  3 (d) is similar to CCTT in Fig.  3 (b). Their main difference is that in NCTT, “fairness” is highlighted at the granularity of “AC.” Because in NCTT the curve of L can be upgraded before the curve of H, and because L will be upgraded all the way to its highest level before H can be upgraded.|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} is {{made between the}} relative levels of aircraft interior noise related to structureborne and airborne paths for the same propeller source. A simple, but physically meaningful, model of the structure treats the fuselage interior as a rectangular cavity with five rigid walls. The sixth wall, the fuselage sidewall, is a stiffened panel. The wing is modeled as a simple beam carried into the fuselage by a large discrete stiffener representing the <b>carry-through</b> structure. The fuselage interior is represented by analytically-derived acoustic cavity modes and the entire structure is represented by structural modes derived from a finite element model. The noise source for structureborne noise is the unsteady lift generation on the wing due to the rotating trailing vortex system of the propeller. The airborne noise source is the acoustic field created by a propeller model consistent with the vortex representation. Comparisons are {{made on the basis}} of interior noise over a range of propeller rotational frequencies at a fixed thrust...|$|E
40|$|A subsonic tilt-nacelle V/STOL {{aircraft}} configuration is described which {{is powered by}} two turbofan engines, mounted on a single <b>carry-through</b> structure {{that is designed to}} maintain the thrust axis close to the center of gravity at nacelle incidences of 5 - 95 deg. Control during V/STOL operation, often from small ship platforms, is achieved by means of a vane assembly that is immersed in each turbofan's exhaust. Wind tunnel test data have been obtained with an 11. 2 -m wing span model for the vertical-to-horizontal flight transition capability of the concept. It is found that the aircraft can operate over a broad transition corridor, with sufficient maneuver capability about the trim points. The control vane exhibited linear response characteristics over a large deflection range, with little influence from power, angle of attack or ground proximity in hover. The model induced a positive ground effect in hover that increased as wheel height was approached and strake angle increased...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} a predictive capability, comprising analytical and numer-ical models, {{for the development}} and assessment of thermal line-scanning, an emerging non-destructive technique for the rapid inspection of aircraft struc-tural components. The models describe the two-dimensional heat diffusion process pertaining to {{the application of a}} thermal line source to an object moving at constant velocity. Relevant case studies are considered including delamination in a composite laminate and cracking in a metal plate. Numeri-cal experiments show that for planar flaws aligned with the inspection surface the performance of thermal line scanning is broadly equivalent to that of con-ventional flash thermography. In contrast, for a surface-breaking crack, where the flaw plane is typically perpendicular to the scan direction, strong lateral heat flows induced by a narrow beam provide a superior basis for inspection. For problems that involve distributed cracking, like in the wing <b>carry-through</b> bulkhead in the F/A- 18 aircraft, the technique could offer an advantage over more conventional methods of inspection...|$|E
40|$|The Microwave Fower Beam Ionosphere {{effects and}} {{critical}} interfaces between th Microwave Power Transmission System (MPTS) and the Satellite were studied {{as part of}} the NASA/MSFC continuing research on the feasibility of power transmission from geosynchronous orbit. Theoretical predications of ionospheric modifications produced by the direct interaction of the MPTS on the earth's upper atmosphere are used to determine their impact on the performance of the Microwave Power Beam and Pilot Beam System as well as on other RF systems effected by the ionosphere. A technology program to quantitatively define these interactions is developed. Critical interface areas between the MPTS and the satellite which could {{have a major impact on}} cost and performance of the power system are idenfified and analyzed. The areas selected include: use of either a 20 kV versus 40 kV Amplitron, thermal blockage effects of Amplitron heat radiation by the satellite structure, effect of dielectric <b>carry-through</b> structure on power beam, and effect of material sublimation on performance of the Amplitron in Geosynchronous Orbit...|$|E
40|$|Computer {{animation}} projects, specifically {{feature film}} productions, require large teams of artists {{to manage and}} coordinate the use of enormous amounts of data containing both aesthetic and technical information within a specific time frame and while using finite resources. Mismanagement through information loss or inefficiency can result in both a compromised artistic vision and a financial loss. This thesis presents the conceptualization of a work management system based upon a successful system used in architecture and construction called Building Information Modeling, or BIM. BIM principles are adapted for use in animation production {{through the use of}} images as containers of information. The thesis does not include implementation of the management system described but does predict, based upon comparisons with architecture and construction, that a significant level of information <b>carry-through</b> can be achieved from concept art to final frames and we expect a positive gains in the efficient use of production resources. Adoption of this proposed project management structure could reduce production budgets, improve the communication flow between directors and artists, and develop an empirical based record for predicting the resource usage requirements for proposed projects in the future...|$|E
40|$|A flutter test using a scaled {{model of}} an {{advanced}} composite wing for a Navy attack aircraft {{has been conducted}} in the NASA Langley Research Center Transonic Dynamics Tunnel. The model was a wall-mounted half-span wing with a semi-span of 6. 63 ft. The wing had an aspect ratio of 5. 31, taper ratio of 0. 312, and quarter-chord sweep of 25 degrees. The model was supported {{in a manner that}} simulated the load path in the <b>carry-through</b> structure of the aircraft and the symmetric boundary condition at the fuselage centerline. The model was capable of carrying external stores from three pylon locations on the wing. Flutter tests were conducted for the wing with and without external stores. No flutter was encountered for the clean wing at test conditions which simulated the scaled airplane operating envelope. Flutter boundaries were obtained for several external store configurations. The flutter boundaries for the fuel tanks were nearly Mach number independent (occurring at constant dynamic pressure). To study the aerodynamic effect of the fuel tank stores, pencil stores (slender cylindrical rods) which had the same mass and pitch and yaw inertia as the fuel tanks were tested on the model. These pencil store configurations exhibited a transonic dip in the flutter dynamic pressure, indicating that the aerodynamic effect of the actual fuel tanks on flutter was significant. Several flutter analyses methods were used in an attempt to predict the flutter phenomenon exhibited during the wind-tunnel test. The analysis gave satisfactory predictions of flutter for the pencil store configurations, but unsatisfactory correlation for the actual fuel tank configurations...|$|E
40|$|A common {{technique}} to evaluate load paths in complex structures is to perform FE-calculations with relative large elements. This procedure gives no information regarding stress concentrations at e. g. holes or radius but this phenomenon can later on be investigated in details with local individual submodels. Displacements {{is taken from}} the global model and used to analyse stress concentrations and crack driving parameters in the submodel. Today, the crack controlling stress intensity factors are in general cases obtained from handbook solutions of elementary cases. This method requires engineering judgements in a conservative manner and one way to improve {{the solution is to}} model the crack in its correct surroundings in a local three-dimensional submodel. This master thesis is focused on the development of an automated support for analysing three-dimensional cracks in submodels. The results from a global Nastran model can be imported to Trinitas and used for a more accurate stress and fatigue life analysis in a local model. Here a three-dimensional crack tip subdomain can be generated inside an eight point brick volume. The crack tip subdomain is specially designed and adjusted for accurate determination of stress intensity factors along the crack front. For example, all points are adjusted with respect to the brick volume and the crack size, triangular wedge elements are applied around the crack tip, the midpoints for these elements are moved to quarter points and the crack front is curved. The crack tip subdomain is validated against several reference cases and shows sufficiently good results with respect to the stress intensity factor. Finally, the automated crack tip subdomain generation is applied to a geometrically complex part of a main wing <b>carry-through</b> bulkhead of a fighter aircraft in order to show the applicability of the procedure in an industrial environment...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{relationship}} between writing competence and identity has been increasingly investigated {{in the research}} literature. Writing competence entails more than simply the words that are communicated through the act of writing, but also represents the writer’s identity {{in terms of her}} or his relationship with (similar) others, how she or he is connected to others, what power relations regulate the {{relationship between}} the individual and the group, etc. One particular difficulty encountered by L 2 writers is the need to construct a writer’s identity in another language that is not exactly like the one they are used to working with in their L 1, and of which they may not even be aware. Raising awareness of their own cultural assumptions as writers is as important in shaping writer competence as helping them to see differences between their cultural L 1 writer identity and that of the L 2. An international writing research project of the scope described in this study is well-suited to addressing this need. In this presentation, we will present results from an ongoing international collaborative project between undergraduate and graduate writers from two universities: Blaise Pascal University in Clermont-Ferrand (France) and the University of Michigan-Dearborn. A previous phase of the study examined the effects of intercultural peer review on the writing strategies of second year students at the two universities. In the current phase, we will study the effects of the exchange between advanced undergraduate students (U. Mich) and graduate students in technical communication (UBP) on the development of their notions of audience, especially as it pertains to their awareness of the constraints of writing for international audiences. The intercultural peer review is a strong tool for learning about one’s writer identity and about constructing appropriate voice. Although peer review is not typically used in the NNE writing classroom in French universities and students had little to no experience with the technique, the intercultural peer review allowed them {{to gain a better understanding}} of how to construct their voices for an international audience. In particular, it was interesting to observe the individual <b>carry-through</b> in the expression of voice as a result of collaborative work on raising rhetorical and genre awareness. Because voice is both socially and culturally situated, students were brought to reflect on their multiple identities (social, cultural and personal) and how these identities come to be portrayed in their own and others’ writing...|$|E
40|$|The world’s first commercial-scale CO₂ capture {{plant in}} Boundary Dam power station uses amine-based {{post-combustion}} CO₂ capture (PCC) technology (Boundary Dam, Canada). The issues of large energy requirement and high cost have hindered worldwide deployment of PCC. Flexible operation {{has been proposed}} {{as a way to}} improve the economic and technical feasibility of PCC. Flexible operation coordinates reductions in CO₂ emissions with electricity demand by: (i) ramping up CO₂ capture during periods of low energy demand, and (ii) turning down or switching off CO₂ capture during high energy demand. The immediate and long term impact of process disturbances from flexible operation is unclear. This thesis investigates the technical influence of flexible operation during amine-based CO₂ capture from brown coal derived flue gas. Dynamic pilot plant studies have provided practical experience in flexible operation of PCC plants. The pilot plant study demonstrates the successful implementation of flexible operation in the form of parameter step-changes to a PCC process. The PCC pilot plant is run by CSIRO and located at AGL Loy Yang in Australia. The operation of the PCC plant under a broad range of transient conditions has captured the dynamics of the process and provides suitable data dynamic model validation. Additionally, the density meters provide the advantage for online monitoring of liquid CO₂ concentration. Statistical analysis revealed that data variance may occur due to changes in: (i) ambient temperature, (ii) MEA concentration, or (iii) amine degradation. Although PCC plants of different scales and configurations have different response times, it is likely the dynamic trends to parameter changes would be similar. Thus, the dynamic behaviour observed in this thesis is of greater significance compared to the absolute values. Based on this study, changing the flue gas flow rate would produce the most rapid response. The greatest CO₂ removal percentage was achieved at the lowest flue gas flow rate or at the highest absorbent flow rate. However, the latter provides high CO₂ removal percentage with significantly lower reboiler heat duty in terms of MJ/kg CO₂. The steam pressure parameter provides the ability to adjust the temperature of all the columns simultaneously. This effect may be used to compensate for effects from ambient conditions or heat losses. Flexible operation of PCC is modelled using Aspen Plus Dynamics®. Dynamic modelling of flexible PCC operation in the pilot plant uses the following stand-alone models: (i) Absorber Column 2 (ABS 2), (ii) Absorber column 1 (ABS 1), and (iii) Stripper Column. Stand-alone models provide the advantage of greater flexibility compared to integrated models; also they <b>carry-through</b> of successive errors is avoided. Additionally, disturbances can be introduced to intermediate streams without convergence issues. Each stand-alone model simulates the following flexible operation scenarios: (i) step-changes in flue gas flow rate, (ii) step-changes in absorbent flow rate, and (iii) step-changes in steam pressure. Modelling of property changes individually, elucidates which properties generate the dynamic responses observed in the pilot plant. The overall effect observed in the step-changes scenarios {{was the result of a}} combination of property changes that occur in tandem. The combination of these property changes accurately describes the dynamic behaviour observed in the pilot plant results. Although the dynamic modelling could not replicate the absolute values obtained in the pilot plant, the models demonstrated the same trends observed in pilot plant results. The modelled behaviour and pilot plant observations are in agreement for comparisons of the following results: (i) column temperature, (ii) CO₂ composition of the liquid product, (iii) CO₂ composition of the vapour product, and (iv) CO₂ removal/capture percentage. Modelled dynamic response is in agreement with pilot plant trends, despite the influence of non-ideal conditions (e. g. amine degradation, ambient temperature effects, heat loss). Some key novel outcomes of the dynamic modelling include: (i) Model specifications in Aspen Plus® and Aspen Plus Dynamics® are based on data from the CSIRO PCC pilot plant at AGL Loy Yang; (ii) Modelling of a PCC process with a double-absorber configuration; (iii) The process of converting equilibrium reactions into forward/reverse kinetic reactions is documented in detail; (iv) The number of equilibrium stages for this PCC study is greater compared to previous Aspen Plus Dynamics® studies by Lin et al. (2011), Lin et al. (2012) and Léonard et al. (2013); (v) Demonstrated the necessity of adjustment factors to achieve model agreement with experimental data (particular when pilot plant data is affected by non-ideal conditions); (vi) Compared the precision of different mass transfer coefficient correlations for rate-based PCC modelling...|$|E
