500|$|During the 1930s and 1940s, Parker {{became an}} {{increasingly}} vocal advocate of causes like {{civil liberties and}} civil rights, and a frequent critic of those in authority. She reported on the Loyalist cause in Spain for the Communist magazine The New Masses in 1937. At the behest of Otto Katz, a covert Soviet Comintern agent and operative of German Communist Party agent Willi Muenzenberg, Parker helped to found the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League in 1936 (which was suspected by the FBI of being a Communist Party front). The Hollywood Anti-Nazi League's membership eventually grew to some 4,000 strong. Its often wealthy members' contributions (probably not intended to support Communism) were, {{in the words of}} David <b>Caute,</b> [...] "able to contribute as much to [...] Party funds as the whole American working class".|$|E

2500|$|Soviet leader Khrushchev {{was still}} concerned, writes {{historian}} David <b>Caute,</b> that “her defection {{would have been}} useful for the West as anti-Soviet propaganda.” She wrote him “a long and forthright expression of her patriotism and her indignation {{that it should be}} doubted.” Subsequently, the travel ban was lifted in 1959 on Khrushchev’s personal intercession, as it became clear to him that striking Plisetskaya from the Bolshoi's participants could have serious consequences for the tour’s success. In his memoirs, Khrushchev writes that Plisetskaya “was not only the best ballerina in the Soviet Union, but the best in the world.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} one of the few foreign-language {{pictures}} to be presented in the BBC's program Current Release; former war correspondent Matthew Halton was invited to comment on it. The American magazine Variety described it as [...] "The Russian answer to the many American and British films about the war... having some contemporary significance, in the light of the tensions between the West and the Soviet Union." [...] The New York Times' critic dubbed it as a [...] "deafening blend of historical pageantry and wishful thinking... directed as if his (Chiaureli's) life depended upon it" [...] and – in what author David <b>Caute</b> claimed was the worse condemnation which could be leveled at it in the day – that it had a [...] "Hollywood-style plot". He also disapproved of the historical veracity of the Yalta Conference scene, while John Howard Lawson, recently released from prison, praised it as an authentic depiction of events. Officials in Artkino, the picture's American distributor, claimed the film was [...] "already witnessed by 1.2 million people" [...] in the United States by 9 June 1952, a day after its release there.|$|E

50|$|In an {{abandoned}} quarry below the church an ancient relief {{of the god}} Mithras sacrificing a bull, with the cult characteristic images of <b>Cautes</b> and Cautopates, Sol, a scorpion, a snake, a dog, and a raven, indicate this {{was the site of}} a late 2nd-century Mithraeum.|$|R
50|$|An {{alternate}} interpretation {{advanced by}} David Ulansey is that <b>Cautes</b> represents the spring equinox and Cautopates the autumn equinox. Thus, {{represented on the}} left and right of the Tauroctony, they become a realistic cadre of the celestial equator and the constellations included between the two equinoxes during the Age of Taurus.|$|R
50|$|Seldom {{absent from}} the reliefs, and also {{sometimes}} included in free-standing tauroctony statuary, are representations of <b>Cautes</b> and Cautopates, the torchbearering twins that appear as miniature versions of Mithras, respectively holding a raised torch and a lowered torch. Usually, <b>Cautes</b> stands {{to the right of}} the scene while Cautopates on the left. In fifty tauroctony scenes, their positions are reversed, and in rare cases (such as the very earliest CIMRM 593), they are both on one side of the scene. The torchbearers commonly appear with crossed legs. On a number of reliefs, greenery or a tree is placed in the vicinity, sometimes on both sides of the bull, and at other times, such as at Nida (Germany) as a wreath around the relief. As Siscia in Pannonia Superior (Sisak, Croatia) a similar wreath is made of ears of wheat (CIMRM 1475).|$|R

50|$|Roger Beck has {{hypothesized}} a third processional Mithraic ritual, {{based on}} the Mainz cup and Porphyrys. This so-called Procession of the Sun-Runner features the Heliodromus, escorted by two figures representing <b>Cautes</b> and Cautopates (see below) and preceded by an initiate of the grade Miles leading a ritual enactment of the solar journey around the mithraeum, which was intended to represent the cosmos.|$|R
2500|$|The image {{may be a}} relief, or free-standing, {{and side}} details may be present or omitted. [...] The centre-piece is Mithras clothed in Anatolian costume and wearing a Phrygian cap; who is {{kneeling}} on the exhausted [...] bull, holding it by the nostrils [...] with his left hand, and stabbing it with his right. As he does so, he {{looks over his shoulder}} towards the figure of Sol. A dog and a snake reach up towards the blood. A scorpion seizes the bull's genitals. A raven is flying around or is sitting on the bull. Three ears of wheat are seen coming out from the bull's tail, sometimes from the wound. The bull was often white. The god is sitting on the bull in an unnatural way with his right leg constraining the bull's hoof and the left leg is bent and resting on the bull's back or flank. The two torch-bearers are on either side, dressed like Mithras, <b>Cautes</b> with his torch pointing up and Cautopates with his torch pointing down. Sometimes <b>Cautes</b> and Cautopates carry shepherds' crooks instead of torches.|$|R
50|$|Gillam {{found two}} heads of <b>Cautes</b> and Cautopates, and speculated {{that this was}} the result of a {{deliberate}} decapitation of the statues. The lack of any trace of the tauroctony was also used to argue for a deliberate desecration of the shrine; however, in the absence of any single fragment of it and without knowing what the statue smashed in 1844 was of, it is hard to say for sure. Certainly pottery evidence spread over the temple shows that it was out of use by the mid-fourth century.|$|R
