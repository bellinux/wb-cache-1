50|$|In {{international}} {{comparative research}} on campaign practices {{the study by}} political scientists Gunda and Fritz Plasser revealed a hybridization of global campaign practices and local political culture in 19 countries in 2002. With regard to international comparative research on election news coverage, e.g. Jesper Strömbäck and Toril Aalberg in 2008 explained diversities in similar countries like Sweden and Norway by different framing concepts, media bias as well as cultural and structural variations. Differences in political news culture were first examined in 2008 by Frank Esser who developed a typology of political television news culture by a <b>cross-analysis</b> of sound bite and image bite news in France, Germany, UK, and the U.S.. Regarding the extent of journalistic or editorial influence an interventionist U.S. American approach, a moderately interventionist Anglo-German approach, and a noninterventionist French approach were identified. A market-orientation of political campaigning addressing voters as consumers of a political product was revealed by political scientist David M. Farrell in 2002. Lynda L. Kaid and Christina Holtz-Bacha examined political TV advertising in 12 countries in 2006. By, e.g., an analysis of structural country-specific TV campaigning restrictions and a content analysis of the TV adverts, the two communications scientists identified transnational campaigning trends such as the emphasis of political issues and the disregard of party issues.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{statistics}} {{analysis and}} <b>cross-analysis</b> {{were carried out}} on the 961 intersection accidents to acquire intersection safety affecting factors to provide a reference to intersection design and renovation. 961 intersection accidents were collected from ten roads of Sichuan, Yunnan and Chongqing between 2007 and 2010. First, the paper analyzed intersection types, alignments, control types, crash types, and crash contributing factors. Second, the paper carried out the <b>cross-analysis</b> between crash types and crash contributing factors. Finally, the paper established {{the relationship between the}} design factors, the crash contributing factors and crash types. The statistical analysis results showed that the intersection of mountainous highway need to be further improved in terms of the right-of-way facilities, road alignment etc. The <b>cross-analysis</b> results showed that many intersection crashes could be avoided if the intersection could be reasonably designed, although the crashes were mainly caused by traffic participant's failing to comply with traffic rules...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we analyze a {{large amount}} of {{infection}} data for three major botnets: Conficker, MegaD, and Srizbi. These botnets represent two distinct types of botnets in terms of the methods they use to recruit new victims. We propose the use of <b>cross-analysis</b> between these different types of botnets as well as between botnets of the same type in order to gain insights into the nature of their infection. In this analysis, we examine commonly-infected networks which appear to be extremely prone to malware infection. We provide an in-depth passive and active measurement study to have a fine-grained view of the similarities and differences for the two infection types. Based on our <b>cross-analysis</b> results, we further derive new implications and insights for defense. For example, we empirically show the promising power of cross-prediction of new unknown botnet victim networks using historic infection data of some known botnet that uses the same infection type with more than 80 % accuracy. ...|$|E

40|$|In this {{abstract}} {{the authors}} briefly describe their findings in location-based game (LBG) design research, {{along with their}} goals for attending the International Conference on Japan Game Studies (ICJGS). Within the field of LBGs design researchers use the terms location-based, mobile, unique artworks and transmedia storytelling to express {{the use of technology}} to the broader social and cultural context of the medium. More commonly the term is used to describe a type of story-narrative that is delivered though multiple channels. The LBG narrative is usually broken into segments of which the audience must find and assemble[1]. The audience sometimes works as a collective and may {{play a key role in}} creating the fiction[9]. Over the last 5 -years, our research lab has used various ethnographic methods to compare the LBG design process to the participant’s experience[3]. This <b>cross-analysis</b> has lead to a deeper understanding of how people engage with the cultural phenomena of play, and more importantly- meaning. In the sections that follow we introduce two experimental case studies we plan to present as examples of LBG <b>cross-analysis</b> studies.

40|$|Deployment {{and use of}} {{technological}} services for informal carers is still limited, mainly due to users' low digital skills, the lack of demonstrated business cases, and the poor evidence of the impact and sustainability of these services. The CARICT project aimed to collect evidence-based results {{on the impact of}} ICT-enabled domiciliary care services, and to make policy recommendations to develop, scale and replicate them in the European Union. The methodology was based on a mapping of 52 ICT-based services for informal carers developed in Europe, and a <b>cross–analysis</b> of 12 of these initiatives to get data on their impacts, drivers, business models, success factors, and challenges. The main results show that there is a wide range of successful, not very costly and beneficial examples of ICT-based support for carers across Europe. The <b>cross-analysis</b> indicated that these services had positive impacts on {{the quality of life of}} elderly people and informal carers, the quality of care and the financial sustainability of the health and social systems. The data also confirm that policy at European, national, regional and local levels can promote the successful development, implementation and transferability of these services through funding, policy leadership and by promoting stronger cooperation among stakeholders including end-users, mainly from the third sector and informal carers, to create a new value chain in the provision of long-term care. These findings help to achieve the objectives of European policy defined by the 2020 Strategy, and more specifically the Digital Agenda for Europe (DAE) and the European Innovation Partnership on Healthy and Active Ageing (EIP AHA).

Through a <b>cross-analysis</b> [in the sense lent to this term by Passeron and Revel], of two athletes whose sporting achievements generated debates – Oscar Pistorius and Caster Semenya – we will underline the fundamental role of technology, which consists in instituting, in secret, reality that is always more significant from a sporting standpoint...|$|E
40|$|Serial {{analysis}} of gene expression (SAGE) {{is a powerful}} quantification technique for gene expression data. The huge 		amount of tag data in SAGE libraries of samples is difficult to analyze with current SAGE analysis tools. Data is often not 		provided in a biologically significant way for <b>cross‐analysis</b> and ‐comparison, thus limiting its application. 		Hence, an integrated software platform that can perform such a complex task is required. Here, we implement set theory for 		cross‐analyzing gene expression data among different SAGE libraries of tissue sources; up‐ or down‐regulated 		tissue‐specific tags can be identified computationally. Extract‐SAGE employs a genetic algorithm (GA) to reduce the 		number of genes among the SAGE libraries. Its representative tag mining will facilitate {{the discovery of the}} candidate genes with 		discriminating gene expression...|$|E
