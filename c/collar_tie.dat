25|$|Although {{the exact}} date of {{his arrival in}} British Columbia is unknown, it is {{recorded}} that he was packing {{at the beginning of}} the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush in 1858 and continued until 1912, a span of 54 years. He wore the same type of clothing year round: a boiled white shirt, heavy woolen pants, riding boots and no socks. When he had business to conduct, he added a <b>collar,</b> <b>tie</b> and a French hat to his apparel.|$|E

60|$|The {{secretary}} and chairman stuck out deprecatory heads and coaxed the mob. Carl's manager {{was an old}} circus-man. He had removed his <b>collar,</b> <b>tie,</b> and flashy diamond pin, and was diligently wrapping the thong of a black-jack about his wrist. Their mechanic was crawling under {{the side of the}} tent. Carl caught him by the seat of his overalls and jerked him back.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} these {{additional}} tests was twofold: to attempt to establish criteria by which unconventional roof frames, such as roof trusses might be evaluated; and to determine the difference in strength between conventional joist-rafter constructions built with 2 by 4 <b>collar</b> <b>ties</b> and those with 1 by 5 <b>collar</b> <b>ties.</b> Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
60|$|Both came to {{the spot}} promptly, and, without {{preliminary}} talking, took off their coats, <b>collars,</b> <b>ties,</b> and caps. A ring was formed, and Dick stepped forward and faced Baxter.|$|R
60|$|Taking {{off their}} shoes and <b>collars,</b> <b>ties</b> and coats, the boys said their prayers and laid down. Sam was soon {{in the land}} of dreams, and {{presently}} Tom and Dick followed.|$|R
6000|$|Mabel {{tells me}} she was quite paralysed with horror, she did nothing all the time, but the two Miss Buntings, {{recovering}} a little, screamed out, [...] "Oh, she's drowning!" [...] and hastened {{to get out of}} the sea at once, a proceeding accelerated by Mrs. Bunting, who with great presence of mind pulled at the ropes with all her weight and turned about and continued to pull long after they were many yards from the water's edge and indeed cowering in a heap at the foot of the sea wall. Miss Glendower became aware of a crisis and descended the steps, [...] "Sir George Tressady" [...] in one hand and the other shading her eyes, crying in her clear resolute voice, [...] "She must be saved!" [...] The maids of course were screaming--as became them--but the two men appear to have acted with the greatest presence of mind. [...] "Fred, Nexdoors ledder!" [...] said Mr. Randolph Bunting--for the next-door neighbour instead of having convenient stone steps had a high wall and a long wooden ladder, and it had often been pointed out by Mr. Bunting if ever an accident should happen to anyone there was that! In a moment it seems they had both flung off jacket and vest, <b>collar,</b> <b>tie</b> and shoes, and were running the neighbour's ladder out into the water.|$|E
50|$|<b>Collar</b> <b>tie</b> is a {{grappling}} clinch {{hold that}} is used to control the opponent. It is performed {{from the front of the}} opponent by grabbing the opponent by the collar, behind the neck, or behind the trapezius muscle. A <b>collar</b> <b>tie</b> using one hand is called a single <b>collar</b> <b>tie,</b> and a <b>collar</b> <b>tie</b> with both hands is called a double <b>collar</b> <b>tie.</b>|$|E
50|$|The apex of {{the western}} gable roof has cast iron panels fixed between a <b>collar</b> <b>tie</b> {{supported}} by decorative timber brackets and a king post running {{up to the roof}} and supporting a cross.|$|E
50|$|The west wing's {{second floor}} {{has a large}} landing with beaded woodwork. It leads to a master bedroom and two smaller bedrooms. The entire floor has its {{original}} wideboard flooring. The roof framing uses king post trusses on the <b>collar</b> <b>ties</b> rather than the more commonly used tie beam formation, a construction visible in the master bedroom.|$|R
50|$|Both {{sections}} of the building are clad internally with tongue and grooved boarding. The ceilings which {{are in the same}} material follow the rafter line {{to the bottom of the}} <b>collar</b> <b>ties</b> where they become flat. The 1897 building contains offices; the Court Room retains elements of early furniture that include the Judges bench, dock, reporters benches and clerks tables. The interior of the Court Room also displays the trade certificate of the carpenter.|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless, {{they are}} confident. They cannot {{understand}} the middle-class diffidence {{of the young}} men who wear <b>collars</b> and <b>ties</b> and finger-rings.|$|R
50|$|A {{collar beam}} or collar is a {{horizontal}} member between two rafters {{and is very}} common in domestic roof construction. Often a collar is structural {{but they may be}} used simply to frame a ceiling. A collar beam is often called a <b>collar</b> <b>tie</b> but this is rarely correct. A tie in building construction is an element in tension rather than compression and most collar beams are designed to work in compression to keep the rafters from sagging. A collar {{near the bottom of the}} rafters may replace a tie beam and be designed to keep the rafters from spreading, thus are in tension: these are correctly called a <b>collar</b> <b>tie.</b>|$|E
50|$|The roof {{forms are}} gabled and clad in {{corrugated}} colourbond. The gables are infilled with vertical boarding {{which has a}} scalloped bottom edge and supported {{at the lower end}} by an exposed <b>collar</b> <b>tie.</b> The apex of the gable is surmounted by a timber finial.|$|E
50|$|The {{ceiling is}} divided into six bays by curved and moulded timber brackets, joined by tie rods across the room. A pressed metal ceiling rose is centred within each bay. The ceiling also is lined with beaded boards, running diagonally where the ceiling rakes up to the <b>collar</b> <b>tie.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{sculpture}} by Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen, called Inverted <b>Collar</b> and <b>Tie</b> {{is set up}} in front of the entrance.|$|R
25|$|The {{sanctuary}} is sparely furnished. Gently curved wooden pews with scroll armrests and recessed end panels flank {{the center}} aisle, {{leading to the}} altar. Its wooden flooring is now carpeted; the plaster walls have beaded wainscoting. Above, the wooden trusses with chamfered lower chords and <b>collar</b> <b>ties</b> that frame the roof are exposed. At {{the end of the}} aisle is the altar on a raised dais. On it is a wooden lectern with Greek Revival detailing.|$|R
60|$|The man solemnly {{took off}} his coat, unfastened his <b>collar</b> and <b>tie</b> and turned up his shirt sleeves as though he meant business.|$|R
5000|$|In Muay Thai, the {{stand-up}} clinch {{is effectively}} utilized. However, its grappling attacks {{are limited to}} sweeps, as the clinch is mainly used for setting up uppercuts and strikes from the knees and elbows. The primary clinch in this art {{is known as the}} Thai Plum or the <b>Collar</b> <b>Tie.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{multitude}} of striking techniques exist {{that can be}} used effectively from the clinch. Punching, elbows in the clinch, also sometimes referred to as [...] "dirty boxing" [...] is an important aspect of Muay Thai, Lethwei and mixed martial arts. Elbows and short looping punches such as hooks and uppercuts can be used effectively from the single <b>collar</b> <b>tie</b> position. Although disallowed in many combat sports, in Lethwei, the use of headbutt is encouraged and can also be effectively used from the clinch. The short distance in the clinch nullifies kicking to some extent, but some kicks are still effective. In Muay Thai, the double <b>collar</b> <b>tie</b> is used to control an opponent while kneeing to the head or midsection, and stomps are used in some mixed martial arts competitions to kick the feet of the opponent.|$|E
50|$|There {{are very}} few {{submission}} holds {{that can be applied}} effectively from the clinch, without engaging in ground fighting. The most well known submission hold is the guillotine choke, which can be attempted from a single or double <b>collar</b> <b>tie.</b> Height is advantageous in applying the guillotine choke from the clinch, since sufficient leverage is needed.|$|E
25|$|Currently however, Sixth Form {{students}} {{are permitted to}} wear lounge suits or dark jackets, <b>collar</b> and <b>tie</b> with the option of jumpers if necessary.|$|R
50|$|The {{staircase}} is {{a reconstruction}} of the original and leads to an upstairs area which {{is divided into three}} rooms and a hallway. The hallway is lined with 300mm (approx) wide pine boards. The original shingle roof of the building survives under the corrugated iron. The external walls of the building project approximately one metre above the first floor level. Above these, plaster walls taper to meet a plaster ceiling both of which are divided by exposed timber rafters and <b>collar</b> <b>ties.</b>|$|R
60|$|Then he {{disengaged}} himself, {{adjusted his}} <b>collar</b> and <b>tie,</b> {{which had become}} rumpled, and unlocked the door. At once the head assistant strode into the dormitory.|$|R
5000|$|Tony La Brea, {{took off}} his robe and sang shirtless, wearing a <b>collar,</b> <b>tie</b> and cuffs. Before his performance, the judges noted that his voice {{was similar to that}} of Barry White. However, once he {{took off his}} shirt, the judges {{eventually}} got him X'd out. The song he sang was [...] "Don't Cha" [...] by The Pussycat Dolls.|$|E
50|$|The {{straight}} knee (also {{known as}} a front knee) is a typical knee strike, and involves thrusting {{the front of the}} knee into the head or body of an opponent. The straight knee can be applied from a stand-up position both when the combatants are separated, or when they are clinching. A particularly effective clinching position for throwing front knee is the double <b>collar</b> <b>tie,</b> where the head of the opponent is controlled. On the ground, front knees can be effective from a few top positions such as the Side control and north-south position. Typical targets for the front knee include the head, hips, ribs, solar plexus, stomach and thighs. In Muay Thai, a double <b>collar</b> <b>tie</b> with a front knee to the face was traditionally called Hak Kor Aiyara. The groin is widely considered the key target for knee strikes and clinch knee attacks in a street fight according to karate, tae kwon do, muay thai, and many other martial arts.|$|E
50|$|A knee strike (commonly {{referred}} to {{simply as a}} knee) is a strike with the knee, either with the kneecap or the surrounding area. The most common is the straight knee strike, often employed from a clinch or double <b>collar</b> <b>tie,</b> targeting anywhere from the groin to the head. Variants include the curved knee strike, {{which is similar to}} a roundhouse kick, and the jumping or flying knee.|$|E
50|$|A {{lavalier}} microphone or lavalier (also {{known as a}} lav, lapel mic, clip mic, body mic, collar mic, neck mic or personal mic) is a small microphone used for television, theatre, and public speaking applications {{in order to allow}} for hands-free operation. They are most commonly provided with small clips for attaching to <b>collars,</b> <b>ties,</b> or other clothing. The cord may be hidden by clothes and either run to a radio frequency transmitter kept in a pocket or clipped to a belt, or routed directly to the mixer or a recording device.|$|R
50|$|The {{west end}} of the chapel has a simple but {{attractive}} perpendicular window in the upper section with a door in the lower section. The original stone tracery of the window has been replaced with wood. Externally the sandstone has weathered badly. A small stone bell tower was once mounted above the western gable but was taken down before 1875. Internally the chapel has fine Gothic proportions. It has finely crafted timber trusses with <b>collar</b> <b>ties</b> and a timber ceiling above. The stonework has been painted and the ecclesiastical accoutrements removed.|$|R
5000|$|Eric Fenby {{is shown}} playing chess with his father, who is wearing an open-neck shirt. In fact, Fenby's father could not play chess and Eric {{never saw him}} without a <b>collar</b> and <b>tie.</b>|$|R
50|$|Although {{the exact}} date of {{his arrival in}} British Columbia is unknown, it is {{recorded}} that he was packing {{at the beginning of}} the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush in 1858 and continued until 1912, a span of 54 years. He wore the same type of clothing year round: a boiled white shirt, heavy woolen pants, riding boots and no socks. When he had business to conduct, he added a <b>collar,</b> <b>tie</b> and a French hat to his apparel.|$|E
50|$|A collar-and-elbow hold is a {{stand-up}} grappling position where both combatants have a <b>collar</b> <b>tie,</b> {{and hold the}} opponent's other arm at the elbow. Generally the opening move in professional wrestling, the collar-and-elbow is generally a neutral position, but by pushing the hand on the elbow {{to the inside of}} the opponent's arms, and holding the biceps, more control can be obtained. From here it will be easier to strike or to attempt takedowns, while defending against the opponent's techniques.|$|E
50|$|The verandahs {{are about}} 3.7m wide, with stop-chamfered posts, arched boarded valance, a {{handrail}} but no balustrade between the posts, and are unlined. The external walls have exposed timber framing, lined with 185 chamferboards. The Brown Street side wall has five casement windows, with 3-panes per sash and 2-pane toplights. The {{height of the}} sill of these windows alternates from floor level to sill level. Inside the hall, {{the walls and ceiling}} are lined with fibro sheet. The ceiling is raked up to the line of the <b>collar</b> <b>tie.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{retreated into}} the background. A man with flushed face, without <b>collar</b> or <b>tie,</b> clad in {{trousers}} and shirt only, had {{stepped out of}} the parlour. He stared at his visitors in embarrassment.|$|R
60|$|He {{pushed his}} <b>collar</b> and <b>tie</b> into his {{overcoat}} pocket. Then {{he sat down}} and pulled on his boots. They were sodden, as were his socks and trouser-bottoms. But he himself was quick and warm.|$|R
60|$|The {{boys were}} still minus their <b>collars</b> and <b>ties</b> when they {{suddenly}} realized that something unusual was taking place downstairs. They had closed the bedroom doors, but now all of them rushed out into the hallway.|$|R
