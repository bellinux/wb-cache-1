5|$|For certain {{physical}} scenarios, it {{is impossible}} to model forces as being due to gradient of potentials. This is often due to macrophysical <b>considerations</b> <b>that</b> yield forces as arising from a macroscopic statistical average of microstates. For example, friction is caused by the gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between the atoms, but manifests as a force model that is independent of any macroscale position vector. Nonconservative forces other than friction include other contact forces, tension, compression, and drag. However, for any sufficiently detailed description, all these forces are the results of conservative ones since each of these macroscopic forces are the net results of the gradients of microscopic potentials.|$|E
5|$|Virginia {{has some}} special <b>considerations</b> <b>that</b> affect {{tropical}} cyclone-related rainfall. Mountains {{to the west}} act as a perfect mechanism for upward motion during sustained east winds, {{which can lead to}} flash flooding and landslides in that region (e.g. Hurricane Camille). As a tropical system approaches from the south, a frontal zone sets up between the moist Atlantic Ocean and the drier landmass to the west. This boundary can set up two or three days in advance of a tropical storm, and can lead up to prolonged heavy rains across coastal sections (e.g. Hurricane Floyd). As the cyclone advances north, the boundary will slowly shift west, but progresses west of a Richmond/Washington, D.C. line.|$|E
25|$|As was {{indicated}} in the ex parte Fewings case, <b>considerations</b> <b>that</b> are relevant to a public authority's decision are of two kinds: there are mandatory relevant <b>considerations</b> (<b>that</b> is, <b>considerations</b> <b>that</b> the statute empowering the authority expressly or impliedly identifies as those that {{must be taken into}} account), and discretionary relevant considerations (those which the authority may take into account if it regards them as appropriate). Vasiliou v. Secretary of State for Transport (1991) {{is an example of a}} case in which a court found that a particular mandatory relevant consideration was to be implied into a statute. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that the Secretary of State for Transport had failed to take into account the fact that an order to close off a particular street for redevelopment would have caused the applicant a substantial loss of business.|$|E

25|$|If, in the {{exercise}} of its discretion on a public duty, an authority takes into account considerations which the courts consider not to be proper, then {{in the eyes of the}} law it has not exercised its discretion legally. On the other hand, <b>considerations</b> <b>that</b> are relevant to a public authority's decision are of two kinds: there are mandatory relevant <b>considerations</b> (<b>that</b> is, <b>considerations</b> <b>that</b> the statute empowering the authority expressly or impliedly identifies as those that must be taken into account), and discretionary relevant considerations (those which the authority may take into account if it regards them as appropriate). If a decision-maker has determined that a particular consideration is relevant to its decision, it is entitled to attribute to it whatever weight it thinks fit, and the courts will not interfere unless it has acted in a Wednesbury-unreasonable manner. This is consistent with the principle that the courts are generally only concerned with the legality of decisions and not their merits.|$|E

25|$|With new {{plans to}} open up the Auckland {{waterfront}} for more public access, the lack of sufficient cruise ship berthing space has entered the public discussion early 2008. This led to <b>considerations</b> <b>that</b> a new terminal could be built on the Western Reclamation. A major negative point for this usage would however be the short-term (from 2010 on) need for more cruise ship space, while the tank farm is unlikely to be redeveloped less than a decade in the future.|$|E
25|$|In many cases, this duty can be {{discharged}} by advising the client {{of the consequences}} in a forthright matter, and ensuring the client takes the engineer's advice. In very rare cases, where even a governmental authority may not take appropriate action, the engineer can only discharge the duty by making the situation public. As a result, whistleblowing by professional engineers is not an unusual event, and courts have often sided with engineers in such cases, overruling duties to employers and confidentiality <b>considerations</b> <b>that</b> otherwise would have prevented the engineer from speaking out.|$|E

25|$|A diesel–electric locomotive's {{power output}} is {{independent}} of road speed, {{as long as the}} unit's generator current and voltage limits are not exceeded. Therefore, the unit's ability to develop tractive effort (also referred to as drawbar pull or tractive force, which is what actually propels the train) will tend to inversely vary with speed within these limits. (See power curve below). Maintaining acceptable operating parameters was one of the principal design <b>considerations</b> <b>that</b> had to be solved in early diesel–electric locomotive development and, ultimately, led to the complex control systems in place on modern units.|$|E
25|$|As {{the project}} progressed, the professors' initial {{optimism}} {{gave way to}} pragmatic <b>considerations</b> <b>that</b> often left them frustrated and disillusioned. MSUG frequently found its well-intentioned advice either ignored outright, or co-opted in practice; in one example among many, Diệm used the Sûreté's national identification card registry {{to crack down on}} his dissenters. As a result, some professors returned home from their tours of duty and began to write articles critical of the Diệm regime and U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Two appeared in The New Republic magazine in 1961 and led to the end of MSUG.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the main}} <b>considerations</b> <b>that</b> led the Swedish {{government}} to declare Sweden a non-belligerent state was concern that they might otherwise lose control of the internal situation in Sweden. The Soviet demands on Finland in the {{months prior to the}} outbreak of war had roused public opinion. While there had been large demonstrations in support of Finland, Russia was a traditional enemy, and fear of the Russians had {{been a part of the}} Swedish mindset since 1719, when Russian galleys burned Swedish coastal communities during the Great Northern War. Therefore, there was a strong feeling that it was better to defend Sweden on Finnish soil.|$|E
25|$|Other {{relevant}} <b>considerations</b> <b>that</b> may {{mitigate the}} severity of the sentence include the conduct of the respondent, for example, whether he argued against culpability, expressed regret over his conduct, and made an apology for his contempt of court. Although the real risk test has no bearing on liability, the likelihood that the respondent's acts or statements pose a real risk of harm to the administration of justice may be relevant for mitigation or aggravation of the punishment. These considerations are non-exhaustive and the importance and relevance of these factors is dependent on the facts of each case, although guidance may be drawn from previous cases.|$|E
25|$|On {{their first}} tours, Fugazi worked out its DIY {{aesthetic}} {{by trial and}} error. The group's decisions were partly motivated by pragmatic <b>considerations</b> <b>that</b> were essentially a punk rock version of simple living: for example, selling merchandise on tour would require a full-time merchandise salesperson who would require lodging, food, and other costs, so Fugazi decided to simplify their touring by not selling merchandise. The band was also motivated by moral or ethical considerations: for example, Fugazi's members regarded pricey admission for rock concerts as tantamount to price gouging a performer's most loyal fans. Fugazi's inexpensive target goal of $5 admission was spawned during a conversation on an early tour when the band's members were debating the lowest profitable admission price.|$|E
