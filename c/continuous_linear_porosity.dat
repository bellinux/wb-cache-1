We also show that the following three propositions can be proved in classical mathematics, Brouwer's intuitionistic mathematics and constructive recursive mathematics of Markov's school, but cannot be in Bishop's framework: every sequentially <b>continuous</b> <b>linear</b> functional on E(R) is bounded on E(R); every bounded distribution with pseudobounded support is bounded on E(R); every sequentially <b>continuous</b> <b>linear</b> functional on E(R) is a distribution with compact support...|$|R

However, when n becomes large, it could be rather time-consuming. An improved numerical method for finding approximate solutions for (SP) is proposed to overcome the computational bottleneck.

40|$|<b>Continuous</b> <b>linear</b> {{programs}} have attracted considerable interest {{due to their}} potential for modelling manufacturing, scheduling and routing problems. While efficient simplex-type algorithms {{have been developed for}} separated <b>continuous</b> <b>linear</b> programs, crude time discretization remains the method of choice for solving general (non-separated) problem instances. In this paper we propose amoregenericapproximation scheme for non-separated <b>continuous</b> <b>linear</b> programs, where we approximate the functional decision variables (policies) by polynomial andpiecewisepolynomialdecision rules. This restriction results in an upper bound on the original problem, which can be computed efficiently by solving a tractable semidefinite program. Toestimate the approximation error, we also compute a lower bound by solving a dual <b>continuous</b> <b>linear</b> program in (piecewise) polynomial decision rules. We establishtheconvergence of the primal and dual approximations under Slater-type constraint qualifications. We also highlight the potential of our method for optimizing large-scale multiclass queueing systems and dynamic Leontief models...|$|R
50|$|A {{more precise}} {{version of the}} theorem quoted above {{requires}} specifying the class of functions on which the convolution is defined, and also requires assuming in addition that S must be a <b>continuous</b> <b>linear</b> operator {{with respect to the}} appropriate topology. It is known, for instance, that every continuous translation invariant <b>continuous</b> <b>linear</b> operator on L1 is the convolution with a finite Borel measure. More generally, every continuous translation invariant <b>continuous</b> <b>linear</b> operator on Lp for 1 ≤ p < ∞ is the convolution with a tempered distribution whose Fourier transform is bounded. To wit, they are all given by bounded Fourier multipliers.|$|R
