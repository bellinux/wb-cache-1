2500|$|While the Clinton {{campaign}} chose {{a strategy}} that emphasized experience, Axelrod helped to craft the Obama campaign's main theme of [...] "change." [...] Axelrod criticized the Clinton campaign's positioning by saying that [...] "being the consummate Washington insider is not {{where you want to}} be in a year when people want change... initial strategic positioning was wrong and kind of played into our hands." [...] The change message played a factor in Obama's victory in the Iowa caucuses. [...] "Just over half of [...] Democratic caucus-goers said change was the No. 1 factor they were looking for in a candidate, and 51 percent of those voters chose Barack Obama," [...] said <b>CNN</b> <b>senior</b> political analyst Bill Schneider. [...] "That compares to only 19 percent of 'change' caucus-goers who preferred Clinton." [...] Axelrod also believed that the Clinton campaign underestimated the importance of the caucus states. [...] "For all the talent and the money they had over there," [...] says Axelrod, [...] "they—bewilderingly—seemed to have little understanding for the caucuses and how important they would become." [...] In the 2008 primary season, Obama won a majority of the states that use the caucus format.|$|E
