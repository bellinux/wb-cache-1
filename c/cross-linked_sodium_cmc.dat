This is in agreement with the large size of these swollen particles. Suspensions of such swollen gel particles are thus a good model for extremely high molecular weight polymer solutions.

This approach simply optimizes and reconstructs the porous channel structure of the carrier matrix, namely, poloxamer 407 (P 407) -based hydrogel matrix blended with carboxymethyl cellulose <b>sodium</b> (<b>CMCs).</b> Addition of CMCs was found to distinctly improve the porous structure of the P 407 matrix. The pore size approximated to normal distribution as CMCs were added and the fraction of pore number was increased by over tenfold. Transdermal studies showed that P 407 /CMCs saw {{a significant increase in}} drug permeability across the skin. This suggests that P 407 /CMC with improved porous structure exhibits a feasible and promising way for the development of transdermal therapy with high permeability and bioavailability, thereby avoiding or reducing use of any chemical enhancers...|$|R
40|$|Naltrexone {{hydrochloride}} (NTX) is {{an innovative}} drug used in ophthalmology {{for treatment of}} ocular surface diseases such as impaired corneal wound healing and severe dry eye. Poor chemical stability {{has been a major}} limitation for development of NTX in solution form. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop and characterise NTX in situ ocular films for enhanced chemical stability and improved ocular tolerability. The films were prepared from different amorphous polymers and characterised for physicochemical compatibility, moisture-sorption, surface pH, mechanical properties, sterilisability, surface morphology, mucoadhesion, in vitro release, conjunctival irritation and accelerated stability at 40 °C/ 75 % relative humidity for 3 months. Glycerin (GLY) -plasticised films exhibited significantly better mechanical properties, compared with polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400 and triethylcitrate (TEC) -plasticised formulations. Superior mucoadhesion was recorded for F 7 and F 9 plasticised with GLY and PEG 400, respectively. The stability of NTX was significantly enhanced more than 18 -times, compared with the solution form. Combination of carboxymethylcellulose <b>sodium</b> (<b>CMC)</b> and <b>sodium</b> alginate (ALG) in a film formulation demonstrated minimal % moisture sorption, good mechanical properties, in vitro release, excellent chemical stability and minimal conjunctival irritation lending them as promising ocular formulations...|$|R
40|$|Metformin {{hydrochloride}} is a hypoglycemic agent {{used for}} the treatment of non-insulin dependent Diabetes mellitus. It is a BCS class III drug having high solubility and poor permeability. Plasma half life ranges from 1. 5 to 3 hours and oral bioavailability is 50 to 60 %. Hence require frequent oral administration for adequate treatment of Diabetes. In order to extend the gastric retention time, oral sustained release dosage form was develop in the form of microspheres using different polymers (<b>sodium</b> <b>CMC,</b> HPMC K 100 M). All the formulations were evaluated for in-vitro dissolution, entrapment efficiency, and percentage buoyancy. Metformin hydrochloride microspheres of formulation F- 4 was optimized on the basis of in-vitro drug release pattern, entrapment efficiency, percentage buoyancy. The percentage yield of optimized formulation was 72 %, entrapment efficiency was 70. 56 %, percentage buoyancy was 86 % and the cumulative percentage drug release after 11 hours was found to be 90 %. The optimized formulation was tested for its stability for 6 months as per ICH guidelines and the formulation found tom be stable during the test period.

40|$|Abstract The {{present study}} was aimed to {{formulate}} the solid dispersion incorporated microcapsule to improve the dissolution rate and half life of pioglitazone hydrochloride. The solvent evaporation method was used to formulate the solid dispersion resulted increased dissolution rate, bioavailability and stability. Finally increase the half life of the drug by employ the orifice ionic gelation method to formulate solid dispersion incorporated muco-adhesive microcapsule. The solubility of pioglitazone hydrochloride was increase by the preparation of its solid dispersion with polyvinyl pyrrolidone K 30 using solvent evaporation methods. The microcapsules of pioglitazone hydrochloride were prepared by (orifice ionic gelation method) employing sodium alginate as a cell forming polymer and using a different bio-adhesive polymers as carbopol, HPMC and <b>sodium</b> <b>CMC</b> in a various ratios of 1 : 1, 3 : 1, 6 : 1 & 9 : 1, by orifice ion gelation method. FT-IR spectra revealed no chemical incompatibility between drug and polymers. Drug-polymer interactions were investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Powder X-Ray Diffraction (PXRD). Scanning electron microscope photographs of samples revealed that all prepared microcapsules were almost spherical in shape and have a slightly smooth surface...|$|R
