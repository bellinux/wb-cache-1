The stress-strain behavior of materials is not strictly linear even below the yield point, hence the modulus of elasticity decreases as stress increases, and significantly so as the stresses approach the material's yield strength. This reduced material rigidity reduces the buckling strength of the structure and results in a bucking load less than that predicted by the assumption of linear elastic behavior.|$|E

In this study, the makeup, sealability and joint strength was analyzed from conditions of make-up <b>loading,</b> tension <b>loading,</b> <b>compression</b> <b>loading</b> and internal pressure loading by finite element method. The makeup torque, the contact pressure distributions of metal seal along the axis and the stress distributions of threaded connection are given. The results show that under tension <b>loading,</b> <b>compression</b> <b>loading</b> and internal pressure, the overall stress level of threaded connection is lower than of pipe. The anti-compression performance and joint strength of threaded connection is greater than of pipe. The contact pressures of metal seal maintain relatively high level of contact pressures under tension <b>loading,</b> <b>compression</b> <b>loading</b> and internal pressure.

To analyze the rheology, the stress was restricted to uniaxial compression in the longitudinal direction and the post-linear behavior was analyzed using plasticity theory.

40|$|Carbody {{compression}} resistance {{is a major}} LRV safety feature in head-on collisions. Regrettably, one of the difficulties in writing LRV specifications has been establishing credible values for the design <b>compression</b> <b>loads</b> that the carbody shall demonstrate to resist. One reason for this difficulty is that setting <b>compression</b> <b>loads</b> involves judgment and therefore is to a great degree subjective. The other is that vehicle engineers have been setting design <b>compression</b> <b>loads</b> in relative isolation from each other, {{without the benefit of}} a broader discussion among them. This paper will attempt to reconcile the various positions and, based on statistical data, will recommend median values for <b>compression</b> <b>loads</b> as a function of carset kinetic energy. This paper concerns establishing LRV design compression (buffload) values, the work done for the ASME RT 1 (LRV Structural Safety Standard) Committee. The starting assumptions have been as follows: 1. Build the investigation on as broad a statistical database as possible. 2. Analyze the issue of buffloads using the Cartesian system of coordinates, with buffloads on the vertical (Y) axis, and the kinetic energies of vehicle carsets on the horizontal (X) axis. 3. Follow a self-evident premise that smaller and slower passenger carsets have lower energies and buffloads, while bigger and faster ones have higher energies and buffloads. 4.

The paper goes on to observe that under NASA's SSP program (Space Solar Power Truss), a 24-foot long inflatable-rigidizable truss using polyurethane composites withstood a <b>compression</b> <b>load</b> of 556 pounds, 10% above its designed compression strength while reducing mass of comparable mechanical structures by a factor of 4.It had been long theorized that solar sails could reflect photons streaming from the sun and convert some of the energy into thrust.

In 2003, LGarde, together with partners JPL, Ball Aerospace, and Langley Research Center, under the direction of NASA, developed a solar sail configuration that utilized inflatable rigidized boom components to achieve 10,000 m2 sailcraft with a real density of 14.1 g/m2 and potential acceleration of 0.58 mm/s2. The entire configuration released by the upper stage has a mass of 232.9 kg and required just 1.7 m3 of volume in the booster.
