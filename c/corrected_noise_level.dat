Kennison, Peter Ivory, Senqi HuAudibility, Degradation, Intelligibility, Masker, Presentation Level, Word PositionThe {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{contribution}} of individual words of a sentence to its overall intelligibility. The stimulus sentences used in this study were composed of seven to nine syllables, and contained three target words, all monosyllabic and of CNC format. The stimulus sentences were selected from the Veteran Administration Sentence Test (VAST) that was developed to control indexical, lexical, and sentence-to-sentence perceptual variability. The dependent variable was the number of target words in each sentence correctly identified. The question of interest was how the degradation of the audibility of the initial word would affect the other target words. Other variables in the design included presentation levels that resulted in overall performance from 50 to 100 percent <b>correct.</b> <b>Noise</b> <b>levels</b> were fixed at 60 dB, and speech levels were varied to 57 dB (- 3 dB), 54 dB (- 6 dB), and 51 dB (- 9 dB) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate the accuracy and adequacy of current airframe noise prediction methods using available airframe noise measurements from tests of a narrow body transport (DC- 9) and a wide body transport (DC- 10) in addition to scale model test data. General features of the airframe noise from these aircraft and models are outlined. The results of the assessment of two airframe prediction methods, Fink's and Munson's methods, against flight test data of these aircraft and scale model wind tunnel test data are presented. These methods were extensively evaluated against measured data from several configurations including clean, slat deployed, landing gear-deployed, flap deployed, and landing configurations of both DC- 9 and DC- 10.

A description of the two ground tests including detailed propulsion, noise, and structural test results is presented. The primary objectives of the total test program were comparison of JT 8 D- 15 and JT 8 D- 115 overall propulsion system performance and noise characteristics and determination of incremental component <b>noise</b> <b>levels.</b> Other objectives of the test program included: (1) determination of acoustic treatment effectiveness; (2) measurement of internal sound pressure levels; (3) measurement of inlet and exhaust hardware performance; (4) determination of center-engine surge margin; and (5) evaluation of certain structural characteristics associated with the 727 refan center-engine inlet duct and JT 8 D refan engine exhaust system. The JT 8 D- 15 and - 115 tests were conducted during September 1974 and January to March 1975, respectively.

40|$|Abstract. We have {{combined}} four {{different types of}} functional genomic data to create high coverage protein interaction networks for 11 microbes. Our integration algorithm naturally handles statistically dependent predictors and automatically <b>corrects</b> for differing <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> and data corruption in different evidence sources. We find {{that many of the}} predictions in each integrated network hinge on moderate but consistent evidence from multiple sources rather than strong evidence from a single source, yielding novel biology which would be missed if a single data source such as coexpression or coinheritance was used in isolation. In addition to statistical analysis, we demonstrate via case study that these subtle interactions can discover new aspects of even well studied functional modules. Our work represents the largest collection of probabilistic protein interaction networks compiled to date, and our methods can be applied to any sequenced organism and any kind of experimental or computational technique which produces pairwise measures of protein interaction. ...|$|R
40|$|The aeroacoustic {{performance}} of several generic nozzle geometries was tested {{to evaluate the}} potential benefits of using non-round jet exit geometries to reduce noise from combat military aircraft. Both the aerodynamics and far field acoustics of several M(sub d) = 1. 5 and 2. 0 round, elliptic, and rectangular nozzles, including an augmented deflector exhaust nozzle (ADEN), were studied to assess noise emission. The nozzles were operated to jet total temperatures, T(sub 0) = 1160 degree R, and the data scaled to constant thrust. The data were propagated to 1500 ft. and <b>corrected</b> to perceived <b>noise</b> <b>level.</b> The aerodynamic results of the study show that the non-round nozzle geometries mix much faster with the surrounding medium than does an equivalent round nozzle plume. Both the ADEN and elliptic nozzles provide significant reduction of noise, 6 to 7 PNdB, along the major axis direction with little expected impact on nozzle performance. Shock noise processes are eliminated for elliptic nozzles, but are still significant with rectangular nozzles. Comparison of measurements to theoretical predictions of noise using the quasi-linear instability wave model demonstrates good qualitative agreement...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} new Bayesian method for {{estimating}} white <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> in CMB sky maps, and apply this algorithm to the 5 -year WMAP data. We assume that the amplitude of the noise RMS is scaled by a constant value, alpha, relative to a pre-specified <b>noise</b> <b>level.</b> We then derive the corresponding conditional density, P(alpha | s, Cl, d), which is subsequently integrated into a general CMB Gibbs sampler. We first verify our code by analyzing simulated data sets, and then apply the framework to the WMAP data. For the foreground-reduced 5 -year WMAP sky maps and the nominal <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> initially provided in the 5 -year data release, {{we find that the}} posterior means typically range between alpha= 1. 005 +- 0. 001 and alpha= 1. 010 +- 0. 001 depending on differencing assembly, indicating that the <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> of these maps are biased low by 0. 5 - 1. 0 %. The same problem is not observed for the uncorrected WMAP sky maps. After the preprint version of this letter appeared on astro-ph., the WMAP team has corrected the values presented on their web page, noting that the initially provided values were in fact estimates from the 3 -year data release, not from the 5 -year estimates. However, internally in their 5 -year analysis the <b>correct</b> <b>noise</b> values were used, and no cosmological results are therefore compromised by this error.

In this paper, we discuss an enhanced version of a convolutional-like decoding paradigm which adopts very large spaces of possible system states, {{of the order of}} 264. Under such conditions, the traditional convolution operation is rendered useless and needs {{to be replaced by a}} carefully designed state transition procedure. The size of the system state space completely changes the correction philosophy, as state collisions are virtually impossible and the decoding procedure becomes a correction tree. The proposed decoding algorithm is practically cost-free for low channel noise. As the channel noise approaches the Shannon limit, it is still possible to perform correction, although its cost increases to infinity. In many applications, the implemented decoder can essentially outperform both LDPC and TC. This paper describes the proposed correction paradigm and theoretically analyzes the asymptotic correction performance. The considered encoder and decoder were verified experimentally for the binary symmetric channel. The correction process remains practically cost-free for channel error rates below 0. 05 and 0. 13 for the 1 / 2 and 1 / 4 rate codes, respectively.

40|$|Valuation {{of traffic}} noise {{abatement}} based on hedonic pricing {{models of the}} property market has traditionally measured the noise as the equivalent, or another average, level. What is not captured in such a noise indicator is the maximum <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> of a vehicle passage. In this study, we incorporate the maximum <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> in the hedonic model letting the property price depend on both the equivalent <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> and the maximum <b>noise</b> <b>level.</b> Hedonic models for both rail and road noise are estimated. Data consists of characteristics of sold properties, property-specific noise calculation, and geographical variables. We use the hedonic approach to estimate the marginal willingness to pay (WTP) for maximum noise abatement where we model the effect as the maximum <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> subtracted with the equivalent <b>noise</b> <b>level.</b> Furthermore, we control for the equivalent <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> in the estimations. The estimated results show that including the maximum <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> in the model has influence on the property prices, but only for rail and not for road. This means that for road we cannot reject the hypothesis that WTP for noise abatement {{is based on the}} equivalent <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> only. For rail, on the other hand, we estimate the marginal WTP for the maximum <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> and {{it turns out to be}} substantial.

This article presents an exemplary assessment of the audible and infrasonic <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> in the cabins of selected modern wheeled {{agricultural tractor}}s. Materials and Methods: Operator-perceived audible and infrasonic <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> in the cabins were examined for 20 types of modern tractors during typical conditions of work. The tractors had been in use for no longer than 3 years, with rated power between 96 kW and 227 kW, designed and produced by world-renowned companies. <b>Noise</b> <b>level</b> measurements were performed in accordance with PN-EN ISO 9612 : 2011 (ISO 9612 : 2009). Results: Audible <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> (A-weighted) ranged from 62. 1 to 87. 4 dB-A (average: 68. 2 to 83. 8 dB-A) for different work tasks. The factors influencing <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> include performed tasks, soil, weather conditions and the skills of individual drivers. In spectrum analysis, the highest <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> occurred at frequencies 250 Hz, 1 and 2 kHz. Infrasound <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> (G-weighted) ranged from 87. 3 to 111. 3 dB-G. The driver-experienced exposure to infrasound was found to increase significantly when the vehicle was in motion. Conclusions: Average audible <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> have no potential to adversely affect the hearing organ during tasks performed inside the closed cabins of the analysed modern agricultural tractors. Due to the relatively low audible <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> inside the cabins of modern agricultural tractors, non-auditory effects are the only adverse symptoms that can develop. Modern agricultural tractors emit considerable infrasonic <b>noise</b> <b>levels.</b> All tractors introduced into the market should be subjected to tests with regard to infrasonic <b>noise</b> <b>levels...</b>|$|R

40|$|Governments {{all over}} the world have enacted {{environmental}} noise directives and noise control ordinances/acts to protect tranquility in residential areas. However, {{there is a lack of}} literature on the evaluation of whether the Acceptable <b>Noise</b> <b>Levels</b> (ANLs) stipulated in the directive/ordinance/act are actually achievable. The study aimed at measuring outdoor environmental <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> in Hong Kong and identifying whether the measured <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> are lower than the stipulated ANLs at 20 categories of residential areas. Data were gathered from a territory-wide noise survey. Outdoor noise measurements were conducted at 203 residential premises in urban areas, low-density residential areas, rural areas, and other areas. In total, 366 daytime hourly Leq outdoor <b>noise</b> <b>levels,</b> 362 nighttime hourly Leq outdoor <b>noise</b> <b>levels,</b> and 20 sets of daily, that is, 24 Leq, 1 -h outdoor <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> were recorded. The mean daytime Leq, 1 -h values ranged 54. 4 - 70. 8 dBA, while the mean nighttime Leq, 1 -h values ranged 52. 6 - 67. 9 dBA. When the measured <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> were compared with the stipulated ANLs, only three out of the 20 categories of areas had outdoor <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> below ANLs during daytime. All other areas (and all areas during nighttime) were found to have outdoor <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> at or above ANLs. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focus on}} noise {{evaluation}} done at LRT Kelana Jaya Line during train operation. The {{aim of this}} study was to estimate the <b>level</b> of <b>noise</b> during train operation and evaluate the actual <b>level</b> of <b>noise</b> measurement at selected LRT stations. After that, a concept to reduce <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> during train operation was proposed. In addition, the actual <b>level</b> of <b>noise</b> measurement was compared with the theoretical permissible noise based on existing predetermined guidelines and standards. For train interior <b>noise</b> <b>level,</b> sound level meter was installed at front end and gangway by following noise measurement procedure provided by standards and guidelines. For noise at train stations, <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> recorded at different distance from trackside which is 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 meters. The results show that for train interior <b>noise</b> <b>level,</b> most of the time of train operation was exceeded the limitation provided by Prasarana based on standard ISO 3381, 75 dB. The <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> also exceeded <b>noise</b> limit in tunnel which is 80 dB during train operation. For station <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> data, only at distance 2 meter and 4 meter from track can achieve <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> more than 5 dB than limits provided by DOE, about 80 dB. In conclusion, interior train <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> may need to be decrease and at Setiawangsa station has the highest <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> than other stations...|$|R
40|$|The {{measurement}} of <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> at high-traffic intersections of Gusau town is {{reported in this}} work. Five high-traffic locations tagged LOC-A, LOC-B, LOC-C, LOC-D and LOC-E were selected and evaluated at different periods of the day using an MS 6700 IEC 651, ANSI. Si. 4 Type- 2 Sound Level meter. Result analyses indicates that LOC-C has the highest <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> with LNP = 95 and TNI = 94, while LOC-B has the lowest <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> with LNP = 82 and TNI = 67. These <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> imply that Gusau metropolis has an unacceptable <b>noise</b> <b>level,</b> well above the globally recommended levels of 60 - 65 dB(A) and the national recommended level of 82 dB(A). The paper therefore makes recommendations on minimizing these intolerable <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> with consequences for environmental and human health in the study location...|$|R
