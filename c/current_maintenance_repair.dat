The paper begins {{with a discussion of}} reliability methodology and its vital contributions to failure made analysis. A review of general maintenance, repair and replacement models is then undertaken as a guide to potential adaptation to and/or development of such analyses for marine diesel engines.

40|$|Purpose. The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to {{substantiate}} the necessity of period adjustment and volumes of <b>maintenance,</b> <b>current</b> <b>repairs</b> of locomotive approaching and regulatory exceeded of their useful operational time. Methodology. In connection with the physical and moral depreciation of rolling stock in modern conditions the most important area to ensure the effectiveness of rail transport in the foreseeable future is the rational use of the rolling stock in operation within the designated and extended service life. At the same time extending the operational time of the locomotives must be achieved by compliance with the optimum ratio of measures to adjust the timing and technology <b>maintenance,</b> <b>current</b> <b>repairs</b> and preparation of repair base. The paper presents the components of dependency forming work amount on <b>maintenance,</b> <b>current</b> <b>repairs</b> with time operation. By the modeling of its changes a graph that implement adjusted system to the content of the rolling stock traction after operation were constructed. The study found that the dynamics of change processes of necessary expenses for <b>maintenance</b> and <b>current</b> <b>repair</b> increases. It is shown that under aging conditions of locomotive fleet and repair base of locomotive economy, a situation that is a critical for the railway transport of Ukraine has appeared. According to it, to the end of operation the amount of work relative to the recommended rules of repair increases slightly. When the locomotive is new or renovated, deviations from the standard path for rigid observance of repair requirements (the compliance with technical standards) does not exceed the norm. However, when the standard period is exhausted, to comply with these standards is not possible. From the data it was found that the greater the amount of <b>maintenance,</b> routine <b>repair</b> in the repair cycle, the more effort you need to put in a multiplicity of software runs between scheduled of <b>maintenance,</b> <b>current</b> <b>repairs.</b> It is advisable to conduct more repair work to ensure lower costs for the maintenance of locomotives. Findings. The values for the effective maintenance of traction rolling stock for a variety of tactics to support them were obtained. Originality. Theoretically the need to adjust the timing and technology <b>maintenance</b> and <b>current</b> <b>repair</b> of traction rolling stock in the operation of locomotives, over normative was demonstrated. Practical value. Obtained results allow increasing the efficient use of traction rolling stock with effectively cost...|$|R

50|$|During the World War II, {{the road}} was badly damaged. During the battles and the liberation of the {{territory}} from invaders, railroad workers carried out the supply to frontlines, the transport service, the restoration path and rolling stock. Thousands of railway workers participated in combat operations, worked in the underground. In the postwar years in the Cisdnieper railway Trade Union was not only restored, but also constructed, reconstructed, new stations, railway stations, artificial structures, including major bridges across the Dnieper. The main meridional direction Lozova — Zaporozhia transferred to electric traction; electrified main latitudinal direction and suburban areas. Electric traction is 77% of the total turnover, the rest is diesel. Up to 85% of the road sections equipped with automatic lock, up to 95% — electric interlocking of switches and signals. Built large marshalling yards, equipped with modern technical means of mechanization and automation. On loading and unloading operations are applied mechanization. High-performance track machines are used for <b>current</b> <b>maintenance</b> and <b>repairs.</b>|$|R

Strategy development is dependent upon a solid, current and complete industrial analysis. An industrial analysis includes, 1) a definition of the industry, 2) a description of external forces acting upon the industry, 3) a description of the industry structure and 4) an examination of the key success factors that benchmark the requirements for a firm to stay competitive in the industry. These analyses provide FRCSW with the information required to leverage their core competencies to indentify and capitalize on potential opportunities in the industry. This study identifies emerging trends, presents projected forecasts, identifies external forces on both the military aviation MRO industry and FRCSW, and discusses those factors that are key to long term success in the military aviation MRO industry. The conclusions present a number of opportunities for FRCSW to explore in their effort to remain the Navy's premier aviation depot...|$|R
40|$|Within Real Property Portfolio Management. {{there is}} a {{conscious}} search for new methodologies to improve building management practice, particularly for facilities in use. An approach in this direction is realized by the application of Statistical Quality Control (SQC), a technique used for monitoring quality in industrial products. This thesis presents a framework for performance control of real property portfolio, {{based on the principle}} and practice of SQC. The model has three primary constituents: information, techniques and rules. The model uses data generated from building operations activity of <b>maintenance</b> and <b>repair.</b> The usage of non-monetary information to assess performance of buildings {{is one of the key}} features of this model. User generated information, such as complaints, originating from various sources within the portfolio, are used as indicators of performance. Two groups of statistical techniques are used in the model; the first uses historic operations data for designing management priorities in the building inventory, and the second utilizes data generated from <b>current</b> <b>maintenance</b> and <b>repair</b> activities. The rules determine the practice at different levels of the organization, with particular illustration for operations level. To understand various organizational issues brought forth by the model from the point of view of an existing facilities management organization, a case study is undertaken of the Physical Plant Department (PPD) at MIT. PPD governs the operations of MIT's academic portfolio; it is primarily engaged in providing day-to-day building services to the MIT community. The model is then tested for performance control of the roofing sub-system by utilizing the operations information collected by Physical Plant Department from 1980 through 1988. The implications of assessing building performance in "statistical terms" are enormous. This thesis is aimed at understanding various organizational pre-conditions that apply for accepting the SQC model in order to improve building management practice. by Jyoti Deolalikar. Thesis (M.

But {{it was decided}} that the ship was put into operation on 1 October 1949. In October, The steamer commenced maiden voyage after repair and was carrying cargo for fishermen. Most of the crewmembers were newcomers and came out at sea for the first time. On the first day the ship entered the gale which did not stop for a few days. The waves flooded the deck, parted the tackle, but the people did not leave their posts. Steering gear was damaged during the storm. The team repaired it immediately and underway. Also other deffects of other mechanisms were mended underway. When the northern areas received supply, the ship went to Ossorsk and Ukinsk combines, where they met a heavy solid ice. Successfully overcoming it, the ship arrived at the scheduled points timely. The annual plan of 1949 year was completed by this voyage anticipatorily. The best crew members received commendation due to excellent voyage management.|$|R
