5|$|Clindamycin may {{prolong the}} effects of neuromuscular-blocking drugs, such as succinylcholine and vecuronium. Its {{similarity}} to the mechanism of action of macrolides and <b>chloramphenicol</b> means {{they should not be}} given simultaneously, as this causes antagonism and possible cross-resistance.|$|E
5|$|It does so by {{preventing}} {{the formation of}} the initiation complex, composed of the 30S and 50S subunits of the ribosome, tRNA, and mRNA. Linezolid binds to the 23S portion of the 50S subunit (the center of peptidyl transferase activity), close to the binding sites of <b>chloramphenicol,</b> lincomycin, and other antibiotics. Due to this unique mechanism of action, cross-resistance between linezolid and other protein synthesis inhibitors is highly infrequent or nonexistent.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial infections may {{be treated}} with antibiotics, which are {{classified}} as bacteriocidal if they kill bacteria, or bacteriostatic if they just prevent bacterial growth. There are many types of antibiotics and each class inhibits {{a process that is}} different in the pathogen from that found in the host. An example of how antibiotics produce selective toxicity are <b>chloramphenicol</b> and puromycin, which inhibit the bacterial ribosome, but not the structurally different eukaryotic ribosome. Antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in intensive farming to promote animal growth, where they may be contributing to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations. Infections can be prevented by antiseptic measures such as sterilising the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a syringe, and by proper care of indwelling catheters. Surgical and dental instruments are also sterilised to prevent contamination by bacteria. Disinfectants such as bleach are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and further reduce the risk of infection.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from its}} use in water treatment, the other major {{application}} of KMnO4 is as a reagent for the synthesis of organic compounds. Significant amounts are required for the synthesis of ascorbic acid, <b>chloramphenicol,</b> saccharin, isonicotinic acid, and pyrazinoic acid.|$|E
25|$|Sodium {{borohydride}} reduces aldehydes and ketones to {{give the}} related alcohols. This reaction {{is used in the}} production of various antibiotics including <b>chloramphenicol,</b> dihydrostreptomycin, and thiophenicol. Various steroids and vitamin A are prepared using sodium borohydride in at least one step.|$|E
25|$|If {{diagnosed}} {{in time the}} various forms of plague are usually highly responsive to antibiotic therapy. The antibiotics often used are streptomycin, <b>chloramphenicol</b> and tetracycline. Amongst the newer generation of antibiotics, gentamicin and doxycycline have proven effective in monotherapeutic treatment of plague.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{antibiotics}} act by inhibiting translation. These include anisomycin, cycloheximide, <b>chloramphenicol,</b> tetracycline, streptomycin, erythromycin, and puromycin. Prokaryotic ribosomes {{have a different}} structure from that of eukaryotic ribosomes, and thus antibiotics can specifically target bacterial infections without any harm to a eukaryotic host's cells.|$|E
25|$|Doxycycline is {{typically}} used first line, although some strains of V. cholerae have shown resistance. Testing for resistance during an outbreak can help determine appropriate future choices. Other antibiotics {{proven to be}} effective include cotrimoxazole, erythromycin, tetracycline, <b>chloramphenicol,</b> and furazolidone. Fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin, also may be used, but resistance has been reported.|$|E
25|$|H. larsenii is {{resistant}} to the following antibiotics: ampicillin, <b>chloramphenicol,</b> erythromycin, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, neomycin, penicillin G, rifampicin, streptomycin, and tetracycline. The organism is sensitive to bacitracin and novobiocin. Antibiotic sensitivity and resistance was determined using the agar diffusion test in which paper discs saturated with antibiotics were placed on agar plates.|$|E
25|$|The {{infection}} is treated with antibiotics. Intravenous fluids and oxygen {{may be needed}} to stabilize the patient. There is a significant disparity between the untreated mortality and treated mortality rates: 10-60% untreated versus close to 0% treated with antibiotics within 8 days of initial infection. Tetracycline, <b>Chloramphenicol,</b> and doxycycline are commonly used. Infection can also be prevented by vaccination.|$|E
25|$|In photoinhibition studies, repair {{is often}} stopped by {{applying}} an antibiotic (lincomycin or <b>chloramphenicol)</b> to plants or cyanobacteria, which blocks protein synthesis in the chloroplast. Protein synthesis occurs only in an intact sample, so lincomycin {{is not needed}} when photoinhibition is measured from isolated membranes. The repair cycle of PSII recirculates other subunits of PSII (except for the D1 protein) from the inhibited unit to the repaired one.|$|E
25|$|To {{ensure the}} pCas9cr4 plasmid was first {{successfully}} {{admitted to the}} cells, the cells were grown on a plate containing chloramphenicol; the pCas9cr4 plasmid contained the gene cmr, conferring resistance to <b>chloramphenicol,</b> which ensured only the successful recombinants grew. Triplicate plates of 10μL of recovered cultures as well as dilutions of 10−1, 10−2, and 10−3 were then spotted and incubated overnight at 30°C and CFU, or colony forming unit, assessments were then made to identify successful mutants using the miniaturized plating method described previously. Once the mutation of interest was screened using overnight growth on M9 minimal medium plates supplemented with glycerol, chloroacetate and SOC (super optimal broth with catabolite repression), colonies were patched onto selective plates using a toothpick and incubated at 30°C for two nights. After sufficient colony growth, cells were transfected with the pKDsg-XXX plasmid containing the aada gene, {{and as a result}} were resistant to the aminoglycosides spectinomycin and streptomycin. To ensure that the pKDsg-XXX plasmid was successfully admitted to the cells, the cells were grown on a plate containing both <b>chloramphenicol</b> and spectinomycin to select for cells containing both the pCas9cr4 and pKDsg-XXX plasmids.|$|E
25|$|Myelodysplasia is a {{diagnosis}} of exclusion and must be made after proper determination of iron stores, vitamin deficiencies, and nutrient deficiencies are ruled out. Also, congenital diseases such as congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA I through IV) have been recognized, Pearson's syndrome (sideroblastic anemia), Jordans anomaly - vacuolization in all cell lines {{may be seen in}} Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome, aminolevulinic acid enzyme deficiency, and other more esoteric enzyme deficiencies are known to give a pseudomyelodysplastic picture in one of the cell lines; however, all three cell lines are never morphologically dysplastic in these entities with the exception of <b>chloramphenicol,</b> arsenic toxicity, and other poisons.|$|E
25|$|The first plasmid {{used in the}} {{pioneering}} work of Reisch and Prather is composed of: the cas9 gene {{under the control of}} the PTET promoter; the tetR gene, which codes for tetracycline repressor protein, under control of a constitutive promoter; and the cmr gene for <b>chloramphenicol</b> resistance. It was observed that leaky expression of Cas9 occurred even without induction of the PTET promoter. Therefore, to avoid cell death, a transfer messenger RNA (ssrA) tag was included in the plasmid downstream of the cas9 gene. In the event of leaky Cas9 expression, the C-terminal ssrA tag would be recognized by ClpP protease and degrade Cas9 to allow for better expressional control of the protein. Together, these components make up the pCas9cr4 plasmid and allow targeting of the host cell chromosome.|$|E
25|$|Its use is advised {{against in}} people on strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as clarithromycin, <b>chloramphenicol,</b> ketoconazole, {{ritonavir}} and nefazodone {{due to its}} reliance on CYP3A4 for metabolism. Likewise it is a CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 inhibitor and hence concurrent treatment with substrates {{of any of these}} enzymes may increase plasma concentrations of said drugs. Since imatinib is mainly metabolised via the liver enzyme CYP3A4, substances influencing the activity of this enzyme change the plasma concentration of the drug. An example of a drug that increases imatinib activity and therefore side effects by blocking CYP3A4 is ketoconazole. The same could be true of itraconazole, clarithromycin, grapefruit juice, among others. Conversely, CYP3A4 inductors like rifampicin and St. John's Wort reduce the drug's activity, risking therapy failure. Imatinib also acts as an inhibitor of CYP3A4, 2C9 and 2D6, increasing the plasma concentrations of a number of other drugs like simvastatin, ciclosporin, pimozide, warfarin, metoprolol, and possibly paracetamol. The drug also reduces plasma levels of levothyroxin via an unknown mechanism.|$|E
25|$|Following {{successful}} recombination of {{the linear}} DNA {{to the target}} genome, plasmid origins and markers can be re-used {{as a result of}} the plasmid curing method. The pKDsgRNA contains a temperature sensitive open reading frame which, when grown at 37oC, denatures the plasmid. This allows for easy plasmid curing that does not include any additional reagents. This is useful because upon curing of the pKDsg-XXX plasmid, another pKDsg-XXX plasmid with a different sgRNA can subsequently be transfected into the E. coli cells to introduce further mutations to the target cellular sequences. After all mutations are introduced, both plasmids should be cured. Unfortunately, the pCas9cr4 plasmid lacks an inherent curing mechanism, so Reisch and Prather pioneered a plasmid curing mechanism by introducing a pKDsgRNA whose sgRNA is complement to the pCas9cr4 plasmid. Specifically, they constructed a pKDsg-p15A which targeted the p15A origin of replication of the pCas9cr4 plasmid. After recombinants were selected for, expression of Cas9 and sgRNA was induced with the addition of aTc. After plating on selective plates and growing at 37oC, they observed no colony formation on the LB plates containing <b>chloramphenicol</b> indicating loss of the pCas9cr4 plasmid due to a Cas9-mediated double strand break in the plasmid. Additional plasmid mini-preps demonstrated that neither plasmid was retained in the cells, therefore indicating plasmid curing. This technique can easily be applied to curing other plasmids as well.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to 1989, the {{standard}} treatment for acute melioidosis was a three-drug combination of <b>chloramphenicol,</b> co-trimoxazole and doxycycline; this regimen {{is associated with}} a mortality rate of 80% and is no longer be used unless no other alternatives are available. [...] All three drugs are bacteriostatic (they stop the bacterium from growing, but do not kill it) and the action of co-trimoxazole antagonizes both <b>chloramphenicol</b> and doxycycline.|$|E
2500|$|The {{initial choice}} of {{antibiotic}} depends upon personal choice, experience and availability, but could include <b>chloramphenicol,</b> chlortetracycline, bacitracin-neomycin-polymyxin (BNP), ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and tobramycin. [...] Topical gentamicin formulations are also available, {{but in the}} opinion of some, should be reserved for cases with stromal melting. [...] Frequency of application can vary from q1h to q8h, depending on both the severity of the lesion, and the formulation used (ointment vs. drops).|$|E
2500|$|... {{have been}} {{associated}} with agranulocytosis, including antiepileptics (such as carbamazepine and valproate), antithyroid drugs (carbimazole, methimazole, and propylthiouracil), antibiotics (penicillin, <b>chloramphenicol</b> and co-trimoxazole), ACE inhibitors (benazepril), cytotoxic drugs, gold, NSAIDs (indomethacin, naproxen, phenylbutazone, metamizole), mebendazole, allopurinol the antidepressants mianserin and mirtazapine, and some antipsychotics (the atypical antipsychotic clozapine in particular). Clozapine users in the United States, Australia, Canada, and the UK must be nationally registered for monitoring of low WBC and absolute neutrophil counts (ANC).|$|E
2500|$|While ESBL-producing organisms were {{previously}} associated with hospitals and institutional care, these organisms are now increasingly {{found in the}} community. [...] CTX-M-15-positive E. coli are a cause of community-acquired urinary infections in the UK, and tend to be resistant to all oral β-lactam antibiotics, as well as quinolones and sulfonamides. [...] Treatment options may include nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, mecillinam and <b>chloramphenicol.</b> [...] In desperation, once-daily ertapenem or gentamicin injections may also be used.|$|E
2500|$|The {{antibiotic}} {{of choice}} is ceftazidime. While various antibiotics are active in vitro (e.g., <b>chloramphenicol,</b> doxycycline, co-trimoxazole), they have been proven to be inferior in vivo {{for the treatment of}} acute melioidosis. Disc diffusion tests are unreliable when looking for co-trimoxazole resistance in B.pseudomallei (they greatly overestimate resistance) and Etests or agar dilution tests should be used in preference. The actions of co-trimoxazole and doxycycline are antagonistic, which suggests [...] these two drugs ought not to be used together.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{treatment}} of the acute disease, [...] eradication (or maintenance) treatment with co-trimoxazole and doxycycline is recommended to be used for 12 to 20 weeks to reduce the rate of recurrence. <b>Chloramphenicol</b> is no longer routinely recommended for this purpose. [...] Co-amoxiclav is an alternative for those patients who are unable to take co-trimoxazole and doxycycline (e.g., pregnant women and {{children under the age of}} 12), but is not as effective. [...] Single agent treatment with a fluoroquinolone (e.g., ciprofloxacin) or doxycycline for the oral maintenance phase is ineffective.|$|E
2500|$|The serendipitous {{discovery}} and subsequent clinical success of penicillin prompted a large-scale search for other environmental microorganisms that might produce anti-infective natural products. [...] Soil and water {{samples were collected}} {{from all over the}} world, leading to the discovery of streptomycin (derived from Streptomyces griseus), and the realization that bacteria, not just fungi, represent an important source of pharmacologically active natural products. [...] This, in turn, {{led to the development of}} an impressive arsenal of antibacterial and antifungal agents including amphotericin B, <b>chloramphenicol,</b> daptomycin and tetracycline (from Streptomyces spp.), the polymyxins (from Paenibacillus polymyxa), and the rifamycins (from Amycolatopsis rifamycinica).|$|E
2500|$|For Burkholderia pseudomallei, some {{clinical}} antibiotic {{agents that}} are used to treat its infection, mellioidosis, can induce morphological changes such as filamentation and physiological changes in this bacteria. These antibiotics are the β-lactam antibiotics, fluoroquinolones, and antibiotics that inhibit the synthesis of thymidine. The ability of some β-lactam antibiotics to induce filamentation in gram negative bacteria is to inhibit penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). This inhibition stops the assembly of peptidoglycan network in bacterial cell wall. PBP-1 inhibition leads to rapid cell death. While PBP-2 and PBP-3 inhibition lead to morphological change, turn normal cells to spheroplasts and filamentous cells (elongated rods), respectively. PBP-3 forms the septum in dividing bacteria by involving transpeptidase so inhibition of this PBP-3 protein leads to the incomplete formation of septa in dividing bacteria resulting in the formation of long strands of bacteria (filaments). [...] Kang Chen et al. mentioned that the filament was induced by sublethal concentrations of ceftazidime, ofloxacin, or trimethoprim. At or below the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), filamentation occurred mainly at these concentration and bacteria remained as viable within the vacuoles of immortalized human macrophages, not rapidly killed. [...] However, the B.pseudomallei filaments revert to normal forms when the antibiotics are removed. Moreover, bacillary daughter cells maintained cell-division capacity and viability despite re-exposure to antibiotics such as ceftazidime. Thus, this developmental alteration may provide additionally survival advantages to bacteria. [...] Furthermore, for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, filamentation induced by antibiotics appears to trigger bacteria to change from a normal growth phase to a stationary growth phase. [...] Filamentous bacteria are also associated with an increase in endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) release and the immune system of patients needs to cope with this characteristic. <b>Chloramphenicol</b> antibiotic can induce the formation of filamentous cells, which contain multiple copies of unsegregated chromosomes. These chromosomes lead to the unsuccessful division of elongated cells, and the formation of bacterial filament. Moreover, the filamentation also depends on the expression levels of an efflux pump (MexAB-OprM) and the minimum inhibitory concentration of <b>chloramphenicol.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In hens, {{tamarind}} {{has been}} found to lower cholesterol in their serum, and in the yolks of the eggs they laid. Due to a lack of available human clinical trials, there is insufficient evidence to recommend tamarind for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia or diabetes. Different parts of tamarind (T. indica) are recognized for their various medicinal properties. A previous study reported that the seed, leaf, leaf veins, fruit pulp and skin extracts of tamarind possessed high phenolic content and antioxidant activities. The presence of lupanone and lupeol, [...] catechin, epicatechin, quercetin and isorhamnetin [...] in the leaf extract could have contributed towards the diverse range of the medicinal activities. On the other hand, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) analyses revealed that tamarind seeds contained catechin, procyanidin B2, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, <b>chloramphenicol,</b> myricetin, morin, quercetin, apigenin and kaempferol. The treatment of tamarind leaves on liver HepG2 cells significantly regulated the expression of genes and proteins involved with consequential impact on the coagulation system, cholesterol biosynthesis, xenobiotic metabolism signaling and antimicrobial response.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Chloramphenicol</b> succinate ester {{is used as}} an {{intravenous}} prodrug of <b>chloramphenicol,</b> because pure <b>chloramphenicol</b> {{does not}} dissolve in water.|$|E
50|$|Three {{mechanisms}} {{of resistance to}} <b>chloramphenicol</b> are known: reduced membrane permeability, mutation of the 50S ribosomal subunit, and elaboration of <b>chloramphenicol</b> acetyltransferase. It is easy to select for reduced membrane permeability to <b>chloramphenicol</b> in vitro by serial passage of bacteria, {{and this is the}} most common mechanism of low-level <b>chloramphenicol</b> resistance. High-level resistance is conferred by the cat-gene; this gene codes for an enzyme called <b>chloramphenicol</b> acetyltransferase, which inactivates <b>chloramphenicol</b> by covalently linking one or two acetyl groups, derived from acetyl-S-coenzyme A, to the hydroxyl groups on the <b>chloramphenicol</b> molecule. The acetylation prevents <b>chloramphenicol</b> from binding to the ribosome. Resistance-conferring mutations of the 50S ribosomal subunit are rare.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Chloramphenicol</b> acetyltransferase (or CAT) is a {{bacterial}} enzyme (...) that detoxifies the antibiotic <b>chloramphenicol</b> and {{is responsible for}} <b>chloramphenicol</b> resistance in bacteria. This enzyme covalently attaches an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to <b>chloramphenicol,</b> which prevents <b>chloramphenicol</b> from binding to ribosomes. A histidine residue, located in the C-terminal section of the enzyme, plays {{a central role in}} its catalytic mechanism.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chloramphenicol</b> is {{available}} as a capsule or as a liquid. In some countries, it is sold as <b>chloramphenicol</b> palmitate ester (CPE). CPE is inactive, and is hydrolysed to active <b>chloramphenicol</b> in the small intestine. No difference in bioavailability is noted between <b>chloramphenicol</b> and CPE.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chloramphenicol</b> is metabolized by {{the liver}} to <b>chloramphenicol</b> {{glucuronate}} (which is inactive). In liver impairment, the dose of <b>chloramphenicol</b> {{must therefore be}} reduced. No standard dose reduction exists for <b>chloramphenicol</b> in liver impairment, and the dose should be adjusted according to measured plasma concentrations.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of the <b>chloramphenicol</b> dose is excreted by the kidneys as the inactive metabolite, <b>chloramphenicol</b> glucuronate. Only {{a tiny fraction of}} the <b>chloramphenicol</b> is excreted by the kidneys unchanged. Plasma levels should be monitored in patients with renal impairment, but this is not mandatory. <b>Chloramphenicol</b> succinate ester (an intravenous prodrug form) is readily excreted unchanged by the kidneys, more so than <b>chloramphenicol</b> base, and this is the major reason why levels of <b>chloramphenicol</b> in the blood are much lower when given intravenously than orally.|$|E
50|$|Examples of amphenicols include <b>chloramphenicol,</b> thiamphenicol, {{azidamfenicol}} and florfenicol. The first-in-class compound was <b>chloramphenicol,</b> {{introduced in}} 1949. <b>Chloramphenicol</b> was initially discovered {{as a natural}} product, but all amphenicols are now made by chemical synthesis.|$|E

5000|$|The {{intravenous}} (IV) {{preparation of}} <b>chloramphenicol</b> is the succinate ester, because pure <b>chloramphenicol</b> does not dissolve in water. This creates a problem: <b>Chloramphenicol</b> succinate ester is an inactive prodrug and {{must first be}} hydrolysed to chloramphenicol; however, the hydrolysis process is often incomplete, and 30% of the dose is lost and removed in the urine. Serum concentrations of IV <b>chloramphenicol</b> are only 70% of those achieved when <b>chloramphenicol</b> is given orally. [...] For this reason, the dose needs to be increased to 75 mg/kg/day when administered IV to achieve levels equivalent to the oral dose.|$|E
5000|$|While the U.S. {{has tested}} farm-raised shrimp for <b>chloramphenicol</b> since 1994, {{over the last}} decade the FDA {{developed}} a more sensitive testing methodology and changed the levels of detection for <b>chloramphenicol</b> in response to increasing discovery of traces of <b>chloramphenicol</b> in imports.
