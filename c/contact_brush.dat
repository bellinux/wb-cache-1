50|$|Typically, {{slip ring}} {{consists}} of a stationary graphite or metal <b>contact</b> (<b>brush)</b> which rubs on the outside diameter of a rotating metal ring. As the metal ring turns, the electric current or signal is conducted through the stationary brush to the metal ring making the connection. Additional ring/brush assemblies are stacked along the rotating axis if more than one electrical circuit is needed. Either the brushes or the rings are stationary and the other component rotates.This simple design {{has been used for}} decades as a rudimentary method of passing current into a rotating device.|$|E

50|$|Permanent magnet {{generators}} (PMGs) or alternators (PMAs) do {{not require}} a DC supply for the excitation circuit, nor do they have slip rings and <b>contact</b> <b>brushes.</b> A key disadvantage in PMAs or PMGs is that the air gap flux is not controllable, so the voltage of the machine cannot be easily regulated. A persistent magnetic field imposes safety issues during assembly, field service or repair. High performance permanent magnets, themselves, have structural and thermal issues. Torque current MMF vectorially combines with the persistent flux of permanent magnets, which leads to higher air-gap flux density and eventually, core saturation. In this permanent magnet alternators the speed is directly proportional to the output voltage of the alternator.|$|R
50|$|Railway {{electrification}} as a {{means of}} traction emerged {{at the end of the}} nineteenth century, although experiments in electric rail have been traced back to the mid-nineteenth century. Thomas Davenport, in Brandon, Vermont, erected a circular model railroad on which ran battery-powered locomotives (or locomotives running on battery-powered rails) in 1834. Robert Davidson, of Aberdeen, Scotland, created an electric locomotive in 1839 and ran it on the Edinburgh-Glasgow railway at 4 miles per hour. The earliest electric locomotives tended to be battery-powered. In 1880, Thomas Edison built a small electrical railway, using a dynamo as the motor and the rails as the current-carrying medium.

40|$|INTRODUCTION As {{advanced}} engineering materials, composites {{are used in}} many applications where high wear resistance is required; these include electrical <b>contact</b> <b>brushes,</b> cylinder liners, artificial joints, and helicopter blades. Indeed, compared to monolithic materials, wear resistance can generally be enhanced by introducing a secondary phase(s) into the matrix material [1 - 6]. In this fashion, the wear properties can be varied substantially through changes in the microstructure, the morphology, volume fraction and mechanical properties of the reinforcing phase, {{and the nature of}} the interface between matrix and reinforcement. In order to obtain optimal wear properties without compromising the beneficial properties of the matrix material, an accurate prediction of the wear of composites is essential. Unfortunately, for abrasive wear, existing models for composites are highly simplified and do not readily predict the role of the composite microstructure. In general, they are ba...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} simple method to {{reversibly}} switch the adhesive force between two surfaces that {{are decorated with}} poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) graft polymers. By employment of a PMMA/isopropanol/water or a PMMA/ethanol/water cosolvent system, we can tune the swelling of the brushes. In pure isopropanol or ethanol the polymer grafts are collapsed, and the adhesion is high when the <b>contacting</b> <b>brushes</b> are pulled apart. In an 80 – 20 vol % isopropanol–water or ethanol–water composition, the brushes are swollen. In these systems the adhesion is approximately 5 times smaller compared to the adhesion measured in the pure solvent systems. Moreover, we show that PMMA/isopropanol/water cosolvent systems perform better as switchable adhesives than PMMA/ethanol/water cosolvent systems. In the latter pulling events can arise when the swollen brushes are kept in contact for a longer time, such that the adhesion hysteresis can become large and the surface coating can be damaged due to bond-breaking events...|$|R
5000|$|The {{resistance}} of the sliding <b>contact</b> between <b>brush</b> and commutator causes a voltage drop called the [...] "brush drop". This may be several volts, so it can cause large power losses in low voltage, high current machines.

40|$|The {{adhesion}} {{between a}} grafted polyelectrolyte layer (brush) and a gel of an oppositely charged polyelectrolyte has been measured {{as a function}} of applied pressure, and the interface has been traced using neutron reflectometry. The interface (in aqueous medium at pH 6) between the (polycationic) brush and the (polyanionic) gel has a limited pressure-dependence, {{with a small amount of}} deformation of the interface at the brush-gel <b>contact.</b> <b>Brushes</b> with a dry thickness of up to 13 nm exhibit weak adhesion (measured using a mechanical force tester) with an adhesive failure when the gel is detached. Thicker brushes result in the gel exhibiting cohesive failure. Reversing the geometry, whereby a polycationic brush is replaced with a polyanion and the polyanionic gel is replaced with a polycation reveals that the pH-dependence of the adhesion is moderately symmetric about pH 6, but that the maximum force required to separate the polycation gel from the polyanion brush over the range of pH is greater than that for the polycation brush and polyanion gel. The polyanion used is poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) and polycations of poly[2 -(diethyl amino) ethyl methacrylate] (PDEAEMA) and poly[2 -(dimethyl amino) ethyl methacrylate] (PDMAEMA) were used...|$|R

Similarly the segment coming into <b>contact</b> with the <b>brush</b> has a similar ramping up of the current.

40|$|Homopolar motors {{have been}} {{proposed}} as an alternative propulsion means for ships. Such motors operate in a very harsh and demanding environment, making in-situ diagnostics and fault-monitoring systems a key issue for extended operation. In a typical homopolar motor, several thousand brushes are used, which are all in sliding contact with a copper rotor at a velocity of about 10 m/s. Wear and degradation of the brush and rotor are key issues {{that need to be}} understood in order to design a reliable motor. In this investigation, acoustic emission transducers were used to study the characteristics of the brush/rotor interface of a homopolar motor as a function of speed, load, materials, and other design parameters. The AE sensors were directly coupled to the brush in the homopolar motor test rig, and data were obtained over extended periods of time.

The sound source was a series of vacuum tubes which created 10 preset electronic drum sounds. The drum sounds were 'sequenced' by a rotating wiper arm with <b>contact</b> <b>brushes</b> on it that swept around a phenolic panel with corresponding contacts arranged in a pattern of concentric circles across its face; these were spaced in certain patterns to generate parts of a particular rhythm. Combinations of these different sets of rhythms and drum sounds created popular rhythmic patterns of the day, e.g. waltzes, fox trots etc. These combinations were selected by a rotary knob {{on the top of the}} Side Man box. The tempo of the patterns was controlled by a slider that increased the speed of rotation of the wiper arm. The Side Man had a panel of 10 buttons for manually triggering drum sounds, and a remote player to control the machine while playing from an organ keyboard. The Side Man was housed in a mahogany cabinet that contained the sound-generating circuitry, amplifier and speaker.|$|R
