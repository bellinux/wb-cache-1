5|$|The {{hair color}} of Highland cattle <b>can</b> <b>vary</b> from black, brindled, red, yellow and dun. The coat colors {{are caused by}} alleles at the MC1R gene (Elocus) and the PMEL or SILV gene (Dlocus).|$|E
5|$|The {{school year}} lasts for nine months, and {{is divided into}} two terms: autumn and spring. Students attend around 32–40 lessons a week, each lasting 40–80 minutes. This <b>can</b> <b>vary</b> {{drastically}} between institutions.|$|E
5000|$|Another facet in variational {{principles}} in {{quantum mechanics is}} that since [...] and [...] <b>can</b> be <b>varied</b> separately (a fact arising due to the complex nature of the wave function), the quantities <b>can</b> be <b>varied</b> in principle just one at a time.|$|R

5|$|A {{semi-arid}} desert or a steppe is {{a version}} of the arid desert with much more rainfall, vegetation and higher humidity. These regions feature a semi-arid climate and are less extreme than regular deserts. Like arid deserts, temperatures <b>can</b> <b>vary</b> greatly in semi deserts. They share some characteristics of a true desert and are usually located at the edge of deserts and continental dry areas. They usually receive precipitation from 250mm (10in) to 500mm (20in) but this <b>can</b> <b>vary</b> due to evapotranspiration and soil nutrition. Semi deserts {{can be found in the}} Tabernas Desert (and some of the Spanish Plateau), The Sahel, The Eurasian Steppe, most of Central Asia, the Western US, most of Northern Mexico, portions of South America (especially in Argentina) and the Australian Outback. They usually feature BSh (hot steppe) or BSk (temperate steppe) in the Köppen climate classification.|$|E

5|$|Adults are {{extremely}} mobile during the day, and find refuge in resting sites in flowers and young leaves {{at night and}} early morning. They migrate from crop to crop following flower availability. Field density <b>can</b> <b>vary.</b> In France, numbers are around 20 adults/100 plants {{at the beginning of}} the colonization and 150 adults/100 plants at population peak when pressure is high.|$|E
5|$|All the motifs <b>can</b> <b>vary</b> {{considerably}} in appearance {{according to the}} weaver. Colours, sizes and shapes can all be chosen according to taste and the tradition in a given village or tribe; further, motifs are often combined, as illustrated in the photographs above. To give some idea of this variability, a few alternative forms are shown in the table.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{depending}} {{on the model of}} the roller coaster, the track size <b>can</b> <b>vary.</b> Models such as the Flying, Wing, and Dive Coaster have heavier trains which require a larger track size while models with lighter trains, such as the Stand-Up and Hyper Coaster, do not and use a smaller sized track.|$|E
50|$|In {{four-stroke}} cycle engines and some two-stroke cycle engines, the valve timing {{is controlled by}} the camshaft. It <b>can</b> be <b>varied</b> by modifying the camshaft, or it <b>can</b> be <b>varied</b> during engine operation by variable valve timing. It is also affected by the adjustment of the valve mechanism, and particularly by the tappet clearance. However, this variation is normally unwanted.|$|R

5|$|Among {{the many}} ways of {{classifying}} plants are by regional floras, which, depending on the purpose of study, can also include fossil flora, remnants of plant life from a previous era. People in many regions and countries take great pride in their individual arrays of characteristic flora, which <b>can</b> <b>vary</b> widely across the globe {{due to differences in}} climate and terrain.|$|E
5|$|Down {{the middle}} of the sublingua is a thick {{strengthening}} rod called the plica mediana or lytta, which connects the sublingua to the underside of the tongue, and is part of the lingual septum (septum of the tongue). The thickness and size of the plica mediana <b>can</b> <b>vary</b> between species, and except in treeshrews, it is cartilaginous and provides support for the sublingua.|$|E
5|$|Mars has {{the largest}} dust storms in the Solar System. These <b>can</b> <b>vary</b> from a storm over a small area, to {{gigantic}} storms that cover the entire planet. They tend to occur when Mars is closest to the Sun, and {{have been shown to}} increase the global temperature.|$|E

5|$|Millipedes {{in several}} orders have keel-like {{extensions}} of the body-wall known as paranota, which <b>can</b> <b>vary</b> widely in shape, size, and texture; modifications include lobes, papillae, ridges, crests, spines and notches. Paranota may allow millipedes to wedge more securely into crevices, protect the legs, or make the millipede more difficult for predators to swallow.|$|E

5|$|The RNA is {{typically}} cleaved before transcription termination, as CstF also binds to RNA polymerase II. Through a poorly understood mechanism (as of 2002), it signals for RNA polymerase II to slip {{off of the}} transcript. Cleavage also involves the protein CFII, though it is unknown how. The cleavage site associated with a polyadenylation signal <b>can</b> <b>vary</b> up to some 50 nucleotides.|$|E
