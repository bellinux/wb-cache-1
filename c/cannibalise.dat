5|$|Myrmecia {{is one of}} {{the very}} few genera where the workers lay trophic eggs, or {{infertile}} eggs laid as food for viable offspring. Workers laying trophic eggs have only been reported in two species; these species are M. forceps and M. gulosa. Depending on the species, colonies specialise in trophallaxis; queens and larvae eat eggs that are laid by worker individuals, but the workers do not feed on eggs. Neither adults nor larvae consume food during winter, but cannibalism among larvae is known to occur throughout the year. The larvae only <b>cannibalise</b> each other; this is most likely to happen when no dead insects are available.|$|E
25|$|This variant {{is to be}} a {{replacement}} for the Boeing 747-400, tentatively dubbed the A350-8000, -2000 or -1100. Within the June 2016 Airbus Innovation Days, chief commercial officer John Leahy was concerned {{about the size of a}} 400-seat market besides the Boeing 747-8 and the 777-9 and chief executive Fabrice Brégier feared such an aircraft could <b>cannibalise</b> demand for the -1000.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} involved was an Ilyushin Il-76, a large Russian-built cargo aircraft. Registered as EW-78849, the Il-76 {{had been}} on a chartered cargo flight carrying equipment to Ugandan AMISOM peacekeepers in the Somali capital of Mogadishu. All of the crew members were Belarusian. Four of the personnel on board the accident aircraft were engineers who had worked on repairing another aircraft of the same type that had been the subject of an attempted shootdown 14 days earlier. Much of the equipment on board EW-78849 was for repairing the aircraft damaged earlier; the rest of the cargo was humanitarian aid. The first aircraft was still crippled at the departure time of EW-78849, and TransAVIAexport were considering whether to <b>cannibalise</b> it for re-usable parts.|$|E

25|$|On 23 May 1940, Armstrong Whitworth Ensign G-ADTA Euryalus of British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) crash-landed at RAF Lympne and was damaged. The {{aircraft}} {{was one of}} six that escaped after a Luftwaffe raid on Merville Airfield, France. The intended destination was Croydon. Approaching the English coast, anti-aircraft fire was encountered, first she lost her port inner engine and the pilot set course for RAF Hawkinge. A short time later her starboard inner engine also had to be shut down. The pilot changed course for Lympne. On landing, the starboard undercarriage was not fully down, causing the wing to scrape {{the ground and the}} aircraft to go through a fence as no braking was attempted. Euryalus was flown to RAF Hamble in June, but it was decided to <b>cannibalise</b> her to repair G-ADSU Euterpe which had been damaged in an accident at Bonnington??? on 15 December 1939. Euryalus was officially written off on 15 November 1941 and scrapped in September 1942.|$|E
500|$|Adults mate between March and June. In the {{monitored}} populations at York, mating of {{the same}} pair could last over 24 hours, during which time some pairs moved between tansy patches. [...] Mating in a Russian population of C. graminis is preceded by an elaborate ritual not evident in other populations of the species, involving the male tapping the female's eyes, pronotum and antennae with its antennae. Mated females lay batches of 3–15 elongated, yellow eggs (each 2mm long) {{on the underside of}} the tansy leaves. Eggs hatch into grey larvae. In captivity, one newly mated female produced 561 eggs over 136 days and another produced 158 eggs over 49 days. Females will lay in several locations; the average clutch size is 5–6 eggs. Female C. graminis will <b>cannibalise</b> the eggs of other females. In laboratory conditions, newly hatched larvae have been shown to survive for at least four days without food and thus have a long window of opportunity in which to reach a tansy plant. In July, the final instar larvae burrow underground beneath the plant to pupate, although very little is known about the biology of this process in C. graminis. Between August and September, this new adult population emerges to feed before returning underground to overwinter in October; emergence of adults is from March to April the next year. Long-term monitoring has indicated that survival during winter hibernation is surprisingly high, as autumn and spring population sizes are very similar. This is despite annual winter flooding of the River Ouse, implying that overwintering individuals must be extremely tolerant of long periods of inundation and oxygen deprivation. Approximately 5% of overwintering adults do not emerge from the soil after the winter, but remain underground for the next year in a state of extended diapause and emerge in the following spring.|$|E

Rescue operations were suspended while the repairs were made. PK-7500 arrived from the coast where it had launched its DSRV.

They proceeded to enslave some Moriori and kill and <b>cannibalise</b> others. [...] "Parties of warriors armed with muskets, clubs and tomahawks, led by their chiefs, walked through Moriori tribal territories and settlements without warning, permission or greeting. If the districts were wanted by the invaders, they curtly informed the inhabitants that their land had been taken and the Moriori living there were now vassals." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 28 January 1972 – A British Caledonian Vickers VC10-1109 (registration: G-ARTA) with no {{passengers}} aboard sustained severe {{structural damage}} {{as a result}} of a hard landing at Gatwick at the end of a short ferry flight from Heathrow, where the aircraft had been diverted due to fog at Gatwick. After touching down on runway 08 and applying spoilers and reverse thrust, the aircraft became airborne again, bounced twice and landed heavily. This resulted in a burst front wheel tyre, a separated wheel and a crumpled fuselage (immediately in front of and behind the wings). A survey of the aircraft's damage revealed that its airframe was bent out of shape, requiring extensive repairs to be restored to airworthiness. Since the repairs were not cost-effective, the airline's management decided to <b>cannibalise</b> the aircraft for spare parts before scrapping it at Gatwick in 1975.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{change of}} venue was {{proposed}} in 2008, with New South Wales authorities making clear their desire to bid for hosting rights to the tournament once Melbourne's contract expires in 2016. In response, Wayne Kayler-Thomson, {{the head of the}} Victorian Events Industry Council, was adamant that Melbourne should retain the event. In a scathing attack of the New South Wales authorities, he said, [...] "It is disappointing that NSW cannot be original and seek their own events instead of trying to <b>cannibalise</b> other Australian cities." [...] Since the proposal was made, a major redevelopment of Melbourne Park has been announced, which is expected to run into {{the hundreds of millions of}} dollars. Melbourne Park will include upgraded and increased seating in major venues, a roof over Margaret Court Arena, improved player facilities, a new headquarters for Tennis Australia and a partly covered [...] "town square" [...] area featuring large televisions showing current tennis play. A year later, these plans were largely approved, with former Premier of Victoria John Brumby confirming the state government's willingness to commit 363million to complete the renovations, a move which guaranteed there will be no {{change of venue}} until at least beyond 2036.|$|E
2500|$|Not all plant cells {{respond to}} hormones, but those cells that do are {{programmed}} to respond at specific points in their growth cycle. [...] The greatest effects occur at specific stages during the cell's life, with diminished effects occurring {{before or after}} this period. Plants need hormones at very specific times during plant growth and at specific locations. [...] They also need to disengage the effects that hormones have when {{they are no longer}} needed. The production of hormones occurs very often at sites of active growth within the meristems, before cells have fully differentiated. After production, they are sometimes moved {{to other parts of the}} plant, where they cause an immediate effect; or they can be stored in cells to be released later. Plants use different pathways to regulate internal hormone quantities and moderate their effects; they can regulate the amount of chemicals used to biosynthesize hormones. [...] They can store them in cells, inactivate them, or <b>cannibalise</b> already-formed hormones by conjugating them with carbohydrates, amino acids, or peptides. Plants can also break down hormones chemically, effectively destroying them. Plant hormones frequently regulate the concentrations of other plant hormones. Plants also move hormones around the plant diluting their concentrations.|$|E
