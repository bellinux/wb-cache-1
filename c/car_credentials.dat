40|$|International audienceMobile Money {{is growing}} in the {{developed}} world while cars are becoming much smarter. Combine the two - and you get cars that `own' a wallet. We propose not a user-centric, but a car-centric service that enables cars to have Pre-Pay subscription accounts for car-related purchases and for linking to financial services. The solution uses advanced car communications capability and securely stored <b>car</b> <b>credentials</b> to offer enhanced authentication security, which is a pre-requisite for such financial services. We propose strengthening the authentication procedure further with the `Twin-Set' (of `Two-Factor') method using both car-based and SIM-based authentication, and the `Twin-Step' confirmation method for service authorization. In this paper we present an innovative use of advanced technologies, combining M 2 M, Mobile-Money, Automotive Communications and advanced security procedure...|$|E
5000|$|The engines {{started out}} as the 3,820cc straight-eight from the car's predecessor, but the side-valves in the earlier car were now {{replaced}} by overhead valves. A new [...] "Mercedes-Benz twin carburetor" [...] was also fitted. More newsworthy was {{the availability of a}} [...] "Kompressor" [...] (Supercharger) which instantly established the <b>car's</b> <b>credentials</b> as technologically advanced and which with the benefit of hindsight applied an approach which became mainstream in the auto-industry only half a century later.|$|R
5000|$|More of {{a luxury}} model than the SE5, the SE6 series was {{promoted}} to the executive market. These models were two-door sports estates, again with the Ford V6 3.0 L engine as used in the SE5A with 135 bhp,: the wheelbase was increased by 4 in and the track by 3 in making the cars correspondingly longer and wider than their predecessors. [...] The extra length was used to improve rear-seat legroom and access which enhanced the <b>car's</b> <b>credentials</b> as a 'genuine' four-seater. Noticeable changes from the earlier models were {{the increase in the}} outer headlamp size from 5.3/4" [...] to 7" [...] and the replacement of the chrome plated bumpers with rubber ones. A Laycock overdrive on 3rd and 4th gear was optional. The SE6 was replaced by the SE6A in late 1976. 543 SE6 models were produced.|$|R

Smart credentials eliminate the inherent weaknesses and costs of password authentication, and bypass the risk posed by legacy physical card-access systems. Smart credentials let you provide secure access to computer networks (logical access) and buildings (physical access). |$|R
50|$|As {{described}} in a film magazine, Speed Carr (Reid), driving from New York to Los Angeles to visit an uncle he has not seen in twenty years, is robbed of his <b>car,</b> clothing, and <b>credentials</b> by tramps and reaches the coast penniless wearing a borrowed suit of clothes. At his uncle's bank he is refused money. Carr pawns his watch under the name Barry Cole and, adopting this name, secures a position as chauffeur for Donald McPherson (Marshall), father of Sallie McPherson (Hawley), {{with whom he has}} fallen in love. After they elope, he reveals his identity and his uncle appears to give his blessing.|$|R
