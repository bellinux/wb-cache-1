Coffee {{was introduced to}} Marseilles by Pierre de La Roque in 1664, but the fashion for coffee in Paris was triggered by the Ottoman ambassador to Louis XIV, Suleiman Aga, in 1669. Fashionable coffee-shops emerged such as the famous Café Procope, the first <b>coffee-shop</b> of Paris, in 1689. In the French high society wearing turbans and caftans became fashionable, as well as lying on rugs and cushions.|$|E
500|$|Gibson's {{writing was}} {{positively}} received by science fiction writers Dennis Danvers, Candas Jane Dorsey, and Rudy Rucker. Rucker has written: [...] "ith a poet's touch, he tiles words into wonderful mosaics" [...] and Danvers wrote that [...] "no sentence has a subject {{if it can}} do without one". One critic found the prose to be as [...] "hard and compact as glacier ice" [...] and another that it [...] "gives us sharply observed small moments inscribed with crystalline clarity". Gibson's descriptions of interiors and of the built environments of Tokyo, Russia and London were singled out as impressive, and The Village Voices review remarked that [...] "Gibson expertly replicates the biosphere of a discussion board: the <b>coffee-shop</b> intimacy, the fishbowl paranoia, the splintering factions, the inevitable flame war". Lisa Zeidner of The New York Times Book Review elaborated: As usual, Gibson's prose is ... corpuscular, crenelated. His sentences slide from silk to steel, and take tonal joy rides from the ironic to the earnest. But he never gets lost in the language, as he sometimes has in the past. Structurally, this may be his most confident novel. The secondary characters and their subplots are more fully developed, right down to their personal e-mail styles. Without any metafictional grandstanding, Gibson nails the texture of Internet culture: {{how it feels to}} be close to someone you know only as a voice in a chat room, or to fret about someone spying on your browser's list of sites visited. Filled with name-dropping of businesses and products, such as MUJI, Hotmail, iBook, Netscape, and G4, the language of the novel was judged by one critic to be [...] "awkward in its effort to appear [...] "cool"" [...] while other critics have found it overdone and feared it would quickly date the novel. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette review commented that the [...] "constant, unadulterated [...] "hipster-technocrat, cyber-MTV" [...] lingo [...] overdone and inappropriate" [...] On the technology, Cory Doctorow found Gibson's use of watermarks and keystroke logging to be hollow and has noted that [...] "Gibson is no technologist, he's an accomplished and insightful social critic ... and he treats these items from the real world as metaphor. But ... Gibson's metaphorical treatment of these technologies will date this very fine book".|$|E

He entrusted the nondescript with a confidential message to her, importing that the visitor who had waited {{on her father}} last night, begged the favour of a few words with her at her uncle's lodging; he obtained from the same source full directions to the house, which was very near; dismissed the nondescript gratified with half-a-crown; and having hastily refreshed himself at the <b>coffee-shop,</b> repaired with all speed to the clarionet-player's dwelling.|$|E

60|$|Well, I {{went into}} the <b>coffee-shop,</b> and spent fourpence.

The waiter had nothing. At any rate, fourpence I know was the sum I spent. And the hunger appeased, I got on the coach a guilty being.|$|E

60|$|How well I {{remember}} the forlorn aspect of Fleet Street when I {{came out of}} the Temple! The street-lamps flickering in the gusty north-east wind, as if the very gas were contorted with cold; the white-topped houses; the bleak, star-lighted sky; the market people and other early stragglers, trotting to circulate their almost frozen blood; the hospitable light and warmth of the few <b>coffee-shops</b> and public-houses that were open for such customers; the hard, dry, frosty rime with which the air was charged (the wind had already beaten it into every crevice), and which lashed my face like a steel whip.|$|R
60|$|He made {{a hearty}} breakfast at a {{neighbouring}} <b>coffee-shop,</b> and, returning home, lit {{the fire and}} sat before it, smoking. The return of the four children from school, soon after midday, found him still wrestling with the difficulties of the situation.

50|$|The Brotherhood {{initially}} resembled {{an ordinary}} Islamic welfare society. In the early 1930s, its welfare activities included small-scale social work among the poor, building and repairing mosques {{and establishing a}} number of Qur'an schools (whose role in teaching children {{to read and write}} was important in a country where 80% of the population was illiterate), setting up small workshops and factories, and organising the collection and distribution of zakat (the Islamic alms tax). As the Society grew, it increasingly founded benevolent institutions such as pharmacies, hospitals and clinics for the general public, and launched a program to teach adults to read and write by offering courses in <b>coffee-shops</b> and clubs.|$|R

Ljugarn is the oldest seaside resort in Gotland, and was formerly a port, fishing village, pilot station and the county seat of Ljugarn County. The 1.5 km long flat sandy beach, one of the longest in Gotland, is visited throughout the year. Since the early 20th century the village has had pensions, restaurants, hostels, <b>coffee-shops</b> and a grocery store.|$|R
3000|$|Future work {{involves}} {{exploring a}} combination of the heuristics in real deployments as well as other application-specific spatial and geographically based heuristics, and heuristics that exploit historical information—so, for example, we can include historical information in computing probabilities, i.e. for a region r, we calculate Pr([...] F(r) = TRUE | obs(N(r)) ∧ [...] history(r)). There are also many applications to explore, from finding vacant/quiet <b>coffee-shops</b> to finding strategic points of interest in emergency situations. Dealing with uncertainties and unresponsive crowds are further issues to consider, e.g., taking into account regions with low density of people. We did not deal with the problem of incentives and strategic sampling will need to be considered in the future.|$|R
60|$|I {{live in a}} lodging in the Clapham Road--a {{very clean}} back room, in a very respectable house--where I am {{expected}} not {{to be at home}} in the day-time, unless poorly; and which I usually leave in the morning at nine o'clock, on pretence of going to business. I take my breakfast--my roll and butter, and my half-pint of coffee--at the old-established <b>coffee-shop</b> near Westminster Bridge; and then I go into the City--I don't know why--and sit in Garraway's Coffee House, and on 'Change, and walk about, and look into a few offices and counting-houses where some of my relations or acquaintance are so good as to tolerate me, and where I stand by the fire if the weather happens to be cold. I get through the day in this way until five o'clock, and then I dine: at a cost, on the average, of one and threepence. Having still a little money to spend on my evening's entertainment, I look into the old-established <b>coffee-shop</b> as I go home, and take my cup of tea, and perhaps my bit of toast. So, as the large hand of the clock makes its way round to the morning hour again, I make my way round to the Clapham Road again, and go to bed when I get to my lodging--fire being expensive, and being objected to by the family on account of its giving trouble and making a dirt.|$|E

A beautiful August morning--I am very hungry. There is Rasherwell [...] "tucking" [...] away in the coffee-room. I pace the street, as sadly almost as if I had been coming to school, not going thence. I turn into a court by mere chance--I vow it was by mere chance--and there I see a <b>coffee-shop</b> with a placard in the window, Coffee, Twopence. Round of buttered toast, Twopence. And here am I, hungry, penniless, with five-and-twenty shillings of my parents' money in my pocket.|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of a {{research}} project concerned with contemporary cafés, one in which <b>coffee-shops</b> have loomed large, it has been appropriate to revisit Habermas’s famous 1962 / 1989 work on the transformation of the ‘public sphere’, wherein the figure of the Early Modern English coffeehouse holds considerable significance. The outlines of Habermas’s claims are inspected, and three lines of critique – to do with spatiality, sociability and practices – are held up against his depiction of coffee-houses as relatively contained and egalitarian spaces of calm rational-critical debate. Theoretical work is combined with a re-reading of Habermas’s own fragmentary notes on the coffee-house, together with some borrowings from both secondary texts and republished primary sources. The chief aim is to develop critical materials to inform further inquiry into coffee-houses and similar establishments, past and present, as sites for the practical conduct of public life...|$|R
60|$|It was {{a strange}} drive. For Denham it was without {{exception}} the most unpleasant he had ever taken. His only wish was to go as straightly and quickly as possible to Cheyne Walk; but it soon appeared that Mrs. Hilbery either ignored or thought fit to baffle this desire by interposing various errands of her own. She stopped the carriage at post-offices, and <b>coffee-shops,</b> and shops of inscrutable dignity where the aged attendants had to be greeted as old friends; and, catching sight of the dome of St. Paul's above the irregular spires of Ludgate Hill, she pulled the cord impulsively, and gave directions that Anderson should drive them there. But Anderson had reasons of his own for discouraging afternoon worship, and kept his horse's nose obstinately towards the west. After some minutes, Mrs. Hilbery realized the situation, and accepted it good-humoredly, apologizing to Ralph for his disappointment.|$|R
