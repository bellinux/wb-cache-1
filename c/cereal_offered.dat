40|$|Maize, {{the leading}} world <b>cereal,</b> <b>offers</b> the {{greatest}} potential for increasing food productivity in countries like Pakistan. The average yield in Pakistan is low compared to the world average. An effective short term strategy to improve maize productivity is to replace the local low yielding varieties and landraces with high yielding hybrids. However, mainly due to very high cost of the imported hybrid seed in Pakistan, the hybrid technology has not been adopted on larger scales. Currently, 25 % of the maize area is under hybrids in Pakistan. Therefore, {{there is a great}} need to develop, popularize and adopt maize hybrids with indigenous blood. Indigenous hybrids for agro-ecological zones not attended by the private multinational have been developed at National Agricultural Research Centre and tested in the respective ecologies. Six selected indigenous hybrids (NARC- 2701, NARC- 2702, NARC- 2703, NARC- 2704, NARC- 2705, NARC- 2707) were evaluated at two location during spring season. Four leading commercial hybrids (Bemisal- 202, 3335, 2303 and 6525 from Engro, Pioneer, Rafhan and Monsanto) were used as checks for comparison. Some of the indigenously developed hybrids (NARC- 2702, NARC- 2703, NARC- 2704, NARC- 2705) performed better than, or as good as their exotic counterparts. These hybrids exhibited desired idiotypes as indicated by plant and ear heights. The indigenous hybrids were earlier in maturity than the commercial checks.

40|$|Abstract. Forage <b>cereals</b> <b>offer</b> the {{potential}} {{to increase the amount}} of forage grown and consumed on dairy farms in southern Australia. The effect of single or multiple grazing of winter cereal forages by lactating dairy cattle on dry matter (DM) yield and nutritive value at grazing and on subsequent silage production harvested at the soft-dough stage of growth was determined in three studies in south-western Victoria. In the first two studies, a range of forage cereals and an annual ryegrass were grazed either once (G 1) during tillering (GS 21 – 29), followed by locking up for silage, grazed twice (G 2) (GS 21 – 29 and GS 32 – 34), followed by locking up for silage, or not grazed (NG) and harvested for silage only. In the third study, two forage cerealswere either ungrazed (NG) or grazed at eitherGS 21,GS 24,GS 30 orGS 32 and subsequently locked up and harvested for silage. All silage harvests occurred at GS 84 (soft dough). In all studies, grazing at early tillering resulted inDMyieldof less than 1. 4 tDM/ha, although crudeprotein (CP) (30 – 37 %DM) andestimatedmetabolisable energy (ME) (12. 2 – 14 MJ/kg DM) were high. Deferring grazing until the start of stem elongation resulted in higher DM yields (1. 8 – 4. 3 t DM/ha). Silage DM yields were higher (P < 0. 05) for G 1 and NG treatments than for G 2 in all cases apart from McKellarwheat in study 1. At silageharvest,CPandestimatedMEcontents of cerealswere lower than for annual ryegrass. In general, total DM yields across the growing season were higher for the G 1 and NG treatments compared with forages that were grazed twice before silage harvest. Deferment of a single grazing from early tillering to stem elongation did not adversely affect total DMproduction. However, delaying grazing until stem elongation resulted in significant declines in C...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cereals</b> <b>offer</b> {{advantages}} for molecular farming because seeds have naturally evolved for protein storage. In seeds, the recombinant proteins can be targeted to storage organelles, such as Protein Bodies (PBs) {{derived from the}} endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Protein Storage Vacuoles (PSVs) for stable accumulation and storage. Gamma-zein, the maize prolamin storage protein, and partial sequences thereof can be fused to proteins of interest to induce the formation of novel PB-like organelles not only in its native environment (maize endosperm) but also in other plant cells and in eukaryotic cells generally. We report the constitutive expression of recombinant fusion protein i. e. repeated and Pro-X domain of gamma-Zein and red fluorescent protein (DsRed) in transgenic wheat plants. The red fluorescent protein (DsRed) was used as tool for tracking subcellular localization of recombinant proteins and also as fluorescent selection marker to monitor transgene expression during wheat transformation. In the present study we explored endogenous and ectopically induced protein storage organelles as preferred intracellular destination for recombinant protein in wheat different tissues i. e. leaf, endosperm and embryo. Our finding has confirmed that the model fusion protein has induced {{the formation of an}} additional population of protein bodies containing the recombinant protein in seed and vegetative tissues. To better understand the trafficking of recombinant proteins in ectopic tissues, the subcellular localization of recombinant proteins in seed and green tissues were examined. We confirmed the feasibility of using γ-Zein for targeting recombinant protein into artificial protein bodies those were preferably retained in the protein storage vacuoles (PSV) in seed tissues. In vegetative tissues, the induced protein bodies were found highly mobile organelles, exhibiting different pattern of movement with no specific direction. The presence of the model fusion protein was validated in all three transgenic wheat plant tissues tested. Also, no degradation products were detected in transgenic wheat seeds after five months storage. The expression of recombinant fusion proteins had no harmful effect on the viability and development of transgenic wheat plants...|$|R
40|$|Background: Poor {{micronutrient}} {{status is}} reported among adolescents across Europe and USA. This {{may be related}} to the well-documented decline in the regular consumption of breakfast by this group. The regular consumption of a breakfast <b>cereal</b> <b>offers</b> a possible means to improve micronutrient status; fortified cereal is likely to have enhanced benefit. A study was conducted to determine the efficacy of the regular consumption of a fortified cereal with milk, compared with unfortified cereal, consumed either as a breakfast or a supper, in improving micronutrient intake and micronutrient status of adolescent girls. Methods: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention trial was conducted in girls recruited at ages 16 – 19 years, from schools and colleges in Sheffield, UK. Girls were randomised to receive 50 g fortified or unfortified cereal, with 150 ml semi-skimmed milk, daily, for 12 weeks, as a breakfast or as a supper. Dietary intake was estimated using a 4 -d food diary and blood collected for the assessment of nutritional status. Within-group changes were tested using a paired sample t test; two-way ANOVA was used to analyse effects of the intervention, with cereal type and time of consumption as factors, correcting for baseline values. The analysis was conducted on 71 girls who completed the study. Results: Consumption of unfortified cereal elicited an increase in the intake of vitamins B 1, B 2 and B 6; consumption of fortified cereal elicited increases in vitamins B 1, B 2, B 6, B 12, folate and iron (P[*]<[*] 0. 001) and of vitamin D (P[*]=[*] 0. 007), all increases were significantly greater than for unfortified cereal. Consumption of the fortified cereal also led to a significant improvement in biomarkers of status for vitamins B 2, B 12, folate and of iron, compared with girls receiving the unfortified cereal, and maintained vitamin D status, in contrast with the girls receiving the unfortified cereal (P[*]<[*] 0. 001). Conclusions: The daily consumption of cereal with milk for 12 weeks by adolescent girls, increased intakes of micronutrients. The consumption of fortified cereal elicited greater increases than for unfortified cereal and improved biomarkers of micronutrient status. The findings justify strategies to encourage the consumption of fortified cereal with milk by adolescents, either as a breakfast or a supper...|$|R
40|$|Cereal {{endosperm}} is a highly-differentiated tissue containing specialized organelles for {{the accumulation}} of storage proteins, which are ultimately deposited either within protein bodies derived from the endoplasmic reticulum, or in protein storage vacuoles (PSVs). During seed maturation endosperm cells undergo a rapid sequence of developmental changes, including extensive reorganization and rearrangement of the endomembrane system and protein transport via several developmentally-regulated trafficking routes. Storage organelles have been characterized in great detail by the histochemical analysis of fixed immature tissue samples. More recently, in vivo imaging {{and the use of}} tonoplast markers and fluorescent organelle tracers have provided further insight into the dynamic morphology of PSVs in different cell layers of the developing endosperm. This is relevant for biotechnological applications in the area of molecular farming because seed storage organelles in different <b>cereal</b> crops <b>offer</b> alternative subcellular destinations for the deposition of recombinant proteins that can reduce proteolytic degradation, allow control over glycan structures and increase the efficacy of oral delivery. We discuss how the specialized architecture and developmental changes of the endomembrane system in endosperm cells may influence the subcellular fate and post-translational modification of recombinant glycoproteins in different cereal species...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} decades Denmark has {{experienced}} a growing interest in low-input farming systems like organic farming. These systems rely on a high soil fertility to maintain nutrient availability and plant health. Soil aggregation contributes to this fertility, because {{it is crucial to}} soil porosity, aeration and infiltration of water. This paper reports a study of two pairs of differently managed, neighboring fields. The aim was to elucidate long-term effects of the different farming systems on physical and biological variables with influence on bonding and binding mechanisms of soil aggregation. Each pair consists of an organically grown dairy farm soil, based on a forage crop rotation system, including grass (Org-FCS(G)) and a conventionally managed soil. One of the conventional farms has a forage crop rotation with annual cash crops and no grass (Conv-FCS(NG)) and one has been grown continuously with small grain cereals and rape (Conv-CCS). Our results indicate that the Org-FCS(G) soils stimulate biotic soil aggregating agents as measured by extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) and hyphal length measurements, respectively. Generally, the Conv-CCS soil, which relies exclusively on synthetic fertilisers and <b>cereal</b> production, <b>offered</b> poor conditions for the biotic binding and bonding agents. Nevertheless this soil contained a large amount of stable macro-aggregates. This is explained by the physical results, which indicated that the strong macro-aggregation was due to clay dispersion and cementation processes rather than to biotic processes...|$|R
40|$|In {{the twenty-first}} century, {{it is evident}} that world {{agricultural}} systems will have to supply sufficient food for a population somewhere between 7. 5 and 12 billion. Projections for world agriculture {{in the first half of}} the twenty-first century very widely, largely depending on assumptions about yield growth. An investigation of the patterns of yield growth for major <b>cereal</b> crops <b>offers</b> evidence that the pattern is logistic, implying that an upper limit to yields is being approached. This pattern is consistent with ecological limits on soil fertility, water availability, and nutrient uptake. It is also evident that current agricultural production is imposing serious strains on ecosystems, with widespread soil degradation, water overdraft and pollution, and ecological impacts such as loss of biodiversity and the proliferation of resistant pest species. The issue therefore is not simply the balance of supply and demand in agriculture. It is the need to develop ecologically sustainable agricultural systems which can provide an agricultural output about twice present aggregate levels (allowing for per capita growth in consumption). This level of output would support a population of about 8 billion. In addition, a population policy which can avert any much higher growth is essential. Evidence exists to show that ecologically sustainable cropping systems can supply overall outputs comparable to intensive high-input agriculture.

40|$|Annual and {{perennial}} habit are {{two major}} strategies by which grasses adapt to seasonal environmental change, and these distinguish cultivated cereals from their wild relatives. Rhizomatousness, a key trait contributing to perenniality, was investigated by using an F 2 population from a cross between cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) and its wild relative, Oryza longistaminata. Molecular mapping based on a complete simple sequence-repeat map revealed two dominant-complementary genes controlling rhizomatousness. Rhz 3 was mapped to the interval between markers OSR 16 [1. 3 centimorgans (cM) ] and OSR 13 (8. 1 cM) on rice chromosome 4 and Rhz 2 located between RM 119 (2. 2 cM) and RM 273 (7. 4 cM) on chromosome 3. Comparative mapping indicated that each gene closely corresponds to major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling rhizomatousness in Sorghum propinquum, a wild relative of cultivated sorghum. Correspondence of these genes in rice and sorghum, which diverged from a common ancestor ≈ 50 million years ago, suggests that the two genes may be key regulators of rhizome development in many Poaceae. Many additional QTLs affecting abundance of rhizomes in O. longistaminata were identified, most of which also corresponded to the locations of S. propinquum QTLs. Convergent evolution of independent mutations at, in some cases, corresponding genes may {{have been responsible for}} the evolution of annual cereals from perennial wild grasses.

Cereal crops grown in these mixtures tend to accumulate more protein in their grain. At the same time they extend their growing season. The traditional oat production system in Poland is based on covered oats grown with vetch on poor and damp soils. Our objective was to determine the grain yield and quality of a naked oat cultivar grown as a pure crop and with a spring vetch companion crop. The field experiment was conducted at the Czyrna Experimental Station from 1999 to 2002. The naked oat cv. Akt was sown either as a pure crop or with spring vetch determinate cv. Ina at two seed rates. The amount of rainfall over the experimental years varied from 737 to 1040 mm, corresponding with the multiannual average of 834 mm. The effect of graded seed rates of spring vetch on yield and gross chemical composition of naked oat grain (AOAC, 1995) and ?-glucans content (the Megazyme assay kit no 995. 16) were determined. The present results confirm earlier findings indicating that total yields of wheat and triticale grown with legume companion plants were decreased with decreasing cereal seeding rates (Pisulewska, 1997). Cereal grain protein content was increased with increasing seeding rates of legume companions. We confirmed the negative relationship between oat grain protein and fat content, while ash and ?-glucans were only little, although significantly affected. In conclusion, the relative changes in grain yield and quality of naked oat grown either as a pure crop or with a spring vetch companion plant, were similar to those observed for wheat and triticale.

Members {{of the family}} Poaceae are of particular importance both in food security and for their applications as biofuel substrates. For centuries, rust fungi have threatened the production of valuable crops such as wheat, barley, oat and other small grains; similarly, biofuel crops can also be susceptible to these pathogens. Emerging rust pathogenic races with increased virulence and recurrent rust epidemics around the world point out the vulnerability of monocultures.

Eight flavours used historically as flavourants were presented to eight horses maintained at pasture, at 1 % in standard meals of 100 g cereal by-product. Diet acceptance, selection and consumption times were recorded. A Latin Square design was used to control for order effects. Before data collection, two meals of 100 g of base diet (a standard <b>cereal</b> by-product) were <b>offered,</b> at the usual meal times, to approximate standard hunger levels. For the trial, horses were brought into individual familiar stables. Meals were offered in door mounted mangers, each used exclusively for that flavour to avoid residual effects. A minimum of one hour separated the meals which were terminated following complete consumption or no further interest for two minutes. Times for either; Complete consumption; Partial rejection (food partly consumed but then ignored for 2 minutes) or Total rejection were recorded. Any diet remaining was reweighed. Mean consumption times were compared using Kendall’s coefficient of concordance. Variation in amount consumed was compared for all eight flavours using Kendall’s coefficient of concordance. This showed a significant difference existed between amount consumed (W = 0. 314, n = 8, p < 0. 01). Mean time to consumption or rejection was affected by individual variation and were NS for the group overall. The most accepted flavour by weight consumed was Agrimony (mean rank 2. 81). The least preferred flavour was Elecampagne (mean rank 6. 56). This trial showed flavour concentrations of 1 % in a standard base diet significantly affected diet selection and acceptance, but not consumption times of pastured horses. These results may have practical implications in diet formulation for pastured horses...|$|R

For Dan Brown of Blue Hill, Maine, that splash of dairy in his coffee mug is the result of his personal labor and constant, meticulous attention paid to {{the health and well-being of}} a single 1, 000 pound mammal. Besides fresh raw milk, what does Brown gain from his efforts? He knows the exact source of the milk he puts in his coffee, as well as the butter his daughter spreads on her toast: Sprocket, Brown’s sole dairy cow. However, Sprocket has garnered Brown some wanted attention recently, earning her a new moniker: “Troublemaker. ” Whatever dairy Sprocket produces that does not end up in Brown’s family’s coffee or <b>cereal,</b> Dan Brown <b>offers</b> for sale directly from his farm, Gravelwood Farm, or at local farmers’ markets in towns of Blue Hill and nearby Ellsworth. These sales, “which net Brown roughly 8, 2 ̆ 2 gained the attention of the Maine Department of Agriculture (“the Department”). The Department, noting that Brown was not properly licensed as either a milk distributor or food establishment, advised him that he was not in compliance with state law and demanded that he cease the sale of all food products until he complied with licensing requirements, or otherwise face legal action. Furthermore, having previously taken samples from Brown’s raw whole milk, butter, and cottage cheese, the Department claimed that his dairy products “failed to meet established standards for quality and safety,” and that Brown was “exposing consumers to serious health risks. ” Despite these demands and threats of legal action, Brown continued to sell his food products without a Department license recognizing him as an authorized distributor or food establishment...|$|R
40|$|Dissertação (mestrado) - Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Centro de Ciências da Saúde, Programa de Pós-Graduação em Nutrição, Florianópolis, 2014 Ambiente alimentar caracteriza-se pela acessibilidade aos alimentos e bebidas aos indivíduos. Ambientes com maior disponibilidade e acesso a alimentos mais saudáveis, exercem maior influência nas escolhas alimentares, facilitando o consumo destes alimentos. Pelo fato de estudantes frequentarem a universidade por vários anos, os alimentos e bebidas comercializados neste ambiente e arredor, podem influenciar na qualidade da sua alimentação. Nesse sentido, o objetivo do presente estudo foi caracterizar o ambiente alimentar do campus sede de uma universidade pública da região sul do Brasil, identificando a qualidade alimentar e nutricional, tipos e preços dos alimentos e bebidas comercializados nas lanchonetes e restaurantes do campus. A coleta de dados foi realizada nos meses de outubro e novembro de 2013, por meio de um censo dos estabelecimentos situados no campus sede da universidade, totalizando 13 lanchonetes e seis restaurantes. Os instrumentos utilizados para a coleta de dados foram o Nutrition Environment Measures Survey - Restaurants (NEMS-R), traduzido para o português e adaptado para o Brasil para ser aplicado em restaurantes e similares com diferentes tipos de serviço, e um formulário para complementar os dados nas lanchonetes. Houve aprovação prévia pelo Comitê de Ética em Pesquisa com Seres Humanos com consentimento de todos os responsáveis pelos estabelecimentos avaliados, bem como do órgão que regulamenta os serviços prestados por estes estabelecimentos na universidade analisada. Cerca de 16 % disponibilizavam informação alimentar ou nutricional, o apelo para opções saudáveis, considerado um facilitador para promoção de alimentação saudável era praticado por apenas um restaurante e 92. 3 % das lanchonetes ofereciam porções reduzidas. Entre as lanchonetes, 23 % comercializavam ofertas combinadas de alimentos e bebidas por um preço único. Quanto aos restaurantes, a mediana do preço por peso da refeição foi R$ 20. 80 por quilo, enquanto os restaurantes da universidade serviam refeição completa ao preço fixo de R$ 1, 50 para estudantes. Metade destes ofertavam fruta in natura como sobremesa e café sem adição de açúcar aos clientes, gratuitamente. Cerca de 67 % destes locais disponibilizavam cereais integrais no bufê; 83 % ofereciam carne vermelha assada, cozida ou chapeada, 50 % carne branca frita e 50 % carne branca não frita; 100 % dispunham de saladas sem molhos adicionados e leguminosas sem embutidos. Nas lanchonetes, os salgados assados refinados e integrais eram comercializados em todas, enquanto os salgados fritos de massa refinada estavam em 69 % das lanchonetes. Os recheios mais evidenciados nos salgados comercializados eram compostos por carne vermelha e embutidos (100 % das lanchonetes). Os bolos de massa refinada com recheio e/ou cobertura eram os comercializados em um maior número de opções (média de 3 opções). Os sanduíches com carne vermelha eram os mais encontrados nas 12 lanchonetes que comercializam esta categoria de alimento, nas versões {{integral}} e refinada, sendo o sanduíche de carne vermelha no pão refinado o mais barato. Não foi encontrada fruta in natura nas lanchonetes analisadas, apenas salada de frutas em 11 delas. Dentre a variedade de bebidas comercializada, o suco natural de fruta era a única bebida ofertada por todas as 13 lanchonetes. No entanto, ao comparar os preços de opções com menor e maior qualidade alimentar e nutricional, constatou-se nas lanchonetes que as opções de menor qualidade alimentar e nutricional apresentaram menor preço em relação às opções de melhor qualidade. Estas diferenças de preço foram significativas entre o chá industrializado e o chá infusão preparado na lanchonete (p Abstract: Food {{environment is}} characterized by the accessibility to food and beverages by individuals. Environments with greater availability and access to healthier food influence more on food choices, facilitating the consumption of these foods. Because of the fact that students attend the university for many years, the food and beverages sold in this environment and surroundings can influence the quality of feeding. Accordingly, the goal {{of the present study was}} to characterize the food environment of the head office of a public university in the south region of Brazil, identifying the food and nutritional quality, types and prices of food and beverages sold in the campus cafeterias and restaurants. The data collection was performed during the months of October and November of 2013, by a census of establishments placed in the head campus of the university, adding up to 13 cafeterias and 6 restaurants. The instruments used for the data collection were the Nutrition Environment Measures Survey - Restaurants (NEMS-R), translated to Portuguese and adapted to Brazil to be applied in restaurants and similar with different types of services, and a form to complement the data in cafeterias. There was preview approval by the Ethics comity in research with human beings with consent of all the responsible for the establishments in the analyzed university. About 16 % displayed food or nutritional information, the appeal for healthier choices, considered a facilitator for the promotion of healthy feeding was practiced by 1 restaurant and 92, 3 % of the cafeterias offered reduced portions. Among the cafeterias, 23 % sold offers combined of food and beverages for a single price. As for the restaurants, the average price for weight of food was R$ 20, 80 for kilo, while the restaurants of the university served a complete meal for the fixed price of s for the restaurants, the average price for weight of food was R$ 20, 80 for kilo, while the restaurants of the university served a complete meal for the fixed price of R$ 1, 50 for students. Half of these offered fruits in natura as a desert and coffee without sugar to clients, for free. About 67 % of these places had whole cereals in the buffet; 83 % offered roasted, grilled or boiled red meat; 50 % fried white meat and 50 % white meat not fried; 100 % had salads without added dressings and legumes without sausages. In the cafeterias, the refined baked salted goods and the whole salted goods were sold in all, while the fried refined salted goods sold were made of red meat and sausages (100 % of the cafeterias). The refined mixed cakes with filling and/or icing were sold in a higher number of options (average of 3 options). The sandwiches with red meat were the most found in the 12 cafeterias that sold this category of food, the versions whole and refined, the red meat with refined bread being the cheapest. Fruits in natura were not found in the analyzed cafeteria, just fruit salads in 11 of them. Among the variety of beverages sold, the natural juice was the only beverage sold by all the 13 cafeterias. However, when comparing the prices of options with less and high food and nutritional quality, it was found that the cafeterias that the options of less nutritional and food quality showed lower prices when compared to the options of better quality. These differences of price were significant between an industrialized tea and an infused tea prepared in the cafeteria (p< 0, 001), as well as the difference between the price of a refined fried salted good and a baked whole salted good (p< 0, 001), and among the refined cookie without filling and the whole cookie without filling (p= 0. 028). In the restaurants, the soda showed higher prices than the natural fruit juice (p< 0, 001). The food environment of the campus analyzed can improve the options available to incentive and ease the healthier food choices, since the elevated offer of products with lower food and nutritional quality are cheaper. The restaurants have a high offer of vegetables, fruits and legumes. However, the thin meats were prepared with techniques that increased the fat percentage; the <b>offer</b> of whole <b>cereals</b> was not made in every place; and many refined <b>cereals</b> were <b>offered,</b> with low percentage of fiber and high of fat. A vast offer of products of low food and nutritional quality were found in the cafeterias, such as salted goods, hot sweets, cakes, cookies and sandwiches prepared with refined flour, stuffed with ingredients containing high levels of sugar and fat. Also, the beverages, the salted goods and the hot sweets, and the healthier cookies were more expensive than the rest. The possibility and the necessity of improving food and nutritional quality of the products sold in the studied campus, having seen the number of students and servers that attend these environments for many hours of the day and during many years of their lives is fundamental...|$|R
