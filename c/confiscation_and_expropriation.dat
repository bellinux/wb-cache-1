40|$|The {{topic of}} my thesis is "Land reform during the First Republic", which {{proceeded}} {{in our state}} from the year 1919 till the year 1935. The land reform contained {{an element of the}} <b>confiscation</b> <b>and</b> <b>expropriation,</b> so I integrated in the introduction of my thesis the explanation and short overview of process and history of these two institutes, which represent the most important intervention of the states to the landed property. After that I focused on the alterations of the lands, their history and importance. The main part of my thesis deals with the land reform, especially the preconditions and the reasons, why our state decided to carry out so important and forward change of the landed property and different conceptions and views of the political parties. The next part of my thesis is focused on the laws, which deal with main problems and issues of the land reform, and on the pursuance of the land reform in practice. I didn't miss out include in my thesis neither results of this reform nor the criticism and appreciation of this reform. In my opinion this reform poses important component of the coup {{and one of the most}} important tasks, which the new independent state had to fulfil to stabilize the internal situation in the land...|$|E

Section 527 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act (1994) prohibits certain U.S. assistance {{and support for}} a government {{of a country that}} has confiscated U.S. citizen property, unless the government has taken certain remedial steps. In July 2007, the Secretary of State issued a 14th annual national interest waiver of the Section 527 prohibition because of Nicaragua's record in resolving U.S. citizen claims as well as its overall progress in implementing political and economic reforms.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} {{a growing concern}} among foreign investors about the laws and policies concerning foreign investment in Quebec and Canada. This thesis focuses on the laws that affect non Canadians doing business in Canada and Quebec. The introduction deals {{with the history of}} the policies concerning foreign ownership in Quebec and Canada. Section two analyzes the juridical personality of foreigners. Thereafter, this thesis will study the different implications for aliens acquiring moveables or immoveables in Quebec. This writer will analyze the legislative provisions and policies concerning foreign investment that are enacted by {{the federal government and the}} provincial government. A survey of the extraterritoriality of Antitrust laws and the international approach of settling the problems of <b>confiscation,</b> <b>expropriation</b> <b>and</b> nationalization follows. This thesis will briefly examine the Provincial legislation in immigration. Finally, the conclusion attempts to offer an alternative to the solutions arrived at by the federal and the provincial government of Quebec. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

40|$|Ethiopia has {{experimented with}} land law reforms linked to agriculture-led {{national}} development strategies that Emperor Haile Sellassie I, Derg, and EPRDF introduced since Emperor Menelik II enacted modern Ethiopia’s first reform intended for development in 1908. Nonetheless, the country’s smallholder productivity averaged 1. 0 ton/hectare and its poverty ranked 174 th in the UNDP Human Development Index in 2011. This thesis examines {{whether and how}} land law reform {{can be used to}} help raise smallholder productivity and tackle poverty in Ethiopia notwithstanding the challenges of legal pluralism. By drawing upon evidence from law and development research and experience and analysing it in the Ethiopian context, the thesis argues that reform can help raise smallholder productivity, but only by recognising legal pluralism and changing the land tenure system’s formal state or non-formal customary land policies, laws, and institutions which constrain the provision and implementation of productivity-raising smallholder land rights that enhance tenure security, facilitate the transfer of rights over land, and authorise the collateralisation of land rights; and tackle poverty by thereby increasing food supplies, raising incomes, and improving health, education, and other necessities for the country’s predominantly rural population. Specifically, the thesis explores the possibility of using reform to adopt a hybrid state-private-customary land policy that combines the advantages of state land ownership policy that the government enforces, private ownership that critics favour, and non-formal arrangements that society uses. It then highlights how within the framework of this hybrid policy reform may help issue land laws boosting the provision of land rights that enhance tenure security by specifying definition of state, private, and communal landholdings, certification of lifelong usufructuary landholding, stricter eviction <b>and</b> <b>confiscation</b> procedures, <b>and</b> clearer <b>expropriation</b> <b>and</b> compensation mechanisms; that facilitate transfer by easing lease, donation, and succession restrictions; and that authorise collateralisation conditionally. Finally, it demonstrates how reform may help establish land institutions that improve implementation by incorporating non-formal arrangements, establishing a federal executive institution, clarifying the mandates of regional institutions, and assigning the judiciary greater dispute resolution role...|$|R

40|$|Over the years, {{much has}} been written {{concerning}} the taking of property by the state through <b>confiscation,</b> <b>expropriation,</b> <b>and</b> more generally nationalization from an international law point of view. By contrast, there is a dearth of authority on the subject of denationalization, or privatization as it is called today. The rolling back of nationalization that first took hold in Britain a few years ago has gained momentum as Canada and France have decided to return many state-owned enterprises to the private sector. The objective is clear, but the methods to accomplish it are not uniform, nor is it certain that all states concerned desire to achieve popular capitalism. Thus, foreign multinational corporations as well as institutional investors may be interested in acquiring these state owned enterprises. This possibility {{raises the question of whether}} they will be given an opportunity to do so, as the privatizing law may forbid or limit foreign ownership. Furthermore, a question of valuation arises. In this connection can state-owned enterprises be sold at less than their value, especially to foreign purchasers? Does international law have anything to say concerning these matters? In other words, should there be a parallel between nationalization and privatization? Are there any international treaties that are applicable? Antitrust issues may also be involved where the state-owned enterprise to be sold has a complete monopoly or is in a position to abuse its dominant market position once it is deregulated. Another issue is whether approval of the sale to foreign investors must be obtained, in other words whether, in Canada, for instance, the procedures found in the Investment Canada Act must be followed. What is the situation if the state-owned enterprise has foreign subsidiaries...|$|R

However, on July 30, 1941 the Aktion Klostersturm (Operation Monastery) was put to an end by a decree of Hitler, who feared the increasing protests by the Catholic part of German population might result in passive rebellions and thereby harm the Nazi war effort at the eastern front. Over 300 monasteries and other institutions were expropriated by the SS.|$|R
