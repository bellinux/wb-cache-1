5|$|After {{the fall}} of Napoleon, {{not only was the}} Napoleonic Code {{retained}} by conquered countries including the Netherlands, Belgium, parts of Italy and Germany, but has been used as the basis of <b>certain</b> <b>parts</b> of law outside Europe including the Dominican Republic, the US state of Louisiana and the Canadian province of Quebec. The memory of Napoleon in Poland is favorable, for his support for independence and opposition to Russia, his legal code, the abolition of serfdom, and the introduction of modern middle class bureaucracies.|$|E
5|$|Along with Davis' {{other records}} during the 1970s, Dark Magus was {{received}} ambivalently by contemporary critics, but it inspired noise rock acts {{during the late}} 1970s and the experimental funk artists of the 1980s. The album was not released in the United States until July 1997, when it was reissued by Sony Records and Legacy Records. In retrospective reviews, critics praised its jazz-rock aesthetic and the group members' performances, and some believed <b>certain</b> <b>parts</b> foreshadowed jungle music.|$|E

5|$|The Condor Legion spearheaded many Nationalist victories, {{particularly}} providing air dominance from 1937 onwards; 300 air-to-air victories were claimed, {{although this}} was dwarfed by some 900 claimed by Italian forces. Spain provided a proving ground for German tank tactics, {{as well as}} aircraft tactics, the latter being only moderately successful. The air superiority which allowed <b>certain</b> <b>parts</b> of the Legion to excel would be replicated {{in the first year}} of World War II, until ultimately failing to prevail in the Battle of Britain.|$|E

This route {{has been used for}} {{smuggling}} subsidised goods from the town to <b>certain</b> <b>parts</b> in Indonesia, especially southern Sebatik, by Indonesian smugglers as this area is highly dependent on Tawau. Many Indonesians near the international border choose to seek medical treatment in the town due to the lower cost and better facilities, compared to other Indonesian towns.|$|E
5|$|Benicio del Toro had {{significant}} input into <b>certain</b> <b>parts</b> of the film; for example, he suggested a simpler, more concise way of depicting his character kidnapping Francisco Flores that Soderbergh ended up using. The director cut {{a scene in}} which Robert Wakefield smokes crack after finding it in his daughter's bedroom. After rehearsing this scene with the actors, he felt that the character would not do it; after consulting with Gaghan, the screenwriter agreed and the filmmakers cut the scene shortly before it was scheduled to be shot.|$|E

5|$|Croatian Serb forces turned Ovčara into {{a prison}} camp in early October 1991. Aside from the massacre, 3,000–4,000 male prisoners were {{temporarily}} {{held in the}} Ovčara camp {{at some point during}} autumn of 1991 before being transported to the prison in Sremska Mitrovica or to the local JNA barracks, which was the transit point for Serbian detention camps such as Stajićevo and Begejci. Following a series of political agreements concluded in 1991 and a ceasefire between the JNA and Croatia in early 1992, the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) was deployed for peacekeeping in <b>certain</b> <b>parts</b> of Croatia, including Vukovar and its surroundings. It began its deployment in March 1992.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{southeast}} Asian jungle cats {{still used}} to be the most common wild cats near villages in <b>certain</b> <b>parts</b> of northern Thailand and occurred in many protected areas of the country. However, since the early 1990s, jungle cats are rarely encountered and have suffered drastic declines due to hunting and habitat destruction. Today, their official status in the country is critically endangered. In Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, jungle cats have been subject to extensive hunting. Skins are occasionally recorded in border markets, and live individuals, possibly taken from Myanmar or Cambodia, occasionally turn up in the Khao Khieo and Chiang Mai zoos of Thailand.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the game's release, several {{trailers}} {{were released}} for it, detailing its development progress and the improvements in <b>certain</b> <b>parts</b> of the game. The game also had three pre-order tiers, each coming with different amounts of in-game content. A public beta {{for the game}} was initiated prior to the game's release for testing. It contained the HUT, EASHL and Online Versus modes {{as well as the}} Creation Zone. Critics who played the beta wrote generally positive reviews and noted it as a good precursor to the full game. Upon its release, NHL 17 received generally positive reviews from critics. The gameplay improvements and new additions to the game mainly received praise, while criticism was aimed at some lack of depth and general innovation.|$|E

On 23 July 1855 the London Necropolis & National Mausoleum Amendment Act 1855 received Royal Assent. This Act released the LNC from those compulsory purchases of land which had been mandated by the 1852 Act but {{had not yet been}} completed, easing the immediate financial burden. It also allowed a ten-year window for the LNC to sell <b>certain</b> <b>parts</b> of the land bought from Lord Onslow which were not required for the cemetery, to provide a source of income.|$|E
5|$|Sakura {{has become}} the series' female lead, although, she was not {{immediately}} intended for the role. Kishimoto has had difficulty drawing her character resulting in Kishimoto inadvertently emphasizing <b>certain</b> <b>parts</b> of her appearance, including her large forehead. In {{order to make the}} character more appealing {{in the second part of}} the series, Kishimoto designed her costume to make her look more like a martial artist as well as more beautiful during later chapters. Chie Nakamura voices the character in the animated adaptations of the series, while Kate Higgins plays her in the English dub.|$|E
5|$|The Asiatic dayflower is {{considered}} a weed both in areas where it was introduced and in <b>certain</b> <b>parts</b> of its native range. The flowers' interactions with pollinators have been well studied and have helped to support important hypotheses about pollination {{in the field of}} plant ecology. Recent research has also revealed that the Asiatic dayflower can bioaccumulate a number of metals, making it a candidate for revegetating and essentially cleaning spoiled copper mines. Several animals and fungi use the plant as a food source, with a few species feeding upon it exclusively.|$|E

5|$|The addax live {{in desert}} terrain where they eat grasses and leaves of what shrubs, leguminous herbs and bushes are available. Primarily grazers, their staple foods include Aristida, Panicum, and Stipagrostis, {{and they will}} only consume browse, such as leaves of Acacia trees {{in the absence of}} these grasses. Perennials which turn green and sprout at the {{slightest}} bit of humidity or rain. The addax eat only <b>certain</b> <b>parts</b> of the plant and tend to crop the Aristida grasses neatly to the same height. By contrast, when feeding on Panicum grass, the drier outer leaves are left alone while they eat the tender, inner shoots and seeds. These seeds are important part of the addax diet, being their main source of protein.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} ovoviviparous, with females {{giving birth to}} one to 16 live young and {{possibly}} as many as 20. However, litters of six to eight are the most common. Neonates are 22–35cm in length (excluding runts), with the largest being A. p. conanti and A. p. leucostoma the smallest. If weather conditions are favorable and food is readily available, growth is rapid and females may reproduce at {{less than three years}} of age and a total length of as little as 60cm. The young are born in August or September, while mating may occur during any of the warmer months of the year, at least in <b>certain</b> <b>parts</b> of its range.|$|E
5|$|A dun-colored {{coat with}} {{primitive}} markings {{that include a}} dorsal stripe and often leg striping and transverse shoulder stripes reflect the wildtype coat and are observed in most wild extant equine species. Only the mountain zebra lacks a dorsal stripe. In domestic horses, dun color and primitive markings exist in some animals across many breeds. The purpose of the bold black-and-white striping of zebras has been a subject of debate among biologists for over a century, but recent (2014) evidence supports the theory {{that they are a}} form of protection from biting flies. These insects appear to be less attracted to striped coats and, compared to other wild equines, zebras live in areas with the highest fly activity. With the exception of the domestic horses, which have long manes that lay over the neck and long tail hair growing {{from the top of the}} tailhead or dock, most equines have erect manes and long tails ending in a tuft of hair. The coats of some equine species undergo shedding in <b>certain</b> <b>parts</b> of their range and are thick in the winter.|$|E
