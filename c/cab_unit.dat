25|$|ALCO PA {{refers to}} a family of A1A-A1A diesel {{locomotives}} built to haul passenger trains that were built in Schenectady, New York, in the United States by a partnership of the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) and General Electric (GE) between June, 1946 and December, 1953. They were of a <b>cab</b> <b>unit</b> design, and both cab-equipped lead A unit PA and cabless booster B unit PB models were built.|$|E
25|$|The ALCO FA was {{a family}} of B-B diesel {{locomotives}} designed to haul freight trains. The locomotives were built by a partnership of ALCO and General Electric in Schenectady, New York, between January 1946 and May 1959. They were of a <b>cab</b> <b>unit</b> design, and both cab-equipped lead (A unit) FA and cabless booster (B unit) FB models were built. A dual passenger-freight version, the FPA/FPB, was also offered. It was equipped with a steam generator for heating passenger cars.|$|E
25|$|Garratts {{enjoy an}} {{advantage}} over the Mallet system, because of the geometry of the design. When swinging around curves the boiler and <b>cab</b> <b>unit</b> move inward like a bowstring in the bow of a curve and this reduces the centrifugal force that would overturn a normal locomotive and which in turn permits faster running. The Mallet's forward articulated unit tends to throw out as the loco rounds curves. While most Garratts were designed for freight or mixed traffic, there were several passenger Garratt classes. A Garratt holds the world speed record for an articulated locomotive.|$|E
50|$|They were {{replaced}} by American Locomotive Company (ALCO) PA-1 <b>cab</b> <b>units</b> and PB-1 booster units and General Motors Electro-Motive Division (EMD) E7A <b>cab</b> <b>units</b> and E7B booster units diesel locomotives in two-shades of orange, later painted dark gray with red nose.|$|R
50|$|The former {{arrangement}} {{is now the}} norm in North America {{for all types of}} diesel or electric locomotives. In Europe, most modern locomotives are <b>cab</b> <b>units</b> with two <b>cabs,</b> one at each end. However, the locomotives powering some high speed European trains are normally <b>cab</b> <b>units</b> with one <b>cab,</b> and European shunting locomotives are usually hood units.|$|R
50|$|Southern Pacific Railroad bought ten high <b>cab</b> <b>units</b> with Type B road trucks.|$|R
25|$|Like {{most other}} {{commuter}} rail systems in North America, all trains are operated with a cab car {{from which the}} engineer can control the train. The cab car is typically {{at the head of}} trains traveling toward Washington to keep diesel fumes away from the terminal. To accommodate elevation gains, the locomotive is at the head of trains heading away from Washington. In the early 2000s a single unpowered EMD F <b>cab</b> <b>unit,</b> #7100 (ex-Baltimore & Ohio Railroad F7 #4553), occasionally substituted for a cab car. In addition to serving as a Non-Powered Control Unit, the unit is also outfitted with a head-end power generator to supply electricity to the train.|$|E
2500|$|... "A1A-3" [...] {{means there}} are two trucks. The [...] "A1A" [...] truck is under {{the front of the}} unit, and has one powered axle, one idler axle, and one more powered axle. The [...] "3" [...] truck is under the back of the unit, and has three idler axles in a row. An example is the Baldwin DR-6-2-10 [...] <b>cab</b> <b>unit,</b> only one of which was built for the Chicago and North Western Railway in 1948.|$|E
2500|$|The ALCO DL-109 {{is one of}} six {{models of}} A1A-A1A Diesel {{locomotives}} built to haul passenger trains by the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) between December, 1939 and April, 1945 ("DL" [...] stands for Diesel Locomotive). They were of a <b>cab</b> <b>unit</b> design, and both cab-equipped lead A units DL-103b, DL-105, DL-107, DL-109 and cabless booster B units DL-108, DL-110 models were built. The units were styled by noted industrial designer Otto Kuhler, who incorporated into his characteristic cab (US Patent D121,219) the trademark three-piece windshield design. A total of 74 cab units and four cabless booster units were built.|$|E

50|$|The LMS Diesels 10000 & 10001, later {{classified}} as British Rail Class D16/1, {{were introduced in}} 1947. These were Great Britain's first mainline diesel locomotives, coming about a decade after America's first <b>cab</b> <b>units.</b> Despite their streamlined exterior, they are actually cowl <b>units</b> rather than <b>cab</b> <b>units.</b> It is easy to misinterpret this as in North America, cowl designs are more angular, while cab designs have a similar curved streamlining.|$|R
2500|$|Orders for the C-liners were {{initially}} {{received from the}} New York Central, followed by the Long Island Rail Road, the Pennsylvania Railroad, the Milwaukee Road and the New Haven. Orders to the Canadian Locomotive Company were also forthcoming in Canada from the Canadian Pacific and Canadian National railways. However, accounts of mechanical unreliability and poor technical support soon began to emerge. It quickly {{became apparent that the}} [...] Westinghouse generators were prone to failure, and the F-M prime movers initially suffered from relatively poor piston life, usually due to cooling problems, and proved difficult to maintain. [...] Moreover, railroads were quickly moving away from <b>cab</b> <b>unit</b> designs, and standardizing on road-switcher designs, as offered by the competition {{in the form of the}} EMD GP7 or the ALCO RS-3.|$|E
2500|$|SEPTA Regional Rail's {{method of}} {{preventing}} slippery rail is the Gel Trains. These three trains spray a high-pressure mixture of Sandite on the rails; in the fall, the Gel Trains also clean the rails using the {{high-pressure water jet}} method ahead of the gel application. These trains consist of a pressure washer and gel dispenser mounted on a converted flatcar, and a tank car which carries water. They are pulled on one end by one of SEPTA's work diesels (or a diesel borrowed from a local shortline such as the West Chester Railroad), and controlled {{at the other end}} by a former LIRR [...] "Power Pack" [...] <b>cab</b> <b>unit</b> (one a former ALCO FA, the other a former EMD F7). However, as of 2015; The FA and F7 were retired and replaced by Comet 1 cab cars.|$|E
2500|$|From 1982 to 1984, Tokyu Car built 45 of a heavily-specialized, meter-gauge RDC {{design for}} the Taiwan Railway Administration under license from Budd. [...] Designated the DR2800 series, the units are {{organized}} into 15 permanently-coupled 3-car sets (30 powered driving cars and 15 trailers). [...] Like other RDC trainsets before them, each <b>cab</b> <b>unit</b> only has a cab {{at one end and}} two cab units bracket a trailer in a standard set. [...] Unlike other RDC sets, however, the trailer's diesel engine is used exclusively to provide head-end power for the entire 3-car set, while the engines in the driver car are used for propulsion. [...] To prevent dependency on the trailer's engine for cooling, the cooling fans of the driver cars are driven hydraulically instead of electrically. [...] This configuration results in each set producing 700HP for a top speed of 110km/h. [...] All 15 sets are still in service.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cab</b> <b>units</b> {{were not}} {{generally}} used in Great Britain. The traditional makers {{continued to use}} heavyweight frames and cowl units instead.|$|R
50|$|The China Railways DJ1 is a {{high power}} {{mainline}} electric freight locomotive built as a double locomotive unit of two nominally independent single <b>cab</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
50|$|Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway {{bought two}} medium <b>cab</b> <b>units</b> with Hi-Ad trucks; these were {{passed to the}} Burlington Northern Railroad after a merger between the two railroads.|$|R
2500|$|The FAs, as well {{as their}} cousins, the ALCO PAs, were born as a result of Alco's {{development}} of a new diesel engine design, the Model 244. [...] In early 1944, development started on the new design, and by November 1945, the first engines were beginning to undergo tests. [...] This unusually short testing sequence was brought about by the decision of Alco's senior management that the engine and an associated line of road locomotives had to be introduced no later than the end of 1946. [...] In preparation for this deadline, by January 1946, the first four locomotives with the 244 engines had been built. Two FA-1s and an FB-1 were painted in Alco Demonstrator colors and were released for road tests for {{a month and a half}} on the Delaware and Hudson Railway. A strike at Alco delayed production beyond the first four units and delivery of the first three ex-demonstrator units, to the Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad, began in mid February 1946. The remainder of the order began delivery in May 1946 and continued until April 1947 for a total of 80 units. [...] Before the end of this production run, Alco upgraded the generators and traction motors in the locomotives, with the first of these models entering service in February 1947 for the New York Central. [...] In 1950, the Montreal Locomotive Works, an affiliate of Alco, began production of FAs as well. [...] In the Fall of 1950, an upgraded model, the FA-2, was launched. [...] This model featured an uprated Model 244 engine, with an output of 1600 horsepower. [...] Additionally, the carbody was lengthened, making possible the addition of a steam generator in the A unit to allow for use in passenger service. [...] Models equipped as such were designated the FPA-2/FPB-2. [...] The first FA-2s were delivered in October 1950 to the Baltimore and Ohio and the Erie. [...] By this time, however, the <b>cab</b> <b>unit</b> had fallen out of favor due to the greater versatility of road switchers, and U S production of the FA line ended in 1956, with Canadian production ending in 1959. The MTA Long Island Rail Road purchased 20 units and removed the traction motors from the units. the LIRR used them to supply AC HEP (head end power) to the cars of the train. Also the engines were used as a cab when another engine was pushing on the east end of the train. By the late 1990s and early 2000s the railroad began retiring the Alcos for new double deck cab cars.|$|E
50|$|A <b>cab</b> <b>unit</b> is a carbody {{unit with}} a driving cab, or crew compartment. Thus, a <b>cab</b> <b>unit</b> is also always an A unit (a {{locomotive}} with a cab). By contrast, a carbody unit {{can be either}} an A unit, or a B unit (a locomotive without a cab).|$|E

5000|$|This {{terminology}} {{has fallen}} out of use for newer locomotives, since it only really applied to the <b>cab</b> <b>unit</b> style of locomotive. Thus, the term <b>cab</b> <b>unit</b> is used only when an A unit has a carbody design. Hood unit [...] "road switcher" [...] types were generally equipped with driving cabs and the term [...] "A unit" [...] was not generally applied to them, although the rare cabless road switchers were still called B units.|$|E
5000|$|Most British diesel locomotives, e.g. the British Rail Class 37, are <b>cab</b> <b>units</b> but {{the term}} [...] "cab unit" [...] {{is not used}} in Britain. The Class 37, like most British diesel and {{electric}} locomotives, has a cab at each end.|$|R
50|$|Cowl {{units were}} {{originally}} produced {{at the request}} of the Santa Fe, had a full-width 'cowl' body built on a hood unit frame which provided all the structural strength; the bodywork was cosmetic, rather than a load-bearing bridge truss frame as in <b>cab</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The front noses of the EA, E1A, E3A, E4A, E5A, and E6A <b>cab</b> <b>units</b> had a {{pronounced}} slant {{when viewed from}} the side.

5000|$|Compared with {{passenger}} locomotives made {{later by}} EMD, the noses of the E3, E4, E5,and E6 <b>cab</b> <b>units</b> had pronounced slants {{when viewed from}} the side. Therefore, these four models have been nicknamed [...] "slant nose" [...] units. Later E models had the [...] "bulldog nose" [...] of the F series.|$|R
5000|$|In recent years, {{locomotive}} {{manufacturers have}} switched from <b>cab</b> <b>units</b> to cowl units when a full-width body is desired. Since all the structural support on a cowl unit {{is in the}} frame of the locomotive, rather than the body, manufacturers can easily create full-width locomotives from hood unit designs by building cowl units.|$|R
50|$|Earlier {{passenger}} diesels, like EMD E8, ALCO PA, FM Erie-built and Baldwin Sharknose locomotives, were streamlined <b>cab</b> <b>units</b> {{designed for}} visual appeal {{and the appearance}} of speed. The SDP40 instead has the rugged appeal of a high-horsepower road-switcher locomotives of the time. This look was contemporary to, and eventually overtaken by cowl units like the GE U30CG and EMD FP45, SDP40F and F40PH.|$|R
