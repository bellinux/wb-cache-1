The proteins fed to them were pollen, soybean, and yeast powder proteins. To evaluate {{the influence of}} the sugar and/or protein feeding over time, samples were collected during six consecutive harvests.

However, the RJs obtained when the bees were fed cane sugar or corn hydrolysate (regardless of whether they were also fed proteins) gave values of up to - 17 ‰. Sugar content analysis revealed that the composition of maltose, maltotriose, sucrose, and erlose varied significantly over time in accordance with the composition of the syrup fed to the bees. When corn and <b>cereal</b> <b>starch</b> hydrolysates were fed to the bees, the maltose and maltotriose contents of the RJs increased up to 5. 0 and 1. 3 %, respectively, compared to the levels seen in authentic samples (i. e., samples obtained when the bees were fed natural food: honey and pollen) that were inferior to 0. 2 % and not detected, respectively.

The crude extract {{was able to}} hydrolyze gelatinized starch leading to its liquefaction. Generally, gelatinized starch produced more reducing sugars with the crude extract (0. 023 mg/ml) than native starch (0. 008 mg/ml) for millet. The same trend was observed in other crude extracts (malted rice, sweet potato and malted sorghum) and starches too. The crude extract of C. farinosa with increasing concentration decreased viscosity of kunun zaki and imparted varying effects on sensory qualities. Increasing concentration of the extract had more effect on flavour and above 0. 25 % (w/v) the acceptability decreased. Specific density of kunun zaki decreased (1. 198 - 1. 095) with increased concentration of Cadaba farinosa. Temperatures above 70 C affected the hydrolyzing ability of the crude extract.

40|$|The {{influence}} of heating, shearing and addition of amylose {{on the structure}} and rheology of potato starch dispersions has been evaluated. The methods used were dynamic viscoelastic measurements, light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The gelatinized granules were completely close-packed in the concentration range between 4 % and 10 %. Dispersions with intact swollen granules showed a viscoelastic behaviour typical of weak colloidal networks at temperatures above 60 °C. The structural character and the viscoelastic behaviour were completely changed when shear forces were applied during heating. Starch was solubilized and granules were disrupted. Sheared dispersions showed a similar type of viscoelastic behaviour to that of starch in macro-molecular solution. The transition in viscoelastic behaviour that was caused by shearing corresponded with the point where fragments of granules were dispersed in a continuous phase of solubilized starch. A microscale demixing of amylose and amylopectin occurred within the phase of solubilized starch. Shearing did not change the type of viscoelastic behaviour of <b>cereal</b> <b>starch</b> pastes such as wheat and maize starch. Pure potato starch dispersions did not form gels in the time scale studied. <b>Cereal</b> <b>starch</b> systems showed a fast gelation pattern {{similar to that of}} mixed systems with potato starch granules with added aqueous amylose. The gel strength of mixed systems with potato starch and added amylose was evaluated by a model applicable to biphasic aqueous gels. The theory and experiments were in good agreeement, implying that the added amylose and potato starch could be regarded as phase-separated components, and that the inherent amylose of potato starch did not contribute to the gel strength resulting from the added amylose. The granules act as a gel reinforcer by increasing the effective concentration of the amylose network. When a high proportion of amylose was added to systems with molecularly dispersed starch, the resulting gel strength was similar to that in granular systems. TEM studies revealed a number of structure types both in systems with gelatinized granules and in molecularly dispersed starch. The added amylose gave rise to a typical network structure not found in pure potato starch systems. The structure within gelatinized granules was discovered to be quite dense at the surface, which may explain the restraints on the diffusion...|$|E
40|$|Rice starch {{is one of}} {{the major}} <b>cereal</b> <b>starches</b> with novel {{functional}} properties. Significant progress has been made in recent years on the characterization of rice starches separated from different rice cultivars. Studies have revealed that the molecular structure and functional properties are affected by rice germplasm, isolation procedure, climate, agronomic conditions, and grain development. Morphological studies (microscopy and particle size analysis) have reflected significant differences among rice starch granule shapes (polyhedral, irregular) and in granule size (2 to 7 mu m). Nonwaxy and long-grain rice starches show greater variation in granular size than the waxy starches. Rice starch granules are smaller than other <b>cereal</b> <b>starches</b> with amylose contents varying from virtually amylose-free in waxy to about 35 % in nonwaxy and long-grain rice starches. Amylose content appears to be the major factor controlling almost all physicochemical properties of rice starch due to its influence on pasting, gelatinization, retrogradation, syneresis, and other functional properties. Waxy rice starches have high swelling and solubility parameters, and larger relative crystallinity values than nonwaxy and long-grain starches. However, nonwaxy rice starches have a higher gelatinization temperature than the waxy and long-grain starches. The bland taste, nonallergenicity, and smooth, creamy, and spreadable characteristics of rice starch make it unique and valuable in food and pharmaceutical applications.

The swelling power and the solubility behavior of both starches were nearly similar below 65 degrees C. At higher temperatures, starch isolated from the white sorghum cultivar showed higher swelling power and lower solubility index than pigmented sorghum starch. The pasting properties of starches determined by RVA, Rapid Visco Analyser showed different viscosity peaks. Red sorghum starch had a higher value (4731 cP) than white sorghum starch (4093 cP).

40|$|Starch is a plant {{polysaccharide}} with interesting {{functional properties}} (e. g. good gelling, thickening and stabilising capacity) {{which makes it}} a widely used ingredient in products like sauces, soups, bakery and dairy products and candy. To meet the high industrial process and product requirements, starches are often chemically modified. However, with the increasing demand for more natural food products, it is important to investigate alternative, natural ways to alter starch properties. One way to generate new properties is by blending different starches. Starches in a blend can influence each other’s gelatinisation swelling, pasting and gelation and exhibit unexpected physical properties. When the blend properties can(not) be predicted from those of the individual starches, we use the terminology ‘(non) -additive effects’. This dissertation studied gelatinisation, swelling, pasting and gelation of blends of potato (PS), waxy rice (WRS), rice (RS), waxy maize (WMS) and maize (MS) starches and the interactions between the starches. Furthermore, the impact of starch concentration, amylose content, swelling power, granule size and ion content on the properties of starch blends was evaluated. The selected starches showed large differences in crystal type (B-type for PS, A-type for the <b>cereal</b> <b>starches),</b> amylose content (20 - 30 % for PS, RS and MS, 0 % for WRS and WMS) and granule size [10 - 100 µm for PS, 5 - 20 µm for (W) MS and 3 - 8 µm for (W) RS]. Furthermore, the swelling power of PS was respectively 2. 5, 4. 1, 5. 6 and 6. 2 times higher than that of WMS, WRS, MS and RS. Gelatinisation temperatures increased in the order PS, WRS, MS, WMS and RS. PS had a much higher peak viscosity during heating than the <b>cereal</b> <b>starches,</b> but it showed also more viscosity breakdown. RS and MS reached a lower peak viscosity, but showed more setback than WRS and WMS. In a first part, gelatinisation of blends of PS and WRS, RS, WMS or MS (1 : 1 starch dry matter: water) was studied with Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Wide Angle X-ray Diffraction (WAXD). Gelatinisation is the irreversible loss of molecular order when a starch suspension is heated at or above the gelatinisation temperature. WAXD was used to differentiate between the starches in the blend based on their crystal types. Bimodal gelatinisation endotherms were observed both for the individual starches and for the blends. Due to competition for water, gelatinisation of the blends differed from what was expected based on the individual components. Gelatinisation of PS was finished at lower temperature in the blend, while gelatinisation of the other starch was postponed to higher temperature. A novel method to calculate gelatinisation of each starch in the blend based on DSC data qualitatively agreed with the WAXD data. In a second part, pasting and gelation of starch blends was investigated with Rapid Visco Analysis (RVA). This involves granule swelling, leaching of carbohydrates and formation of a three-dimensional network of leached molecules. Pasting profiles of blends of PS and WRS, RS, WMS or MS showed non-additive effects which depended on the total starch concentration. Peak viscosities of the blends were lower than expected at lower total starch concentrations (6. 0 %), peak viscosities changed linearly with the percentages of one starch in the blend. Minimum and end viscosity readings were between the values of the individual starches at lower total starch concentrations. However, at higher total starch concentrations, they were at least as high as the values for PS, especially for blends with MS and RS. The presence of amylose in these starches added to the non-additive effects as these blends reached higher end viscosities than blends with WRS or WMS. To further investigate the factors impacting pasting and gelation of starch blends, different approaches were used. The role of swelling power was studied by reducing that of one starch in the blend by cross-linking it to the extent that viscosity development could no longer be measured with RVA. The cross-linked starch contributed to viscosity development in the blend by increasing the total solid content. The role of granule size was investigated by fractionating PS in three fractions with different granule sizes. The smallest granules had a higher swelling power than the larger granules. Blends of these fractions with WRS showed different pasting profiles. Blends with the smallest PS granules had higher viscosity readings throughout the temperature-time profile than blends with the larger PS granules. However, these differences were probably determined more by the difference in swelling power and granule rigidity between the fractions than by the initial difference in granule size. In a last part, the role of cations was studied. For this, cations were removed from the <b>cereal</b> <b>starches</b> with MilliQ water or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid solutions. The negative charges of phosphate monoesters present in PS can be shielded or even bridged by cations, which reduces hydration and swelling of the PS granules. Removal of cations from the <b>cereal</b> <b>starches</b> led to much higher peak viscosities for the blends with PS. Thus, the reduced swelling observed for blends of PS with native <b>cereal</b> <b>starches</b> was due to the presence of cations in the <b>cereal</b> <b>starches.</b> In conclusion, this work contributed to our understanding of interactions between starches during gelatinisation, swelling, pasting and gelation. We here presented a method to distinguish between starches with different crystal types in blends during gelatinisation. With this, we revealed that gelatinisation in the blends occurs differently from gelatinisation of the individual components. In addition, the study of different aspects impacting pasting and gelation showed that especially the very large swelling power and the presence of phosphate monoesters in PS add to non-additive effects in an important way. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cereal</b> <b>starch</b> {{and straw}} are {{particularly}} good {{candidates for the}} manufacturing of environmentally friendly polymer materials, especially as replacements, either fully or partially, for traditional synthetic plastic products because of their renewal ability, biodegradability, and low cost. However, the use of <b>cereal</b> <b>starch</b> {{for the development of}} bio-based plastics has generated a competition with the human food supply and also created lots of concerns. The use of triticale starch for such purpose can ease those competition and concerns. In this chapter, the development of triticale starch and straw for plastic products and their potential applications are presented. For starch, the most promising venue that can bring rapidly triticale starch into plastic market is as direct use to replace partially traditional plastics and is mainly focused in this chapter. In this case, starch is plasticized and gelatinized (so-called thermoplastic starch or TPS) prior to replace conventional plastics. TPS are also blended with other plastics at a molten stage to produce homogenous blends. All these steps can be performed in one step using conventional plastic processing equipment in order to reduce energy consumption and production cost. The triticale starch morphology, the blending and processing ability into plastic products, and the formulation and the properties of the obtained triticale TPS-based plastic products, such as crystallization structure, morphology, rheological behavior, mechanical properties, and biodegradability are quite comparable to those of other TPS-based plastics made from other starch sources. Thus, it confirms the benefits of TPS-based plastics made from triticale are equivalent with those of other food-grade TPS-based plastics. The straw was processed using different ways to produce either fibers or particles at different sizes prior to incorporating them in commodity plastics. While the starch-based plastics are focused for short-term uses due to the biodegradable nature of starch, the straw-reinforced plastics are aimed for more durable applications with good recycling ability. Different formulations have been developed for both hydrophobic and hydrophilic plastic systems. The processing ability, the performance, and the recycling ability of the triticale straw-reinforced plastics have been proven to be comparable with those of the virgin plastics with significant cost reduction. Finally, the potential of triticale plastic products made from different plastic systems and fabricated by different processes is also envisaged for various industrial applications. This development has registered new value-added products into triticale industrial product portfolio thus enhancing the value proposition for triticale. The massive volume consumption of plastic products can rapidly and significantly increase the net usages of biomass resources based on triticale thus reinforcing the sustainable development in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors in Canada.

Wild relatives exhibited similar types of starch granules to that of their respective cultivated species, though in general the wild species retained a greater proportion of the endosperm cell wall at maturity. The two species examined with no closely related cultivated species exhibited a rice-like endosperm. Wild sorghum relatives exhibited an abundance of endosperm variations described as variations in starch granule size, shape and surface morphology, and the distribution of protein bodies. This is particularly important because the grain of Sorghum bicolor has inherently low starch and protein digestibility. These variations within the wild relatives of commercial cereals may provide novel sources of genetic diversity for future grain improvement programmes...|$|E

40|$|Physicochemical and sensory {{effects of}} Cadaba farinosa crude extract on <b>cereal</b> <b>starches</b> during kunun zaki {{production}} were studied. The crude extract {{was able to}} hydrolyze gelatinized starch leading to its liquefaction. Generally, gelatinized starch produced more reducing sugars with the crude extract (0. 023 mg/ml) than native starch (0. 008 mg/ml) for millet. The same trend was observed in other crude extracts (malted rice, sweet potato and malted sorghum) and starches too. The crude extract of C. farinosa with increasing concentration decreased viscosity of kunun zaki and imparted varying effects on sensory qualities. Increasing concentration of the extract had more effect on flavour and above 0. 25 % (w/v) the acceptability decreased. Specific density of kunun zaki decreased (1. 198 - 1. 095) with increased concentration of Cadaba farinosa. Temperatures above 70 o C affected the hydrolyzing ability of the crude extract. Isolation and purification of the extract`s components is desirable...|$|R
40|$|Starch was {{extracted}} from twenty-four accessions of Group Phureja cultivated diploid potatoes, and from two commercial potato (Solanum tuberosum) varieties. Extracted starch samples were characterized and compared to industrial potato starch. Starch from Phureja generally exhibited smaller granule sizes and lower phosphorus content than starch from commercial potatoes. Amylose content and thermal properties (gelatinization temperature and enthalpy) were however {{in the same}} range for both groups. Starches from Phureja displayed very distinct pasting behavior from that of commercial potato. The former exhibited lower initial pasting viscosity but higher shear resistance. This {{may be related to}} lower starch granule size, causing lower swelling power and solubility. Iodine complexation results seem to indicate that phureja potatoes have higher proportion of amylopectin long chains. Phureja thus appears to be a promising new source of starch with specific physico-chemical and functional properties intermediate between industrial potato and <b>cereal</b> <b>starches.</b> (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Factors that {{determine}} the digestibility of carbohydrates and minerals in cereals are examined. Most carbohydrates and minerals in cereals are structurally bound, either surrounded by or associated with cell wall components not easily digested by non-ruminant animals and humans. Treatments such as mechanical grinding and heat improve the digestibility of nutrient s. Further processing and cooking result in structural and physeochemical changes of <b>cereal</b> <b>starch,</b> phytate, and dietary fiber. Such changes greatly Influence the physiological and metabolic effects in animals and humans. The digestive breakdown of most nutrient components is also {{dependent on the}} activities of enzymes in cereals and in the mammalian digestive system. However, starch, phytate, and dietary fiber are not entirely and readily degraded by enzymes. Undegraded components reduce both the caloric value {{of the food and}} the availabilities of other nutrients by interacting with them in the gastrointestinal tract. Studies on avallabil Hies of carbohydrates and minerals in cereal foods are conducted in humans and rats or under in vitro conditions, using various analytical methods Including microscopy. The advantage of applying light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis to study the digestive breakdown of structural components in cereal foods is highlighted by demonstrating the capabilities of the techniques to reveal both structural and microchemical information...|$|E
40|$|Background: Manipulation of the amylose-amylopectin {{ratio in}} <b>cereal</b> <b>starch</b> has been {{identified}} as a major target for the production of starches with novel functional properties. In wheat, silencing of starch branching enzyme genes by a transgenic approach reportedly caused an increase of amylose content up to 70 % of total starch, exhibiting novel and interesting nutritional characteristics. In this work, the functionality of starch branching enzyme IIa (SBEIIa) has been targeted in bread wheat by TILLING. An EMS-mutagenised wheat population has been screened using High Resolution Melting of PCR products to identify functional SNPs in the three homoeologous genes encoding the target enzyme in the hexaploid genome. Results: This analysis resulted in the identification of 56, 14 and 53 new allelic variants respectively for SBEIIa-A, SBEIIa-B and SBEIIa-D. The effects of the mutations on protein structure and functionality were evaluated by a bioinformatic approach. Two putative null alleles containing non-sense or splice site mutations were identified {{for each of the three}} homoeologous SBEIIa genes; qRT-PCR analysis showed a significant decrease of their gene expression and resulted in increased amylose content. Pyramiding of different single null homoeologous allowed to isolate double null mutants showing an increase of amylose content up to 21 % compared to the control. Conclusion: TILLING has successfully been used to generate novel alleles for SBEIIa genes known to contro...|$|E
40|$|Differences in the {{digestion}} of barley, maize, {{and wheat}} by three major ruminal starch-digesting bacterial species, Streptococcus bovis 26, Ruminobacter amylophilus 50, and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens A 38, were characterized. The rate of starch digestion in all cereal species was greater for S. bovis 26 than for R. amylophilus 50 or B. fibrisolvens A 38. Starch digestion by S. bovis 26 was greater in wheat than in barley or maize, whereas starch digestion by R. amylophilus 50 was greater in barley than in maize or wheat. B. fibrisolvens A 38 digested the starch in barley and maize {{to a similar}} extent but was virtually unable to digest the starch in wheat. The higher ammonia concentration in cultures of B. fibrisolvens A 38 when grown on wheat than when grown on barley or maize suggests that B. fibrisolvens A 38 utilized wheat protein rather than starch. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that B. fibrisolvens A 38 initially colonized cell wall material, while S. bovis 26 randomly colonized the endosperm and R. amylophilus 50 preferentially colonized starch granules. There was subsequent colonization but only superficial digestion of wheat starch granules by B. fibrisolvens A 38. Variation in the association between starch and protein within the endosperm of cereal grains contributes to the differential effectiveness with which amylolytic species can utilize <b>cereal</b> <b>starch...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractStarches used in food {{industry}} are extracted from roots, tubers and cereals. Seeds of jackfruit are abundant and contain high amounts of starch. They are discarded during the fruit processing or consumption {{and can be}} an alternative source of starch. The starch was extract from the jackfruit seeds and characterised to chemical, morphological and functional properties. Soft and hard jackfruit seeds showed starch content of 92. 8 % and 94. 5 %, respectively. Starch granules showed round and bell shape and some irregular cuts on their surface with type-A crystallinity pattern, similar to <b>cereals</b> <b>starches.</b> The swelling power and solubility of jackfruit starch increased with increasing temperature, showing opaque pastes. The soft seeds starch showed initial and final gelatinisation temperature of 36 °C and 56 °C, respectively; while hard seeds starch presented initial gelatinisation at 40 °C and final at 61 °C. These {{results suggest that the}} Brazilian jackfruit seeds starches could be used in food products...|$|R
40|$|Consumer {{concerns}} to synthetic chemicals {{have led to}} strong preference for ‘clean’ label starches. Lipidand hydrocolloids are food friendly chemicals. This study determines the effects of stearic acid and xan-than gum alone and in combination on the functionality of maize, wheat, teff and cassava starches. Anincrease in viscosity was observed for all starches with stearic acid and xanthan gum compared to thecontrols with cassava having the least increase. A further increase in viscosity was observed for the cerealstarches with combination of stearic acid and xanthan gum. Stearic acid reduced retrogradation, resultingin soft textured pastes. Combination of stearic acid and xanthan gum reduced the formation of type IIbamylose–lipid complexes, syneresis, and hysteresis in <b>cereal</b> <b>starches</b> compared to stearic acid alone. Acombination of stearic acid and xanthan gum produce higher viscosity non-gelling starches and xanthangum addition increases physical stability to freezing and better structural recovery after shear.

40|$|Starch, {{normally}} {{consisting of}} amylose and amylopectin, is a partially crystalline polymeric substance. Native starch granules may give A-, B-, C-, and V-type X-ray diffraction patterns. A-type crystalline structure occurs in <b>cereal</b> <b>starches,</b> whereas B-type structure {{is found in}} tuber, root, and amylose-rich starches. The C-type polymorph {{is a mixture of}} A- and B-type polymorphs and occurs in some tuber and legume starches. The V-type diffraction pattern is given by amylose lipids, iodine, and alcohol complexes. Upon heating in water, starch undergoes gelatinization, which breaks up its crystalline structure. During subsequent cooling and storage, recrystallization or retrogradation of gelatinized starch occurs.
