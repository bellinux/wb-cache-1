5|$|Bigfin reef squids and the <b>common</b> <b>octopus</b> (Octopus vulgaris) {{were studied}} {{to resolve a}} century-long debate over whether {{cephalopods}} can hear. Unlike fishes, cephalopods do not possess air-filled swim bladders, which might amplify sound waves travelling in water. The results were published in 2009. It showed that bigfin reef squids and octopuses utilise their statocysts for detecting vibrations, an organ primarily used for maintaining spatial orientation. The <b>common</b> <b>octopus</b> can hear sounds between 400Hz and 1000Hz. Bigfin reef squids have a slightly better hearing range of 400Hz to 1500Hz. Both hear best at a frequency of 600Hz. Relatively, their hearing is comparable to prawns and some other invertebrates but is less sensitive than that of most fishes.|$|E
5|$|Deimatic {{behaviour}} {{is found}} in cephalopods including the common cuttlefish Sepia officinalis, squid such as the Caribbean reef squid (Sepioteuthis sepioidea) and bigfin reef squid (Sepioteuthis lessoniana), octopuses including the <b>common</b> <b>octopus</b> Octopus vulgaris and the Atlantic white-spotted octopus (Octopus macropus), and the paper nautilus (Argonauta argo). Deimatic cephalopod displays involve suddenly creating bold stripes, often reinforced by stretching out the animal's arms, fins or web {{to make it look}} as big and threatening as possible.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} intelligence, {{octopuses}} {{are listed in}} some countries as experimental animals on which surgery may not be performed without anesthesia, a protection usually extended only to vertebrates. In the UK from 1993 to 2012, the <b>common</b> <b>octopus</b> (Octopus vulgaris) was the only invertebrate protected under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. In 2012, this legislation was extended to include all cephalopods in accordance with a general EU directive.|$|E

5|$|For example, in {{the common}} {{cuttlefish}} the display consists of flattening the body, making the skin pale, showing a pair of eyespots on the mantle, dark eye rings, and a dark line on the fins, and dilating the pupils of the eyes. The <b>common</b> <b>octopus</b> similarly displays pale skin and dark eye rings with dilated pupils, but also curls its arms and stretches out the web between the arms as far as possible, and squirts out jets of water. Other octopuses such as Atlantic white-spotted octopus turn bright brownish red with oval white spots all over in a high contrast display. The paper nautilus can rapidly change its appearance: it suddenly withdraws the shining iridescent web formed by its first pair of arms from its shell.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses have keen eyesight. Like other cephalopods, {{they can}} {{distinguish}} the polarisation of light. Colour vision appears to vary from species to species, for example being present in O. aegina but absent in O. vulgaris. Attached {{to the brain}} are two special organs called statocysts (sac-like structures containing a mineralised mass and sensitive hairs), that allow the octopus to sense the orientation of its body. They provide information on {{the position of the}} body relative to gravity and can detect angular acceleration. An autonomic response keeps the octopus's eyes oriented so that the pupil is always horizontal. Octopuses may also use the statocyst to hear sound. The <b>common</b> <b>octopus</b> can hear sounds between 400Hz and 1000Hz, and hears best at 600Hz.|$|E
5|$|Quite common {{within its}} small range, the {{sluggish}} and reclusive puffadder shyshark {{is often seen}} lying still on the sea floor. It is gregarious and several individuals may rest together. A generalist predator with grasping dentition, the puffadder shyshark is known to take a variety of small benthic prey: crustaceans (including crabs, shrimp, crayfish, mantis shrimp, and hermit crabs), annelid worms (including polychaetes), bony fishes (including anchovies, jack macherels, and gobies), cephalopods (including squid), and fish offal. Overall, the most important component of this shark's diet is crustaceans, followed by polychaetes and then fishes. Males seem to prefer polychaetes, while females prefer crustaceans. It has been observed attacking a <b>common</b> <b>octopus</b> (Octopus vulgaris) by tearing off an arm with a twisting motion.|$|E

500|$|Octopuses live {{in every}} ocean, and {{different}} species {{have adapted to}} different marine habitats. As juveniles, <b>common</b> <b>octopuses</b> inhabit shallow tide pools. The Hawaiian day octopus (Octopus cyanea) lives on coral reefs; argonauts drift in pelagic waters. Abdopus aculeatus mostly lives in near-shore seagrass beds. Some species are adapted to the cold, ocean depths. The spoon-armed octopus (Bathypolypus arcticus) is found in abyssal plains at depths of , and Vulcanoctopus hydrothermalis lives near hydrothermal vents at [...] The cirrate species are often free-swimming and live in deep-water habitats.

40|$|Cephalopods {{are known}} to {{accumulate}} cadmium and {{play an important role}} in its biomagnification. They are an essential link in marine trophic chain and represent an important case in studies on cadmium transfer to man through the food chain. Since cadmium concentration widely varies in different tissues of the cephalopods – mainly accumulating in the hepatopancreas – evisceration represents a recommended preliminary step to reduce cadmium intake in view of cephalopods consumption; yet, the residual concentration in the edible part may still be a risk for public health. This study is intended to assess cadmium levels variability in the muscles of Cephalopoda, considering the different feeding habitats and marine trophic webs. In compliance with EU regulation, a survey on cadmium and other heavy metal levels in various sea food, including cephalopods, was conducted by the Istituto Zooprofilattico of Sardinia in co-operation with local health authorities. During a five-year survey (2008 - 2012), 90 samples were collected from the following species: <b>commons</b> <b>octopus</b> (Octopus vulgaris), cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis), European squid (Loligo vulgaris), and flying squid (Todarodes sagittatus), located in different coastal areas and representatives of either benthic or nektonic habitats.

Further analysis by liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection (LC-FLD) identified STX as the major contributing toxin in these samples. The presence of STX was confirmed by LC-mass spectrometry and comparison of fragmentation patterns with an authentic STX standard. LC-FLD quantitation and conversion of the Octopus sp. 5 extracts revealed toxin concentrations as high as 246 μg STX/ 100 g tissue, {{more than three times}} the US, European and Australian regulatory limit for human consumption of shellfish of 80 μg STX/ 100 g tissue.

40|$|The first {{red water}} {{appeared}} in the south-western coast of Omura Bay from middle July to early August, and the second one spread all over {{the southern part of}} the Bay from latter August to middle September 1965. Both bloomings were due to Gymnodinium sp. This paper mainly deals with the second one. This blooming was accompanied by the phenomenon that dissolved oxygen in the bottom water-mass dwindled into zero, and also by the mass-mortality of fishes―goby, blenny, globefish, <b>common</b> eel, <b>octopus,</b> dragonet, anchovy, gray mullet, conger eel, etc. Nevertheless the distribution of blooming was limited to the southern part and the water-mass without dissolved oxygen and the mass-mortality extended all over the bay. What has caused this mass-mortality ? From the status of the red water, the dissolved oxygen content in the bottom water-mass and the progress of decomposition above the ark shell, it was assumed that the mass-mortality of fishes and invertebrates was not caused by the red water, but primarily by the depletion of dissolved oxygen in the bottom water-mass all over the Bay...|$|R
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISICephalopods {{are common}} in Chilean waters; however, there is little {{information}} on the distribution and abundance of their early life stages. In the austral spring seasons of 2008 and 2009 zooplankton samples were collected during two oceanographic cruises (CIMAR 14, CIMAR 15) in Patagonian fjords and channels of southern Chile between 46 degrees S and 53 degrees S. Zooplankton sampling was conducted at 82 stations with Bongo (60 cm diameter, 300 mu m mesh size) and Tucker (1 m(2) diameter, 300 mu m mesh size) trawl nets. The paralarvae were preliminarily identified by morphology and pigment patterns. Subsequently, their identity was confirmed through mitochondrial DNA (16 S rRNA and COIII) analysis comparing them with the <b>common</b> adult <b>octopus</b> species from Chile which also have planktonic paralarvae (Octopus mimus, R. fontaniana and Enteroctopus megalocyathus) by phylogenetic analysis. We obtained 12 octopus and 1 squid paralarvae in 2008 and 16 octopus and 1 squid paralarvae in 2009. The paralarvae were caught exclusively in areas with higher oceanic influence and were absent in areas with greater freshwater discharge and/or ice melting. Southern Chile is characterized by geomorphological discontinuity due to fragmentation of the south coast starting at 41 degrees 30 'S, {{where there is a}} large freshwater influence in estuaries promoting fjord-like characteristics. Thus, {{it is not surprising that}} cephalopod paralarvae were not found in such places, because they are stenohaline. Both morphometric and molecular data confirmed that 26 paralarvae belonged to R. fontaniana; one paralarva was identified as Enteroctopus megalocyahtus; Doryteuthis gahi and Onychoteuthidae were also collected. Our results expand the known range of cephalopod paralarvae to areas where they have never have been reported in the southern tip of Chile. The presence of paralarvae in these fjords supports the hypothesis of their use as spawning grounds for many species of squid and octopus of different families.
