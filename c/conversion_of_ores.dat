40|$|The linear {{quadratic}} control synthesis {{for a set}} of coupled first-order hyperbolic partial differential and algebraic equations is presented by using the infinite-dimensional Hilbert state-space representation of the system and the well-known operator Riccati equation (ORE) method. Solving the algebraic equations and substituting them into the partial differential equations (PDEs) results in a model consisting of a set of pure hyperbolic PDEs. The resulting PDE system involves a hyperbolic operator in which the velocity matrix is spatially varying, non-symmetric, and its eigenvalues are not necessarily negative through of the domain. The C 0 -semigroup generation property of such an operator is proven and it is shown that the generated C 0 -semigroup is exponentially stable and, consequently, the ORE has a unique and non-negative solution. <b>Conversion</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ORE</b> into a matrix Riccati differential equation allows the use of a numerical scheme to solve the control problem.

The work was erected just inside the Euclid Avenue entrance of Lake View Cemetery on December 6, 1884. Senator Henry B. Payne and Ohio railroad executive John H. Devereux spoke at the unveiling.

Uranium oxide was reacted with potassium fluoride in large vats {{on the roof of}} Westinghouse's plant in Bloomfield, New Jersey.

But Edward Creutz, the head of the Metallurgical Laboratory's group responsible for fabricating the uranium, wanted a metal sphere the size of an orange for his experiments.
