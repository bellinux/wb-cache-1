40|$|In <b>a</b> proper vertex <b>coloring</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> graph a {{subgraph}} is colorful if its vertices are colored {{with different}} colors. It is well-known (see {{for example in}} Gyárfás (1980)) that in every proper <b>coloring</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> k-chromatic graph there is a colorful path Pk on k vertices. The first author proved in 1987 that k-chromatic and triangle-free graphs have a path Pk which is an induced subgraph. N. R. Aravind conjectured that these results can be put together: in every proper <b>coloring</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> k- chromatic triangle-free graph, there is an induced colorful Pk. Here we prove the following weaker result providing some evidence towards this conjecture: For a suitable function f(k), in any proper <b>coloring</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> f(k) -chromatic graph of girth at least five, there is an induced colorful path on k vertices...|$|R
2500|$|An edge <b>coloring</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> graph is <b>a</b> [...] proper <b>coloring</b> <b>of</b> the edges, meaning <b>an</b> {{assignment}} <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> to edges {{so that no}} vertex is {{incident to}} two edges <b>of</b> the same <b>color.</b> An edge coloring with k colors is called a k-edge-coloring and {{is equivalent to the}} problem of partitioning the edge set into k matchings. The smallest number <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> needed for <b>an</b> edge <b>coloring</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> graph G is the chromatic index, or edge chromatic number, χ′(G). A Tait coloring is <b>a</b> 3-edge <b>coloring</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cubic graph. The four color theorem is equivalent to the assertion that every planar cubic bridgeless graph admits a Tait coloring.|$|R

5|$|Many reticle {{illumination}} {{and pattern}} options are available. Common light sources used in firearm reflector sights include battery powered lights, fiber optic light collectors, and even tritium capsules. Some sights {{are specifically designed}} to be visible when viewed through night vision devices. The <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sight reticle is often red or amber for visibility against most backgrounds. Some sights use a chevron or triangular pattern instead, to aid precision aiming and range estimation, and still others provide selectable patterns.|$|E
5|$|The {{twentieth century}} saw {{increasingly}} rapid {{advances in the}} scientific study of stars. The photograph became a valuable astronomical tool. Karl Schwarzschild discovered that the <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> star and, hence, its temperature, could be determined by comparing the visual magnitude against the photographic magnitude. The development of the photoelectric photometer allowed precise measurements of magnitude at multiple wavelength intervals. In 1921 Albert A. Michelson made the first measurements of a stellar diameter using an interferometer on the Hooker telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory.|$|E

The largest green party in Europe is Alliance '90/The Greens (German: Bündnis 90/Die Grünen) in Germany, which was formed in 1993 from the merger of the German Green Party, founded in West Germany in 1980, and Alliance 90, founded during the Revolution of 1989–1990 in East Germany. In the 2009 federal elections, the party won 11% of the votes and 68 out of 622 seats in the Bundestag.|$|E

5|$|The {{massacre}} was {{remembered in}} 1858 in a celebration organized by William Cooper Nell, an African American abolitionist {{who saw the}} death of Crispus Attucks {{as an opportunity to}} demonstrate the role of African Americans in the Revolutionary War. Partly because of this activism, artwork commemorating the massacre was produced that changed the <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> victim's skin to black (which in Revere's original engraving was white) to emphasize Attucks' claimed martyrdom. In 1888, a monument was erected on the Boston Common to the men killed in the massacre, and the five victims, along with Christopher Seider, were reinterred in a prominent grave in the Granary Burying Ground.|$|E
5|$|Without {{ultrasound}} {{or other}} special tools, determining if a sheep is pregnant is difficult. Ewes only begin to visibly show a pregnancy {{about six weeks}} before giving birth, so shepherds often rely {{on the assumption that}} a ram will impregnate all the ewes in a flock. However, by fitting a ram with a chest harness called a marking harness that holds a special crayon (or raddle, sometimes spelled reddle), ewes that have been mounted are marked with a color. Dye may also be directly applied to the ram's brisket. This measure is not used in flocks where wool is important, since the <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> raddle contaminates it.|$|E
5|$|Dishonored {{features}} role-playing game elements, such as {{the ability}} to upgrade powers and to make moral choices with a focus on non-linear consequences. The game is designed to allow the player to complete it without killing any non-player characters (NPC), including boss characters and mission targets. An example of a non-lethal situation given by co-creative designer Harvey Smith involved the player completing a side mission for a character, and in return that character had two of Corvo's targets kidnapped and enslaved. Each mission contains multiple ways to explore and reach targets. Movement through and exploration of levels is designed to support the player character's abilities, rather than specific paths that are aimed at a particular gameplay style, such as hacking or sneaking. Specific elements of missions, such as changes to the <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> target's clothing and mask in one mission are randomized, requiring the player to explore the game area to find the target each time the mission is played.|$|E

50|$|As with {{unsigned}} graphs, {{there is}} <b>a</b> notion <b>of</b> signed graph <b>coloring.</b> Where <b>a</b> <b>coloring</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> graph is a mapping from the vertex {{set to the}} natural numbers, <b>a</b> <b>coloring</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> signed graph is a mapping from the vertex set to the integers.The constraints on proper colorings come from {{the edges of the}} signed graph. The integers assigned to two vertices must be distinct if they are connected by a positive edge.

Because {{the colors}} are not identified by national standards, the purpose of color-coding a receptacle is set by the building owner.

25|$|Cut {{also affects}} the <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> diamond. This is {{especially}} important when considering fancy colored diamonds, where the slightest shift in color could vastly affect {{the price of the}} diamond.

25|$|Generally {{there are}} three major methods to artificially alter the <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> diamond: {{irradiation}} with high-energy subatomic particles; the application of thin films or coatings; and the combined application of high pressure and high temperature (HPHT).

25|$|Dedicated {{regions of}} the brain are {{specialized}} for given functions. Increased cross-talk between regions specialized for different functions {{may account for the}} many types of synesthesia. For example, the additive experience of seeing color when looking at graphemes might be due to cross-activation of the grapheme-recognition area and the color area called V4 (see figure). This is supported by the fact that grapheme-color synesthetes are able to identify the <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> grapheme in their peripheral vision even when they cannot consciously identify the shape of the grapheme.|$|E
25|$|Another common {{theory is}} that the waitoreke is {{actually}} a beaver. This is because several of the sightings report that the waitoreke lives in dams like those of a beaver. The fur <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> beaver is also close to that of the description of a waitoreke. However, the body shape and the tail structure of a waitoreke are different than that of a beaver. If the waitoreke was a beaver it would most likely be introduced by European settlers and would then be related to the European beaver.|$|E
