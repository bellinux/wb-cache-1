50|$|Emerson {{manufactures}} a {{scroll compressor}} that {{is capable of}} varying the refrigerant flow as per requirement. Instead of fixing the scrolls together permanently, the scrolls are allowed to move apart periodically. As the scrolls move apart, the motor continues to turn but the scrolls lose the ability to compress refrigerant, thus motor power is reduced when the scroll compressor is not pumping. By alternating the two different working states: the loaded state and the unloaded state. A solenoid contracts and expands the rotating scroll and/or the fixed scroll, using axial compliance. The controller modifies the load time, and the unload time, matching the capacity of the compressor to the load requested. This type of scroll compressors while offering variable <b>capacity</b> <b>control,</b> normally down to 20% of the full flow, can suffer from a significant loss of efficiency especially toward the lower range of the <b>capacity</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe use of {{air source}} heat pumps is an {{efficient}} method to provide heat for space heating and {{domestic hot water}} in residential buildings, which cover roughly {{one third of the}} German domestic energy use. <b>Capacity</b> <b>controlled</b> heat pumps are gaining increased market share and provide high flexibility in operation. The possibility to use thermal storage to decouple thermal production and electric load from the heat pump can be used for operation strategies, hereby increasing the possibility to integrate electricity production from renewable energy sources. In the work presented, a range of operational strategies for <b>capacity</b> <b>controlled</b> heat pumps connected to a thermal storage in German multifamily houses are introduced and evaluated. The use cases include maximization of energy performance, cost minimization and utilization of on-site photovoltaic production. For optimal storage operation a model predictive control (MPC) approach using quadratic programming is presented together with simplified models of the multi-family house, a thermal storage and a <b>capacity</b> <b>controlled</b> air-to-water heat pump, the MPC creates a control signal to the heat pump. The resulting control signal is then applied to a detailed heat pump model to investigate the impact on the efficiency of the heat pump unit and thereby its electric energy consumption with different storage options. Results show that the MPC strategy is able to adapt to different objectives. One of the most important findings is that changing the objective towards a variable day-ahead-price-based operation leads to decreased heat pump efficiency but increases revenue. The sensitivity analysis towards storage size shows little influence in the range of sizes investigated...|$|R
50|$|A chiller is a {{refrigeration}} unit designed to produce cool (chilled) water for space cooling purposes.The chilled water is then circulated {{to one or}} more cooling coils located in air handling units, fan-coils, or induction units. Chilled water distribution is not constrained by the 100 foot separation limit that applies to DX systems, thus chilled water-based cooling systems are typically used in larger buildings. <b>Capacity</b> <b>control</b> in a chilled water system is usually achieved through modulation of water flow through the coils; thus, multiple coils may be served from a single chiller without compromising control of any individual unit.Chillers may operate on either the vapor compression principle or the absorption principle. Vapor compression chillers may utilize reciprocating, centrifugal, screw, or rotary compressor configurations. Reciprocating chillers are commonly used for capacities below 200 tons; centrifugal chillers are normally used to provide higher capacities; rotary and screw chillers are less commonly used, but are not rare. Heat rejection from a chiller may be by way of an air-cooled condenser or a cooling tower (both discussed below). Vapor compression chillers may be bundled with an air-cooled condenser to provide a packaged chiller, which would be installed outside of the building envelope. Vapor compression chillers may also be designed to be installed separate from the condensing unit; normally such a chiller would be installed in an enclosed central plant space. Absorption chillers are designed to be installed separate from the condensing unit.|$|E

40|$|The {{restructuring}} of power markets has given large generating firms significant price-setting ability. In this paper I argue that <b>capacity</b> <b>controlled</b> by large firms is used less profitably than <b>capacity</b> <b>controlled</b> by small firms. Large producers hold back output {{to push up}} prices. Small producers benefit from the high prices without incurring the costs of restricted output. When entry is considered, and profit opportunity {{is determined by the}} cost of entry, this “curse of market power ” is not just a comparative curse – the long-run profits of large firms can be reduced because of their incentive to push up prices. I suggest ways that power producers can cope with the curse of market power, including the sale of long-term forward contracts. Past research has demonstrated that forward sales indicate commitment to aggressive behavior to a competing duopolist. I add explicitly modeled entry to this literature, and show that the forward sales can eliminate the curse of market power by deterring excess entry. The existence of a forward market increases the profits of large firms, and enhances economic efficiency. Please send comments to...|$|R

The most attractive property of GS-SVMs is that its computational complexity scales quadratically with the size of training samples in the worst case.

40|$|Consider {{a dynamic}} {{decision}} making model under risk with a fixed planning horizon, namely the dynamic <b>capacity</b> <b>control</b> model. The model describes a firm, {{operating in a}} monopolistic setting and selling a range of products consuming a single resource. Demand for each product is time-dependent and modeled by a random variable. The firm controls the revenue stream by allowing or denying customer requests for product classes. We investigate risk-sensitive policies in this setting, for which risk concerns are important for many non-repetitive events and short-time considerations. Analyzing several numerically risk-averse <b>capacity</b> <b>control</b> policies in terms of standard deviation and conditional-value-at-risk, our results show that only a slight modification of the risk-neutral solution is needed to apply a risk-averse policy. In particular, risk-averse policies which decision rules are functions depending only on the marginal values of the risk-neutral policy perform well. The risk sensitivity of a policy only depends on the current state {{but it does not}} matter whether risk-neutral or risk-averse decisions led to the state. From a practical perspective, the advantage is that a decision maker does not need to compute any risk-averse dynamic program.

5000|$|Before the {{emergence}} of revenue management, BOAC (now British Airways) experimented with differentiated fare products by offering <b>capacity</b> <b>controlled</b> [...] "Earlybird" [...] discounts to stimulate demand for seats that would otherwise fly empty. Taking it a step further, Robert Crandall, former Chairman and CEO of American Airlines, pioneered a practice he called yield management, which focused primarily on maximizing revenue through analytics-based inventory control. Under Crandall's leadership, American continued to invest in yield management's forecasting, inventory control and overbooking capabilities. By the early 1980s, {{the combination of a}} mild recession and new competition spawned by airline deregulation act (1978) posed an additional threat. Low-cost, low-fare airlines like People Express were growing rapidly because of their ability to charge even less than American's Super Saver fares. After investing millions in the next generation capability which they would call DINAMO (Dynamic Inventory Optimization and Maintenance Optimizer), American announced Ultimate Super Saver Fares in 1985 that were priced lower than the PeoplExpress. These fares were non-refundable in addition to being advance-purchase restricted and <b>capacity</b> <b>controlled.</b> This yield management system targeted those discounts to only those situations where they had a surplus of empty seats. The system and analysts engaged in continual re-evaluation of the placement of the discounts to maximize their use. Over the next year, American's revenue increased 14.5% and its profits were up 47.8%.|$|R
40|$|Many {{marketers}} {{and academics}} assume that customers always want {{control of the}} service experience and benefit (perceive value) from having more control (Namasivayam and Mount, 2006). However, empirical support for this assumption is limited. The study proposes that beneficial effects will occur if the opportunity and <b>capacity</b> for <b>control</b> are aligned with desire for control. Conflicting control beliefs –on the other handwill have a detrimental effect. The research question is: (How) does desire for control affect customer attitudes and behavior? To answer the research question, we conducted an experiment in a service context. We developed and produced 8 different video clips in which opportunity, capacity and desire for control were manipulated in a scenario. 379 students participated in the experiment. The results were analyzed with Man(c) ova. The study demonstrates {{that the effect of}} capacity and opportunity for control is not always positive because the effect depends on desire for control. Customers having the desired level of opportunity and <b>capacity</b> for <b>control</b> are most satisfied (with self, the service provider, service process and service outcome); customers having more opportunity and <b>capacity</b> for <b>control</b> than desired are less satisfied and customers having less opportunity and <b>capacity</b> for <b>control</b> than desired are least satisfied. Furthermore, consistency with desire also increases the strength of positive behavioral intentions (like loyalty and positive word of mouth) and conflict with desire increases the strength of negative behavioral intentions (like complaining and switching). The main theoretical conclusion of this study is therefore that more control is not always better: it is better when it is desired, but worse when it is not desired. The managerial implication is that the customer should {{be given the opportunity to}} choose not to exercise control.
