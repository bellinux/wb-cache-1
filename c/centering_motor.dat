50|$|Experiments {{have found}} that the {{temporal}} length of the motor control loop takes approximately 250-400 ms. <b>Motor</b> <b>centers,</b> however, are already making corrections to their previous motor plan about 70 ms after the onset of the movement based on peripheral information that should not have arrived yet. It is thus likely that there are motor emulators that receive and process efferent copies and then send predictive peripheral output before the actual peripheral output from sensors is received. <b>Motor</b> <b>centers</b> often have to run very quickly. Feedback delays and peripheral errors make real-time, rapid motor movement very difficult and liable to failure. Through the use of emulators <b>motor</b> <b>centers</b> can receive fast and reliable feedback {{in the form of a}} priori predictions. The later real periphery output can then be incorporated into a more accurate model.|$|R

50|$|Saccades are {{the very}} quick, {{simultaneous}} movements made by the eye to receive visual information and shift the line of vision from one position to another. A person depends profoundly {{on the ability of}} the accuracy of these movements. The information is received from the retina, is translated into spatial information and is then transferred to <b>motor</b> <b>centers</b> for <b>motor</b> response. A person with saccadic dysmetria will constantly produce abnormal eye movements including microsaccades, ocular flutter, and square wave jerks even when the eye is at rest. During eye movements hypometric and hypermetric saccades will occur and interruption and slowing of normal saccadic movement is common.|$|R

40|$|The NIOSH <b>Center</b> for <b>Motor</b> Vehicle Safety {{conducted}} a midcourse review of its NIOSH <b>Center</b> for <b>Motor</b> Vehicle Safety Strategic Plan for Research and Prevention, 2014 - 2018. This document outlines midcourse review purpose, methodology, results of internal review and external input, and research topics to consider {{for the remaining}} {{two years of the}} strategic plan. What we do: The NIOSH <b>Center</b> for <b>Motor</b> Vehicle Safety (CMVS), with our partners, conducts research and develops strategies to prevent work-related motor vehicle crashes and injuries. Through 5 strategic goals, we're working to: 1) identify risk factors for work-related crashes 2) apply engineering and technology-based safety interventions 3) promote evidence-based policies, standards, and regulations 4) collaborate with global partners and 5) communicate safety and policy recommendations. Why we do it: Millions of workers drive or ride in a motor vehicle as part of their jobs. Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of work-related injury deaths in the United States, accounting for 23, 865 deaths from 2003 - 2015. These deaths have an impact on workers, their families, businesses, and communities. In 2013 alone, motor vehicle crashes at work cost U. S. employers $ 25 billion - $ 65, 000 per nonfatal injury and $ 671, 000 per death. All workers are at risk of crashes, whether they drive light or heavy vehicles, or whether driving is a main or incidental job duty. The goal of the <b>Center</b> for <b>Motor</b> Vehicle Safety {{is to make sure that}} those who work in or near vehicles come home safely at the end of their work day. Who we work with: CMVS researchers collaborate with partners in industry, labor, professional and trade associations, government agencies, and academia. What sets us apart: NIOSH is the only part of the U. S. federal government whose mission encompasses prevention of work-related motor vehicle crashes and resulting injuries for all worker populations. Other federal agencies have responsibilities and interest in motor vehicle safety for specific worker groups (e. g., truckers, fire fighters, law enforcement officers). Priority populations: We research and provide guidance to promote motor vehicle safety for truck drivers, other high-risk workers (e. g., emergency medical service (EMS), law enforcement, oil and gas extraction workers), and all who drive for work (e. g., home healthcare workers, sales representatives).
