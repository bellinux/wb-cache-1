500|$|Bates goes {{hunting with}} a native, who brings down a <b>crested</b> <b>oropendola</b> with a {{blowpipe}} {{at a range}} of 30 yards (27 metres); {{he notes that the}} usefully silent weapon can kill at twice that range, but that he and Wallace [...] "found it very difficult to hold steady the long tubes". Around a campfire, he listens to tales; the Bouto or river dolphin used to take [...] "the shape of a beautiful woman, with hair hanging loose to her heels, and walking ashore at night in the streets of Ega, to entice the young men down to the water" [...] where the Bouto would grab them and [...] "plunge beneath the waves with a triumphant cry". They go turtle-hunting; and Bates kills an alligator with a heavy stick. He finds many footprints of the jaguar, and [...] "the great pleasure" [...] of seeing the [...] "rare and curious umbrella bird". Arrived in Catua, he admires a woman of 17: [...] "her figure was almost faultless", and her blue mouth [...] "gave quite a captivating finish to her appearance", but she was [...] "extremely bashful". He is amazed at how much alcohol the [...] "shy Indian and Mameluco maidens" [...] can drink, never giving way to their suitors without it.|$|E

25|$|Bird World, {{opened in}} 1975, {{features}} open aviaries in which guests can mingle with exotic birds such as Egyptian plovers, rhinoceros hornbills, and <b>crested</b> <b>oropendolas</b> and even two-toed sloths. Each area features naturalistic habitats and replicated tropic and aquatic ecosystems, with three major exhibits built without barriers so the birds can fly freely among zoo visitors. At the Bird World kitchen viewing window, visitors can see firsthand what the birds eat. There are four outdoor exhibits directly {{attached to the}} exterior of Bird World which are home to African penguins, Steller's sea eagles, kea and double-wattled cassowaries.|$|R
50|$|The <b>crested</b> <b>oropendola</b> {{also known}} as the Suriname <b>crested</b> <b>oropendola</b> or the cornbird (Psarocolius decumanus) is a New World {{tropical}} icterid bird. It is a resident breeder in lowland South America east of the Andes, from Panama and Colombia south to northern Argentina, as well as on Trinidad and Tobago. If the genus Gymnostinax for the Montezuma oropendola and its closest relatives were considered valid, this species would probably belong in that genus (Price & Lanyon 2002).|$|E
5000|$|Four {{somewhat}} different species were formerly separated in the genus Gymnostinops. Alternatively, the <b>crested</b> <b>oropendola</b> (and possibly others) would also belong here (Price & Lanyon 2002): ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>crested</b> <b>oropendola</b> inhabits forest {{edges and}} clearings. It is a colonial breeder which builds a hanging woven nest, more than 125 cm long, {{high in a}} tree. It lays two blotched blue-grey eggs which hatch in 15-19 days, with another 24-36 days to fledging.|$|E
50|$|The Forest Aviary in Primate Panorama is a 7500 sq ft area richly {{landscaped}} and {{enclosed in}} a nearly invisible wire mesh. Visitors can walk around inside with the birds, which include black swan, black-necked swan, scarlet ibis (housed with the flamingos in the winter), mandarin ducks, nene (or Hawaiian goose), and <b>crested</b> <b>oropendola.</b>|$|E
50|$|This tyrant flycatcher {{is found}} in savannah and other semi-open habitat with large trees. It gets its name {{because it does not}} build its own nest, but appropriates the domed or {{enclosed}} nests of other, often far larger, bird species, such as yellow-rumped cacique or <b>crested</b> <b>oropendola.</b> Once the persistence of the flycatchers has driven the rightful owners away, their eggs are removed, and the female flycatcher lays up to four, but usually two, black-streaked brown eggs. She incubates these on her own for 16 days to hatching, with a further 18-20 days to fledging.|$|E
50|$|Kayapo {{men can be}} {{seen with}} disks in their lower lips. However this is {{something}} mainly seen among older generations as it has become less popular with the younger Kayapo men. The men adorn themselves with radiating feathers in their hair, as the feathers represent the universe. Kayapo men also can be seen with rope in their hair, to represent the rope in which the first Kayapo used to arrive from the sky. Traditionally, Kayapo men cover their lower bodies with sheaths. Due to increased contact with outside cultures, contemporary Kayapo can often been seen wearing Western style clothing such as shorts. Kayapo chiefs wear a headdress made out of vibrant yellow feathers to represent the rays of the sun. The feathers used in their headdresses are from birds native to their area such as hyacinth macaw and <b>crested</b> <b>oropendola.</b> The birds found in the Amazon are naturally bright in color, so Kayapo do not dye their feathers.|$|E

40|$|African weaverbirds (subfamily Ploceinae) use {{a variety}} of weaving {{stitches}} in nest construction, which suggests that in these woven nests building behaviour is particularly complex. However, birds in several other families also make hanging nests of entangled vegetation, the most impressive being nests made by the New World orioles and oropendolas (family Icteridae). Examination of nests of the Yellow Oriole (Icterus nigrogularis) and <b>Crested</b> <b>Oropendola</b> (Psaracolius decumanus) in this study demonstrates that a similar range of stitches are used by these species compared with the Ploceinae. The nests of both species, however, make particular use of two simple stitches, the half hitch and simple loop; both species also use a simple weaving technique. Spiral binding is shown by both species, but was at its highest density around the entrance of the nests of the <b>Crested</b> <b>Oropendola.</b> The difficulty of weaving compared to other techniques and the extent of its occurrence among birds are discussed...|$|E
