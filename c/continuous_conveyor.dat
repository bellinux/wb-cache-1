50|$|In {{internal}} logistics, {{there are}} various ways for getting product flows up or down. A solution which is often used is the deployment of incline or lowering belts. When placed at an angle in order to bridge a height difference, such belt conveyors also {{have the advantage of}} covering a certain distance. A disadvantage is the loss of much useful floor space {{as a result of the}} presence of the necessary supports for the belt conveyor. A bigger distance over a smaller floor area can be bridged using a product lift or a vertical conveyor. A <b>continuous</b> <b>conveyor</b> or a discontinuous conveyor can be chosen as a vertical conveyor.

40|$|The {{movement}} {{of raw materials}} {{can be one of}} the most challenging tasks in open pit mining, with truck transportation representing the largest factor in mining costs and resulting in major greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this study, the transportation methods of bulk materials within German hard-rock open pit mines were investigated. Approximately 450 quarries were studied for their production tonnage, lease areas, mined rock type as well as mining methods and processing equipment. The results demonstrate that 90 % of the operations use truck-based transportation methods, with the remainder relying partly or completely on continuous conveyor-based systems. The installation of <b>continuous</b> <b>conveyors</b> compared to trucks represents a real alternative because of reduced dead load, reduced GHG emissions and in many cases even reduced costs.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{operation}} of a high volume conveyor sortation system are important due to its high cost, large footprint and {{critical role in the}} system. In this thesis, we study the characteristics of the conveyor sortation system from performance evaluation and design perspectives employing continuous modeling approaches. We present two <b>continuous</b> <b>conveyor</b> models (Delay and Stock Model and Batch on Conveyor Model) with different representation accuracy in a unified mathematical framework. Based on the Batch on Conveyor Model, we develop a fast fluid simulation methodology. We address the feasibility of implementing fluid simulation from modeling capabilities, algorithm design and simulation performance in terms of accuracy and simulation time. From a design perspective, we focus on rates determination and accumulation design in the accumulation and merge subsystem. The optimization problem is to find a minimum cost design that satisfies some predefined performance requirements under stochastic conditions. We first transform this stochastic programming problem into a deterministic nonlinear programming problem through sample path based optimization method. A gradient based method is adopted to solve the deterministic problem. Since there is no closed form for performance metric even for a deterministic input stream, we adopt continuous modeling to develop deterministic performance evaluation models and conduct sensitivity analysis on these models. We explore the prospects of using the two <b>continuous</b> <b>conveyor</b> models we presented. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Chen Zhou; Committee Member: Gunter Sharp; Committee Member: Leon F.

40|$|An {{emergency}} {{situation in a}} continuous transport system is an undesirable phenomenon during which the continuity of production or technological processes is seriously endangered. This situation can be brought about by various factors. In technological equipment of environmental <b>continuous</b> belt <b>conveyor</b> systems and pipe conveyors various adverse critical conditions may arise, which may result {{in the creation of}} an {{emergency situation}}. In particular, both conveyor and supporting rollers being the most significant components of the conveyor belt can substantially contribute to the onset of an emergency situation. Any damage to them can lead to a reduction or a complete standstill of the continuous transport process, which impedes upon the subsequent production operations. This contribution describes the possibility of the measurement and assessment of normal contact forces, which are applied by the conveyor belt to the supporting rollers on the hexagonal idler roller support of the pipe conveyors.

40|$|AbstractA {{production}} system {{consisting of a}} work station, a loading and unloading stations linked by a closed-loop material-handling system is considered. The material-handling system consists of two <b>continuous</b> line <b>conveyors.</b> Each conveyor is assumed to have a specified constant velocity, length and capacity. The work station is assumed to have a single machine, an unloading station and no local storage. In this {{production system}} the work pieces, which at their instant of arrival find the work station busy, are blocked. Those work pieces bypass the work station and are transported by the conveyor to the loading station to merge with the incoming work pieces to be transported to the work station again. The above production system is modeled by a G/G/ 1 / 0 queueing loss system with retrials, stationary counting arrival process, generally distributed service times, a single server and no waiting room. The flow of work pieces inside the system is modeled by a point process and is approximated by a renewal process. To analyze the asymptotic performance of the above system, a recursive procedure is developed. Furthermore, an expression for the asymptotic distribution {{of the number of}} work pieces along each conveyor is derived and is used to control the congestion along the material handling system. Finally numerical results are provided and compared against those from a simulation study...|$|R

40|$|Over-exposure to noise {{remains a}} widespread, serious health hazard in the U. S. mining {{industry}} despite 25 years of regulation. Most other categories of illnesses and injuries associated with mining have improved, {{with the exception}} of hearing loss. In order to reduce cases of Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL) in the mining industry, retrofit acoustic treatments and controls are being developed to subdue noise at the source.

40|$|Occupational noise-induced {{hearing loss}} {{continues}} {{to be one of}} the most pervasive health problems in the mining industry, despite over 25 years of regulation. One of the loudest pieces of equipment used in underground mining is the continuous mining machine. Noise sample data collected by the Mine Safety and Health Administration indicate that 42 % of noise overexposures between 2000 and 2005 involved continuous mining machine operators. Previously conducted field and laboratory tests have determined that the <b>continuous</b> mining machine <b>conveyor</b> system is a dominant noise source. Loud impacts occur as the conveyor chain flight bars, used to move the mined aggregate, traverse their path from the top to the underside of the conveyor deck. Various noise control treatments have been applied to abate noise caused by the conveyor system. A durable polyurethane coating has been developed for the conveyor flight bars, resulting in a time-weighted average reduction of 3 dB(A) for an eight-hour work shift. In an attempt to further reduce continuous mining machine operator overexposures, a similar urethane coating has been applied to the tail roller component of the conveyor system. Laboratory results showed a 2 dB(A) reduction in sound power levels, but the component failed during underground durability testing. An outer steel sleeve has been added to the urethane coating of the tail roller to enhance wear resistance during mining. The urethane jacketed tail roller is the latest effort, combined with previous noise treatments, to bring the continuous mining machine into compliance with federal noise regulations...|$|R
40|$|Recently a novel design {{concept of}} a reactor—the {{cascading}} pressure reactor—for the thermochemical fuel production, using a solar-driven redox cycle, was proposed. In this concept, thermal reduction of metal oxide particles is completed in multiple stages, at successively lower pressures. This leads to an order of Magnitude decrease in the pumping power demand as compared to a single stage, which in turn increases the solar to fuel efficiency. An important {{step in the process}} is the transfer of heat in the form of concentrated solar radiation to the particles, while providing reducing conditions in the space surrounding the particles. In this context, a novel system for heating and reducing particles, with a focus on operating at the small prototype scale (below 20 kW), is investigated. The key goals of the system are continuous operation, uniform heating of the reactive material, the ability to heat reactive material to 1723 K or higher, and flexibility of control. These criteria have led to the conceptual design of a <b>continuous</b> thin-layer particle <b>conveyor,</b> contained in an apertured, windowed cavity and enclosed in a vacuum chamber. This chamber, in combination with a water-splitting chamber and other System components, allows the possibility of testing multiple redox materials without any significant change in the reactor design.

The use of a unified design strategy has led to efficient development of the system. Experimental investigations of the horizontal motion plate allowed effective determination of motion profiles and bed uniformity. The most important factors determined through the modeling effort were the aperture diameter, which serves as the coupling point between the solar simulator lamp array and the cavity particle heating, and the particle bed thickness, which has a strong effect on the outlet temperature of the particles...|$|R

30|$|The mining {{industry}} {{is a very interesting}} case to take to explore this hypothesis further. Coalmining was a key industry in Japan’s economic development. At the end of WWI, the industry embarked upon a high-speed process to modernize its technology and labor management system. Basically, the sector stepped up its direct management of the workforce and promoted mechanization. Labor historian Hiroshi Hazama 6 describes this development at the large mines in four stages: 1) Ukeoi hanba sei: recruitment through an intermediary, working under the supervision of an intermediary, and daily life under the supervision of an intermediary; 2) Chokkatsu hanba sei: recruitment through an intermediary, directly supervised labor, and daily life under the supervision of an intermediary; 3) Sewayaku sei: recruitment under direct supervision, and work and daily life under the supervision of an intermediary; and 4) Chokuyôsei: recruitment under direct supervision, and labor and daily life under direct supervision. The timing of this last stage ranged from the 1930 s to just after World War Two, depending on the mine. The transition to direct management was obviously associated with the introduction of new technologies, which compelled employers to control skills more directly. The 1930 s saw the gradual introduction of mechanized drilling and a shift from the room-and-pillar system (tanchûshiki saitanhô) of extraction to the longwall system (chôhekishiki saitanhô). Under the former system, miners worked in pairs - usually {{a man and a woman}} - carving out “rooms” and leaving “pillars” of coal to support them. With the gradual shift to the longwall system, groups of miners large enough to be accompanied by a foreman, the mine hierarchy’s direct representative, worked a much larger coalface. At the beginning of the 1950 s, the large Japanese mines made another very important technological transition with the introduction of what was called Kappe mining (Kappe saitan). Steel pillars (kappe) with horizontal extensions held the ceiling in place on a larger section, leaving more room in front of the coalface. Heavier machinery such as shearing blades could therefore be used to slice left and right along the seam. Behind the blade, there was also room for a <b>continuous</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt to transfer the coal. The miners’ jobs were transformed as a greater division of labor developed and new skills were needed.|$|E
