40|$|To {{assess the}} {{importance}} of balloon material used for {{percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty}} (PTCA), we compared the complication rates observed with low complaint plastomer (PM 300), intermediately compliant polyethylene (PE 600), and highly compliant polyolefin copolymer (POC) balloons. In a total of 1, 650 procedures, one of these balloon materials was used to dilate 2, 040 lesions. The dissection rate tended to be slightly lower with the use of more <b>compliant</b> <b>balloon</b> material. The total clinical complication rate (death, emergency coronary surgery, myocardial infarction, need for bail-out stenting or for prolonged heparin treatment, abrupt out-of-laboratory vessel closure) was 8. 1 %, 7. 4 %, and 4. 2 % in the procedures exclusively performed with PM 300 (N = 653), PE 600 (N = 543) and POC (N = 454) balloons, respectively (P = 0. 03). In multivariate analysis, the use of less <b>compliant</b> <b>balloon</b> material emerged as an independent correlate of clinical complications (P = 0. 007). However, the predictive power of the lesion complexity (B 2, C versus A, B 1) was four times stronger.

40|$|Objective: We {{report on}} our {{experience}} using a <b>compliant</b> <b>balloon</b> {{for treatment of}} thrombi resistant to simple mechanical thrombolysis. Methods: We conducted a retrospective investigation of 46 consecutive acute ischemic stroke patients who were treated by intraarterial thrombolysis (IAT) between January 2008 and July 2010. We compared IAT results be-tween the balloon group (BG) and the simple mechanical thrombolysis (with microcatheter and microguidewire) group (SG). The Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) grading system was used for grading of the degrees of ves-sel recanalization. In addition, a modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score was used for post-IAT TIMI grade 2 patients. Modified Rankin Scale scores were used at three months for assessment of clinical outcomes. Results: Twenty of the 46 subjects were treated with a <b>compliant</b> <b>balloon.</b> The mean initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 15. 1 in the BG and 14 in the SG. The mean time from symptom onset to ini-tiation of IAT was 225 minutes in the BG and 177 in the SG (p = 0. 004). The overall rate of successful recanalization (TIMI grade 2 or 3) was 85 % in the BG and 73 % in the SG (p = 0. 476). In the TIMI grade 2 group, modified TICI 2 b was 90 % in the BG and 16 % in the SG (p = 0. 001). Postprocedure intraparenchymal hemorrhage occurred in two subjects in the BG and 10 subjects in the SG (p = 0. 029). No significant difference in clinical outcomes was observed between the BG and SG (p = 0. 347). Conclusions: The <b>compliant</b> <b>balloon</b> showed high potential for recanalization following acute ischemic stroke, especially when simple mechanical thrombol-ysis had failed.

40|$|Summary: We {{describe}} a remodeling technique {{in which two}} <b>compliant</b> <b>balloon</b> catheters were used to treat large, wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms distal to the circle of Willis in two patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Al-though vasospasm and interaction between the constrained catheters in the small distal arteries added to the complex-ity of the procedure, placement of a balloon catheter in each side branch prevented coil encroachment and enabled embolization of these aneurysms. Coiling of wide-necked aneurysms at vascular bi-furcations remains as a fundamental problem in in-terventional neuroradiology (1).

40|$|Background—Despite {{the routine}} use of high pressure, {{coronary}} stents generally fail {{to achieve a}} cross-sectional area (CSA). 60 % to 80 % of the nominal CSA of their dilating balloon. The extent to which incomplete balloon expansion and postdeflation stent recoil contribute to this failure has not been fully evaluated. Methods and Results—Thirty-two stents (8 Gianturco-Roubin II, 8 Palmaz-Schatz, 8 MultiLink, and 8 NIR) were deployed in nondiseased coronary arteries of 8 Yorkshire pigs. All stents were then expanded according to 1 of 3 balloon strategies: appropriately sized <b>compliant</b> <b>balloons,</b> oversized <b>compliant</b> <b>balloons,</b> or oversized noncompliant balloons. Continuous ultrasound imaging was performed during stepwise balloon inflation and deflation, with an 0. 018 -in imaging core positioned within the guidewire lumen of the balloon. In these normal arteries, balloon underexpansion relative to the nominal size was not observed. After balloon deflation, however, all stents showed significant recoil from their maximum inflated CSA. Recoil was significantly greater for the coil Gianturco-Roubin II stent (30 % CSA) than for the 3 slotted-tube stent designs (15 % to 17 % CSA). Conclusions—In normal, compliant coronary arteries, stent recoil is the predominant mechanism by which stents fail to achieve the nominal CSA of their dilating balloon. The magnitude of this in vivo stent recoil is significantly greater than reported from bench testing and varies with stent design (coil versus slotted tube). Postdilatation strategies that result in controlled stent overexpansion are needed to overcome this recoil phenomenon and result in a final stent CSA tha...|$|R

40|$|Endovascular {{aneurysm}} repair {{is being}} used increasingly to treat ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (RAAAs). Approximately 25 % of RAAAs undergo complete circulatory collapse before or during the procedure.

40|$|SUMMARY: Very {{large and}} giant (15 mm) {{cerebral}} aneurysms have a poor natural history, with {{high risk of}} subarachnoid hemorrhage or progressive symptoms of mass effect. Several endovascular techniques may be applied for treatment, depending on location, size, anatomy and presence of collateral circulation. The authors reviewed their clinical experience in endovascular treatment of 232 very large and giant aneurysms and present their perspective on {{the present state of}} the art in endovascular therapy for these aneurysms. Endovascular treatment of very large and giant intracranialaneurysms (15 mm) has largely replaced surgery during the past decades. Whereas surgery for many of these aneu-rysms is associated with substantial morbidity, 1 - 3 endovascu-lar treatment usually is straightforward with lowmorbidity. 4 - 7 New technical supportive devices such as <b>compliant</b> <b>balloons</b> and easy-to-place intracranial stents have facilitated endovas-cular treatment of wide-neck aneurysms. 8 - 10 In many centers, surgery for large and giant aneurysms is rarely performed.

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} an innovative technique to occlude distal backflow into a false lumen aneurysm by controlled rupture of the dissection membrane after stent-graft implantation. Technique: The ‘‘Knickerbocker technique’ ’ involves relining the true lumen in the descending aorta with an oversized thoracic tubular endograft, followed by controlled rupture of the dissection membrane using a large <b>compliant</b> <b>balloon</b> within the graft’s midsection. This maneuver, which allows {{expansion of the}} stent-graft’s midsection into the false lumen, was developed in order to occlude the large false lumen distally and thus prevent continued false lumen perfusion through distal abdominal entry tears. The technique has been successfully used in 3 patients with ruptured or symptomatic chronic false lumen aneurysm in type B aortic dissection. There was no short-term mortality associated with the procedure. After a mean follow-up of 8 months, the false lumen aneurysm remained thrombosed, with no mortality after a mean clinical follow-up of 22 months. Conclusion: The Knickerbocker technique appears to be feasible and effective in inducing false lumen thrombosis in selected patients who undergo stent-grafting for chronic type B aortic dissection...|$|E
40|$|Acute basilar artery (BA) {{occlusion}} {{is typically}} associated with poor outcome; however newer diagnostic and treatment modalities {{have the potential to}} improve prognosis. In this study, six patients with acute BA occlusion were followed and the effectiveness of local intra-arterial fibrinolysis (LIF) and subsequent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with a balloon catheter were assessed. Of the six patients with BA occlusion observed in this study, two had extended brain stem infarction on diffusion weighted image (DWI) and were treated conservatively. The other four patients received LIF at an average of 5. 2 hours from occlusion onset. Three of these four patients received additional PTA with <b>compliant</b> <b>balloon</b> catheters. All four of the patients who received LIF achieved recanalization of the BA trunk and showed a favorable clinical outcome. These findings suggest that LIF is beneficial for selected patients with BA occlusion and that successful recanalization is indicative of a good prognosis.

40|$|Suboptimal {{results of}} {{angioplasty}} procedures have been correlated to arterial damage during balloon inflation. We propose to monitor balloon inflation during the angioplasty procedure by detecting the balloon contours with intravascular {{optical coherence tomography}} (IVOCT). This will shed more light on {{the interaction between the}} balloon and the artery and to assess the artery's mechanical response. An automatic edge detection algorithm is applied for detection of the outer surface of an inflating balloon in a porcine artery in a beating heart experiment. A <b>compliant</b> <b>balloon</b> is inflated to deform the artery. IVOCT monitoring of balloon inflation is performed at a rate of 30 frames per second. During inflation, the balloon engages the arterial wall. Therefore, the characterization of the diameter of the inflated balloon leads to a characterization of the luminal diameter of the vessel. This provides precise information about the artery response to a simulated angioplasty procedure, information currently not provided by any other existing technique. In the current experiment, balloon inflation characterization is based on 356 IVOCT frames during which the estimated balloon diameter increases approximately from 1. 8 mm to 2. 9 mm.

To assess the effects of different antithrombotic therapies on thrombus deposition and early tissue reaction in stented coronary arteries we performed serial angioscopy in 20 consecutive pts who received Palmaz-Schatz coronary stent. Pts were randomized in a 3 : 1 ratio to receive either ticlopidine (250 mg t. i. d. 1 and aspirin (325 mg day) (Group 1, 15 pts) or continuous i. v. heparin (titrated to APTI of 60 – 100 seconds) combined with aspirin (325 mg day) and dipyridamole 175 mg t. i. d. 1 (Group 2, 5 pts), until the day 7 th. Long term treatment was only with ticlopidine and aspirin. Coronary angioscopy was performed pre stenting, immediately post implant (Imm), on day 7 th (Wk) and 2 months later (Mth).

Objectives and designto assess in a pilot study, the angiographic results and clinical outcome after bifurcation lesion stenting using NC balloons (Hiryu, Terumo) for Kiss. The default strategy was systematic use of 2 wires in 6 Fr guiding catheters, no SB predilatation, MB stenting using Sirolimus, Everolimus or Paclitaxel drug eluting stents followed by provisional SB stenting using 6 Fr. Pts with Medina 0, 0, 1 lesions, in-stent restenosis or left main disease were excluded. Results 100 bifurcation lesions were treated in 98 Pts. They were 67 ± 11 y-o, 78 % male, 22 % diabetics. Indication for PCI was silent ischemia in 23 %, stable angina 47 % and acute coronary syndrome 30 %. Transradial approach was used in 87 % of cases. Lesions were mainly located in LAD-diagonal bifurcation (50 %). Reference MB diameter was 3. 18 ± 0. 55 mm and SB 2. 28 ± 0. 40 mm. MB lesion length was 16. 3 ± 6. 6 mm and SB 2. 34 + 2. 18 mm. The MB was predilated in 49 % of cases and SB in 0 %. MB stent length was 22. 7 ± 6. 9 mm and diameter 3. 10 ± 0. 36 mm. Kiss was performed in all cases but in 3 SB dilatation through the MB stent with a small balloon was needed before Kiss. Optimal SB scaffolding by the MB stent was observed by “stent boost” in 89 % of cases. In the remaining, SB dissection or residual lesion > 70 % was observed and a SB stent was needed in 7 cases (7 %). In hospital outcome was uneventful.

40|$|Endovascular {{treatment}} of intracranial aneurysms by coiling {{has become an}} accepted alternative to surgical clipping 1. In cases of wide-necked and sidewall aneurysms, selective embolization is difficult {{because of the risk}} of coil protrusion into the parent vessel. The use of three-dimensional coils, stents 2, and balloon remodeling have all aided the attempt to adequately manage such lesions. However, compared with sidewall aneurysms, bifurcation aneurysms are more challenging from an endovascular standpoint.

The effects of the two types of balloon resulted in changes consisting in thinning of the entire arterial wall, reduction of the tunica media, distension of reticular fibers, presence of wide spaces between smooth muscle cells, stretching of smooth muscle cells, inner elastic lamina thickening. Both angioplasty devices used can modify the vascular wall. The identification of the tunica media structural damages might be useful in order to estimate the behavior of the vascular wall in the follow-up after angioplasty, because the entity of modifications could be predictive of restenosis that often takes place weeks or months after angioplasty...|$|E

A 65 -year-old male with recently diagnosed atrial septal defect was referred to our centre for decompensated right heart failure with rest and exercise induced dispnea and severe pulmonary hypertension. Right heart catheterization confirmed a mean pulmonary pressure of about 55 mmHg and a Qp/Qs of 2. 7. An occlusion test with a <b>compliant</b> large <b>balloon</b> demonstrated partial fall of pulmonary arterial pressure. The implantation of a home-made fenestrated Amplatzer ASD Occluder (ASO) was planned in order to decrease left-to-right shunt and promote further decrease of pulmonary arterial pressure in the long-term.

We describe the use of a new balloon device for assisting in wide-neck aneurysm coil treatment. Methods: A single institution neuroendovascular database was accessed to identify cases in which the Ascent balloon (Codman Neurovascular, Raynham, MA, USA) was used for aneurysm coil embolization. Clinical, demographic, and angiographic data were obtained through chart review. Results: Eleven cerebral aneurysm cases were treated using the Ascent balloon during the first 12 -month period that the new device was available at our institution. Three of the patients presented with ruptured aneurysms.

The tip of the thrombus, which was non-adherent to the caval wall, extended {{to the level of the}} hepatic veins. After complete dissection of the kidney, we obtained suprahepatic control of the IVC by a large <b>compliant</b> <b>balloon,</b> introduced through the right internal jugular vein and inflated just below the level of the diaphragm. The IVC thrombectomy was performed in a bloodless field. Mean blood pressure remained stable during IVC balloon inflation with a total occlusion time of 10 minutes.

The patient’s postoperative course was uncomplicated and, at the last follow-up, he had stable metastatic disease on sunitinib therapy. For the surgical treatment of RCC with retrohepatic IVC tumour extension, transjugular balloon occlusion of the suprahepatic IVC offers an alternative to extensive hepatic mobilization to obtain suprahepatic thrombus control. Advantages over traditional surgical methods may include decreased surgical time, lower risk of liver injury and tumour embolism. We suggest this method for further evaluation...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Whether minimal {{microvascular}} {{resistance of}} the myocardium {{is affected by the}} presence of an epicardial stenosis is controversial. Recently, an index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR) was developed that is based on combined measurements of distal coronary pressure and thermodilution-derived mean transit time. In normal coronary arteries, IMR orrelates well with true microvascular resistance. However, to be applicable {{in the case of an}} epicardial stenosis, IMR should account for collateral flow. We investigated the feasibility of determining IMR in humans and tested the hypothesis that microvascular resistance is independent of epicardial stenosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty patients scheduled for percutaneous coronary intervention were studied. The stenosis was stented with a pressure guidewire, and coronary wedge pressure (P(w)) was measured during balloon occlusion. After successful stenting, a short <b>compliant</b> <b>balloon</b> with a diameter 1. 0 mm smaller than the stent was placed in the stented segment and inflated with increasing pressures, creating a 10 %, 50 %, and 75 % area stenosis. At each of the 3 degrees of stenosis, fractional flow reserve (FFR) and IMR were measured at steady-state maximum hyperemia induced by intravenous adenosine. A total of 90 measurements were performed in 30 patients.

40|$|Summary: A new, very {{compliant}} remodeling balloon microcatheter {{has been}} developed {{for the treatment of}} difficult wide-neck intracranial aneurysms (eg, arterial bifurcation or small artery aneurysms). We report selec-tive embolization by the use of the remodeling technique with the HyperForm balloon in 16 consecutive patients with a wide-neck intracranial aneurysm located on an arterial bifurcation or a small artery or both. Endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms by endosaccular coiling has become an accepted al-ternative to surgical clipping (1). In cases of wide-neck aneurysms, selective embolization is difficult be-cause of the risk of coil protrusion into the parent vessel. Several authors (2 – 6) have reported successful treatment of these aneurysms by using the “remodel-ing technique ” (2). A small balloon-occlusion micro-catheter is used to protect the parent artery lumen during coil deployment within the lesion.

40|$|AIMS: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of increase in left ventricular (LV) pressure on repolarization and activation-recovery intervals. METHODS AND RESULTS: Six pig hearts were Langendorff-perfused. A <b>compliant</b> liquid-filled <b>balloon,</b> connected with a pressure transducer, inserted through the mitral orifice, could be filled until the required LV systolic pressure was obtained. A grid of 121 electrodes (11 × 11; 5 mm interelectrode distance) was sutured on the LV free wall. Ventricular pacing at 600 ms and at 400 or 450 ms was either performed from the LV wall or from the ventricular septum. Under all these four conditions, the pressure wave occurred at the same moment relative to the onset of the QRS complex. Consequently, the time relation between local repolarization and the pressure wave differed between the various pacing sites. Repolarization times (RTs) at a cycle length (CL) of 600 ms were prolonged by increased pressure. With stimulation from the LV, when the pressure wave coincides with the action potentials (APs) late in their phase (sites with relatively early repolarization), an increase in pressure from 0 to 100 mmHg delayed repolarization more than with stimulation from the septum, when the pressure wave occurs at a relatively earlier phase of the AP (sites with relatively late repolarization). At pacing at CL 400 / 450 ms, an increase in pressure caused RT prolongation at the LV free wall during LV stimulation, but less RT prolongation or even shortening during septal stimulation.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of increase in left ventricular (LV) pressure on repolarization and activation-recovery intervals. Six pig hearts were Langendorff-perfused. A <b>compliant</b> liquid-filled <b>balloon,</b> connected with a pressure transducer, inserted through the mitral orifice, could be filled until the required LV systolic pressure was obtained. A grid of 121 electrodes (11 × 11; 5 mm interelectrode distance) was sutured on the LV free wall. Ventricular pacing at 600 ms and at 400 or 450 ms was either performed from the LV wall or from the ventricular septum. Under all these four conditions, the pressure wave occurred at the same moment relative to the onset of the QRS complex. Consequently, the time relation between local repolarization and the pressure wave differed between the various pacing sites. Repolarization times (RTs) at a cycle length (CL) of 600 ms were prolonged by increased pressure. With stimulation from the LV, when the pressure wave coincides with the action potentials (APs) late in their phase (sites with relatively early repolarization), an increase in pressure from 0 to 100 mmHg delayed repolarization more than with stimulation from the septum, when the pressure wave occurs at a relatively earlier phase of the AP (sites with relatively late repolarization).

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the feasibility of}} cerebral protection during carotid artery stenting (CAS) using the Mo. Ma device, which prevents cerebral embolization by proximal endovascular blockage of blood flow in {{the internal and external}} carotid arteries. METHODS: In 14 European centers, 157 patients (121 men; mean age 68. 0 +/- 8. 3 years) were enrolled in a prospective registry between March 2002 and March 2003. Eligible patients had a symptomatic (> 50 %) or asymptomatic (> 70 %) stenosis of the internal carotid artery suitable for carotid stenting. Protected carotid stenting was performed with the Mo. Ma system, which occludes both the common and external carotid arteries via 2 independently inflatable <b>compliant</b> low-pressure <b>balloons</b> before any device is advanced across the lesion. Blood is aspirated through the catheter intermittently or {{at the end of the}} procedure. RESULTS: The device was successfully positioned and stents were implanted in all cases. Diameter stenosis was reduced from 84. 1 %+/- 7. 8 % to 6. 7 %+/- 5. 1 %. The mean duration of flow blockage was 7. 6 +/- 5. 9 minutes. In 12 (7. 6 %) patients, transient intolerance to flow blockade was observed, but the procedures were completed successfully. In 124 (79. 6 %) cases, there was macroscopic evidence of debris after filtering the aspirated blood. In-hospital complications included 4 (2. 5 %) minor strokes, 8 (5. 1 %) transient ischemic attacks, no deaths, and no major strokes, resulting in a 2. 5 % death/stroke rate at discharge. At 30 -day follow-up, there was 1 cardiac death, 1 major stroke, and 3 minor strokes, for an overall 5. 7 % 30 -day death/stroke rate and a 30 -day major stroke and death rate of 1. 3 %. CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral protection with proximal endovascular blood flow blockage during CAS is feasible, with a high procedural success rate...|$|R
40|$|Background—Whether minimal {{microvascular}} {{resistance of}} the myocardium {{is affected by the}} presence of an epicardial stenosis is controversial. Recently, an index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR) was developed that is based on combined measurements of distal coronary pressure and thermodilution-derived mean transit time. In normal coronary arteries, IMR correlates well with true microvascular resistance. However, to be applicable {{in the case of an}} epicardial stenosis, IMR should account for collateral flow. We investigated the feasibility of determining IMR in humans and tested the hypothesis that microvascular resistance is independent of epicardial stenosis. Methods and Results—Thirty patients scheduled for percutaneous coronary intervention were studied. The stenosis was stented with a pressure guidewire, and coronary wedge pressure (Pw) was measured during balloon occlusion. After successful stenting, a short <b>compliant</b> <b>balloon</b> with a diameter 1. 0 mm smaller than the stent was placed in the stented segment and inflated with increasing pressures, creating a 10 %, 50 %, and 75 % area stenosis. At each of the 3 degrees of stenosis, fractional flow reserve (FFR) and IMR were measured at steady-state maximum hyperemia induced by intravenous adenosine. A total of 90 measurements were performed in 30 patients. When uncorrected for Pw, an apparent increase in microvascular resistance was observed with increasing stenosis severity (IMR 24, 27, and 37 U for the 3 different degrees of stenosis; P 0. 001). In contrast, when Pw is appropriately accounted for, microvascular resistance did not change with stenosis severity (IMR 22, 23, and 23 U, respectively; P 0. 28) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective: Our {{objective}} was to test the effects of exogenous l-aspartate and l-glutamate on myocardial energy metabolism during ischemia-reperfusion. Methods: Phosphorus 31 –magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to observe cellular energetics and intracellular pH in isolated pig hearts perfused with blood (group A, n = 8) or blood enriched with 13 mmol/L each of l-aspartate and l-glutamate (group B, n = 6). The hearts were subjected to 30 minutes of total normothermic ischemia and then reperfused for 40 minutes. Two hearts from each group were inotropically stimulated by titration with calcium after normokalemic reperfusion. Left ventricular function was measured {{with the use of}} a <b>compliant</b> <b>balloon</b> and oxygen consumption was calculated. Results: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed no decrease in the rate of energy decline during ischemia for group B versus group A. No significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of myocardial function, oxygen consumption, or the rate or extent of high-energy phosphate recovery after normokalemic reperfusion or inotropic stimulation. Inotropic stimulation of postischemic hearts, however, led to dramatic improvement in myocardial function in both groups (p < 0. 05 for all parameters) and significant improvement in oxygen consumption (p = 0. 01). Conclusions: In a normal, isolated, blood-perfused pig heart subjected to 30 minutes of total normothermic ischemia, (1) enrichment of the perfusate with aspartate/glutamate before and after ischemia affects neither myocardial energy metabolism during ischemia-reperfusion nor postischemic recovery of myocardial function or oxygen consumption and (2) inotropic stimulation can recruit significant postischemic function and sufficient aerobic respiration to support it, irrespective of aspartate/glutamate enrichment.

40|$|In the {{treatment}} of early esophageal Barrett's neoplasia, radiofrequency ablation may be hindered by stenosis due to prior endoscopic resection (ER). The flexible balloon-based circumferential CryoBalloon Ablation System (CBAS) may overcome this problem by the conformability of the <b>compliant</b> <b>balloon</b> which might enable circumferential cryoablation in a stenosis. The aim {{of the current study}} was to evaluate the feasibility of the CBAS as well as the dose-response effect of cryoablation in a strictured esophagus model. In six pigs, a stenosis was induced by ER (3 [*]cm in length, 75 % of circumference) in the proximal, mid, and distal esophagus. After 28 days, cryoablation with the CBAS was performed, with the length of ablation time (6, 8, or 10 seconds) randomly assigned per stricture location within the esophagus. Four days post-ablation, the esophagi were harvested for histopathological assessment of the percentage of the total circumference affected by cryoablation and the maximum depth of necrosis. At 28 days, all 18 ER areas had transformed into strictures with ± 50 % of its original diameter remaining. In 9 of 18 strictures, more than one attempt for cryoablation was necessary due to displacement of the balloon. Histopathological evaluation showed a wide range in circumferential uniformity (0 - 100 %) and maximum necrosis depth (epithelium to external proper muscle layer) of cryoablation, both independent of ablation times. Deepest ablation effects were seen {{at the center of the}} resection-induced scar. This first generation CryoBalloon Focal Ablation System was not feasible for ablation within severe stenoses, since it results in inconsistent circumferential uniformity of cryoablation with subsequent differences in depth of ablation. Further research with a next generation CBAS in a more realistic stricture model is warrante...|$|E
40|$|IntroductionInstent {{restenosis}} (ISR) {{remains the}} weak point of coronary angioplasty despite {{the advent of}} drug-eluting stents. The drug eluting balloon (DEB), which in contact of the artery wall releases an antiproliferative agent, could be an option to treat ISR or some de novo lesions. MethodsBetween October 2013 and December 2014 in our center, all patients treated with DEB for RIS or de novo lesions were identified. ISR {{was defined as a}} stenosis of more than 50 % or a measuring FFR≤ 0, 8 to a site previously treated by stent. The lesion was first treated by <b>compliant</b> <b>balloon</b> then DEB (SeQuent Please® laboratory Braun® B) was inflated for 30 seconds and then removed. Angiographic control was achieved and, in case of incomplete result or complication, a stent could be implanted. ResultsAmong the 48 patients treated with DEB, 23 were for ISR and 25 for de novo lesions. The average age of patients was 75. 7 years. 31 % of patients were part of a long-term anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation. The clinical presentation was mostly a stable angina (62 %). In 26 % of ISR, there was in DES restenosis, the average time of ISR was 2 years± 3. 9. The average diameter of the DEB used was 2. 4 mm± 0. 4 for an average length of 17 mm± 4. 7 mm. For five patients (10 %) has a complement of stent implantation (DES in 60 % of cases). The double antiaggregation was continued during 3. 8 months. In-hospital, one death appeared. In the mean follow up of 6. 5 months (maximum one year) no deaths were reported. After revascularization 8 % of patients had a clinical relapse, 12. 5 % had a positive ischemic test. In 10. 4 % of cases, a significant rest-enosis in angioplasty site DEB (TLR) has been highlighted, and requiring a new revascularization. The average period for TLR was 7. 6 months± 4. ConclusionThe DEB is a safe option mainly for ISR and for small caliber arteries, or bifurcation lesions or in the elderly or in long-term anticoagulation. The clinical course is often satisfactory...|$|E
40|$|Precipitating liquid embolics {{used for}} {{embolization}} of cerebral aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations {{are based on}} solutions of preformed polymers dissolved in organic, water-miscible solvents. Following intravascular injection, the liquid embolic precipitates and forms a nonadhesive solid cast due to a rapid exchange of the solvent with surrounding physiological fluids. We have developed a new precipitating liquid embolic, composed of a biocompatible polymer dissolved in organic solvents. In addition, we have evaluated CT-angiography (CTA) for volumetry of such embolized aneurysms. The following results were achieved: 1. Iodinated polyvinyl alcohol (I-PVAL) resembles a newly developed polymer proportion of precipitating liquid embolics. The main innovation of this polymer in comparison to known embolics is the intrinsic radiopacity without the need of radiopaque admixtures. Thus, no preparation before use is necessary. We have demonstrated that embolisation of porcine carotid artery sidewall aneurysms with a highly viscous mixture of I-PVAL dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), {{the most commonly used}} organic solvent for precipitating liquid embolics, was feasible with a high initial occlusion rate. Moreover, I-PVAL is the first neuroendovascular embolisation material not to produce artifacts on CT or MRI of embolized aneurysms. 2. Concerns exist for the use of DMSO as a solvent proportion of precipitating liquid embolics from a toxicological standpoint. Especially worrisome is the observation that rapid intraarterial injection in swine rete mirabile regularly lead to vasospasm with fatal clinic consequences. In a comparative study in swine rete mirabile we were able to identify other organic solvents, which were far less angiotoxic than DMSO after intraarterial injection. The substances with the most promising angiotoxic profiles were dimethylsulfoxide (DMI) and n-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP). 3. We have synthesized another liquid embolic, which combines the advantages of the intrinsically radiopaque polymer I-PVAL with those of the low angiotoxic solvent NMP. We have demonstrated that embolisation of porcine carotid artery sidewall aneurysms was feasible with a high initial occlusion rate due to the good and homogeneous radiopacity and favourable precipitation pattern of this liquid embolic. 4. A systematic in vitro analysis of different reconstruction methods for volume determination of phantoms of intracranial aneurysms using 16 -row multislice CTA was performed. This was the first investigation to show that volumetric assessment of such complex three dimensional structures is feasible with CTA. The lowest deviations were found for an automated volume analysis tool on volume-rendered reconstructions. 5. A considerable volume increase of over 60 % of experimental aneurysms, which were embolized with I-PVAL immediately after their surgical construction, was found by CTA volumetry. This observation was most likely the result of a shortcoming of this aneurysm model. The concern of an intraaneurysmal pressure increase during injection of liquid embolics and temporary balloon occlusion of the parent artery was ruled out by in-vitro experiments with assessment of intraaneurysmal pressure. On the other hand, open spaces along the microcatheter remain despite maximal inflation of a <b>compliant</b> <b>balloon,</b> which constitute the preferred route of liquid embolic migration into the parent artery...|$|E
