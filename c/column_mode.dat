50|$|<b>Column</b> <b>Mode</b> editing was {{probably}} unique to WordStar. As a basic text editor, the interface showed all characters {{to be the}} same width - hence 80 characters across an 80 column screen resolution. By switching on <b>column</b> <b>mode</b> editing a rectangle of text spanning several characters and several lines could be selected and manipulated. This was very handy for manipulating columns of numbers and non-standard files. Once selected, the feature could also be used to calculate the total of a column of numbers and place the result at the insertion point.|$|E

5000|$|The VT100 was {{introduced}} in August 1978, replacing the VT50/VT52 family.

Basic improvements on the VT52 included a 132 <b>column</b> <b>mode,</b> {{and a variety of}} [...] "graphic renditions" [...] including blinking, bolding, reverse video, and underlining. The VT100 also introduced an additional box-drawing character set containing various pseudographics that allowed the drawing of on-screen forms. All setup of the VT100 was accomplished using interactive displays presented on the screen; the setup data was stored in non-volatile memory within the terminal. Maintainability was also significantly improved since a VT100 could be disassembled quickly without use of tools.|$|E

40|$|The {{nature of}} the {{instability}} governing the self-sustained tones produced by a low Mach number free plane jet impinging on a slotted plate, known as slot-tone, is identified experimentally. The experimental apparatus permits to control the Reynolds number and {{the distance from the}} jet outlet to the plate. For a Reynolds number, the shear-layer natural frequency and the jet <b>column</b> <b>mode</b> frequency of the free jet without the obstacle are estimated and compared to the minimal and maximal frequencies of the tones (for any position of the plate). The frequency of both instabilities defines the frequency domain of the self sustained tones. The lowest frequencies of the tones, obtained when the plate is placed downstream the end of the potential core, are the result of the amplification of the <b>column</b> <b>mode</b> frequency. On the other hand, the maximal frequency of the tones, obtained when the plate is situated near the jet outlet, is close to the natural shear-layer frequency. Moreover, when the tones frequency is higher than the natural shear-layer frequency, the sound pressure level produced is very inferior to the maximal sound pressure level measured at the same Reynolds number. This confirms the prominent role of the shear-layer instability in the self-sustained tones process for the highest frequencies. Tones with a frequency lower than the jet <b>column</b> <b>mode</b> frequency are rarely observed. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|X-ray {{emission}} from pinch plasma devices with pinch currents {{ranging from}} 200 to 400 kA operated with pure high-Z gases are investigated with temporal spatial and spectral resolution. If operated using elements Z less than 18 (e. g., nitrogen or neon) K-shell emission is observed from column-like volumes several 100 micrometer {{in diameter and}} several mm in length (bulk or <b>column</b> <b>mode).</b> For Z greater than 18. (e. g., krypton or xenon) emission with hv grater than 1 keV is only observed from micropinches. For argon (Z = 18) both modes of operation can be observed. The occurrence of a specific mode depends on the initial gas pressure. In this paper the transition regime between column and micropinches is investigated with particular regard to argon. A criterion is proposed to decide whether <b>column</b> <b>mode</b> or micropinch mode is expected...|$|E

40|$|Current {{practice}} of analytical and test methods {{related to the}} analysis, testing and improvement of vehicle vibrations is overviewed. The methods are illustrated on the determination and improvement of powertrain induced steering wheel vibration of a heavy commercial truck. More specifically, the transmissibility of powertrain idle vibration to cabin is investigated with respect to powertrain rigid body modes and modal alignment of the steering column/wheel system is considered. It is found out that roll mode of the powertrain is not separated from idle excitation for effective vibration isolation as well as steering wheel <b>column</b> <b>mode</b> {{is close to the}} 3 rd engine excitation frequency order, which results in high vibration levels. Powertrain roll mode is optimized by tuning the powertrain mount stiffness to improve the performance. Steering <b>column</b> <b>mode</b> is also separated from the 3 rd engine excitation frequency by the application of a mass absorber. It is concluded that the use of analytical and test methods to address the complex relation between design parameters and powertrain idle response is effective to optimize the system performance and evaluate the trade-offs in the vehicle design such as vibration performance and weight.
