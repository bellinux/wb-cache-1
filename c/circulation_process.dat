30|$|The article {{contains}} {{analysis of the}} interrelation of <b>circulation</b> <b>processes</b> in the atmosphere with the change of runoff in the basins of rivers. The results of estimates which show the relationship of <b>circulation</b> <b>processes</b> in the atmosphere with the runoff of the zone of formation of one of southern regions of Kazakhstan are discussed. The typification of <b>circulation</b> <b>processes</b> by B. L. Dzerdzeyevskiy and previously made estimates of water resources in the basins of rivers of South Kazakhstan were assumed as a basis. Certain areas were considered in this work: the Ile-Balkash basin, basin of rivers Shu-Talas and basin of the Syrdariya river, each basin is considered separately, since the runoff varies by regions and by the value of fluctuations, it is not permanent, because of the various factors of runoff formation in individual basins of that region. The calculations performed have shown {{the possibility of using}} typification of elementary circulation mechanism (ECM) for further researches of climatic changes, including to determine the direction of change of river runoff in other river basins. The created database on annual values of each of the 41 types of ECM can be used in other studies as well.|$|R

During the fall of 1982, a computer center was opened in what had been Waterfield Library's smoking lounge. It contained twelve terminals, two printers, and was free for use by students and faculty. Since then, Waterfield Library has expanded its computing area to include 60 desktop computers and offers 50 laptops for students to utilize. In 1992, the library changed its <b>circulation</b> <b>process</b> to an electronic system, which allowed students to use the public terminals to search for books and add themselves to electronic waiting lists.|$|E
5000|$|In Capital, Volume III, Marx {{considers}} {{the operation of}} capitalist production as the unity of a production process and a <b>circulation</b> <b>process</b> involving commodities, money, and capital. Capitalist production cannot exist without market sales, and therefore it {{is a type of}} production that fully depends on market trade. For the purpose of the analysis of the immediate process of capitalist production, which is the main subject of Capital, Volume I, successful market transactions are assumed and market fluctuations are initially mostly disregarded - but that gives only one half of the story. The products have to be sold at a profit, and purchased at a competitive price, through market trade and the circulation of capital.|$|E
5000|$|Nevertheless, the {{start-up}} process commenced with the Night Lead Operator on the March 22 {{with the initial}} filling of the splitter tower. The level transmitter was designed to indicate the raffinate level within a 5 ft span {{from the bottom of}} the splitter tower to a 9 ft level, i.e., 72% level indication would be 7.6 ft from the bottom, but it was common practice to fill up to an indicated level of 99%, even though the procedural requirement was stated as 50%. The Day Supervisor arrived late for work and did not have a hand-over with the night shift. During the morning meeting on March 23, it was discussed that the heavy raffinate storage tanks were nearly full and, therefore, the second Day Supervisor was told that {{the start-up}} procedure should not continue, but this information was not passed on. The start-up procedure resumed just before 9:30 a.m. under instructions from the other Day Supervisor. Before recommencing the tower refill and <b>circulation</b> <b>process,</b> heavy raffinate was drained {{from the bottom of the}} tower via the level control valve into the heavy storage tank and was then shut off in [...] "manual" [...] mode and not the required [...] "automatic" [...] mode, with a 50% flow rate. The <b>circulation</b> <b>process</b> was restarted just before 10 a.m. and raffinate was once again fed into the tower, even though the level was already too high. Since the level control valve was shut and, therefore, there was no circulation out of the tower, i.e. no heavy raffinate being transferred to the storage tank, the splitter tower inevitably began to fill up. The defective level transmitter continued to show the level at less than 100%, and since the external sight glass was opaque, a visual check to verify the level in the splitter tower was not possible.|$|E

For the basin of river Shu, the obtained connection coefficients are considerably lower, than for the basin of the Talas river. With the lag of the series of runoff relative to ECM for 2 – 5  years for the period of observations from 1950 to 2002 sufficiently good (0.7 – 0.9) the connection coefficients were not available.

As with most newspaper companies in the United States, OSC management was confronted with unprecedented disruptive change and challenges by the accelerated evolution of its business models and processes. This investigation identified and modeled OSC <b>circulation</b> <b>processes</b> to support disruptive change initiatives. The XML Process Definition Language (XPDL) is an XML specification and process modeling solution developed by the Workflow Management Coalition (WFMC) designed to exchange workflow process semantics and graphics. This investigation focused on developing an XPDL process model of OSC <b>circulation</b> <b>processes</b> to address process transformations inherent to disruptive change. The method was {{a case study of}} OSC <b>circulation</b> <b>processes</b> through the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) framework to develop a reproducible XPDL process model for OSC to use in planning for disruptive change.

The way economists think that money functions at the macro-level of society as a whole, differs a lot from the way they say money functions at the level of individuals. They have one story for transactions between individuals, and quite another story for the [...] "big picture". According to Marxist, classical and post-Keynesian economists such as Wynne Godley, Marc Lavoie, Steve Keen, Edward J. Nell and Anwar Shaikh, this creates all kinds of theoretical inconsistencies. To overcome the inconsistencies, post-Keynesian Marxists try to create a so-called [...] "stock/flow consistent model" [...] of monetary transactions, which can explain the <b>circulation</b> <b>process</b> of money, commodities and capital in an integral way. This approach is needed especially because [...] "unfortunately, the finance sector is one of the more poorly measured sectors in national accounts".|$|E

The individual lamellae of the gills lie {{on either side of the}} septum. The base of the arch may also support gill rakers, small projecting elements that help to filter food from the water.|$|E
50|$|Another former {{president}} of the American Economic Association, Georgescu-Roegen, also began to dissent from orthodox economics for reasons not dissimilar to Boulding. In his classic work, The Entropy Law and the Economic Process, Georgescu-Roegen issued a call {{for the end of the}} circular flow diagrams used in mainstream thought and textbooks in which the production and <b>circulation</b> <b>process</b> are detached from the physical reality, the scale, of the planet's resources and pollution sinks. He called for greater attention to be given to the second law of thermodynamics - that it be treated as a cornerstone of the mainstream paradigm. Boulding can be seen as addressing this call. Once one considers the possibility that labor can be seen as an intermediate surrogate for more fundamental factors, like know-how, materials and energy, then it is a short step to treat (as Boulding sometimes does) capital as a surrogate for know-how and land as surrogate for material resources and the traditional factors of production, land, labor and capital, are easily rearticulated as know-how, energy and materials. If and when that sort of transformation in thought takes place, professional attention will immediately be focused on the throughput resulting from the production and consumption process. With the rising perception of environmental degradation and the unrelenting thrust of the environmental movement, there is every reason to expect the profession to include throughput as a centerpiece in the production process. Boulding's factors of production accomplish this task.|$|E
