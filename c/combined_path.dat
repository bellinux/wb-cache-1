40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we develop}} an {{analytical}} framework {{to quantify the}} effects of the spreading bandwidth (BW) on spread spectrum systems operating in dense multipath environments in terms of the receiver performance, the receiver complexity, and the multipath channel parameters. The focus of the paper is to characterize the symbol error probability (SEP) performance of a Rake receiver tracking the strongest multipath components in wide-sense stationary uncorrelated scattering (WSSUS) Gaussian channels with frequency-selective fading. Analytical SEP expres-sions of the Rake receiver are derived {{in terms of the number}} of <b>combined</b> <b>paths,</b> the spreading BW, and the multipath spread of the channel. The proposed problem is made analytically tractable by transforming the physical Rake paths, which are correlated and ordered, into the domain of a “virtual Rake ” receiver with indepen-dent virtual paths. This results in a simple derivation of the SEP for a given spreading BW and an arbitrary number of <b>combined</b> <b>paths.</b> Index Terms—Dispersive channels, diversity methods, fading channels, maximal ratio combining, Rake receiver, selection diversity, spreading bandwidth, spread spectrum techniques, virtual path technique.

The evolution of the Internet and differentiated services has expanded the scope of the global information infrastructure and increased connectivity among service providers and clients requesting services for multimedia applications. As this infrastructure scales, service providers will need to replicate data and resources on the network to serve more concurrent clients. Efficient and adaptive resource management mechanisms are required to deal with highly dynamic environments (e. g. those that involve mobile clients and hosts). Quality of Service (QoS) routing techniques have been proposed to improve the network utilization by balancing the load among the individual network links. Server selection policies direct the user to the “best ” server while statically treating the network path leading from the client to the server as pre-determined by the routing tables, even though there may exist multiple alternative paths.

40|$|Adaptive {{modulation}} {{and diversity}} combining represent very important adaptive solutions {{for future generations}} of wireless communication systems. Indeed, {{in order to improve}} the performance and the efficiency of these systems, these two techniques have been recently used jointly in new schemes named joint adaptive modulation and diversity combining (JAMDC) schemes. Considering the problem of finding low hardware complexity, bandwidth-efficient, and processing-power efficient transmission schemes for a downlink scenario and capitalizing on some of these recently proposed JAMDC schemes, we propose and analyze in this paper three joint adaptive modulation, diversity combining, and power control (JAMDCPC) schemes where a constant-power variable-rate adaptive modulation technique is used with an adaptive diversity combining scheme and a common power control process. More specifically, the modulation constellation size, the number of <b>combined</b> diversity <b>paths,</b> and the needed power level are jointly determined to achieve the highest spectral efficiency with the lowest possible processing power consumption quantified in terms of the average number of <b>combined</b> <b>paths,</b> given the fading channel conditions and the required bit error rate (BER) performance. In this paper, the performance of these three JAMDCPC schemes is analyzed in terms of their spectral efficiency, processing power consumption, and error-rate performance. Selected numerical examples show that these schemes considerably increase the spectral efficiency of the existing JAMDC schemes with a slight increase in the average number of <b>combined</b> <b>paths</b> for the low signal-to-noise ratio range while maintaining compliance with the BER performance and a low radiated power which yields to a substantial decrease in interference to co-existing users and systems. © 2011 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. With the {{increasing}} use of XML, considerable research is being conducted on the XML document management systems for more efficient storage and searching of XML documents. Depending on the base systems, these researches can be classified into object-oriented DBMS (OODBMS) and relational DBMS (RDBMS). OODBMS-based systems are better suited to reflect the structure of XML-documents than RDBMS-based ones. However, using an XML parser to map the contents of documents to relational tables is a better way to construct a stable and effective XML document management system. The proposed X-Binder system uses an RDBMS-based inverted index; this guarantees high searching speed but wastes considerable storage space. To avoid this, the proposed system incorporates a <b>path</b> <b>combining</b> module agent that <b>combines</b> <b>paths</b> with sibling relations, and stores them in a single row.
