The transition to a qualitatively new level of analysis involves the dynamic models use. In this case it is possible to set the required control time, laws to reduce the entropy of the <b>control</b> <b>object,</b> the relationship between the main parameters of the process control. Problem statement. Entropy is the objective characteristic of control precision. The collection of previously collected data on the properties of the <b>control</b> <b>object,</b> disturbances and other factors form the original information. Working information is extracted in the control process. The required amount of information to reduce the <b>control</b> <b>object</b> entropy it enables to consider the process of radio control in the dynamics. The radio control dynamic model (the dynamic equation), which reveals the laws of change of the <b>control</b> <b>object</b> entropy in conditions of the control information absence and the control information availability necessary to make. It should take into consideration that the <b>control</b> <b>object</b> entropy value and the control information amount reaches a certain limit value. The model should give the opportunity {{to take into account the}} basic radio characteristics of the <b>control</b> <b>object</b> channel. Theoretical results. A dynamic model which takes into account the relationship between the rate of change of <b>control</b> <b>object</b> entropy and the amount of information that goes on the control channel was proposed. The constant rate of object entropy increase in the control absence and the constant rate of object entropy decrease in the control organization were considered. Restrictions on the potentially possible entropy values and the information amount were included. The steady state situation was analyzed. The time during which the control process can be accomplished was established. The requirement to the relation between the entropy potential value and the quantity of information was determined. The relation between the relative error of the radio control, the <b>control</b> <b>object</b> entropy value and the starting information was established. Conclusion. The results make it possible to determine the pattern of the <b>control</b> <b>object</b> entropy change, both in terms of receipt control information, and if it is the reduction in a contingency situation. On the basis of the entropy analysis procedures set a limit on the relative radio control errors, required time and the maximum value of the <b>control</b> <b>object</b> entropy. Hourly and the entropy limit for the radio control process take account the radio control channel characteristics, channel bandwidth, signal power, noise power, and the relative error of control. ?? ????????? ????????????????? ??????? ? ??????? ???????? ??????????????? ?????????? ???????????? ??????, ??????? ????????? ??????????? ????? ????????? ????????? ???????? ??????? ?????????? ? ??????????? ??????????, ??????? ????????? ?? ?????? ??????????. ?????? ????????? ???????? ?????????? ???????? ??????? ??? ?????????? ?????????? ? ????????? ???????? ?????????? ???????? ? ???????? ??????????? ???????? ??????????. ??????????? ??????????? ?? ???????????? ????????? ???????? ???????? ? ?????????? ??????????. ???????????????? ???????? ??????????????? ??????. ??????????? ?????, ?? ??????? ??????? ?????????? ????? ???? ????????. ?????????? ?????????? ? ??????????? ????? ???????????? ????????? ????????? ???????? ? ??????????? ??????????. ??????????? ??????????? ????? ????????????? ??????? ???????????????, ????????? ???????? ??????? ?????????? ? ????????? ???????????. ?? ????????? ? ??????????? ???????????? ?? ??????? ??????????????? ?????? ?????? ??????????? ?????? ??????????, ???????? ??????? ? ???????? ????...|$|E

This increases the possibility to report different status than actual progress, especially in large and multidisciplinary construction projects with high complexity. Could the project plan be related to a building information model (BIM) and could project progress reported directly from the BIM {{lead to a more}} accurate, consistent and coordinated status? This paper assesses how object status in the BIM can be related to milestones in a project plan. Findings are based on experiences from the oil and gas industry. Data is gathered from case projects in Kvaerner, a Norwegian EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) contractor. The paper examines how a project plan can be connected to a BIM, focusing on the benefits and possibilities of adding status to objects in the BIM and how project progress can be reported and visualized using BIM.

40|$|Modern {{complicated}} dynamic {{objects are}} {{a set of}} related subsystems with parameters and structure, which may vary in different operating modes. For adaptation to structural-parametric changes in multivariable <b>controlled</b> <b>object</b> the logical <b>control</b> algorithms are often used. They can significantly improve the dynamic and static properties of the system. However, existing logical control algorithms do {{not take into account}} a dynamics of the <b>controlled</b> <b>object.</b> Therefore, calculation of parameters for the logical controller is required to ensure the specified quality of control processes. Thus, there is a relevant problem of synthesis of the logical control algorithms that take into account the change of parameters and structure of the <b>controlled</b> <b>object.</b> A solution of this problem will allow us to overcome the contradiction between accuracy, stability, and performance. The article proposes a mathematical model of the logical algorithm to control the autonomous separate subsystem by the error signal and its derivative. This algorithm creates a logically correcting error based on the analysis of the current state and dynamics of a separate subsystem. The article offers a comparative analysis of the existing logical control algorithm with synthesized one when structural-parametric characteristic of <b>controlled</b> <b>object</b> has been changed. Existing algorithms of logic control accelerate dynamics of autonomous separate subsystem thus leading to a significant deterioration in the quality of transition processes. The synthesized logic control algorithm stabilizes dynamics of autonomous separate subsystem and provides a required quality of control processes.

Parametric disturbances have influence on control variables and on <b>control</b> <b>object</b> properties, in particular on its transition coefficient. In this case, character of transient processes change, i. e. free motion component of the system. Spectral density of control variable changes, under the influence of transition coefficient change, has its peak, in general, in mid-frequency range. In the case, when using filters, even approximately, it is possible to separate out mid-frequency component from the overall process, which characterizes generally free motion of automatic control system, then it is possible to estimate current value of <b>control</b> <b>object</b> transmission coefficient using parameters change of this component.
