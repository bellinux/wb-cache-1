5|$|ASL {{originated}} in the early 19th century in the American School for the Deaf (ASD) in Hartford, Connecticut, from a situation of language contact. Since then, ASL use has propagated widely via schools for the deaf and Deaf community organizations. Despite its wide use, no accurate count of ASL users has been taken, though reliable estimates for American ASL users range from 250,000 to 500,000 persons, including a number of children of deaf adults. ASL users face stigma due to beliefs in the superiority of oral language to sign language, <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> ASL is often glossed in English {{due to the lack}} of a standard writing system.|$|E

WCBS announced plans to move The People's Court into the time slot that was occupied by Millionaire and the still-airing 4:30 pm local newscast once it joined the station's lineup in September 2003. This led to speculation that the syndicated Millionaire would not be returning for a second season, and BVT's concerns over losing its New York affiliate were <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> there were not many time slots available for the show in New York outside of the undesirable late-night slots that syndicators try to avoid.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{challenges}} in assessing progress {{in this area is}} the number of clinical studies that either do not report the gender of the subjects or lack the statistical power to detect gender differences.

Consequently, a number of funding agencies and scientific journals are asking researchers to explicitly address issus of sex and gender in their research.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} season, 1931–32, Arsenal {{reached the}} FA Cup final again, losing controversially to Newcastle United. Arsenal had led 1–0 with a Bob John goal, but Newcastle's equaliser {{came after a}} long ball had gone over the goal line, and out for a goal kick; Newcastle winger Jimmy Richardson nevertheless crossed the ball back into play and Jack Allen levelled the match for the Magpies; Allen scored again {{in the second half}} to win the match 2–1. Arsenal's pain was <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Everton had pipped them to the League title; a poor start to the 1931–32 campaign meant Arsenal played catch-up for most of the season, finishing two points adrift.|$|E
5|$|There {{were some}} {{significant}} {{problems with the}} casemate guns early on, however. They were equipped with hinged plates that were designed to close off the casemate opening in heavy seas. The plates were easily washed away, though, and without them, water easily entered the ship and caused significant flooding. This problem was <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> they had been mounted too low in the hull, which subjected them to heavier pounding from rough seas. The problem was eventually corrected {{by the addition of}} dwarf bulkheads in the gun houses and rubber seals to the hinged plates.|$|E
5|$|GRCs {{have been}} criticized as {{creating}} unequal voting powers between electors. At present, one vote in a GRC ward returns five or six candidates into Parliament, compared with one vote in a SMC ward, which only returns one candidate. The GRC scheme has also diluted electors' voting power. For instance, in an SMC ward there are around 14,000 voters, compared to 140,000 voters in a five- or six-member GRC. Thus, the power of each vote in a GRC is lower than in an SMC, as each voter in a GRC finds it harder to vote out an MP {{that he or she}} does not like. The situation is <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> a 30% deviation from equality of electoral divisions is tolerated. Another commentator has pointed out that the current MP-to-voter guide ratio is one MP to 26,000 voters, which implies that the number of voters in an electoral division can vary between 18,200 and 33,800. By extrapolation, a five-member GRC can have between 91,000 and 169,000 voters, a difference of 86%.|$|E

5|$|Helm {{was painted}} as a {{suspicious}} figure {{by some of}} the izinDuna because all white visitors to Bulawayo met with him before seeing the king. This feeling was <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Helm had for some time acted as Lobengula's postmaster, and so handled all mail coming into Bulawayo. He was accused of having hidden the concession's true meaning from the king and of having knowingly sabotaged the prices being paid by traders for cattle, but neither of these charges could be proven either way. On the fourth day of the enquiry, Elliot and Rees, two missionaries based at Inyati, were asked if exclusive mining rights in other countries could be bought for similar sums, as Helm was claiming; they replied in the negative. The izinDuna concluded that either Helm or the missionaries must be lying. Elliot and Rees attempted to convince Lobengula that honest men did not necessarily always hold the same opinions, but had little success.|$|E
5|$|A {{report that}} King Charles was very sick sent the Yorks back to England post-haste. They feared the King's eldest illegitimate son, James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, and {{commander}} of England's armed forces, might usurp the crown if Charles died in their absence. The matter was <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Monmouth enjoyed {{the support of}} the Exclusionists, who held a majority in the House of Commons of England. Charles survived but, feeling the Yorks returned to court too soon, sent James and Mary to Edinburgh, where they stayed on-and-off for the next three years. Lodging in Holyrood Palace, the Yorks had to make do without Ladies Anne and Isabella, who stayed in London on Charles's orders. The Yorks were recalled to London in February 1680, only to return again to Edinburgh that autumn; this time they went on a more honourable footing: James was created King's Commissioner to Scotland. Separated from Lady Isabella once again, Mary sank into a state of sadness, exacerbated by the passing of the Exclusion bill in the Commons. Lady Isabella, thus far the only one of Mary's children to survive infancy, died in February 1681. Isabella's death plunged Mary into a religious mania, worrying her physician. At the same time as news reached Holyrood of Isabella's death, Mary's mother was falsely accused of offering £10,000 for the murder of the King. The accuser, a pamphleteer, was executed by order of the King.|$|E
5|$|The bishopric of Dunblane {{was a small}} diocese, {{essentially}} {{confined to}} the earldoms of Strathearn and Menteith. Size was a problem for providing the bishopric with adequate income, a problem <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Gille Brígte, Mormaer of Strathearn, had established Inchaffray Priory in 1200 (promoted to Abbey in 1221). In the 1440s, Bower wrote that Gille Brígte: Divided his earldom into three equal portions. One he gave {{to the church and}} bishop of Dunblane, the second to St John the Evangelist and the canons of Inchaffray, the third he kept for himself and his own needs. If this were not enough, much of the income not granted to Inchaffray had since been given to other religious institutions; some revenue was even controlled by the Bishop of Dunkeld. Dunblane had its origins in an older Gaelic monastic establishment, that is, in an institution with an abbot-bishop heading a relatively informal establishment of smaller cells with little geographical compactness. Dunblane emerged as a bishopric in 1155, probably, like bishoprics with a similar history (e.g. Brechin), having changed in little more than name. There was a community of Céli Dé at Muthill until at least the end of the 13th century, and the base for the archdeaconry of the diocese appears to have varied between there and Dunblane until the time of Bishop Clement. The bishopric itself appears to have been without a single base, although it was probably associated with both locations.|$|E
50|$|The last {{section of}} I-70 to be {{completed}} was the 15-mile (24 km) Glenwood Canyon. This stretch was completed in 1992 and was an engineering marvel due to the extremely difficult terrain and narrow space in the canyon, which requires corners that are sharper than normal Interstate standards. Construction was delayed for many years due to environmental concerns. The difficulties in building the road in <b>the</b> canyon were <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>the</b> Denver & Rio Grande Western railroad occupied the south bank and many temporary construction projects took place to keep US 6 open, {{at the time the}} only east-west road in the area. Much of the highway is elevated above the Colorado River. The speed limit in this section is 50 mph (80 km/h) due to the limited sight distance and sharp corners.|$|R

The difference in outcome is partly explained by Balzac's views on heredity: Rastignac comes from a noble family, while only Rubempré's mother comes from a noble family (he had to obtain royal permission to use his mother's family name instead of his father's name Chardon). This deficit is <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> his mother had not only married a commoner far beneath her in rank, but she had also performed menial labour to support herself when her husband died.|$|E

50|$|Solutions to the {{challenges}} of water for energy and food security are hindered by shortcomings in water infrastructure, development, and management capacity {{to meet the demands of}} a rapidly growing population. This is <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>the</b> Africa has the fastest urbanization rates in the world. Water development and management are much more complex due to the multiplicity of trans-boundary water resources (rivers, lakes and aquifers). Around 75% of sub-Saharan Africa falls within 53 international river basin catchments that traverse multiple borders. This particular constraint can also be converted into an opportunity if the potential for trans-boundary cooperation is harnessed in the development of the area’s water resources. A multi-sectoral analysis of the Zambezi River, for example, shows that riparian cooperation could lead to a 23% increase in firm energy production without any additional investments. A number of institutional and legal frameworks for transboundary cooperation exist, such as the Zambezi River Authority, the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Protocol, Volta River Authority and the Nile Basin Commission. However, additional efforts are required to further develop political will, as well as the financial capacities and institutional frameworks needed for win-win multilateral cooperative actions and optimal solutions for all riparians.|$|R
25|$|There {{has been}} some {{confusion}} about the biological effects of synephrine because of the similarity of this un-prefixed name to the names m-synephrine, Meta-synephrine and Neosynephrine, all of which refer to a related drug and naturally-occurring amine more commonly known as phenylephrine. Although there are chemical and pharmacological similarities between synephrine and phenylephrine, they are nevertheless different substances.

25|$|In {{terms of}} social barriers, there is a {{significant}} gap between formal legal reforms in theory and their practice in reality. In Morocco's rural and underdeveloped areas, legal equality is perceived as less of an immediate priority than basic, everyday needs. High levels of female illiteracy and a strong sense of traditionalism in many rural areas further compound these challenges. Despite educational campaigns undertaken by various governmental and non-governmental actors (often supported by donor nations such as EU member states), levels of awareness about the reforms remain low, especially in many rural areas, where misinformation about the details of the changes has often filled the knowledge gap. Many supporters of the reforms believe that lack of awareness of the law is the primary barrier to its implementation, with a lack of legal literacy <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> many Moroccans speak a Berber dialect rather than the formal Arabic in which the law is actually written.|$|E
25|$|The 1971 Mujib regime {{pursued a}} pro-socialist agenda. In 1972, the {{government}} decided to nationalise all banks to channel {{funds to the}} public sector and to prioritise credit to those sectors that sought to reconstruct the war-torn country – mainly industry and agriculture. However, government control of the wrong sectors prevented these banks from functioning well. This was <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> loans were handed {{out to the public}} sector without commercial considerations; banks had poor capital lease, provided poor customer service and lacked all market-based monetary instruments. Because loans were given out without commercial considerations, and because they {{took a long time to}} call a non-performing loan, and once they did, recovery under the erstwhile judicial system was so expensive, loan recovery was abysmally poor. While the government made a point of intervening everywhere, it didn't set up a proper regulatory system to diagnose such problems and correct them. Hence, banking concepts like profitability and liquidity were alien to bank managers, and capital adequacy took a backseat.|$|E

50|$|The {{historical}} Cornelia remains somewhat elusive. The figure {{portrayed in}} Roman literature likely represents more what she signified to Roman writers than an objective account. This significance {{changed over time}} as Roman society evolved, in particular the role of women. The problems in interpreting <b>the</b> literature are <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> only one work allegedly attributed to Cornelia herself survives, and classicists have questioned its authenticity since the nineteenth century. The Cornelia Fragments, detailed above, purport to constitute what remains of a letter written in 124 BC to her son, Gaius, and were preserved later in the manuscripts of Cornelius Nepos, who wrote on the Gracchi. In the letter, Cornelia expresses strong opposition to Gaius’ intentions to stand for the tribunate. She also urges him not to continue the revolutionary policies of his older brother Tiberius Gracchus, which led ultimately to his death. The fragments were likely included in Nepos’ Life of Gaius Gracchus, now lost.|$|R

25|$|The Bengal {{soil profile}} {{impacted}} the famine in two ways. First, {{the soil in}} eastern Bengal, in combination with abundant irrigation from monsoon rains, was unique {{for its ability to}} grow large amounts of high quality jute. This gave Bengal an effective monopoly on a cash crop. Jute of lesser quality was grown in smaller quantities in western Bengal, but eastern Bengal was the clear-cut center of jute production. During the famine, jute-producing districts suffered higher mortality rates. Second, the sandy soil of eastern Bengal and the lighter sedimentary soil of the Sunderbans tended to drain more rapidly after the monsoon season than the laterite or heavy clay regions of western Bengal. As a rule, malaria epidemics lasted approximately one month longer in the areas with slower drainage. This problem was <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> soil exhaustion created the need for large tracts in western and central Bengal to be left fallow; eastern Bengal had far fewer fallow fields. Flooded fallow fields are one key breeding place for malaria carrying mosquitoes, which was the biggest killer during the famine.|$|E

This adequacy assessment is tenuous. The CONOPS relies heavily upon the Sikorsky MH- 60 /S as the sole platform from which the systems operate. This reliance is further <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> both AMCM systems are not simultaneously compatible on board the MH- 60 /S. As such, resource availability will challenge the MCM CONOPS as well as the other missions for which the MH- 60 /S is intended. Additionally, the AMCM CONOPS systems are dependent upon the presence of warfighters in the helicopters above the minefield and as integral participants in the efforts to identify sea mines and to assess their threat level. Model Based System Engineering (MBSE) techniques have been combined with research and stakeholder inputs in an analysis that supports these assertions. ...|$|R
