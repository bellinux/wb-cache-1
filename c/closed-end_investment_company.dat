40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the effects of Swedish and Scandinavian investor sentiment on the net asset value discounts of <b>closed-end</b> <b>investment</b> <b>companies.</b> While previous studies have linked sentiment to discounts, both Scandinavian and Swedish evidence is lacking. The study contributes to existing literature by further developing the methodology by Baker & Wurgler (2006) to examine the investor sentiment effect brought forward by Lee et al. (1991) in a Scandinavian setting. In particular, this study offers additional evidence to Hjelström (2007) regarding the aggregate discounts of <b>closed-end</b> <b>investment</b> <b>companies</b> in Swedish capital markets. Unlike previous studies, I provide evidence on individual <b>investment</b> <b>companies</b> and consider both regional and local sentiment as an explanatory factor. DATA The investor sentiment data set covers quarterly data for stock mutual fund inflows, trading volume for aggregate equity markets, and the number and first-day returns of all main-list IPOs within the time period of 1. 1. 1999 to 31. 3. 2011 separately for Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Norway. The net asset value data set covers 854 quarter-end net asset value discounts (or premiums) of 20 <b>closed-end</b> <b>investment</b> <b>companies</b> during the same time period. Both of the novel datasets were manually collected from multiple sources. RESULTS My main findings indicate that the aggregate net asset value discount of <b>closed-end</b> <b>investment</b> <b>companies</b> is not a sentiment indicator. I show that investor sentiment does not affect aggregate discounts but rather affects the discounts of individual <b>closed-end</b> <b>investment</b> <b>companies.</b> Furthermore, sentiment affects the discounts of individual <b>investment</b> <b>companies</b> in conflicting ways (i. e. positive sentiment can either increase or decrease discounts). Finally, I find evidence indicating that discounts of individual <b>investment</b> <b>companies</b> do not exhibit correlation, and that the strength of the sentiment effect varies substantially between different types of individual <b>investment</b> <b>companies.</b> My results are mostly in contrast to Lee et al. (1991) but in line with Hjelström (2007) ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{development}} of the <b>closed-end</b> <b>investment</b> trust in both the UK and the US, {{in the context of the}} investment management strategies adopted and whether they provided value-added services for investors. Although US investment trusts of the 1920 s boom years were heavily influenced by their earlier UK counterparts, they differed from British investment trusts in a number of key ways, in particular, size, capital structure, tax and accounting practices, management, and costs. These differences led to their relatively much worse performance in the stock market crash of the late 1920 s and early 1930 s. This poor US trust performance led directly to the creation of the US open-ended ‘fixed trust’, marketed as an antidote to the generally poor management of conventional <b>closed-end</b> <b>investment</b> trusts. As confidence in mutual funds slowly returned in the United States, open-ended funds were gradually given more flexibility, but US <b>investment</b> trust <b>companies,</b> with share prices at a steep discount to liquidation value, and partly blamed for the crash, were encouraged to convert to mutual fund status by the 1936 Revenue Act.

40|$|To date {{research}} has not {{resulted in a}} fully acceptable explanation of the discounts and premia {{that exist in the}} prices of <b>closed-end</b> <b>investment</b> <b>company</b> shares. Rather than being economically justified, Thompson (1978) documented that discount closed-end funds exhibit significant positive abnormal returns. Essay one reexamines the market for closed-end shares and finds that the abnormal returns persist. Further abnormal returns are concentrated in just two months, January and December. Controlling for risk and size as measured by either market price or market capitalization explains {{a large portion of the}} abnormal returns, but size fall short of a full explanation because investment strategies based upon discount weighting schemes increase abnormal returns even when controlling for size. Essay two investigates the ex-dividend day price behavior of closed-end funds. The ratio of price change to dividend amount is substantially larger than for other stocks, and the ratio is not positively correlated with dividend yield. The ratio varies by fund type. Bond funds have an average ratio slightly greater than one, while the ratio for equity funds is less than one. Closed-end funds experience significant increases in trading volume in the eleven day period surrounding the ex-day and generate large positive abnormal returns in the same period. The concentration of dividend ex-dates in December and January and abnormal returns in those same months is evidence that the abnormal returns are related to dividends in addition to discounts. Finally, discount and premium funds react differently to the announcement of a dividend. For discount funds the discount narrows, while for premium funds the premium decreases. ...|$|E
