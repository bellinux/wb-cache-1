5|$|Tracheal <b>collapse</b> {{is caused}} by a {{weakening}} of the tracheal rings in the windpipe. It occurs when the rings that normally hold the shape of the windpipe <b>collapse,</b> closing the airway. The symptoms of a <b>collapse</b> include a honking cough that can sound similar to a goose honk, an intolerance to exercise, fainting spells and a cough that is worsened by hot weather, exercise and excitement. The tendency for episodes of tracheal <b>collapse</b> typically increases in frequency and severity as the dog ages.|$|E
5|$|About fifty {{people were}} on the top wooden balcony {{at the time of}} the <b>collapse.</b> According to one witness, the sound of {{splintering}} wood was heard immediately before the <b>collapse,</b> which occurred shortly after midnight local time. The <b>collapse</b> started on the third floor, pulling down other balconies below. The first, second, and third floor balconies all collapsed into the basement below, carrying a total of approximately one hundred people among them. Several people were also trapped in a basement stairwell. Survivors helped to pull victims out from under the debris of the balconies, and rescue workers had to use chainsaws to free others. One of the survivors was a nurse, and had started a rescue effort before the emergency services arrived. The Chicago Fire Department supplied the main rescue effort. Eleven people were killed in the <b>collapse,</b> with two more subsequently dying while hospitalized; fifty-seven people were injured.|$|E

40|$|A {{framework}} for quantifying dependence between random vectors is introduced. With {{the notion of}} a <b>collapsing</b> function, random vectors are summarized by single random variables, called <b>collapsed</b> random variables in the framework. Using this framework, a general graphical assessment of independence between groups of random variables for arbitrary <b>collapsing</b> functions is provided. Measures of association computed from the <b>collapsed</b> random variables are then used to measure the dependence between random vectors. To this end, suitable <b>collapsing</b> functions are presented. Furthermore, {{the notion of a}} <b>collapsed</b> distribution function and <b>collapsed</b> copula are introduced and investigated for certain <b>collapsing</b> functions. This investigation yields a multivariate extension of the Kendall distribution and its corresponding Kendall copula for which some properties and examples are provided. In addition, non-parametric estimators for the <b>collapsed</b> measures of dependence are provided along with their corresponding asymptotic properties. Finally, data applications to bioinformatics and finance are presented...|$|R

30|$|After an earthquake, {{the walls}} and the regular {{geometric}} structure of <b>collapsed</b> buildings are damaged, and the most of the <b>collapsed</b> buildings is the ruins, so the dominant scattering mechanism <b>collapsed</b> buildings can be approximately regarded as the volume scattering from randomly oriented dipoles. Because most of the <b>collapsed</b> buildings are ruins, there is little POA shift for the <b>collapsed</b> buildings, and the implementation of POA compensation cannot greatly change the power of scattering components of the <b>collapsed</b> buildings. However, because of the POA shift of oriented buildings, the employment of POA compensation can enhance the double-bounce scattering power and weaken the volume scattering power. That is, the implementation of POA compensation can greatly change the power of scattering components of the oriented buildings. Therefore, all of the amplitude values of CRDbl, CRVol, and CRDbl–Vol of the oriented buildings are greater than those of the <b>collapsed</b> buildings. The difference of CRDbl, CRVol, and CRDbl–Vol between the <b>collapsed</b> buildings and oriented buildings can be used to distinguish them. During the three parameters of CRDbl, CRVol, and CRDbl–Vol, the difference of CRDbl–Vol between the <b>collapsed</b> buildings and oriented buildings is greatest, so CRDbl–Vol is used to discriminate the <b>collapsed</b> buildings in this paper.|$|R

This reduces the energy of the shock, which can stall the explosion within the outer core.|$|E
