Sheboygan, which was ten miles from where they had settled, was their main source of supplies. The main occupation of this area since the 1840s has been farming.

40|$|Background: Freshwater mussels remain {{among the}} most imperiled species in North America due {{primarily}} to habitat loss or degradation. Understanding how mussels respond to habitat changes can improve conservation efforts. Mussels deposit rings in their shell in which age and growth information can be read, and thus used to evaluate how mussels respond to changes in habitat. However, discrepancies between methodological approaches to obtain life history information from growth rings has led to considerable uncertainty regarding the life history characteristics of many mussel species. In this study we compared two processing methods, internal and external ring examination, to obtain age and growth information of two populations of mussels in the St. Croix River, MN, and evaluated how mussel growth responded {{to changes in the}} operation of a hydroelectric dam. Results: External ring counts consistently underestimated internal ring counts by 4 years. Despite this difference, internal and external growth patterns were consistent. In 2000, the hydroelectric dam switched from operating on a peaking schedule to run-of-the-river/partial peaking. Growth patterns between an upstream and downstream site of the dam were similar {{both before and after the}} <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>operation.</b> At the downstream site, however, older mussels had higher growth rates after the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>operation</b> than the same sized mussels collected before the change...|$|E

40|$|A {{sequencing}} {{batch reactor}} (SBR) was operated for {{enhanced biological phosphorus removal}} (EBPR) and dramatic {{differences in the}} P removing capabilities were obtained in different stages of the operation.

This latter sludge was analysed by fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) using a probe specific for Acinetobacter. Very few cells were detected with this probe indicating that Acinetobacter played an insignificant role in the P removal occurring here. Analysis of the chemical transformations of three sludges supported the biochemical pathways proposed for EBPR and non-EBPR systems in biological models.

40|$|This {{work has}} {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>operation</b> conditions {{on the performance of}} a Lithium Chloride (LiCl) wheel. A rigorous experimental rig that facilitates the measurement of temperature, pressure, pressure drop, relative humidity, airflow rate and rotational speed is used. The measurements covered balanced flow at a wide range of rotational speeds (0 - 9. 8 rpm), regeneration temperatures (50 - 70 °C), airflow rates (280 - 540 kg/h) and relative humidities (30 - 65 %) at ambient condition. The influence of those operation conditions on the wheel sensible effectiveness and coefficient of performance (COP) are analyzed. The result revealed that a maximum COP occurs at a rotational speed of 0. 2 rpm (12 rph). The results also concluded that Kays and London correlation is sufficient in the prediction of the effectiveness of the LiCl wheel.

40|$|Mobile {{networks}} in the military tactical domain, include a range of radio networks with very diverse characteristics and which may be employed differently from operation to operation. When interconnecting networks with dissimilar characteristics (e. g. capacity, range, mobility) a difficult trade-off is to fully utilize the diverse network characteristics while minimizing the cost. To support the ever increasing requirements for future operations {{it is necessary to}} provide tools to quickly alter the rule-set during an ongoing operation, due to a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>operation</b> and/or to support different needs. Our contribution is a routing protocol which targets these challenges. We propose an architecture to connect networks with different characteristics. One key point is that low capacity links/networks segments can be included in the heterogeneous network, these segments are protected from overload by controlling where and when signaling/data traffic is sent. The protocol supports traffic policing, including resource reservation. The other key point is the ability to quickly alter the network policy (rules-set) including QoS support during an operation or from operation to operation. author postprin...|$|E
