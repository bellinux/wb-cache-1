5000|$|The GS-5s are {{identical}} in appearance to the GS-4s, {{the only difference}} being the roller bearings that gave the locomotive a smoother ride and added weight. 4458 had roller bearings from the Timken Company and 4459 used SKF brand roller bearings.

40|$|Large {{geotechnical}} {{structures such as}} embankment {{dams and}} tailings dams are subject to high safety requirements. One of the key requirements is long-term stability {{in order to avoid}} incidents and failures as well as to ensure environmental safety during and after the operational phases. To ensure security, the instrumentation of existing embankment dams and tailings dams, using drilling technologies, is necessary for surveillance. Drilling in the structures of dams or in their foundations, however, always entails certain risks. Therefore, the selection of drilling technologies must be carried out carefully, taking into account the condition and sensitivity of each dam section. A continuous evaluation and development of existing drilling requirements is an important safety aspect. The main objective of this comparative study, implemented in collaboration between LKAB, Wassara AB, Sweco Infrastructure AB and Luleå University of Technology in Malmberget, Sweden, is to analyse the influence on surrounding soil of a water powered DTH hammer system and top hammer drillings with different setups during the drilling process. Covering an area of 800 m², an artificial dam with a height of 3 m was built and compacted in layers. The soil used was characterised as gravelly sand. Drillings were done vertical and inclined. Weight sounding tests before and after drilling, excavation of boreholes as well as soil sampling for further laboratory analysis have all been conducted. Complementing this research project, one vertical borehole with a depth of 30 m has been drilled with Wassara’s Lost Hammer concept (LHC) in the tailings dam of LKAB in Malmberget. This study concludes by stating that, for the analysed drilling formation, the average radius of influence on soil was identical (0. 49 m along the borehole axis) for both the water powered DTH and the hydraulic top hammer system with a pre-drilling protective <b>casing.</b> <b>Top</b> hammer drillings in combination with a casing drilling system (Symmetrix) indicate an increased average zone of influence of 0. 72 m around the boreholes. Measurements collected while drilling, correlated with laboratory analyses and weight sounding tests, reveal that the rearrangement of soil particles depends on the interaction of applied down-thrust, the vibration of the drill string, the amount of drained flushing water towards the adjacent soil and existing pressure conditions within the embankment structure.

40|$|This report {{describes}} work undertaken at Morestead, Twyford {{as part of}} a BGS {{research project}} “Nitrate Fluctuations in Groundwater”. The project uses the same site as that described in Stuart et al. (2008 a) for the project “Nitrate Mass Balance in the Saturated Zone”. A new borehole (Borehole B) was drilled in October 2008, located 10 m {{to the west of the}} existing one (Borehole A) to complement the existing infrastructure. During drilling the cuttings were inspected but no systematic recording of lithology was undertaken, as this information was already available in detail from the adjacent borehole. Borehole B was completed to a depth of 70 m and was cased to a depth of 12. 7 mbgl; remaining unsupported below this. It should be stated that the casing protruded approximately 0. 16 m above ground level. Initial geophysical characterisation was undertaken to evaluate the hole and its suitability for further testing. A multi-level sampler was installed in Borehole B during autumn 2008 when the groundwater level was low. The aim was to capture samples as the water table rose towards the anticipated spring 2009 high. The sampler worked well for most of the period, but there were issues with bottles not filling consistently, and the sampler length was insufficient to cope with rapid water level rise following heavy rainfall or snow melt. Samples retrieved were analysed for chloride, sulphate and nitrate (as NO 3), which ranged between 16. 9 and 68. 8 mg/l, 11. 7 and 29. 9 mg/l, and < 0. 6 and 60. 1 mg/l, respectively. Concentrations of nitrate appeared to increase as the water table rose above 20. 5 mbgl; below this depth there is significant noise. Concentrations of sulphate and chloride both increased as the water table rose. Gamma and resistivity logs identified marl horizons which correlated with the Borehole A core as reported in Stuart et al. (2008 a). Fluid and flow logs also indicate hydraulic layering within the Chalk. Temperature and conductivity logs suggested vertical flow below c. 25 m below <b>casing</b> <b>top,</b> which is was also supported by heat pulse flow meter (HPFM) and impeller flow logs. This flow regime was unaltered by pumping from a depth of 21. 5 m indicating reasonable permeability in the Chalk above this depth. A nitrate sonde was also run before and during pumping. The results are currently awaiting calibration and are not available at the time of reporting. Groundwater levels were monitored in Borehole A and fluctuated over a range of 13. 5 m, from around 10 to 23. 5 mbgl, between December 2006 and the beginning of March 2009. However, numerous gaps in the data remain due to water levels exceeding the range of the pressure transducer initially installed in the borehole. Water levels were notably responsive to rainfall between December and February, for example between 25 th January 2009 and 23 rd February 2009 the water table rose by 8. 7 m. The aquifer appears less responsive during summer and autumn when there is likely to be a greater soil moisture deficit...|$|E

40|$|Reservoir {{depletion}} {{will cause}} the safe equivalent circulation density (ECD) operating window of drilling fluids to narrow, or even disappear.

The results show that the degree of collapse is different for wells drilled in different types of fault regimes, and it can be controlled by optimizing the well trajectory. The collapse pressure within the shale cap was decreased due to reservoir depletion, and when a certain degree of collapse was acceptable, the collapse pressure can be even lower and a safe operating window will appear which can be beneficial to optimizing the casing program and drilling design.

40|$|This {{report is}} a master thesis {{performed}} at The Royal Institute of Technology divisions of Lightweight Structures and Naval Architecture {{in collaboration with the}} Swedish defence material administration, FMV. There are several naval submarines used by the Swedish navy and more to be built. The existing submarines have stability problems due to a high centre of gravity.

An analysis of the applied loads shows that the dimensioning loads vary between 50 and 90 kPa depending on the specified part.

30|$|The casing {{program is}} the most crucial feature that {{influences}} successful drilling operations and the longevity of the future geothermal fluid production. It implies assessing casing setting depths, a number of casing strings, nominal casing weight, casing material, type of connections and well completion. The main functions of casing programs are preventing casing deformation, supporting blow-out preventers and permanent wellhead, containing drilling and production fluids, preventing groundwater contamination, mitigating drilling fluid losses, protecting wells from corrosion, fracturing and erosion, preventing inter-zonal cross-contamination of geothermal fluids, defining a production zone and providing access to the reservoir (New Zealand Standard 2015). Conventional high-temperature (also called high-enthalpy) geothermal wells consist usually of three–four cemented casing strings. The typical casing program for most geothermal wells incorporates a conductor pipe, a surface casing, an intermediate casing which may serve as an anchor casing (i.e., casing string to which wellhead is attached), a production casing and an optional perforated liner (holed or slotted). All of these casing strings mentioned are cemented from <b>casing</b> shoe to <b>top</b> of <b>casing</b> string to prevent corrosion resulting from migration of reservoir fluids and to control thermal expansion during fluid production. A liner pipe, which is either suspended from a liner hanger or set at the well bottom, is usually left uncemented in the production section of the well. The completion is finalized by assembling a permanent wellhead {{at the top of}} the well. In most cases, it includes an expansion spool placed directly below the first master valve, which allows for expansion of the uppermost parts of the production casing string with respect to the anchor casing to which the permanent wellhead is attached.|$|R
40|$|Material fatigue is {{a failure}} mode that {{has been known to}} {{researchers}} and engineers since the 19 th century. Catastrophic accidents have happened due to fatigue failures of structures, machinery and transport vehicles. The capsizing of the semisubmersible rig Alexander L. Kielland in Norwegians waters in 1980 killed 123 people, and investigations pointed at the fatigue failure of a weld as one of the direct causes. This accident led to a number of improvements to the design of offshore structures. The noticeable safety principle ”No single accident should lead to escalating consequences” has since been adopted in a widespread manner. Since 1992 the Petroleum Safety Authority in Norway has enforced a risk based safety regime. Wells are designed to hold back reservoir pressures and avoid uncontrolled escape of hydrocarbons. In other words a well is a pressure containing vessel. Norwegian safety regulations require a dual barrier construction of wells. This safety principle ensures that one “barrier” is preventing an escalating situation should the other barrier fail. A wellhead is a heavy walled pressure vessel placed {{at the top of the}} well. The wellhead is part of the second well barrier envelope during drilling. The subsea wellheads are located at sea bottom and during subsea drilling the Blow Out Preventer (BOP) is placed on top of the subsea wellhead. The drilling riser is the connection between the BOP and the floating drilling unit. Waves and current forces acting on the drilling riser and drilling unit will cause dynamic movement. Flexible joints at top and bottom of the drilling riser protects the drilling riser from localised bending moments. The subsea wellhead is both a pressure vessel and a structurally load bearing component resisting external loads transmitted from a connected riser. These external loads can be static and cyclic combinations of bending and tension (compression). Cyclic loads will cause fatigue damage to the well. The well can take a certain amount of fatigue damage without failing. A fatigue failure of a WH system may have serious consequences. Should the WH structurally fail its pressure vessel function will be lost and for this reason WH fatigue is a potential threat to well integrity. The structural load bearing function will also be affected. Wellhead fatigue analysis can be used as a tool to estimate the accumulated fatigue damage. Analysis results then compares to a safe fatigue limit. This thesis addresses selected aspects of fatigue damage estimations of subsea wellheads and surface casings. The presented work is a contribution to the fatigue analysis methodology currently being developed within the industry. The well cement role as a boundary condition for surface casings in analytical models is particularly addressed. The majority of research focuses on the casing shoe and formation sealing, which is the primary objective of well cementing. Recent research focus on the cement limits conditions e. g. elevated temperatures. The “near-seabed” conditions of lead cements have seen less scrutiny. Some researchers have shown interest in this issue related to deep water cementing. Deep water bottom temperature is low all year round regardless of location latitude. Low sea water temperatures will depress the normal thermal gradient of the upper parts of the soil. Subsea wells are typically cemented using a lead and tail cement system, and the lead <b>top</b> <b>casing</b> cement will be pumped all the way to seabed. This lead cement will then be left curing in a low temperature environment. Hydration of cement is an exothermic chemical reaction, and the reaction rate is dependent on temperature. Laboratory measurements of low temperature early compressive strength of typical lead cement slurries are presented herein. In the North Sea the duration between placement of surface casing lead cement and installation of BOP/drilling riser will typical be around 24 hrs. Then dynamic riser loads will start acting on the upper part of a subsea well. Bending of the well causes relative motions between the conductor and surface casing. The cement around these casings will experience these relative motions. The combination of delayed cement setting due to low temperature and surface casing motions will cause localized failure of cement bonding in the upper part of the well. In subsea wellhead fatigue analysis finite element models are used. Boundary conditions in analytical models are important in ensuring similar behaviour of model and reality. One boundary condition in wellhead models is the lateral cement support of the surface casing. Modelling this cement support as infinitely stiff with a discrete vertical transition is the existing solution. In this work a modified boundary condition is presented based on low curing temperatures in combination with “premature” loading of the supporting cement. An overall analysis methodology approach has been suggested. Using a detailed local model of the well to define the lower boundary condition for the global riser load analytical model is one of its features. The implementation of a modified cement boundary condition will change the global stiffness of the local well model. The possible effect on global riser load from variations to the lower boundary condition has been studied. The conclusion supports the suggested analysis approach. Overall well ultimate structural strength will be reduced by the presence of a fatigue crack in a non pressurised load bearing part of a subsea well. An analysis methodology with case results are presented and indicate that the location of a fatigue crack affects the reduction in ultimate strength. Cases of significant reduction are expected to impact normal operating limitations. To be able to include the wellhead fatigue failure mode in an overall risk management system, the failure probability needs to be estimated. This can be done by applying a structural reliability analysis methodology to the problem. A suggested structural analysis methodology approach is suggested and notational failure probabilities are presented. Future improvements to wellhead fatigue analysis may emerge from calibrations from measurements of the reality. A comparison between analytical fatigue loading and measured fatigue loading has been presented and results indicate that the analysis results are conservative. This is evidence that analytical estimate on acceptable fatigue limits can be trusted from a safety point of view. It also indicates the monetary potential that measurements can present to the well...|$|R
