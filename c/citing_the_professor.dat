5000|$|Latter-day Saint {{critics of}} Granger’s {{exploration}} of Stephanie Meyers’ Mormonism and {{its place in}} her Twilight novels have dismissed {{his work as a}} cursory engagement with Mormonism, uncovering subtlety where none was intended, giving Meyer the benefit of doubts never demanded, and getting Mormon popular culture plain wrong. [...] Granger has been defended by BYU Professor Steven Walker, who Stephanie Meyer has <b>cited</b> as <b>the</b> <b>professor</b> who had <b>the</b> greatest influence on her. Walker, who is also a believing Mormon, has commented that Granger has persuaded him that “Meyer’s religious thought is so crucial to her fiction that to read it without consideration of the theology is to miss much of the point”, and that Granger’s work succeeds in deepening Christian’s reading of theology, showing that readers enter fully into the stories because of religious depths and heights which the Twilight novels share with the best English literature.|$|R

V. programme depicting student life at an American Law School {{in which a}} somewhat vigorous competition developed between the Law Faculty and the Engineering Faculty over {{the power of a}} computer. It began with laying odds to the effect that the computer could produce a better case analysis than a student. After several students had failed the test, <b>the</b> illustrious <b>professor</b> challenged <b>the</b> computer (together with <b>the</b> <b>professor</b> who had programmed it, it should be added!). Even <b>the</b> Law <b>professor,</b> for all his knowledge of detail and principle, was just pipped at the post in respect of most of the judgments and cases that were <b>cited.</b> However, <b>the</b> <b>professor</b> resorted to a complex problem that had been posed to him by a junior student, and which, up till that point, he had fobbed off, and posed it to the computer. As it involved grappling with notions of justice in relation to a hypothetical situation in which existing case histories did not serve adequate precedent, the giant mainframe went into overload, and had to be switched off. Thus it was that the Law Faculty was able to regain some sense of pride, and indeed to justify its very existence...|$|R

Although many of her novels have been subsequently incorporated into the canon, critics have largely ignored <b>The</b> <b>Professor’s</b> House, passing it over on account of it being “morally and psychologically unachieved”. As a reason for this disparagement, critics often <b>cite</b> <b>the</b> “broken” format of the book, rebuking its structure as unnecessary. Or, they <b>cite</b> <b>the</b> ambivalent depiction of <b>the</b> <b>Professor’s</b> psyche. <b>The</b> reader is unsure of how to consider <b>the</b> <b>Professor’s</b> demands for solitude and his entrapment in the past.

50|$|Angelus {{tells the}} team little of value but instead taunts and ridicules {{each of them}} by {{exploiting}} a weak spot either in their self-esteem or relationships. He baits Fred and Gunn by bringing up her feelings for Wesley and manages to reach through the bars and grab Fred by the throat. After Wesley saves Fred by shooting Angelus, he watches her and Gunn embrace before walking away. When Fred goes to Wesley {{to thank him for}} saving her life, the two share a passionate kiss. Gunn walks in and realizes what's happened, which results in him and Wesley coming to blows. Lilah returns and offers to free Angelus if he'll help her kill the Beast. The team stop her just in time and bring her back to the hotel along with an ancient text that details knowledge of the Beast. The gang come to realize that the Beast is not a sole agent as they presumed but is in fact working for an even greater entity. With this knowledge they decide to return Angel's soul, but find that its container, the Muo-Ping, is missing. Meanwhile, Fred and Gunn break off their relationship <b>citing</b> <b>the</b> <b>Professor's</b> murder, and Fred's feelings for Wesley, as the reason while Connor does his best to beat back the rising demonic hordes in L.A. single-handedly. Angelus eventually escapes his cage and hunts down Cordelia and Lilah in the hotel. They both make a run for it but Lilah is subsequently captured—not by Angelus but by Cordelia who then stabs her in the neck with a dagger, killing her. The gang return to find Lilah dead and Angelus feeding off her corpse. Wesley takes Lilah down to the basement to decapitate her in case she's been turned where he is met with a vision of Lilah who makes him realize what he must do and that the two perhaps did love one another. Wesley then goes to prison to free the rogue Slayer Faith in order to stop Angelus. Faith, Angelus and the Beast compete in a battle wherein Angelus slays the Beast, bringing the sun back. Meanwhile, the Beast's master, whom it turns out is Cordelia, has been communicating with Angelus to try to woo him to her side. During a battle, Angelus sucks Faith's blood but then, both he and Faith, falls into a drug induced coma through the effects of Orpheus—a mystical stimulant which Faith had injected into her blood stream. They share a mystical journey where they see Angel after he was cursed with his soul and came to America. Meanwhile, Willow Rosenberg is summoned to the hotel by Fred in order to return Angel's soul which she successfully does after competing in a magical battle with Cordelia. With all of the team's threats averted Willow takes Faith back to Sunnydale to aid in their fight against The First while Angel proclaims that they are now stronger than ever. However, Cordelia chooses that moment to come downstairs, revealing that she is pregnant with Connor's child.|$|R

5000|$|Murray Rothbard in {{his work}} For a New Liberty has claimed ancient Gaelic Ireland {{as an example of}} nearly anarcho-capitalist society. In his depiction, <b>citing</b> <b>the</b> work of <b>Professor</b> Joseph Peden, <b>the</b> basic {{political}} unit of ancient Ireland was the tuath, which is portrayed as [...] "a body of persons voluntarily united for socially beneficial purposes" [...] with its territorial claim being limited to [...] "the sum total of the landed properties of its members". Civil disputes were settled by private arbiters called [...] "brehons", and the compensation to be paid to the wronged party was insured through voluntary surety relationships. Commenting on the [...] "kings" [...] of tuaths, Rothbard states:The king was elected by the tuath from within a royal kin-group (thederbfine), which carried the hereditary priestly function. Politically, however, the king had strictly limited functions: he was the military leader of the tuath, and he presided over the tuath assemblies. But he could only conduct war or peace negotiations as agent of the assemblies; and he was in no sense sovereign and had no rights of administering justice over tuath members. He could not legislate, and when he himself was party to a lawsuit, he had to submit his case to an independent judicial arbiter.|$|R

5000|$|Having {{discussed}} the abuses {{found within the}} policies of individual countries, in chapters 7 and 8 Mosher argues {{that there are two}} distinct types of population control proponents: those who advocate it for the benefits to the funding countries, and those who support it for the supposed benefits to the recipient countries. He attempts to explain that both of these positions are based on insecurely founded. In chapter 7, Mosher confronts the claims that population control benefits the donor countries. He argues that the actual affect just the opposite for several reasons. First, reducing the population deprives the world of its most precious resource: the humanity itself. Second, population control policies exported to other countries are an attack on traditional cultures. Mosher <b>cites</b> <b>the</b> respected political commentator Dinesh D'Souza who identified the population control policies in the [...] "Cultural Left" [...] as one factor in the alienation of the [...] "traditional patriarchal family" [...] and the promotion of [...] "secular values in non-Western cultures" [...] which is partially responsible for the rise of Islamic terrorism against the West.Lastly, Mosher claims that the impetus for much of the U.S. population control policy has had the same motive: reducing the demand for immigration. Mosher argues that reducing population does not reduce immigration. He <b>cites</b> <b>the</b> Columbia University’s <b>Professor</b> Saskia Sassen in the World Policy Journal to demonstrate that [...] "there is no systematic relationship between emigration and what conventional wisdom holds to be the principal cause of emigration, ...overpopulation, poverty, and economic stagnation." [...] Mosher then argues {{that the best way to}} stop illegal immigration is not to eliminate [...] "potential immigrants before they are born, but by encouraging authentic economic development" [...] (7: 231). Mosher concludes noting that population control is sadly based in an anti-people attitude which targets those who “resemble the family planners least: the poorer, darker populations of the developing world.
