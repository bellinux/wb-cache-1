A set of <b>complete</b> <b>diallel</b> <b>crosses</b> was made using six cultivars as the parents which differed in ability of callus growth and plant regeneration. The Vr/Wr graphical analysis showed that there were epistasis, or interaction among nonallelic genes for callus growth. As to ability of plant regeneration, no epistasis existed in the subdiallel without P 1 (J 232) which showed high specific combining ability, and it was controlled by a simple additive dominance genetic system.

Crosses and checks were evaluated through a 7 x 7 triple lattice design at three locations during the 1984 / 85 season. Several agronomic traits were evaluated, but here only data on ear yield are discussed. Yield data were adjusted for stand variation (correction to 50 plants per plot) and grain moisture (15. 5 %).

The variance due to non-directional dominance was small in most environments. However, there was directional dominance in the form of inbreeding depression for both traits. It was pronounced at high yeast levels and temperatures but disappeared when yeast or temperature were decreased.

Three replicates, each consisting of two pure stocks (ZZ and MM) and two reciprocal crosses (ZM and MZ), were successfully generated. High fertilization rate and hatching level were observed among all the experimental groups, suggesting that there was no sperm-egg recognition barrier between geographic populations. Reciprocal crosses had higher survival rate compared to the pure stock crosses and the rate of survival increased with progeny growth. Growth heterosis became obvious both in larval and adult stages, and was primarily influenced by the egg origin and mating strategy at the larval stage. Also, the phenotypic traits of all progeny differed amongst the culture sites, suggesting a significant environmental effect. The Zhuhai site was more suitable for oyster aquaculture than the Maowei Sea site.

In the control, soil moisture was kept close to field capacity, with predawn leaf water potential (ΨWL) ranging from - 0. 1 to - 0. 5 MPa. In the drought regime, the soil moisture was reduced gradually by decreasing {{the amount of water}} application until ΨWL reached - 2. 0 to - 2. 5 MPa. Significant differences (p < 0. 05) were observed for most morphological attributes analyzed regarding progenies, water regime and their interactions. The results of the joint diallel analysis revealed significant effects between general combining ability (GCA) x water regimes and between specific combining ability (SCA) x water regimes. The SCA 6 genetic material showed high general combining ability for growth variables regardless of the water regime.

Data analysis using 2, 867 records collected on individually tagged fish {{after a period of}} three-months of communal rearing in an earthen pond showed that the strain from Malaysia had the fastest growth rate, whereas the lowest performing strain was that from Thailand. The growth performance of the Taiwanese strain was intermediate. In contrast to the results for body traits, survival rate was poorest for the Malaysian strain (66. 4 %). The difference in survival rate between Taiwan and Thai strains (78. 5 vs. 80. 6 %) was not statistically significant (P> 0. 05).

For the majority of the traits, GCA was more important than SCA and there was an increase of non-additive effects under low N. Significant interactions were observed between GCA and N levels for grain yield, grain number and chlorophyll content, indicating the selection of different lines for each N level.

40|$|Most of the {{available}} results on optimal block designs for diallel crosses are based on stan-dard linear model assumptions where the general combining ability effects are taken as fixed. In many practical situations, this assumption may not be tenable since often one studies only a sample of inbred lines from a possibly large (hypothetical) population. Recently Ghosh and Das (2003) proposed a random effects model and then estimated the variance components and the variances of these estimates. While comparing the yielding capacities of the cross (i, j), Kempthorne and Curnow (1961) have proposed the estimation of the yielding capacity of any cross based on the least square estimators of the general combining ability effects and/or the mean yield of the cross (i, j). In this paper, the problem of predicting the yielding capacity of the cross (i, j) from the sample of inbred lines has been considered. The properties of the best linear unbiased predictor for predicting the unobserved general combining ability effects together with general mean effect has been studied.

The crosses IT 82 D- 60 x AU 94 -MOB- 816 and IT 82 D- 60 x IT 82 D- 889 were more promising in extra-earliness flowering, while IT 82 D- 60 x IT 82 D- 889 and IT 82 D- 60 x MNC 04 - 789 B- 119 - 2 - 3 - 1 were more promising for extra-earliness maturity...|$|E
40|$|A general A- and D-efficiency {{lower bound}} has been {{obtained}} for partial <b>diallel</b> <b>cross</b> designs. These bounds {{have been used}} to show that a class of E-optimal designs, obtained by Mukerjee [1997. Optimal partial <b>diallel</b> <b>crosses.</b> Biometrika 84, 939 - 948], have high A- and D-efficiencies. Also, a class of block designs, introduced by Mukerjee [1997. Optimal partial <b>diallel</b> <b>crosses.</b> Biometrika 84, 939 - 948], is shown to be nearly E-optimal. General eigenvalues of the information matrix of these designs is obtained, which enable us to show that the block designs have high A- and D-efficiencies.

40|$|Eight winter {{rapeseed}} genotypes GA 096, Geronimo, Okapi, Orient, Sunday, Zarfam, SW 0756, and Modena {{were used}} as parents of a <b>complete</b> <b>diallel</b> mating design. A set of 56 diallel F 1 hybrids (with reciprocals) including their parents were evaluated in a 8 × 8 simple lattice design with two replications during 2007 / 08. Several agronomic traits like Plant height, number of lateral branches per pod, number of pod per main branch, number of seed per pod, 1000 seed weight, seed yield and oil content were recorded. The main objective {{was to examine the}} combining abilities of selected canola (Brassica napus L.) lines in <b>diallel</b> <b>crosses</b> and to identify candidates for promising hybrid combinations. Significant variances were observed among genotypes for all of the traits (except for seed number per plant). Significant GCA and SCA were observed for 1000 seed weight, oil content and seed yield. Reciprocal effects were significant for oil content. There were significant positive effects for yield and yield components...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY. Various {{forms of}} <b>diallel</b> <b>crosses</b> play an {{important}} role in evaluating the breeding potential of genetic material in plant and animal breeding. In this paper we consider partial <b>diallel</b> <b>crosses</b> in incomplete block or completely randomized designs. Optimal designs in both the unblocked and blocked situations are characterized. Two methods of construction of MS-optimal designs are proposed leading to design families which have very high A- and D-efficiencies. 1...|$|R
