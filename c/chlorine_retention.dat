40|$|During {{pneumonia}} the metabolism of {{inorganic substances}} deviates markedly from the normal. While chlorine, sodium, and calcium are {{retained in the}} body, potassium and magnesium are excreted normally or in excess. Two cases showed a definite loss of magnesium to {{the body in the}} febrile period. During the period of retention the chlorine content of the blood is distinctly lower than normally, the calcium content is apparently slightly lower, and the magnesium content tends also to be a little lower. The skin is shown, to play no special part in the <b>chlorine</b> <b>retention.</b> Since no organ or organs have been shown to store up large amounts of the retained substances, it is probable that they are spread diffusely throughout the body...|$|E
40|$|Polyethylene {{films were}} surface modified, to {{incorporate}} amine and amide functionalities, and subsequently were evaluated {{for their ability}} to recharge the antimicrobial N-halamine structures after contact with sodium hypochlorite, a common food-approved sanitizer. Surfaces were tested for <b>chlorine</b> <b>retention</b> and release, as well as antimicrobial activity against microorganisms relevant to food quality and food safety, including Escherichia coli K- 12, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Bacillus cereus, and Listeria monocytogenes. N-Halamine functionalized polyethylene exhibited chlorine rechargeability, maintaining 5 to 7 nmol/cm 2 N-halamine structures for six successive charges. The N-halamine functionalized films achieved a 4 -log reduction for all organisms tested and maintained a greater than 3 -log reduction for four successive uses, suggesting that the modified polyethylene films are capable of providing rechargeable antimicrobial activity. The modified films exhibited antimicrobial activity in aqueous suspensions (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) and reduced microbial growth in diluted broth (P 3 ̆c 0. 05), suggesting the potential for biocidal action even in the presence of organic matter. Such a rechargeable antimicrobial surface could supplement existing cleaning and sanitation programs in food processing environments to reduce the adhesion, growth, and subsequent cross-contamination of food pathogens, as well as food spoilage organisms...|$|E
40|$|Consideration {{of natural}} {{formation}} of organochlorine compounds in soils {{is necessary in}} radioecology {{in order to understand}} chlorine radioisotope (36 Cl) cycling in various environments for safety assessment purposes, but also in ecotoxicology because certain chlorinated organics in soils are toxic compounds. On the other hand, occurrence of organic chlorine in soils is poorly documented, especially in non-forest ecosystems. We measured total and organic chlorine concentrations in 51 French surface soils sampled from grassland, arable and forest sites on a national scale (French soil quality monitoring network) in order to characterize the variability of organic chlorine concentrations for these different land uses. While previous studies reported that the chlorination of soil organic matter is responsible for <b>chlorine</b> <b>retention</b> in temperate forest ecosystems, this study shows that the non-extractable organohalogen pool accounts for the majority (> 80 % on an average) of the total measurable chlorine in grassland and agricultural soils. This suggests that natural chlorination is a widespread phenomenon in all kinds of soils. A multiple linear regression analysis performed on the dataset indicated that retention of organochlorine in soils is related to the organic carbon content, Cl input and soil pH...|$|E

Three agriculture biomass fuels and olive cake {{were used in the}} experiments. Polish lignites and bituminous coals were examined as anti-sintering additives. The effects of <b>chlorine</b> release, potassium <b>retention</b> and ash sintering were examined by heating samples of biomass fuels and additives in the muffle oven and, next, firing them in the laboratory down-fired furnace at the temperature in the range of 800 - 1150 ºC. The obtained slag samples were analysed on: chlorine and potassium content, sintering tendency and crystalline components. Among the examined coals lignite from Turów mine and bituminous coal from Bolesław Śmiały mine appeared to be the most effective in potassium retention in aluminosilicate and chlorine release from slag. Possibly the major factor of these coals which reduced ash sintering was relatively high content of kaolinit...|$|R
40|$|Lab-scale {{investigations}} {{have been conducted}} {{on the impact of}} additives on the abatement of chlorine corrosion induced by combustion or co-firing of agricultural biofuels in boilers. The effect of potassium <b>retention</b> and <b>chlorine</b> liberation was examined applying domestic aluminosilicates. The following additives were examined: kaolin, bentonite, halloysite and lignite fly ash. The samples of potassium chloride and the additive mixtures were heated in the muffle furnace at the temperature range 600 – 1000 ºC. The obtained sintered samples were examined on: <b>chlorine</b> content, potassium <b>retention</b> and crystalline structure. Three minerals additives (kaolin, bentonite and halloysite) appeared to be effective in potassium binding in high temperature melting potassium aluminosilicates and in liberating chlorine at the temperature range 800 – 1000 ºC. Also the aluminosilicate type lignite fly ash can be considered as very effective and inexpensive additive that prevents chlorine corrosion during biomass co-firing...|$|R
40|$|Microbes {{have been}} {{suggested}} {{to have a strong}} impact on the transportation of chlorine in soils. There are speculations about environmental factors limiting microbial effect on <b>chlorine</b> movement and <b>retention.</b> For this study, a numerical hydrochemical model was built to describe microbial transformation of chlorine in a laboratory lysimeter experiment. Undisturbed soil cores used to set-up the experiment were collected from a coniferous forest soil in southeast Sweden. The lysimeters were modelled in groups depending on their different water and chloride treatments. Microbial transformation of chlorine was better described under high water residence times and high chloride loads compared to low water residence times and low chloride loads. Microbial activity was also shown to properly account for a sudden shift from net-chlorine <b>retention</b> to net <b>chlorine</b> release in most of the lysimeters. Oxygen proved to be very important in accounting for the short-term shift from chloride retention to release in all the lysimeters. Model outcome revealed that 0. 02 – 0. 10 mg Cl- could be available per day in a coniferous soil depending on season and other soil conditions. This study shows that modeling enable a better understanding of chlorine biogeochemistry. It also confirms the speculated importance of microbial activities on chloride availability in soils...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{gas phase}} {{hydrogenation}} of 3 -butyne- 2 -one, an alkynic ketone, over two alumina-supported palladium catalysts is investigated using infrared spectroscopy in a batch reactor at 373 K. The mean particle {{size of the}} palladium crystallites of the two catalysts are comparable (2. 4 ± 0. 1 nm). One catalyst (Pd(NO 3) 2 /Al 2 O 3) is prepared from a palladium(II) nitrate precursor, whereas the other catalyst (PdCl 2 /Al 2 O 3) is prepared using palladium(II) chloride as the Pd precursor compound. A three-stage sequential process is observed with the Pd(NO 3) 2 /Al 2 O 3 catalyst facilitating complete reduction {{all the way through}} to 2 -butanol. However, hydrogenation stops at 2 -butanone with the PdCl 2 /Al 2 O 3 catalyst. The inability of the PdCl 2 /Al 2 O 3 catalyst to reduce 2 -butanone is attributed to the inaccessibility of edge sites on this catalyst, which are blocked by <b>chlorine</b> <b>retention</b> originating from the catalyst’s preparative process. The reaction profiles observed for the hydrogenation of this alkynic ketone are consistent with the site-selective chemistry recently reported for the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, an alkenic aldehyde, over the same two catalysts. Thus, it is suggested that a previously postulated structure/activity relationship may be generic for the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds over supported Pd catalysts...|$|E
40|$|Uranium oxide {{catalysts}} supported upon gamma-Al 2 O 3 and amorphous and {{mesoporous silica}} {{have been tested}} for CO/O- 2 and NO/CO conversions. Pre-calcination is deleterious to catalysts on a mesoporous support due to extrusion of the active uranium phase into poorly dispersed uranium oxide particles. Developing the catalysts under CO/O- 2 /He or CO/NO/He avoids extrusion and results in superior mesoporous catalysts (from uranyl nitrate precursor) which are comparable to Pt/Al 2 O 3 catalysts. Chloride is found generally to be deleterious to catalyst performance. The exception to this in UCl 4 /gamma-Al 2 O 3 calcined at 873 K for CO/O- 2. In this system, the total activity is correlated {{to the level of}} <b>chlorine</b> <b>retention</b> and average uranium phase crystallite size within the catalyst. The net rate expression for selective reduction of NO by CO over the best mesoporous catalyst is zero order in NO and proportional to [CO](1, 4) in contrast to bulk U 3 O 8 where the net rate depends upon [NO]. The activation energy (E(,)) and pre-exponential factors (v) are highly correlated both to each other and the net dispersion of the UO 2. 2 phase recovered after catalysis; the most active systems are highly dispersed where the E(,) values are more than compensated for by higher values of v...|$|E

40|$|Sludge from {{wastewater}} treatment plants in five Swedish pulp and paper mills has been burned together with wood in a circulating fluidised bed (CFB) boiler. The sludge was either mechanically dewatered or pre-dried. The mechanically dewatered sludge had to be fed with a pump, but the pre-dried sludge could be fed by the fuel feed system normally used for coal, wood chips or wood pellets. In parallel to the combustion tests in the CFB boiler the sludges were also investigated as single fuels in a small laboratory FB. The Swedish {{pulp and paper industry}} produces three major fractions of sludge: pure fibre sludge, sludge produced by employing a precipitation species like ironaluminiumsulphate, and finally, sludge subjected to biological cleaning. The way of production of the sludge influences its content of, for example, nitrogen, sulphur and chlorine, but the composition of the sludge is also influenced by the pulp and paper process. The present measurements show that the concentrations of nitrogen, sulphur and chlorine in the sludge have a great impact on the corresponding gaseous emissions from combustion. Actions to prevent these emissions could be necessary, depending on the origin of the sludge and treatment process used. In the present project all sludges were burned with wood-pellets as the main fuel under identical operating conditions, typical for a CFB boiler. Wood pellets were chosen as a well defined, low-polluting fuel that makes comparison of emissions from the sludges clear. Co-combustion with wood-pellets has the advantage of enabling operation also with wet sludges that cannot be used as single fuels without pre-drying. No actions were taken to improve sulphur and <b>chlorine</b> <b>retention,</b> by for example adding limestone. From a combustion point of view the co-combustion works well with low levels of carbon monoxide present in the flue gas and no light hydrocarbons...|$|E
40|$|The silver-ion catalyzed {{solvolysis}} of 2 -chloro- 2 -azabicyclo [2. 2. 1] hept- 5 -ene and 2 -chloro- 2 -azabicyclo [2. 2. 2] oct- 5 -ene was investigated. These compounds {{were found}} to solvolyse with assistance from the olefinic double bond, rearranging to 1 -azabicyclic systems. In the former case, further reaction to tricyclic structures was observed. Comparison of these results with those for the solvolysis of 2 -chloro- 2 -azabicyclo [2. 2. l] heptane and 2 -chloro- 2 -azabicyclo [2. 2. 2] octane showed a close parallel; the heptane/heptane systems were observed to retain chlorine in their initial solvolysis products, while the octane/octane homologues did not. The reasons for <b>chlorine</b> <b>retention</b> are discussed, and the phenomenon {{is related to the}} structure of the original N-chloroamine. Alumina was found to be an effective catalyst for the rearrangement of 2 -chloro- 2 -azabicyclo [2. 2. l] hept- 5 -ene and 2 -chloro- 2 -azabicyclo [2. 2. l] heptane, superior in most respects to silverion. A novel reaction of certain of these chloramines (thermolytic conversion to the corresponding amine hydrochlorides) is also reported. Factors affecting the ratio of invertomers in strained 2 -azabicyclic and 7 -azabicyclic chloramines were also studied. In the 2 -azabicyclic systems, the invertomer ratio appeared to depend largely on the relative severity of the steric interactions in the two invertomers. In 7 -Chloro- 7 -azabenzonorbomadienes and 7 -chloro- 7 -azabenzonorbomenes, however, electronic influences on the ratio of invertomers were demonstrated by variation of the substituents on the benzene ring, thus altering the character of the aromatic p orbital without affecting molecular stereochemistry. It was concluded that the varying character of the aromatic orbital affected the invertomer ratios by a mechanism essentially electrostatic in nature...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of AgronomyGanga M. HettiarachchiConstructed wetland {{treatment}} systems (CWTSs) are {{an alternative}} adaptation for flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) wastewater purification. A series of laboratory-based soil column studies mimicking a pilot-scale CWTS {{was carried out}} to evaluate {{the performance of the}} treatment system in detail. The main objectives of studies were to (1) understand the transport characteristics, retention capacity and transformation of selenium and other FGD constituents in the CWTS, (2) evaluate the effectiveness of soil treatments and influent flow rate on the performance of the CWTS, and (3) develop a mechanistic understanding of the CWTS performance through monitoring interrelationships of selenium (Se), arsenic (As), iron (Fe), and sulfur (S). Ferrihydrite (1 % w/w), and labile organic carbon (OC) were used as soil treatments. Different influent flow rates, X (1. 42 mL/hour), 2 X, or 1 / 2 X were used depending on the objectives of each study. Deoxygenated 1 : 1 mixture of FGD: raw water was the influent. It was delivered to the saturated columns with an upward flow. Effluent samples were collected continuously, and analyzed for constituents of concern. End of these experiments, soil from sectioned columns were used for total elemental analysis, sequential extraction procedure (SEP) for Se, and synchrotron-based X-ray spectroscopy analyses. Results indicated a complete Se retention by the columns. Boron, and fluorine partially retained whereas sodium, sulfur, and <b>chlorine</b> <b>retention</b> was weak, agreeing with field observations. Some of the initially-retained Se (~ 4 to 5 %) was mobilized by changing redox conditions in the soil. Selenium fed with the wastewater accumulated in the bottom 1 / 3 (inlet) of the soil columns and was mainly sequestrated as stable forms revealed by SEP. Bulk-, and micro-XANES analyses suggested the retention mechanism of Se from the FGD wastewater was via the transformation of Se into reduced/stable forms [Se(IV), organic Se, and Se(0) ]. Under wetland conditions, native soil As was mobilized by reductive dissolution of As associated minerals. However, the ferrihydrite amendment suppressed the native soil As mobility. Micro-XRF mapping integrated with As, and Fe-XANES suggested that the mechanism of native soil As retention was the sequestration of released As with newly precipitated secondary Fe minerals. A long-term study carried out with X, 1 / 2 X flow rates, and OC source indicated enhanced S retention by the slow flow rate (1 / 2 X), most likely due to the time dependency of biogenic S reduction. Further, bulk S-, As-, and Fe-XANES revealed that long submergence period and the slow flow rate increased the formation of reduced and/or biogenic S, realgar-like, and greigite-like species. These observations indicated that modified flow rates could {{have a significant impact on}} the long-term trace element (such as As) sequestration in the CWTS. Our studies provide useful information to improve the performance, and longevity of a full-scale CWTS for FGD wastewaters...|$|E
