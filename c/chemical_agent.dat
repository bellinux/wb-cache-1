5|$|Liz {{is worried}} when she smells maple syrup in her {{apartment}} and Jack tells her {{that it could be}} the <b>chemical</b> <b>agent</b> Northrax. She suspects that her new neighbour, Raheem (Fred Armisen), is a terrorist because he has maps in his apartment and she has seen him and his brother, Hakeem (Hamza Ahmed), on an agility course in the park. Liz is shocked to discover that the pair are auditioning for The Amazing Race and, in fact, not terrorists.|$|E
5|$|They trace Hoffman to his home, {{finding his}} {{equipment}} {{used to create}} the <b>chemical</b> <b>agent</b> downstairs but no sign of Hoffman. Walter nearly suffocates from an agent left by Hoffman, but Olivia and Peter are able to save him in time. As the FBI search the premises, they find evidence that points to a convention being held to promote world equality. Olivia and Peter depart {{to try to find}} Hoffman, while Walter remains behind, examining Hoffman's equipment.|$|E
5|$|At the convention, Hoffman has {{replaced}} the heating elements for the chafing-dishes with his own. Olivia and Peter struggle with locating Hoffman before Walter and Astrid (Jasika Nicole) arrive. Walter uses a fogger to distribute his own <b>chemical</b> <b>agent,</b> this time specific to Hoffman, and soon the man is found dying. As the team regroups, Walter fully admits to killing Hoffman, a crime in itself, but Broyles (Lance Reddick) decides to let Walter go. Later, Peter {{has been able to}} recover the rest of his grandfather's work and returns it to Walter; Walter then goes through the files, finding an old photo of his father and Hoffman working together.|$|E

5|$|On 21 August 2013, rockets {{containing}} the <b>chemical</b> <b>agent</b> sarin struck several opposition-controlled or disputed {{areas of the}} Ghouta suburbs of Damascus, resulting {{in the death of}} more than 300 people and injury to thousands in the Ghouta chemical attack. The United States and other Western countries blamed the Syrian government for the attacks, while Syria blamed civil war opposition forces. In response to Ghouta, a coalition of countries led by the United States and France, which support the rebels, threatened air strikes on Syria. Russia, a key ally of Syria, along with China had earlier blocked efforts by the United States, France, and the UK to secure United Nations Security Council approval for military intervention. The United States and France headed a coalition of countries on the verge of carrying out air strikes on Syria.|$|E

Most CAIS were destroyed in the 1980s but the U.S. Army Chemical Materials Agency still occasionally demilitarizes CAIS that are found buried.|$|E
25|$|All FRCs carry a large {{array of}} {{equipment}} to allow officers to conduct normal policing duties and basic investigative work which officers {{are expected to}} perform {{with the implementation of}} the Neighbourhood Police Centre (NPC) system. A typical FRC vehicle may therefore stock equipment for the force-opening of locked doors, conducting roadblocks, fingerprint collection, and the provision of first aid.

40|$|Despite {{the general}} {{consensus}} that synaesthesia emerges at an early developmental stage and is only rarely acquired during adulthood, the transient induction of synaesthesia with <b>chemical</b> <b>agents</b> has been frequently reported in research on different psychoactive substances. Nevertheless, these effects remain poorly understood and have not been systematically incorporated. Here we review the known published studies in which <b>chemical</b> <b>agents</b> were observed to elicit synaesthesia. Across studies there is consistent evidence that serotonin agonists elicit transient experiences of synaesthesia. Despite convergent results across studies, studies investigating the induction of synaesthesia with <b>chemical</b> <b>agents</b> have numerous methodological limitations and little experimental research has been conducted. Cumulatively, these studies implicate the serotonergic system in synaesthesia and have implications for the neurochemical mechanisms underlying this phenomenon but methodological limitations in this research area preclude making firm conclusions regarding whether <b>chemical</b> <b>agents</b> can induce genuine synaesthesia...|$|R
25|$|Two {{large-scale}} hostage takings, the 2002 Moscow theater {{hostage crisis}} and the 2004 Beslan school siege, resulted {{in the deaths of}} multiple civilians. In the Moscow stand-off, FSB Spetsnaz forces stormed the building on the third day using an unknown incapacitating <b>chemical</b> <b>agent</b> that proved to be lethal without sufficient medical care, resulting in deaths of 133 out of 916 hostages. In Beslan, some 20 hostages had been executed by their captors before the assault, and the ill-prepared assault itself (started hastily after explosions in the gym that had been rigged with explosives by the terrorists) resulted in 294 more casualties among the 1128 hostages, as well as heavy losses among the special forces.|$|E
25|$|The Porton Down {{analysis}} by James R. Riches and his colleagues, , showed that while fentanyl or 3-methyl fentanyl were {{absent from the}} urine of one survivor and residues of the agent in the clothing of two other British survivors, the veterinary large animal sedative drug carfentanil and anesthetic agent remifentanil were identified by liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometry in one hostage's urine and on the clothing of three hostages who had returned to Britain after the hostage rescue. The authors concluded that carfentanil and remifentanil were used as a mixture in the <b>chemical</b> <b>agent</b> employed by Russian troops to subdue the Chechen terrorists and hostages at the Barricade Theater, perhaps suspended in the anesthetic agent halothane.|$|E
25|$|Demilitarization {{operations}} at Rocky Mountain Arsenal left exactly 888 Weteye bombs intact and in storage in Colorado. In 1981 the U.S. Department of Defense sought to relocate the {{weapons to the}} Tooele <b>Chemical</b> <b>Agent</b> Disposal Facility at the Deseret Chemical Depot. This move was opposed by many residents of Utah and the state's governor at the time Scott M. Matheson. The transfer was controversial and Matheson continued to fight it until the U.S. Senate passed a bill which included an amendment sponsored by then-U.S. Senator Gary Hart (D-CO) requiring the weapons be moved out of Colorado. Matheson's concern stemmed {{from the fact that}} some of the thin-shelled Weteyes stored in Colorado were leaking nerve agent.|$|E

25|$|Anniston {{is home to}} the Anniston Army Depot {{which is}} used for the {{maintenance}} of most Army tracked vehicles. The depot also housed a major chemical weapons storage facility, the Anniston Chemical Activity, and a program to destroy those weapons, the Anniston <b>Chemical</b> <b>Agent</b> Disposal Facility. In 2003, the Anniston Army Depot began the process of destroying the chemical weapons it had stored at the depot and at Fort McClellan. An incinerator was built to destroy the stockpile of Sarin, VX nerve agent, and mustard blister agent stored at the depot. Destruction of the weapons was completed in 2011. The incinerator and related operations were officially closed in May 2013, and the incinerator was disassembled and removed from the depot at the end of 2013.|$|E
25|$|Sodium {{bicarbonate}} {{can be used}} {{to extinguish}} small grease or electrical fires by being thrown over the fire, as heating of sodium bicarbonate releases carbon dioxide. However, it should not be applied to fires in deep fryers; the sudden release of gas may cause the grease to splatter. Sodium bicarbonate is used in BC dry chemical fire extinguishers {{as an alternative to the}} more corrosive diammonium phosphate in ABC extinguishers. The alkaline nature of sodium bicarbonate makes it the only dry <b>chemical</b> <b>agent,</b> besides Purple-K, that was used in large-scale fire suppression systems installed in commercial kitchens. Because it can act as an alkali, the agent has a mild saponification effect on hot grease, which forms a smothering, soapy foam.|$|E
