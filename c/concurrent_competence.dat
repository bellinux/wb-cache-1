40|$|The {{judicial}} {{enforcement of}} the right to health in Brazil raises advances and challenges for public policies. This article analyzes two judicial decisions from the 4 th Region’s Federal Court in 2014 admitting the concurrent and solidary responsibility of federative entities in the supply of medicines. In both decisions, the appeal was allowed and the idea that federative entities have <b>concurrent</b> <b>competence</b> and solidarity in health was reinforced. On the one hand, a common example of interaction between the law and the health is observed in these decisions; on the other, a production of tensions and contradictions is identified. At first glance, the recognition of the solidary responsibility of federative entities may seem strongly positive from the user’s perspective, and this will lead to having more users going to courts to claim their right to health. However, from a management perspective, it brings challenges as there will be overpayment of some entities of the federation at the expense of others. In this sense, and based on cases, the main rules of competence currently used in health public policies will be presented. Major advances, limits and challenges of recognizing the solidary responsibility of federative entities as well as some “side effects” that some court decisions may bring will also be discussed...|$|E
40|$|Tourism is {{gradually}} recognized and acknowledged {{as an important}} sector to drive economic growth across many nations. It is by {{no coincidence that the}} South African government took a bold decision to elevate the importance of tourism in the economy through the establishment of a dedicated tourism ministry in 2009. Tourism derives its mandate from the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa 108 of 1996, which outlines tourism function as an area of <b>concurrent</b> <b>competence</b> between the three spheres of government that is national, provincial and local government. According to Tsatsire (2008 : 1), the new mandate given to local government post 1994 implies that local government is no longer expected to render basic services only, but is also required to serve as an agent of development. The main objective of the study is to identify the challenges faced by the municipalities in the implementation of tourism functions, using UMgungundlovu District Municipality as a case study and pursued the following specific objectives: To establish the roles and responsibilities of municipalities in tourism; To assess whether these responsibilities are adequately performed and to understand the reasons for deficiencies, if there are any; To highlight the contribution of tourism to local economic development; To ascertain the status of the implementation of the tourism strategy for the UMgungundlovu District Municipality (UMDM); To highlight the significance of the role of municipalities in achieving national and provincial tourism objectives and; To recommend appropriate actions to overcome the challenges pertaining to implementation of tourism at a local government level. The study is premised upon the acknowledgement that there are many developmental challenges facing municipalities and tourism is one of them. With tourism being recognised more and more as an essential component of local economic development, municipalities are required to {{play a central role in}} ensuring the implementation of national and provincial priorities to boost the sector’s contribution to the economy. The study explores various pieces of legislation upon which tourism mandate on local government is embedded. This has enabled to provide clarification with regards to the roles and responsibilities of local government in tourism. The connection between tourism and local economic development is succinctly discussed to ascertain the benefits of tourism and its contribution in local economy. The study took a form of qualitative research and therefore employing the use of qualitative research techniques in terms of data collection, analysis and interpretation process. Data were collected through the review and analysis of strategy documents including the Local Economic Development Strategy, Tourism Strategy and the Integrated Development Plan of UMgungundlovu District Municipality. Interviews were also conducted with the officials responsible for tourism within UMDM and other local tourism stakeholder organization within the study area including uMsunduzi Pietermaritzburg Tourism Association, Howick uMngeni Community Tourism Association, Pietermaritzburg Business Chamber of Commerce, KwaZulu Natal Department of Economic Development and Tourism and Tourism KwaZulu Natal. The methodology that was followed in the study has enabled the researcher to address all the study objectives and to compile the findings report presented in chapter four. Tourism is one of the functions of local government; however, municipalities are faced with a variety of challenges in the implementation of tourism function. Challenges that are pertinent to UMDM are discussed and articulated in this report. The study concludes by documenting the recommendations conferred by the respondents with the objective to overcome the challenges pertaining to implementation of tourism at a local government level. These recommendations are further discussed to explore practical actions on how the UMDM can overcome the identified challenges to enhance local economic development through tourism...|$|E
40|$|In federal {{states with}} territorially based ethnic, {{linguistic}} or religious cleavages, {{the allocation of}} competences among the levels of government may be determined by highly salient normative convictions and conflicts. In their absence, the economic theory of federalism and the subsidiarity principle might offer some highly abstract guidelines. Of greater practical significance are country-specific points of departure, path-dependent institutional developments and concrete challenges that might provoke a change of direction. Germany, for instance, is a polity with a unitary political culture but also with institutionally entrenched sub-national governments. Thus the post-war decades saw a continuous expansion of federal legislative competences combined with a continuous increase of practices of 'cooperative federalism' and 'joint decision-making'. As a result of high consensus requirements, both the federation and the Lnder lost the capacity for autonomous political action. When, under the pressures of German unification, Europeanisation and economic globalisation, the demands for decisive policy changes were often frustrated, the blame was directed at federal institutions. Hence the reform of German federalism, the 'first phase' of which began in 2003 and was completed in 2006, sought to increase the capacity for autonomous political action by replacing joint decision-making with the allocation of exclusive competence to both the federation and the Lnder. It can be seen already, however, that the reforms that were in fact adopted fall {{far short of the}} original goals. I will discuss the reasons for this relative failure and will outline a more promising approach to the management of <b>concurrent</b> <b>competences</b> that might also be useful elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|The EU {{competition}} law reforms of 2004 decentralised enforcement from the European Commission to national competition authorities and national courts, while the European Commission remains {{central to the}} system. This thesis responds to a need for research into how institutions interact in this system of <b>concurrent</b> <b>competences</b> to effectively enforce the EU competition rules. It explores the constitutional consequences of the methods for ensuring coherent interpretation and effective application of the EU competition rules, through case studies on the interaction between courts and administrative authorities and between the supranational and national levels. With {{a focus on the}} role of courts, the thesis draws on the EU principle of institutional balance and the concept of interpretative pluralism. It finds that while apparently empowering (national) courts, the post‐ 2004 regime still limits the ambit of judicial competence in favour of administrative bodies. The European Commission can influence interpretation of the competition rules in national court proceedings {{as well as in the}} European Competition Network of competition authorities, in which the Court of Justice of the European Union has in effect handed over responsibility. In an extension of national courts’ obligation not to rule counter to a European Commission decision, forthcoming legislation proposes they should be bound by national competition authority decisions. The thesis argues that there should be more emphasis on horizontal relationships between courts, led by judges themselves. This would not only lend itself to coherent – and effective – application of {{competition law}}, but would allow courts to push back against the apparent dominance of administrative authorities in this area...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has focused on understanding the relationship between predictors of peer victimization, such as internalizing and externalizing tendencies, social competence and negative parenting behaviors. The present study attempted to identify longitudinal and concurrent associations between these variables and peer victimization in middle childhood. It also examined variables of earlier and concurrent self-control, disorganized attachment and parent boundary violations, which previous studies have not looked at. The study was conducted using data collected from a subsample drawn from the Minnesota Longitudinal Study of Risk and Adaptation. Results show that earlier negative parenting behaviors, externalizing tendencies, social problems and low self-control positively correlated with later peer victimization, and that ego control significantly correlated with concurrent peer victimization. Attachment in infancy, earlier internalizing behaviors and earlier and <b>concurrent</b> social <b>competence</b> were not associated with peer victimization. Implications of our findings and suggestions for future research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{examine the}} {{reliability}} and validity of the 42 -item Brief Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (BITSEA), a screener for social-emotional/behavioral problems and delays in competence. Method Parents in a representative healthy birth cohort of 1, 237 infants aged 12 to 36 months completed the Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) /BITSEA, the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) / 1. 5 - 5, the MacArthur Communication Developmental Inventory vocabulary checklist, and worry questions. In a subsample, independent evaluators rated infant-toddler behavior. Results Test-retest reliability was excellent and interrater agreement (mother/father and parent/child-care provider) was good. Supporting validity, BITSEA problems correlated with concurrent evaluator problem ratings and CBCL/ 1. 5 - 5 scores and also predicted CBCL/ 1. 5 - 5 and ITSEA problem scores one year later. BITSEA measures of <b>competence</b> correlated with <b>concurrent</b> observed <b>competence</b> and predicted later ITSEA competence measures. Supporting discriminant validity, only 23 % of high BITSEA problem scorers had delayed vocabulary. Moreover, the combined BITSEA problem/ competence cutpoints identified 85 % of subclinical/clinical CBCL/ 1. 5 - 5 scores, while maintaining acceptable specificity (75 %). Conclusions Findings support the BITSEA a...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} on the sources of cognitive competence in infancy and early childhood has highlighted the role of social and emotional factors (for example, Lewis, 1993 b). Exploring the roots of competence requires a longitudinal and multivariate approach. To deal with the resulting complexity, potentially integrative theoretical constructs are required. One logical candidate is self-regulation. Three key developmental questions were {{the focus of this}} investigation. 1) Does infant self-regulation (attentional, emotional, and social) predict preschool cognitive competence? 2) Does infant self-regulation predict preschool self-regulation? 3) Does preschool self-regulation predict <b>concurrent</b> preschool cognitive <b>competence?</b> One hundred preschoolers (46 females, 54 males; mean age = 5 years, 11 months) who had participated at 9 - and/ or 12 -months of age in an object permanence task were recruited to participate in this longitudinal investigation. Each subject completed four scales of the WPPSI-R and two social cognitive tasks. Parents completed questionnaires about their preschoolers' regulatory behaviours (Achenbach's Child Behavior Checklist [1991] and selected items from Eisenberg et ale [1993] and Derryberry & Rothbart [1988]). Separate behavioural coding systems were developed to capture regulatory capabilities in infancy (from the object permanence task) and preschool (from the WPPSIR Block Design). Overall, correlational and multiple regression results offered strong affirmative answers to the three key questions (R's =. 30 to. 38), using the behavioural observations of self-regulation. Behavioural regulation at preschool substantially predicted parental reports of regulation, but the latter variables did not predict preschool competence. Infant selfregulation and preschool regulation made statistically independent contributions to competence, even though regulation at Time 1 and Time 2 ii were substantially related. The results are interpreted as supporting a developmental pathway in which well-regulated infants more readily acquire both expertise and more sophisticated regulatory skills. Future research should address the origins of these skills earlier in infancy, and the social contexts that generate them and support them during the intervening years...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this chapter is to examine three inter-connected themes which have emerged in the evolutionary development of the Union as an international actor. The first theme relates {{to the relationship between}} internal and external powers and policies. The degree to which the Union’s external powers reflect or mirror internal competence is not only a question of their extent; it extends to the objectives and content of the policies pursued by the Union internally and externally; the nature or fundamental legal characteristics of the external dimension to the Union legal order. To what extent are external powers an extension of internal powers and objectives? The expansion of the scope and extent of the Union’s external powers (whether express or implied) has of course reflected not only the expansion of areas of activity internally but also the changing preoccupations of the Union, in particular as regards its place in the world. It is also true that external commitments and activity are having an increasing impact on the development of internal policies. As always within the Community and Union systems, issues of competence are intimately connected with both the inter-institutional and the institution–Member State balance of power. The second theme of this chapter traces how the classic approach to pre-emption, whereby the occupation of a field of legislative activity by the Community legal order excludes <b>concurrent</b> Member State <b>competence,</b> has given way to a wide acceptance of shared powers in external and internal spheres of competence, as well as the legal principles and structural solutions by which shared competence is managed. The emergent international identity of the Union and the factors that shape it form the third theme. A number of factors are at play here, including constitutional constraints on Union competence, the essential autonomy of the Union legal order within the wider context of international law and legal relations, the raised profile (and raised expectations) of the Union especially through the development of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the complexity of relations between the ‘Pillars’ between 1993 and 2009 and the legacy of the Pillars present in the Union’s constitutional structure following the Treaty of Lisbon. The evolution of the Union as an effective international actor will depend on the emergence of sufficiently flexible and robust internal constitutional structures. Amid the angst over policy fragmentation, the failure of the Constitutional Treaty, and the lack of institutional cohesion, it is possible to see a process of integration in the formation of an international identity for the Union. The terms ‘integration’ and ‘identity’ are not, however, intended to imply a monolithic structure. Highly diverse patterns of decision-making, different power-structures between the actors involved (Member States, Commission, Council, European Council, European Parliament), the wide variety of (formal and informal, binding and non-binding) instruments used, the connections between external policies and between internal and external aspects of policies, are all elements of a complex multi-dimensional construction. The complexity and diversity are necessary but need to operate within a framework which manages to be both flexible and coherent, and this chapter will end by assessing some {{of the ways in which}} the most recent Treaty reform process responds to this need...|$|R
