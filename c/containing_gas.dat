25|$|Breathing gas {{at depth}} from {{underwater}} breathing apparatus {{results in the}} lungs <b>containing</b> <b>gas</b> at a higher pressure than atmospheric pressure. So a free-diver can dive to 10 metres (33feet) and safely ascend without exhaling, because the gas in the lungs had been inhaled at atmospheric pressure, whereas a diver who inhales at 10 metres and ascends without exhaling has lungs containing twice the amount of gas at atmospheric pressure and is very likely to suffer life-threatening lung damage.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{chemical}} reactions have {{water as a}} product. If the reactions take place at temperatures higher than the dew point of the surrounding air the water will be formed as vapor and increase the local humidity, if below the dew point local condensation will occur. Typical reactions that result in water formation are the burning of hydrogen or hydrocarbons in air or other oxygen <b>containing</b> <b>gas</b> mixtures, or {{as a result of}} reactions with oxidizers.|$|E
50|$|A stage {{cylinder}} <b>contains</b> <b>gas</b> {{intended to}} extend bottom time.

25|$|The new law {{returned}} {{legal ownership}} {{to the state}} of all hydrocarbons and natural resources, maintained royalties at 18 percent, but increased taxes from 16 to 32 percent. It gave the government control of the commercialization of the resources and allowed for continuous government control with annual audits. It also ordered companies to consult with indigenous groups who live on land <b>containing</b> <b>gas</b> deposits. The law stated that the 76 contracts signed by foreign firms must be renegotiated before 180 days. This has not yet been done. Protesters argued that the new law did not go far enough to protect the natural resources from exploitation by foreign corporations, demanding a complete nationalization of the gas and process in Bolivia.|$|E
500|$|Divers who breathe from an {{underwater}} apparatus are supplied with breathing gas at ambient pressure, {{which results in}} their lungs <b>containing</b> <b>gas</b> at higher than atmospheric pressure. Divers breathing compressed air (such as when scuba diving) may suffer a pneumothorax {{as a result of}} barotrauma from ascending just [...] while breath-holding with their lungs fully inflated. An additional problem in these cases is that those with other features of decompression sickness are typically treated in a diving chamber with hyperbaric therapy; this can lead to a small pneumothorax rapidly enlarging and causing features of tension.|$|E
500|$|Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness, like {{previous}} Tomb Raider games, is a third-person action-adventure puzzle game. Players {{control the}} main series protagonist Lara Croft through {{the majority of}} the game. The majority of Lara's basic moves are carried over from the previous instalment, such as walking, jumping, climbing, swinging on ropes and standard gunplay. Her new moves include a small hop, army-crawling, hand-to-hand combat and a [...] "super-jump" [...] that can be performed while running. Lara can also sneak up on enemies and perform stealth attacks, flatten herself against walls and peer around corners. Lara's ability to sprint, present in the three previous entries in the series, is only available when the player opens a cabinet <b>containing</b> <b>gas</b> masks in the 'Galleries Under Siege' level. Her weapons arsenal is also modified from previous games, featuring new weapons such as a K2 Impactor stun gun and upgraded versions of weapons like the shotgun.|$|E

It {{is not possible to}} regenerate a poisoned catalyst that has been deactivated by sulfur, by treating with either oxygen or hydrogen. If sulfur <b>containing</b> <b>gases</b> are present in the sample, a switching valve should be used either to bypass the catalyst, or to back-flush the column to vent after elution of CO2.|$|R

50|$|It {{functions}} {{by having}} two parallel tubes both <b>containing</b> <b>gas</b> and heating coils. The gases are examined {{by comparing the}} rate of loss of heat from the heating coils into the gas. The coils are arranged in a bridge circuit so that resistance changes due to unequal cooling can be measured. One channel normally holds a reference gas and the mixture to be tested is passed through the other channel.|$|E

50|$|Volume {{viscosity}} (also called second viscosity or {{bulk viscosity}} or dilatational viscosity) becomes important only for such effects where fluid compressibility is essential. Dilatational viscosity {{is a measure}} of the viscous forces and viscous forces depend on the rate of compression or dilatation. Dilatational viscosity is zero for monatomic gases at low density. For an incompressible liquid the dilatational viscosity is neglected. The dilatational viscosity is important in describing sound absorption in polyatomic gases and in describing the fluid dynamics of liquids <b>containing</b> <b>gas</b> bubbles.|$|E
