2500|$|Three dhole-like {{animals are}} {{featured}} on the <b>coping</b> <b>stone</b> of the Bharhut stupa dating from 100 BC. They are shown waiting by a tree, with a woman or spirit trapped up it, a scene reminiscent of dholes treeing tigers. The animal's fearsome reputation in India is reflected {{by the number of}} pejorative names it possesses in Hindi, which variously translate as [...] "red devil", [...] "devil dog", [...] "jungle devil", or [...] "hound of Kali". According to zoologist and explorer Leopold von Schrenck, he had trouble obtaining dhole specimens during his exploration of Amurland, as the local Gilyaks greatly feared the species. This fear and superstition was not however shared by neighbouring Tungusic peoples. Von Schrenk speculated that this differing attitude towards dholes was due to the Tungusic people's more nomadic, hunter-gatherer lifestyle. Dhole-like animals are described in numerous old European texts, including the Ostrogoth sagas, where they are portrayed as hell hounds. The demon dogs accompanying Hellequin in Mediaeval French passion plays, as well as the ones inhabiting the legendary forest of Brocéliande, have been attributed to dholes. According to Charles Hamilton Smith, the dangerous wild canids mentioned by Scaliger as having lived in the forests of Montefalcone could have been based on dholes, as they were described as unlike wolves in habits, voice and appearance. The Montefalcone family's coat of arms had a pair of red dogs as supporters.|$|E

I will leave this bag here, so as to know exactly where you have gone in and--as the rope is plenty long enough--you keep hold of it here, at sixty yards from the dummy; and I will fasten the slack end to the stone so that, when I go in, I have only to hold the rope in my hand, {{to be able to}} join you. I will take this heavy <b>coping</b> <b>stone</b> in my hand; will crawl along on this {{shelving}} bank, till I arrive at the dummy; and will then throw the stone in, and run back at full speed, and be in the water a few seconds after you are." ...|$|E

50|$|The final {{layer on}} the top of the wall also {{consists}} of large <b>stones,</b> called capstones, <b>coping</b> <b>stones</b> or <b>copes.</b> As with the tie stones, the capstones span the entire width of the wall and prevent it breaking apart. In some areas, such as South Wales, there is a tradition of placing the <b>coping</b> <b>stones</b> on a final layer of flat stones slightly wider than the top of the wall proper (coverbands).|$|R
60|$|Blinking old {{men who are}} let out of workhouses by the hour, have a {{tendency}} to sit on bits of <b>coping</b> <b>stone</b> in these churchyards, leaning with both hands on their sticks and asthmatically gasping. The more depressed class of beggars too, bring hither broken meats, and munch. I am on nodding terms with a meditative turncock who lingers in one of them, and whom I suspect of a turn for poetry; the rather, as he looks out of temper when he gives the fire-plug a disparaging wrench with that large tuning-fork of his which would wear out the shoulder of his coat, but for a precautionary piece of inlaid leather. Fire-ladders, which I am satisfied nobody knows anything about, and the keys of which were lost in ancient times, moulder away in the larger churchyards, under eaves like wooden eyebrows; and so removed are those corners from the haunts of men and boys, that once on a fifth of November I found a 'Guy' trusted to take care of himself there, while his proprietors had gone to dinner. Of the expression of his face I cannot report, because it was turned to the wall; but his shrugged shoulders and his ten extended fingers, appeared to denote that he had moralised in his little straw chair on the mystery of mortality until he gave it up as a bad job.|$|E
6000|$|Kaa {{had only}} just worked his way over the west wall, landing with a wrench that {{dislodged}} a <b>coping</b> <b>stone</b> into the ditch. He {{had no intention of}} losing any advantage of the ground, and coiled and uncoiled himself once or twice, to be sure that every foot of his long body was in working order. All that while the fight with Baloo went on, and the monkeys yelled in the tank round Bagheera, and Mang the Bat, flying to and fro, carried the news of the great battle over the jungle, till even Hathi the Wild Elephant trumpeted, and, far away, scattered bands of the Monkey-Folk woke and came leaping along the tree-roads to help their comrades in the Cold Lairs, and the noise of the fight roused all the day birds for miles round. Then Kaa came straight, quickly, and anxious to kill. The fighting strength of a python is in the driving blow of his head backed by all the strength and weight of his body. If you can imagine a lance, or a battering ram, or a hammer weighing nearly half a ton driven by a cool, quiet mind living in the handle of it, you can roughly imagine what Kaa was like when he fought. A python four or five feet long can knock a man down if he hits him fairly in the chest, and Kaa was thirty feet long, as you know. His first stroke was delivered {{into the heart of the}} crowd round Baloo. It was sent home with shut mouth in silence, and there was no need of a second. The monkeys scattered with cries of--"Kaa! It is Kaa! Run! Run!" ...|$|E

50|$|The main {{construction}} {{phases of}} Amaravati fall in two main periods, with the additions consisting of railings (vedikā) and carved slabs placed against the stūpa proper. These slabs are usually called 'drum slabs' {{because they were}} placed round {{the base of the}} stūpa which has a shape similar to a circular drum. In the early period (circa 200-100 BCE), the stūpa had a simple railing consisting of granite pillars, with plain cross-bars, and <b>coping</b> <b>stones.</b> The <b>coping</b> <b>stones</b> with youths and animal reliefs, the early drum slabs, and some other early fragments belong to this period. The stūpa must have been fairly large at this time, considering the size of the granite pillars (some of which are still seen in situ, following excavations).|$|R
50|$|The present {{gravity dam}} was {{constructed}} in 1906 and was officially opened by the first Mayor of Loughborough Joseph Griggs.

The building was designed by the architect H. M. Wakeley in a mixed Baroque and Art Nouveau style; Sarah Bernhardt laid the foundation stone for the building in 1904 and Sir Henry Irving laid the <b>coping</b> <b>stone</b> in 1905. Clarkson's was there from 1905 to 1940.|$|E

50|$|The Corbridge Lion, Northumberland, England, is {{an ancient}} Roman {{free-standing}} sandstone sculpture of a male lion standing on a prone animal (possibly a deer) on a semi-cylindrical <b>coping</b> <b>stone</b> base. Measuring 0.95m in length by 0.36m in width and 0.87m high, it was originally a piece of decorative funerary ornamentation from a tomb (symbolising the conquest of Death over Life). It was subsequently re-used as a fountainhead by passing a water pipe through its mouth. It {{was found in a}} water tank in 1907 in excavations led by Leonard Woolley on Site II (a corridor building with tesselated floors, hypocausts, and painted wallplaster that has been suggested as a mansio or posting station) on the Roman site at Corbridge. It is believed to date to the 2nd or 3rd centuries AD.|$|E
50|$|A {{lewis is}} most useful {{when it is}} not {{possible}} to lift the stone with chains or slings, because of either the location or shape of the stone, or delicate projections. Examples include the closing stone in a string course, cylindrical column drums, decorated column capitals, and <b>coping</b> <b>stones</b> in a pediment. Heavy ashlar stones are also bedded using a lewis.|$|R

50|$|Once Morton {{had passed}} his higher {{language}} examination in Arabic he received accelerated promotion under Spicer's patronage, reaching the (sergeant-major equivalent) rank of Head Constable {{at the beginning}} of the 1936-1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, only his steel helmet prevented a <b>coping</b> <b>stone</b> from smashing his skull during one riot in Haifa. In 1936 he was awarded the British Empire Medal, he married in 1939. By April 1938 he was an Assistant Superintendent in charge of the Jenin Division. Jenin was the hotbed of rural Palestinian resistance to British rule, along with Nablus and Tulkarm, and Bernard Montgomery praised Morton for discharging his duties effectively while showing a particular talent for rooting out arms caches, sometimes by an imaginative use of ruses which belied his rather solemn demeanor. He was noted for his coolness under fire in several skirmishes although he downplayed this by saying that Arabs were bad shots.|$|E
