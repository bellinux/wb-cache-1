40|$|Currently {{there is}} an active Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) {{solutions}} search, which attempts to find cryptographic protocols resistant to attacks by means of for instance Shor polynomial time algorithm for numerical field problems like integer factorization (IFP) or the discrete logarithm (DLP). The use of non-commutative or non-associative structures are, among others, valid choices {{for these kinds of}} protocols. In our case, we focus on a permutation subgroup of high order and belonging to the symmetric group S 381. Using adequate one-way functions (OWF), we derived a Diffie-Hellman key exchange and an ElGamal <b>ciphering</b> <b>procedure</b> that only relies on combinatorial operations. Both OWF pose hard search problems which are assumed as not belonging to BQP time-complexity class. Obvious advantages of present protocols are their conceptual simplicity, fast throughput implementations, high cryptanalytic security and no need for arithmetic operations and therefore extended precision libraries. Such features make them suitable for low performance and low power consumption platforms like smart cards, USB-keys and cellphones. Comment: 9 pages, 13 figure...|$|E

The compromise of the security of a cipher usually resulted from exceeding the days safety margin for transmission, thus creating Depth or by other breaches of standard operating instructions.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Cryptography is {{the study}} of {{mathematical}} techniques related to aspects of information security such as confidentiality, data integrity, entity authentication and data origin authentication. In data and telecommunications, cryptography is necessary when communicating over any unreliable medium, which includes any network particularly the internet. In this paper, a 128 bit AES encryption and Decryption by using Rijndael algorithm (Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm) is been made into a synthesizable using Verilog code which can be easily implemented on to FPGA. The algorithm is composed of three main parts: cipher, inverse cipher and Key Expansion. Cipher converts data to an unintelligible form called plaintext. Key Expansion generates a Key schedule that is used in cipher and inverse <b>cipher</b> <b>procedure.</b> <b>Cipher</b> and inverse cipher are composed of special number of rounds. For the AES algorithm, the number of rounds to be performed during the execution of the algorithm uses a round function that is composed o...|$|R

The cipher is constructed as a cascade clock control sequence generator, {{which is based}} on the notion of jump registers. We present an attack which exploits the <b>cipher’s</b> initialisation <b>procedure</b> to recover the 128 -bit secret key. The attack requires around 265 computations. An improved version of the attack is also presented, with complexity of the order of 252 operation...|$|R
40|$|The logic ruling {{the user}} and network {{authentication}} {{as well as}} the data ciphering in the GSM architecture is characterized, regarding the transferring of the parameters employed in these processes, by transactions between three nodes of the system, that is the MS, actually the SIM, the visited MSC/VLR, and the AuC, which is attached to the HLR in most cases. The GPRS and the UMTS architecture carry the heritage of the GSM's philosophy regarding the user/network authentication and the data ciphering. So, the corresponding three nodes (MS, VLR, and HLR) of these systems are involved as well in the authentication and data <b>ciphering</b> <b>procedures.</b> Moreover, the methods of the conventional cryptography have been adopted by all three systems. This paper describes in brief the subscriber authentication and data ciphering, as they are recommended by the Specifications for all three aforementioned systems. Based on what the specifications define, we pinpoint the vulnerable points of the systems, exposed to third party attacks, and propose asymmetric cryptography procedures for their coverage, consisting of the introduction of public-private key pairs for the transactions between the VLR-HLR, {{as well as the}} MS-VLR. On the other hand, the nature of the services constituting a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) renders the telecommunication operators the main candidates for the development of PKIs fully or partially fledged. The private-public key pair, stored by the PLMN operator in the SIM, for the GSM/GPRS case, or in the USIM for the UMTS case and created to deal initially with internal system functions, can easily be extended, adopted and employed in secure e/m-transactions, if bound to a digital certificate, in the case the PLMN operator supports PKI services as well...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:-Thispaper {{introduces}} modified cryptographic technique, {{which uses}} two keys for encryption and same two keys {{are used for}} Decryption. This technique is generated by an intermediate cipher followed by genetic function singlepoint crossover to produce final cipher. This paper uses 5 x 5 squarematrix and the input data stream is put into the square matrix. Sum of the left diagonal positional values will be key 1 and with that key 1 intermediate cipher text will be produced. Key 1 is variable and its value depends on the plain text. Single point crossover, is applied on the binary field of intermediate cipher text. Thefivedigit randomnumber will generate as key 2, and this key 2 is randomly generated, and fixed by the user before doing the crossover. According to the digits of key 2 block division process and crossover point is finalized to produce final <b>cipher.</b> Reverse <b>procedure</b> with the same key...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims at {{developing}} a new hybrid cipher by combining the characteristics of 3 ciphers namely AES (Advanced Encryption Standard),Rc 4 (also known as ARC 4) and Serpent. The characteristics of both the ciphers are studied and a new cipher combining the characteristics of both the ciphers is generated which is more secure than the original ciphers. AES, SERPENT characteristics are its security and its resistance against attacks and the major characteristic of Rc 4 is its speed. Therefore these characteristics are imbibed in the newly generated cipher. Thus it proves to be faster than the original AES and secure against most attacks. Three combination techniques have been formulated to generate a hybridized <b>cipher</b> and the <b>procedure</b> along with {{the strengths and weaknesses}} outlined. The third cipher is the major cipher which is focused on in this paper. It is also shown that this cipher is resistant against most attacks. This will ensure the secrecy and confidentially of the messages it is used to encrypt...|$|R
