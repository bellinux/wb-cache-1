5|$|With {{the growing}} Caribbean {{following}} in England, the West Indies entered the series {{as one of}} the most popular touring nations. Lance Gibbs' 11 wickets at Old Trafford set up a commanding 10 wicket win for the West Indies. The second match at Lord's was chiefly remembered for its dramatic ending; all results were possible going into the final over of the match. England required eight runs to win but only had two wickets left. From the fourth ball of the over Derek Shackleton was run out, which meant that Colin Cowdrey had to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> broken arm with two balls of the match remaining. He did not have to face a ball, and the match ended in a draw. The third Test saw Fred Trueman claim 12 wickets ensuring England won by 217 runs. Charlie Griffith's 6/36 in the fourth and Conrad Hunte's 108 in the final Test meant the West Indies won the next two Tests and the series finished 3–1. The final Test saw a pitch invasion when Basil Butcher scored the winning runs for the West Indies.|$|E

Dallas would <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dominant Game 3 performance at home after inserting Jason Terry into the starting lineup, but New Orleans would win the final 2 games of the series, keyed by David West in Game 4 and Paul's triple-double in Game 5.|$|E
25|$|By the mid 19th century, {{the wine}} {{industry}} of France enjoyed a golden period of prosperity. A {{new class of}} consumers, the bourgeoisie, emerged as a strong market for wine and other culinary products. The Gironde region of Bordeaux, in particular, enjoyed a swell of interest from both the Parisian market {{as well as its}} steady trade with England. For the 1855 Paris Exposition, Emperor Napoleon III commissioned the Bordeaux merchants to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> ranking of the region's wine estates. The 1855 classification of Bordeaux would become one of the world's most famous rankings of wine estates. Wine was becoming a cornerstone of the French economy and a source of national pride as French wine enjoyed international recognition as the benchmark standards for the wine world.|$|E

500|$|Karthik Pasupulate of The Times of India {{gave the}} film 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, [...] "You cannot {{appreciate}} the smarts {{in the script}} has been written, and how humorously it all gets translated onscreen without getting unduly melodramatic. Since this is ANR's last film, the cumulative nostalgia and feel goodness of the movie might just paper over the structural issues. It's definitely worth a watch". Suresh Kavirayani of Deccan Chronicle also gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, [...] "Vikram Kumar has <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> nice story and screenplay and created a classic masterpiece. Though there are past life regressions and rebirths, the director’s intelligent screenplay makes you to see more comfortably without any confusion. Manam is a good film to watch and a fitting tribute to Akkineni Nageswara Rao." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of GoldenEye in {{reviving}} the Bond series, there was pressure to recreate that success in the film's follow-up production. This pressure came from MGM along with its new owner, billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, both of whom wished for the film's release to coincide with their public stock offering. Co-producer Michael G. Wilson also expressed concern regarding the public's expectations subsequent to {{the success of}} GoldenEye, commenting: [...] "You realize that there's a huge audience and I guess you don't want to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> film that's going to somehow disappoint them." [...] This was the first Bond film to be made after the death of Albert R. Broccoli, who had previously been involved with the series' production since its beginning. The rush to complete the film drove the budget to $110 million. The producers were unable to persuade Martin Campbell, the director of GoldenEye, to return; his agent said that [...] "Martin just didn't want to do two Bond films in a row." [...] Instead, Roger Spottiswoode was chosen in September 1996. Spottiswoode said he had previously offered to direct a Bond film while Timothy Dalton was still in the leading role.|$|E

500|$|A neo {{soul and}} R album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill {{incorporates}} musical styles such as soul, hip hop, and reggae. Some songs {{are based in}} hip hop soul. [...] "When It Hurts So Bad" [...] is musically old roots reggae mixed with soul. While mostly in English, [...] "Forgive Them Father" [...] and [...] "Lost Ones" [...] both feature singing in patois, which is the common dialect in Jamaica. Although heavily R, the song [...] "Superstar" [...] contains an interpolation of the rock song [...] "Light My Fire" [...] by The Doors. Hill said that she [...] "didn't want to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> [...] type of sound", but create [...] "something that was uniquely and very clearly a Lauryn Hill album." [...] She also said {{that she did not}} intend for the album's sound to be commercially appealing: [...] "There's too much pressure to have hits these days. Artists are watching Billboard instead of exploring themselves. Look at someone like Aretha, she didn't hit with her first album, but she was able to grow up and find herself. I wanted to make honest music. I don't like things to be too perfect, or too polished. People may criticize me for that, but I grew up listening to Al Green and Sam Cooke. When they hit a high note, you actually felt it." ...|$|E
500|$|On Senior Day at Penn State, {{the final}} home {{game of the}} season, the 6–4 Lions were set to host the 7–3 Nebraska Cornhuskers, however despite the Huskers having the better record, the opening line gave Penn State a {{two-point}} advantage. Earlier in the week, it was announced that, {{in addition to the}} 14 seniors, Penn State would honor defensive tackle Kyle Baublitz, offensive tackle Garry Gilliam, and wide receiver Alex Kenney on the field prior to the game; none of the three planned to return for the 2014 season despite each having an additional year of eligibility. [...] Offensively for Penn State, Biletnikoff Award semifinalist wide receiver Allen Robinson entered the game by far Penn State's biggest threat in the passing game, with three times more receptions (81) entering the game than Penn State's second receiver, Brandon Felder (27). Perhaps the biggest opportunity for Penn State's offense to achieve success against Nebraska's defense, however, was through the running game, either on the coattails of Bill Belton or Zach Zwinak; Nebraska's run defense had frequently been [...] "gouged" [...] against Big Ten offenses. Similarly, Nebraska's offense would have an opportunity to continue to achieve success through its running game, led by Ameer Abdullah, who entered the game averaging 6.5 yards per carry. [...] He had picked up the slack in the absence of their prior starter at quarterback Taylor Martinez, sidelined due to injury. Penn State coach Bill O'Brien predicted that whichever team committed fewer turnovers would win, as both teams had previously experienced problems with turnovers, both entering the game with negative turnover margins. Both teams entered the game with freshmen quarterbacks, in Christian Hackenberg for Penn State, and Tommy Armstrong for Nebraska, but both teams' primary playmakers came from outside the quarterback position, with Robinson for Penn State, and Abdullah for Nebraska. According to York Daily Record writer Frank Bodani, Penn State's offense was more consistent than Nebraska's, who committed too many turnovers, giving Penn State the edge. Defensively, Penn State was hit-or-miss in their secondary as well as in stopping the run, so Nebraska, who was also inconsistent, held a slight edge with their playmakers Randy Gregory and Ciante Evans, Nebraska also held an edge on special teams due to consistency and depth, but Penn State had superior coaching as well as intangibles, with a [...] "roaring crowd" [...] on Senior Day. With two hit-or-miss squads, most writers thought this would be a relatively close game, though a plurality leaned towards Nebraska edging out a victory, however some thought that Penn State's seniors would <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> vengeance, never having defeated Nebraska since they joined the Big Ten, and the [...] "resilient" [...] group would use that motivation to eke out a victory in their final game at Beaver Stadium.|$|E

2500|$|Krugman {{has also}} been {{critical}} {{of some of the}} Obama administration's economic policies. He has criticized the Obama stimulus plan as being too small and inadequate given the size of the economy and the banking rescue plan as misdirected; Krugman wrote in The New York Times: [...] "an overwhelming majority [...] believes that the government is spending too much to help large financial institutions. This suggests that the administration's money-for-nothing financial policy will eventually deplete its political capital." [...] In particular, he considered the Obama administration's actions to prop up the US financial system in 2009 to be impractical and unduly favorable to Wall Street bankers. In anticipation of President Obama's Job Summit in December 2009, Krugman said in a Fresh Dialogues interview, [...] "This jobs summit can't be an empty exercise...he can't <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> proposal for $10 or $20Billion of stuff because people will view that as a joke. There has to be a significant job proposal...I have in mind something like $300Billion." ...|$|E

These incidents, {{along with many other}} perfidious actions of the Japanese {{throughout}} the Pacific War, led to an American tendency to shoot the dead or wounded Japanese soldiers and those who were attempting to surrender and not take them as prisoners of war easily. Two Marines of Iwo Jima told cautionary tales. One confided: [...] "They always told you take prisoners but we had some bad experiences on Saipan taking prisoners, you take them and then as soon as they get behind the lines they drop grenades and you lose a few more people. You get a little bit leery of taking prisoners when they are fighting to the death and so are you." [...] The other reported, [...] "Very few of them came out on their own; when they did, why, usually one in the front he'd come out with his hands up and one behind him, he'd <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> grenade." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{shut-down}} of the Army facility {{proved the}} last straw for Truman. [...] On the evening of July 23, Truman ordered the steelmakers and the union {{to meet in the}} White House the following day and settle the strike. At 10:00a.m. on July 24, Murray and Fairless were ushered into the Oval Office. Truman informed the two men of top-secret statistics which showed the U.S. war effort in Korea was being crippled. The President then told Fairless: [...] "You can settle this thing, Ben, and you've got to settle it. I want it settled by tomorrow morning, or I will have some things to say that you won't like to hear, and I will have to do some things you won't like." [...] Fairless started in surprise. Truman then turned to Murray and said, [...] "Phil, you've got to settle this thing too. Now go in there in the Cabinet room, and I want you to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> settlement." [...] The two men adjourned to the Cabinet Room.

2500|$|One sketch {{featured}} {{an employee}} (McCulloch) at a counter who loans a customer (McDonald) his ballpoint. After conducting his business, the customer absentmindedly pockets {{the pen and}} walks off. The employee sets off in a mad pursuit, all the while screaming [...] "MY PEN!" [...] The employee chases the customer outside, {{in time to see}} him climbing into a taxi. He has horrific fantasies of the customer sticking the pen into his ear, using it to stab a bystander, and reinserting the bloody pen into his own ear. The employee chases the taxi down the street and, leaping through the air, lands on the vehicle, holding onto the passenger side door with his finger tips. After a drive around town, the taxi pulls over, the customer issues a cursory apology before returning the pen, after which the employee curls up with it in the street, and some of his co-workers <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> comfort blanket to collect him. The sketch ends with another customer asking for the pen, only for the audience to see that the employee now wears a large, weighty helmet with a chinstrap and a chain attached at the forehead, the other end of which secures the pen. [...] This short film, as well as many other The Kids in the Hall shorts, was directed by Michael Kennedy.|$|E
