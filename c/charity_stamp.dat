50|$|In October 1940, Italy {{launched}} {{an invasion of}} Greece from Albania. A Greek counter-attack succeeded in occupying much of southern Albania, including Epirus. During this period of Greek control, which lasted until the German invasion of April 1941, the overprint ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΗ ΔΙΟΙΚΗΣΙΣ (Hellenic Administration) in black or carmine was applied to Greek definitive issues, airmail stamps, postage due <b>stamps</b> and <b>charity</b> <b>stamps.</b> The overprinted issues were withdrawn from sale in June 1941.|$|R
5000|$|The 1931 {{issue is}} perhaps the most famous of the early health stamps. As a depression-era measure, postage rates for private mail had {{increased}} to two pennies (this was reversed in 1932), and so a second stamp was needed. As the 1929 Finance Act had explicitly stated the value of <b>charity</b> <b>stamps,</b> an amendment to the act was required to permit the second stamp. This was provided by section 11 of the Finance (No. 4) Act of 1931, which deleted the explicit values, and allowed the Postmaster-General to issue the stamps “in such denominations as he thinks fit.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Semi-postal {{issues are}} not always issued {{on a regular basis}} for health and similar causes; they have been on {{occasion}} issued as a means of raising funds for disaster relief. These are usually sold as <b>charity</b> <b>stamps,</b> though occasionally, as with the 1971 refugee relief stamps of India, the excess cost has been levied as an obligatory tax. One of the highest value semi-postal stamps is the Falkland islands' [...] "rebuilding fund" [...] stamp, issued in 1982 after the Anglo-Argentinian war over the islands. This was aimed primarily at collectors, and had a postal value of £1 with an added £1 surcharge.|$|R

50|$|Two later Belgian {{treatments}} are notable for being set in rural locations and compassionate {{treatment of the}} subject. Eugene Laermans varies the scene by picturing the pair side by side as they cross a stone bridge, the blind man with a cane in his right hand, the lame with a crutch in his left and his own right hand hooked through the other’s arm. The Symbolist Anto Carte's painting of 1926-1930 places the pair in a Brabant landscape with the recognisable spire of the church at Ohain downslope. It was this scene which was subsequently reused on a 1954 set of Belgian <b>charity</b> <b>stamps.</b>|$|R

50|$|A semi-postal stamp or semipostal stamp, {{also known}} as a <b>charity</b> <b>stamp,</b> is a postage stamp issued to raise money for a {{particular}} purpose (such as a charitable cause) and sold at a premium over the postal value. Typically the stamp shows two denominations separated by a plus sign, but in many cases the only denomination shown is for the postage rate, and the postal customer simply pays the higher price when purchasing the stamps.|$|E
50|$|They were {{introduced}} to the United States by Emily Bissell in 1907, after she had read about the 1904 Danish Christmas seal in an article by Danish-born Jacob Riis, a muckraking journalist and photographer. Bissell hoped to raise money for a sanitarium on the Brandywine Creek in Delaware. Bissell went on to design a Delaware local Christmas seal in 1908. Local Christmas seals have existed alongside national issues in the US since 1907, and are catalogued by the Christmas Seal & <b>Charity</b> <b>Stamp</b> Society.|$|E

50|$|Semi-postals became {{widespread}} in European countries {{at the beginning}} of the 20th century. In many cases they have become standard annual issues, such as the Pro Juventute series of Switzerland started in 1913. Many countries issued semi-postal stamps to raise money for the Red Cross in World War I. The surcharges are typically a fraction of the face value; at one point the Fédération Internationale de Philatélie was officially boycotting stamps with surcharges greater than 50 per cent of face value, saying that such issues were exploitive of stamp collectors. The United Kingdom's Royal Mail, a relative newcomer to semi-postals, issued its first stamp of this type in 1975 with a 4½p denomination and a premium of 1½p for charitable causes making the total cost 6p, with funds going to health and handicap <b>charities.</b> The <b>stamp</b> issue was not considered a success and there have been few UK semi-postal issues since.|$|R
