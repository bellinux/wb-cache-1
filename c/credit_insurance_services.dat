40|$|Despite {{significant}} progress {{in the development of}} quantitative geography techniques and methods and a general recognition of the need {{to improve the quality of}} geographic data, few studies have exploited the potential of geospatial tools to augment the quality of available data methods in developing countries. This paper uses data from an extensive deployment of geospatial technology in India to compare crop areas estimated using geospatial technology to crop areas estimated by conventional methods and assess the differences between the methods. The results presented here show that crop area estimates based on geospatial technology generally exceed the estimates obtained using conventional methods. This suggests that conventional methods are unable to respond quickly to changes in cropping patterns and therefore do not accurately record the area under high-value cash crops. This finding has wider implications for commercializing agriculture and the delivery of farm <b>credit</b> and <b>insurance</b> <b>services</b> in developing countries. Significant data errors found in the conventional methods could affect critical policy interventions such as planning for food security. Some research and policy implications are discussed...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in combined micro-finance schemes delivering both micro-insurance and micro-credit products {{to provide a more}} comprehensive response to existing market failures often leading to a lack of access to financial services for excluded populations. Despite its increasingly widespread practice, the issue of combined micro-finance has received relatively little attention and various specific research questions remain underexplored such as: Does combining <b>credit</b> and <b>insurance</b> <b>services</b> improve or weaken overall organisational performance of micro-finance schemes? Does the combining of micro-finance services lead to more inclusion or to more exclusion of the poor? and; Are combined micro-finance schemes enhancing or challenging donor effectiveness? This paper builds on a literature review and is a first conceptual attempt to bring forward the specific characteristics of combined micro-finance schemes. It argues for a more formative evaluation approach towards combining micro-finance schemes. Market dynamics and interventions of the key players and stakeholders of combined micro-finance should aim at becoming most efficient, allowing maximum socio-economic benefits and efficiency, taking into account the different challenges of reaching the poor. ...|$|R

40|$|What is {{the optimal}} size and {{composition}} of Rural Financial Cooperatives (RFCs) ? With this broad question in mind, we characterize alternative formation of RFCs and their implications in improving the access of rural households to financial services, including savings, <b>credit,</b> and <b>insurance</b> <b>services.</b> We find that some features of RFCs have varying implications for delivering various financial services. The size of RFCs is {{found to have a}} nonlinear relationship with the various financial services RFCs provide. We also show that compositional heterogeneity among members, including diversity in wealth, is associated with higher access to credit services, while this has little implication on households’ savings behavior. Similarly, social cohesion among members is strongly associated with higher access to financial services. These empirical descriptions suggest that the optimal size {{and composition of}} RFCs may vary across the domains of financial services they are designed to facilitate. This evidence provides suggestive insights on how to ensure financial inclusion among smallholders, a pressing agenda and priority of policy makers in developing countries, including Ethiopia. The results also provide some insights into rural microfinance operations which are striving to satisfy members’ demand for financial services.

40|$|In rural Kazakhstan, the <b>credit</b> and <b>{{insurance}}</b> <b>services</b> {{are limited}} {{and the state}} support is weak. Therefore, households’ saving is crucial to provide an insurance against {{the economic and social}} shocks. The main goal {{of this study is to}} contribute to the literature on financial literacy in emerging economies, namely, the effect of financial literacy on saving rates of rural population. Being well educated not always means to be financial literate and make efficient decisions regarding one’s own finance. People with a lower formal education level but with better experience in consuming financial products could be better prepared for making financial decisions including those related to savings. In this paper other socio-economic determinants of saving rates were taken into account, such as an income level, family size and an employment status. This research was carried out in Pavlodar region of Kazakhstan, and the data collection took place in spring 2014. In total, 405 households were surveyed. Results of the analysis show that if a respondent gives at least one correct answer, it positively affects the saving rates as well as one can observe that the higher the financial literacy level, the higher are the saving rates. Availability of state supported financial education programs for rural people will significantly contribute to the financial literacy improvement. At the same time, providing various and appropriate financial products in rural areas will motivate rural people to search for new knowledge and require authorities to intensify activities in this field...|$|R
50|$|The {{fact that}} Japan’s farming {{population}} is in decline poses {{the greatest threat}} to JA’s continued dominance in the agricultural market and the group’s very existence. With less demand for agricultural inputs, JA’s wholesale business incurs more operating cost relative to sales. In fact, JA’s wholesale business has shown negative net profit in recent years. The loss is covered by surplus from JA’s financial services and asset management, supported by increased funding from its newly created “associate” membership that allows non-farmers to receive its <b>credit</b> and <b>insurance</b> <b>services.</b> JA has paid effort in nurturing new generations in the farming industry to raise productivity, but has proved unsuccessful. This is because the organization has simultaneously supported unproductive farmers who only work part-time in small-sized farmlands rather than promoting corporate farming and merger of farmland to reduce cost and raise productivity. Today (as of 2005), 62% of Japanese “farmers” work part-time and rely primarily on non-farming jobs. 16% rely primarily on farming but are still part-time, and only 23% are full-time farmers. The overwhelming majority of those full-time farmers are people who retired from their second job and returned to their farmlands. In aggregate, only 9.5% of the total farming population is full-time male farmers less than 65 years of age. JA’s rationale to perpetuate this structure is political. A group of 100 unproductive farmers translates into more votes in Diet elections and thus serves JA’s interests better than a group of 10 productive farmers.|$|R
