25|$|The Kemeny Commission {{noted that}} Babcock & Wilcox's {{pilot-operated}} relief valve had previously failed on 11occasions, {{nine of them}} in the open position, allowing coolant to escape. More disturbing, however, {{was the fact that the}} initial <b>causal</b> <b>sequence</b> of events at TMI had been duplicated 18months earlier at another Babcock & Wilcox reactor, the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station owned at that time by Toledo Edison. The only difference was that the operators at Davis-Besse identified the valve failure after 20minutes, where at TMI it took 80 minutes, and the Davis-Besse facility was operating at 9% power, against TMI's 97%. Although Babcock engineers recognized the problem, the company failed to clearly notify its customers of the valve issue.|$|E

50|$|Lengthy {{traditional}} narratives {{tend to have}} an episodic or picaresque character. Their unity comes {{mainly from}} {{the presence of a}} continuing central character or from a <b>causal</b> <b>sequence</b> of events, rather than from any overall theme, plot, or narrative purpose.|$|E
50|$|Objection: Ideas {{appear in}} a <b>causal</b> <b>sequence.</b> If ideas are mere {{superficial}} appearances without internal parts, {{what is the purpose}} of the complicated <b>causal</b> <b>sequence</b> in which they appear? It would be less effort for objects to appear as ideas with simple exterior surfaces, without so many internal connections. Answer: Scientists should not explain things as though they are effects of causes. The connection of ideas is a relationship between signs and the things that are signified. We should study our ideas as though they are informative signs in a language of nature. If we understand the language in which these idea-signs are used, then we understand how we can produce connections of ideas.|$|E

Besides, results highlighted the importance of the representation of complex events for the development of specific cognitive abilities...|$|R
5000|$|Whether a {{particular}} thing happens, says Aristotle, {{may depend on}} a series of causes that goes back to some starting-point, which does not go back to something else. This, therefore, will be the starting-point of the fortuitous, and nothing else is the cause of its generation.In general, many such <b>causal</b> <b>sequences</b> contribute to any event, including human decisions. Each sequence has a different time of origin, some going back before we were born, some originating during our deliberations. Beyond <b>causal</b> <b>sequences</b> that are the result of chance or necessity, Aristotle felt that some breaks in the causal chain allow us to feel our actions [...] "depend on us" [...] (ἐφ' ἡμῖν). These are the causal chains that originate within us (ἐv ἡμῖν).|$|R

50|$|Despite {{the views}} of certain South African writers, the Appellate Division in S v Goosen adopted the {{approach}} that has found favour among German criminal theorists: that the intention element (in consequence crimes) is not satisfied if the consequence occurs {{in a manner that}} differs markedly from {{the way in which the}} accused foresaw the <b>causal</b> <b>sequence.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... {{why is it}} {{necessary}} to invoke the theory of mistake as regards the <b>causal</b> <b>sequence?</b> Perhaps the answer {{may lie in the}} fact that in common-purposes cases (such as Goosen) the courts have specifically followed an approach which imputes the act of the perpetrator to the other participants in the common purpose, irrespective of whether the latter have contributed causally to the unlawful consequence or not. Their active participation in the common purpose coupled with the requisite guilty mind or fault is enough—either factual or legal causation between their association and the unlawful consequence is not required. The theory of mistake as regards the <b>causal</b> <b>sequence,</b> which is an aspect of mens rea, may thus be an important limiting device in cases of common-purpose liability, excluding liability for murder where death was foreseen by the participants in a common purpose, but death in fact occurred in an unexpected, or even bizarre, way.|$|E

In the life script, slots are {{culturally}} important transitional {{events that are}} expected to occur within a circumscribed age span in the life course of an individual; and, the requirement is the prescribed appropriate age for the culturally expected event that leads to <b>causal</b> <b>sequencing,</b> in a series of succeeding events.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a class of {{unstable}} non-monotonic global predicates, called herein atomic sequences of predicates. Such global predicates are defined for distributed programs built with message-passing communication only (no shared memory) and they describe global properties by causal composition of local predicates augmented with atomicity constraints. These constraints specify forbidden properties, whose occurrence invalidate <b>causal</b> <b>sequences.</b> This paper defines formally these atomic sequences of predicates, proposes a distributed algorithm to detect their occurences and gives a sketch of a proof of correctness of this algorithm...|$|R
50|$|His {{most famous}} work, though, is the De Vita Caesarum. This {{collection}} of twelve biographies tells {{the lives of}} the Julio-Claudian and Flavian Emperors, spanning from Julius Caesar to Domitian. Other than an introduction genealogy and a short summary of the subject’s youth and death, the biographies do not follow a chronological pattern. Rather than chronicling events as they happened in time, Suetonius presents them thematically. This style allowed him to compare the achievements and downfalls of each emperor using various examples of imperial responsibilities, such as building projects and public entertainment. However, it makes dating aspects of each emperor’s life and the events of the early Roman Empire difficult. It also completely removes the ability to extrapolate a <b>causal</b> <b>sequence</b> from the works. Suetonius’s purpose was not a historical recount of events, though, but rather an evaluation of the emperors themselves.|$|E
5000|$|Delayed choice {{experiments}} {{raise questions}} about time and time sequences, and thereby bring our usual ideas of time and <b>causal</b> <b>sequence</b> into question. [...] If events at D1, D2, D3, D4 determine outcomes at D0, then effect seems to precede cause. If the idler light paths were greatly extended so that a year goes by before a photon shows up at D1, D2, D3, or D4, then when a photon shows {{up in one of}} these detectors, it would cause a signal photon to have shown up in a certain mode a year earlier. Alternatively, knowledge of the future fate of the idler photon would determine the activity of the signal photon in its own present. Neither of these ideas conforms to the usual human expectation of causality. However, knowledge of the future, which would be a hidden variable, was refuted in experiments.|$|E
5000|$|A Virginia Durr Moment {{refers to}} those {{experiences}} which—when used correctly—foster moral development. A Virginia Durr Moment presents {{one with the}} opportunity for growth via the evolution of one's value system via seriously challenging one's value system in a manner which causes one to reflect on and, {{as a result of}} this reflection, reject it in whole or in part. When used correctly, the signature <b>causal</b> <b>sequence</b> of a Virginia Durr Moment consists in: serious challenge-->self-reflection-->modification of value system-->moral development. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to use the Moment to promote growth and further his/her moral development. In the United Kingdom, some circles understand Paul McCartney's Blackbird as describing the moral development fostered by the proper usage of a Virginia Durr Moment. An individual may experience a Virginia Durr Moment and fail to use its power, thereby remaining in a condition of developmental stasis and moral immaturity.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the reason}} that {{positive}} science, according to Giddens, is never possible in the social sciences: every time an investigator tries to identify <b>causal</b> <b>sequences</b> of action, the actors can change their further line of action. The problem is, however, that conflicting viewpoints in social science result in a disinterest of the people. For example, when scientists don't agree about the greenhouse-effect, people will withdraw from that arena, and deny that there is a problem. Therefore, the more the sciences expand, the more uncertainty there is in the modern society. In this regard, the juggernaut gets even more steerless.|$|R
40|$|Historical {{reversals}} highlight a basic methodological problem: is {{it possible}} to treat two successive periods both as independent cases to compare for causal analysis and as parts of a single historical sequence?

An alternative model which treats successive periods as contrasting solutions for recurrent problems offers two advantages. First, it more effectively combines analytical comparisons of different periods with narratives of <b>causal</b> <b>sequences</b> spanning two or more periods. Second, it better integrates scholarly accounts of historical reversals with actors’ own narratives of the past...|$|R

50|$|There is one {{situation}} in which an intervening act or event that would ordinarily qualify as a novus actus interveniens will not be regarded as such. This occurs when the intervening act or event was actually planned, intended or foreseen by the accused, {{in the sense that}} it was a calculated part of the <b>causal</b> <b>sequence.</b> As some authorities put it, intended consequences can never (almost by definition) be “too remote” to found liability. The relevant principle has been explained by the Appellate Division, which ruled in Ex parte die Minister van Justisie: In re S v Grotjohn that, where the act is a calculated part of the chain of causation which the perpetrator started, and is an eventuality which the perpetrator foresees as a possibility, and which he desires to employ to obtain his object, it would be contrary to accepted principles of law, and to all sense of justice, to allow him to take shelter behind the act as a novus actus interveniens.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} be an object of study and analysis, time has to be {{transformed}} into a <b>causal</b> <b>sequence,</b> and the only way in which this can be done is by narration. As a form of description, narrating inevitably requires sequencing in time. The direction of time is not a trivial thing, but the backbone of the information contained in the narrative itself. One has to bear in mind the fundamental concepts of Genette’s narratology, mainly the concept of ‘order.’ This distinguishes three entities: story, narrative, and narration. The story generally corresponds to a series of events placed its chronological order (the story time). When these events are rearranged and represented in a form that has its own sequence and features by the author, it produces a narrative. [...] Even if the narrated events are not chronologically ordered, being reported in the narrative’s time, they always refer to a position in the story time.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{also clear}} that a doctor’s {{inability}} {{to save the life of}} a victim who is already moribund or dying is not a novus actus interveniens. Whether the withdrawal of a life-support system by a medical practitioner may be regarded as a novus actus arose in S v Williams, where it was held that such medical conduct did not break the <b>causal</b> <b>sequence</b> set in motion by Williams, who had shot the deceased, thereby inflicting those initial wounds on the deceased which had necessitated her being put on the respirator in the first place. Within 48 hours, she had been pronounced brain-dead, and the respirator duly disconnected. When Williams was tried for her murder, he claimed that he had not been the cause of her death; it was, rather, the conduct of the doctors in disconnecting the respirator. On being convicted, he appealed to the Appellate Division, where the court distinguished between [...] "ending a fruitless attempt to save life" [...] and a positive act causing death, and held that, since the injury inflicted by Williams had been a mortal or life-threatening one, and since the deceased was being kept alive only by artificial means, the doctors did not cause her death when they disconnected the respirator. They were merely ending a fruitless attempt to save her life. Williams’s conviction was therefore upheld.|$|E

40|$|Scenario {{languages}} {{based on}} Message Sequence Charts (MSCs) and related notations {{have been widely}} studied {{in the last decade}} [14, 13, 2, 9, 6, 12, 8]. The high expressive power of scenarios renders many basic problems concerning these languages undecidable. The most expressive class for which several problems are known to be decidable is one which possesses a behavioral property called “existentially bounded”. However, scenarios outside this class are frequently exhibited by asynchronous distributed systems such as sliding window protocols. We propose here an extension of MSCs called <b>Causal</b> Message <b>Sequence</b> Charts, which preserves decidability without requiring existential bounds. Interestingly, it can also model scenarios from sliding window protocols. We establish the expressive power and complexity of decision procedures for various subclasses of <b>Causal</b> Message <b>Sequence</b> Charts...|$|R
