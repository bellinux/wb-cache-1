A system consists of modified domestic microwave oven and silicon based chemical demulsifiers {{was used to}} dehydrate two types of petroleum crude oils from Middle East. Silicone based additives which claimed to be nontoxic are {{used in conjunction with}} the modified microwave oven. The currently available demulsification techniques that consist mainly of chemicals together with mechanical, heating and electrical methods have some drawbacks, since chemicals are costly and harmful to the environment, mechanical techniques such as gravity settling tank, hydro <b>cyclone</b> vessel, <b>centrifugal</b> <b>separators,</b> and steam stripping are large requiring more space, time and cost, electrical techniques almost always work in a very high voltage that can easily cause fire via short circuit. Therefore, the objective of this project is to introduce the Microwave Dehydrator (MD) as a step forward to the commercialization of the microwave treatment of petroleum based emulsions. This is to replace or reduce the use of chemical dehydrators in the oil field. Simulated experimental model emulsions of various crude oils were produced to mimic the real emulsions.

Further, it has been faced the problems due to the soil dusts. to identify a filtering system capable of reducing the great amounts of dusts introduced in the environment during the process of hazelnuts picking up by means turbo-aspirating machines. The main types of dust removers for medium-thin dusts have been studied and examined; a comparative exam proved the mechanical removal by <b>cyclone</b> (<b>centrifugal</b> dust <b>separator)</b> to be the most effective.

30|$|Based on the {{knowledge}} of the gas–solid separation and experience in industrial application, China University of Petroleum (Beijing) has been working on the development of this separation technology for more than 20  years (Liu et al. 2005, 2007; Lu et al. 2007, 2008 a, b; Yan et al. 2007).
