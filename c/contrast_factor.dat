25|$|Psychopathy, as {{measured}} with the PCL-R in institutional settings, shows in meta-analyses small to moderate effect sizes with institutional misbehavior, postrelease crime, or postrelease violent crime with similar effects {{for the three}} outcomes. Individual studies give similar results for adult offenders, forensic psychiatric samples, community samples, and youth. The PCL-R is poorer at predicting sexual re-offending. This small to moderate effect appears to be due largely to the scale items that assess impulsive behaviors and past criminal history, which are well-established but very general risk factors. The aspects of core personality often held to be distinctively psychopathic generally show little or no predictive link to crime by themselves. For example, Factor 1 of the PCL-R and Fearless dominance of the PPI-R have smaller or no relationship to crime, including violent crime. In <b>contrast,</b> <b>Factor</b> 2 and Impulsive antisociality of the PPI-R are associated more strongly with criminality. Factor 2 has a relationship of similar strength {{to that of the}} PCL-R as a whole. The antisocial facet of the PCL-R is still predictive of future violence after controlling for past criminal behavior which, together with results regarding the PPI-R which by design does not include past criminal behavior, suggests that impulsive behaviors is an independent risk factor. Thus, the concept of psychopathy may perform poorly when attempted {{to be used as a}} general theory of crime.|$|E

5000|$|The sign of {{the force}} {{represents}} {{the direction of the}} force. A negative sign means an attractive interparticle force, whereas a positive sign means a repulsive force. The left side of the equation depends on the acoustic particle velocity amplitude [...] and the right side depends on the acoustic pressure amplitude [...] When particles are lined up {{in the direction of the}} acoustic wave propagation (θ=0˚) the velocity-dependent term is repulsive, and likewise attractive when the particles are perpendicular (θ=90˚) to the incident wave propagation. The pressure-dependent term is not affected by the particle orientation at all and is always attractive. In the case of positive <b>contrast</b> <b>factor,</b> the velocity-dependent term diminishes as particles are driven to the velocity node (pressure antinode), as in the case of air bubbles and lipid vesicles. In a similar way the pressure-dependent term diminishes as particles are driven towards the pressure node (velocity antinode), as are most solid particles in aqueous solutions. The influence of the secondary forces is usually very weak, due to the distance term d in the denominator, which means that it is only effective when the distance between particles is very small. The secondary force becomes important in aggregation and sedimentation applications, where particles initially are gathered in nodes by the acoustic radiation force, and as interparticle distances become smaller the secondary forces assist in a further aggregation until the clusters finally become heavy enough for the gravity to overcome the buoyancy and start the sedimentation process.|$|E
3000|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the origin of anisotropic strain broadening and test the validity of the assumption made in the previous section, it is essential to perform the modified Williamson–Hall analysis as proposed by Ungar et al. [18]. The anisotropy observed in the broadening of the diffraction lines is partly due to geometrical factors such as the orientation of the burgers vector and the dislocation line vector and partly due to anisotropic elastic constants. In the present analysis, it is considered that all the slip systems are equally populated so that we can use the average <b>contrast</b> <b>factor</b> for the dislocations. In order to rationalize the anisotropy of integral breadths observed in conventional W–H plot, modified W–H analysis was performed for both the Ni 1 and Ni 2 subcomponents. The average <b>contrast</b> <b>factor</b> of dislocation for each hkl reflection is given according to the relation C_hkl = C_h 00 ([...] 1 - qH^ 2) [...] [19, 20, 21] where Chkl is the dislocation <b>contrast</b> <b>factor</b> for hkl reflection and Ch 00 is the corresponding dislocation <b>contrast</b> <b>factor</b> for h 00 -type reflection and [...] H^ 2 = ([...] h^ 2 k^ 2 + h^ 2 l^ 2 + k^ 2 l^ 2)/([...] h^ 2 + k^ 2 + l^ 2)^ 2.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} {{for the detection of}} face regions where the facial features such as eyes, nose, and mouth may exist with very high probability. It uses the characteristic of DCT(discrete cosine transformation) that concentrates the energy of an image into lower frequency coefficients. Since the facial features are pertained to relatively high frequency in a face image, the inverse DCT after removing the DCT's coefficients corresponding to the lower frequencies generates the image where the facial feature regions are emphasized. For an efficient application of the proposed method, homomorphic filter is used with the global <b>contrast</b> <b>factor.</b> The DCT coefficients are eliminated so that the global <b>contrast</b> <b>factor</b> can be maximized. Once the inverse DCTed image is obtained, the face region is found by analyzing the topology of facial features. The proposed algorithm has been tested with various images collected randomly.
