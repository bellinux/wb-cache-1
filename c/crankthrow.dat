5000|$|Crankshafts on six-cylinder engines {{generally}} have either four or seven main bearings. Larger engines and diesels {{tend to use}} seven bearings because of high loadings and to avoid crankshaft flex. Because of the six-cylinder engine's smooth characteristic, {{there is a tendency}} for a driver to load the engine at low engine speeds. This can produce crankshaft flex in four main bearing designs where the crank spans the distance of two cylinders between main bearings. This distance is longer than the distance between two adjacent main bearings on a V6 with four mains, because the V6 has cylinder bores on opposite banks which overlap significantly; the overlap may be as high as 100%, minus the width of one connecting rod (1.00" [...] or so). In addition, modern high-compression engines subject the crankshaft to greater bending loads from higher peak gas pressures, requiring the <b>crankthrows</b> to have greater support from adjacent bearings, so it is now customary to design straight-sixes with seven main bearings.|$|R
40|$|Shrinkage {{finite element}} method. Through a {{finite element method}} study, here we have {{simulated}} the crankshaft 2 D (two-dimensional) plane stress condition without taking account into the thermal effect and the stress and geometric vari-ations. In particular, research for the contact problem is challeng-ing, mainly {{due to the fact}} that this process is characteristic of a 3 D (three-dimensional) non-linear behavior, for which it is too dif-ficult to describe within the traditional method (i. e., plane stress method). However, the 3 D FEM (finite element method) has an obvious advantage of treating these non-linear behaviors. sels, which acts as the heart of engine. Shrink fit is widely used to assemble an integrated marine crankshaft. Due to the super size of each part (i. e., one integrated crankshaft usually weights from 50 to 200 tons, and 5 – 15 m in length), the shrink fitting process needs accurately design to ensure the journals to be assembled in the same alignment while the <b>crankthrows</b> are fixed in a certain angle (120). Note that any inconsiderate design may cause a severe fail-ure for the whole crankshaft. The most serious problem is that the shrink fit bore may expand non-uniformly in heating process be-cause of an unsymmetrical geometry that brings difficulty to the follow-up inserting process. Moreover, the whole crankshaft wil...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{conventional}} {{method of}} bending the large <b>crankthrow</b> was investigated by computer simulation combined with manufacturing trial, and the typical forging defects, such as constricted waist, folded cracks and horn mouth on forged blank were analyzed. On {{the basis of}} these results, a novel forging shape of preformed blank was proposed using anti-transformation method by computer simulation. The FEM simulated results show that all the above defects can be avoided by carrying out the novel method, furthermore, the maximum resistance of the novel bending deformation was reduced to 72 % of conventional process, and the weight of forging blank can be decreased by 15 %. Finally, the optimum forging shape was applied to the actual process, the simulation results were confirmed by manufacturing trial, and qualified forged piece was gained. The FEM model established can be used for further optimization of other types of <b>crankthrow...</b>|$|E

Based on the {{measured}} CCT diagram of steel S 34 MnV, the parameters for the heat treatment of large marine <b>crankthrow</b> were designed, and the models for predicting microstructural evolution and mechanical properties were developed. By computer simulation, {{the temperature and}} phase volume evolutions in the controlled cooling process were predicted together with the final mechanical properties. Finally, the manufactural trial {{was carried out in}} heavy plant, the temperature evolution and final mechanical properties on the blank were obtained. The manufactural data agree well with the predicted results...|$|E
40|$|The {{crankshaft}} is {{a complex}} component, and as such, the influence of its geometric parameters on stresses seen under service loads is not well understood. The objectives of this work are to investigate {{the effects of a}} wide range of geometric parameters on stresses in overlapped crankshafts, to find correlation between results and to formulate simple methods of predicting peak stress levels: It is intended to achieve this by use of the Finite Element (FE) and Boundary Element (BE) methods. Individual crankthrows are loaded under the important load cases of bending and torsion. Stress concentration factors are determined by normalising peak stresses with respect to the nominal stress occurring in the most appropriate section in the neck between the fillets. Analyses are carried out in 2 D and 3 D, making use of symmetry as far as possible. Many of the governing dimensions of the <b>crankthrow</b> are included in the analyses; crankpin and journal diameters, crankpin and journal overlap, and web thickness. Variations in SCF are plotted over a wide range for each of these parameters. Additionally, features such as fillet size and shape, bore-holes, dimples, cut-back webs and oil holes are investigated. It is found that the effects on stress of individual parameter changes can be superimposed to accurately predict the effect of combining various parameter changes in one model. The crankpin and journal fillet radii and the length of the minimum section between the fillets are shown to be the critical parameters in determining the peak stress levels in the crankshaft. SCFs obtained from the range of analyses performed show good agreement with the classical theory of SCFs in notched bars. Bore-holes and dimples are found to offer significant benefits in terms of peak stress reduction, in addition to their common usage of reducing the out of balance crankpin mass. The FE and BE methods give accurate results for stress analysis of crankshafts and offer several advantages over traditional experimental techniques; they are ideally suited to parametric analyses, can be carried out relatively quickly, results are repeatable because boundary conditions can be exactly defined, and the cost of analysis is significantly reduced...|$|E
