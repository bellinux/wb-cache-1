25|$|Donor {{coordination}} in Lebanon is {{the responsibility}} of a donor <b>coordination</b> <b>unit</b> in the Ministry of Finance, which itself is supported by UNDP. In many countries where multiple donors provide aid to the water and sanitation sector there is some form of a water-specific donor coordination mechanism. This {{does not seem to be}} the case in Lebanon.|$|E
25|$|Other Ministries {{also play}} a role in the water and {{sanitation}} sector. The Ministry of Education cooperates with MWI and MoPHS in the area of school sanitation by participating in Water and Sanitation Programme Committees. The Agricultural Sector <b>Coordination</b> <b>Unit</b> deliberates on all issues related to agriculture, including irrigation which is overseen by MWI. The MWI also co-operates with the Ministries of Forestry, of the Environment and of Special Programmes to further the rehabilitation and maintenance of water towers.|$|E
25|$|There has {{nevertheless}} been widespread {{criticism that}} ALF spokespersons and activists have either failed to condemn {{acts of violence}} or have themselves engaged in it, either {{in the name of}} the ALF or under another banner. The criticism has been accompanied by dissent within the animal rights movement itself about the use of violence, and increasing attention from the police and intelligence communities. In 2002 the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which monitors extremism in the United States, noted the involvement of the ALF in the Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty campaign, which SPLC identified as using terrorist tactics—though a later SPLC report also noted that they have not killed anyone. In 2005 the ALF was included in a United States Department of Homeland Security planning document listing a number of domestic terrorist threats on which the U.S. government expected to focus resources. In the UK, ALF actions are regarded as examples of domestic extremism, and are handled by the National Extremism Tactical <b>Coordination</b> <b>Unit,</b> set up in 2004 to monitor ALF and other illegal animal rights activity.|$|E

General Division handles policy matters relating to station procedures; the security and management of the Police Headquarters (PHQ) complex; and diverse other duties. During the year, the Division {{played a major role in}} the streamlining of station procedures; making arrangements for the reallocation of offices and facilities; formulating a new policy for parking at the PHQ as required by the PHQ Redevelopment Project and such other duties as coordinating the Force involvement in the District Council elections.

Each AgI atom is three coordinated in a T-shaped geometry by three N atoms from three ligands. Each ligand links three AgI atoms, generating a two-dimensional network structure with two different metallacycles, A and B. In A, eight <b>coordination</b> <b>units</b> from four ligands connect four AgI atoms, forming a 48 -membered ring. In B, four <b>coordination</b> <b>units</b> from two ligands link two AgI atoms, forming a 24 -membered ring.

30|$|Key to the {{distinction}} between the construction of a MSPF and the GMSF, children’s simultaneous <b>coordination</b> of <b>units</b> was documented as a developmental prerequisite {{for the construction of a}} GMSF; however, simultaneous <b>coordination</b> of <b>units</b> was not found to be a developmental prerequisite for the construction of a MSPF. Although the construction of a MSPF was found to be positively related with the simultaneous coordination of three levels of units, several students were documented to have constructed a MSPF without simultaneously coordinating three levels of units. However, no students were found to have constructed a GMSF without first being able to simultaneously coordinate three levels of units. This finding is consistent with the proposed learning progression, in that some children who are only able to coordinate a three-level structure sequentially as two two-level structures can still solve tasks like that presented in Fig.  4 (a task designed to indicate the construction of a MSPF). However, this sequential <b>coordination</b> of <b>units</b> is not sufficient for the construction of a GMSF, which is required for tasks like the one presented in Fig.  5.|$|R
