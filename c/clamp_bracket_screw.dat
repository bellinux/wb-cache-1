50|$|An {{eccentric}} is a {{cylindrical plug}} or bearing cup that fits into an enlarged bottom bracket shell. The plug is machined {{to accept a}} typical bottom bracket, but offset {{from the center of}} the plug, so that by rotating the plug, the location of the bottom bracket (and hence the chain tension) may be adjusted (fore and aft to tension the chain, the upper or lower eccentric position for a given chain length can be chosen to fine tune bottom bracket height).

50|$|Electric griddles are {{typically}} {{made of a}} thinner plate material than a similar gas griddle to improve the heat transfer between the bottom-mounted elements and the cooking surface. Elements used to heat the griddle {{are typically}} 4-5 kilowatt (kW) per linear foot, and made from round rod sheathed incoloy material whose geometry is designed to optimize temperature distribution across the plate.

5000|$|In 1950 Mercury {{engineers}} {{came out}} with the Super 10 Hurricane, Model KG-7. This motor was based on previous models KE-7 Lightning and KF-7 Super 10. Upgrades included redesigned connecting rods, upgraded aluminum <b>clamp</b> and swivel <b>brackets,</b> a new high RPM magneto, improved porting, an 8 Reed valve cage (as opposed to KE-7 and KF-7’s 4) and larger crankcase opening. Hurricane was also advertised at 10 hp*, way below the actual horsepower developed, Mercury noted this asterisk by stating that horsepower varies with rpm; really the Hurricane could deliver up to 18 hp. Shortly after the introduction of the Hurricane, Mercury came up with their first performance gear case with the capability of mating to a standard driveshaft housing of a KG-7 or similar green top engine of the time. This was named “Quicksilver” and promised an extra 20 to 30% increase in top speed. Essentially, it boasted a significantly slimmer pointed gear case that housed an integrated rubber rotex water pump and forward only 1:1 gears along with the necessary bearings. After a few months of use, Mercury found that the average race boat's transom would not elevate the standard driveshaft housing and quicksilver gear case high enough for peak performance. Rectifying this problem, Mercury developed the Quicksilver driveshaft housing. This new driveshaft housing was three inches shorter which in turn lowered the motor's center of gravity on the boat which helped turning ability, reduced the strain on the boat's transom and motor's <b>clamp</b> <b>brackets,</b> and decreased underwater drag while increasing top speed as less gearcase was below the boat. In addition the motor had a sort-of cut down lower anti-cavitation plate, protruding forward upper anti-cavitation plate (spray plate), a stronger rear-mounted steering bar design, and finally, an exhaust opening above the water surface that reduced exhaust back pressure while increasing noise levels when the boat was on plane. When the dealer installed the quicksilver driveshaft housing and gear case (packaged at $82.25) he had authorization to hand stamp a small [...] "Q" [...] behind the serial numbers on the tag and block. Some did, some did not - and so, the [...] "Stamped Q" [...] came to be. 1951 saw the first production race-ready outboard models; KG-4Q, KG7-Q, and KG-9Q. These motors were pulled off the production line at random, given the quicksilver gear case, driveshaft housing, and [...] "Q" [...] stamp behind the tag serial number and block serial number. These KG-7Qs worked fine on runabouts but were too long for hydroplanes - and the racers made this known to Mercury. So thus was born the 2" [...] shorter [...] "H" [...] driveshaft housing in 1952. Right before Mercury released this [...] "H" [...] driveshaft housing, they still had several [...] "Q" [...] length driveshaft housings, so they introduced a factory KG-7Q which had a green silk screened Q behind the serial number on the tag and a factory stamped [...] "Q" [...] on the block. These motors are very rare; they fall into the serial range of 532404-532963.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{developing}} {{finite element models}} and subsequent sensitivity and reliability analyses to evaluate the probability of disproportionate collapse of a twelve-storey case study Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT) building, following extreme loading events such as earthquakes. As an initial damage, the methodology mimics event - independent scenarios that include a sudden removal of a vertical loadbearing element. This investigation emphasises on the rotational stiffness (k) of the joints by considering nonlinear dynamic analyses of the structure at global, component and connection levels. The rotational stiffness demand required to prevent disproportionate collapse is checked against the supply {{at all levels of}} structural idealisation. A sensitivity analysis at the sub - frame level shows that an improved structural detailing, to carry tie forces between structural members, as well as adequate thickness of structural elements, are important to prevent disproportionate collapse. The reliability analysis of the optimised structural model proves that the required k value, to develop resistance mechanisms, is too large to be practically achieved by means of common CLT joint detailing, which is provided by angle <b>brackets</b> and <b>screws.</b> As a result, connection detailing and size of members of the case study building need to be re-evaluated in order to avoid disproportionate collapse in the twelve-storey CLT building...|$|R

Moreover, an over-strength factor of 1.6 was provided for screwed connections. Schneider et al. [3, 4] defined the energy-based cumulative damage index for CLT connections. The relations between the damage index and physical connection damage were provided. For the studies on CLT wall panels, experimental results from Ceccotti et al.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the seismic design of multi-storey buildings made from cross-laminated timber panels (‘crosslam’). The use of seismic analysis {{methods such as}} the modal response spectrum and the non-linear static (push-over) analysis is discussed at length, including {{issues such as the}} modelling of crosslam walls and connections, the evaluation of the connection stiffness, and the schematization of floor panels. It was found that it is crucial to account for the flexibility of the connections (hold-downs and angle brackets) between upper and lower walls, since otherwise the vibration periods of the building would be underestimated. The basics of capacity design to ensure the attainment of ductile mechanisms in crosslam timber structures under seismic actions are presented. The ductile failure mechanism is characterized by plasticization of connectors (hold-downs, angle <b>brackets</b> and <b>screws)</b> between adjacent wall panels and between panels and foundations. The crosslam panels and the connections between adjacent floor panels must be designed for the overstrength of the connectors to ensure that they remain elastic during the earthquake and the ductile failure mechanism is attained. Based on the results of preliminary quasi-static cyclic tests, a value of 1. 3 was found for the overstrength factors of hold-downs and angle brackets. A case study multi-storey crosslam massive wooden building was then analysed using the non-linear push-over analysis as implemented in the N 2 method recommended by the Eurocode 8. The building was modelled using shell elements and non-linear links to schematize the hold-downs and angle brackets. The building ductility, calculated from the bilinear curve equivalent to the actual non-linear push-over curve, was then investigated. Such a quantity, defined as the ratio of the displacement at the near collapse state and the maximum elastic displacement of the top floor, was found to rise from 1. 7 to 2. 5 when ductile instead of brittle hold-downs and angle brackets are used. Furthermore, the maximum peak ground acceleration the building can resist raised from 0. 2 g to 0. 4 g, demonstrating the importance of using ductile connectors in seismic design...|$|R

On site the 706 would have its case removed, the front two feet knocked out, the instrument cord removed and the dial turned round through 180 degrees. The <b>bracket</b> was then <b>screwed</b> to the wall, the baseplate mounted on the bracket and the fixed wiring, having been led in via {{a hole in the}} baseplate, was terminated in place of the instrument cord. The two metal bezels by which the case was fastened to the chassis were removed and replaced by the new switchhook assembly. This had a bridging piece, like the carrying handle, but with two large hooks to stop the handset falling to the floor. If the instrument had an early dial bezel, carrying the letters and numbers, then this too had to be rotated 180 degrees. When reassembled, the result was an untidy compromise. It looked like what it was, an upside-down 706 with its handset hanging ungainly from the bottom and the curly cord dangling beneath. It was a relief to all concerned when all the above became unnecessary with the introduction of a purpose-built instrument.|$|R
40|$|Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT) {{is gaining}} a {{significant}} popularity among the structural products as a sustainable alternative to steel and concrete. In comparison with those traditional building materials, CLT {{has a low}} carbon footprint and provides comfortable living conditions; moreover, the high strength-to-weight ratio, the prefabrication process and the erection speed are additional key points of its broad diffusion. Determining the load-carrying capacity of lateral load-resisting systems made of CLT panels (such as CLT wall systems, i. e. CLT walls with mechanical connections) is crucial for both the static and seismic design of CLT structures. However, a calculation method {{has not yet been}} included in Eurocode 5 (EN 1995 - 1 - 1 : 2004 /A 2 2014). Nowadays, the load-carrying capacity of CLT wall systems is determined with forcebased design procedures. However, since the analysis neglects the connections stiffness, those methods do not ensure that the wall system behaves in accordance with the design assumptions. Furthermore, simplified methods neglect some contributions that might affect the response of a CLT wall system, like the friction between the wall and the element that is restrained to and the effect of the overlaying floor. Based on the above-mentioned issues, this paper proposes a new numerical model of a CLT wall system. The model schematizes the CLT panel as an elastic orthotropic element, while the connections (i. e. hold-downs, angle <b>brackets,</b> and <b>screws)</b> are simulated as non-linear hysteretic springs. The interaction between the CLT panel and the foundation, and between the wall element and the CLT floor restrained on top of it, were specifically addressed {{in the development of the}} model. The study presented herein is carried out considering the experimental tests results obtained by Gavric et al. (2015 a- 2015 b- 2015 c). At first, experimental and numerical results are compared. A parametric study is carried out afterwards, (a) by varying the vertical load applied on top of the CLT wall, (b) by modifying the aspect ratio of the timber panel, and (c) by simulating a CLT floor screwed on top of the wall. Results are collected in diagrams and compared with a simplified design procedure commonly adopted by practicing engineers and discussed by Pozza et al. (2016 b), highlighting how those contributions influence the elastic stiffness and the load-carrying capacity of a CLT wall system...|$|R
40|$|Cold forming {{generally}} {{allows the}} reproduction of parts with a high production rate and low waste of material. For this reason, many small parts for example {{of the body of}} a smartphone undergo at least one forming operation during their fabrication, e. g. <b>screws,</b> <b>brackets</b> or springs. However, when the size of forming products is reduced to the micro range, size effects appear and affect the forming process. One size effect leads to the fact that conventional multi stage upsetting processes cannot be scaled to micro range accordingly. As a consequence, the maximum achievable upset ratio decreases from 2. 3 in macro range to values below 2 in micro range. This reduces the efficiency of the upsetting process significantly as more upsetting stages have to be carried out to reach the desired shape of the forming product. A very promising approach to reduce required forming stages is the laser rod end melting process which takes advantage of a size effect. Herein, the lower end of a rod is melted by the energy of a laser beam. The molten part of the rod automatically forms spherical due to surface tension. This droplet-shaped part is called “preform”. After total cooling, the preform is upset within a single stage cold forming operation to achieve the desired shape. In this paper, results of the upsetting operation with regard to surface accuracy of the forming product are presented. It is shown that surface characteristics with dimensions as small as 500 [*]nm can be reasonably reproduced...|$|R

40|$|Chapter VIII Research summary and conclusionWhen {{metallic}} prosthetic {{appliances and}} dental fillings {{exist in the}} oral cavity, the appearance of metal-induced streak artifacts is not avoidable in CT images. The general objective of this research work was to reduce the metal-induced streak artifacts using successive iterative reconstruction method. ML-EM and OS-EM algorithms were analyzed and used in this study. Besides streak artifact reduction, 3 D filtering method and region growing method were applied to improve image quality. 8. 1 Research summaryIn Chapter I, discipline of medical imaging was introduced. Among several medical imaging modalities, X-ray CT was emphatically introduced from its tomography principles to its application. Artifacts which were usually observed on CT images were analyzed and sorted to several kinds. Although the traditional CT reconstruction method, the FBP algorithm, had been widely applied, it could not deal {{with the loss of}} portions on projection data which was caused by extremely high X-ray absorption coefficients of metallic biomaterials. Image reconstruction algorithms that can use the corrupted projection data were expected. In Chapter II, the regularly used image format, DICOM, was introduced firstly. It is the abbreviation of digital imaging and communication in medicine. Fundamental composition of DICOM images was expressed. Special information about patient and examination are contained in DICOM images. Image size, bits allocation were analyzed subsequently. Two medical image displaying software, Image J and OsiriX, were introduced. We used Image J to display and analyze 2 D images. We used OsiriX to present 3 D volume rendering. In Chapter III, projection data acquisition on X-ray CT modality was instructed in detail. All the projection data were acquired in 360 directions with 1 degree intervals in this study. Then, iterative restoration methods as CT image reconstruction algorithms, ML-EM and OS-EM, were proposed. The two algorithms both result in an approximation between the processing image and the target image. A 3 × 3 matrix reconstruction by ML-EM algorithm was simulated. It simply demonstrated the image reconstruction process. Only 26 iterative calculations reached the target matrix. However, much more iterations were estimated to be needed for reconstructing 512 × 512 CT images. Subsequently, convergence validation of both ML-EM and OS-EM algorithms were carried out on practical images. It can be concluded that almost 300 iterations were needed to reconstruct the practical image by ML-EM, while the iteration times was about 50 for OS-EM algorithm to reconstruct the same image. The OS-EM algorithm can reconstruct image data faster without image quality dropped and it is usually used to reduce the calculation time. In Chapter IV, variable optimization of ML-EM algorithm was tested when using in streak artifact reduction. 50 iterations could reach a best artifact reduction effect. More than 50 iterations could not improve the effect any more. Then we applied the ML-EM on a sequential CT images to reduce artifacts using the same artifact-free image’s projection data. For OS-EM algorithm, the best parameter combination was proved to be subset = 8 and iteration = 10. In Chapter V, we proposed the successive iterative reconstruction method (SIRM) {{based on the fact that}} adjacent CT images often depict very similar anatomical structures within the resulting collection of thin-slice images. We used SIRM in streak artifact reduction in dento-alveolar region. First the projection data of the artifact-free slice was obtained. The adjacent slice, which showed weak artifacts, was processed using the artifact-free slice’s projection data. Then the projection data of the newly processed image was obtained and it was used to reconstruct the next image which contained a little more artifacts. In this manner, the processing continued until the heave streak artifact containing image was processed. Two alternative algorithms were tested in processing sequential images for artifact reduction with SIRM. In Chapter VI, SIRM was clinically applied in streak artifact reduction. Images before and after sagittal split ramus osteotomy operation (a jaw deformity case) were processed. The method was also proved to be effective in reducing artifacts caused by orthodontic wire, <b>brackets,</b> bone <b>screws</b> or titanium plates. Calculation acceleration was realized by general purpose graphic processing unit (GPGPU). In Chapter VII, SIRM was applied in cone-beam CT images for streak artifact reduction. Cone-beam CT has become increasingly important in treatment planning and diagnosis in dentistry of endodontics or orthodontics. Besides, 3 D filtering method and region growing method with dilation and erosion were employed for image quality improvement. 8. 2 ConclusionThe dissertation has presented a better solution for metal-induced streak artifacts reduction in X-ray CT images. ML-EM and OS-EM algorithm were both proved to be effective in artifacts reduction. Successive iterative reconstruction method reduced the deviations on edge of anatomical structure. GPGPU processing realized the calculation acceleration. Image quality improvement was also realized in three dimensional level...|$|R
