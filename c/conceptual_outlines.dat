50|$|Wundt's {{concepts}} {{were developed}} during almost 60 {{years of research}} and teaching that led him from neurophysiology to psychology and philosophy. The interrelationships between physiology, philosophy, logic, epistemology and ethics are therefore essential for an understanding of Wundt's psychology. The core of Wundt's areas of interest and guiding ideas can already be seen in his Vorlesungen über die Menschen- und Tierseele (Lectures on Human and Animal Psychology) of 1863: individual psychology (now known as general psychology, i.e. areas such as perception, attention, apperception, volition, will, feelings and emotions); cultural psychology (Wundt's Völkerpsychologie) as development theory of the human mind); animal psychology; and neuropsychology. The initial <b>conceptual</b> <b>outlines</b> of the 30-year-old Wundt (1862, 1863) led to a long research programme, to {{the founding of the}} first Institute and to the treatment of psychology as a discipline, as well as to a range of fundamental textbooks and numerous other publications.|$|E

Thus, primary tumor cells invade locally, enter into the circulation (intravasation), are transported through the circulation, are lodged in microvessels in distant tissues, invade the parenchyma of such tissue (extravasation) and form micrometastatic deposits, some of which eventually grow into macroscopic metastases, the last process being termed colonization.

40|$|The article {{examines}} {{the work of the}} French social philosopher and feminist Jenny P. d'Héricourt, who, in the mid-nineteenth century, debated the writings of contemporary `master-thinkers' such as Auguste Comte, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Jules Michelet. Usually ranged exclusively as a contribution to feminist thought, d'Héricourt's writing has also to be understood as a contribution to the <b>conceptual</b> <b>outlines</b> and defining questions of emerging sociology. The stated objective of her main work, La femme affranchie, was not to explain society but to claim equality for women. However, it was precisely her critique of contemporary theories of sexual difference and gender inequality that led d'Héricourt into the territory of sociological thinking — the very same territory her opponents had left by devoting themselves {{to the creation of a}} dualistic and asymmetrical concept of gender relations which relied upon women's supposed adversity towards modernity. In her effort to render women's role as agents of modernization visible, d'Héricourt developed, albeit in fragments, a theorem of social integration in modern society that anticipates Émile Durkheim's concept of organic solidarity...|$|E
40|$|Human {{security}} provides one of {{the most}} important protections; a person-centred axis of freedom from fear, from want and to live with dignity. It is surprising given its centrality to the human experience, that its connection with human rights has not yet been explored in a truly systematic way. This important new book addresses that gap in the literature by analysing whether human security might provide the tools for an expansive and integrated interpretation of international human rights. The examination takes a two-part approach. Firstly, it evaluates convergences between human security and all human rights – civil, political, economic, social and cultural – and constructs an investigative framework focused on the human security-human rights synergy. It then goes on to explore its practical application in the thematic cores of violence against women and undocumented migrants in the law and case-law of UN, European, Inter-American and African human rights bodies. It takes both a legal and interdisciplinary approach, recognising that human security and its relationship with human rights cuts across disciplinary boundaries. Innovative and rigorous, this is an important contribution to human rights scholarship. Introduction Part I: <b>Conceptual</b> <b>Outlines</b> 1. Human Security: An Overview 2.

40|$|Virtual {{water has}} been {{proposed}} as a mechanism with potential to reduce the effects of water scarcity on food security. To evaluate the role of virtual water in reducing the effect of water scarcity on food security, all components of the available water resource in agricultural areas must be quantified to {{provide a basis for}} evaluating food imports driven by water scarcity. We refer to this situation as ‘agri-compatible connections’ among water scarcity, virtual water, and food security. To date, this has not been captured in the literature on water scarcity, virtual water flows and food security. The lack of agri-compatibility has rendered the virtual water concept seemingly inconsistent with trade theories and water-food security policy needs. We propose two requirements for achieving agri-compatible connections: (i) the limit of crop production imposed by water scarcity should be captured by quantifying all components of the water available to satisfy specific crop water requirement in the importing economy, and (ii) food import should satisfy ‘water-dependent food security’ need, which is the actual or potential food security gap created by insufficient available water from all sources for crop production (all other things being equal). Further, we propose that agri-compatible water scarcity should capture three key elements: (i) a reflection of aridity or drought potential, (ii) quantification of all the components of water resource available to a given crop at a given locality and time, and (iii) use of crop- and catchment-specific water scarcity factors to evaluate the effect of crop production and virtual water on water scarcity. In this paper, we show the <b>conceptual</b> <b>outlines</b> for the proposed agri-compatible connections. Achieving agri-compatible connections among water scarcity, virtual water and food security will enhance the analysis and understanding of the role of virtual water for food security in the importing economy and water scarcity in the exporting economy. We suggest that achieving agri-compatibility will improve the use of virtual water as a mechanism to reduce existing and future pressures on global food securit...|$|E

Today a large amount of software development models exist but not many of them treat maintenance {{as a part of the}} software life cycle. In most cases maintenance is depicted as an activity towards the end of the software life cycle. The high cost ascribed to software maintenance motivates for improvements. The maintenance concept TQMain proposed in this thesis distinguishes from other maintenance concepts by its use of preventive, predictive and proactive maintenance strategies. TQMain uses a common database to store real-time data from various departments and uses it for analyse and assessment to track the development of deviations in the condition of the production process and product quality at an early stage. A continuous cyclic improvement of the maintenance strategy is reached by comparing the data from the real-time measurements with data from the database. The ISO/IEC Software engineering – Product qualities is used as a source of empiric data to conclude that the correct quality characteristics are used for identifying software product quality and its characteristics and compare them with the characteristics of industrial product quality. The results presented are that in the <b>conceptual</b> <b>outline</b> of TQMain measures are obviously not the same as in software maintenance, but the aspect of product quality is common for both. The continuous cyclic improvement of the product quality that TQMain features together with the aspect of detecting potential failures before they occur would, judging from the <b>conceptual</b> <b>outline</b> of TQMain be applicable on software maintenance...|$|R

Unfortunately, such a reconstruction has been elusive at best. The Apocalypse’s internal complexity and maze of symbols have rendered definitive statements and schematics all but useless.

40|$|After {{more than}} three years in orbit, a {{longitude}} swap maneuver was required to exchange the leading and trailing spacecraft of the GRACE formation. While the two satellites are nominally separated by about 220 km in along-track direction, a close encounter took place during the swap sequence. Based on the successful use for co-location of geo-stationary satellites, the concept of eccentricity/inclination vector separation has been suggested for safe proximity operations in this mission phase. Taking care of the natural evolution of the relative orbital elements of GRACE 1 and 2, optimum maneuver dates were identified. By proper timing of the maneuvers a safe limit for the minimum distance during the encounter could be guaranteed even in case of arbitrary thruster performance errors. This allowed the use of a fuel optimal maneuver sequence with individual drift start and stop maneuvers.
