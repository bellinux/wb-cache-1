25|$|Green's 2000 book, , {{had a deep}} {{impact in}} the {{academic}} history community. The book is a semi-autobiographical account of the role historical awareness plays in forging powerful, effective social movements.

The Doctor identifies the creatures as Dream Crabs – aliens that induce pleasant, euphoric dreams on their intended victims as a distraction whilst the crabs devour their brains. During this time, both the Doctor and Clara reveal that they had lied to each other during their last meeting: Clara lied about her dead boyfriend, Danny Pink, having returned from the Nethersphere, while the Doctor falsely claimed to have found Gallifrey.
