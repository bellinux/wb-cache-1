40|$|Global {{competition}} is forcing corporations {{to confront the}} weaknesses of inflexible mass production lines to enhance their profitability. New technological solutions are now required to overcome the problems of manufacturing customized items, and competitiveness means quick response to new demand, short cycle times, and on-time delivery in the diverse manufacturing environments. Flow shops and job shops are typical manufacturing environments, and in many cases, a manufacturing facility is a hybrid shop with significant interactions between these two. To address the above important goals, the newly evolving manufacturing systems are likely to require sophisticated <b>computer</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>production</b> management, where production scheduling plays an extremely important role and significantly affects the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s profitability. ^ The dissertation is to advance scheduling theory and its applications with emphasizing on permutation flow shops, job shops with transfer lots, and <b>integrated</b> order and <b>production</b> scheduling. The common characteristics of these environments are their focus on manufacturing a high variety of products, while coping with variable demand for each product. The objective is to meet demand {{in a timely fashion}} with low work-in-process and finished goods inventory, subject to relevant constraints including resource capacity, operation precedence, and processing times. ^ This dissertation presents novel 2 ̆ 2 separable 2 ̆ 2 integer programming formulations for permutation flow shops, job shops with transfer lots, and the <b>integrated</b> order and <b>production</b> scheduling. The problems are solved under the Lagrangian relaxation framework. Lagrange multipliers are used to relax coupling constraints, and the relaxed problems are decomposed into relevant subproblems which can be solved by using dynamic programming method, or directly. The multipliers are updated at the high level by using the recently developed Reduced Complexity Bundle Method. Numerical testing results show that the operation waiting times are substantially reduced by using lot splitting techniques, and the product deliveries and machine utilizations are significantly improved. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we show {{how we have}} applied, in a current project, mobile agent {{technology}} to an industrial process {{in the field of}} textile manufacturing. The project involves several companies, each of which is a Europe-wide representative of one of the key phases of the textile production process (e. g. spinning, weaving, dyeing, finishing and ready made clothing). The main contribution of this paper is the description of the agent-oriented application framework which integrates their business enterprise information systems, to create a supply and distribution chain in the volatile (seasonal) environment of top fashion men's and women's wool garment manufacturing.

40|$|The {{integration}} {{of information technology}} into industrial development and manufacturing is a worldwide phenomenon, the technical and economic effects of which are of great importance for the continued development in this area in {{all corners of the}} globe. Functional hardware and software components with <b>integrated</b> <b>production</b> facilities are already available, improved hardware and software (databases, networks) allow existing separate solutions to be linked together. CIM is, however, not an organizational and technological advance which can be achieved overnight. Once initial developments have been completed they must be integrated and partly updated. For a successful CIM installation, therefore, a modular concept, specific to the firm in question must be developed. The aim of the "Fabrik 2000 " CIM demonstration (Factory 2000) by the Fraunhofer-Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and Automation (IPA) is, therefore, to demonstrate practical and concrete solutions of <b>computer</b> <b>integrate</b> d manufacture and its advantages especially for the potential users in medium-sized firms, on order to enable the intorduction and application of <b>computer</b> <b>integrated</b> manufacturing. On the basis of a demonstration manufacturing plant with a continuous production process, CIM demonstrations, seminars and training programmes and conversion support are to be carried out. With the help of the installed and deliberately heterogeneous manufacturing and computer systems, various solutions for closed CIM chains, from the design through manufacture and assembly up to quality assurance must be implemented, in order to enable a general representation of the individual subareas of 'computer integrated manufacture'...|$|R
