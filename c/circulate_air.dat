25|$|Viticulture in Washington State {{is deeply}} {{influenced}} {{by the use of}} irrigation and the water rights associated with suitable vineyard land. Sourced from the major rivers that run through the area, most vineyards in Eastern Washington are irrigated though some vineyards (especially in the slightly wetter Walla Walla Valley near the Blue Mountains), but some have begun experimenting with dry farming. The ever-present threat of severe winter frost has influenced viticultural practices including the adoption of wind turbines to churn and <b>circulate</b> <b>air</b> in the vineyard. In the late 20th century, many producers began adapting Russian vine-training techniques for fan-training which promotes better air circulation among the vine so cold air doesn't settle on the vine. Due to the minimal risk exposure to phylloxera, some producers have opted to leave their vines ungrafted on its original rootstock since an exposed graft union is more vulnerable to frost damage. One benefit of the traditionally cold winters is that the grapevines are allowed to go into full dormancy, which allows the vines to shut down and conserve energy that will be vital {{at the beginning of the}} new growth cycle for the vine. The threat of freezing condition is the main viticultural hazard that vine growers need to concern themselves with since the lack of rainfall during the summer and autumn contribute to the dry, arid conditions that allows most of Washington vineyards to be relatively disease free.|$|E
500|$|Alyeska {{reported}} {{that about half}} were too minor to affect {{the running of the}} pipeline, but questions lay with more than a thousand welds that might be dangerous. Re-examining the welds would be extremely difficult, since those sections of pipeline were sealed (and in many cases buried). By July, the U.S. Congress began holding hearings into the welding problems. President Gerald Ford sent a team to Alaska to oversee and examine Alyeska's work. At the recommendations of this team and to avoid further investigations, Alyeska began repairing the welds on its own. By September, more than 3,000 of the questionable welds had been redone or certified as safe. Alyeska asked for waivers on the remaining 612 welds, and more hearings resulted. By the end of November, only 34 welds were still at issue. The leader of Ford's team ordered 31 of the welds to be dug up and re-done. Waivers were granted for only three welds, all of which were buried [...] under the Koyukuk River south of the Brooks Range. Proof of the integrity of questionable welds were evaluated by a unique solution in Section Five north of the Brooks Range. [...] On either side of the Sagavanirktok River, the above ground pipeline was cut upon and 48 inch fans installed to <b>circulate</b> <b>air.</b> [...] Then a team of 12 men and inspectors riding on wheeled sleds pulled by a modified John Deere lawnmower entered the pipe. [...] Welds were counted during the passage. [...] After arriving at the questionable weld under the Sagavanirktok River, an ultrasound was taken {{on the inside of the}} pipe. [...] Then the team exited the pipe on the opposite side and the ultrasound was taken back to camp for evaluation. [...] Alyeska estimated the total cost of redoing the welds to be $55 million.|$|E

[...] The steel body of the Bathysphere was as strong as ever, but the quartz windows had developed minute fractures which would prevent them from withstanding the pressure of the deep sea, and one of the copper bolts for the hatch was found to be damaged due to the explosive decompression after the failed test dive in 1932. [...] In addition to replacing these parts of the Bathysphere, Beebe also had it installed with a new system of valves which could regulate the release of oxygen much more precisely than before, and a barometer to show the increase in pressure if oxygen was flowing too quickly. [...] The palm-leaf fans to <b>circulate</b> <b>air</b> past the chemical trays were replaced with a small electric fan, powered by the same cable that powered the searchlight, and the searchlight itself was replaced with a far more powerful one.|$|E

2500|$|Leaving the hive, {{foraging}} bees collect sugar-rich flower nectar {{and return}} to the hive where they use their [...] "honey stomachs" [...] to ingest and regurgitate the nectar repeatedly until it is partially digested. Bee digestive enzymes – invertase, amylase, and diastase – along with gastric acid hydrolyze sucrose to a mixture of glucose and fructose. The bees work together as a group with the regurgitation and digestion for as long as 20 minutes until the product reaches storage quality. It is then placed in honeycomb cells left unsealed while still high in water content (about 20%) and natural yeasts, which, unchecked, would cause the sugars in the newly formed honey to ferment. The process continues as hive bees flutter their wings constantly to <b>circulate</b> <b>air</b> and evaporate water from the honey to a content around 18%, raising the sugar concentration, and preventing fermentation. The bees then cap the cells with wax to seal them. As removed from the hive by a beekeeper, honey has a long shelf life and will not ferment if properly sealed.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{environmental}} concerns, the supply {{and use of}} natural gravel has been limited by the Swedish government. The Swedish concrete industry is therefore examining manufactured sand as an alternative that has equal or better product quality, and which the Swedish quarry industry already {{has the ability to}} deliver. However, in order to comply with the specifi cations set by the concrete industry, a better means of classifi cation is needed, as the proportion of fi ne particles (fi ller) smaller than 63 - 125 μm in size must be reduced. One classifi cation technology that meets the requirements may be air classifi cation. This paper examines the process of <b>circulating</b> <b>air</b> classifi cation, which is not yet commonly used in the Swedish quarry industry; suggesting that {{a better understanding of the}} process is needed. The <b>circulating</b> <b>air</b> classifi er in this study has two internal machine parameters that can affect the separation point; namely, the speeds of the circulating fan and the separator fan. We study their effect on the separation point as well as the interaction between these parameters. Full-scale parameter tests are also conducted, in which size distribution is measured before and after the <b>circulating</b> <b>air</b> classifi cation. This study shows how the different parameters affect the separation point and that it is possible to produce manufactured sand according to specifi cations.
