5|$|After {{this the}} brigade {{continued}} to advance, moving through Ruddenburg and Greven before carrying out {{an attack on}} Osnabruck on 4 April 1945. On the night of 7/8 April they crossed the Weser River in assault boats and under the <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> <b>darkness</b> carried out a flanking manoeuvre on the Germans occupying the town of Leese, catching them by surprise.|$|E
5|$|The 21st did {{not reach}} the stone wall on Marye's Heights but took shelter in a very slight {{depression}} in the terrain, remaining pinned in that position until night. Under the <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> <b>darkness,</b> the regiment retired, only to be ordered to the same spot the next morning, expecting a Confederate counterattack which never came.

Regarding the cover-art for The River, [...] "... {{the back cover}} was [...] "not thought out" [...] — given not only Springsteen's penchant for overthinking, but also the thematic ties of Frank Stefanko's store window image, including its depiction of bride(s) and groom, and the first use of the American flag on a Springsteen album." ...|$|R

During this time the Ottoman Army was able to withdraw in good order; the rearguard garrisons retiring under <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> <b>darkness</b> during the night of 8/9 November 1917.|$|E
5|$|At 23:00 on 30 March, with {{a strong}} wind from the south, Guillaume Tell sailed from Valletta, Decrés hoping to use the <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> <b>darkness</b> to escape the British blockade. Dixon had {{deployed}} his ships around the island, with Valletta watched by the frigate HMS Penelope under Captain Henry Blackwood. At 23:55, Blackwood's lookouts spotted Guillaume Tell and the captain gave chase, ordering the brig HMS Minorca under Commander George Miller to convey the message to Dixon, whose ships were just visible in the distance. Blackwood also attempted to signal his discovery to his commanding officer as Penelope gave chase.|$|E
5|$|On 22 April 2012, Chen {{escaped from}} house arrest. Chen's fellow activist Hu Jia stated that Chen had been {{planning}} escape for a long time, and had previously attempted to dig a tunnel for escape. In {{the weeks leading up}} to his escape, Chen gave his guards the impression that he was ill in bed, and stopped appearing outside the house, which allowed him several days before any absence would be discovered. Under <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> <b>darkness</b> and with the help of his wife, Chen climbed over the wall around his house, breaking his foot in the process.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} October 1988, {{in and around}} Los Angeles, California. Shortly {{before the beginning of}} location shooting, Hollywood union truck drivers or teamsters went on strike to protest pay cuts and overtime changes. With deadlines looming, the production searched for non-union drivers, aware that the Teamsters might retaliate by sabotaging equipment or flying airplanes above the filming to ruin audio recordings. After one of the production's camera trucks exploded in the studio parking lot, the non-union drivers headed to Yosemite National Park under <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> <b>darkness</b> with a police escort.|$|E
5|$|A Japanese convoy {{approaching}} Endau {{was detected}} by reconnaissance aircraft on 26 January and was ineffectually attacked multiple times by Allied aircraft as it was landing its troops. The Allies suffered heavy casualties, while the Japanese lost only a single aircraft. The Royal Navy committed two destroyers later that day {{to break up the}} Japanese landings, despite the much larger Japanese escort force. Sailing under the <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> <b>darkness,</b> they were able to locate the convoy anchored there without being detected, but could not find the troopships in the darkness. The ships attempted to disengage, but were fired upon by the convoy's escorts and one destroyer was sunk {{in the early morning hours}} of 27 January.|$|E
5|$|According to Hayes' confession, {{the two men}} {{had planned}} to rob the Petit house under <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> <b>darkness</b> leaving the family bound, but unharmed. Hayes {{attributed}} the outcome to a change of plan. Upon their arrival {{in the early hours of}} July 23, they found William Petit sleeping on a couch on the porch. Komisarjevsky struck William on the head with a baseball bat found in the yard and then tied him up at gunpoint in the basement. The children and their mother were then bound and locked in their respective rooms. Hayes said that he and Komisarjevsky were not satisfied with their haul, and that a bankbook was found which showed an available balance.|$|E

60|$|Of all bad deeds that, under <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> the <b>darkness,</b> {{had been}} {{committed}} within wide London's bounds since night hung over it, that was the worst. Of all the horrors that rose with an ill scent upon the morning air, that was the foulest and most cruel.|$|R
5|$|Attempting {{to escape}} under <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> <b>darkness</b> on 14 April, the French {{squadron}} was spotted {{by a number}} of small British ships stationed close inshore. These ships raised the alarm and the main British squadron followed in pursuit. The rearmost French ship of the line, Hautpoult, was closely followed by the small brig HMS Recruit, which succeeded in delaying Hautpoult long enough that the main British squadron was able to attack and overwhelm her in a running battle that lasted three days and ended off the coast of Puerto Rico. The British suffered 45 casualties, the French nearly 100. The remainder of the French squadron escaped, with the two surviving ships of the line sailing directly for France, eventually reaching Cherbourg in May.|$|E
5|$|Burgoyne lost 1,000 {{men in the}} two battles, {{leaving him}} outnumbered by roughly 3 to 1; American losses came to about 500 killed and wounded. Burgoyne had also lost several of his most {{effective}} leaders, his attempts to capture the American position had failed, and his forward line was now breached. That night he lit fires at his remaining forward positions and withdrew under the <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> <b>darkness.</b> On the morning of October 8, {{he was back in}} the fortified positions he had held on September 16. By October 13 he was surrounded at Saratoga, and on October 17 he surrendered his army. The remnants of his expedition retreated from Ticonderoga back to Quebec.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} hours of 1 May, Krebs talked to General Chuikov, {{commander}} of the Soviet 8th Guards Army, informing him of Hitler's death and a willingness to negotiate a citywide surrender. They could not agree on terms because of Soviet insistence on unconditional surrender and Krebs' claim that he lacked authorisation to agree to that. Goebbels was against surrender. In the afternoon, Goebbels and his wife killed their children and then themselves. Goebbels's death removed the last impediment which prevented Weidling from accepting the terms of unconditional surrender of his garrison, but he chose to delay the surrender until the next morning to allow the planned breakout to take place under the <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> <b>darkness.</b>|$|E
50|$|In late 1975, Wingate {{moved to}} Columbia Records as Product Manager, and {{quickly became the}} manager of choice for their most prestigious and {{sensitive}} artists. During his tenure at Columbia, he product managed Springsteen's Darkness on the Edge of Town, Pink Floyd - Animals, David Gilmour's first solo LP, Nick Lowe - Pure Pop for Now People, Peter Tosh - Legalize It & Equal Rights albums and the three album initial marketing campaign for Elvis Costello's - My Aim is True, This Year's Model and Armed Forces.

5|$|During {{the spring}} of 1717, Stede Bonnet {{decided to become a}} pirate, despite having no {{knowledge}} of shipboard life. He contracted a local shipyard to build him a sixty-ton sloop, which he equipped with ten guns and named the Revenge. This was unusual, as most pirates seized their ships by mutiny or boarding, or else converted a privateer vessel to a pirate ship. Bonnet enlisted a crew of more than seventy men. He relied on his quartermaster and officer for their knowledge of sailing, and as a result, he was not highly respected by his crew. In another break from tradition, Bonnet paid his crew wages, not shares of plunder as most pirates did. Royal Navy intelligence reported that he departed Carlisle Bay, Barbados under <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> <b>darkness.</b>|$|E
5|$|Each side's {{front line}} was {{constantly}} under observation by snipers and lookouts during daylight; movement was therefore restricted {{until after the}} dusk stand-to and night had fallen. Under the <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> <b>darkness,</b> troops attended to vital maintenance and resupply, with rations and water being brought to the front line, fresh units swapped places with troops moving to the rear for rest and recuperation. Trench raiding was also carried out and construction parties formed to repair trenches and fortifications, while wiring parties were sent out to repair or renew the barbed wire in no man's land. An hour before dawn, everyone would stand-to once more.|$|E
5|$|From 1 to 7 November, strong Turkish rearguards at Tel el Khuweilfe in the {{southern}} Judean Hills, at Hareira and Sheria on the maritime plain and at Sausage Ridge and Gaza close to the Mediterranean coast, held the Egyptian Expeditionary Force in heavy fighting. During this time the Turkish Army was able to withdraw in good order. The rearguard garrisons themselves were also able to retire under <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> <b>darkness,</b> during the night of 6/7 or 7/8 November. On 7 and 8 November, the surviving units of the 7th and 8th Turkish armies further delayed the advance of Desert Mounted Corps commanded by Chauvel and the XXI Corps's 52nd (Lowland) Division and the 75th Yeomanry Division.|$|E
60|$|True for {{the moment}} the Englishman had dis{{appeared}}. Burden and all, the gloom appeared to have swallowed him up.

5|$|In a {{nighttime}} raid, under the <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> <b>darkness</b> and a distraction by a P-61 Black Widow, the group surprised the Japanese forces {{in and around}} the camp. Hundreds of Japanese troops were killed in the 30-minute coordinated attack; the Americans suffered minimal casualties. The Rangers, Scouts, and guerrillas escorted the POWs back to American lines. The rescue allowed the prisoners to tell of the death march and prison camp atrocities, which sparked a new rush of resolve for the war against Japan. The rescuers were awarded commendations by MacArthur, and were also recognized by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. A memorial now sits {{on the site of the}} former camp, and the events of the raid have been depicted in several films.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1528, Montejo left Conil {{for the city of}} Chauaca, which was {{abandoned}} by its Maya inhabitants under <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> <b>darkness.</b> The following morning the inhabitants attacked the Spanish party but were defeated. The Spanish then continued to Ake, where they engaged in a major battle, which left more than 1,200 Maya dead. After this Spanish victory, the neighbouring Maya leaders all surrendered. Montejo's party then continued to Sisia and Loche before heading back to Xelha. Montejo arrived at Xelha with only 60 of his party, and found that only 12 of his 40-strong garrison survived, while the entire garrison at Pole had been slaughtered.|$|E
5|$|Just as they {{finished}} their report, the detachment was fired on by Ustaše Militia. The Ustaše called {{for help from}} Sinj, and by 18:00, Italian reinforcements had arrived and began encircling the detachment, engaging them with mortars and light artillery. Outnumbered and facing an enemy with greater firepower, the Partisans planned to hold their positions until evening then retreat using the <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> <b>darkness.</b> About 20:00, Kovačević-Lala, {{one of the most}} experienced members of the detachment, was killed after being hit by a mortar round, which had a significant effect on the morale of the remaining fighters. Borovčić-Kurir issued the order to retreat, but it turned into chaos as individuals fled the area.|$|E
60|$|But as yet Barnet {{had seen}} {{no more than}} the mildest {{beginnings}} of modern warfare. So far he had taken part only in a little shooting.

60|$|And whilst {{they waited}} thus, under <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> the <b>darkness</b> {{and as the}} tide began to ebb, Captain Blood's fleet weighed anchor quietly; and, as once before, with no more canvas spread than that which their sprits could carry, so as to give them {{steering}} way--and even these having been painted black--the four vessels, without a light showing, groped their way by soundings to the channel which led to that narrow passage out to sea.|$|R
