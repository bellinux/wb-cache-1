50|$|The Interceptor had one endemic engine {{issue in}} the V4, {{camshaft}} wear. In 1984, camshaft issues started to arise and owners started to complain. At first Honda did not admit {{that there was a}} problem but after conducting further research, they decided that the camshaft wear was most likely caused by oil flow issues. Valve clearance issues were also suggested as a possible contributory factor. Honda issued a recall on the bikes and added kink-free oil lines and less restrictive banjo bolts. They also made alterations by drilling holes in the cam lobes and capping off the hollow <b>cam's</b> <b>ends.</b> This did not fix the problem, so Honda went back to the drawing board. The first thought was that the issue was heat related, but after further investigation the real problem was discovered - there was too much clearance in the camshaft bearings. Honda fixed this by changing all the camshafts with new components. This fixed the camshaft issues but the reputation of the Honda V4 was already damaged.|$|R

50|$|The <b>cams</b> at the <b>end</b> of each lever on {{the female}} end align with a {{circumferential}} groove on the male end. When the levers are rotated to the locked position, they pull the male end into the female socket, creating a tight seal {{up against a}} gasket. The arms lock into position using an over-center arrangement, preventing accidental decoupling. Because the groove is cut {{all the way around}} the male end, there is no specific alignment necessary to couple as there would be with threaded connectors, and there is no opportunity for cross-threading. This results in an error-resistant, faster coupling operation. Because the compression between the two fittings is limited by the size of the <b>cams</b> on the <b>end</b> of the levers and the rotation of the levers themselves, there is also no possibility of over- or under-tightening the fitting; the pressure against the sealing gasket is effectively constant from one coupling operation to the next, reducing possibility of leaks.|$|R
50|$|Some pulley systems use {{a single}} cam {{at the bottom}} of the bow and a {{balanced}} wheel at the top of the bow instead of two identical cams. This design eliminates the need for buss cables and instead uses a single string that begins at the cam on the bottom of the bow, travels over the wheel on top, around the bottom <b>cam</b> again, and <b>ends</b> attaching to the top limb.|$|R
50|$|On August 27, the AKO Fratmen {{played in}} the National Championship Game against the Oakville Buzz. The Fratmen and Buzz were tied 1-1 after the first period. The second saw the Buzz come alive, at the end leading by a score of 5-2. In the third, the Buzz blew the game wide open. The final score was 10-4, but the Fratmen held tough until the <b>end.</b> <b>Cam</b> Brown was named the Fratmen's Game MVP, while both Jamie Pillon and Matt Soulliere were named to the Founders Cup All-Star Team.|$|R
40|$|Analytical {{methods to}} enable the {{evaluation}} of important lubrication operational parameters at the contact between any cam and follower mechanism (excluding valve trains incorporating rolling element followers or hydraulic lash adjusters) have been collated, critically assessed and developed. A robust and user friendly computer program, which incorporated these methods, was written in order that the tribological conditions existing at the cam/follower interface of any type of valve train in common use in today's internal combustion engines could be studied. The output from the program included graphical displays of frictional torque, minimum lubricant film thickness and Hertzian stress around the cam cycle. Such studies were performed on a cam and flat faced follower system, a cam and centrally pivoted follower system, a <b>cam</b> and <b>end</b> pivoted follower system and a desmodromic system (comprising a conventional cam and centrally pivoted. system and a desmodromic <b>cam</b> and <b>end</b> pivoted follower system). The computer program also allowed parametric studies {{to be carried out}} on valve train mechanisms. Parametric studies of three different valve trains, including the valve trains from the Rover 2300 and the Ford 2. 0 litre Pinto engines, have been presented, the results being presented in graphical and tabular form. The loadings, orbits, and power losses associated with the camshaft bearings of the Ford 2. 0 litre Pinto engine were evaluated using existing dynamically loaded bearing analysis techniques. The total frictional power loss predicted for the three camshaft bearings was found to be equal to approximately one fifth of that calculated for all of the cam/follower interfaces throughout the operational speed range of the engine. An experimental single valve desmodromic valve train apparatus was designed and commissioned to test the accuracy of the valve train lubrication analysis computer program. The apparatus allowed studies to be made of the running-in of valve trains operating at lubricant temperatures of 40 C, 60 C and. 80 C, by applying the electrical resistivity technique. Analytical models used to predict which cam/follower pair was in control of the valve at any point around the cam cycle were tested using an electrical continuity technique and were found to show good agreement with practice. Good agreement was also found between the theoretically predicted and measured torque and power required to drive the valve train. ...|$|R

40|$|A simple, yet useful {{approach}} to the geometry design and machining of globoidal index cams and roller-follower turrets is developed. From the machining {{point of view of}} the globoidal <b>cam</b> by an <b>end</b> mill, the side surface geometry can be easily defined as the swept surface by the tool path. By using the analytical cam surface formulation, the pressure angle, the contact forces, and the torques between the cam and the turret can be investigated.

To demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the procedure, two numerical examples of the globoidal index cams are presented along with the 3 D computer printouts and the photography of machined samples...|$|R
50|$|A TV {{adaptation}} of the book {{was made by the}} BBC. There have so far been five series of the TV programme, which mainly airs on CBBC, starring Dani Harmer in the role of Tracy Beaker. Montanna Thompson plays Justine Littlewood, Tracy's worst enemy, and Nisha Nayar plays her social worker, Elaine 'the pain' Boyak. There are many characters in the TV adaptation that do not feature in the book itself. The TV adaptation has several series, and towards the end, some episodes do not feature Tracy. The TV programmes expand on the lives of the children's daily affairs, whereas the book <b>ends</b> with <b>Cam</b> fostering Tracy and her living happily ever after. In the TV programme, Tracy has disagreements with <b>Cam</b> and <b>ends</b> up back in the children's home but maintains a strong relationship with Cam. Cam gets married to Gary {{at the end of the}} series, and the last we see of Tracy is when she is talking to Justine on the steps of the children's home, after being told she will be adopted by them. Having heard this, Justine decides to give living with her dad another go.|$|R
40|$|The {{entry of}} calcium into {{dendritic}} spines can trigger {{a sequence of}} biochemical reactions that begins with the activation of calmodulin (<b>CaM)</b> and <b>ends</b> with long-term changes to synaptic strengths. The degree of activation of CaM can depend on highly local elevations in the concentration of calcium and the duration of transient increases in calcium concentration. Accurate measurement of these local changes in calcium is difficult because the spaces are so small and the numbers of molecules are so low. We have therefore developed a Monte Carlo model of intracellular calcium dynamics within the spine that included calcium binding proteins, calcium transporters and ion channels activated by voltage and glutamate binding. The model reproduced optical recordings using calcium indicator dyes and showed that without the dye the free intracellular calcium concentration transient was much higher than predicted from the fluorescent signal. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials induced large, long-lasting calcium gradients across the postsynaptic density, which activated CaM. When glutamate was released at the synapse 10 ms before an action potential occurred, simulating activity patterns that strengthen hippocampal synapses, the calcium gradient and activation of CaM in the postsynaptic density were much greater than when the order was reversed, a condition that decreases synaptic strengths, suggesting a possible mechanism underlying the induction of long-term changes in synaptic strength. The spatial and temporal mechanisms for selectivity i...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This {{qualitative}} study examines the meanings that African Canadians living in Nova Scotia, Canada, ascribe to {{their experiences with}} cancer, family caregiving, and their use of complementary and alternative medicine (<b>CAM)</b> at <b>end</b> of life. Design: Case study methodology using in-depth interviews were {{used to examine the}} experiences of caregivers of decedents who died from cancer in three families. Findings: For many African Canadians end of life is characterized by care provided by family and friends in the home setting, community involvement, a focus on spirituality, and an avoidance of institutionalized health services. Caregivers and their families experience multiple challenges (and multiple demands). There is evidence to suggest that the use of CAM and home remedies at end of life are common. Discussion: The delivery of palliative care to African Canadian families should consider and support their preference to provide end-of-life care in the home setting. Keywords African Canadians, end of life, complementary and alternative medicine Qualitative case study methodology was used to explore the experiences and recollections of primary caregivers and sec-ondary caregivers (e. g., other family members, neighbors, clergy, etc.) of decedents who died from cancer in three African Canadian families in Nova Scotia, Canada. 1 This research also explored whether participants used complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and home remedies to ameliorate symptoms at end of life. Specifically, the objective of this inquiry was to examine the meanings that African Canadians ascribe to their cancer and end-of-life experiences. We also examine the use of home remedies and complementary and alternative healing practices at end of life.

40|$|Forecasts of {{southeast}} Pacific stratocumulus at 208 S and 858 W during the East Pacific Investigation of Climate (EPIC) cruise of October 2001 are examined with the ECMWF model, the Atmospheric Model (AM) from GFDL, the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) from NCAR, and the CAM with a revised atmospheric boundary layer formulation from the University of Washington (CAM-UW). The forecasts are initialized from ECMWF analyses and each model is run for 3 – 5 days {{to determine the}} differences with the EPIC field observations. Observations during the EPIC cruise show a well-mixed boundary layer under a sharp inversion. The inversion height and the cloud layer have a strong and regular diurnal cycle. A key problem common to the models is that the planetary boundary layer (PBL) depth is too shallow when compared to EPIC observations. However, {{it is suggested that}} improved PBL depths are achieved with more physically realistic PBL schemes: at one <b>end,</b> <b>CAM</b> uses a dry and surface-driven PBL scheme and produces a very shallow PBL, while the ECWMF model uses an eddy-diffusivity/mass-flux approach and produces a deeper and bettermixed PBL. All the models produce a strong diurnal cycle in the liquid water path (LWP), but there are large differences in the amplitude and phase when compared to the EPIC observations. This, in turn, affects the radiative fluxes at the surface and the surface energy budget. This is particularly relevant for coupled simulations as this can lead to a large SST bias. 1...|$|R

Defensive <b>end</b> <b>Cam</b> Thomas {{recovered}} the ball and ended up losing it while being tackled, then defensive back William Gay {{picked it up and}} returned it for a touchdown. However, replays showed that Thomas was down by contact before he lost the fumble, and a 15-yard penalty against Gay for excessive celebration moved the ball {{all the way back to}} Pittsburghs 36-yard line. Receiver Martavis Bryants 44-yard run on an end-around play then set up Boswells 34-yard field goal that gave the Steelers a 9-0 lead. Following a punt, Roethlisberger completed a 60-yard pass to Brown on the Bengals 10-yard line. Then he threw a pass in the back of the end zone to Bryant, who made a diving somersault catch and maintained possession for a touchdown by pinning the ball against one leg while falling to the ground.

5000|$|Owen is {{a lonely}} and bored kid who {{just moved to}} the Finger Lakes of upstate New York with his father who is a workaholic. His mother {{recently}} died, and {{he is trying to}} find something to do with his summer since he does not live in a neighborhood like he used to when he lived in Buffalo. One day, while he is running up and down a seven-mile trail that he found with his Pointer, Josie. His mother used {{to talk to him about}} life on other planets, which he wonders about often. When he gets by the creek, he finds a piece of cloth with blood on it. He follows a trail of footsteps, dirt, and blood to an abandoned house where he meets a girl named Campion, (named after a flower) with very shiny green eyes who claims she is from another planet. Cam explains her parents landed and she got left behind by mistake. She explains the blood from a wound she got because of a hubcap that was thrown at her by Ray, the boyfriend of Bobbie, the woman who found her. She explains that Ray and Bobbi are pursuing her because she escaped from a hotel room they kept her in. Cam says she likes Tootsie Rolls, and agrees life on Earth really has its points. Owen kindly brings her food, water, and supplies. Owen tries to keep Cam a secret from his father, and from the [...] "Dog People", a friendly family who has over 19 pets whom they walk down the trail daily. (The Dog People, Ernie and Charlene, explain that they wanted kids, but they never got them. So, they had to adopt dogs and cats.) Cam then says she needs him to make a [...] "signal" [...] in a wheat field to signal her parents so they can pick her up. Cam tells Owen that he needs to hide her for exactly four days, which is when a full moon comes, and they search during full moons. But, since they have become good friends, Cam asks Owen to come with her, and leave his boring life for her planet. Cam and Owen camp out in a tent and talk about her home planet. Cam explains her planet was once ravaged with war, and they have evolved into smarter beings. She then explains they [...] "like dogs" [...] and says Josie can come. Owen starts talking to his father and gets excited when he leaves a note saying he will come home early so they can talk again. However, his dad is working on a big audit, and does not make it. Towards ten o'clock, Owen cries himself to sleep. Angry, Owen gets up early the next morning and plows the signal into a wheat field with a board. Owen tells Cam he will be coming with her to her planet. They anxiously wait for the ship to arrive until Ray shows up and attacks them. While Ray is injuring Owen, Cam knocks him unconscious with the board they used to plow the field. Cam frantically shouts to the sky when she sees lights.
