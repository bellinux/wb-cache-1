5|$|The English chemist Charles Hatchett {{reported}} a new element similar to tantalum in 1801 and named it <b>columbium.</b> In 1809, the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston wrongly concluded that tantalum and <b>columbium</b> were identical. The German chemist Heinrich Rose determined in 1846 that tantalum ores contain a second element, which he named niobium. In 1864 and 1865, {{a series of}} scientific findings clarified that niobium and <b>columbium</b> were the same element (as distinguished from tantalum), and for a century both names were used interchangeably. Niobium was officially adopted as {{the name of the}} element in 1949, but the name <b>columbium</b> remains in current use in metallurgy in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Niobium was {{identified}} by English chemist Charles Hatchett in 1801. He {{found a new}} element in a mineral sample that {{had been sent to}} England from Connecticut, United States in 1734 by John Winthrop F.R.S. (grandson of John Winthrop the Younger) and named the mineral columbite and the new element <b>columbium</b> after Columbia, the poetical name for the United States. The <b>columbium</b> discovered by Hatchett was probably a mixture of the new element with tantalum.|$|E
5|$|Niobium, {{formerly}} <b>columbium,</b> is {{a chemical}} element with symbol Nb (formerly Cb) and atomic number 41. It is a soft, grey, ductile transition metal, {{often found in}} the minerals pyrochlore (the main commercial source for niobium) and columbite. Its name comes from Greek mythology, specifically Niobe, who {{was the daughter of}} Tantalus, the namesake of tantalum. The name reflects the great similarity between the two elements in their physical and chemical properties, making them difficult to distinguish.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, {{there was}} {{considerable}} confusion over the difference between <b>columbium</b> (niobium) and the closely related tantalum. In 1809, English chemist William Hyde Wollaston compared the oxides derived from both columbium—columbite, with a density 5.918g/cm3, and tantalum—tantalite, with a density over 8g/cm3, {{and concluded that the}} two oxides, despite the significant difference in density, were identical; thus he kept the name tantalum. This conclusion was disputed in 1846 by German chemist Heinrich Rose, who argued that there were two different elements in the tantalite sample, and named them after children of Tantalus: niobium (from Niobe) and pelopium (from Pelops). This confusion arose from the minimal observed differences between tantalum and niobium. The claimed new elements pelopium, ilmenium, and dianium were in fact identical to niobium or mixtures of niobium and tantalum.|$|E
5|$|Tantalum is {{considered}} a conflict resource. Coltan, the industrial name for a columbite–tantalite mineral from which <b>columbium</b> (i.e. niobium) and tantalum are extracted, {{can also be found}} in Central Africa, which is why tantalum is being linked to warfare in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire). According to an October 23, 2003 United Nations report, the smuggling and exportation of coltan has helped fuel the war in the Congo, a crisis that has resulted in approximately 5.4 million deaths since 1998 – making it the world’s deadliest documented conflict since World War II. Ethical questions have been raised about responsible corporate behavior, human rights, and endangering wildlife, due to the exploitation of resources such as coltan in the armed conflict regions of the Congo Basin. However, although important for the local economy in Congo, the contribution of coltan mining in Congo to the world supply of tantalum is usually small. The United States Geological Survey reports in its yearbook that this region produced a little less than 1% of the world's tantalum output in 2002–2006, peaking at 10% in 2000 and 2008.|$|E
25|$|Coltan (short for columbitetantalite {{and known}} industrially as tantalite) is a dull black {{metallic}} ore {{from which the}} elements niobium and tantalum are extracted. The niobium-dominant mineral in coltan is columbite (after niobium's original American name, <b>columbium),</b> and the tantalum-dominant mineral is tantalite.|$|E
500|$|<b>Columbium</b> (symbol [...] "Cb") was {{the name}} {{originally}} bestowed by Hatchett upon his discovery of the metal in 1801. The name reflected that the type specimen of the ore came from America (Columbia). This name remained in use in American journals—the last paper published by American Chemical Society with <b>columbium</b> in its title dates from 1953—while niobium was used in Europe. To end this confusion, the name niobium was chosen for element 41 at the 15th Conference of the Union of Chemistry in Amsterdam in 1949. A year later this name was officially adopted by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) after 100 years of controversy, despite the chronological precedence of the name <b>columbium.</b> The latter name is still sometimes used in US industry. This was a compromise of sorts; the IUPAC accepted tungsten instead of wolfram in deference to North American usage; and niobium instead of <b>columbium</b> in deference to European usage. Not everyone agreed, and while many leading chemical societies and government organizations use the official IUPAC name, many leading metallurgists, metal societies, and the United States Geological Survey still use the original American name, [...] "columbium".|$|E
500|$|Tantalum was {{discovered}} in Sweden in 1802 by Anders Ekeberg. One year earlier, Charles Hatchett had discovered <b>columbium</b> (now niobium), and in 1809 the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston compared its oxide, columbite with a density of 5.918 g/cm3, to that of tantalum, tantalite with a density of 7.935 g/cm3. He concluded that the two oxides, despite their difference in measured density, were identical and kept the name tantalum. After Friedrich Wöhler confirmed these results, {{it was thought that}} <b>columbium</b> and tantalum were the same element. This conclusion was disputed in 1846 by the German chemist Heinrich Rose, who argued that there were two additional elements in the tantalite sample, and he named them after the children of Tantalus: niobium (from Niobe, the goddess of tears), and pelopium (from Pelops). The supposed element [...] "pelopium" [...] was later identified as a mixture of tantalum and niobium, and {{it was found that the}} niobium was identical to the <b>columbium</b> already discovered in 1801 by Hatchett.|$|E
500|$|The {{reactivity}} of niobium with oxygen requires {{it to be}} worked in a vacuum or inert atmosphere, which significantly increases the cost and difficulty of production. [...] Vacuum arc remelting (VAR) and electron beam melting (EBM), novel processes at the time, enabled the development of niobium and other reactive metals. [...] The project that yielded C-103 began in 1959 {{with as many as}} 256 experimental niobium alloys in the [...] "C-series" [...] (possibly from <b>columbium)</b> that could be melted as buttons and rolled into sheet. [...] Wah Chang had an inventory of hafnium, refined from nuclear-grade zirconium alloys, that it wanted to put to commercial use. [...] The 103rd experimental composition of the C-series alloys, Nb-10Hf-1Ti, had the best combination of formability and high-temperature properties. Wah Chang fabricated the first 500-lb heat of C-103 in 1961, ingot to sheet, using EBM and VAR. The intended applications included turbine engines and liquid metal heat exchangers. [...] Competing niobium alloys from that era included FS85 (Nb-10W-28Ta-1Zr) from Fansteel Metallurgical Corp., Cb129Y (Nb-10W-10Hf-0.2Y) from Wah Chang and Boeing, Cb752 (Nb-10W-2.5Zr) from Union Carbide, and Nb1Zr from Superior Tube Co.|$|E
