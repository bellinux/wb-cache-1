50|$|The {{high-resolution}} {{computed tomography}} (HRCT) <b>chest</b> <b>scan</b> {{is better than}} the chest radiograph to detect cystic parenchymal disease and is almost always abnormal at the time of diagnosis, even when the chest radiograph and pulmonary function assessments are normal. The typical CT shows diffuse round, bilateral, thin-walled cysts of varying sizes ranging from 1 to 45 mm in diameter. The numbers of cysts varies in LAM from a few to almost complete replacement of normal lung tissue. The profusion of cysts tends to be milder in patients with TSC-LAM than S-LAM, perhaps explained in part because TSC-LAM patients typically receive earlier screening. Pleural effusions are seen on CT in 12% of patients with S-LAM and 6% of patients with TSC-LAM. Other CT features include linear densities (29%), hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy (9%), pneumothorax, lymphangiomyoma, and thoracic duct dilation. Ground-glass opacities (12%) suggest the presence of interstitial edema due to lymphatic congestion. In patients with TSC, nodular densities on HRCT may represent multifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia (MMPH) made up of clusters of hyperplastic type II pneumocytes. MMPH may be present in males or females with TSC in {{the presence or absence of}} LAM, but not in patients with S-LAM. MMPH is not typically associated with physiologic or prognostic consequences, but one case of respiratory failure due to MMPH has been reported.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Aortic {{dissection}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} fatal vascular emergencies. Almost 40 % of the patients do not reach hospital in time while more than quarter die in the first 24 hours after the dissection begins. Case Report: A 37 -year old man was admitted to our hospital with severe anterior chest pain which had lasted for over a week. Suspected aortic dissection was rapidly confirmed using imaging modalities - MDCT <b>chest</b> <b>scan</b> and TTE, followed by an urgent surgical management - Bentall procedure. MDCT <b>chest</b> <b>scan</b> also discovered adrenal incidentaloma defined as malignant, pheochromocytoma like mass. Due to the critical state of the patient, there was not enough time for further endocrinologic testing. Discussion and conclusion: When treating patients with pheochromocytoma and acute aortic disection, it is crucial to obtain a stable hemodynamic state before the surgery, since they can trigger a severe hypertensive crisis due to high levels of cathecholamines induced chronic vasoconctriction. The most vulnerable periods are the induction of anesthesia and perioperative hemodynamic oscillations, so treating patients with short acting alpha- 1 adrenergic blocking agents preoperatively has proven to be helpful - Phentolamine. Both dissection of aorta and pheochromocytoma present challenges for anesthesiologists and early recognition of symptoms is essential in establishing the diagnosis and reducing the mortality rate...|$|E

40|$|Automatic {{segmentation}} {{of structures}} with missing or invisible borders is a challenging task. Since {{structures in the}} lungs are related, humans use contextual and shape information to infer the position of invisible borders. An example of a task in which the borders are often incomplete or invisible is the segmentation of the pulmonary lobes. In this paper, a fully automatic segmentation of the pulmonary lobes in <b>chest</b> CT <b>scans</b> is presented. The method is especially designed to be robust to incomplete fissures by incorporating contextual information from automatic lung, fissure, and bronchial tree segmentations, as well as shape information. Since the method relies on the result of automatic segmentations, {{it is important that}} the method is robust against failure of one or more of these segmentation methods. In an extensive experiment on 10 <b>chest</b> CT <b>scans</b> with manual segmentations, the robustness of the method to incomplete fissures and missing input segmentations is shown. In a second experiment on 100 <b>chest</b> CT <b>scans</b> with incomplete fissures, the method is shown to perform well. © 2009 Springer-Verlag...|$|R

The objective of our study is to evaluate long-term radiologic changes in untreated MAC lung disease by analyzing serial chest computed tomography (CT) scan findings. Of 104 patients with MAC lung disease, we selected 40 untreated nodular bronchiectatic MAC patients who underwent serial chest CTs without treatment {{for at least four}} years (mean = 6. 23 years). Majority of patients have minimal symptoms. Two chest radiologists retrospectively reviewed initial and final <b>chest</b> CT <b>scans.</b> Each <b>chest</b> CT <b>scan</b> was scored for presence and extent of bronchiectasis, cellular bronchiolitis, consolidation, cavity, and nodule (maximum score: 30). Of 40 patients, 39 (97. 5 %) experienced a significant increase in overall CT score (overall difference = 4. 89, p< 0. 001). On repeated measure analysis of variance analysis, cavity yielded the largest increase compared with cellular bronchiolitis (p = 0. 013), nodule (p< 0. 001), and consolidation (p = 0. 004).

40|$|Purpose—Lung cancer {{remains the}} leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Central to the lung-cancer {{diagnosis}} and staging process is the assessment of the central-chest lymph nodes. This assessment requires two steps: (1) examination of the lymph-node stations and identification of diagnostically important nodes in a three-dimensional (3 D) multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) chest scan; (2) tissue sampling of the identified nodes. We describe a computer-based system for automatically defining the central-chest lymph-node stations in a 3 D MDCT <b>chest</b> <b>scan.</b> Methods—Automated methods first construct a 3 D chest model, consisting of the airway tree, aorta, pulmonary artery, and other anatomical structures. Subsequent automated analysis then defines the 3 D regional nodal stations, as specified by the internationally standardized TNM lung-cancer staging system. This analysis involves extracting over 140 pertinent anatomical landmarks from structures contained in the 3 D chest model. Next, the physician uses data mining tools within the system to interactively select diagnostically important lymph nodes contained in the regional nodal stations...|$|E
