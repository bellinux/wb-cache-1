50|$|To receive cable {{television}} {{at a given}} location, cable distribution lines must be available on the local utility poles or underground utility lines. Coaxial cable brings the signal to the customer's building through a service drop, an overhead or underground cable. If the subscriber's building {{does not have a}} cable service drop, the cable company will install one. The standard cable used in the U.S. is RG-6, which has a 75 ohm impedance, and connects with a type F connector. The cable company's portion of the wiring usually ends at a distribution box on the building exterior, and built-in <b>cable</b> <b>wiring</b> in the walls usually distributes the signal to jacks in different rooms to which televisions are connected. Multiple cables to different rooms are split off the incoming cable with a small device called a splitter. There are two standards for {{cable television}}; older analog cable, and newer digital cable which can carry data signals used by digital television receivers such as HDTV equipment. All cable companies in the United States have switched to or are in the course of switching to digital cable television since it was first introduced in the late 1990s.|$|E
40|$|Background: Stainless steel wiring {{remains the}} most popular {{technique}} for primary sternal closure. Recently, a multifilament <b>cable</b> <b>wiring</b> system (Pioneer Surgical Technology Inc., Marquette, MI, USA) was introduced for sternal closure and has gained wide acceptance due to its superior resistance to tension. We aimed to compare conventional steel wiring to multifilament cable fixation for sternal closure in patients undergoing major cardiac surgery. Methods: Data were collected retrospectively on 1, 354 patients who underwent sternal closure after major cardiac surgery, using either the multifilament <b>cable</b> <b>wiring</b> system or conventional steel wires between January 2009 and October 2010. The surgical outcomes of these two groups of patients were compared using propensity score matching based on 18 baseline patient characteristics. Results: Propensity score matching yielded 392 pairs of patients {{in the two groups}} whose baseline profiles showed no significant differences. No {{significant differences between the two}} groups were observed in the rates of early mortality (2. 0...|$|E

Long secondary cable, large distribution area, complicated routes, large capacitance to ground, and serious interference and insulation problems bring about high fault probability in electrical secondary circuits, thus affecting the system reliability, in addition, the design, construction, debugging, maintenance, examination and repair, and reconstruction and expansion of the secondary circuit of traditional substations involve {{a large amount of}} work.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{capacitive}} {{device is}} a important {{equipment in the}} power system. Its working state is usually monitored by charged detection. However, the traditional detection method {{needs a lot of}} <b>cable</b> <b>wiring</b> for each test, which makes a big security hidden danger. In order to solve the problem, a new wireless measurement method based on 2. 4 G wireless and Bluetooth technology is proposed in this paper, which not only achieves wireless synchronous measurement of current and voltage, but also meets the requirements of capacitive equipment charged detection...|$|E
40|$|Indoor {{power line}} {{communication}} (PLC) systems experience high attenuation and frequency-selective channel condition, in addition to different types of colored noises. Its performance is heavily influenced by the length and topology of the in-house power <b>cable</b> <b>wiring.</b> By exploiting the broadcast property of the indoor power grid to each outlet, this paper presents a simple but practical relay-based cooperativecommunication scheme for indoor PLC networks. By plugging a relay device into a third outlet between the transmitter and receiver, reliable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be cooperatively achieved by setting proper system parameters. The condition for the optimal location of the plug-in relay device has been identified. Numerical simulation results show that {{with the cost of}} extra relay device, more reliable performance can be obtained with respect to the conventional direct transmission scheme...|$|E
30|$|The {{current and}} voltage signals on the {{secondary}} side of electromagnetic instrument transformers are {{transferred to the}} protection device through the secondary cable. Accordingly, the increase of the secondary equipment requires an increasing of secondary cable for connecting instrument transformer. The interlocking and blocking signals between secondary equipments, and the commands and signals between protection and circuit breaker are also transferred in one-to-one characteristics through secondary <b>cable</b> <b>wiring.</b> The relay protections and secondary circuits are configured according to bays. Each bay is naturally and physically independent, {{so that it is}} relatively easy to realize the isolation of faulty secondary equipment and circuits, hence the system will have relatively high reliability. On the other hand, it is relatively difficult to realize information intercommunication among all bays, repeated utilization of current and voltage quantities, interlocking and blocking information, as well as operation information. In order to realize the protection functions using multi-bay information, many secondary cables shall be added, thus the implementation is relatively difficult, which will restrict the functional improvement, optimization and supplementation of existing protection system.|$|E
