5|$|A 2001 {{proposal}} envisaged three routes, lines 1, 2 and 3. The {{first was}} a circular route around the northern suburbs, {{and the others were}} radial routes to Newbridge in the west and Newcraighall in the south.

5000|$|A void <b>contract</b> cannot <b>be</b> {{enforced}} by law. Void <b>contracts</b> <b>are</b> different from voidable <b>contracts,</b> which <b>are</b> <b>contracts</b> that may <b>be</b> (but not necessarily will be) nullified. However, when a <b>contract</b> <b>is</b> being written and signed, {{there is no}} automatic mechanism available in every situation that can be utilized to detect the validity or enforceability of that contract. Practically, a <b>contract</b> can <b>be</b> declared to be void by a court of law. So the main question is that under what conditions can a <b>contract</b> <b>be</b> deemed as void? ...|$|R

2500|$|Typically, <b>contracts</b> <b>are</b> oral or written, but written <b>contracts</b> have {{typically}} <b>been</b> preferred in common law legal systems; [...] in 1677 England passed the Statute of Frauds which influenced similar statute of frauds {{laws in the}} United States and other countries such as Australia. In general, the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted in the United States requires a written contract for tangible product sales in excess of $500, and real estate <b>contracts</b> <b>are</b> required to be written. If the <b>contract</b> <b>is</b> not {{required by law to}} be written, an oral <b>contract</b> <b>is</b> valid and therefore legally binding.

5|$|Orr's first {{professional}} <b>contract</b> <b>was</b> {{one of the}} first in professional ice hockey to be negotiated by an agent. It made him the highest-paid player in NHL history as a rookie. His second <b>contract</b> <b>was</b> the first million-dollar contract in the NHL. However, after his retirement, Orr learned he was deeply in debt and he had to sell off most of what he owned. Orr broke with his agent Alan Eagleson and sued the Black Hawks to settle his contract. Orr and his family returned to Boston where Orr went into business to rebuild his finances. Orr aided the investigations that led to Eagleson's fraud convictions and disbarment. Orr also supported the lawsuit that exposed the corruption of the NHL's pension plan.|$|E
