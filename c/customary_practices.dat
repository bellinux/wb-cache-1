The procedures for managing intrastate and inter-ethnic issues include international supervision, regional economic unions, minority protection, plebiscites, and territorial partition. The Palestine and Bosnian Partition Plans and European Union practice are modern examples of conditioning recognition of statehood on human rights, democracy, and minority protection guarantees.|$|E
5|$|In the English towns the {{burgage tenure}} for urban {{properties}} was established {{early on in}} the medieval period, and was based primarily on tenants paying cash rents rather than providing labour services. Further development of a set of taxes that could be raised by the towns included murage for walls, pavage for streets, and pontage, a temporary tax for the repair of bridges. Combined with the lex mercatoria, which was a set of codes and <b>customary</b> <b>practices</b> governing trading, these provided a reasonable basis for the economic governance of the towns.|$|E

25|$|Judicial: Sri Lanka's {{judiciary}} {{consists of}} a Supreme Court – the highest and final superior court of record, a Court of Appeal, High Courts {{and a number of}} subordinate courts. The highly complex legal system reflects diverse cultural influences. Criminal law is based almost entirely on British law. Basic Civil law derives from Roman law and Dutch law. Laws pertaining to marriage, divorce, and inheritance are communal. Due to ancient <b>customary</b> <b>practices</b> and/or religion, the Sinhala customary law (Kandyan law), the Thesavalamai, and Sharia law are followed in special cases. The President appoints judges to the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal, and the High Courts. A judicial service commission, composed of the Chief Justice and two Supreme Court judges, appoints, transfers, and dismisses lower court judges.|$|E
25|$|Abrahams spent around 10 {{weeks in}} 1946 in Nyasaland taking {{evidence}} from colonial officials, estate owners and settlers, African politicians and chiefs and missionaries, visiting almost {{all parts of}} the protectorate. He submitted his report in October 1946 and it was published in early 1947. Abrahams identified the main problem as the conflicting African and European concepts of land ownership. In addition, many European landowners either acted illegally towards tenants or exercised their rights harshly and without consideration of <b>customary</b> <b>practices.</b> In part, this was because the system set up following the 1928 Natives on Private Estates Ordinance neither provided the owners with a reliable pool of labour nor enabled them to reduce the numbers living on their estates. Many African tenants, in Abrahams’ view, failed to understand their obligations or the limits on their legal rights. Many Africans living on Native Trust Land felt strong resentment at the large areas of under-used estate land.|$|E
25|$|The Kafala system {{involves}} a sponsor {{who has the}} legal responsibility for a migrant domestic worker during a contract period, making the worker dependent upon the sponsor. The Kafala system is not legally binding in Lebanon because recruiters cannot act as a sponsor. Instead the system {{is made up of}} a number for administrative regulations, <b>customary</b> <b>practices</b> and legal requirements which bind the worker to the recruiter temporarily.. Once in Lebanon, the migrant domestic worker is assigned an employer. A worker may not change employer or break the terms of the contract unless the employer signs a release waiver. This must be done before a notary public and Lebanese authorities give an official release. A worker becomes illegal if they leave without the consent of their sponsor and the official release from the authorities. Human Rights Watch has said that the Kafala system in Lebanon puts workers at risk of exploitation and abuse, while Anti-Slavery International has said that the system {{is one of the major}} causes of vulnerability of migrant workers. The Kafala system means that the sponsor of the migrant domestic worker is legally responsible for the migrant and the state's responsibility for 'alien surveillance' is then passed on to the employer.|$|E

2500|$|Human {{security}} {{focuses on}} the serious neglect of gender concerns under the traditional security model. Traditional security’s focus on external military threats to the state has meant {{that the majority of}} threats women face have been overlooked. It has recently been argued that these forms of violence are often overlooked because expressions of masculinity in contexts of war have become the norm. By focusing on the individual, the human security model aims to address the security concerns of both women and men equally. However, as of recent conflicts, it is believed that the majority of war casualties are civilians and that [...] "such a conclusion has sometimes led to the assumptions that women are victimized by war {{to a greater extent than}} men, because the majority of adult civilians are women, and when the populations of civilian women and children are added together, they outnumber male combatants. Furthermore, in the post-war context women survivors generally outnumber men and so it is often said that women as a group bear a greater burden for post-war recovery".Women are often victims of violence and conflict: they form the majority of civilian deaths; the majority of refugees; and, are often the victims of cruel and degrading practices, such as rape. Women's security is also threatened by unequal access to resources, services and opportunities. The UN Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women, as of 1995, suggested that the problem is not just a social one, but requires evaluation of the political institutions which uphold unequal system of domination. Women's rights are neglected especially in the Middle East and Southeast Asian regions where <b>customary</b> <b>practices</b> are still prevalent. Although there are different opinions on the issue of <b>customary</b> <b>practices,</b> it infringes upon human security's notion where women and men are innated with equal human rights. Attempts to eradicate such violent <b>customary</b> <b>practices</b> requires political and legal approaches where human security in relation to gender should be brought up as the main source of assertion. Such cruel <b>customary</b> <b>practices</b> as honor killing, burning brides and widows, child marriage are still in existence because of women's vulnerability in economic independence and security. Human security in relationship to gender tries to overthrow such traditional practices that are incompatible to the rights of women. Also human security seeks to empower women, through education, participation and access, as gender equality is seen as a necessary precondition for peace, security and a prosperous society.|$|E
2500|$|Jahangir, {{who succeeded}} Akbar in early 17th century, found sati {{prevalent}} among the Muslims of Rajaur (Kashmir). They {{had been converted}} to Islam by Sultan Firoz. During this era, many Muslims and Hindus were ambivalent about the practice, with Muslim attitude leaning towards disapproval. According to Sharma, the evidence nevertheless suggests that sati was universally admired, and both [...] "Hindus and Muslims went in large numbers to witness a sati". According to Reza Pirbhai, the memoirs of Jahangir suggest sati continued in his regime, was practiced by Hindus and Muslims, he {{was fascinated by the}} custom, and that those Kashmiri Muslim widows who practiced sati either immolated themselves or buried themselves alive with their dead husbands. Jahangir prohibited such sati and other <b>customary</b> <b>practices</b> in Kashmir.|$|E
2500|$|Further {{examples}} of Sahle Selassie's skill in administration is his {{reform of the}} laws of his domain. Courts during the reign of his predecessors Asfa Wossen and Wossen Seged followed both the Fetha Negest, the traditional Ethiopian legal code, as well as <b>customary</b> <b>practices,</b> which Abir states [...] "was extremely cruel. Death sentences, severance of limbs and branding with hot iron were very common." [...] The Negus limited executions to extreme cases of treason, sacrilege and murder, and even then required approval from the Negus. Whenever possible, Sahle Selassie reduced a death sentence to life imprisonment or forfeiture of property; {{in the case of a}} murder conviction, where the traditional Ethiopian penalty was to hand the murderer over to the relatives of the victim, who would then exact their own punishment, the Negus worked to convince the relatives to accept blood money instead of killing the convicted man.|$|E

40|$|The article {{argues that}} Spinoza's {{principle}} of political order represents {{a conception of}} sovereignty which is both historically intelligible and analytically coherent. The appropriateness of four meanings of sovereignty to Spinoza's political theory is considered. Then, after examining Spinoza's use of Hobbes's still influential touchstone for the modern theory of sovereignty, Spinoza's conception is discussed {{in the light of}} the role that <b>customary</b> <b>practice</b> and republicanism play in his political theory. The analysis of sovereignty also prompts engagement with a range of meanings of the notions of constitutionalism and absolute rule. The argument demonstrates that while Spinoza employs some different criteria, he establishes a conception of sovereignty which needs to be recognised as no less internally consistent than Hobbes's. Moreover, both conceptions contain problems. Although Hobbes demonstrates the abstract logic of authority, the theoretical consequence he draws concerning sovereignty entailing a unitary state has been successfully challenged. Spinoza's conception of sovereignty is based on the logic of <b>customary</b> <b>practice,</b> but the manner in which <b>customary</b> <b>practice</b> is ultimately unsusceptible of analytical justification renders his notion also vulnerable to challenge...|$|R

2500|$|The {{resettlement}} {{of indigenous}} peoples frequently occurs along demographic lines, but the central stimulus for resettlement is access to desirable territory. Regions free of tropical disease with easy access to trade routes were favorable. When Europeans settled in these desirable territories, natives were forced out and regional power {{was transferred to the}} colonialists. Subsequently, this type of colonial behavior led to the elimination of native populations, not necessarily through genocide, but through the disruption of local <b>customary</b> <b>practices</b> and the transformation of socioeconomic systems. Ugandan academic Mahmood Mamdani cites [...] "the destruction of communal autonomy, and the defeat and dispersal of tribal populations" [...] as one primary factor in colonial oppression. Europeans justified settler colonialism with the belief that the settlers were more capable of utilizing resources and land than the indigenous populations due to the introduction of modern agricultural practices. As agricultural expansion continued through the territories, native populations were further displaced to clear fertile farmland.|$|E
2500|$|The Chief Justice went on {{to state}} that “the {{carrying}} out of those threats by the orders banishing Metia and thus preventing him from properly performing the duties {{for which he was}} elected were clearly contrary to the spirit and intent of the Constitution and a totally unacceptable intrusion into the workings of the Tuvaluan Parliament. It should be borne in mind that the supremacy given Parliament by the Constitution is over {{the country as a whole}} and must, therefore, take precedence over purely local interests if the latter are in conflict with the national interest. I am satisfied that, as it was a challenge to parliamentary supremacy, it was unreasonable and was thus a breach of the defendant's right to procedural fairness. Similarly, the order of falaesea, although a part of the <b>customary</b> <b>practices</b> of Nukufetau, was so extremely disproportionate to the actions of the Falekaupule in similar previous cases as to be unfair.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been {{progress}} {{in the area of}} addressing <b>customary</b> <b>practices</b> that endanger women, with laws being enacted in several countries. The Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children is an NGO which works on changing social values, raising consciousness, and enacting laws against harmful traditions which affect the health of women and children in Africa. Laws were also enacted in some countries; for example the 2004 Criminal Code of Ethiopia has a chapter on harmful traditional practices – Chapter III – [...] Crimes committed against life, person and health through harmful traditional practices. In addition, the Council of Europe adopted a convention which addresses domestic violence and violence against women, and calls for the states which ratify it to create and fully adjudicate laws against acts of violence previously condoned by traditional, culture, custom, in the name of honor, or to correct what is deemed unacceptable behavior. The United Nations created the Handbook on effective police responses to violence against women to provide guidelines to address and manage violence through the creation of effective laws, law enforcement policies and practices and community activities to break down societal norms that condone violence, criminalize it and create effect support systems for survivors of violence.|$|E

2500|$|Galicia ( [...] ; Galician: Galicia , Galiza {{but most}} of the time it was leagued to the kingdom of Leon and later to that of Castile, while {{maintaining}} its own legal and <b>customary</b> <b>practices</b> and culture. From the 13th century on, the kings of Castile, as kings of Galicia, appointed an Adiantado-mór, whose attributions passed to the Governor and Captain General of the Kingdom of Galiza from the last years of the 15th century. The Governor also presided the Real Audiencia do Reino de Galicia, a royal tribunal and government body. From the 16th century, the representation and voice of the kingdom was held by an assembly of deputies and representatives of the cities of the kingdom, the Cortes or Junta of the Kingdom of Galicia. This institution was forcibly discontinued in 1833 when the kingdom was divided into four administrative provinces with no legal mutual links. During the 19th and 20th centuries, demand grew for self-government and for the recognition of the culture of Galicia. This resulted in the Statute of Autonomy of 1936, soon frustrated by Franco's coup d'etat and subsequent long dictatorship. After democracy was restored the legislature passed the Statute of Autonomy of 1981, approved in referendum and currently in force, providing Galicia with self-government.|$|E
