40|$|Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is {{a viable}} therapy for end stage heart failure. However, despite {{clinical}} success, the ability to compare MCS devices in vitro and perform training scenarios is extremely limited. Comparative studies are limited as different devices cannot be interchanged in a patient due to the surgical nature of implant. Further, training and failure scenarios cannot be performed on patients with devices as this would subject a patient to a failure mode. A need exists for a readily available mock system that can perform comparative testing and training scenarios with MCS devices. Previously, our group has fabricated a well characterized mock circulation system consisting of a SynCardia temporary Total Artificial Heart (TAH) and Donovan Mock <b>Circulation</b> <b>tank</b> (DMC tank). Further, utilizing this system with the TAH operating in reduced output mode, a heart failure model was developed. In the present study, three ventricular assist devices (VADs) were independently attached to the heart failure model to compare device performances over a range of preloads and afterloads. In addition, specific clinical scenarios were created with the system to analyze how VAD-displayed waveforms from the system correlate with clinical scenarios. Finally, each VAD was powered off while attached to the heart failure model to compare fluid flow through the VAD in a pump-failure scenario. We demonstrated that this system can successfully be utilized to compare MCS devices (i. e. ventricular assist devices) and for successful training of patients and clinicians...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFractured {{carbonate}} reservoirs {{are susceptible}} to blowout and lost circulation during drilling, which not only restricts drilling speed, but also poses big threat to well control. Moreover, there are few technical means available to reconstruct pressure balance in the borehole. Accordingly, the fine managed pressure drilling {{was used in the}} drilling of Well GS 19 in the Qixia Formation with super-high pressure and narrow density window, which is a success: ① back pressure in the annular spaces will be adjusted to maintain a slightly over-balanced bottom-hole hydraulic pressure, and fluid level in the <b>circulation</b> <b>tank</b> will be kept in a slight dropping state to ensure that natural gas in the formation would not invade into the borehole in a massive volume; ② inlet drilling fluid density will be controlled at around 2. 35  g/cm 3, back pressures in the annular be maintained at 2 – 5  MPa, and bottom-hole pressure equivalent circulation density be controlled at 2. 46 – 2. 52  g/cm 3; ③ during managed pressure drilling operations, if wellhead pressure exceeds or expects to exceed 7  MPa, semi-blind rams will be closed. Fluids will pass through the choke manifold of the rig to the choke manifold specifically for pressure control before entering gas/liquid separators to discharge gas; ④ during tripping back pressure will be kept at less than 5  MPa, volume of injected drilling fluid will be higher than the theoretical volume during tripping out, whereas the volume of returned drilling fluid will be higher than the theoretical volume during the out-tripping. This technique has been applied successfully in the drilling of the Qixia Formation, Liangshan Formation and Longmaxi Formation with a total footage of 216. 60  m, as a good attempt in complicated wells with both blowout and lost circulation risks, which can provide valuable experiences and guidance for handling similar complexities in the future...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Heart failure {{remains a}} major public health problem, with recent {{estimates}} indicating that end-stage heart failure with two-year mortality rates of 70 - 80 % affects over 60, 000 patients in the US each year. Medical management can be used but success declines for patients with end stage heart failure. Although cardiac transplantation is optimal, less than 2500 cardiac transplants are performed annually due to the severely limited supply of donor organs. Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices are now routinely used to bridge patients with end-stage heart failure who become critically ill until a donor heart is available. The use of stem cell therapy to treat heart failure has been gaining significant ground in recent years, specifically due to its regenerative properties, and both animal and human models have shown significant improvements in ventricular mass, ejection fraction, vascularization, wall thickness, and infarct size reduction. Using the patients' HeartWare HVAD device diagnostics, {{we were able to}} acquire our response variable; pulsatility. Pulsatility is a variable measure of the differential between minimum and maximum flow and is dependent on device motor speed, power, current, and fluid viscosity. This measurement is important {{as it relates to the}} contractility of the heart and could potentially be used as an end point in determining when a patient is healthy enough to have their HVAD explanted. We set out to develop a low cost and effective predictive model to determine amniotic mesenchymal stem cell's ability to repair compromised cardiac tissue of patients using the Total Artificial Heart (TAH) and Donovan Mock <b>Circulation</b> <b>Tank</b> (DMC). Methods: Predictive modelling was performed using the TAH and DMC. The system was set to a range from critical heart failure to a normal operating conditions through the variation of preload, afterload, and ventricular drive pressures with the intent of comparing the results to our patient population. Patients (n= 7, 3 dilated, 4 ischemic) received intravenous and intra-myocardial injections of a heterogeneous amniotic mesenchymal stem cells mixture and liquid matrix (MSCs+LM) at HVAD implant. Groups were analyzed based on treatment; control (HVAD only, n= 7) versus stem cells (HVAD + MSCs+LM). HeartWare log files were acquired from patients' devices and analyzed in SAS and Matlab. Results from the patient study were compared to the predictive model to determine levels of stem cell response. Results: Pulsatility was found to increase with left drive pressure and afterload. Lower drive pressures resulted in a drop off in pulsatility at higher afterloads while higher drive pressures were able to compensate for any afterload. Pulsatility also increased with preload but lower drive pressures were unable to fully eject at the highest preloads, resulting in a reduced pulsatility. We observed the effects of the stem cell injections on pulsatility and found that patients receiving therapy demonstrated statistically significant increases in pulsatility at 15 - 20 (p=. 0487), 25 - 30 (p=. 0131), 35 - 40 (p=. 0333), and 75 - 80 (p= 0. 0476) days post implant. At minimum, when comparing the patient results to the in vitro model, the therapy resulted in a progression from end stage HF conditions to medium cardiac function conditions. At maximum, the therapy resulted in a progression from end stage HF to normal healthy operating cardiac function. Conclusions: Stem cells demonstrated a significantly increased rate of change in pulsatility within the first 40 days and at 80 days post implant when compared to control. They also demonstrated progression from end stage HF to normal healthy cardiac function at two time periods (Days 40, 90). These results justify expansion of the study to encompass a larger patient population to verify the results of the in vitro model to predict cardiac regeneration with multiple functional status indicators...|$|E

40|$|The {{pressure}} {{of economic development}} from the last 50 years {{in the area of}} Prut river, the protection measures against floods by building dams in the major river bed and the building of the hydrotechnical knot Stânca-Costeşti have been the causes of the transformation of the typical habitats in the humid areas at the border of Prut river, thus of the flood area favouring the breeding of fish and birds, endangering the ecological integrity of the area eco-system complex. In the past, Romanian Waters National Company the main manager of the water resources from Romania has started the preparation {{at the request of the}} Ministry of Water Forest and Environment Protection the inventory of the wetland and floodplains at national level, including the potential for restoration according with the particular case from Romania, where the process of land restitution to the previous owners is one important problem even in present time. In Prut catchment area is presented a large number of existing wetlands with a large restoration potential (about 200 wetlands recorded for whole Prut basin, many of them are less than 1 sqkm surface). It has to be mentioned that several wetlands which in present are in natural stage are included or will be included in the List of Protected Areas under the legislation preservation. In this regard the planning of wetlands and floodplains rehabilitation is underdevelopment and will depend by the finalization of the land restitution action. For all the types of existing habitats housing a large variety of fauna (especially avifauna), sedentary as well as migrating or passing fauna, the Maţa – Rădeanu humid area, with a surface of 386 ha, is similar to the special preservation areas from the Danube Delta. Among the protected areas within lower Prut basin, according to the criteria of habitat identification, three of them (Ostrovul Prut, Lower Prut river meadow and Vlascuta swamp) have been indicated to include some wetlands as well. Also, we propose the following potential demonstration sites for wetland management and restoration projects in the Lower Prut basin: Prut flood plain, downstream of Sovarca swamp, up to the mouth point in the Danube; Brates Lake located NE from Galaţi city, connected with the Prut river by the valley of Ghimia brook and Horincea hydrographical basin. Potential solutions for wetland floodplain habitats management involve technical and organisational issues, but some severe law aspect as well. The hydro potential of the sub-basins of this stream opens the door to elaborating an unified scheme in line with landscape features, hydrology and geology of the area. In this respect a complex arrangement of Horincea subbasin, Oancea, Bisericii and Stoenesei valleys which are located in an area of moisture deficit becomes essential. To complete the sub-basin planning, they should be viewed as indivisible natural units. The entire range of hydrotehnical works in this basin aimed to regulate the water stream in order to to avoid negative effects of flooding and must nevertheless respect the principles of ecological planning in order to avoid failures occurring after the completion of this type of works. Regarding the industrial and diffuse pollution which have an impact on Prut ecology and  water quality, this being closely linked with the ecology of the floodplain forested corridor and the existing wetlands, the situation is much severe in the upper part of the basin, based on a large concentration of industry, agriculture and human settlements in comparison with the lower Prut where the impact is much smaller. We mention this can be subject for another study of ecological issues in this basin. When considering the environmental planning should start from the principle that the streams in the Prut basin represent simultaneously ways of <b>circulation,</b> <b>tanks</b> and complex ecological zones which are in strict interaction with the surrounding areas. </p...|$|R
40|$|Expansion tank is an {{important}} component of all single-phase natural <b>circulation</b> loops. The <b>tank</b> serves the twin purposes of venting the air out during the loop filling and accommodation of the swells and shrinkages of the loop fluid during the transient. In the present study, experimental investigations have been carried out in a rectangular single-phase natural circulation loop to bring out the role of expansion tank in loop dynamics. The results on loop stability and transient behavior are discussed. The experimental investigations show that there is significant amount of heat exchange between the main loop fluid and the expansion tank fluid. First, the results of experimental studies are presented. The different flow regimes observed in these experimental investigations are discussed. Next, a model is presented for taking into account the heat exchange between the main loop fluid and the expansion tank fluid. Finally, the model is applied to simulate the dynamic behavior of different single-phase natural circulation loops. The investigations carried out in this study have helped in resolving the issue of hysteresis observed in these loops. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The simulation was performed using the TRNSYS environment. This software also includes a detailed database with weather parameters for several cities all over the world. The system was simulated using specially designed control strategies and varying the main design variables. In particular, a variable speed pump on the solar collector was implemented, in order to maximize the tank temperature and minimize heat losses. A cost model was also developed in order to calculate operating and capital costs. Then, a case study is presented and discussed, aiming at determining the performance of the system, from both energetic and economic viewpoints, in a specific application.

40|$|Hydrodynamic flow {{visualization}} {{techniques of}} scaled hull forms and propellers are typically limited to isolating certain operating conditions in a tow <b>tank,</b> <b>circulation</b> tunnel, or large maneuvering basin. Although cost effective, these tests provide a limited {{perspective on the}} interactions of the entire system. Full-scale testing, other the other hand, provides real world data but is costly. In between, a Froude scaled, free-running model of an existing hull form controls costs but also provides superior hydrodynamic data that can be translated more accurately to full scale. This thesis details the design and construction of a 1 / 3 0 th scale free running model of the David Taylor Model Basin 5415 hull, the precursor to the ubiquitous Arleigh Burke Guided Missile Destroyer hull. The model serves as an experimental platform for advanced maneuvering and propeller crashback studies. The propeller crashback (a core propulsion plant test for both the U. S. Navy and commercial vessels) imparts significant unsteady loads to the engineering plant and drive train. Each of these is respectively of interest to propeller designers and the Electric Ship Research and Development Consortium (ESRDC). The 1 / 3 0 th scale model provides unsteady, time-resolved, accurate 3 D flow visualization and propeller loading data as well as measurements of the effects on the electrical propulsion motors. Testing conducted with the model provides the real world effects of the propeller flow interaction with the hull and appendages. The second area of research concerns the high inefficiencies of slender hull forms while maneuvering. During a turn, {{a significant amount of}} power is lost to the low pressure region developed {{on the inside of the}} turn from shedding vortices that originate along the keel. This increases the tactical diameter of the turn and reduces the turning efficiency of the vessel. Research is currently being conducted around controlling the shedding of vortices and keeping them attached to the hull thereby increasing the turning efficiency and decreasing the turning radius of the vessel. The final area of interest is in forward mounted podded propulsors for use on large vessels. by David M. Cope. Thesis (Nav. E. and S. M.)

40|$|In this paper, the {{simulation}} {{of the performance}} of solar-assisted heating and cooling systems is analyzed. Three different plant layouts are considered: (i) the first one consists of evacuated solar collectors and a single-stage LiBr-H 2 O absorption chiller; here in order to integrate the system in case of insufficient solar radiation, an electric water-cooled chiller is activated; (ii) configuration of the secondly considered system is similar to the first one, but the absorption chiller and the solar collector area are sized for balancing about 30 % of the building cooling load only; (iii) the layout of the thirdly considered system differs from the first one since the auxiliary electric chiller is replaced by a gas-fired heater. Such system configurations also include: <b>circulation</b> pumps, storage <b>tanks,</b> feedback controllers, mixers, diverters and on/off hysteresis controllers. All such devices are modelled for maximizing the system energy efficiency. In order to simulate the systems' performance for dynamic heating/cooling loads, a single-lumped capacitance building is also modelled and implemented in the computer code. A cost model is also developed in order to calculate the systems' operating and capital costs. All the models and the relative simulations are carried out by TRNSYS. A design of experiment procedure is also included. By such tool the effects of the system operating parameters' variation on the relative energy efficiency are analyzed. In addition, the set of synthesis/design variables maximizing the system's energetic performance can be also identified. The annual primary energy saving is chosen as the optimization objective function, whereas collector slope, pump flows, set-point temperatures and tank volume are selected as optimizing system design variables. A case study was developed for an office building located in South Italy. Here, the energetic and the economic analysis for all the three considered system layouts are carried out. The simulations' results are referred to both the initial and the optimized systems configurations. The highest primary energy saving vs. the reference traditional HVAC system is reached by the first considered system layout. The economic performance of the investigated solar heating/cooling systems is still unsatisfactory. The economical profitability of the considered solar heating and cooling systems can be improved only by significant public finding. From this point of view, the best results were achieved by the second above mentioned system configuration. Solar cooling Dynamic simulation Design of experiment...|$|R
40|$|The study {{considered}} {{development of}} a finite-element numerical simulation model {{for the analysis of}} fluid flow and conjugate heat transfer in a zero boil-off (ZBO) cryogenic storage system. A spherical tank was considered for the investigation. The tank wall is made of aluminum and a multi-layered blanket of cryogenic insulation (MLI) has been attached {{on the top of the}} aluminum. The tank is connected to a cryocooler to dissipate the heat leak through the insulation and tank wall into the fluid within the tank. The cryocooler has not been modeled; only the flow in and out of the tank to the cryocooler system has been included. The primary emphasis of this research has been the fluid <b>circulation</b> within the <b>tank</b> for different fluid distribution scenario and for different level of gravity to simulate all the potential earth and space based applications. The steady-state velocity, temperature, and pressure distributions were calculated for different inlet positions, inlet velocities, and for different gravity values. The simulations were carried out for constant heat flux and constant wall temperature cases. It was observed that a good flow circulation could be obtained when the cold entering fluid was made to flow in radial direction and the inlet opening was placed close to the tank wall. The transient and steady state heat transfer for laminar flow inside a circular microtube within a rectangular substrate during start up of power has also been investigated. Silicon, Silicon Carbide and Stainless Steel were the substrates used and Water and FC- 72 were the coolants employed. Equations governing the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy were solved in the fluid region. Within the solid wafer, the heat conduction was solved. The Reynolds number, Prandtl number, thermal conductivity ratio, and diameter ranges were: 1000 [...] 1900, 6. 78 [...] 12. 68, 27 [...] 2658, and 300 µ m [...] 1000 µ m respectively. It was found that a higher aspect ratio or larger diameter tube and higher thermal conductivity ratio combination of substrate and coolant requires lesser amount of time to attain steady state. It was seen that enlarging the tube from 300 µ m to 1000 µ m results in lowering of the fluid mean temperature at the exit. Nusselt number decreased with time and finally reached the steady state condition. It was also found that a higher Prandtl number fluid attains higher maximum substrate temperature and Nusselt number. A correlation for peripheral average Nusselt number was developed by curve-fitting the computed results with an average error of 6. 5 %. This correlation will be very useful for the design of circular microtube heat exchangers...|$|R

The study considered a cylindrical tank with elliptical top and bottom. The tank wall ismade of aluminum and a multi-layered blanket of cryogenic insulation (MLI) has been attached {{on the top}} of the aluminum. The tank is connected to a cryocooler to dissipate the heat leak through the insulation and tank wall into the fluid within the tank.

The primary emphasis of this research has been the fluid <b>circulation</b> within the <b>tank</b> for different fluid distribution scenario and for different level of gravity to simulate all potential earth and space based applications. The equations solved in the liquid region included the conservation of mass, conservation of energy, and conservation of momentum. For the solid region only the heat conduction equation was solved. The steady-state velocity, temperature and pressure distributions were calculated for different inlet positions, inlet opening sizes, inlet velocities and for different gravity values. The above simulations were carried out for constant heat flux and constant wall temperature cases. It was observed from single-phase analysis that a good flow circulation can be obtained when the cold entering fluid was made to flow in radial direction and the inlet opening was placed close to the tank wall. For a two-phase analysis the mass and energy balance at the evaporating interface was taken into account by incorporating the change in specific volume and latent heat of evaporation. A good flow circulation in the liquid region was observed when the cold entering fluid was made to flow at an angle to the axis of the tank or aligned to the bottom surface of the tank. The fluid velocity in the vapor region was found to be higher compared to the liquid region. The focus of the study for the later part of the present investigation was the conjugate heat transfer during a confined liquid jet impingement on a uniform and discrete heating source. Equations governing the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy were solved in the fluid region. In the solid region, the heat conduction equation was solved. The solid-fluid interface temperature shows a strong dependence on several geometric, fluid flow, and heat transfer parameters. For uniform and discrete heat sources the Nusselt number increased with Reynolds number. For a given flow rate, a higher heat transfer coefficient was obtained with smaller slot width and lower impingement height. The average Nusselt number and average heat transfer coefficient are greater for a lower thermal conductivity substrate...|$|R
