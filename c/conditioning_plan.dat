40|$|Municipal waste {{production}} in Venezuela {{and the other}} Latin American and Caribbean countries continues to increase substantially. Given that uncontrolled management of waste in landfills leads to negative environmental impacts, {{there is a need}} to undertake an environmental diagnosis of existing facilities in order to analyse the problems they present and take the necessary measures for reducing adverse effects. The objective of this paper is to study the possibility of applying an environmental diagnosis methodology developed by the University of Granada in order to quantify the environmental impact of urban waste landfills. Seven deposit points located in Estado Lara (Venezuela) were studied. Some modifications in the methodology were introduced to take into account urban waste characteristics and the legal framework in Venezuela. Application of the methodology obtained a series of environmental indexes, making it possible to quantify the impact of the deposit points on the following environmental elements: surface water, groundwater, atmosphere, soil and human health. The indexes were denominated as follows: Environmental Landfill Interaction Index; Environmental Risk Index; Environmental Value and Probability of Contamination. Analysis of results showed significant operation and design problems in all the landfills. The study also made it possible to compile a catalogue of all the deposit points and draw up a list of priorities for action. In the case of Pavía, a <b>Conditioning</b> <b>Plan</b> is required to improve operation and design. In the remaining six deposit points, each index needs to be studied carefully to determine if a <b>Conditioning</b> <b>Plan</b> is sufficient, or if a Sealing and Closing Plan is required owing to the unsuitable location of the deposit points.

40|$|Purpose: To compare game {{activity}} demands between {{female and}} male semiprofessional basketball players. Methods: Female (n = 12) and male (n = 12) semiprofessional basketball players were monitored across 3 competitive games. Time–motion-analysis procedures quantified player activity into predefined movement categories across backcourt (BC) and frontcourt (FC) positions. Activity frequencies, durations, and distances were calculated relative to live playing time (min). Work:rest ratios were also calculated using the video data. Game activity was compared between genders for each playing position and all players. Results: Female players performed at greater running work-rates than male players (45. 7 ± 1. 4 vs. 42. 1 ± 1. 7 m/min, P =. 05), while male players performed more dribbling than female players (2. 5 ± 0. 3 vs. 3. 0 ± 0. 2 s/min; 8. 4 ± 0. 3 vs. 9. 7 ± 0. 7 m/min, P =. 05). Positional analyses revealed that female BC players performed more low-intensity shuffling (P =. 04) and jumping (P =. 05), as well as longer (P =. 04) jogging durations, than male BC players. Female FC players executed more upper-body activity (P =. 03) and larger work:rest ratios (P <. 001) than male FC players. No significant gender differences were observed in the overall intermittent demands, distance traveled, high-intensity shuffling activity, and sprinting requirements during game play. Conclusions: These findings indicate that gender-specific running and dribbling differences might exist in semiprofessional basketball.

40|$|Purpose: The {{monitoring}} of individualized athlete responses to training stimuli {{is important to}} coaches and conditioning staff in team sports. Perceptual (ratings of perceived exertion (RPE)) and physiological (heart rate) models have emerged as {{the most commonly used}} methods to quantify training load in team sports. To date, limited investigation has explored the use of these training load models during basketball-specific conditioning. Furthermore, no research has examined the relationship between perceptual and physiological training load across different modes of basketball conditioning. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to compare perceptual training load responses with physiological methods across a variety of training modes in basketball players. Methods: Eight adult semi-professional male basketball players (age: 26. 3 6 6. 7 years; stature: 188. 1 6 6. 2 cm; body mass: 92. 0 6 13. 8 kg) participated in the study. All players were monitored across general and specific preparatory phases of an annual training plan. The training modes analysed included offcourtoffcourt, repeated linear running and sprinting efforts (43 sampled sessions); on-court intermittent work combined with speed and agility drills (46 sampled sessions); and tactical/game-play conditioning (37 sampled sessions). Following (; 30 min) each training session, players reported their perceived intensity (Borg CR- 10 scale) of the overall session, which was used to calculate perceptual training load (RPE 3 training duration (min)). In addition, heart rate responses were recorded across sessions and used to calculate individual physiological training load via Bannister’s training impulse (TRIMP) and Edwards’ summated-heart rate zones models (ZONE). Correlation analysis was used to compare the perceptual and physiological training load methods during the different training modes. Results: The mean perceptual and physiological training loads (arbitrary units) varied between the linear (RPE: 254 6 74; TRIMP: 62 6 21; ZONE: 123 6 31), intermittent (RPE: 360 6 63; TRIMP: 62 6 19; ZONE: 121 6 32) and tactical/game-play training modes (RPE: 670 6 177; TRIMP: 121 6 32; ZONE: 288 6 58). Significant (p # 0. 05) correlations were observed between perceptual and physiological training load models for each training type. The strongest correlations were apparent during the linear drills (RPE-TRIMP: r = 0. 53; RPE-ZONE: r = 0. 75) andtactical/game-play conditioning (RPE-TRIMP: r = 0. 60; RPEZONE: r = 0. 63). Weaker correlations were evident during the intermittent on-court drills (RPE-TRIMP: r = 0. 38; RPE-ZONE: r = 0. 52). Conclusions: The present data support the agreement between RPE and heart rate methods to quantify training load during various modes of basketball conditioning. Notably, weaker correlations were observed between perceptual and physiological measures during on-court intermittent conditioning. This finding may be due to an increased perceptual demand relative to cardiovascular responses during the multi-directional, intermittent-focused drills performed during this training mode. Practical Applications: The use of either perceptual or physiological training load models by coaches and conditioning staff can be effectively used to monitor individual training demands in basketball team environments. If properly utilized, these practices may permit the development of more precise periodized <b>conditioning</b> <b>plans</b> as well as the prevention of overtraining syndrome in basketball players...|$|R

An overview of the architecture covers the basic operation and related works. 1 INTRODUCTION The design of autonomous control systems for Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) poses challenging problems for control and Artificial Intelligence (AI) research. Traditionally, research in autonomousvehicle control has been largely focused on ground-based mobile robots and domestic (indoor) robots (e. g. [1]). The use of AI for the control of UAVs has been limited by the tendency of researchers in the past to adopt symbolic planning and learning algorithms. Even though UAVs may be classified as mobile robots, the nature of the vehicle and environment dynamics is such that feasable hardware is limited by the constraints of real-time processing. In contrast to ground based vehicles, the processing delays characteristic of symbolic methods are unacceptable during flight. A more appropriate framework, reactive control, concentrates on architectures that perform rapid computation of motor behavior in response to sensory stimuli. Modular design allows the development of sophisticated controllers, where control cells have separate behavioural repertoires covering local regions of the task space. Drawing inspiration from biological systems, reactive control processors frequently consist of parallel or connectionist computing devices, such as Artificial [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Planning the {{development}} of an urban area is a complex operation. In practice, and often intuitively, the required style of the ultimate development is reduced to a series of discrete but converging aims and the plan that is usually adopted attempts to achieve these aims at minimum cost. If only the geological factors which impinge on planning decisions are considered, a particular structure will cost the least to build in locations offering the most favourable ground conditions. A generally more economic venture will also result when the expected cost of building the structures in less geologically-favourable locations is allowed to influence the style of development during the planning process. Unfortunately, suitably precise geological and geotechnical information for <b>conditioning</b> the <b>planning</b> decision is seldom available at this early stage of urban development. Balanced against the cost of geological data collection are the concomitant savings which arise from a reduced risk of foundation failure. When the two, costs and savings, are equal, further testing and analysis become financially redundant. However, the benefit to the overall urban development costs brought about by performing site investigation can be prone to much uncertainty. In this thesis, a probabilistic method for the evaluation of the economic advantage likely to accrue from site investigation activity has been developed. As a demonstration of the application of this theoretical analysis, the actual site investigation for a settlement tank at Howdon sewage treatment works (near Newcastle-upon-Tyne) has been examined. During urban development, most geological and geotechnical data are collected immediately prior to the foundation design stage. In order that geotechnical data can be made available at the early stages of planning or for higher level probabilistic evaluation, a digital computation facility for the storage and processing of considerable quantities of data is necessary. In discussing the use of such a facility the thesis describes a suite of computer programmes called Geosys which have been written for the storage, retention, retrieval and presentation of geotechnical data obtained during site investigation studies...|$|R

In France, the 2000 law of Urban Reform and Solidarity (“Solidarité et Renouvellement Urbain”) provides a legal framework to land use decentralization. It requires the planning design process to be participative and to involve civil society through consultation phases. It also addresses the issue of coherence among legal planning documents along the scale hierarchy, the larger scale <b>plan</b> <b>conditioning</b> the others. In the Reunion Island, the multi-level institutional system includes a region, its four micro-regions and 26 districts; each having their own land use plan. The revision of the regional plan (“Schéma d’Aménagement Régional”, SAR) was the opportunity to revisit the various plans to make them more coherent across scales. This paper presents how research was included in this political process. The SAR revision was initially thought as a one-scale regular participatory foresight process in three stages, i. e. (1) a land use assessment (diagnostic); (2) the definition and discussion of contrasted scenarios; (3) the development of the final land use plan. The overall consultation process involved a large group of participants, including members of various institutions and of the civil society.

40|$|W hen a new {{building}} smells moldy, the owner’s first phone call isoften to the building’s HVAC designer. To most people, moldy odors suggest HVAC problems. But while the air system may indeed spread fungal odors, the HVAC system in {{new building}}s is seldom re-sponsible for generating them. In new construction, mold infestations usually are caused by moisture in building materials. That moisture can come from rain or snow before the building is closed in, or from leak-ing water pipes, wet concrete or condensation on surfaces like cold floor slabs during springtime. Conventional HVAC systems are not designed to dry out construction-related moisture. The moisture load from wet materials is simply too large and the dry-ing task too complex for systems that are intended for comfort air <b>conditioning.</b> The better <b>plan</b> is to dry materials quickly with aggressive drying if they get wet through nature or human error. To understand why drying speed is im-portant, it helps to consider life {{from the perspective of}} a mold spore. The spore the spore is dry, so the nutrient broth traverses the spore wall to bring the os-motic pressures on either side of that spore wall into equilibrium. With nutri-ents inside, the spore can generate hy-phae (thin root-like filaments), which are also coated with enzymes. These dissolve more of the moist food, and the fungus thrives. When the food source is plenti-ful and its moisture content high, fungal growth can be rather rapid.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore {{professional}} development themes in experienced strength and conditioning coaches. Strength and conditioning coaches (N = 15, mean age = 34. 3 years, SD = 5. 2 years) with 11. 4 (SD = 4. 9) years experience working with elite, professional, or talented athletes were interviewed about their professional development. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and content analyzed. Over time, subjects’ servicedelivery practices became more flexible and client driven. Their role understanding also broadened to include various dimensions, such as the need to consider various stakeholders and the value of good relationships with athletes. The subjects shifted from relying on external justification for professional decision making to their experience-based knowledge. The subjects believed athlete work experience, interactions with senior strength and conditioning coaches and other colleagues, the professional literature, and nonprofessional experiences, such as their own athletic experience and sales or managerial training, were the primary influences on their professional development. Typically, the subjects experienced anxiety about their competence, both early in their careers and when working in new contexts or with new athlete groups, but over time, they developed increased confidence. In addition, the subjects experienced reduced narcissism over time about the control they had over athletes and their competitive results. The current results provide information about the characteristics of effective strength and conditioning coaches, the ways they develop their competencies to help athletes, and the emotions they experience throughout their careers. These results may help strength and <b>conditioning</b> practitioners in <b>planning</b> and optimizing their professional development and effectiveness with athletes...|$|R
40|$|Background. Recurrence {{of prior}} {{invasive}} fungal infection (relapse rate of 30 - 50 %) limits {{the success of}} stem cell transplantation. Secondary prophylaxis could reduce disease burden and improve survival. Design and Methods. Prospective, open-label, multicenter trial evaluating voriconazole (4 mg/kg/ 12 h intravenous or 200 mg/ 12 h oral) as secondary antifungal prophylaxis in allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients with previous proven/probable invasive fungal infection. Voriconazole was started 48 h after completion of <b>conditioning</b> chemotherapy and <b>planned</b> for 100 - 150 days. Patients were followed for 12 months. The primary endpoint was the incidence of proven/probable invasive fungal infection. Results. Forty-five patients were enrolled, 41 with acute leukemia. Previous invasive fungal infections were proven/probable aspergillosis (n= 31), proven candidiasis (n= 5) and other proven/probable infections (n= 6); prior infection could not be confirmed in three patients. Median duration of voriconazole prophylaxis was 94 days. Eleven patients (24 %) died before 12 months, only one due to systemic fungal disease. Three invasive fungal infections occurred post-transplant: two relapses (one candidemia and one fatal scedosporiosis) and one new zygomycosis in a patient with previous aspergillosis. The 1 -year cumulative incidence of invasive fungal disease was 6. 7 -; 3. 6 %. Two patients were withdrawn from the study due to treatment-related adverse events (i. e. liver toxicity). Conclusions. Voriconazole appears {{to be safe and}} effective for secondary prophylaxis of systemic fungal infection after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The observed incidence of 6. 7 % (with 1 attributable death) is considerably lower than the relapse rate reported in historical controls, thus suggesting that voriconazole is a promising prophylactic agent in this population.

40|$|Intensive use of air <b>conditioning</b> {{encourages}} building’s <b>plan</b> to be deep with {{a minimum}} surface to volume ratio. Modern air conditioned office building in the tropics are also applied external shading on windows or highly reflective glazing to minimize radiant heat gain. Those lead {{to the presence of}} areas that have insufficient daylight level at the work plane. Horizontal Light Pipe (HLP) is one of optical daylighting system that can guide daylight to these areas. Considering that distributing daylight evenly throughout room is important besides providing sufficient daylight level, a shading system, Reflective Louvre (RL) is applied. RL plays role in reducing daylight level at areas near to window and improving daylight uniformity inside room. The research’s aim is to evaluate and explain daylight quantity and distribution of HLP and RL at office space in the tropics. Experiment with physical model 1 : 10 was used as the research method. Illuminance was measured using HOBO U 12 / 12 data logger, on a real sky condition. Comparison of illuminance, daylight ratio and uniformity ratio resulted by Base Case and HLP&RL Case, a typical office building with sidelighting and an office building with HLP and RL application sequentially, simultaneously with daylighting standards were conducted. Results showed that office room with HLP and RL application had a higher average illuminance and daylight ratio than Base Case. HLP and RL introduced consistently average illuminance between 400 - 900 lux, improved illuminance level at deep area of room as 160 - 290 % and decreased illuminance level at area close to window as 8 - 60 %. This combination created high uniformity ratio inside room, as high as 0. 33 - 0. 71. At most time, those illuminance value and uniformity ratio had fulfilled office’s daylighting standards...|$|R
