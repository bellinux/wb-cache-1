40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to detect the {{influence}} of application mode of <b>cleansing</b> <b>agents,</b> on enamel and dentin during the adhesion process of a one-step adhesive system. Materials and Methods: 24 human molars were sectioned into halves along the long axis for enamel and dentin tests. The <b>cleansing</b> <b>agents</b> used were hydrogen peroxide, anionic detergent, and antiseptic solution. In the experiment, these agents were applied with and without friction on enamel and dentin surfaces. A one-step adhesive system (Clearfil S 3 Bond) was applied on dental surface and composite resin cylinders were built using Tygon tubing molds. After 24 h, μSBS test (1 mm/ min) and fracture analysis were performed. Results: There was no statistically significant difference in bond strength values regarding the application mode of <b>cleansing</b> <b>agents</b> for enamel and dentin (p≥ 0, 05). Conclusions: Regarding bond strength, application mode of the <b>cleansing</b> <b>agents</b> used in this study presented the same behavior. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to detect the {{influence}} of (1) storage period of heparinized blood, (2) type of blood and presence of contaminant, (3) application mode of <b>cleansing</b> <b>agents,</b> and (4) efficacy of <b>cleansing</b> <b>agents</b> on contaminated enamel and dentin during the adhesion process of a one-step adhesive system. Materials and Methods: One hundred four human molars were sectioned into halves along the long axis for enamel and dentin tests. Heparinized and fresh blood were obtained from the same donor, applied and dried to maintain a layer of dry blood on the top of samples. The <b>cleansing</b> <b>agents</b> used were hydrogen peroxide, anionic detergent, and antiseptic solution. A one-step adhesive system (Clearfil S 3 Bond) was applied on the dental surface, and composite resin cylinders were built up using Tygon tubing molds. After 24 h, the mu SBS test (1 mm/min) and fracture analysis were performed. Results: There was no statistically significant difference in bond strength values regarding the storage period of heparinized blood and the types of blood. Groups without contamination presented higher bond strengths than contaminated groups. The application mode of the <b>cleansing</b> <b>agents</b> had no influence on bond strength results. There was no statistically significant difference among <b>cleansing</b> <b>agents</b> and they were as effective as a water stream in counteracting the effect of blood contamination. Conclusion: Heparinized blood can be used as a contaminant for up to one week, and it is a reliable procedure to standardize the contaminant. The <b>cleansing</b> <b>agents</b> can be used without friction. A water stream is sufficient to remove blood contamination from dental tissues, before the application of a one-step adhesive system...|$|R

Limekilns seem to have come into regular use about the 18th century and were located at Wheatrig, Haysmuir, Bonshaw, High Chapeltoun, Sandylands (now Bank End) and Alton. Large limestone blocks were used for building but the smaller pieces were burnt, using coal dug in the parish to produce lime which was a useful commodity in various ways: it could be spread on the fields to reduce acidity, for lime-mortar in buildings or for lime-washing on farm buildings.

2500|$|The {{astringency}} {{associated with}} wine is usually {{derived from a}} wine's tannins. Tannins add a gritty texture and chalky, astringent taste. It can enhance the perception of [...] "body" [...] or weight in the wine. Tannins are normally derived from the skins, seeds, and stems of the grapes themselves (leeched out during the maceration process) or from contact with oak during barrel aging. Tannins react with proteins. When paired with dishes that are high in proteins and fats (such as red meat and hard cheeses), the tannins will bind to the proteins and come across as softer. In the absence of protein from the food, such as some vegetarian dishes, the tannins will react with the proteins on the tongue and sides of the mouth—accentuating the astringency and having a drying effect on the palate. Various cooking methods, such as grilling and blackening can add a bitter [...] "char" [...] component to the dish that will allow it to play well with a tannic wine. While fish oils can make tannic wines taste metallic or off. Astringent tannic wines like Barolo and Cabernet Sauvignon can overwhelm a lot of foods but can be soften by fatty foods {{with a lot of}} proteins such as hard cheeses or meats. The dry tannins also serve as a <b>cleansing</b> <b>agent</b> on the palate by binding to the grease and oils left over in the mouth. Spicy and sweet foods can accentuate the dry, bitterness of tannins and make the wine seem to have off flavors.|$|E

A routine of denture cleansing {{is essential to}} prevent biofilm formation and the onset of this infection. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effectiveness of combining brushing and <b>cleansing</b> <b>agents</b> in killing C. albicans biofilm. Disks of acrylic resin were made, sterilized, and inoculated with C. albicans (10 (7) cfu/mL). After incubation (37 °C/ 48 h), specimens were randomly assigned to 10 experimental groups (n= 9) : 5 subjected to brushing with distilled water or <b>cleansing</b> <b>agents</b> - dentifrice slurry, 2 % chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX), 1 % sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), and Polident fresh cleanse® (combined method) - and 4 exposed to the <b>cleansing</b> <b>agents</b> without brushing (immersion). Non-cleansed specimens were used as positive controls. The viability of cells was evaluated by XTT reduction method. Results were analyzed by Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests (&# 945;= 0. 05). The combined method was significantly more effective (p< 0. 0001) in reducing biofilm viability than the immersion. Brushing with CHX and NaOCl resulted in 100 % removal of the biofilm. Immersion in the agents reduced significantly (p< 0. 0001) the biofilm viability, with CHX being the most effective (p< 0. 0001). The use of the combined method of brushing with <b>cleansing</b> <b>agents</b> is an effective method to reduce C. albicans biofilm, being CHX and NaOCl the most effective solutions...|$|R

Toluene level was as high as 498 μg/m 3 in a hotel fitted with lots of plywood products. The highest concentrations of methylene chloride (34 μg/m 3) and total carbonyls (517 μg/m 3) were detected in a hotel where high VOCs <b>cleansing</b> <b>agents</b> were used in guest rooms. In another hotel located in an industrial centre, acetone concentration of 102 μg/m 3 was observed. The second highest total VOCs concentration (445 μg/m 3) was observed in a newly renovated hotel.
