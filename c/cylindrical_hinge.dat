40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} use of magnetorheological (MR) dampers to semi-actively control wind induced {{vibrations}} of a 1 / 20 scaled wind tower model. The idea consists in realizing a variable restraint {{at the base of}} the model, able to modify in real time its mechanical properties according to the instantaneous response of the tower. The restraint is made up of a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>hinge,</b> two springs and two prototype MR devices, the behavior of the latter being driven by control algorithms aiming to reduce the structural demand imposed to the steel tower. The demand is expressed in terms of base bending stress and top displacement. The model has been tested on a shaking table facility at the Denmark Technical University in Copenhagen imposing two different type of accelerograms at the base, equivalent to an extreme short operating gust and a longer high wind speed excitation, respectively. Two distinct control algorithms, each designed according to different philosophies and goals, have been adopted to drive the semi-active devices. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed control technique in reducing the stress demand at the base, this at the cost, in the worst case, of a slight increase of top displacement. They encourage investigating further in this direction in order to promote {{the use of}} such strategy for a cost effective design of high wind towers...|$|E

The robot is a chain of five links connected in series by active <b>cylindrical</b> <b>hinges</b> with the central link being {{the body and the}} remainder forming folding wings in pairs. The distinctive feature of this device is that the flaps of its wings imitate those of a seagull i. e. the device has a biological prototype. We construct a mathematical model of this device; much attention is given to the model of the interaction of the wings with the air environment and we determine the positions and velocities of points of application of the reduced aerodynamic forces to each of the links. Based on the results of numerical modelling of the vertical flight of the robot three modes of flight were established: ascent, hovering at a certain height and descent. The device can operate in these modes based on the oscillation parameters of the wings in particular flapping frequency and amplitude, the ratio of the amplitudes of two links and one wing and the shift of the equilibrium oscillation position of the wings relative to zero...|$|R

40|$|The article {{considers}} regularities of {{the influence}} of forces of viscous resistance generated by the damper device in the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>hinges</b> of the nodes connect the links of the crane-manipulator units mobile transport-technological ma-chines. The specified effect is considered on the efficiency of the damping of oscillations of the metal in the process of operation, due to the presence of increased clearances due to wear of the holes of the hinge eyes. It is shown that the force of viscous resistance should be considered in addition to the generated damping devices forces of elastic resis-tance, as the latter determine the effectiveness of damping in general. The main role of forces of viscous resistance is the dissipation of energy of an oscillatory turning movement of the mating parts of the metal structures due to oscilla-tory displacement of the hinge pin within the hinge gap until the complete decay of oscillations. Considered in relation to the crane-manipulator installing mobile transport-technological machines AST- 4 -A the effect of the action of forces of viscous resistance is almost not observed when the coefficient of viscous damping less than 0. 01 MN∙s/m, in the range 0, 01 [...] . 0, 05 MN∙s/m this influence begins to manifest itself more and more noticeable, in the range of 0, 05 [...] . 0, 4 MN∙s/m has a lot of damping vibrational displacement of the hinge pin within the gap, while the coefficient of viscous damping more than 0. 4 MN∙s/m oscillatory process becomes aperiodic with an almost complete attenuation in the range of one oscillation of the hinged finger...|$|R
40|$|Amphiphilic diblock {{copolymers}} form various self-assembled {{structures in}} water. Of {{particular interest to}} the biophysics and bioengineering community are the vesicle morphology, which mimics the shell of biological cells, and the cylindrical worm micelle morphology, that mimics the cytoskeleton and various biofilaments in the body. This thesis explores an aspect of biological relevance of copolymer membranes, as well as develops tools and methodologies for engineering worm micelles that would enable their applicability as bio-scaffolds and stiffness tunable high aspect-ratio colloidal systems. Copolymer membranes are used as model systems to study the interaction of antimicrobial peptides with uncharged, thick, single component bilayer membranes. It is found that certain antimicrobial peptides indeed lyse polymer vesicles whose bilayers are many times the peptide length. A thorough study of the mechanism of this interaction is presented and a possible mechanism of interaction is proposed. A novel and elegant method to visualize the worm micelles as they are manipulated by an external electric field is also presented in this thesis. Finally, {{a new class of}} glassy, <b>hinged</b> <b>cylindrical</b> micelles is introduced, and it is characterized for its applicability as a stable, stiffness controllable, and shape controllable colloidal system.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{modeling}} and simulation of a hinged 5 body wave energy converter (WEC), including verification by comparison with experimental results. The WEC consists of a shallow draft <b>cylindrical</b> center floater <b>hinged</b> to 4 semisubmerged spherical buoys. One important design feature is that the hinges are submerged such that the buoys will move in a diagonal-like mode of motion. In {{the first part of}} the thesis, the linear theory of power absorption by oscillating bodies is reviewed, having particular emphasis on multi-degree-offreedom systems and optimization of power take-off parameters bounded by motion amplitude constraints (and a few other constraints). The major part of the thesis deals with time domain analysis and address some modeling challenges associated with the hinged 5 -body WEC and similar WECs. These modeling challenges are associated with: • Strongly frequency dependent added mass and damping and a long hydrodynamic “memory”, representing a challenge when a time domain representation of the radiation forces are sought in the form of a state space model. • Complex equations of motion accounting for rigid hinge constraints. • Large angular motion, particularly in the hinges, giving rise to inertia force nonlinearities. • Large amplitude motion giving rise to greatly varying wetted body surface, making the validity of linear hydrodynamic theory questionable. The first challenge is addressed by introducing a new frequency domain identification technique, originally developed for complex electrical networks, which (to the author’s knowledge) have not been used on hydrodynamic radiation forces before. Assessment and enforcement of the physical property of passivity of the obtained state space models (related to the stability of the equations of motion) will also be addressed. We show that the method is capable of obtaining passive and accurate state space radiation models for the hinged 5 - body WEC and an even more challenging system consisting of 17 equidistant circular cylinders. Equations of motion (EOM) for the hinged 5 -body WEC are developed assuming rigid hinge constraints and by using a minimal number of generalized coordinates. Large angular motions are accounted for. We show that by describing the velocities of all bodies in the body fixed frame of the center floater, the EOM simplify significantly. The large angular motion yields inertia force nonlinearities manifested as a hinge angle dependent mass matrix and a Coriolis-Centrifugal force term. However, a numerical study of the hinged 5 -body WEC in a typical operating condition shows that a linearized EOM, assuming small angles, will suffice when the aim is to predict the mean power absorption. Still, the inertia force nonlinearities yields nonlinear behavior and affects the largest maxima and minima significantly, especially in the pitch mode of the center floater. The most important type of nonlinearity is associated with the greatly varying submergence of the bodies, especially for the buoys. In the numerical model, this nonlinearity is accounted for in a simplified manner by including nonlinear Froude-Krylov and restoring forces, while still relying on linear radiation and diffraction forces. The aim of the experiments conducted as part of the thesis work was to verify the numerical model. In addition, different numerical models based on different physical assumptions have been compared. The experiments included five sea states corresponding to typical operating conditions. The overprediction of mean absorbed power by the simulation model in these sea states is between - 15 % (underprediction) and 18 %. When the Froude-Krylov and restoring forces are linearized in the traditional manner, the overprediction range from 60 %, in a sea state producing large amplitude motion, down to 15 %, occurring for a milder sea state. The experiments revealed that mean and low frequency motions of the same order of magnitude as the wave frequency motions are present in all modes of motion except for the collective heave mode. The nonlinear simulation model captures this effect with reasonable accuracy. One interesting finding is that the mean and low frequency surge motion is well captured without inclusion of the explicit second order wave forces traditionally used to analyze slow drift motions.
