40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze the impact <b>of</b> unpaid <b>commitments</b> by the central government on public healthcare financing and national health expenditure estimates. The health spending data were obtained from the federal public budget system, Siga Brasil, and were analyzed for their registration as unpaid commitments and canceled unpaid commitments from 2002 to 2014. We found that healthcare spending by the federal government was lower than the minimum level required by law for most years. As a result, approximately R$ 11. 3 billion were not allocated to public healthcare by the federal government. As for health expenditure estimates, we found that the <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> unpaid <b>commitments,</b> among other issues related to national public accounting, affects the estimation of health spending by the accrual method, which is the recommended regimen in health accounts...|$|R
50|$|The Federal Union under Norm Gallagher faced many protests {{initially}} {{when the}} Federal union intervened {{in the affairs}} of the N.S.W. branch of the union in the mid-seventies. Many of the democratic measures installed by the N.S.W. Branch leadership by Jack Mundey, Bob Pringle and Joe Owens and others were scrapped and many of the democratically imposed Green Bans were lifted. Officials of the N.S.W. Branch eventually urged members to join the imposed branch, but were themselves blacklisted from the industry by Federal Union officials. The Federal takeover of the N.S.W. Branch was instrumental in calling off many of the imposed Green Bans and the <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> the union's <b>commitment</b> to fighting for permanence in the building industry.|$|R
2500|$|The {{band members}} grew their hair long and allied {{themselves}} to the glam rock movement of the early 1970s. Hill's stage costumes also became notable during this period. Many of Holder's costumes during this period, including the trademark mirror top hat, were made by Dorothy [...] "Dolly" [...] Annakin—a sister of Holder's friend Ron Annakin. Chandler now demanded the band write a follow-up single themselves which led to Lea and Holder writing [...] "Coz I Luv You". The song was written {{in half an hour}} and started a writing partnership which would continue throughout Slade's career. Upon hearing the track played to him acoustically, a pleased Chandler predicted the song would make number one. While recording, the band felt the song's sound to be too soft, and so clapping was added. The song's misspelled title also became a trademark for Slade while causing a furor among British school teachers. The attendant appearance on BBC Television's Top of the Pops brought Slade to a wider audience as well as pushing [...] "Coz I Luv You" [...] to number one in the UK charts. In November 1971, NME reported that Slade had turned down a multimillion-dollar campaign, including a television series and a heavily promoted tour of the US. [...] "But", commented Holder, [...] "acceptance would have meant the <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> many <b>commitments</b> here – and the last thing {{we want to do is}} to mess around the people who have put us where we are".|$|R

In this Paper we consider the tax treatment of life insurance, considering the <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> tax incentives in Italian life insurance contracts for investors with high marginal tax rates {{and the introduction of}} incentives for those with low rates. Using repeated cross-sectional data from 1989 to 1998, we find that the tax reforms had no effect on the decision to invest in life insurance or the amount invested.

As a result, the province of Central Java became the region with the largest <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> local regulation in Indonesia, which is as many 90 -local regulations cancelled. The <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> local regulation implicates the obstacles in the implementation of development and district and municipal programs in Central Java - Indonesia. The purpose of this research was to analyze the authority of the region in order to avoid overlapping authority on the <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> local regulation by the Governor as the representative of the Central Government. The method of writing uses a normative approach with qualitative analysis to detect the level of synchronization and harmonization of the application of local regulations. The results indicate that the <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> local regulation by the Governor as the representative of the central government shows an erroneous logic of the implementation of local autonomy. Ideally, the <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> local regulation is performed “one gate”, i. e by the Supreme Court (judicial institution only) through the authority of judicial revie...|$|R
