40|$|Featured price {{cuts are}} a popular tool among brand-manufacturers and {{retailers}}. Yet, {{there is growing}} concern about the net sales and revenue gains from these promotions, as retailers and manufacturers may simply be subsidizing consumers that shop around. This notion has placed the (co-) occurrence of a brand’s promotions across retailers high on the promotion-planning agenda. This paper examines the mechanisms underlying out-of-phase vs. in-phase schedules, and empirically demonstrates their sales and revenue implications in four product categories, <b>covering</b> <b>purchases</b> of a national panel of households across eight years. Our results reveal that calendar effects primarily materialize in categories where the chosen retailer is driven by brand promotions. In those categories, alternating the timing of featured price cuts across chains substantially increases the manufacturer and retailers’ immediate sales lift. However, {{when it comes to}} net gains, striving for out-of-phase promotions – the dominant approach among chains – is not necessarily ‘best practice’: retailers see the revenue advantage diminish, and manufacturers may even earn less...|$|R

40|$|Resistance to {{antibiotics}} is a {{major threat}} to the effectiveness of modern health care. This study examines if pay-for-performance (P 4 P) to care providers stimulates the appropriate use of antibiotics; in particular, if P 4 P can induce a substitution away from broad-spectrum antibiotics, which contribute more to the development of resistance, to less resistance-driving types. In the context of Swedish primary care, we study the introduction of P 4 P indicators encouraging substitution of narrow-spectrum antibiotics for broad-spectrum antibiotics in the treatment of children with respiratory tract infections (RTI). During 2006 - 2013, 8 out of 21 county councils introduced such P 4 P indicators in their reimbursement schemes for primary care providers. We employ municipality-level register data <b>covering</b> all <b>purchases</b> of RTI related antibiotics and exploit the staggered introduction of pay-for-performance in a difference-in-differences analysis. Despite that the monetary incentives were small, we find that P 4 P significantly increased narrow-spectrum antibiotics' share of RTI antibiotics consumption.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this licentiate thesis is to {{describe}} energy use, heating and cooling demands and {{the relative importance of}} internal heat loads in shopping malls. It will be a foundation for a future doctorial thesis in which alternative energy efficient HVAC systems for shopping malls will be analysed. A shopping mall, as defined in this study, is a large shopping centre entirely within a roofed structure, controlled by a limited number of entrances. Stores and other services are only accessible via interior corridors. This thesis is based on information collection (literature reviews, interviews, collection of energy statistics and structuring of information) and a case study of an existing shopping mall (simulations and field measurements). There are countless studies covering energy use in complex buildings in general, but {{there are only a few}} published scientific papers on shopping malls. Results from interviews list the design factors that are considered to be of importance today in Sweden. To this date little statistic has been published on energy use in shopping malls. The Swedish national energy statistics reports energy use in retail, but excludes energy use in shopping malls. This is partly compensated by the recent Stil 2 study which covers energy use in 30 shopping malls. This thesis contributes to this statistical foundation by <b>covering</b> <b>purchased</b> energy use for 41 shopping malls in Sweden and Norway. According to Stil 2 the total purchased energy in shopping malls average 262 kWh/m 2 /year. The corresponding figure for the 41 studied shopping malls were 279 and 291 kWh/m 2 /year for Sweden and Norway respectively. There are significant differences in purchased energy between shopping malls, ranging between 162 - 545 kWh/m 2 /year. This large deviation and the fact that the number of shopping malls is increasing proves the importance of further work. In available energy statistics there are inconsistencies in use of notations, which is discussed in the thesis. During collection of energy statistics it has been evident that there are few shopping malls with well thought-out measurement systems. Purchased energy is always known but there are fewer measurements on how energy is distributed between functions in the building. Use of free cooling and heat recovery are rarely quantified. The first goal for future energy efficiency measures should be to reduce energy demand. Results from simulations show that decreasing the use of lighting provides a great potential for savings. If purchased energy for lighting is decreased it will result in a twofold gain, since less energy is needed for removal of surplus heat. After demands have been reduced new alternative HVAC systems can be designed and adjusted to increase energy efficiency. Due to the characteristics of the heating and cooling demands, HVAC systems with energy storage between day and night, i. e. night time ventilation, and seasonal energy storage, i. e. Borehole Thermal Energy Storage (BTES), are appealing to investigate...|$|R

40|$|Persons {{engaged in}} the {{business}} of rendering service are consumers, not retailers, of the tangible personal property which they use incidentally in rendering the service. Tax, accordingly, applies to the sale of the property to them. If in addition to rendering service they regularly sell tangible personal property to consumers, they are retailers with respect to such sales and they must obtain permits, file returns and remit tax measured by such sales. If their purchases of tangible personal property are predominantly for consumption rather than for resale, they should not give resale certificates <b>covering</b> such <b>purchases</b> but should follow the procedure prescribed in the regulation governing “Tax-Paid Purchases Resold. ” The basic distinction in determining whether a particular transaction involves a sale of tangible personal property or the transfer of tangible personal property incidental to the performance of a service is one of the true object of the contract; that is, is the real object sought by the buyer the service per se or the property produced by the service. If the true object of the contract is the service per se, the transaction is not subject to tax even though some tangible personal property is transferred. For example, a firm which performs business advisory, record keeping, payroll and tax services for small businesses and furnishes forms, binders, and other property to its clients as an incident to the rendition of its services is the consumer and not the retailer of such tangible personal property.

It is found that this diffusion is sharply related to the purchasing, performance assessment and collaboration. These upstream activities are affected by internal functions and the maturity level of environmental and culture of organisation.

40|$|In {{societies}} where {{corruption is}} rife, why do bureaucrats in some agencies extract {{more than enough}} to get rich, while others do not? This dissertation explains why corruption varies across agencies within the same state, when the factors that explain variation across states (e. g. political competition) are weak or absent. In other words, why in corrupt states aren't all agencies equally corrupt? My theory explains how these puzzling cases arise from the interaction between bureaucrats in a hierarchy. They must balance risky collusion necessary to grow the available rents, against competition to take a larger share of these spoils. Characteristics of agencies well-known in the bureaucratic politics literature change the terms of this trade-off, most importantly the degree of information asymmetry between bureaucrats authorizing corruption, and those carrying it out. The greater this asymmetry, the more difficult it is to maintain the collusion necessary to succeed at corruption.

50|$|Campaigning for {{the office}} of prime {{minister}} in 2011, Yingluck Shinawatra pledged to support rice farmers with a plan to purchase rice at above market prices. In June 2011 rice prices were at record highs and Thailand was the world's leading exporter. The Yingluck promise was to buy unmilled paddy rice at 15,000 baht per tonne and premium Hom Mali rice at 20,000 baht per tonne, prices 50 percent or more above the market. The rice would be stored. This, it was thought, would cause world prices to spike. The Thai government would then sell the stockpiled rice at record prices for a profit. Yingluck was elected in September 2011. One week later India lifted its ban on rice exports. Ten million tons of Indian rice flooded the market. Vietnam then lowered its prices. Global prices plummeted. A year later Thailand was no longer the leading rice exporter, dropping to number three after India and Vietnam. Thailand had stockpiled 17-18 million tons of rice that could not be sold at prices <b>covering</b> the <b>purchase</b> price, administration, and storage. Somporn Isvilanonda, a researcher at the Knowledge Network Institute of Thailand, estimated that the government had to sell its rice for at least US$800 (25,000 baht) a tonne to recoup a pledge price of 15,000 baht a tonne. But white rice in 2012 was selling for just US$575 a tonne, and Vietnam sold its rice at only US$450 a tonne. In June 2013, the international credit rating firm, Moody's, brought the scheme's results to the world's attention, reporting that the program would cost up to eight percent of Thailand's national budget and thus force Moody's to reassess the government's credit rating. In its first year, the cost to the Thai government was US$12.5 billion and was expected to rise to US15 billion in 2014. Meanwhile, the rice in storage was deteriorating and suspicions grew that it was being adulterated for profit with the addition of low quality rice from neighbouring countries by criminal gangs and corrupt officials.|$|R

The city proposed using its own funds to renovate the arena, and {{to begin the process of}} planning for a new, greatly expanded multi-purpose convention center and sports arena. As a gesture of good faith, Great Falls city commissioners said they had spent $6,000 to study the ice rink covering issue and $2,000 on a handicapped-accessibility study, and had agreed to spend $200,000 to purchase the ice rink <b>covering.</b> The <b>purchased</b> was designed to meet the needs of local youth hockey organizations, which in 2002 were the arena's largest tenant (paying $65,000 in fees in 2002 and an anticipated $85,000 in fees in 2003). But it was also designed to expand the facility's use, and reduce the city's subsidy to the fairgrounds. [...] Four Seasons managers noted that the arena had to turn away bands, comedians, and other entertainers because the venue could not be turned around fast enough. Cascade County managers, however, argued that although the county did not have the credit rating or tax revenues of the city, they could obtain grants to make the improvements the city was to pay for. They also said that their lack of management expertise did not matter, as they were considering contracting with SMG World, an arena management firm, to run Four Seasons. In October 2002, SMG said it needed more time to assess the fairgrounds in order to make a firm offer. With Cascade County apparently committed to taking over the fairgrounds and Four Seasons Arena again, the city of Great Falls demanded that the county to pay $1 million to reimburse the city for improvements made there (a figure which included $142,250 renovating the heating, air conditioning, and carpeting at the arena). The county refused, and offered to pay less than 20% of that figure. After extensive negotiations, Cascade County agreed to pay $384,370 over 10 years at 4% interest (a total which included all of the improvements to the arena). On November 12, 2002, Cascade County signed a formal agreement to allow SMG World to take over management of the fairgrounds and arena.|$|R

The polymer coatings were identified to be polyethersulphone, polytetrafluroethylene (PTFE), bisphenol A / epichlorohydrin and one coating for which no good match was obtained with infra-red library spectra. All of the products intended for stove-top use had a polymer coating containing PTFE. The coatings were analysed as purchased and after heating at 250 °C for 30 minutes to simulate actual conditions of use. Total solvent extractables were measured and the overall migration was determined into simulants. None of the products exceeded a draft overall migration limit of 10 mg/dm 2. Coating materials were analysed by headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), by liquid extraction followed by GC-MS, and by liquid extraction followed by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy with a particle-beam interface. Benzene was detected in two samples, at 1. 4 and 2. 4 µg/dm 2. These levels in the coatings are too low to give any detectable migration into foods. There was no detectable release of perfluorochemicals. Several other substances were identified and the worst case migration was calculated. The origin {{of many of the}} substances detected was considered to be by pick-up from the printed packaging materials that the cookware was sold in. Potential consumer exposure was calculated.

40|$|Susceptors are {{an example}} of one of the many new {{products}} being introduced into food packaging. They are used to achieve local areas of high temperature; this has the effect of browning the food during microwave cooking. Previous work by Begley et al. had suggested that one particular cold cure adhesive component, bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE), might be present in some susceptor products but gave little indication as to the retail use of these products. As a result an investigation of UK retail samples was carried out in January 1992. Most of the susceptors tested contained no detectable BADGE (< 0. 1 mg/kg), however, two brands of pizza were found to be packaged with susceptors containing BADGE at between 700 and 800 mg/kg (1. 8 - 2. 0 mg/dm 2). Migration of BADGE into the pizzas in question was 01 - 0. 7 mg/kg when they were cooked in their packaging according to on-pack instructions. Further tests undertaken in June 1992 confirmed earlier findings when from a total of 54 samples <b>purchased</b> <b>covering</b> seven manufacturers, nine samples of susceptors used in one brand contained BADGE at concentrations between 1900 and 3200 mg/kg. The manufacturer of this brand has stopped supplying further products to the retail market using this particular type of susceptor. A third set of tests was undertaken in November 1992 to ensure that these products were no longer on sale in the UK. Of 44 susceptors analysed, only one contained BADGE above 0. 1 mg/kg; this appeared to be old stock pre-dating the manufacturers’ action. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
