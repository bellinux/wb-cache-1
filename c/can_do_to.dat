25|$|Edgar Derby: A {{middle-aged man}} who has pulled strings {{to be able to}} fight in the war. He was a high school teacher who felt that he needed to {{participate}} rather than just sending off his students to fight. Though relatively unimportant, he seems to be the only American before the bombing of Dresden to understand what war <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> people.

25|$|Livestock {{production}} {{is by far}} the biggest cause of land use, as it accounts for 30% of the global land surface. It is probably the leading player in biodiversity loss, as it causes deforestation, land degradation, pollution, climate change, overfishing, and invasions by alien species. Livestock is also responsible for at least 20% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, which are the main cause of the current climate change. This is due to feed production, enteric fermentation from ruminants, manure storage and processing, and transportation of animal products. The greenhouse gas emissions from livestock production greatly exceeds the greenhouse gas emissions of any other human activity. Some authors argue that by far the best thing we <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> slow climate change is a global shift towards a vegetarian or vegan diet.|$|E

25|$|Look, if I have a {{triangle}} in midfield – Claude Makélélé behind {{and two others}} just in front – I will always have an advantage against a pure 4–4–2 where the central midfielders are side by side. That's because I will always have an extra man. It starts with Makélélé, who is between the lines. If nobody comes to him {{he can see the}} whole pitch and has time. If he gets closed down it means one of the two other central midfielders is open. If they are closed down and the other team's wingers come inside to help, it means there is space now for us on the flank, either for our own wingers or for our full-backs.

25|$|Most {{charges of}} {{discrimination}} based on price are difficult to verify, without significant documentation. Studies indicate that less than 10% of all {{discrimination based on}} price is actually reported to any authority or regulatory body, and {{much of this is}} through class-action lawsuits. Furthermore, while a number of monitoring services and consumer interest groups take an interest in this form of discrimination, there is very little they <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> change it. Most discrimination based on price occurs in situations without a standardized price list that can be compared against. In the cases of per diem charges, this is easily concealed as few consumers can exchange estimates and work rates, and even if they do the business in question can claim that the services provided had different baseline costs, conditions, etc.|$|E
