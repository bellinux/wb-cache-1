500|$|At {{the dining}} room, Diane orders them {{to wait for}} dinner until the turkey is ready. As suppertime is passing, the turkey is still very undercooked and the {{trimmings}} have gone cold. Carla and Norm start blaming {{each other for the}} turkey's slow cooking. Norm throws some of Carla's peas at her, and she then throws carrots back at him. Cliff throws mashed yams at Frasier, who accidentally throws gravy skin back at Woody, intended for Cliff. The whole gang is poised to start a food fight until Diane stands up and tells them loudly to stop. When she is close to scolding them, Sam throws <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b> at her, so the food fight resumes. By the time the food fight ends, the turkey is finally cooked. The gang calms down and decides to eat what they can. Diane comes out of the kitchen and throws a pumpkin pie to spite Sam for throwing <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b> at her. The pie misses Sam but accidentally hits Vera as she enters. Vera tells Norm to fetch his coat, and Norm says, [...] "Yes, dear." ...|$|E
500|$|Cheri Eichen and Bill Steinkellner {{wrote the}} episode {{and it was}} {{directed}} by James Burrows. Burrows shot the food fight scene twice, with the scene unchoreographed after {{the point where the}} character Sam Malone throws <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b> at Diane Chambers' face. The extended takes resulted in a strong food odor around the set. In one of the food fight takes, the floor was covered with a [...] "plastic tarp" [...] in order to prevent vital materials from being broken while the cast was slipping on the floor during the scene. However, the attempt was ineffective. After the episode aired, the production crew received a few angry letters disapproving of the food fight scene [...] "at a time when world hunger was a political cause du jour." [...] According to Burrows, food not used for the scene was donated to charity.|$|E
50|$|Each Thanksgiving since 1971, Stamberg {{provides}} NPR listeners {{with her}} mother-in-law's {{recipe for a}} <b>cranberry</b> relish <b>sauce</b> that is unusual in having horseradish {{as one of its}} principal ingredients. The recipe is known as Mama Stamberg's Cranberry Relish Recipe, although it was originally published in 1959 by Craig Claiborne in his food column.|$|R

500|$|Some vocalising by Lennon is faintly audible {{at the end}} of the song, {{picked up}} as leakage onto one of the drum {{microphones}} (close listening shows Lennon making other comments to Starr). In the [...] "Paul is Dead" [...] hoax these were taken to be Lennon saying [...] "I buried Paul." [...] In 1974, McCartney said, [...] "That wasn't 'I buried Paul' at all – that was John saying 'cranberry sauce' … That's John's humour … If you don't realise that John's apt to say <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b> when he feels like it, then you start to hear a funny little word there, and you think, 'Aha!'" [...] Shortly before his death in 1980, Lennon expressed dissatisfaction with the final version of the song, saying it was [...] "badly recorded" [...] and accusing McCartney of subconsciously sabotaging the recording.|$|E
500|$|The {{painting}} {{shows an}} aproned matriarch presenting a roasted turkey {{to a family}} of several generations, in Rockwell's idealistic presentation of family values. The patriarch looks on with fondness and approval {{from the head of}} the table, which is the central element of the painting. Its creased tablecloth shows that this is a special occasion for [...] "sharing what we have with those we love", according to Lennie Bennett. The table has a bowl of fruit, celery, pickles, and what appears to be <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce.</b> There is a covered silver serving dish that would traditionally hold potatoes, according to Richard Halpern, but Bennett describes this as a covered casserole dish. The servings are less prominent than the presentation of white linen, white plates and water-filled glasses. The people in the painting are not yet eating, and the painting contrasts the empty plates and vacant space in their midst with images of overabundance.|$|E
2500|$|The Christmas {{menu for}} the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. [...] Paul Railway in 1882 listed the {{following}} items: Hunter's Soup, Salmon with Hollandaise Sauce, Boned Pheasant in Aspic Jelly, Chicken Salad, Salmis Prairie Chicken, Oyster Patties, Rice Croquette, Roast Beef, English Ribs of Beef, Turkey with <b>Cranberry</b> <b>Sauce,</b> Stuffed Suckling Pig with Applesauce, Antelope Steak with Currant Jelly, potatoes, green peas, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, Mince Pie, Plum Pudding, Cake, Ice Cream, Fruits and coffee.|$|E
2500|$|Mashed {{potatoes}} with gravy, sweet potatoes, <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce,</b> sweet corn, various fall vegetables, squash, and pumpkin pie are {{commonly associated with}} Thanksgiving dinner. Green bean casserole was introduced in 1955 and remains a favorite. All of these are actually native to the Americas or were introduced as a new food source to the Europeans when they arrived. Turkey may be an exception. In his book Mayflower, Nathaniel Philbrick suggests that the Pilgrims might already have been familiar with turkey in England, even though the bird is native to the Americas. The Spaniards had brought domesticated turkeys back from Central America in the early 17th century, and the birds soon became popular fare all over Europe, including England, where turkey (as {{an alternative to the}} traditional goose) became a [...] "fixture at English Christmases". The Pilgrims did not observe Christmas.|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't {{laugh at}} him, but tell him {{all about it}} if you can," [...] said Mrs. Bhaer, consoling Rob with more <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b> for the general smile that went round the table at his mistake.|$|E
60|$|After {{the first}} course of raw oysters, came some cream of celery soup with relishes, and then some roast turkey with <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b> and vegetables. After that the young folks had various kinds of dessert with hot chocolate, and then nuts with raisins.|$|E
60|$|When noon came {{they opened}} the Fox-King's basket of luncheon, and found a nice roasted turkey with <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b> and some slices of bread and butter. As {{they sat on the}} grass by the {{roadside}} the shaggy man cut up the turkey with his pocket-knife and passed slices of it around.|$|E
6000|$|... "If he'd {{try to do}} one of my tricks {{long enough}} he'd get so that there wouldn't hardly {{anything}} choke him," [...] the sword swallower ventured to suggest, mildly, as he wiped a small stream of <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b> from his chin and laid a well polished turkey bone {{by the side of}} his plate.|$|E
60|$|I {{just threw}} myself {{heart and soul}} into the {{preparations}} for that dinner. I had three turkeys and two sucking pigs, and mince pies and pumpkin pies and apple pies, and doughnuts and fruit cake and <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b> and brown bread, and ever {{so many other things}} to fill up the chinks. The night before Thanksgiving everything was ready, and I was so tired I could hardly talk to Jimmy Nelson when he dropped in.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh dear! why can't boys play {{without making}} such a mess," [...] sighed Molly, picking up the {{feathers}} from the duster with which Boo {{had been trying to}} make a [...] "cocky-doo" [...] of the hapless dog. [...] "I'll wash him right after dinner, and that will keep him out of mischief for a while," [...] she thought, as the young engineer unsuspiciously proceeded to ornament his already crocky countenance with squash, <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce,</b> and gravy, till he looked more like a Fiji chief in full war-paint than a Christian boy.|$|E
60|$|With a loud {{flourish}} {{from the}} musicians all took their {{places at the}} festive mushroom, and the banquet began. The dishes were sufficiently various to tempt even an anchorite to excess, for all the delicacies of the season were there. Ladybird soup, baked stickleback, roasted leg of nightingale, boiled shoulder of frog with <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce,</b> wild strawberry tarts, and numerous kinds of fruits and juices, made up a dainty repast, of which king, queen, and courtiers partook heartily. The band, the members of which were perched in the swinging flowers of a foxglove close by, played lustily during the feast.|$|E
60|$|Every one laughed, {{and after}} the gentleman had made a despairing {{flourish}} over them with a carving-knife in emulation of Mr. Makely's emblematic attempt upon the turkey, both were taken away and carved at a sideboard. They were then served in slices, the turkey with <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce,</b> and the ducks with currant jelly; and I noticed that no one took {{so much of the}} turkey that he could not suffer himself to be helped also to the duck. I must tell you that there a salad with the duck, and after that there was an ice-cream, with fruit and all manner of candied fruits, and candies, different kinds of cheese, coffee, and liqueurs to drink after the coffee.|$|E
60|$|It was a noble dinner! As I {{regard it}} from the {{standpoint}} of today, with potatoes six dollars per bushel and turkeys forty cents per pound, it all seems part of a kindlier world, a vanished world--as it is! There were squashes and turnips and <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b> and pumpkin pie and mince pie, (made under mother's supervision) and coffee with real cream,--all the things which are so precious now, and the talk was in praise of the delicious food and the Exposition which was just closing, and reports of the crops which were abundant and safely garnered. The wars of the world were all behind us and the nation on its way back to prosperity--and we were unafraid.|$|E
6000|$|... "It must be owned, Hugh," [...] said my uncle, as he {{finished}} his soup that day, [...] "one may live quite comfortably in Paris, if he possess the savoir vivre. Nevertheless, I have {{a strong desire to}} get a taste of native air. One may say and think what he pleases about the Paris pleasures, and the Paris cuisine, and all that sort of thing: but 'home is home, be it ever so homely.' A 'd'Inde aux truffes' is capital eating; so is a turkey with <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce.</b> I sometimes think I could fancy even a pumpkin pie, though there is not a fragment of the rock of Plymouth in the granite of my frame." ...|$|E
6000|$|All the {{relations}} in the neighborhood had come to dinner, and then [...] gone back to their own houses, but some of {{the relations}} had come from [...] a distance, and these had to stay all night at the grandfather's. But [...] whether they went or whether they stayed, they all told the [...] grandmother that they did believe it was the best Thanksgiving dinner [...] they had ever eaten in their born days. They had had <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce,</b> [...] and they'd had mashed potato, and they'd had mince-pie and pandowdy, [...] and they'd had celery, and they'd had Hubbard squash, and they'd had [...] tea and coffee both, and they'd had apple-dumpling with hard sauce, [...] and they'd had hot biscuit and sweet pickle, and mangoes, and frosted [...] cake, and nuts, and cauliflower-- ...|$|E
60|$|The smiling {{family were}} {{gathered}} round the hospitable board. The table was plenteously laid with a soup-plate {{in front of}} each beaming child, a bucket of hot water before the radiant mother, and {{at the head of the}} board the Christmas dinner of the happy home, warmly covered by a thimble and resting on a poker chip. The expectant whispers of the little ones were hushed as the father, rising from his chair, lifted the thimble and disclosed a small pill of concentrated nourishment on the chip before him. Christmas turkey, <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce,</b> plum pudding, mince pie--it was all there, all jammed into that little pill and only waiting to expand. Then the father with deep reverence, and a devout eye alternating between the pill and heaven, lifted his voice in a benediction.|$|E
6000|$|Thanksgiving {{came and}} went in another storm. The snow was so deep that {{getting away from the}} Hall was out of the question, so those who had planned to go home for the holiday were {{somewhat}} disappointed. But Captain Putnam provided good cheer in abundance, with plenty of turkey and <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce,</b> pumpkin pie and nuts. For the evening the boys got up an entertainment in the assembly room, with monologues and dialogues, and also some singing by the school Glee Club, and some very good violin and mandolin playing. Pepper, Jack and Andy took part in the entertainment, and everybody but Josiah Crabtree enjoyed the exhibition. Crabtree did not believe in such [...] "tomfoolery," [...] as he expressed it, and told Captain Putnam the cadets should have given a Shakespearian recital, or something like that, instead.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, pshaw, now, mate, you think!" [...] pleaded the other. [...] "I'll {{take any}} sort of a job; I don't care what it is. I ain't got any o' that false modesty about me. Been round too much. And I don't {{want to go back}} to the Wayfarer's Lodge. It's a good place, and I know my welcome's warm and waitin' for me, between two hot plates; but the thing of it is, it's demoralisin'. That's what the {{chaplain}} said just afore I left the--ship, 'n' I promised him I'd give work a try, anyway. Now you just think up something! I ain't in any hurry." [...] In proof he threw his soft hat on the desk, and took up one of the menus. [...] "This your bill of fare? Well, it ain't bad! Vurmiselly soup, boiled holibut, roast beef, roast turkey with <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce,</b> roast pork with apple sauce, chicken corquettes, ditto patties, three kinds of pie; bread puddin', both kinds of sauce; ice cream, nuts, and coffee. Why, mate!" ...|$|E
60|$|And doctors, cooks {{certainly}} are, {{the very}} best medicos in the world; for what pestilent pills and potions of the Faculty are half so serviceable to man, and health-and-strength-giving, as roasted lamb and green peas, say, in spring; and roast beef and <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b> in winter? Will a dose of calomel and jakp do you as much good? Will a bolus build up a fainting man? Is there any satisfaction in dining off a powder? But these doctors of the frying-pan sometimes loll men off by a surfeit; or give them the headache, at least. Well, what then? No matter. For if with their most goodly and ten times jolly I medicines, they now and then fill our nights with tribulations, and abridge our days, what of the social homicides perpetrated by the Faculty? And when you die by a pill-doctor's hands, it is never with a sweet relish in your mouth, as though you died by a frying-pan-doctor; but your last breath villainously savors of ipecac and rhubarb. Then, what charges they make for the abominable lunches they serve out so stingily! One of their bills for boluses would keep you in good dinners a twelve-month.|$|E

60|$|The landlady {{was such}} an indistinct quality, that it could seldom be known whether she was at home or not, {{and when she was}} identifiably present, whether she had promised or had not promised to do this or that. People were always trying to see her for some reason or no reason, and it was said that the best time to find her was at table. This was not so easy; the meals had a certain range in time, and the landlady was {{nominally}} {{at the head of the}} table; but those who came early to find her made the mistake of not having come late, and if you came late you just missed her. Yet she was sometimes actually to be encountered at the head of the stairs from the kitchen, or evanescing from the parlor; and somehow the house was operated; the meals came and went, and the smell of their coming and going filled the hall-way from the ground floor to the attic. Some people complained of the meals, but Cornelia's traditions were so simple that she thought them a constant succession of prodigies, with never less than steak, fish and hash for breakfast, and always turkey and <b>cranberry</b> <b>sauce</b> for dinner, and often ice-cream; sometimes the things were rather burnt, but she did not see that there was much to find fault with. She celebrated the luxury in her letters home, and she said that she liked the landlady, too, and that they had got to be great friends; in fact the landlady reminded the girl of her own mother in the sort of springless effectiveness with which she brought things to pass, when you would never have expected any result whatever; and she was gentle like her mother, and simple-hearted, with all her elusiveness. But she was not neat, like Mrs. Saunders; the house went at loose ends. Cornelia found fluff under her bed that must have been there a long time. The parlor and the dining-room were kept darkened, and no one could have told what mysteries their corners and set pieces of furniture harbored. The carpets, where the subdued light struck them, betrayed places worn down to the warp. Mrs. Montgomery herself had a like effect of unsparing use; her personal upholstery showed frayed edges and broken woofs, which did not seriously discord with her nerveless gentility.|$|E
