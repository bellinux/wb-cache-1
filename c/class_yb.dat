40|$|Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), {{a family}} of {{ubiquitous}} cytosolic isozymes, catalyze the detoxification of electrophilic substrates with reduced glutathione and participate in intracellular binding and transport of lipophilic substances. This study measured GST activity biochemically in the inner ear of the rat; determined the isozyme profile by Western blotting; and identified, immunohistochemically. {{the distribution of the}} [mu] and [pi] class GSTs in the organ of Corti. GST enzymatic activity in inner ear tissues ranged from 117 to 348 nmoles glutathione converted/min/mg protein, values somewhat higher than those found in brain (130) and much lower than in liver (1011). Of the GST isoforms, the [pi] class (identified by antibodies against the Yp subunit) was most prominent, the [mu] <b>class</b> (<b>Yb</b> 1 subunit) clearly evident while the [alpha] class (Ya subunit) was barely detectable on Western blots. Immunocytochemical analysis showed differential distribution of the Yh 1 and Yp subunits. The Yb 1 subunit was present in the sensory cells, while supporting cells were not specifically stained. At the subcellular level, the isozyme was localized in the apical zones of inner (IHCs) and outer hair cells (OHCs) close to the cuticular plate. The extent of staining, however, varied between OHCs and IHCs. In the OHCs, staining appeared in discrete spots in the apical areas only, whereas in IHCs staining extended further towards the center of the cells. The Yp subunit was mainly localized to Deiters cell processes and pillar cells. Both Yb 1 and Yp colocalized with tubulin-specific antibody. The functional significance of GST in the cochlear receptor cells is speculative. However, a role anologous to that in other tissues (detoxification, prostaglandin synthesis) can be assumed. In addition, an association of GST with the microtubule system is possible based on immunohistochemical colocalization with tubulin...|$|E

40|$|A {{specific}} biochemical phenotype {{is expressed}} during chemical hepatocardnogenesis, which includes increased {{activity of the}} various isoenzyme forms of glutathione S-transferase (GST) composed of class alpha (Ya/Yc), <b>class</b> mu (<b>Yb)</b> and <b>class</b> pi (Yp) gene products. In vitro cell lines of normal and chemically transformed rat liver epithelial cells {{provide an opportunity to}} examine the regulation of expression of GST isoenzymes. We have studied the effect of the state of proliferation in culture on both the enzymic activity and the isoenzyme-specific niRNA expression. In normal rat liver epithelial cells (WB-F 344), basal expression of the Yp subunit decreases, and of the Yb subunit increases, in cells at confluence compared with those in logarithmic-phase growth. In a subline of WB-F 344 cells that has been chemically treated in vitro (GN 6), there was greater Yp expression; however, the effect o...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{detailed}} spectroscopic {{study of}} Yb 3 + :CaF 2 {{is made by}} using laser selective excitation, low-temperature time-resolved fluorescence, and Raman techniques. Three dominant types of Yb 3 + isolated ion centers are identified at very low (0. 03 at. %) dopant concentration: two of them with cubic and tetragonal symmetries and the third one not clearly identified but likely of trigonal symmetry. Fluorescence decays strongly differ from one site to another. The overall measured positions of the Stark sublevels of the 2 F 7  2 and 2 F 5  2 multiplets are satisfactorily explained by the crystal-field calculations. On the other hand, at higher dopant concentrations, only one dominant <b>class</b> of <b>Yb</b> 3 + centers occurs which corresponds to some hexameric cluster in which the Yb 3 + ions site in nearly tetragonal crystal-field environments and whose energy-level positions are discussed and compared with those previously reported in the literature...|$|R
40|$|The sex-dependent {{expression}} and growth hormone (GH) regulation of rat liver glutathione S-transferase (GST) was examined using oligonucleotide probes that distinguish between closely related class Alpha (Ya 1, Ya 2, Yc) and <b>class</b> Mu (<b>Yb</b> 1, Yb 2, Yb 3) GST mRNAs [Waxman, Sundseth, Srivastava and Lapenson (1992) Cancer Res. 52, 5797 - 5802]. Northern-blot {{analysis revealed that}} the steady-state levels of GST Ya 1, Yb 1 and Yb 2 mRNAs are 2. 5 - 3 -fold higher in male as compared with female rat liver. In contrast, GST Yc and Ya 2 mRNAs were expressed at a 2 - 3 -fold higher level in female rat liver. Microsomal GST mRNA did not exhibit significant sex-dependent differences in rat liver. Treatment of male rats with GH by continuous infusion suppressed expression of the male-dominant GST Ya 1, Yb 1 and Yb 2 mRNAs to levels at or below those found in female rat liver. This suppressive effect of GH was liver-specific, insofar as GH treatment did not alter kidney GST Ya 1 mRNA levels. Hypophysectomy increased expression of the male-dominant GSTs, particularly in female rats (e. g. 8 -fold elevation of GST Ya 1 mRNA). GST Yc mRNA was increased approx. 2 -fold in hypophysectomized males, indicating that this mRNA is subject to negative regulation {{by one or more}} pituitary-dependent factors. Continuous GH treatment of the hypophysectomized rats suppressed the expression of mRNA of GSTs Ya 1, Yb 1 and Yb 2 when given as a continuous infusion, but not when given by an intermittent (twice daily) GH-injection schedule. Combination of continuous exposure to GH with thyroxine treatment resulted in a more complete suppression of GSTs Ya 1, Yb 1 and Yb 2. In contrast, thyroxine increased the expression of GST Yc in hypophysectomized rats. These studies establish that several Alpha and Mu class GSTs are expressed in a sex-dependent fashion in adult rat liver, where they are regulated by multiple pituitary-dependent hormones through pretranslational mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|The AZn_ 2 Sb_ 2 (P¯ 3 m 1, A = Ca, Sr, Eu, <b>Yb)</b> <b>class</b> of Zintl {{compounds}} {{has shown}} high thermoelectric efficiency (zT ~ 1) {{and is an}} appealing system {{for the development of}} Zintl structure–property relationships. High temperature transport measurements have previously been conducted for all known compositions except for SrZn_ 2 Sb_ 2; here we characterize polycrystalline SrZn_ 2 Sb_ 2 to 723 K and review the transport behavior of the other compounds in this class. Consistent with the known AZn_ 2 Sb_ 2 compounds, SrZn_ 2 Sb_ 2 is found to be a hole-doped semiconductor with a thermal band gap ~ 0. 27 eV. The Seebeck coefficients of the AZn 2 Sb 2 compounds are found to be described by similar effective mass (m* ~ 0. 6 m_e). Electronic structure calculations reveal similar m* is due to antimony p states at the valence band edge which are largely unaffected by the choice of A-site species. However, the choice of A-site element has a dramatic effect on the hole mobility, with the room temperature mobility of the rare earth-based compositions approximately double that found for Ca and Sr on the A site. This difference in mobility is examined in the context of electronic structure calculations...|$|R
