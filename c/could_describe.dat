5|$|In 1917, D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson (1860–1948) {{published}} his book On Growth and Form. His description of phyllotaxis and the Fibonacci sequence, the mathematical {{relationships in the}} spiral growth patterns of plants, is classic. He showed that simple equations <b>could</b> <b>describe</b> all the apparently complex spiral growth patterns of animal horns and mollusc shells.|$|E
5|$|The player {{would sit}} at the stand and press the buttons to make their moves, while one panel of lights showed {{the state of the}} game, and another showed the computer's {{calculations}} during its move. The computer could be set to make its calculations at various speeds, slowing down so that the demonstrator <b>could</b> <b>describe</b> exactly what the computer was doing in real time. A visual guide attached to the Nimrod explained what the computer was doing during its turn, as well as showing possible game states and how they would be represented by the lights. Signs stating which player's turn it was and whether one or the other had won would light up as appropriate during gameplay.|$|E

25|$|Information from {{religious}} sources {{is limited by}} a system of traditional restrictions on what they <b>could</b> <b>describe</b> and depict. The murder of the god Osiris, for instance, is never explicitly described in Egyptian writings. The Egyptians believed that words and images could affect reality, so they avoided the risk of making such negative events real. The conventions of Egyptian art were also poorly suited for portraying whole narratives, so most myth-related artwork consists of sparse individual scenes.|$|E
25|$|This {{purchase}} {{paved the}} way for the founding of the village at Bergen (Bergen Square). Permission was granted by Stuyvesant to the establish a village; the town was officially settled in 1660. There are various opinions as to the origin of the name given by the European settlers. Some say that it so called for any of number of towns in the Netherlands or the city in Norway Others believe it comes from the word bergen, which in the Germanic languages of northern Europe means hills, and <b>could</b> <b>describe</b> a most distinct geological feature of the region, The Palisades. Yet another interpretation is that it comes from the Dutch word bergen, meaning to save or to recover, prompted by the settlers' return after they had fled attacks by the native population.|$|E
25|$|The {{motion of}} a body can only be {{described}} relative to something elseother bodies, observers, or a set of space-time coordinates. These are called frames of reference. If the coordinates are chosen badly, the laws of motion may be more complex than necessary. For example, suppose a free body that has no external forces acting on it is at rest at some instant. In many coordinate systems, it would begin to move at the next instant, even though there are no forces on it. However, a frame of reference can always be chosen in which it remains stationary. Similarly, if space is not described uniformly or time independently, a coordinate system <b>could</b> <b>describe</b> the simple flight of a free body in space as a complicated zig-zag in its coordinate system. Indeed, an intuitive summary of inertial frames can be given as: In an inertial reference frame, the laws of mechanics take their simplest form.|$|E

Despite investment in the castle declining, the antiquarian John Leland <b>could</b> <b>describe</b> the new keep in the early 16th century as being [...] "the glory of the castle, both large and fair and very strong, both by works and by the site of it".|$|E
500|$|The A. A. Rayner Funeral Home in Chicago {{received}} Till's body. Upon arrival, Bradley {{insisted on}} viewing {{it to make}} a positive identification, later stating that the stench from it was noticeable two blocks away.

[...] Tens {{of thousands of people}} lined the street outside the mortuary to view Till's body, and days later thousands more attended his funeral at Roberts Temple Church of God in Christ.|$|E
500|$|In a {{more secular}} appreciation, one of Eliot's biographers, the critic Peter Ackroyd, {{has stated that}} [...] "the most {{striking}} characteristic of The Four Quartets {{is the way in}} which these sequences are very carefully structured. They echo and re-echo each other, and one sequence in each poem, as it were, echoes its companion sequence in the next poem[...] [...] The Four Quartets are poems about a nation and about a culture which is very severely under threat, and in a sense, you <b>could</b> <b>describe</b> The Four Quartets as a poem of memory, but not the memory of one individual but the memory of a whole civilization." ...|$|E

500|$|Metal Storm {{reviewed}} the DVD {{recording of the}} live performance and called it [...] "a perfect way to discover the music of Wednesday 13 that I <b>could</b> <b>describe</b> as a mix of Glam with Punk". Justin Donnelly {{reviewed the}} album for The Metal Forge and wrote favorably about the DVD portion: [...] "Shot with six cameras, Fuck It, We'll Do It Live is a raw and honest representation of Wednesday 13 live in concert". A review by Metal Rage was critical of the DVD, but praised the audio on the CD: [...] "All in all I definitely recommend the CD, 'cause you get a nice representative image of what a good Wednesday 13 show sounds like." ...|$|E
500|$|... "A Short Story About Love" [...] was co-written by {{executive}} producer J.H. Wyman and co-producer Graham Roland. Wyman {{stated that the}} episode had [...] "scary" [...] and [...] "romantic" [...] themes, and as the title indicated, was [...] "all about motivation. Love is a great motivator, for good and evil." [...] He and fellow executive producer Jeff Pinkner believed the episode was [...] "kind of like a perfect version of what a Fringe show is," [...] because it depicted [...] "fringy" [...] elements {{in the form of}} killings while using love and relationships as central plot drivers. Wyman added that it was a [...] "culmination of what I <b>could</b> <b>describe</b> as — it’s a direction where we’ve been heading and I think the fans will be really happy and satisfied." ...|$|E
500|$|Hemingway biographer Carlos Baker {{writes that}} Hemingway {{learned from his}} short stories how to [...] "get the most from the least, how to prune language, how to {{multiply}} intensities, and how to tell {{nothing but the truth}} in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth". The style has become known as the iceberg theory, because, as Baker describes it, in Hemingway's writing the hard facts float above water while the supporting structure, including the symbolism, operates out of sight. Benson believes Hemingway used autobiographical details as framing devices to write about life in general—not only his life. The concept of the iceberg theory is sometimes referred to as the [...] "theory of omission". Hemingway believed the writer <b>could</b> <b>describe</b> one thing though an entirely different thing occurs below the surface.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the novel}} is written in a journalistic style, Frederic Svoboda writes that the {{striking}} thing about the work is [...] "how quickly it moves away from a simple recounting of events." [...] Jackson Benson believes that Hemingway used autobiographical details as framing devices for life in general. For example, Benson says that Hemingway drew out his experiences with [...] "what if" [...] scenarios: [...] "what if I were wounded {{in such a way}} that I could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?" [...] Hemingway believed that the writer <b>could</b> <b>describe</b> one thing while an entirely different thing occurs below the surface—an approach he called the iceberg theory, or the theory of omission.|$|E
500|$|... "Can't Be Tamed" [...] was co-written by Cyrus, Antonina Armato and Tim James, {{who also}} {{produced}} the track. According to Cyrus, the track's moral is to free yourself from any biding or hindrance, in particular application to women. Cyrus said the song's message applies to different situations. Personally to her, [...] "it is {{about being a}} cage and people looking at you." [...] As for others, she believed it <b>could</b> <b>describe</b> high school, {{in a situation where}} [...] "someone feeling they have to be one way to be with a clique {{and they want to be}} who they are. A relationship, or whatever, it is just breaking out and feeling free." [...] Hollywood Records described [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] as [...] "a self-empowering song in which Miley asserts that she has to stay true to herself in relationships".|$|E
500|$|Besides his further general remarks, Hazlitt lingers appreciatively over {{a number}} of amusing scenes and poetic passages, {{including}} the songs, all showing how [...] "Shakespear's comedy is of a pastoral and poetical cast. Folly is indigenous to the soil [...] Absurdity has every encouragement afforded it; and nonsense has room to flourish in." [...] Characters of vastly different types are all welcome and fit into his scheme: [...] "the same house is big enough to hold Malvolio, the Countess, Maria, Sir Toby, and Sir Andrew Ague-cheek." [...] He particularly admires the character of Viola, whom Shakespeare gives many speeches of [...] "impassioned sweetness". Characterising the play as a whole by quoting the author's own words in it—"Shakespear alone <b>could</b> <b>describe</b> the effect of his own poetry."—he reflects that the play's poetry comes o'er the ear like the sweet south/That breathes upon a bank of violets,/Stealing and giving odour.|$|E

500|$|The {{scabrous}} lyrics—"God {{save the}} Queen/She ain't no human being/There is no future/In England's dreaming"—prompted widespread outcry. Several major chains refused to stock the single. It was banned {{not only by}} the BBC but also by every independent radio station, making it the [...] "most heavily censored record in British history". That week, there was no number 1 hit in Britain, according to Lydon, et al. in The Filth and The Fury; the top spot was empty, because so many radio stations, the BBC, and individuals protested the song's content. Rotten boasted, [...] "We're the only honest band that's hit this planet in about two thousand million years." [...] Jones shrugged off everything the song stated and implied—or took nihilism to a logical endpoint: [...] "I don't see how anyone <b>could</b> <b>describe</b> us as a political band. I don't even know the name of the Prime Minister." [...] The song, and its public impact, are now recognised as [...] "punk's crowning glory".|$|E
500|$|Because {{he began}} as a writer of short stories, Baker {{believes}} Hemingway learned to [...] "get the most from the least, how to prune language, how to multiply intensities and how to tell {{nothing but the truth}} in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth." [...] Hemingway called his style the Iceberg Theory: the facts float above water; the supporting structure and symbolism operate out of sight. The concept of the iceberg theory is sometimes referred to as the [...] "theory of omission". Hemingway believed the writer <b>could</b> <b>describe</b> one thing (such as Nick Adams fishing in [...] "The Big Two-Hearted River") though an entirely different thing occurs below the surface (Nick Adams concentrating on fishing {{to the extent that he}} does not have to think about anything else). [...] Paul Smith writes that Hemingway's first stories, collected as In Our Time, showed he was still experimenting with his writing style. He avoided complicated syntax. About 70 percent of the sentences are simple sentences—a childlike syntax without subordination.|$|E
500|$|Choe's {{comments}} are valuable to historians seeking {{to better understand}} Chinese culture and civilization in the 15th century; for example, historians' seeking for clues about how widespread literacy was in China, Choe's comment [...] "even village children, ferrymen, and sailors" [...] were able to read serves as a valuable piece of evidence. Moreover, Choe asserted that they <b>could</b> <b>describe</b> for him the mountains, rivers, old ruins, and other places in their regions, along with the significance of dynastic changes. Choe also bothered to list items such as the generous provisions provided by regional commanders, which included in one instance a plate of pork, two ducks, four chickens, two fish, one beaker of wine, one plate of rice, one plate of walnuts, one plate of vegetables, one plate of bamboo shoots, one plate of wheat noodles, one plate of jujube fruit, and one plate of bean curd. Although he was offered wine in China, Choe asserts in his diary that he rejected the offer due to the continuing three-year mourning period for his late father. In addition to wine, he stated that he also abstained from eating [...] "meat, garlic, oniony plants, or sweet things". This strict adherence to Confucian principles by a Korean pleased his Chinese hosts.|$|E
