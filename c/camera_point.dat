40|$|This paper {{presents}} a general strategy for assembling mosaics from numerous individual images where uncertainty {{exists in the}} position and orientation of those images. Both of the presented applications relate to remotely operated camera platforms, the first being the Galileo solid state imaging (SSI) camera presently in orbit around Jupiter, and the second being the Imager for Mars Pathfinder (IMP) stereo camera on Mars. A basic strategy in both applications {{is to determine the}} correct relative <b>camera</b> <b>pointing</b> followed by direct map projection of the images. It is assumed that approximate <b>camera</b> <b>pointing</b> exists sufficient to locate adjacent images and to place initial tiepoints within reach of the correlator. Spatial correlation is used to fix tiepoints whose initial locations are predicted by the <b>camera</b> <b>pointing.</b> We use either an fast fourier transform (fft) algorithm or a variant of Gruen's scheme permitting limited image rotation and skew. The Gruen correlator has three hierarchical modes: 1) A classical spatial least squares correlation on integral pixel boundaries used when rotation is small. 2) An annealing non-deterministic search used when rotations are unknown. A simplex deterministic search used for the end game. The correlation operation can be performed either interactively or autonomously. The final <b>camera</b> <b>pointing</b> solution relies upon a simplex downhill search in 2 n or 3 n dimensions where n is the number of images comprising the mosaic and the objective function to be minimized is the disagreement between tiepoint locations predicted from the <b>camera</b> <b>pointing</b> with those observed by the correlator. For Galileo the 3 n unknowns are euler angles defining <b>camera</b> <b>pointing</b> in planet coordinates, and for Mars Pathfinder they are 2 n unknowns representing commanded azimuth and elevation in the Lander coordinate system...|$|R

We give a calibration method whose focus is learning the mapping from time delays between pairs of microphones to the associated pan and tilt a PTZ-camera should be given to point at. This curtails the need to explicitly learn the microphone and camera positions.

We develop a two-stage approach to recover the scene depth and high resolution textures of the reflected and transmitted layers.

For recovering high resolution textures, we assume that the scene is composed of planar regions and perform the reconstruction of each layer by using an explicit form of the plenoptic <b>camera</b> <b>point</b> spread function. The proposed framework also recovers the sharp scene texture with different motion blurs applied to each layer. We demonstrate our method on challenging real and synthetic images.

40|$|Abstract â€” This paper {{describes}} a technique for the estima-tion of the translational and rotational velocities of a miniature helicopter using the video signals {{from a single}} onboard camera. For every two consecutive frames from the <b>camera,</b> <b>point</b> correspondences are identified and Epipolar Geometry based algorithms are used to find the likely estimates of the absolute rotations and relative displacements. Images from onboard camera are often corrupted with various types of noises; SIFT descriptors {{were found to be}} the best feature descriptors to be used for point correspondences. To speed up the processing, we introduce a new representation of these descriptors based on compressive sensing formalisms. To estimate the absolute displacement of the helicopter between frames, we use the measurements from a simulated IR sensor to find the true change in altitude of the body frame, scaling other translational dimensions accordingly, and later estimating the velocities. Experiments conducted using data from a real helicopter in an indoor environment demonstrate promising results. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract â€“ This paper {{presents}} three technical {{elements that}} we have developed to improve {{the accuracy of the}} visual target tracking for single-sol approach-and-instrument placement in future Mars rover missions. An accurate, straightforward method of rover mast calibration is achieved by using a total station, a camera calibration target, and four prism targets mounted on the rover. The method was applied to Rocky 8 rover mast calibration and yielded a 1. 1 -pixel rms residual error. <b>Camera</b> <b>pointing</b> requires inverse kinematic solutions for mast pan and tilt angles such that the target image appears right {{at the center of the}} camera image. Two issues were raised. Mast camera frames are in general not parallel to the masthead base frame. Further, the optical axis of the camera model in general does not pass through the center of the image. Despite these issues, we managed to derive non-iterative closed-form exact solutions, which were verified with Matlab routines. Actual <b>camera</b> <b>pointing</b> experiments over 50 random target image points yielded less than 1. 3 -pixel rms pointing error. Finally, a purely geometric method for camera handoff using stereo views of the target has been developed. Experimental test runs show less than 2. 5 pixels error on high-resolution Navcam for Pancam-to-Navcam handoff, and less than 4 pixels error on lower-resolution Hazcam for Navcam-to-Hazcam handoff.
