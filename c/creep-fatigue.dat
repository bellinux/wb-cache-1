40|$|Abstract. The {{application}} of nondestructive evaluation to <b>creep-fatigue</b> damage was {{examined in this}} paper. Generally, as the hold time of static load increases, the degradation of material becomes more rapid and the <b>creep-fatigue</b> life decreases. Therefore, {{in the evaluation of}} <b>creep-fatigue</b> strength and life of high-pressure vessel such as main steam pipe at high temperature is very important in power plants. In this study, the <b>creep-fatigue</b> behavior of P 92 steel was evaluated nondestructively by the backscattered ultrasound using the <b>creep-fatigue</b> specimens. The results obtained by Rayleigh surface wave of backscattered ultrasound were compared and analyzed with the experimental parameters. Also, the relation between the SDA (slope of degraded area) and <b>creep-fatigue</b> life was examined. From the result of nondestructive test, we suggest that SDA would be used as the new parameter for the evaluation of <b>creep-fatigue</b> damage. As the degradation increased, the SDA decreased and also the <b>creep-fatigue</b> life decreased...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Creep-fatigue</b> {{tests were}} carried out to study <b>creep-fatigue</b> {{property}} of P 91 steel in many references. There {{are two kinds of}} loading control methods. One is controlled by stress, and the other is controlled by strain. In this study the <b>creep-fatigue</b> test data loading controlled by stress are summarized. Based on these data Supported Vector Machine(SVM) method is used to build up the models to predict the <b>creep-fatigue</b> lifetime of P 91 steel. The results show SVM method can be used to predict the <b>creep-fatigue</b> life of P 91 steel, and the value of insensitive factor is very important. When the value of insensitive factor is small and the training error of the model is small too, but the prediction ability decreases. On the contrary when insensitive factor is increased, the training error will become large, and the prediction ability will increase. So during the training, mean square error should not be regarded as the unique goal function...|$|E

40|$|Background—The <b>creep-fatigue</b> {{properties}} {{of stainless steel}} 316 are of interest because of the wide use of this material in demanding service environments, such as the nuclear industry. Need—A number of models exist to describe <b>creep-fatigue</b> behaviours, but they are limited {{by the need to}} obtain specialized coefficients from a large number of experiments, which are time-consuming and expensive. Also, they do not generalise to other situations of temperature and frequency. There is a need for improved formulations for <b>creep-fatigue,</b> with coefficients that determinable directly from the existing and simple <b>creep-fatigue</b> tests and creep rupture tests. Outcomes—A unified <b>creep-fatigue</b> equation is proposed, based on an extension of the Coffin-Manson equation, to introduce dependencies on temperature and frequency. The equation may be formulated for strain as ε p = C 0 c (T, t, ε p) N − β 0, or as a power-law ε p = C 0 c (T, t) N − β 0 b (T, t). These were then validated against existing experimental data. The equations provide an excellent fit to data (r 2 = 0. 97 or better). Originality—This work develops a novel formulation for <b>creep-fatigue</b> that accommodates temperature and frequency. The coefficients can be obtained with minimum experimental effort, being based on standard rather than specialized tests...|$|E

For in-vessel components of fusion reactors the material EUROFER 97 is a candidate for structural application where it is subjected to irradiation and cyclic thermo-mechanical loads. To be able to evaluate fusion reactor components reliably, <b>creep-fatigue</b> damage has to be taken into account. In the frame of Engineering Data and Design Integration (EDDI) in EUROfusion Technology Work Programme rapid and easy design evaluation is very important to predict the critical regions under typical fusion reactor loading conditions. The presented <b>Creep-Fatigue</b> Assessment (CFA) tool is based on the <b>creep-fatigue</b> rules in ASME Boiler Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC) Section 3 Division 1 Subsection NH which was adapted to the material EUROFER 97 and developed for ANSYS. The CFA tool uses the local stress, maximum elastic strain range and temperature from the elastic analysis of the component performed with ANSYS. For the assessment design fatigue and stress to rupture curves of EUROFER 97 as well as isochronous stress vs. strain curves determined by a constitutive model considering irradiation influence are used to deal with <b>creep-fatigue</b> damage.

The large reduction in {{the magnitude of the}} velocity in 10 min hold <b>creep-fatigue</b> sample is attributed to the combined or individual effect of increased amount of inelastic deformation, creep damage and oxidation.

40|$|Design codes, such as RCC-MRx and ASME III NH, for {{generation}} IV {{nuclear reactors}} use interaction diagram based method for <b>creep-fatigue</b> assessment. In the interaction diagram the fatigue damage is expressed as {{the ratio of}} design cycles over the allowable amount of cycles in service and the creep damage as the ratio of time in service over the design life. With this approach {{it is assumed that}} these quantities can be added linearly to represent the combined <b>creep-fatigue</b> damage accumulation. Failure is assumed to occur when the sum of the damage reaches a specified value, usually unity or less. The fatigue damage fraction should naturally be unity when no creep damage is present and creep damage should be unity when no fatigue damage is present. However, strict fatigue limits and safety factors used for creep rupture strengths as well as different approaches to relaxation calculation can cause a situation where <b>creep-fatigue</b> test data plotted according to the design rules are three orders of magnitude away from the interaction diagram unity line. Thus, utilizing the interaction diagram methods for predicting the number of <b>creep-fatigue</b> cycles may be inaccurate and from design point of view these methods may be overly conservative. In this paper the results of <b>creep-fatigue</b> tests carried out for austenitic stainless steel 316 and heat resistant ferritic-martensitic steel P 91, which are included in the RCC-MRx and ASME III NH design codes, are assessed using the interaction diagram method with different levels of criteria for the creep and fatigue fractions. The test results are also compared against the predictions of a recently developed simplified <b>creep-fatigue</b> model which predicts the <b>creep-fatigue</b> damage as a function of strain range, temperature and hold period duration with little amount of fitting parameters.

Experimental results were somewhat scattered since sensitive characteristics of acoustic emission method. However, their empirical relation indicated that counts rate correlated with fracture mechanics parameter. Finally, acoustic emission application was extended to the <b>creep-fatigue</b> interaction at elevated temperature. Emission response under each damage mode was compared and characterized. Based on these characteristics, <b>creep-fatigue</b> interaction was evaluated by use of acoustic emission parameter. Overall investigations concluded acoustic emission is very effective tool of fatigue assessment...|$|E

Stress and strain fields are first analysed {{at the tip of}} a static crack subjected to <b>creep-fatigue</b> loading, assuming an elasto-viscoplastic single crystal behaviour model. Local ratchetting effects are observed, depending on the distance from the crack-tip. <b>Creep-fatigue</b> loadings are compared with pure fatigue and pure creep loadings. The significant differences are pointed out, especially stress relaxation and amount of plastic slip. These results will be useful {{for the development of a}} new life prediction tool, based on local approach to fracture...|$|E
