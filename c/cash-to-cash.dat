40|$|We {{study the}} {{association}} between firms' Section 302 and Section 404 internal control weaknesses and these firms' <b>cash-to-cash</b> flow sensitivities. We also examine whether {{the presence of the}} internal control weaknesses affects the relationship between firms' asset liquidity and stock liquidity. We find that the presence of Section 404 internal control weaknesses is associated with stronger <b>cash-to-cash</b> flow sensitivities and with weaker impact of higher asset liquidity on stock liquidity. Our results suggest that internal control weaknesses increase firms' reliance on internal, as opposed to external, financing. Also, internal control weaknesses increase uncertainty over future uses of cash, thereby reducing the positive impact of higher relative cash balances on stock liquidity. Thus, our study provides additional evidence on the potential costs of internal control weaknesses. cash policies; internal control weaknesses; asset liquidity; stock liquidity; <b>cash-to-cash</b> flow; cash balances...|$|E
40|$|Although Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) {{implementation}} faces {{a host of}} challenges, Wal-Mart perseveres in its {{drive for}} RFID adoption throughout its supply chain. By being such early adopters of RFID, Wal-Mart’s suppliers suffer increased costs which put pressure to bear on their profitability. In {{the face of the}} additional costs of RFID, why has Wal-Mart chosen to mandate the use of RFID tagging in its supply chain and insisted on such a short implementation period? This paper reviews Wal-Mart’s relationship with its supply chain, describes Wal-Mart’s RFID initiative, and proposes a possible unexpressed motivation underlying Wal-Mart’s drive to go to RFID. Early results are indicating incremental improvements at Wal-Mart due to RFID implementation; however, the argument can be made that Wal-Mart’s ultimate goal is an innovative improvement on a Schumpeterian scale – the desire to radically improve an important supply chain metric, the <b>cash-to-cash</b> cycle. This reasoning supports fertile areas for future research in the relationship between RFID and the <b>Cash-to-Cash</b> Cycle...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} puts forth a {{new perspective}} on <b>cash-to-cash</b> cycle, a performance metric that relates to both finance and supply chain management. In criticism of the existing literature, which virtually views the firm as an isolate body, we look at cash to cash cycle optimization through a supply chain lens, in the hope of being able to formulate a more discreet approach. Our study involves a literature review followed by a case study featuring Dell Inc., the American PC manufacturer. The authors discuss the effects of C 2 C optimization by dissecting the metric into its 3 constituents,whereby we are able {{to examine the effects of}} different C 2 C optimization methods separately. We bring up the caveats posed by these individual methods and also uncover the cases where reciprocal improvement opportunities lie. Lastly, we lay out our findings by proposing suggestions to deal with such effects under the defined scenarios. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims at {{outlining}} {{the importance and}} the value proposition of Financial Supply Chain Management to increase shareholder value. According to recent studies {{a huge amount of}} working capital is tied up in the Supply Chain. Process-oriented activities in the Supply Chain such as quali cation, invoice and claim management and nance-oriented activities such as management of working capital, valorization and capital appropriation and demand release working capital bundled in the Supply Chain. This is realized by a reduction in Days-Sales-Outstanding, which consequently shortens the <b>Cash-to-Cash</b> Cycle. Thus leading to higher liquidity and increased shareholder value. Understanding that a huge potential lies in Financial Supply Chain Management can make the difference between competitiveness or failure, especially in times of crisis, as we experience right now with the global nancial crisis.

40|$|Simulation {{games are}} an {{effective}} educational tool that offer life-like scenarios and develop valuable functional business knowledge and decision-making skills. These skills {{have been shown}} to be invaluable in the current job market. This paper describes a novel adaptation of the HEC Montreal Enterprise Resource Planning Simulation Game into an interinstitutional competition. Teams of university students and academics from five Melbourne-based universities, aided by industry mentors, put their business skills to the test for an intensive simulation game using a real world ERP system: SAP. Teams were required to complete the full <b>cash-to-cash</b> cycle, by interacting with suppliers and customers, sending and receiving orders, and delivering a range of muesli bar products. To develop a range of business and „soft‟ skills, participants adopted individual business roles and made life-like decisions in a competitive, time-constrained environment. Participants found the game exceeded expectations by fully demonstrating the interaction of a life-like supply chain...|$|E
40|$|A {{common problem}} for {{manufacturing}} related practitioners {{is to show}} stakeholders how improvement suggestions actually provide benefits to their organisations. Previous research explains that improvement actions need top management support to be successfully implemented. Top management is however driven by financial performance requirements and thus {{there is a need}} for manufacturing developers to present ideas and suggestions that are generating true financial impact and investment value. Related problems are derived to many sources, for instance difficulties to isolate improvement actions to certain cost locations in the financial statement, accounting method in use, cost fluctuations over time and the ability of practitioners to speak the financial language. This paper provides a concept for analysing manufacturing related cash flows aiming to give developers the means to persuade or at least, increase stakeholders risk willingness to invest in manufacturing development. A central concept of this paper is the <b>cash-to-cash</b> (C 2 C) cycle that explains how working capital, i. e. capital necessary for running the business, is tied up in different forms on its journey towards value creation. Additionally, operational improvement examples are provided to explain cause and effect relations between financial performance and manufacturing improvement initiatives...|$|E
40|$|Key words: {{infrastructure}} project, {{cash management}} and control, target cash balance. In {{this study we}} look at infrastructure tender projects. Fi-nancial data for cost estimates are collected from 42 infra-structure tender projects (including 20 MRT construction tender projects, 14 highway construction tender projects, and 8 public building tender projects). The Takagi-Sugeno’s fuzzy theory is first applied to build an s-curve regression model for big projects. After the model is fitted, the <b>cash-to-cash</b> cycle concept is applied to analyze and diagram cash flow estima-tions for the execution stage of contracted projects. The goal is to understand short-term financial demands that occur dur-ing the execution stage, {{which leads to a}} better understanding of cash flow problems. Then, by revising the Miller-Orr cash flow model, a flexible target cash balance model with dual control limits is developed. The analysis of the model appli-cation is simple. All the calculations can be done with a trial balance software package such as Excel. In practice, contrac-tors can use s-curve models to preview the cash distribution and amount demanded before projects are executed. Once construction is under way, data from the actual project cash flow can be used to update and revise the predictions. Prepa-ration for dispatching of funds will be made according to cash predictions from the models. I...|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of ERP (enterprise resource planning) systems {{as a major}} system for organisational change and transformation {{has been one of}} the main reasons they have created such excitement within the educational arena. This pap er examines the use of an ERP simulation game to prepare university graduates to meet the challenge of a global supply chain environment. It describes the novel approach taken to adapt the HEC Montreal ERP simulation game into a one day online inter-institutional competition. The competition involved teams of university students and lecturers from four Melbourne-based universities who, with the help of industry mentors, put their business skills to the test for an intensive simulation game by using a real world ERP system: SAP. The teams ran the full business cycle of a small manufacturing company, while interacting with suppliers and customers by sending and receiving orders, delivering the product and completing the entire <b>cash-to-cash</b> cycle. To develop a range of business and ‘soft’ skills, participants adopted individual business roles and made life-like decisions around the product they were selling: muesli bars. In general, participants felt that although their general knowledge of ERP systems was low, the game fully demonstrated the interaction of the supply chain. Additionally the game exceeded their expectations as they worked alongside an industry mentor in a team environment to achieve a common goal. [...] PACIS 2011 held: Brisbane, 7 - 11 July, 201...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to investigate the impact of <b>Cash-to-Cash</b> cycle time (C 2 C), inventory conversion period (INV), receivable conversion period (AR), and payable deferral period (AP) of listed private hospitals in the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) on their corporate profitability, by using both regular and panel data analysis. The outcome would be compared with the expectations from supply chain management theory. The data are obtained from the financial reports of the listed private hospitals in SET across 13 private hospital populations, from 2002 to 2008. The hypothesis testing is applied to determine the association between the dependent variable (asset turnover, AT) and independent variables (INV, AR, AP, and C 2 C). In addition, the control variables are company size, sales growth, financial debt level, and annual gross domestic product growth. The results from regular regression, unexpectedly show that only the independent variable AP is negatively related to AT under the control variables. The rest of the independent variables statically reveal no relationship with AT at significance level 0. 10. On the other hand, the results from panel data regression show that both AR and AP are negatively related with AT at significance level 0. 10. Comparatively, the results from panel data regression analysis are better because it can provide better significance levels and more similar outcomes with the theory. The results also suggest that the listed firms in SET can increase corporate profitability by decreasing AR and AP. Reference [1] provided similar results by using the regression analysis.

40|$|Purpose – Supply chains {{directly}} {{influence the}} differentiation {{and cost of}} a firm's products and services and its exposure to risk. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to use secondary financial data to explore the relationship between supply chain and firm performance by developing a unified proxy for supply chain performance. Design/methodology/approach – Established econometric techniques were used to validate the proxy using a sample frame comprising the annual reports of 117 publicly traded UK manufacturing firms from the period 1995 to 2004. Findings – Increases in change in the proxy lead to an increase in change in the rate of return on capital employed and a change in the rate of <b>cash‐to‐cash</b> cycle length, both of which are traditional measures of improved supply chain management. Moreover, as the rate of change of the proxy increases, so does enterprise value at a level that is statistically significant, indicating that improving supply chain management practices has a positive impact upon improved firm performance. Research limitations/implications – As annual financial results were used the analysis is at a high level so there is a lack of resolution in identifying discrete causes. The use of annual financial results also means that the research can only take yearly snapshots of firm performance. Practical implications – The paper indicates that the supply chain is an enabler, not an impediment, to superior organisational performance. Originality/value – The originality and value of this paper is that it develops a proxy to explain the relationships between supply chain and an organisation's financial performance taking into account the three imperatives of profitability, liquidity, and productivity. ...|$|E
