5|$|<b>Cabbage</b> is {{prepared}} and consumed in many ways. The simplest options include eating the vegetable raw or steaming it, though many cuisines pickle, stew, sautée or braise <b>cabbage.</b> Pickling {{is one of}} the most popular ways of preserving <b>cabbage,</b> creating dishes such as sauerkraut and kimchi, although kimchi is more often made from Chinese <b>cabbage</b> (B.rapa). Savoy cabbages are usually used in salads, while smooth-leaf types are utilized for both market sales and processing. Bean curd and <b>cabbage</b> is a staple of Chinese cooking, while the British dish bubble and squeak is made primarily with leftover potato and boiled <b>cabbage</b> and eaten with cold meat. In Poland, <b>cabbage</b> {{is one of the}} main food crops, and it features prominently in Polish cuisine. It is frequently eaten, either cooked or as sauerkraut, as a side dish or as an ingredient in such dishes as bigos (<b>cabbage,</b> sauerkraut, meat, and wild mushrooms, among other ingredients) gołąbki (stuffed <b>cabbage)</b> and pierogi (filled dumplings). Other eastern European countries, such as Hungary and Romania, also have traditional dishes that feature <b>cabbage</b> as a main ingredient. In India and Ethiopia, <b>cabbage</b> is often included in spicy salads and braises. In the United States, <b>cabbage</b> is used primarily for the production of coleslaw, followed by market use and sauerkraut production.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} Lundy <b>cabbage,</b> Psylliodes luridipennis has been {{listed in the}} United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan, and an action plan for its {{conservation}}, along with the conservation of other endemic species, has been prepared. This plan revolves mostly around the control of Rhododendron ponticum, an alien species which threatens the Lundy <b>cabbage.</b> The beetle is threatened by fluctuating numbers of Lundy cabbages. Though it is quicker than P. napi to recolonise new growth after bad years for the <b>cabbage,</b> it is slower to recover than the <b>cabbage</b> itself.|$|E

50|$|Korean sea salt, with {{a larger}} grain size and lower sodium content {{compared}} to common kosher salt, {{is used for the}} initial salting of napa <b>cabbages.</b> Being minimally processed, it serves to help developing flavors in fermented foods. Per 100 g water, around 2 g of salt is used. Half of the salt is dissolved in water before putting the <b>cabbages</b> in, and the other half is sprinkled in between the layers of napa <b>cabbages</b> that were washed, trimmed, and halved or quartered lengthwise. The <b>cabbages</b> are salted in the brine for several hours, turned over, then salted for more hours. After that, salted <b>cabbages</b> are washed thoroughly under running water and drained.|$|R

5|$|Basic {{research}} on <b>cabbage</b> phytochemicals is ongoing to discern if certain <b>cabbage</b> compounds may affect health or have anti-disease effects. Such compounds include sulforaphane and other glucosinolates which may stimulate {{the production of}} detoxifying enzymes during metabolism. Studies suggest that cruciferous vegetables, including <b>cabbage,</b> may have protective effects against colon cancer. <b>Cabbage</b> {{is a source of}} indole-3-carbinol, a chemical under basic research for its possible properties.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cabbage</b> {{has been}} linked to {{outbreaks}} of some food-borne illnesses, including Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum. The latter toxin has been traced to pre-made, packaged coleslaw mixes, while the spores were found on whole cabbages that were otherwise acceptable in appearance. Shigella species are able to survive in shredded <b>cabbage.</b> Two outbreaks of E.coli in the United States have been linked to <b>cabbage</b> consumption. Biological risk assessments have concluded that there is the potential for further outbreaks linked to uncooked <b>cabbage,</b> due to contamination at many stages of the growing, harvesting and packaging processes. Contaminants from water, humans, animals and soil have the potential to be transferred to <b>cabbage,</b> and from there to the end consumer.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cabbage</b> {{has been}} {{selectively}} bred for head weight and morphological characteristics, frost hardiness, fast growth and storage ability. The {{appearance of the}} <b>cabbage</b> head has been given importance in selective breeding, with varieties being chosen for shape, color, firmness and other physical characteristics. Breeding objectives are now focused on increasing resistance to various insects and diseases and improving the nutritional content of <b>cabbage.</b> Scientific research into the genetic modification of B.oleracea crops, including <b>cabbage,</b> has included European Union and United States explorations of greater insect and herbicide resistance. Genetically modified B.oleracea crops are not currently used in commercial agriculture.|$|E

5|$|<b>Cabbage</b> {{was most}} likely domesticated somewhere in Europe before 1000 BC, {{although}} savoys were not developed until the 16th century. By the Middle Ages, <b>cabbage</b> had become a prominent part of European cuisine. <b>Cabbage</b> heads are generally picked {{during the first year}} of the plant's life cycle, but plants intended for seed are allowed to grow a second year, and must be kept separated from other cole crops to prevent cross-pollination. <b>Cabbage</b> is prone to several nutrient deficiencies, as well as to multiple pests, and bacterial and fungal diseases.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>cabbage</b> varieties—including {{some still}} {{commonly}} grown—were introduced in Germany, France, and the Low Countries. During the 16th century, German gardeners developed the savoy <b>cabbage.</b> During the 17th and 18th centuries, <b>cabbage</b> was a food staple in such countries as Germany, England, Ireland and Russia, and pickled <b>cabbage</b> was frequently eaten. Sauerkraut {{was used by}} Dutch, Scandinavian and German sailors to prevent scurvy during long ship voyages.|$|E
5|$|Psylliodes luridipennis, {{commonly}} known as the Lundy <b>cabbage</b> flea beetle or the bronze Lundy <b>cabbage</b> flea beetle, is a species of flea beetle endemic to the island of Lundy, where it lives and feeds upon the endemic Lundy <b>cabbage</b> (Coincya wrightii). Along with the true weevil Ceutorhynchus contractus var. pallipes and an undescribed race of flea beetle Psylliodes napi, it is known only from the Lundy <b>cabbage.</b> The species was first recorded by Thomas Vernon Wollaston in the 1840s, and was named by the Austrian entomologist Franz Kutschera in 1864.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to map and count the individual <b>cabbages</b> at the early growth stage in Sg. Palas, Cameron Highland grown under a mix cropping system and estimate its production. With ground verification, an IKONOS 4 m multispectral imagery acquired on 25 February 2001 was digitally processed at an orthorectified level. A Digital Terrain Model (DTM) was developed and a scanned topographical map was overlaid with IKONOS data to precisely locate the attribute data and map the individual young growing <b>cabbages.</b> Using a supervised and unsupervised classification, less than and above 1. 5 month-old <b>cabbages</b> were mapped and quantified. The algorithm and processing technique developed in this study can easily estimate a production of 25, 000 cabbages/ha in Sg Palas area. Integrating the data with a Geographic Information System (GIS) may help Cameron Highland farmers to better market their <b>cabbages</b> in the future. The potential use of airborne hyperspectral imaging data such as UPM-TropAIR’s AISA TropAIRMAPTM to map and predict the supply of <b>cabbages</b> should be the next step in precision farming revolution using remote sensing...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{establish}} the storage room of agricultural products cooled by snow. The changes of physical properties and nutrition ingredient of stored vegetables in each storage room were compared after Chinese <b>cabbages,</b> <b>cabbages,</b> Japanese radishes, carrots, tomatoes, and spinets were stored in the storage room of cooled by snow or the electric refrigerator. Significant differences in moisture and temperature between the two storage systems were not observed. The hardness of <b>cabbages</b> and Japanese radish among examined vegetables tended to be held in the storage room cooled by snow. The decrease of the moisture level of Japanese <b>cabbages,</b> <b>cabbages</b> and carrot was slightly inhibited in the storage room of cooled by snow. The vitamin C level of Japanese radishes and tomatoes tended to be held in the storage room cooled by snow compared to the electric refrigerator. The sugar levels of Japanese <b>cabbages,</b> <b>cabbages,</b> and Japanese radishes was same in the two storage systems. Lycopene and β- carotene levels were higher in tomatoes stored in the storage room of cooled by snow than in those stored in electric refrigerator, however, β- carotene level of carrots stored in the storage room cooled by snow was lower than that stored in the electric refrigerator. Thus, the uncommon problem was not observed in storage of vegetables using the storage room cooled by snow, although the changes of physical properties and nutrition ingredient in vegetables stored in each storage systems were slightly different. Therefore, the storage room of agricultural products cooled by snow may be available in an area of high snowfall...|$|R
5|$|The ancient Greeks {{had some}} {{varieties}} of <b>cabbage,</b> as mentioned by Theophrastus, although {{whether they were}} {{more closely related to}} today's <b>cabbage</b> or to one of the other Brassica crops is unknown. The headed <b>cabbage</b> variety was known to the Greeks as krambe and to the Romans as brassica or olus; the open, leafy variety (kale) was known in Greek as raphanos and in Latin as caulis.|$|E
5|$|Two {{invertebrate}} taxa are {{endemic to}} Lundy, with both feeding on the endemic Lundy <b>cabbage</b> (Coincya wrightii). These are the Lundy <b>cabbage</b> flea beetle (Psylliodes luridipennis), {{a species of}} leaf beetle (family Chrysomelidae) and the Lundy <b>cabbage</b> weevil (Ceutorhynchus contractus var. pallipes), a variety of true weevil (family Curculionidae). In addition, the Lundy <b>cabbage</b> is the main host of a flightless form of Psylliodes napi (another species of flea beetle) and {{a wide variety of}} other invertebrate species which are not endemic to the island. Another resident invertebrate of note is Atypus affinis, the only British species of purseweb spider.|$|E

5|$|<b>Cabbage</b> (Brassica oleracea or B.oleracea var. capitata, var. tuba, var. sabauda or var. acephala) is {{a member}} of the genus Brassica and the mustard family, Brassicaceae. Several other cruciferous {{vegetables}} (sometimes known as cole crops) are considered cultivars of B.oleracea, including broccoli, collard greens, brussels sprouts, kohlrabi and sprouting broccoli. All of these developed from the wild <b>cabbage</b> B.oleracea var. oleracea, also called colewort or field <b>cabbage.</b> This original species evolved over thousands of years into those seen today, as selection resulted in cultivars having different characteristics, such as large heads for <b>cabbage,</b> large leaves for kale and thick stems with flower buds for broccoli.|$|E

5|$|<b>Cabbage</b> was {{probably}} domesticated later in history than Near Eastern {{crops such as}} lentils and summer wheat. Because of {{the wide range of}} crops developed from the wild B.oleracea, multiple broadly contemporaneous domestications of <b>cabbage</b> may have occurred throughout Europe.

5|$|Chrysippus of Cnidos wrote a {{treatise}} on <b>cabbage,</b> which Pliny knew, {{but it has}} not survived.

5|$|In {{addition}} to its usual purpose as an edible vegetable, <b>cabbage</b> has been used historically as a medicinal herb {{for a variety of}} purported health benefits. For example, the Ancient Greeks recommended consuming the vegetable as a laxative, and used <b>cabbage</b> juice as an antidote for mushroom poisoning, for eye salves, and for liniments used to help bruises heal. In De Agri Cultura (On Agriculture), Cato the Elder suggested that women could prevent diseases by bathing in urine obtained from those who had frequently eaten <b>cabbage.</b> The ancient Roman nobleman Pliny the Elder described both culinary and medicinal properties of the vegetable, recommending it for drunkenness—both preventatively to counter the effects of alcohol and to cure hangovers. Similarly, the Ancient Egyptians ate cooked <b>cabbage</b> at the beginning of meals to reduce the intoxicating effects of wine. This traditional usage persisted in European literature until the mid-20th century.|$|E
