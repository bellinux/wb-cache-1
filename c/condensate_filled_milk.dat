Richardson, 350 F.Supp. 221 (S.D. Ill. 1972). Further, the United States Department of Agriculture has broadly refused to consider <b>filled</b> <b>milk</b> products to be [...] "in imitation or semblance of milk" [...] and therefore has declined {{to see them as}} within the statute.

5000|$|<b>Filled</b> <b>milk</b> is any milk, cream, or {{skim milk}} {{that has been}} reconstituted with fats, usually {{vegetable}} oils, from sources other than dairy cows. [...] Pure evaporated <b>filled</b> <b>milk</b> is generally considered unsuitable for drinking because of its particular flavor, but is equivalent to unadulterated evaporated milk for baking and cooking purposes. Other <b>filled</b> <b>milk</b> products with substituted fat are used to make ice cream, sour cream, whipping cream, and half-and-half substitutes among other dairy products. Coconut oil <b>filled</b> <b>milk</b> became a popular cost-saving product sold throughout the United States in the early 20th century. Coconut oil could be cheaply imported, primarily from the Philippines (at the time under American rule), and this product was able to undercut the market for evaporated and condensed milk. At the time, liquid milk was not widely available or very popular because of the rarity of refrigeration and the problems of transportation and storage.|$|R

Many states also passed bans or restrictions on the sale and production of <b>filled</b> <b>milk</b> products. The issue of <b>filled</b> <b>milk</b> came to the forefront in United States v.

40|$|Packaging {{plays an}} {{important}} role in protecting and preserving the quality of food and is therefore significant in any food manufacturing and distribution process. The shelf life of any food is limited due to the occurrence of many deteriorative processes and reactions within the food material. These include physical and chemical reactions and interactions between food and the ambient environment across the packaging material. Milk powder like any other food, is prone to such reactions and interactions with package resulting in degradation of its edible quality due to changes in smell, colour and texture, which ultimately renders it nutritionally and economically unacceptable. During distribution and storage the packaging system needs to stabilize the powder by ensuring optimum storage conditions are maintained. To ensure maximum shelf life it is essential to apply packaging systems that are optimally designed, to meet the requirements with respect to manufacturing as well as product protection in the distribution environment. In this thesis, the interactions between ambient environmental conditions, packaging material properties and the shelf life of a particular <b>filled</b> <b>milk</b> powder were investigated. Consequently, the requirements for a packaging system that can provide a two-year shelf life for the powder were determined. The <b>filled</b> <b>milk</b> powder is manufactured and packaged in bulk in Europe, imported into Africa via sea freight containers to be repacked into small portion packs and distributed in multiple African countries. Because of Africa's tropical conditions the packaged product is exposed to rather high levels of relative humidity and temperature during transportation and storage which influences the stability of the powder. The storage stability of the <b>filled</b> <b>milk</b> powder along with the barrier characteristics of the packaging was assessed in order to evaluate the theoretical shelf life of the powder in its current packaging system...|$|R
