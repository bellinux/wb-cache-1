30|$|For Poplar, {{the curve}} was {{composed}} of three parts. At the beginning, the stress increased proportionally {{with the increase of}} compression strain (ratio); over the proportional limit, the radial wall of wood cell was bent under the radial compression, leading to the easy movement of the tangential wall from one to the other. As a result of this, the stress increased slowly. When the tangential wall <b>contacted</b> <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> the stress increased again. As mentioned before, the cell walls has already <b>contacted</b> <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> before reaching the maximum compression ratio (60 %) in Poplar, while the lumen void still existed even at the maximum compression ratio (40 %) in Chinese fir, that’s why the stress increased again for Poplar and only first two parts of the curve shown in Chinese fir (Fig.  3).|$|R

As such, the surrounding water pressure affects the energy of the calls, but it does not appear to affect the frequency levels.|$|E

5|$|The tufted tit-tyrant is a generalist feeder that eats insects. It is {{also known}} to eat seeds in rare circumstances. It is an active forager that hunts in pairs or, after the {{breeding}} season, small family groups. It has also been known to feed with mixed-species foraging flocks, although this behavior is abnormal. When this does occur, it is most frequently seen foraging with the thorn-tailed rayadito; flocks of thirty tufted tit-tyrants in these mixed-species foraging groups have been reported. Birds in pairs tend to feed leapfrog style and maintain constant visual <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> This species feeds at all strata of its habitat from the understory to the canopy.|$|E

In the Noronha skink, the supranasal scales (located above the nose) are in contact, as are the prefrontal scales (behind the nose) in most individuals.

Unlike in T.maculata, the parietal scales (behind the frontoparietals) are in <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> There are four supraocular scales (above the eyes) in almost all specimens and five supraciliary scales (immediately above the eyes, below the supraoculars).

However, the idea of forming an alliance with the Khmer Rouge initially caused a certain degree of uneasiness within the leadership circles of the FUNCINPEC and the KPNLF, because both groups were leery about joining with a communist organization well known for its brutality.
