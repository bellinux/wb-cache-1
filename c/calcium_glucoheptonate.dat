40|$|The {{effects of}} {{estradiol}} dipropionate (EDP) or <b>calcium</b> <b>glucoheptonate</b> (Ca) on the morphology and stereology of the PRL cells in 14 -month-old Wistar female rats were studied. The animals were treated daily with EDP in the dose of 0. 625 mg/kg b. w. or <b>calcium</b> <b>glucoheptonate</b> (Ca; 11. 4 mg/kg b. w.) for two weeks. The controls were injected with vehicle alone {{by the same}} schedule. Mammotrophs (PRL cells) were immunocytochemically localized by the PAP method. Blood PRL concentration was determined by Delfia procedure. In animals treated with EDP the volume of both, PRL cells and their nuclei, {{as well as the}} volume densities were significantly (p 0. 05) decreased compared to control rats. Serum concentration of PRL was significantly increased (p 0. 05) changed by 2 % compared to controls. Based on these results, it can be concluded that EDP expresses a strong stimulatory effect on the morphology and function of pituitary PRL cells.

40|$|Summary: The {{subject of}} these studies was the thyroid gland tissue of middle-aged (14 -month-old) female rats chronically treated with <b>calcium</b> <b>glucoheptonate.</b> The {{peripheral}} and central zone of the thyroids were stereologically analysed and the following morphometric parameters determined: the height and volumetric density of follicular epithelium, colloid, interstitium and follicles and index of activation rate. The height of follicular epithelium, its volume density and index of activation rate were significantly reduced (by 8 %, p < 0. 05, 18 %, p< 0. 025 and 34 %, p < 0. 01, respectively) {{as compared to the}} controls. However, the volumetric density of colloid and interstitium were increased (by 10 % and 14 % respectively). These morphometric results indicate that Ca treatment expressed an inhibitory effect on thyroid follicular cells structure in middle-aged female rats...|$|E
40|$|Solutions of glucoheptonate {{and sodium}} pertechnetate (Tc- 99 m) were {{subjected}} to electrolysis at various ampere-time products until a charge was found that consistently promoted tagging of greater than 90 % efti ciency. It was found that 9 coulombs (100 mA, 90 sec) consistently yielded a final product that contained less than 10 % total radiochemical impurities (unbound pertechnetate and reduced, hydrolyzed technetium). Radiochemi cal purity of the final product was established using a two-solvent thin-layer chromatographic system with methyl-ethyl ketone and normal saline as the solvents. The tagging efficiency and stability of the tagged complex were determined with similar chromatographic analysis. It was shown that use of a 15 % solution of <b>calcium</b> <b>glucoheptonate</b> resulted in a more stable product than that prepared from commercially available stannous gluco heptonate. The rapid, accurate chromatographic method for determination of radiochemical purity of the product is described. The final product is con sidered equal or superior to commercial Tc- 99 m (Sn) glucoheptonate an...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{multiple}} doses of estradiol dipropionate (EDP) or <b>calcium</b> <b>glucoheptonate</b> (Ca) {{on the growth}} and function of pituitary somatotropes (GH cells) were studied. Female middle-aged rats were receiving i. p. EDP (0. 625 mg i. p. /kg b. w), or Ca (11. 4 mg/kg b. w) every day for two weeks. Blood samples were collected for hormone analyses and pituitaries dissected for histological and morphometric evaluation 24 h after the last injection. GH-producing cells were examined using the peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) immuno-histochemical procedure. Both EDP- and Ca-treatment significantly decreased all morphometric parameters of GH cells (p< 0. 05) {{in comparison with the}} corresponding controls. Serum concentration of growth hormone (GH) in EDP- or Ca-treated groups was lower by 65 % and 13 % (p< 0. 05) respectively comparing to the controls. The difference between all morphometric parameters of EDP- and Ca-treated rats was statistically significant (p< 0. 05) in relation to the controls. These findings suggest that multiple EDP, or Ca application affects (directly or indirectly) the control of growth and secretory activity of GH cells in middle-aged female rats...|$|E
