Sauguet was introduced to Lunel by Milhaud {{at the time of the}} premiere of Les Malheurs d'Orphée in Paris and met him again in 1927 during the preparations for Sauguet's ballet La <b>Chatte</b> for the Ballets Russes.|$|E

25|$|Alongside these events, Ogami {{experiences}} Parisian {{city life}} and culture while training {{the group to}} function with the same ability as the Imperial Assault Group alongside their roles as cabaret performers at Les <b>Chatte</b> Noir. During his interactions with each member, he has the option of pursuing a romance with them. The flow of events is broken slightly when the Imperial Assault Group arrives in Paris during summer holidays, and demonstrates their comradeship and unity to the Paris group during a dance competition. Following Salu's defeat, Ogami determines that the group is able to fend for itself and sets off on his travels once again. The final scenes alter depending on whether Ogami pursued a romance {{with a member of}} the group.|$|E

50|$|When the Imperial Assault Force {{went into}} service and had {{proven to be}} an {{effective}} means of defending Tokyo, other countries soon followed. It began with the creation of the Paris Assault Force, with its base of operations located at a famous Parisian night club known as the Theatre <b>Chattes</b> Noires (Teatoru Shanowā). The New York Fighting Troupe was established at the Little Lip Theater (Ritorurippu Shiatā) on Broadway shortly afterwards.|$|R
2500|$|Sakura Wars 3: Is Paris Burning? {{is set in}} Paris {{during a}} fictionalized version of the 1920s, with players taking the role of Ichiro Ogami and the all-female Paris Assault Force. Dubbed a [...] "dramatic adventure" [...] game and taking place across {{multiple}} episodes, the gameplay segments incorporate tactical role-playing, dating sim and visual novel elements. Gameplay is divided between adventure segments where Ogami explores Montmartre—the area of Paris surrounding Les <b>Chatte</b> Noir—, and combat sequences governed by a turn-based battle system across a three-dimensional (3D) area allowing full range of movement.|$|E
2500|$|Offenbach devised {{three major}} dance {{sequences}} {{in deference to}} the Alhambra's reputation as a theatre of ballet: for sailors in Act 1, a 'Grand Barbaric Ballet' in Act 2 and a ballet for peasants and archers in the fourth act. The 1890s French critic in Les Annales was particularly impressed by several numbers of the score, noting particularly the quartet [...] "Tout bon citoyen d'Angleterre", the cat's song, the duetto [...] "Mais qu'est ce donc qu'une <b>chatte</b> ?" [...] and the Act 1 quartet of the inventory. Yon cites the ballad [...] "Wind that blows across the sea", Hirvoia's brindisi, the police sergeant's comic song and the first act finale with its 'romance du miaou' and waltz song, as evidence of Offenbach keeping to his high musical standards.|$|E
2500|$|Sakura Wars 3 {{opens with}} Ogami {{arriving}} in Paris to train a new fighting unit {{established by the}} Parisian government to combat supernatural threats—dubbed the [...] "Paris Assault Group", it maintains its cover as a cabaret act at the nightclub Les <b>Chatte</b> Noir. The initial members are clumsy nun Erica Fontaine, and cold French noble Glycine Bleumer. In his efforts {{to build up the}} group, Ogami helps recruit three more members—Coquelicot, a Vietnamese traveling circus performer; French-Japanese widow Hanabi Kitaoji; and Romanian master thief Lobelia Carlini. As the group builds, Paris is attacked are assaulted by a group of black magicians dubbed the Paris Phantoms, many of which torment members of the group in attempts to break them. The Paris Phantoms are revealed to be controlled by the clown Salu; the last of a near-extinct ethnic group who communed with Paris' dead, Salu intends to use the Great Oak Tree, a god-like being which guards Paris, to resurrect his people using Paris' population as sacrifices. Using their united spiritual power, the Paris Assault Group are able to defeat Salu and restore Paris and the Great Oak Tree.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{adventure}} segments, Ogami navigates Mondmartre and the Le <b>Chatte</b> Noir from his apartment base. During these sequences, when talking {{with both the}} main heroines of the Paris Assault Force and supporting characters, conversations rely on the LIPS (Live & Interactive Picture System) system. When faced with critical choices {{in the course of}} a conversation, conversation options are displayed with a time limit for the player to select a response. Depending on the type of response, the character may respond positively or negatively, impacting their relationship with Ogami and future interactions. Other actions within LIPS include holding the cursor over parts of a character's portrait to trigger internal monologues and varying responses from the characters. The version used in Sakura Wars 3 is dubbed [...] "Analog LIPS"; certain choices allow for use of the analog stick to adjust to intensity of a single answer, which can in turn elicit further variation from characters. An additional [...] "dinner mode" [...] has Ogami taking dinner with the other protagonists, with whom Ogami initiates a conversation with and how that conversation develops affecting later interactions. A version of this mode, dubbed [...] "Elegant Day in Paris", is dedicated solely to navigation and LIPS-based interactions.|$|E
2500|$|On 19 July 1940 the Special Operations Executive (SOE) {{was founded}} in Britain with orders from Churchill to [...] "set Europe ablaze". The F Section of the SOE was headed by Maurice Buckmaster and {{provided}} invaluable support for the resistance. From May 1941, Freney founded Combat, {{one of the first}} Resistance groups. Frenay recruited for Combat by asking people such questions like if they believed that Britain would not be defeated and if they thought a German victory was worth stopping, and based on the answers he received would ask those whom he thought were inclined to resistance: [...] "Men are already gathering in the shadows. Will you join them?". Frenay, who was to emerge as one of the leading resistance chefs, later wrote: [...] "I myself never attacked a den of collaborators or derailed trains. I never killed a German or a Gestapo agent with my own hand". For security reasons, Combat was divided into a series of cells that were unaware of each other. Another early resistance groups founded in the summer of 1940 was the ill-fated Interallié group led by a Polish émigré Roman Czerniawski and a Frenchwoman Mathilde Carré codenamed La <b>Chatte</b> (the cat) that passed on intelligence from contacts in the Deuxième Bureau to Britain via couriers from Marseilles.|$|E

60|$|Gammer Gurton is {{patching}} {{the leather}} breeches of her man Hodge, when Gib, the cat, {{gets into the}} milk pan. While Gammer chases the cat the family needle is lost, a veritable calamity in those days. The whole household is turned upside down, and the neighbors are dragged into the affair. Various comical situations are brought about by Diccon, a thieving vagabond, who tells Gammer that her neighbor, Dame <b>Chatte,</b> has taken her needle, and who then hurries to tell Dame <b>Chatte</b> that she is accused by Gammer of stealing a favorite rooster. Naturally there is a terrible row when the two irate old women meet and misunderstand each other. Diccon also drags Doctor Rat, the curate, into the quarrel by telling him that, if he will but creep into Dame Chatte's cottage by a hidden way, he will find her using the stolen needle. Then Diccon secretly warns Dame <b>Chatte</b> that Gammer Gurton's man Hodge is coming to steal her chickens; and the old woman hides in the dark passage and cudgels the curate soundly with the door bar. All the parties are finally brought before the justice, when Hodge suddenly and painfully finds the lost needle--which is all the while stuck in his leather breeches--and the scene ends uproariously for both audience and actors.|$|E

And really, by my word, now I examine him, {{that is the}} same little man who was so savage with you at the concert: the very same, and in his soul he is frantic at this moment because he sees me laughing.
