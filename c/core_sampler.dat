The penetration forces, if recorded, give information about the strength of different depths in the material, {{which may be the}} only information required, with samples as an incidental benefit. This technique is common in both civil engineering site investigations (where the techniques tend towards into pile driving) and geological studies of recent aquatic deposits. The low strength of the materials penetrated means that cores have to be relatively small.|$|E
50|$|Direct push {{drilling}} rigs use hydraulic cylinders and a hydraulic hammer in advancing a hollow <b>core</b> <b>sampler</b> to gather soil and groundwater samples. The speed {{and depth of}} penetration is largely dependent on the soil type, {{the size of the}} sampler, and the weight and power of the rig. Direct push techniques are generally limited to shallow soil sample recovery in unconsolidated soil materials. The advantage of direct push technology is that in the right soil type it can produce a large number of high quality samples quickly and cheaply, generally from 50 to 75 meters per day. Rather than hammering, direct push can also be combined with sonic (vibratory) methods to increase drill efficiency.|$|E

The objective of this work was to evaluate the performance of five different types of sampling equipment for soil bulk density determination, in two different soils a Kandiudalfic Eutrudox and a Typic Hapludox, both of Piracicaba, SP, Brazil. Equipment used for soil undisturbed sampling were: (i) Uhland soil sampler; (ii) Kopecky's Ring; (iii) soil <b>core</b> <b>sampler,</b> model "Soil Moisture"; (iv) soil <b>core</b> <b>sampler</b> Bravifer AI- 50 and (v) soil <b>core</b> <b>sampler</b> Bravifer AI- 100. The sampling was made in 4 grids of 1 m², each with 25 sampling points, with five replications, resulting 100 samples for each soil. It was concluded that the sampling techniques can influence soil bulk density distributions, mainly {{in the case of}} clayey soils (Kandiudalfic Eutrudox). The Kopecky's Ring presented larger soil density values, overestimating this property for the two soils studied.

40|$|The Accu <b>Core</b> <b>sampler</b> system {{consists}} of alternating cylindrical clear acrylic sections and one-inch cylindrical stainless steel sections arranged in clear shrink wrap. The set of alternating acrylic {{and stainless steel}} sections in the shrink wrap are designed to fit in a Geoprobe dual-tube penetrometer for collection of continuous soil cores. The clear acrylic sections can have 1 / 2 -inch access holes for easy soil headspace screening without violating {{the integrity of the}} adjacent stainless steel sections. The Accu <b>Core</b> <b>sampler</b> system can be used to store a soil sample collected in the stainless steel section by capping the ends of the section so it becomes a sample storage container. The sampler system {{can also be used to}} collect a subsurface soil sample in one of the sections that can be directly extruded from the section into a container for storage during shipment to the laboratory. In addition, the soil in a sampler section can be quickly sub-sampled using a coring tool and extruded into a storage container so the integrity of the soil is not disrupted and the potential for VOC loss during sub-sampling is greatly reduced. A field validation study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the Accu <b>Core</b> <b>sampler</b> to store VOC soil samples during transportation to the laboratory for analysis and to compare the performance of the Accu Core with current sampling and storage techniques, all of which require sub-sampling when the soil sample is brought to the surface. During some of the validation testing, the acrylic sections having access holes for headspace screening were included in the Accu <b>Core</b> <b>sampler</b> configuration and soil in these sections was screened to show the usefulness of the sample screening capability provided by the Accu Core system.

40|$|The {{condition}} of stream substrate, both in {{rural and urban}} areas, is extremely important {{to the survival of}} salmonids. As fine sediment levels in stream substrate increase, water flow and dissolved oxygen levels decrease thus threatening the survival of salmonids and other aquatic life such as benthic macroinvertebrates. There are many methods for analyzing stream or river habitat conditions that have been developed by federal, state, and private agencies, especially streambed conditions such as cobble embeddedness. Currently there are many methods employed that claim to qualitatively or quantitatively determine cobble embeddedness. This study examined the most prevalent methods employed by government and non-government agencies to analyze fine sediment levels in streambed riffles (i. e., Wolman pebble count, Burns-Skille-King hoop method, Platts/Bain visual estimation, and McNeil <b>core</b> <b>sampler).</b> In addition this study modified and tested a new quantitative method to relate to embeddedness (i. e., a dynamic sediment penetrometer). The Burns-Skille-King (BSK) hoop method, which measures cobble embeddedness directly, was not strongly correlated (r 0. 40). The McNeil <b>core</b> <b>sampler</b> had the highest correlation (r) values with all of the methods. Through the statistical comparison of these methods using Spearman correlations, it was concluded that the best methods to use for gauging the level of cobble embeddedness or fine sediment percentages are the Platts/Bain visual and McNeil <b>core</b> <b>sampler</b> methods.

Compressive strength of each sample was recalculated to cubés compressive strength and was statistically evaluated...|$|R
