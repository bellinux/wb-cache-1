40|$|What is Data Cabling? A {{structured}} cabling {{system is a}} type of network construction that is open and is used by different systems like data, access management, telephony, building automation, along with many other similar capabilities. It is an extremely flexible and economical set up. Usually, a cabling system such as this can be broken into six components: work space, horizontal cabling, backbone cabling, gear space, telecommunication closet (room) and entrance ways. Common Network Set up Work space components are extended over into horizontal cabling networks via the telecommunications connector, reaching into the equipment in the targeted workspace. The components utilized in the work place usually include <b>channel</b> <b>equipment</b> (computers, information terminals, telephones, etc.), patch cables (modular cords, PC adapter wires, fiber patch cables, etc.) and communication sockets or outlets. Horizontal cabling setups are designed to extend to the telecommunications data outlet directly to the desired work area. The elements of horizontal cabling contain cable terminations, telecommunication outlets, cross-connections, cable from the patch panel into the work place, and cross-connects into different telecommunication rooms. Generally speaking, backbone cabling networks contain components such as spine wires (typically optical fiber cables), mechanical terminations, intermediate and main cross-connects, and patch cables that can be utilized for backbone-to-backbone cross-connections. Typically, equipment rooms within a building houses (stores) equipment in a type of network room. This usually includes main corr-connect, horizontal connects, or intermediate cross connects. A telecommunication room house any terminations of backbone and horizontal cables to joining hardware such as patch cords or jumpers. Entrance facilities typically have a telecommunications service entrance to the backbone and construction pathways different buildings. These areas contain the wires, network demarcation points, connecting safety devices, hardware and other equipment that connect to personal network cabling and your access provider. Why a Business Needs a Cabling Structure Without the right network installation and data infrastructure, a company {{would not be able to}} operate or compete in the marketplace. Today, most businesses operate using a data network system to help process transactions, store and handle sensitive information, conduct daily business operations, manage accounting and money, employee tracking and payroll, along with business email and hosting services...|$|E

40|$|Advanced {{communication}} and broadcasting systems use heavily diversity techniques to improve service availability. To analyze {{the performance of}} systems using techniques such as time diversity or time interleaving, antenna diversity and angle diversity, a detailed knowledge of the channel characteristics is essential. Especially the statistical analysis and {{the evaluation of the}} slow fading effect become more important. The <b>Channel</b> Measurement <b>Equipment</b> presented in this paper is a tool for the analysis of waveform topologies and diversity techniques used in general hybrid satellite and terrestrial systems. The equipment was developed in the frame of the ARTES Programme of the European Space Agency. It helps to verify the performance of mobile satellite systems during the system deployment phase and to perform an early validation of the user terminals using multi-antenna configurations. As such, the <b>Channel</b> Measurement <b>Equipment</b> will leverage the position of European ind ustry to design new mobile satellite systems. This paper describes the main characteristics of the <b>Channel</b> Measurement <b>Equipment</b> and the associated methodology for carrying out field experiments.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{procedure}} for enhancing the data quality of shallow seismic data {{based on two}} different steps: 1) an acquisition step that requires the recording of closely spaced common source records with standard source and receiver equipment and 2) a processing step where weighted and/or un-weighted source and/or receiver arrays can be simulated {{on the basis of}} required needs for source related noise attenuation and depth penetration. The data acquisition can be carried out employing single source - single geophone recordings, with a standard 24 or 48 <b>channels</b> <b>equipment.</b> Simple energy sources such as weight drops or sledgehammer are considered. The design and application of the spatial filters in the processing phase is very flexible and can be tailored to the specific needs: in fact, the simulated source and/or receiver arrays can be time and/or space variant and, if needed, can be weighted to provide the desired responses. Optimal weights can be determined by means of Chebyshev polynomials. Real data examples show the increase in the data quality in terms of better coherent noise attenuation and of enhanced depth penetration...|$|R
