Bolt-hole clearance, which arises due to limitations in manufacturing capabilities, is modelled extensively. Clearance levels {{both inside and outside}} typical aerospace fitting tolerances are studied and the finite element model is validated with experimental data. Plots of radial stress in each ply of the countersunk laminate show the load transfer to be severely localised, with only a few plies bearing the majority of the load. The inclusion of clearance in the model was shown to result in far higher radial stresses compared to those in the neat-fit joint model. An associated loss in joint stiffness of more than 10 % was recorded for the highest clearance considered (240 mu m). Finally compressive through-thickness stresses are shown to be present at the damageable region of the <b>countersunk</b> <b>hole,</b> and increase with bolt-hole clearance.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace Engineering. The adhesively bonded layered {{aluminum}} {{is used in}} aircraft {{structures to}} avoid knife edge situations when flush head fasteners are used with minimum gage skins. Due to the <b>countersunk</b> <b>hole</b> and adhesive bonding, stress flow becomes more complicated. Extensive knowledge of the different parameters that affect {{the behavior of the}} bonded joints with countersunk holes is essential for dependable and effective design.

The influence of the various parameters on stress concentration was investigated for a counter sunk angle of 100 º. Different parameters such as ratio of young‟s modulus of adhesive to aluminum, position of adhesive layer, countersunk sunk depths, ratio of thickness to radius and ratio of width to radius have been addressed in this study. The stress flow varies significantly when the plates are filled with fasteners of different pre-tension loads.

40|$|The two {{historical}} fuselage failures, Comet in 1954 and Aloha in 1988, {{illustrate that}} similar accidents must be avoided {{which requires a}} profound understanding of the fatigue mechanisms involved, including analytical models to predict the fatigue behavior of riveted joints of a fuselage structure. The scope of the research project covers a variety of joint types and joining techniques for both monolithic and laminated sheet materials. The fuselage structure is a rather complicated system of parts consisting of skin sheets, tear straps, stringers, frames and doublers. These parts are interconnected by mechanically fastened and bonded joints, {{or a combination of}} both. The complex fuselage structure in the present research is reduced to specimen level size for laboratory testing and theoretical analysis. The major topics of the thesis are: Calculations of the combined tension and bending stress distribution in joints, which implies an extension of the so-called secondary bending model (Chapter 3). Find a direct and simple relation between the formed rivet head and squeeze force. (Chapter 4). Development of stress intensity factors for fatigue cracks in joints loaded under combined tension and application to fatigue crack growth results (Chapter 5). Fractographic observations with the scanning electron microscope of crack front shapes occurring in riveted joints under combined tension and bending (Chapter 5). Analysis of the residual strength of joints with fatigue cracks (Chapter 6). Neutral line model For mechanically fastened lap splice and butt joints in a fuselage structure, a dominant load is introduced by the Ground Air Ground (GAG) pressurization cycle. The hoop load is transferred from one skin panel to the next via the fasteners in the joint. The hoop load is offset by eccentricities in the load path, which causes secondary bending. The bending stress is a non-linear function of the applied tension load. The stress system in the joint then encompasses the membrane stress, the secondary bending stress and the bearing stress associated with the fastener loads on the holes. The secondary bending is highly depending on the magnitude of the eccentricity and the flexural rigidity of the joint between the fastener rows. The theory used to derive the bending stresses is based on the advanced beam theory. A further development of the neutral line model incorporates the internal moment, which is a useful representation of the load transfer occurring in multiple row joints. The calculation of the load transfer can be made for complicated lap splice and butt joints. With the developments of the present research, the neutral line model is still a very powerful tool to use {{in the early stages of}} joint design. It gives a good picture of the stresses in a joint. Riveting Solid rivets and more advanced fasteners are still widely used in aircraft fuselage design efforts. The fasteners are characterized by various parameters associated with the fastener material and geometry, sheet material and installation process. The present investigation focuses on solid rivets installed in aluminum and Glare. The expansion of a solid rivet in a rivet hole is important with respect to the fatigue properties of joints. The expanding rivet inside a fastener hole will create a compressive residual stress around the hole and this will delay fatigue crack nucleation. It is important to know the correct squeeze force used to form the driven head of a rivet. Measurements of the formed rivet head (diameter or protruding height) can be used to obtain information about the applied squeezing force. The riveting process is a non linear deformation process characterized by large plastic strains. Simple equations based on constant volume of the rivet and the Holloman model for uniform plastic deformation, were adopted to evaluate the riveting process. Useful results were obtained about the correlation between the rivet head deformation and the applied squeezing force. Stress intensity factors As a result of combined tension and secondary bending in a lap joint, fatigue cracks at the edge of a hole start at one side of the sheet only. Initially these cracks at the edge of a hole are growing as a part through the thickness corner crack, which later become a through the thickness crack, a so called through crack. But also for a through crack, the shape of the crack front is usually curved and the crack length measured at both sides of the sheet will be different. In view of fatigue crack growth predictions it then is necessary to obtain stress intensity factors for such slant and curved crack fronts. In the present investigation this problem has been explored for a simple configuration, which is an open hole in a sheet specimen subjected to combined tension and bending. Fatigue tests were carried out on specimens of AL 2024 T 3 clad sheet material with three different thicknesses (1. 0, 1. 6 and 2. 0 mm). In each specimen a single open <b>countersunk</b> <b>hole</b> was present. The development of the crack front is these specimens could be recorded because so-called marker load cycles were applied in these tests. It then was possible to observe the crack fronts in the scanning electron microscope, which still was a rather strenuous work. Reconstruction of the crack growth could be done for the larger part of the fatigue cracks. K-values were obtained for a large variety of crack front shapes and crack sizes. Comparison of the new calculated K values with existing solutions showed that the new solutions capture near the surface phenomenon more accurately than the previously published data. The improvement is a result of using an increased mesh density. For through the thickness cracks growing away from the <b>countersunk</b> <b>hole,</b> the normalized stress intensity factors approach the values of the normalized stress intensity factors for cracks emanating from a straight shank hole. Thus, the effect of the <b>countersunk</b> <b>hole</b> decreases with increasing crack length. The solutions for the pin loading b values show a dominant influence of the countersunk shape in the b/t values. Residual strength Static failure of a joint occurs when that joint is not able to carry the applied load anymore. The type of static failure in joints depends on the loading condition and the joint configuration. The most common static failure modes in monolithic aluminum joints are fastener shear failure, plate tension failure, bearing failure and plate shear failure. In Glare joints another failure mechanism, fastener pull-through, is often observed. This failure mechanism is related to the lower stiffness of Glare in thickness direction, leading to increased tilting of the fasteners and hence increased tensile stresses in the fastener. In the present thesis, a method is proposed to calculate the residual strength of joints of monolithic and fiber metal laminates. The method uses the remaining net section. For the fiber metal laminates the net section includes the remaining intact metal layers in combination with the intact fibers. The method starts with the blunt notch strength of the un cracked joint and the metal volume fraction for the fiber-metal laminates. The Norris failure criterion and the metal volume fraction are used to calculate the blunt notch strength for any possible Glare lay up. Secondary bending has a significant influence on the ultimate strength of both Glare and aluminum. The ultimate tensile strength reduces with increasing bending. Taking this into account, an empirically found reduction of 10...|$|E

40|$|Crack {{initiation}} in notched elements occurs {{very early}} in the fatigue life. This is also true for riveted lap joints, an important fatigue critical element of a pressurized fuselage structure. Crack nucleation in a riveted lap joint can occur at different locations, depending on the riveting operation.

40|$|During the {{production}} of aerospace components, many time consuming and complicated manual processes are included. ● Drilling holes through composite and alloy ● <b>Countersinking</b> of <b>holes</b> ● Mounting bolts and nuts The general task {{is to look at}} how these processes can be automated. In agreement with KDA, we have chosen to mainly look at the process of automating the bolt assembly process, after the drilling and countersinking process is completed. Although we are only looking at this operation, KDA preferably wants a product that can complete the entire process, so it is important for us to design our product with the entire process in mind...|$|R
40|$|The ONCE robotic {{drilling}} system utilizes a mass produced, {{high capacity}} industrial robot as the motion platform for an automated drilling, <b>countersinking,</b> and <b>hole</b> inspection machine for {{the skin to}} substructure join on the F/A- 18 E/F Super Hornet wing trailing edge flaps (TEF). Historically, robots have lacked the accuracy, payload capacity, and stiffness required for aerospace drilling applications. Recent improvements in positional accuracy and payload capacity, along with position and stiffness compensation, have enabled the robot to become an effective motion platform. Coupled with a servo-controlled multifunction end effector (MFEE), hole locations have successfully been placed within the specification's +/- 0. 060 &quot; tolerance. The hole diameter...|$|R
