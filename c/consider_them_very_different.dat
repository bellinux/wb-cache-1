50|$|Despite {{its great}} {{popularity}} in Lower Canada {{as well as}} in the West, there was a slow-down in its production. That was probably due to the decline of the fur trade in 1870 and in part to the suggestion of the parish priest Tancrède Viger to the weavers, to stop producing, <b>considering</b> <b>them</b> <b>very</b> badly paid for their work.|$|R

60|$|I suppose Janet {{is really}} {{glad that the}} sailor did turn up and claim Lizzie, but she is annoyed in a way too. The fact is that Janet was skeptical about the sailor. I never saw Janet reading {{anything}} but the Free Church Monthly, yet she must have obtained her wide knowledge of sailors from books.

50|$|The GUGB had {{a unique}} system of ranks, {{a blend of}} position-rank system used {{in the army and}} {{personal}} ranks used in Militsiya; the rank insignia was also very distinct. Even though insignia introduced in 1937 followed the Red Army collar patch patterns, it assigned <b>them</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> ranks for GUGB and Internal Troops/political/specialist branches, with GUGB rank placed at least one grade higher than a similar army equivalent.|$|R

50|$|There is a sharp {{consequence}} to the entanglement of the Way - Alternate Universes {{accessed by}} Gates, and to worlds {{such as that}} of the Frants (Timbl), Talsit and Jarts, must by definition share a certain amount of entanglement, even in a most fractional percentage. It is therefore fair to say that these worlds are in fact alternates universes and versions of Earth, though divergence and near-complete lack of similarity in fact make <b>them</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> indeed.|$|R

60|$|Now this exactly {{described}} the places the Bittern prefers to all others; but, as he really <b>considered</b> <b>them</b> <b>very</b> captivating, and hated the very sight of mankind, {{he did not}} feel abashed by the Pelican's stinging rebuke, and perhaps took it for a compliment; and there is no knowing how long he would have staid there, if a frisky little Hoopoe had not chanced to alight on a tree that had fallen across a foaming brook not very far from the group of birds.|$|R

There is an old saying in Turkey that there are [...] "120 ways to string a bow," [...] though the most common methods involve sitting on ground with one's feet pressed against the grip.

60|$|Mr. George and Rollo, after this, walked {{about the}} deck of the ship for some time, looking at the various family groups that were {{scattered}} here and there, and holding conversations with many of the people. The persons whom they talked with all looked up with an expression of great animation and pleasure in their countenances when they learned that their visitors were Americans, and seemed much gratified to see them.

50|$|There are {{two major}} see-through display technologies, LCD and LED. The LCD {{technology}} is older, though OLED see-through displays are becoming more widely available. Both technologies are largely derivative from conventional display systems, but in see-through displays {{the difference between the}} absorptive nature of the LCD and emissive nature of the OLED gives <b>them</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> visual appearances. LCD systems impose a pattern of shading and colors on the background seen through the display, while OLED systems impose a glowing image pattern on the background.|$|R

6000|$|It is {{remarkable}} {{that throughout the}} world the races which are almost completely destitute of a beard dislike hairs on the face and body, and take pains to eradicate them.

Mr. Veitch states that the Japanese ladies “all objected to our whiskers, <b>considering</b> <b>them</b> <b>very</b> ugly, and told us to cut them off, and be like Japanese men.” The New Zealanders are beardless; they carefully pluck out the hairs on the face, and have a saying that “There is no woman for a hairy man.”[435] ...|$|R

40|$|The genus Piscirickettsia {{is part of}} the Piscirickettsiaceae family, {{belonging}} to the Gammaproteobacteria class within the Thiotrichales order. The family contains seven phylogenetically related genera (Cycloclasticus, Hydrogenovibrio, Sulfurivirga, Thioalkalimicrobium, Methylophaga, Thiomicrospira, and Piscirickettsia), with highly diverse characteristics, making <b>them</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> from one another. The genus Piscirickettsia comprises a single species called Piscirickettsia salmonis, a Gram-negative facultative intracellular fish pathogen that significantly affects the salmon industry. Since its first isolation in Chile in 1989, the bacterium has been reported in Norway, Scotland, Greece, Canada, and the USA, among others. To date, the complete genome sequence of P. salmonis has not been reported, and relevant aspects of its metabolism, virulence, and life cycle are still poorly understood...|$|R

Kajak turns out to be somewhat sour on earthmen, including his own son-in-law, presenting a picture of <b>them</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> from that of Burroughs. He regards Carter as something of a blowhard, claiming impossible prowess in battle, and Ulysses Paxton, the other earthman resident on Barsoom, as a rabble-rouser, advocating Terran ideas of equality and freedom unwelcome to the hierarchical, slave-owning Martians.|$|R

Therefore there is no explicit feedback available for a future event. Moreover, there is a very short description provided for each event and thus the keywords play a more than usual important role in categorizing each event. We provide a hybrid algorithm that utilizes content-based and collaborative filtering recommendations. We also present an axiomatic analysis of our model.
