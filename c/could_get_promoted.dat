40|$|Low {{emittance}} of not-fully-stripped gold (Z= 79) Au{sup + 77 } Helium-like ion beams {{from the}} AGS (Alternating Gradient Synchrotron) injector to the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) {{could be attributed}} to the cooling phenomenon due to inelastic intrabeam scattering [1, 2] or due to electron de-excitations from collisions with the residual gas [3]. The low emittance gold beams have always been observed at injection in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). There have been previous attempts to attribute the low emittance to a cooling due to the exchange of energy between ions during the inelastic intrabeam scattering. The Fano-Lichten theory [4] of electron promotion might be applied during inelastic collisions between helium like gold ions in the AGS. The two K-shell electrons in gold Au{sup + 77 } <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>promoted</b> if the ions reach the critical distance of the closest approach during intra-beam scattering or collisions with the residual gas. During collisions if the ion energy is large enough, a quasi-molecule could be formed, and electron excitation could occur. During de-excitations of electrons, photons are emitted and a loss of total bunch energy could occur. This would lead to smaller beam size. We propose to inject gold ions with two missing electrons into RHIC, at injection energy, and study the beam behavior with bunched and de-bunched beam, varying the RF voltage and the beam intensity. If the ''cooling'' is observed additional X-ray detectors could be installed to observe emitted photons...|$|E

The club managed to reach {{the final of the}} Division Two Challenge Cup in the 2002-03 season, which saw them finish 6th in the league, they missed out to league champions and local rivals Rye & Iden United. The club finished in 3rd in 2006-07, however due to having no floodlights at their home ground, <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> <b>promoted</b> into Division One.|$|R
5000|$|With the {{introduction}} of the four Regionalligas in 1994, the system for promotion was somewhat simpler. The champions of the Regionalligas Süd and West/Südwest were always directly promoted. The Regionalligas Nord and Nordost were considered a single entity for the purpose of promotion, therefore only one of the two winners <b>could</b> <b>get</b> directly <b>promoted.</b> From 1996, the two winners of the league had to play a home-and-away decider. The reason for this was that each of the first two Regionalligas covered areas with a population and playing strength roughly equal to the combined second two. The fourth promotion spot was allocated the following way: ...|$|R
50|$|The 2011-12 {{season was}} the best ever season in the club history. Being the newly {{promoted}} team with any experiences in Second Division, the club had not only kept the players, but also signed more ex-First Division such as Lo Chun Kit and Colly Barnes Ezeh. As an underdog {{at the beginning of}} the season, they performed unexpectedly well, having chance to promote to the First Division. Although they <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> <b>promoted,</b> they still placed in the fourth place, only 7 points behind Southern District, the runner-up of the league which <b>get</b> <b>promoted.</b> They performed well in cup competition too. They defeated Hong Kong Football Club, Fire Services, Shatin and Wing Yee to reach the final of the Junior Challenge Shield. Their season culminated in victory over Happy Valley 3-0 to claim the Junior Challenge Shield at Hong Kong Stadium on 18 February 2012.|$|R
50|$|Pich's {{top class}} {{performances}} in the Polish League didn't go unnoticed by Europe's big clubs. At {{the start of the}} 2015 season, German giants Kaiserslautern decided to buy him, so that he <b>could</b> help them <b>get</b> <b>promoted</b> from the Bundesliga second division. However, Pich found the competition for places tough at Kaiserslautern. After a few months, he was loaned back to Śląsk Wrocław where he played well again. Pich's loan ended in the summer in 2016 and he returned to Kaiserslautern. He managed to finally get more regular appearances for Kaiserslautern {{at the start of the}} 2016 season. His good performances also earned him a call up to the Slovakian national team.|$|R

However, thanks to a merger with Borsod Volán SE the club could play in the third division in the 2000-01 season of the Hungarian League. Although the club <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> <b>promoted</b> into the second division, Diósgyőr could play in the second division again in the 2001-02 season since they merged with Bőcs who already got promoted to the second division. In the second league financial problems also hindered {{the success of the}} club and finally the club went bankrupt again. However, the Diósgyőri VTK 1910 Limited company was founded and later purchased the right to play in the second division from Monor. In 2003-04 the club was promoted to the first division of the Hungarian League, although due to financial problems the club was able to play in the first league {{with the help of the}} Siófok KC Ltd. who moved to Miskolc.|$|R
50|$|A typical {{career path}} for {{becoming}} a guitar technician via {{on the job}} training is to begin by volunteering in a bar band and then working for low wages in a regional touring act or a minor touring act. As they gain experience and add skills, they may seek out better-paying jobs with higher-status touring bands. Once a guitar technician has joined the road crew of a major touring act, they may seek out promotions within this organization, to jobs with greater responsibilities and higher pay. For example, a guitar tech who works as an assistant technician <b>could</b> try to <b>get</b> <b>promoted</b> to a guitar technician for the lead guitarist. A guitar tech who completes a guitar repair program at a college or lutherie school may be able to enter midway up the guitar tech career ladder.|$|R
