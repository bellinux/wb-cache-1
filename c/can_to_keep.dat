My brother talked to me all day long about Cambridge, and what he thought I ought to do. My imagination was fired.

Later, while under Mukherji’s leadership, the agency came under fire for its strict “One-Strike” eviction policy, enabled by federal legislation enacted under President Clinton, allowing housing authorities to evict entire households where a resident is charged with a serious crime (without being convicted). While defending the legislation, Mukherji convened public hearings prior to ordering an overhaul of the One-Strike policy, telling Jersey City Independent that the policy had “served as a deterrent and important tool to reduce drug-related and violent criminal activity in public housing (…but) certain revisions may be appropriate to ensure an equitable policy and eviction process… We want to be fair and equitable to criminal defendants, as the presumption of innocence must be sacrosanct, while being mindful that our foremost responsibility is to do all that we <b>can</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> our tenants safe.” ...|$|E
