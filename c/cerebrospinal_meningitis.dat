5000|$|Common {{treatments}} for Nelson's syndrome include radiation or surgical procedure. Radiation {{allows for the}} limitation {{of the growth of}} the pituitary gland and the adenomas. If the adenomas start to affect the surrounding structures of the brain, then a micro-surgical technique can be adapted in order to remove the adenomas in a transsphenoidal (bone at base of the skull) process. Death may result with development of a locally aggressive pituitary tumor. However, does not commonly occur with pituitary diseases. In the rare case, ACTH-secreting tumors can become malignant. Morbidity from the disease can occur due to pituitary tissue compression or replacement, and compression of structures that surround the pituitary fossa. [...] The tumor can also compress the optic apparatus, disturb <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid flow, <b>meningitis,</b> and testicular enlargement in rare cases.|$|R
50|$|A lumbar {{puncture}} (LP) {{is necessary to}} diagnose <b>meningitis.</b> <b>Cerebrospinal</b> fluid (CSF) culture {{is the most important}} study for the diagnosis of neonatal bacterial meningitis because clinical signs are non-specific and unreliable. Blood cultures may be negative in 15-55% of cases, deeming it unreliable as well. However, a CSF/blood glucose ratio below two-thirds has a strong relationship to bacterial meningitis. A LP should be done in all neonates with suspected meningitis, with suspected or proven sepsis (whole body inflammation) and should be considered in all neonates in whom sepsis is a possibility. The role of the LP in neonates who are healthy appearing but have maternal risk factors for sepsis is more controversial; the yield of the LP in these patients may be low.Early-onset is deemed when infection is within one week of birth. Late-onset is deemed after the first week.|$|R

50|$|These {{procedures}} normally {{relieve the}} pressure on the surrounding brain regions and lead to a lowering of GH levels. Surgery is most successful in patients with blood GH levels below 40 ng/ml before the operation and with pituitary tumors no larger than 10 mm in diameter. Success depends on the skill and experience of the surgeon. The success rate also depends on what level of GH is defined as a cure. The best measure of surgical success is normalization of GH and IGF-1 levels. Ideally, GH should be less than 2 ng/ml after an oral glucose load. A review of GH levels in 1,360 patients worldwide immediately after surgery revealed that 60% had random GH levels below 5 ng/ml. Complications of surgery may include <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid leaks, <b>meningitis,</b> or damage to the surrounding normal pituitary tissue, requiring lifelong pituitary hormone replacement.|$|R
