In March 2005, TxDOT and ACS-Zachry signed a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>development</b> agreement which authorized $3.5 million of planning for TTC-35. This agreement did not designate the alignment, authorize construction, set toll rates or who collects them, and did not eliminate competition for future services. There were no contracts awarded to develop or finance any other corridor.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} {{institutional}} development, the government {{decided to return}} to the earlier structure of creating two separate autonomous agencies in charge of the water sector. In 1977, it created by law the Jordan Valley Authority (JVA) by merging the JVC and parts of other organizations, charging it with the <b>comprehensive</b> <b>development</b> of the Jordan Valley. In 1983, through another law it created the Water Authority of Jordan (WAJ), responsible for drinking water supply and sanitation in Jordan. Inititally, the heads of both Authorities had the rank of Ministers and reported directly to the Primer Minister, until the Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MWI) was created in 1988 bringing the two agencies under it.|$|E
25|$|In 1961, a Water Resources Development Promotion Law was passed. On its basis {{over the}} next decade seven river basins with high growth in water needs were {{designated}} for water resources development and investments in dams, weirs and inter-basin transfers was undertaken on the basis of <b>comprehensive</b> <b>development</b> plans for each basin. During the 1970s and 80s numerous dams were thus built to provide storage to avoid future water scarcity and to supply the growing cities with sufficient water. However, the construction of some dams was substantially delayed. For example, construction of the dam forming what is today Lake Miyagase was begun in 1971, but {{for a number of reasons}} including the need to resettle 300 households, the dam was only completed in 2000. Beginning in the 1960s investment in waste water treatment was initiated. In 1993 the Environmental Law was passed and subsequently legislation was passed to protect the headwaters of rivers, thus gradually shifting from a curative approach to a preventative approach of water quality management.|$|E

25|$|New Regent Street is a {{pedestrian}} mall in Christchurch. Built {{as a private}} development in the early 1930s with 40 shops in Spanish Mission architectural style, {{it is one of}} the city's major tourist attractions. Providing a number of small shops as a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>development</b> was an advanced idea at the time, and New Regent Street is regarded as a forerunner to modern shopping malls. Due to its coherent architectural character, the buildings in the streets are listed as Category I heritage items by Heritage New Zealand, and in addition, the entire street has a historic area listing. The street was pedestrianised in 1994 in preparation for the introduction of the , which began operation in February 1995. Damaged in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, the street and buildings reopened in April 2013, and the tram returned from November of that year. Following the 2016 Valentine's Day earthquake, five of the buildings that had not been repaired after the previous earthquakes have been cordoned off, which stopped the tram from operating on its original heritage loop until May.|$|E
25|$|In 1929, {{businessman}} {{and chairman of}} The Press, George Gould, proposed a variety of measures to relieve traffic congestion in Colombo Street and Cathedral Square, including a new bridge over the Avon River connecting Oxford Terrace with Durham Street south, and a new diagonal street from the Armagh Street / Manchester Street intersection to Gloucester Street near its intersection with Colombo Street. The latter proposal would have required the demolition of the Colosseum. Gould suggested this diagonal street be called Little High Street, {{in reference to the}} diagonal High Street further south in the central city. Only two weeks after Gould's proposal, a group of businessman led by Arthur Francis Stacey put a proposal for a new street with a Spanish theme to Christchurch City Council's town planning committee. The group had secured options on the Colosseum and on those two properties that separated the Colosseum from access onto Armagh Street. The plans had been drawn by Francis Willis, who had previously been employed by Christchurch City Council as their architect, but who had since 1924 been self-employed. Stacey and his business partners had formed a company called Regent Street Limited in 1929; other company directors were David Manson, Alexander Hamilton Forbes, and John Joseph Dougall. By February 1930, the project had been approved in principle by Christchurch City Council. The concept of a number of small shops all built as a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>development</b> was advanced for its time, and can be regarded as the forerunner of modern shopping malls.|$|E

2500|$|The {{concept of}} Human capital has {{relatively}} more importance in labour-surplus countries. These countries are naturally endowed {{with more of}} labour due to high birth rate under the given climatic conditions. The surplus labour in these countries is the human resource available in more abundance than the tangible capital resource. This human resource can be transformed into Human capital with effective inputs of education, health and moral values. The transformation of raw human resource into highly productive human resource with these inputs {{is the process of}} human capital formation. The problem of scarcity of tangible capital in the labour surplus countries can be resolved by accelerating the rate of human capital formation with both private and public investment in education and health sectors of their National economies. The tangible financial capital is an effective instrument of promoting economic growth of the nation. The intangible human capital, on the other hand, is an instrument of promoting <b>comprehensive</b> <b>development</b> of the nation because human capital is directly related to human development, and when there is human development, the qualitative and quantitative progress of the nation is inevitable. This importance of human capital is explicit in the changed approach of United Nations towards comparative evaluation of economic development of different nations in the World economy. United Nations publishes Human Development Report on human development in different nations with the objective of evaluating the rate of human capital formation in these nations.|$|E
