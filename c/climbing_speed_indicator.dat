40|$|Studies of whole-organism {{performance}} {{are central to}} understanding the links between animal behaviour, morphology, and fitness. Invertebrates have been popular models for studies of behaviour, {{although there have been}} few detailed studies of their whole-organism performance, links between performance and morphology, or trade-offs amongst different performance dimensions. In the present study, we investigate four facets of whole-organism performance (running <b>speed,</b> <b>climbing</b> <b>speed,</b> endurance, and pulling force) in males of a jumping spider (Servaea incana). We consider links between these performance traits and their association with three morphological measures expected to influence maximum performance capacity: body size, relative leg length, and relative body mass (condition). Running <b>speed,</b> <b>climbing</b> <b>speed,</b> and pulling force were all positively related, suggesting that selection for one may positively effect all. By contrast, endurance capacity decreased with running and <b>climbing</b> <b>speed,</b> suggesting an evolutionary trade-off. Associations amongst performance measures cannot be explained solely as correlates of morphology: large size was associated with greater running <b>speed,</b> <b>climbing</b> <b>speed,</b> and pulling force but not with endurance; relative leg length was associated with pulling force but not other performance traits; relative mass was associated with <b>climbing</b> <b>speed</b> and endurance but not running speed or pulling force. 14 page(s...|$|R

50|$|A pilot {{aiming for}} a 500-foot per minute descent, for example, may find himself {{descending}} too rapidly. He begins to apply up elevator until the vertical <b>speed</b> <b>indicator</b> shows 500 feet per minute. However, because the vertical <b>speed</b> <b>indicator</b> lags the actual vertical speed, the pilot is actually descending at much less than 500 feet per minute. The pilot then begins applying down elevator until the vertical <b>speed</b> <b>indicator</b> reads 500 feet per minute, starting the cycle over. It's harder than it might seem to stabilize the vertical speed because the airspeed also constantly changes.|$|R
40|$|The {{competitive}} market will keep asking airlines for better services and lower prices, imposing pressure on costs. Therefore, {{it is important}} for an airline to establish operational standards that will allow an aircraft to be operated more efficiently. The implementation of the Economic Speeds defined by the Cost Index can represent significant operating cost reductions when compared to simply flying Fixed Speeds. Different aircraft models today are equipped with Flight Management Computers (FMC) that are capable of automatically calculating the Economic Speeds based on the Airline Cost Index. In the other hand, several aircraft types manufactured by world leading companies and flown by many airlines around the globe are equipped with FMCs that do not have this capability. Accordingly, this work focuses on the Economic Speeds defined by the Cost Index. More specifically, the Cost Index Methodology is discussed and its fundamentals are applied to the climb phase of the flight. Finally, a methodology for the generation of a practical guidance that allows the determination of the Economic <b>Climb</b> <b>Speed</b> Schedule during the daily operation is presented, allowing an airline with a fleet equipped with FMCs not capable of automatically calculating the Economic <b>Climb</b> <b>Speed</b> Schedule {{to take advantage of the}} potential operating cost reduction. The proposed methodology can be applied on the development of a calculation software to be installed on an Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) or to be used for generating data to be sent directly to the flight crew in the cockpit through a Datalink System. In case an EFB or a Datalink System are not an alternative, the proposed methodology leads to the Economic <b>Climb</b> <b>Speed</b> Schedule Table, a practical guidance that allows the flight crew to determine the Economic <b>Climb</b> <b>Speed</b> Schedule for an Airline Cost Index and different conditions of aircraft weight, cruise altitude and speed, with corrections for temperature and wind variations. Since corrections for temperature and wind variations can be understood as a simplification that permits the Economic <b>Climb</b> <b>Speed</b> Schedules to be presented through a table, it is necessary to investigate the impact of this simplification on the optimization. Therefore, the operating costs for an aircraft flying the Economic <b>Climb</b> <b>Speed</b> Schedule calculated for each specific condition is compared with that same aircraft flying the speeds obtained from the suggested Table. Finally, a Study Case analyses the impact on the operating costs for an aircraft flying the speeds obtained from the Economic <b>Climb</b> <b>Speed</b> Schedule Table in comparison with flying a Fixed <b>Climb</b> <b>Speed</b> Schedule...|$|R

40|$|The gravity {{hypothesis}} of sexual size dimorphism {{can explain the}} patterns of extreme sexual size dimorphism in spiders (males smaller than females) because small males climb faster and therefore may be better at reaching females that live in high habitats. Recently, the main prediction of a negative relationship between <b>climbing</b> <b>speed</b> and body size in spiders has been called into question. Here we induced males and females of the spider Leucauge venusta (Tetragnathidae) to run on vertical surfaces and found partial support for the gravity hypothesis. As predicted, males climb faster than females and we demonstrated that this effect is an indirect effect mediated by the negative relationship between body mass and <b>climbing</b> <b>speed.</b> We validate our results using simulated data showing that there is enough statistical efficiency in our data set to support our conclusions. We distinguished between direct and indirect effects (through mass) on sex differences in <b>climbing</b> <b>speed</b> by means of path analysis. Thus, we provide empirical evidence that by being smaller, males are able to climb faster than females. However, we found only a barely significant negative relationship between <b>climbing</b> <b>speed</b> and body size when only males were considered. Reasons for such results are discussed within the text...|$|R
