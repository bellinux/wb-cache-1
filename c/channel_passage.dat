After resting in Paris, the patient had continued her homeward journey as far as Boulogne. In her suffering condition, she was liable to sudden fits of caprice. An insurmountable horror of the <b>Channel</b> <b>passage</b> had got possession of her; she positively refused to be taken on board the steamboat. In this difficulty, the lady who held the post of her [...] "companion" [...] had ventured on a suggestion. Would Lady Berrick consent to make the <b>Channel</b> <b>passage</b> if her nephew came to Boulogne expressly to accompany her on the voyage? The reply had been so immediately favorable, that the doctor lost no time in communicating with Mr. Lewis Romayne. This was the substance of the letter.|$|E

60|$|For {{the rest}} of the journey Miss Winchelsea talked little, and what she said was as {{pleasant}} and as stamped with refinement as she could make it. Her voice was always low and clear and pleasant, and she took care that on this occasion it was particularly low and clear and pleasant. As they came under the white cliffs the young man put his book of poetry away, and when at last the train stopped beside the boat, he displayed a graceful alacrity with the impedimenta of Miss Winchelsea and her friends. Miss Winchelsea hated nonsense, but she was pleased to see the young man perceived at once that they were ladies, and helped them without any violent geniality; and how nicely he showed that his civilities were to be no excuse for further intrusions. None of her little party had been out of England before, and they were all excited and a little nervous at the <b>Channel</b> <b>passage.</b> They stood in a little group in a good place near the middle of the boat--the young man had taken Miss Winchelsea's carry-all there and had told her it was a good place--and they watched the white shores of Albion recede and quoted Shakespeare and made quiet fun of their fellow travellers in the English way.|$|E
60|$|Most {{persons who}} have crossed from Dover to Calais, or vice versa, by the Calais-Douvre mail packet, will bear witness both to the comfort and speed of that vessel. Up to this she has proved the most perfect form of steam-ship yet {{constructed}} for the purpose required. The Calais-Douvre is built somewhat upon the same principle as the Castalia, but differs from that vessel in that whereas the latter was two half-ships joined together, each twin-portion of the Calais-Douvre is a perfect ship in itself. The result has been, that while the Castalia was a failure, the Calais-Douvre has proved a distinct success. She is three hundred feet in length and sixty feet in breadth; her tonnage is two thousand, and her water-draught only six feet, {{so that she can}} enter Calais Harbour at even a low tide. Two transverse iron girder bulk-heads unite the two hulls of the vessel; and her steering apparatus is so simple, {{and at the same time}} so effective in construction, that one wheel is usually sufficient to work it. She makes the passage from Dover to Calais usually in an hour and a half; but in very fine weather we ourselves have crossed in less than that time. With the maximum rate of speed, the Calais-Douvre has attained the minimum amount of pitching and rolling yet secured by any Channel boat. Her saloons, cabins, and decks are spacious and handsomely appointed, so that the <b>Channel</b> <b>passage</b> in this vessel is made under as favourable conditions for bad sailors as any sea-passage can be.|$|E

6000|$|Miss Winchelsea {{was going}} to Rome. The matter had filled her mind {{for a month or}} more, and had overflowed so abundantly into her {{conversation}} that quite {{a number of people who}} were not going to Rome, and who were not likely to go to Rome, had made it a personal grievance against her. Some indeed had attempted quite unavailingly to convince her that Rome was not nearly such a desirable place as it was reported to be, and others had gone so far as to suggest behind her back that she was dreadfully [...] "stuck up" [...] about [...] "that Rome of hers." [...] And little Lily Hardhurst had told her friend Mr. Binns that so far as she was concerned Miss Winchelsea might [...] "go to her old Rome and stop there; she (Miss Lily Hardhurst) wouldn't grieve." [...] And the way in which Miss Winchelsea put herself upon terms of personal tenderness with Horace and Benvenuto Cellini and Raphael and Shelley and Keats--if she had been Shelley's widow she could not have professed a keener interest in his grave--was a matter of universal astonishment. Her dress was a triumph of tactful discretion, sensible, but not too [...] "touristy"'--Miss Winchelsea had a great dread of being [...] "touristy"--and her Baedeker was carried in a cover of grey to hide its glaring red. She made a prim and pleasant little figure on the Charing Cross platform, in spite of her swelling pride, when at last the great day dawned, and she could start for Rome. The day was bright, the <b>Channel</b> <b>passage</b> would be pleasant, and all the omens promised well. There was the gayest sense of adventure in this unprecedented departure.|$|E
60|$|When {{the nurse}} reached {{home with the}} little {{carriage}} it was almost dark, and, snatching up the child, {{she ran to the}} nursery without meeting any one. The child felt heavy, but she was in such a hurry she scarcely noticed that. She put it upon the bed, and then lighting the gas she unwrapped the afghan, in which the little creature was now almost entirely enveloped. When she saw the face, and the black hair, from which the cap had fallen off, she was nearly frightened to death, but, fortunately for herself, she did not scream. She was rather a stupid woman, with but few ideas, but she could not fail to see that some one had taken her charge, and put this child in its place. Her first impulse was to run back to the gardens, but she felt certain that her baby had been carried off; and, besides, she could not, without discovery, leave the child here or take it with her; and while she stood in dumb horror, her mistress sent for her. The lady was just going out to dinner, and told the nurse that, as they were all to start for the Continent by the tidal train, which left at ten o'clock that night, she must be ready with the baby, well wrapped up for the journey. The half-stupefied woman had no words nor courage with which to declare, at this moment, the true state of the case. She said nothing, {{and went back to the}} nursery and sat there in dumb consternation, and without sense enough to make a plan of any kind. The strange child soon awoke and began to cry, and then the nurse mechanically fed it, and it went to sleep again. When the summons came to her to prepare for the journey, in cowardly haste she wrapped the baby, so carefully covering its head that she scarcely gave it a chance to breathe; and she and the lady's waiting-maid were sent in a cab to the Victoria Station. The lady was travelling with a party of friends, and the nurse and the waiting-maid were placed in the adjoining compartment of the railway-carriage. On the six hours' <b>channel</b> <b>passage</b> from Newhaven to Dieppe the lady was extremely sick, and reached France in such a condition that she had to be almost carried on shore. It had been her intention to stop a few days at this fashionable watering-place, but she declared that she must go straight on to Paris, where she could be properly attended to, and, moreover, that she never wanted to see the sea again. When she had been placed in the train for Paris she sent for the nurse, and feebly asked how the baby was, and if it had been seasick. On being told that it was all right, and had not shown a sign of illness, she expressed her gratification, and lay back among her rugs.|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} study of the flow behavior inside the channels of an 8 -blade backswept low specific speed impeller at design and off-design conditions is presented.

The results demonstrated a well behaved flow with no evidence of flow separation at the design condition. The fluid flow inside the impeller channel started experiencing a flow separation, when the flow rate is reduced, which propagated throughout the <b>channel</b> <b>passage</b> and caused the channel to stall with a large recirculation zone at severe off-design flow rates...|$|E

40|$|Air {{quality in}} {{aircraft}} cabins {{has long been}} criticized. Current widely-used air distribution systems on airplanes dilute inside generated pollutants by promoting air mixing and thus impose risks of infectious airborne disease transmission. In addition, low moisture content in cabin {{is believed to be}} responsible for headache, tiredness and lots of other unknown symptoms. To restrict air mixing while improving air humidity level, this investigation uses a validated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program to design a new under-aisle displacement air distribution system for wide-body aircraft cabins. The new system supplies fully conditioned outside air at moderate momentum through a narrow <b>channel</b> <b>passage</b> along both side cabin walls to middle height of the cabin just beneath the stowage bins, while simultaneously humid air is supplied through both perforated under aisles. By comparing with the current mixing air distribution system in terms of distribution of CO 2 concentration, relative humidity, velocity and temperature, the new system is found being capable of lessening the inhaled CO 2 concentration by 30 % and can improve the relative humidity from currently 12 % to 22 % without causing draught risks and moisture condensation on cabin walls...|$|E

The archetypal channel pore is {{just one or two}} atoms wide at its narrowest point and is selective for specific species of ion, such as sodium or potassium. However, some channels may be permeable to the passage of more than one type of ion, typically sharing a common charge: positive (cations) or negative (anions). Ions often move through the segments of the channel pore in single file nearly as quickly as the ions move through free solution.
