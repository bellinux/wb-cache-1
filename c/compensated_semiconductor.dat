40|$|Variable-range hopping {{conductivity}} {{has long}} been {{understood in terms of}} a canonical prescription for relating the single-particle density of states to the temperature-dependent conductivity. Here we demonstrate that this prescription breaks down in situations where a large and long-ranged random potential develops. In particular, we examine a canonical model of a completely <b>compensated</b> <b>semiconductor,</b> and we show that at low temperatures hopping proceeds along self-organized, low-dimensional subspaces having fractal dimension $d = 2 $. We derive and study numerically the spatial structure of these subspaces, as well as the conductivity and density of states that result from them. One of our prominent findings is that fractal ordering of low energy sites greatly enhances the hopping conductivity, and allows Efros-Shklovskii type conductivity to persist up to unexpectedly high temperatures.

40|$|The {{study of}} the {{steady-state}} and time resolved photoluminescence of 2 H-MoS 2 :Cl 2 and 2 H-WS 2 :Br 2 crystals is presented. For both investigated materials two distinct spectral regions was identified: the excitonic region, located {{in the vicinity of}} the indirect band gap and consisting of several sharp zero-phonon lines and their phonon replica, and the vibronic broad band IR region, characteristic also for natural crystals without halogen impurities. The thermal quenching of the exciton emission at T> 60 K was also observed. The strong sharp photoluminescence line of the indirect band gap semiconductors is attributed to the recombination of excitons bound on electron-attractive neutral centers, formed due to the intercalation of the halogen molecules in the van der Waals gap of the layered compound.

40|$|The topological {{insulator}} BiSbTeSe_ 2 {{corresponds to}} a <b>compensated</b> <b>semiconductor</b> in which strong Coulomb disorder {{gives rise to the}} formation of charge puddles, i. e., local accumulations of charge carriers, both in the bulk and on the surface. Bulk puddles are formed if the fluctuations of the Coulomb potential are as large as half of the band gap. The gapless surface, in contrast, is sensitive to small fluctuations but the potential is strongly suppressed due to the additional screening channel provided by metallic surface carriers. To study the quantitative relationship between the properties of bulk puddles and surface puddles, we performed infrared transmittance measurements as well as scanning tunneling microscopy measurements on the same sample of BiSbTeSe_ 2, which is close to perfect compensation. At 5. 5 K, we find surface potential fluctuations occurring on a length scale r_s = 40 - 50 nm with amplitude Γ = 8 - 14 meV which is much smaller than in the bulk, where optical measurements detect the formation of bulk puddles. In this nominally undoped compound, the value of Γ is smaller than expected for pure screening by surface carriers, and we argue that this arises most likely from a cooperative effect of bulk screening and surface screening.

40|$|Thin-film {{solar cells}} are {{promising}} for renewable-energy applications {{due to their}} low material usage and inexpensive manufacturing potential, making them compatible with terawatts-level deployment. Cuprous oxide (Cu₂O) is an earthabundant semiconductor with desirable properties for light-absorbing layers. However, power conversion efficiencies of solar cells comprising this absorber material remain significantly below the theoretical limit. In this thesis, I utilize novel materials and device geometries to engineer defects in Cu₂O thin-films and overcome the low power-conversion-efficiency of Cu 20 -based solar cells. First, nitrogen doping is proposed as an effective p-type doping method to control optical and electrical properties of Cu₂O thin-films. The film's p-type conductivity is elucidated by temperature-dependent Hall effect measurements and a <b>compensated</b> <b>semiconductor</b> model. Secondly, an atomic-layer-deposited amorphous zinc-tin-oxide buffer layer is developed to mitigate non-ideal band alignment and interfacial defect-assisted recombination in Cu₂O - zinc oxide (ZnO) heterojunction devices. Reduced interfacial recombination is demonstrated by incorporating a 5 -nm-thick buffer layer in the device. Finally, I propose a spatially controlled vertical ZnO nanowire array to overcome the short minority carrier diffusion length in Cu₂O. A scalable fabrication process is developed using colloidal lithography and hydrothermal growth of ZnO nanowires.

40|$|In {{compensated}} crystalline and amorphous semiconductors {{long range}} potential fluctuations (PF), at {{the scale of}} the mean free path, largely affect the transport properties : they act on free carriers and they change the average degree of ionization of deep centers. The maximum magnitude of PF varies with the applied field, and the corresponding charge and discharge of deep centers in the bulk, at the frequency of the applied field, contribute to the complex conductivity of the sample. The expressions of the total complex conductivity due to lattice, free carriers and deep centers, and of the complex differential capacitance of a MIS diode, are derived in the general case of a <b>compensated</b> <b>semiconductor</b> with potential fluctuations (PF). These expressions differ significantly from those commonly used when ignoring the existence of PF. This ends up in a new method for the determination of the distribution of gap states which, contrary to other methods, allows to separate the contribution of the localized states from the contribution of band carriers. This method is applied to the interpretation of our data on a-Si: H films grown by CVD. The real and the imaginary parts of the conductivity can be fitted in wide ranges of temperatures and frequencies. The variations of the complex conductivity are completely explained by the action of PF on the transport of free carriers and on the ionization of deep centers.

This effect is essential {{and has to be}} accounted for when developing and producing devices based on the Ge/GaAs heterostructure. All the Ge films under investigation were single-crystalline and epitaxially-grown on the GaAs(100) substrates. However, the transport phenomena in Ge films grown at low and high deposition rate differed drastically. Those obtained at low deposition rate were p-type and high resistant. They had a low concentration of free charge carriers and thermally activated conductivity, which is characteristic of heavily doped and strongly (in the limiting case, fully) <b>compensated</b> <b>semiconductors.</b> Although such films were single-crystalline, their conductivity was percolation-type. The Ge films obtained at high deposition rate were n-type and low resistant. They had high concentration of free charge carriers. The temperature dependence of conductivity in such films was weak or practically absent, which is characteristic of degenerate heavily doped semiconductors. Besides, the surface morphology cardinally differed for films obtained at low and high deposition rate. At low film growth rates, surfaces with developed relief were observed whose valleys and ridges formed grains of irregular shape with pronounced substructure. As the film thickness grew, the surface relief became essentially pronounced. At rather high film deposition rates, contrary to the above, the Ge film surface was fine-grained and smooth; the surface relief practically did not depend on the film thickness. As the deposition rate went down, the intrinsic stresses in films essentially decreased. The results obtained were analyzed from the viewpoint of formation of compositional and morphological inhomogeneities, and fluctuations of electrostatic potential at low growth rates. Such potential fluctuations modulate Ge energy bands leading to appearance of potential relief and deep tails of density of states in the Ge bandgap.

Epitaxial layers of different chemical composition were grown by MOVPE {{in order to}} study fundamental properties of this semiconductor and its device free from the influence of grain boundaries. As a first step the growth parameters for the MOVPE of CuGaSe 2 on GaAs(001) were investigated and the chemical composition was adjusted. Characterization by photoluminescence focussed on two main topics: a) the investigation of excitonic line spectra in quasi-stoichiometric CuGaSe 2 and b) studies concerning optical transitions involving defects in Cu x Ga y Se 2 {{as a function of}} chemical composition. The binding energy of the free exciton was determined to be E FX = (13 ± 2) meV. Radiative recombination from bound excitons was attributed to neutral acceptor bound excitons: (A 0, X). In contradiction to reports in the literature no anomalous temperature dependence of the band gap energy could be deduced from the investigation of the free excitonic line as a function of temperature. Defect-correlated optical transitions were explained in a recombination model consisting of two acceptor and one donor levels showing ionisation energies of (60 ± 10) meV, (100 ± 10) meV and (12 ± 5) meV, respectively.

Absence of (111) peak {{along with the}} presence of a weak (200) peak indicates the antisite disorder of Al with Cr and V atoms. The magnetization measurements reveal a ferrimagnetic transition near 710 K and a coercive field of 100 Oe at 3 K. Very low moment and coercive field indicate fully compensated ferrimagnetism in the alloy. Temperature coefficient of resistivity is found to be negative, indicating a characteristic of semiconducting nature. Absence of exponential dependence of resistivity on temperature indicates a gapless/spin-gapless semiconducting behaviour. Electronic and magnetic properties of CrVTiAl for three possible crystallograpic configurations are studied theoretically. All the three configurations are found to be different forms of semiconductors. Ground state configuration is a fully compensated ferrimagnet with band gaps 0. 58 eV and 0. 30 eV for up and down spin bands respectively. The next higher energy configuration is also ferrimagnetic, but has spin-gapless semiconducting nature. The highest energy configuration corresponds to a non-magnetic gapless semiconductor. The energy differences among these configurations are quite small (< 1 mRy/atom) which hints that at finite temperatures, the alloy exists in a disordered phase, which is a mixture of the three configurations.

The continuing {{development of new}} energy technologies for electronic devices and medical applications necessitates the search for advanced nanomaterials. Among the more promising candidates are two novel materials: nanocrystal (NC) assemblies and three-dimensional (3 D) topological insulators (TIs). The former have great promise for optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices, while the latter can be applied in spintronics and quantum computing. Thus far, however, the development of NC- and TI-based devices have been slowed {{by a lack of}} a solid theoretical understanding of many of their electronic properties, in particular, the influence of the presence of disorder on charge transport. In this thesis we propose to help address this need by performing a detailed, theoretical analysis of the disorder effects on electronic transport properties of NC arrays and TIs. NC assemblies can be made from different materials. Specifically, we consider three types of systems: semiconductor NCs, metallic NCs and superconducting grains. As-grown semiconductor NCs are insulators, and {{in order for them to}} be useful in photovoltaic devices, their electrical conductivity must be tuned by doping. Recent experiments have shown that the resistivity of a dense crystalline array of semiconductor NCs depends in a sensitive way on the level of doping as well as on the NC size and spacing. We show that in sufficiently small NCs, the fluctuations in donor number from one NC to another provide disorder that helps to determine the conduction mechanism in the array. Using this model, we explain how the different regimes of resistivity observed in experiment arise based on the interplay between the charging spectrum of NCs, the long-ranged Coulomb interactions between charged NCs, and the discrete quantum energy levels of confined electrons. We supplement our theory with a computer simulation, which we use to calculate the single particle density of states (DOS) and the resistivity. Compared to semiconductor NCs, the quantum gaps in metallic NCs become negligible and disorder is provided by donors and acceptors that are randomly situated in the interstitial spaces between grains. These changes may lead to different results for electron energy distribution and charge transport. Using a computer simulation we calculate the DOS and the conductivity in 2 D and 3 D arrays of metallic NCs. While the Coulomb gap in the DOS is a universal consequence of electron-electron interaction in disordered systems with localized electron states, we show that for granular metals there is not one but three identical adjacent Coulomb gaps, which together form a structure that we call a ``Coulomb gap triptych. " Furthermore, unlike in the conventional Coulomb glass models, in metallic NC arrays the DOS has a fixed width in the limit of large disorder. The third type of NC assemblies we consider are granular superconductors in the strongly insulating regime, in which the array as a whole is insulating while individual grains may still contain Cooper pairs. In such cases, coherent tunneling is absent. Instead, electronic states are localized and electron conduction proceeds primarily by hopping of electrons between grains through the insulating gaps which separate them. In principle, electronic conduction can occur either through tunneling of single electrons or through simultaneous tunneling of an electron pair (or both). Using a simple computer simulation, we numerically calculate the DOS and conductivity, and study the evolution of conduction mechanism as a function of temperature, charging energy and superconducting gap. The implications of our results for magnetoresistance and tunneling experiments are also discussed. The rest of the thesis discusses another type of disorder system: 3 D TI. The 3 D TI has gapless surface states that are expected to exhibit a range of interesting quantum phenomena. However, as-grown TIs are typically heavily-doped n -type crystals. Compensation by acceptors is used to move the Fermi level to the middle of the band gap, but even then TIs have a frustratingly small bulk resistivity. We show that this small resistivity is the result of band bending by poorly screened fluctuations in the random Coulomb potential. Using numerical simulations of a completely compensated TI, we find that the bulk resistivity has an activation energy of just 0. 15 times the band gap, in good agreement with experimental data. At lower temperatures activated transport crosses over to variable range hopping with a relatively large localization length. We also extend our theory to the more practical case of strongly <b>compensated</b> <b>semiconductors,</b> as in experiments the exact condition of complete compensation is difficult to meet. We calculate the DOS, conductivity and activation energy of a strongly compensated TI as a function of compensation degree. Historically known as good thermoelectric materials, the thermopower properties of compensated TIs are also discussed...|$|R

Native defects are responsible in many cases, but extrinsic dopants may also act {{as their own}} compensation when occupying an alternate lattice site. Suppressing the concentrations of compensating defects during processing close to thermal equilibrium is difficult because formation enthalpies are lowered as the Fermi level moves towards the majority band edge. Excess carriers, introduced for example by photogeneration, modify the formation enthalpy of semiconductor defects and thus can be harnessed during crystal growth or annealing to suppress such defect populations. Herein we develop a rigorous and general model for defect formation {{in the presence of}} steady-state excess carrier concentrations by combining the standard quasi-chemical formalism with a detailed-balance description that is applicable for any defect state in the bandgap. Considering the quasi-Fermi levels as chemical potentials, we demonstrate that increasing the minority carrier concentration increases the formation enthalpy for typical compensating centers, thus suppressing their formation. This effect is illustrated for the specific example of native GaSb antisite acceptors in nominally un-doped and extrinsically n-type doped GaSb. The model also predicts reductions in the concentration of ionized scattering centers as well as increased mobility. While our treatment is generalized for excess carrier injection or generation in semiconductors by any means, we provide a set of guidelines for applying the concept in photoassisted physical vapor deposition...|$|R
