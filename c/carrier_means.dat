40|$|A {{recently}} developed model that unifies the ballistic and diffusive transport mechanisms is applied in a theoretical study of carrier transport across potential barriers at grain boundaries in microcrystalline semiconducting materials. In the unified model, the conductance {{depends on the}} detailed structure of the band edge profile and in a nonlinear way on the <b>carrier</b> <b>mean</b> free path. Equilibrium band edge profiles are calculated within the trapping model for samples {{made up of a}} linear chain of identical grains. Quantum corrections allowing for tunneling are included in the calculation of electron mobilities. The dependence of the mobilities on <b>carrier</b> <b>mean</b> free path, grain length, number of grains, and temperature is examined, and appreciable departures from the results of the thermionic-field-emission model are found. Specifically, the unified model is applied in an analysis of Hall mobility data for n-type microcrystalline Si thin films in the range of thermally activated transport. Owing mainly to the effect of tunneling, potential barrier heights derived from the data are substantially larger than the activation energies of the Hall mobilities. The specific features of the unified model, however, cannot be resolved within the rather large uncertainties of the analysis. Comment: REVTex, 19 pages, 9 figures; to appear in J. Appl. Phy...|$|R

This ground-breaking idea was accomplished in Cu-Ge-Te, NbO2, In-Ga-Zn-O, Zr-Ni-Sn, Si-Au, and Ti-Pb-V-O amorphous systems. It should be mentioned that modelling of transport properties is challenging enough without breaking the long-range order so that design of amorphous thermoelectrics is at its infancy. Naturally, amorphous thermoelectrics give rise to extensive phonon scattering, which is still a challenge for crystalline thermoelectrics. A bright future is expected for these materials.|$|R

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{survey is}} given of the thermoballistic approach to charge carrier transport in semiconductors. This semiclassical approach bridges {{the gap between}} the drift-diffusion and ballistic ("thermionic") models of carrier transport, whose validity is limited to the range of very small and very large values, respectively, of the <b>carrier</b> <b>mean</b> free path. The physical concept underlying the thermoballistic approach, while incorporating basic features of the drift-diffusion and ballistic descriptions, constitutes a novel, unifying scheme. It is based on the introduction of "ballistic configurations" defined by a random partitioning of the length of a semiconducting sample into ballistic transport intervals, which are linked by points of local thermodynamic equilibrium at which carriers are emitted or absorbed. By averaging the carrier currents in the ballistic intervals over all ballistic configurations, a position-dependent thermoballistic current is derived for arbitrary magnitude of the <b>carrier</b> <b>mean</b> free path. This current is the key element of the thermoballistic concept and forms the point of departure of the calculation of various transport quantities. The present article starts out with an account of the standard drift-diffusion and ballistic transport models, and of a prototype model which paves the way for the fully developed form of that concept. In {{the main body of the}} article, a coherent exposition of the thermoballistic approach is given within a general formulation that takes into account arbitrarily shaped, spin-split potential energy profiles and spin relaxation during the carrier motion across ballistic intervals. The calculational procedures devised for implementing the thermoballistic concept are described. Specific examples relevant to present-day semiconductor and spintronics research are considered.
