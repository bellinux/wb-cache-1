Moreover, in patients whose adrenal glands are already maximally stimulated, a stimulation test would not be informative. Furthermore, a short test might not adequately assess response to the chronic stress of critical illness.|$|E
25|$|In the environment, {{bacteria}} preferentially produce 5α-cholestan-3β-ol (5α-cholestanol) from cholesterol {{rather than}} the 5β isomer. This reaction occurs principally in anaerobic reducing sediments and the 5α-cholestanol / cholesterol ratio {{may be used as}} a secondary (process) biomarker for such conditions. No <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> have been suggested for this marker and so it is used in a relative sense; the greater the ratio, the more reducing the environment. Reducing environments are frequently associated with areas experiencing high organic matter input; this may include sewage derived discharges. The relationship between reducing conditions and the potential source can be seen in a cross plot with a sewage indicator.|$|E

25|$|Economists Hendrik Wolff, Howard Chong and Maximilian Auffhammer {{discuss the}} HDI from the {{perspective}} of data error in the underlying health, education and income statistics used to construct the HDI.

The authors suggest that the United Nations should discontinue the practice of classifying countries into development bins because: the <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> seem arbitrary, can provide incentives for strategic behavior in reporting official statistics, and have the potential to misguide politicians, investors, charity donors and the public who use the HDI at large.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, as {{the inaugural}} effort, the theme was simply ‘Awareness of high blood {{pressure}}’. The 2006 theme was ‘Treat to goal’, {{with a focus}} on keeping blood pressure under control. The recommended blood pressures are less than 140/90 mmHg for the general population and for the hypertensive population without any other complications, and less than 130/80 mmHg for those with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. These are the <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> recommended by international and Canadian guidelines. The 2007 WHD theme was ‘Healthy diet, healthy blood pressure’. Through such specific themes, the WHL intends to raise awareness not only of hypertension, but also of factors contributing to an increase in the incidence of hypertension and on ways to prevent it. In an effort to empower the public, the theme for 2008 was ‘Measure your blood pressure…at home’. Recent reports confirm the ease, accuracy and safety of blood pressure measurements using home monitors.|$|E

40|$|Objective. In the {{traditional}} oriental medicine, {{it is sometimes}} difficult to diagnose Blood Stasis Syndrome (BSS) in patients, because the diagnosis of BSS {{is based on the}} subjective signs and symptoms of patients. This study is aimed at developing the prediction tool of BSS using <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> for BSS score. The identification of a <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> for BSS score to diagnose BSS would be helpful. Methods. A total of 887 patients admitted to six traditional Korean medical hospitals in 2013 and three hospitals in 2014. All patients have an identical pattern as a result of diagnostic decision of two experts. The <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> for BSS score for BSS diagnosis was determined by the receiver-operating characteristic curve. Results. The area under the curve of this curve was 0. 897. The optimal cut-off point for detection of BSS was 49. 0. The sensitivity and specificity of this <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> were 80. 8 % and 83. 2 % in modelling data (2013 dataset) and 84. 6 % and 83. 1 % in validation data (2014 dataset), respectively. Conclusion. Our study suggests that a BSS score <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> of 49. 0 can be used to detect BSS in {{the traditional}} Korean medical hospitals. This <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> for diagnosis of BSS will make up the lack of objectivity...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} predict if the {{inflammatory}} cytokines (IL- 1 α, IL- 1 β, and IL- 10) were beneficial as biomarkers in early screening for T 1 DM and in monitoring immunological treatment, diagnostic reliability {{was determined to}} select the best <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> within the patient group (calculated from the control group). Our data revealed that IL 10 was the best to discriminate T 1 DM with <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> of 5.95  pg/ml and, at this value, the sensitivity was 96 % and specificity was 90 %. The next most useful test was IL- 1 α and its <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> of 0.615  pg/ml at which the sensitivity was 87 % and specificity was 80 %.

2500|$|Other {{conditions}} {{may also be}} misdiagnosed as carpal tunnel syndrome. Thus, if history and physical examination suggest CTS, patients will sometimes be tested electrodiagnostically with nerve conduction studies and electromyography. The role of confirmatory nerve conduction studies is controversial. [...] The goal of electrodiagnostic testing is to compare the speed of conduction in the median nerve with conduction in other nerves supplying the hand. [...] When the median nerve is compressed, as in CTS, it will conduct more slowly than normal and more slowly than other nerves. [...] There are many electrodiagnostic tests {{used to make a}} diagnosis of CTS, but the most sensitive, specific, and reliable test is the Combined Sensory Index (also known as the Robinson index). [...] Electrodiagnosis rests upon demonstrating impaired median nerve conduction across the carpal tunnel in context of normal conduction elsewhere. Compression results in damage to the myelin sheath and manifests as delayed latencies and slowed conduction velocities [...] However, normal electrodiagnostic studies do not preclude the presence of carpal tunnel syndrome, as a threshold of nerve injury must be reached before study results become abnormal and <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> for abnormality are variable. [...] Carpal tunnel syndrome with normal electrodiagnostic tests is very, very mild at worst.|$|E

50|$|One {{study used}} the water {{advancing}} contact angle {{to estimate the}} wettability of fifty five oil reservoirs. Deoxygenated synthetic formation brine and dead anaerobic crudes were tested on quartz and calcite crystals at reservoir temperature. Contact angles from 0 to 75 degrees were deemed water wet, 75 to 105 degrees as intermediate and 105 to 180 degrees as oil wet. Although the range of wettabilities was divided into three regions, these are arbitrary divisions. The wettability of different reservoirs can vary within the broad spectrum from strongly-water wet to strongly-oil wet. Another study described two initial conditions as reference and non-reference for calculating <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> by using advancing and receding contact angles and spontaneous imbibition data. Limiting value between water wet and intermediate zones was described as 62 degree. Similarly, <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> for advancing contact angle is described as 0 to 62 degrees for water wet region, 62 to 133 degrees for Intermediate-wet zone, and 133 to 180 degrees for Oil wet zone.Chilingar and Yen examined extensive research work on 161 limestone, dolomitic limestone, calcitic dolomite, and dolomite cores. <b>Cut-off</b> <b>values</b> classified as 160 to 180 degrees for strongly oil wet, 100 to 160 degrees for oil wet, 80 to 100 degrees intermediate wet, 80 to 20 degrees water wet and 0 to 20 strongly water wet.|$|E

40|$|Objective　To {{explore the}} {{potential}} influence of gender on screening value of aldosterone-renin ratio (ARR) for primary aldosteronism (PA). Methods　The biochemical parameters were collected of 451 PA patients and 300 essential hypertension (EH) {{patients who were}} diagnosed in the General Hospital of PLA from 1992 to 2014. Each group was then {{divided into two groups}} by gender. The clinical characteristics were compared and then the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was conducted to evaluate the best <b>cut-off</b> <b>value.</b> Results　The plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC), serum sodium and ARR were much higher, but the plasma rennin activity (PRA), serum potassium and BMI were much lower in PA patients than in EH patients (P 0. 05). The best <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> of ARR in male PA patients was 19. 11, the relevant area under the curve (AUC) was 0. 968, the sensitivity and specificity was 92. 44 % and 93. 08 %, and the Youden index (YI) was 0. 86. The best <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> of ARR in female PA patients was 27. 26, with AUC 0. 956, sensitivity 92. 07 %, specificity 90. 00 % and YI 0. 82, respectively. If the <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> was set at 27. 26 in males, the specificity would rise a little, but the sensitivity and YI would sharply decrease. Similarly, the sensitivity would increase a little but the specificity and YI would fall substantially if the <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> in females was set at 19. 11. The best <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> of ARR in men was smaller than the official value recommended by guidelines. Conclusion　Gender is an important factor should be considered while ARR is used in PA screening, and the <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> of ARR in screening female PA patients should be setting higher.

40|$|Background D-dimer {{testing to}} rule out deep vein {{thrombosis}} is less useful in older patients because of a lower specificity. An age-adjusted D-dimer <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> increased the proportion of older patients (> 50 years) in whom pulmonary embolism could be excluded. We retrospectively validated the efficacy of this cut-off combined with clinical probability for the exclusion of deep vein thrombosis. Design and Methods Five management study cohorts of 2818 consecutive outpatients with suspected deep vein thrombosis were used. Patients with non-high or unlikely probability of deep vein thrombosis {{were included in the}} analysis; four different D-dimer tests were used. The proportion of patients with a normal D-dimer test and the failure rates were calculated using the conventional (500 mg/L) and the age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off (patient's age x 10 mg/L in patients > 50 years). Results In 1672 patients with non-high probability, deep vein thrombosis could be excluded in 850 (51 %) patients with the age-adjusted <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> versus 707 (42 %) patients with the conventional <b>cut-off</b> <b>value.</b> The failure rates were 7 (0. 8; 95 % confidence interval 0. 3 - 1. 7 %) for the age-adjusted <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> and 5 (0. 7 %, 0. 2 - 1. 6 %) for the conventional <b>cut-off</b> <b>value.</b> The absolute increase in patients in whom deep vein thrombosis could be ruled out using the age-adjusted <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> was largest in patients > 70 years: 19 % among patients with non-high probability.

40|$|There {{are several}} {{criteria}} for {{determination of the}} most appropriate <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> in a diagnostic test with continuous results.
