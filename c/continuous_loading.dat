40|$|The {{increase}} in <b>continuous</b> <b>loads</b> such as radio transmitters and microprocessors in substations {{has led some}} utilities, including ours, {{to take a closer}} look at the sizing of the stationary batteries that operate those stations when commercial power is lost. Critical functions, such as tripping circuit breakers and conununicating information to dispatch centers, are placed on DC power. When station power is present, that DC power for the <b>continuous</b> <b>loads</b> is supplied by the charger. When conunercial power is lost, however, the <b>continuous</b> <b>loads</b> are carried by the batteries, which must also have the capacity to operate tripping mechanisms. IEEE Standard 485 I is widely accepted as the guideline for sizing of stationary batteries, and its application is discussed. Once a battery is placed in service, its maintenance, monitoring and periodic testing protocols are the next issues that the utility considers. Those practiced by this utility are discussed, including monitoring of the presence of DC power at certain critical points by SCADA equipment. The COIIlIOOnvoltages in electric utility substations are 48 and 120. 48 volt systems are more common, and are the preferred choice when allowable because of their smaller physical size and ease of maintenance. In some stations, however, the physical size of the station requires the higher voltage in order to lower the current and thus the voltage drop. Changes in equipment over the last twenty years have caused an {{increase in}} the <b>continuous</b> <b>loads</b> placed on substation batteries.
