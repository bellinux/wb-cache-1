60|$|You are {{perfectly}} well aware, I have no doubt, that the Athenaeum was projected {{at a time}} when commerce was in a vigorous and flourishing condition, and when those classes of society to which it particularly addresses itself were fully employed, and in the receipt of regular incomes. A season of depression almost without a parallel ensued, and large numbers of young men employed in warehouses and offices suddenly found their occupation gone, and themselves reduced to very straitened and penurious circumstances. This altered state of things led, as I am told, to the <b>compulsory</b> <b>withdrawal</b> of many of the members, to a proportionate decrease in the expected funds, and to the incurrence of a debt of 3,000 pounds. By the very great zeal and energy of all concerned, and by the liberality of those to whom they applied for help, that debt is now in rapid course of being discharged. A little more of the same indefatigable exertion on the one hand, and a little more of the same community of feeling upon the other, {{and there will be no}} such thing; the figures will be blotted out for good and all, and, from that time, the Athenaeum may be said to belong to you, and to your heirs for ever.|$|E

Young Officers (YO) (officers in training) at the Britannia Royal Naval College or Commando Training Centre Royal Marines and Officer Candidates promoted from the Lower Deck who fail to complete initial training can also be subjected to a CWFT. Pilots undergoing professional training would be suspended from flying duties.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} the introduction of an academic dismissal (AD) policy (i. e. an intervention which can lead to <b>compulsory</b> student <b>withdrawal)</b> on student dropout, student graduation rates and satisfaction with the study program. Using a Difference-in-Differences type of estimator, we compare programs that introduced an AD policy with a control group of programs which did not employ an AD policy. The robustness of the results is tested by a propensity score matching. The outcomes suggest that the implementation of an academic dismissal policy results in a higher first year dropout rate, and a higher student graduation rate. The results also indicate that, on average, student satisfaction decreases due to the introduction of an AD policy, while student satisfaction regarding program feasibility increases when an AD policy is employed. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Gender {{issues are}} {{a focus of}} {{discussion}} in present day research in Kerala. A state with high level human development Index and Gender development index shows economic political and social invisibility of females received attention in Kerala’s academic circles. Majority of the studies highlighted male dominance {{as a reason for}} the present day female deprivation. But the special characteristic of reproductive role of female has not received much attention. The rights of women and children are intertwined during the infant stages of life and the health of children is intimately connected with the conditions in which their mothers work. The first six years of life (and especially the first two years) have a decisive and lasting influence on a child’s health, well-being, aptitudes and opportunities. The absent from market work for a long period during their younger ages (potential age), reduces the experience and competitiveness of mother. The full time mental and physical presence of mother during the child’s early six years is the right of the child because; any deficiency of food or mental care will negatively influence the entire future achievement of the child. The <b>compulsory</b> <b>withdrawal,</b> from market work reduces the efficiency of women in labour market and thereby reduces her earning capacity, in future reduces the material well being of the child in his/her future development. Present paper discusses about the contradictions of child’s right and mothers rights and link the role of society in it. This paper is basically a theoretical one. ...|$|E
