50|$|The Maqlû, “burning,” {{series is}} an Akkadian incantation text which <b>concerns</b> <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> of a rather lengthy anti-witchcraft, or kišpū, ritual. In its mature form, {{probably}} composed {{in the early}} first millennium BC, it comprises eight tablets of nearly a hundred incantations and a ritual tablet, giving incipits and directions for the ceremony. This was performed {{over the course of}} a single night in the month of Abu (July/August) when the perambulations of the spirits to and from the netherworld made them especially vulnerable to its spells. It was the subject of a letter from the exorcist Nabû-nādin-šumi and the Assyrian king Esarhaddon. It seems to have evolved from an earlier short-form with only ten incantations to be performed in a morning ceremony, whose first incantation begins: Šamaš annûtu șalmū ēpišiya (“O Shamash, these are the figurines of my sorcerer”).|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This {{correspondence}} <b>concerns</b> <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> {{analysis of}} turbo-single-parity-check (SPC) codes {{based on the}} union bound of bit-error rate (BER). A treatment of the special interleavers used in turbo-SPC codes is discussed. It is shown that simple two- or four-state turbo-SPC codes with multiple component codes can perform comparably as (or even better than) the 16 -state standard turbo codes. Using more complex trellis codes (with state number more than 4) appears unnecessary for such codes. Instead, performance improvement {{can be achieved by}} increasing the number of component codes, which maintains the low decoding complexity property of turbo-SPC codes. Index Terms—Free distance, parallel concatenated codes, single-parity-check (SPC) codes, turbo codes, union bound. I...|$|E

Several aspects are investigated, concerned mainly with the serviceability limit state.

The packet arrival process is described by a Markov chain with finite state space. We derive the stationary expected number of packets in the buffer and the stationary expected packet delay. We also formulate and describe the implementation of an algorithm to compute these quantities. The accuracy of the algorithm is checked by simulation.

40|$|This paper <b>concerns</b> <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> of {{the class}} of signal {{subspace}} fitting algorithms for signal parameter estimation using narrowband sensor array data. The principal sources of estimation error in such applica-tions are the finite sample effects of additive noise and imprecise models for the antenna array and spatial noise statistics. The covariance matrix of the estima-tion error when all of these error sources are present is found to be the sum of the individual contributions from each component separately. This simplifying fact allows for the derivation of an overall optimal subspace weighting for a particular array and noise covariance error model. In fact, the resulting algorithm yields the lowest possible asymptotic estimation error variance of any method for the model in question. ...|$|E
