5|$|Natasha {{models for}} a PirateNet {{advertising}} campaign, where she meets Andrew Robinson and Summer Hoyland. Natasha gets {{into trouble with}} her father, Michael (Sandy Winton), after he finds out she lied by saying she was eighteen on the <b>consent</b> <b>form.</b> He threatens to sue the station owner and Andrew's father, Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis). Natasha and Andrew work together to change the posters, so {{they are no longer}} revealing. They then attend a concert together and kiss {{at the end of the}} night. Natasha clashes with Summer and starts a rumour that her boyfriend, Chris Pappas (James Mason), bought the basketball team captaincy. Her relationship with her father is strained further when he learns she started the rumour. The schools English teacher, Libby Kennedy (Kym Valentine), discovers Natasha is hiding her maths skills and makes her join the Mathletes as a punishment. Natasha wonders if Andrew is only with her because of her looks and she becomes insecure about their relationship.|$|E
5|$|The {{new group}} of drugs was {{initially}} greeted with optimism by the medical profession, but gradually concerns arose; in particular, the risk of dependence became evident in the 1980s. Benzodiazepines have a unique history in that they {{were responsible for the}} largest-ever class-action lawsuit against drug manufacturers in the United Kingdom, involving 14,000 patients and 1,800 law firms that alleged the manufacturers knew of the dependence potential but intentionally withheld this information from doctors. At the same time, 117 general practitioners and 50 health authorities were sued by patients to recover damages for the harmful effects of dependence and withdrawal. This led some doctors to require a signed <b>consent</b> <b>form</b> from their patients and to recommend that all patients be adequately warned of the risks of dependence and withdrawal before starting treatment with benzodiazepines. The court case against the drug manufacturers never reached a verdict; legal aid had been withdrawn and there were allegations that the consultant psychiatrists, the expert witnesses, had a conflict of interest. This litigation led to changes in the British law, making class action lawsuits more difficult.|$|E

40|$|Background. The {{present study}} aimed to screen the {{knowledge}} and attitudes of dentists toward the use of informed <b>consent</b> <b>forms</b> prior to procedures involving operative dentistry. Methods. A research tool containing questions (questionnaire) {{regarding the use of}} informed <b>consent</b> <b>forms</b> was developed. The questionnaire consisted of seven questions structured to screen the current practice in operative dentistry towards the use of informed <b>consent</b> <b>forms.</b> Results. The questionnaires were distributed among 731 dentists, of which 179 returned them with answers. Sixty-seven dentists reported not using informed <b>consent</b> <b>forms.</b> The main reasons for not using informed <b>consent</b> <b>forms</b> were: having a complete dental record signed by the patient (67. 2 %) and having a good relation with patients (43. 6 %). The dentists who reported using informed <b>consent</b> <b>forms</b> revealed that they obtained them from other dentists and made their own modifications (35. 9 %). Few dentists revealed contacting lawyers (1. 7 %) and experts in legal dentistry (0. 9 %) for the development of their informed <b>consent</b> <b>forms.</b> Conclusion. A high number of dentists working in the field of operative dentistry behave according to the ethical standards in the clinical practice, becoming unprotected against ethical and legal actions...|$|R
40|$|Background: Informed <b>consent</b> <b>forms</b> are {{required}} in all clinical trials which are approved {{by an independent}} Ethics Committee before practical use in the trials. However, how much the average subject actually understands of {{the information contained in}} these informed <b>consent</b> <b>forms</b> is uncertain. Aim: In a cross sectional study, the translated informed <b>consent</b> <b>forms</b> used in psychiatric clinical trials were assessed with respect to their ease of readability. Materials and Methods: We analyzed 30 informed <b>consent</b> <b>forms</b> translated from English to Hindi used in multinational and multicentre psychiatric clinical trials sponsored by different sponsors. We examined <b>consent</b> <b>forms</b> for readability scores and factors that might relate to readability. Results: The mean readability score for the informed <b>consent</b> <b>forms,</b> determined by the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Index (FKGL) was grade levels of 13. 66. The ease of readability assessed by the Flesch Reading Ease Score (FRES) was 46. 08 suggesting significant complexity of the texts. These values carry even more significance when the average years of schooling for India as a whole are 6. 2 years. Conclusion: Our results show that the most informed <b>consent</b> <b>forms</b> were too complex to understand by an average adult subject. We suggest reducing this complexity and increasing the ease of readability so those average subjects receive the intended information as exactly as it could be. This can be achieved by few simple measures like improving the deficiencies in translation processes, encouraging the investigators to participate while preparing these forms, and enhanced understanding of the site specific requirements, namely culture, language (dialect), general literacy rate, etc...|$|R

Women taking isotretinoin must not get pregnant during and for 1 month after the discontinuation of isotretinoin therapy. Sexual abstinence or effective contraception is mandatory during this period. Barrier methods by themselves (e.g., condoms) are not considered adequate due to the unacceptable failure rates of approximately 3%. Women who fall pregnant whilst on isotretinoin therapy are generally counselled to have a termination. Isotretinoin {{has no effect on}} male fertility.|$|E
25|$|Prior to surgery, {{the patient}} is given a medical examination, {{receives}} certain pre-operative tests, and their physical status is rated according to the ASA physical status classification system. If these results are satisfactory, the patient signs a <b>consent</b> <b>form</b> and is given a surgical clearance. If the procedure is expected to result in significant blood loss, an autologous blood donation may be made some weeks prior to surgery. If the surgery involves the digestive system, the patient may be instructed to perform a bowel prep by drinking a solution of polyethylene glycol {{the night before the}} procedure. Patients are also instructed to abstain from food or drink (an NPO order after midnight on the night before the procedure), to minimize the effect of stomach contents on pre-operative medications and reduce the risk of aspiration if the patient vomits during or after the procedure.|$|E

25|$|Tattooing is {{regulated}} {{in many countries}} because of the associated health risks to client and practitioner, specifically local infections and virus transmission. Disposable plastic aprons and eye protection can be worn depending on the risk of blood or other secretions splashing into the eyes or clothing of the tattoist. Hand hygiene, assessment of risks and appropriate disposal of all sharp objects and materials contaminated with blood are crucial areas. The tattoo artist must wash his or her hands and must also wash the area that will be tattooed. Gloves must be worn at all times and the wound must be wiped frequently with a wet disposable towel of some kind. All equipment must be sterilized in a certified autoclave before and after every use. It is good practice to provide clients with a printed <b>consent</b> <b>form</b> that outlines risks and complications as well as instructions for after care.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, while filming for the show, the CBSA {{conducted}} {{a raid on}} a construction site in Vancouver. They arrested a Mexican national, Oscar Mata Duran, and brought him to an immigration detention centre where he was presented with a filming <b>consent</b> <b>form.</b> Canada's Privacy Commissioner, following a complaint from the man, investigated. The Commissioner found that the CBSA breached Canada's Privacy Act by filming their interaction with Duran before he was advised {{of the purposes of}} filming and found that the coercive nature of being detained in a holding facility would have prevented Duran from providing informed consent for his appearance. The Commissioner lauded Duran as a real hero for lodging the privacy complaint even though he would not personally benefit from it. Duran was deported following the raid. In light of Duran's complaint the Privacy Commissioner recommended that the CBSA end its participation in the show, the CBSA announced that the show would not return for a fourth season.|$|E
25|$|At the Fatal Accident Inquiry held in Banff in February 1972 Adam Watson was {{the chief}} expert witness for the Crown. It emerged that the <b>consent</b> <b>form</b> issued to parents {{did not say that}} winter {{mountaineering}} was involved. Also, only one of the parents had been told the outing was going to be to the Cairngorms. The Inquiry reported that the deaths had been due to cold and exposure. It recommended (1) there should be special regard for fitness and training, (2) parents should be given fuller information about outdoor activities, (3) parties should be led by fully qualified instructors and accompanied by certified teachers, (4) suitable locations for summer and winter expeditions should be identified in consultation with mountaineering organisations, (5) experts should advise on whether high-level shelters should be removed, (6) the mountain rescue teams were praised and consideration should be given to supporting the teams financially and generally, (7) following any future disaster there should be closer liaison between authorities and parents. The jury did not want to discourage future adventurous outdoor activities. The advocate for the parents suggested that the overall leader of the expedition and the principal of Lagganlia should be found at fault but the Inquiry did not make any finding of fault.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Research {{ethics and}} the {{measures}} deployed to ensure ethical oversight of research (e. g., informed <b>consent</b> <b>forms,</b> ethics review) are vested with extremely important ethical and practical goals. Accordingly, these measures need to function effectively in real-world research and to follow high level standards. Methods We examined approved <b>consent</b> <b>forms</b> for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies approved by Canadian research ethics boards (REBs). Results We {{found evidence of}} variability in <b>consent</b> <b>forms</b> in matters of physical and psychological risk reporting. Approaches used to tackle the emerging issue of incidental findings exposed extensive variability between and within research sites. Conclusion The causes of variability in approved <b>consent</b> <b>forms</b> and studies need to be better understood. However, mounting evidence of administrative and practical hurdles within current ethics governance systems combined with potential sub-optimal provision of information to and protection of research subjects support other calls for more scrutiny of research ethics practices and applicable revisions. </p...|$|R

METHODS: We assessed the readability of 73 informed <b>consent</b> <b>forms</b> of research protocols conducted in the clinical investigation centres in the Rhone-Alpes area, and then compared them with 33 reference texts corresponding to 5 French school grades (first year infant, primary school, GCS level, high school, and classics aggregation), using the Flesch test and Cordial" analyser. RESULTS: Median Flesch scores were 66 for the first year infant level, 62 for the primary school level, 58 for the GCS level, 42 for the high school level, and 43 for the aggregation level. It was 22 for the informed <b>consent</b> <b>forms.</b> Median Cordial scores were 86 for the first year infant level, 77 for the second, 74 for the third, 49 for the fourth, 43 for the fifth.
