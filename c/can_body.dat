50|$|A {{double seam}} is the closure between a <b>can</b> <b>body</b> {{and a can}} end (or lid).|$|E
50|$|The {{body and}} end are brought {{together}} in a seamer and {{held in place by}} the base plate and chuck, respectively. The base plate provides a sure footing for the <b>can</b> <b>body</b> during the seaming operation and the chuck fits snugly into the end (lid). The result is the countersink of the end sits inside the top of the <b>can</b> <b>body</b> just below the flange. The end curl protrudes slightly beyond the flange.|$|E
5000|$|On the press, four (up to six) {{different}} ink rollers {{supply the}} colors that will coat the individual printer plates. Printer plates contact a rubberized blanket on a rotating wheel, {{resulting in a}} complete negative color image on the blanket. Clean cans are fed into the printer and are placed on a steel mandrel. The spinning mandrel then rotates the <b>can</b> <b>body</b> against the rotating blanket, resulting in {{the transfer of the}} final graphic image onto the <b>can</b> <b>body.</b> Other coatings are applied after the ink, and then are sent to the UV ovens.|$|E

50|$|The U.S. Army's flat ovoid M-1932 wartime-issue mess kit {{was made}} of {{galvanized}} steel (stainless steel in the later M-1942), and was a divided pan-and-body system. When opened, the mess kit consisted of two halves: the deeper half forms a shallow, flat-bottom, ovoid Meat <b>Can</b> <b>Body,</b> designed to receive the Meat Ration, the meat portion of the prewar canned Reserve Ration. The Meat <b>Can</b> <b>Body,</b> with its folding handle extended, can double as a crude skillet. The Mess Kit Plate (lid) is even more shallow, and is pressed to form two compartments, with a center divide wide enough to accommodate the folding handle. The plate also has a very secure ring that is {{held in place by}} friction.|$|E
50|$|A {{can seamer}} is a machine used {{to seal the}} lid to the <b>can</b> <b>body.</b> The lid or ' 'end' ' is usually tinplated steel while the body can be of metal (such as cans for {{beverages}} and soups), paperboard (whisky cans) or plastic.|$|E

5000|$|Originally, the can end was {{soldered}} or welded {{onto the}} <b>can</b> <b>body</b> after the can was filled. [...] However, this introduced {{a variety of}} issues, such as foreign contaminants (including lead and other harmful heavy metals). The double seam was later developed as a cheaper and safer alternative and quickly replaced the welded seam.|$|E
50|$|Double seaming uses rollers {{to shape}} the can, lid and the final double seam. To make a {{sanitary}} can and lid suitable for double seaming, manufacture begins with a sheet of coated tin plate. To create the <b>can</b> <b>body,</b> rectangles are cut and curled around a die, and welded together creating a cylinder with a side seam.|$|E
5000|$|Before any {{graphics}} {{can be put}} on the can product, disks are cut in {{aluminium sheet}} stock and are formed to make the <b>can</b> <b>body</b> and shape. Before it reaches the printer, the can is washed, trimmed and dried thoroughly before an over varnish or ink is applied. Special coating for inside the can is also applied here.|$|E

50|$|When stored, the Mess Kit Plate {{is placed}} {{on top of the}} ovoid Meat <b>Can</b> <b>Body,</b> while the stamped folding handle is folded over the inverse side of the plate's center divider, and latched onto the edge of the Body. It is further secured folding the lid's ring {{toward the center of the}} mess kit, which locks onto another latch. In use, each piece may be used individually, or as a unitary three-compartment mess tray, {{accomplished}} by sliding the lid-plate's center divider onto the folding handle, and securing it to the handle by the ring-and-latch mechanisms. When latched, the kit can be held in a ready position by the user in one hand to receive U.S. Army's 'A' or 'B' field kitchen rations. As the soldier passed along the mess line, food service personnel would dole out hot items first, often meat followed by vegetables, potatoes and other side dishes, ostensibly separated by the tray dividers. Dessert was piled in the center of the accumulated portions — if the soldier was lucky. While a soldier could use the handled Meat <b>Can</b> <b>Body</b> from his kit to cook raw food, it is really too shallow and thin to serve as an effective skillet, and was usually restricted to heating the canned Meat Ration. After 1938, the Meat <b>Can</b> <b>Body</b> was used to heat the meat and vegetable component of the C-ration, or to reconstitute breakfast items such as C-ration powdered eggs.|$|E
5000|$|When {{entering}} the water, swimmers can use techniques {{to take advantage}} of the shallow water. One such technique is walking along the bottom. Another technique is [...] "dolphining", which involves diving down to the bottom and launching oneself upwards and forwards. This technique can also help to avoid incoming waves. When exiting the water, swimmers <b>can</b> <b>body</b> surf {{to take advantage of}} waves.|$|E
50|$|A {{circle is}} then {{cut from the}} sheet using a die cutter. The circle is shaped in a {{stamping}} press to create a downward countersink to fit snugly into the <b>can</b> <b>body.</b> The result {{can be compared to}} an upside down and very flat top hat. The outer edge is then curled down and around about 140 degrees using rollers to create the end curl.|$|E

5000|$|The {{double seam}} is made using a double seamer, which can {{have just one}} or a number of heads or seaming stations. The double seam is formed by {{mechanically}} interlocking five layers of material together: three layers of the can end and two layers of the <b>can</b> <b>body.</b> Each seaming head typically consists of two rolls, a first operation roll and second operation roll, and a chuck. Some seaming machines have two first operation rolls and two second operation rolls and a few machines use a method called [...] "rail seaming" [...] which requires no rolls. During the seaming operation, the can end is lowered on to the filled <b>can</b> <b>body</b> and held down by the chuck, which acts as an anvil to the seaming operation. The first operation roll then engages the can end against the <b>can</b> <b>body</b> thereby folding the end curl around the flange of the body. In some seaming machines, this is done as the can is turning at high speed. In other seaming machines, the can is stationary and the first operation roll (or rolls) spins around several times to ensure a complete first operation. After the first operation is complete, the first operation roll disengages from the can and the second operation roll then engages the can. The purpose of the second operation is to iron out the double seam into its final shape and remove the voids between the layers of can and end material. In practice, ironing {{out all of the}} can and end material in a double seam without leaving some voids is impossible without the use of a sealing compound.|$|E
50|$|Probably {{the most}} {{important}} innovation since the introduction of double seams is the welded side seam. Prior to the welded side seam, the <b>can</b> <b>body</b> was folded and/or soldered together, leaving a relatively thick side seam. The thick side seam required that the side seam end juncture at the end curl to have more metal to curl around before closing in behind the Body Hook or flange, with a greater opportunity for error.|$|E
50|$|To {{complement}} the mess kit, soldiers used a stamped cup especially molded to fit over {{the bottom of}} the U.S. Army's standard one-quart (950 ml) canteen. This cup {{could be used as a}} boiling vessel, when boiling water for coffee, or for heating or reconstituting soup and other foods. During World War II, units preparing heated combat rations in the Meat <b>Can</b> <b>Body</b> or canteen cup mainly used locally procured combustible materials or Sterno fuel units of jellied alcohol. The latter could be stored within an issued folding stove for deployment when heating food, soup, or coffee in the field.|$|E

50|$|Cans {{are filled}} before {{the top is}} crimped on. The filling and sealing {{operations}} need to be extremely fast and precise. The filling head centers the can using gas pressure, purges the air, and lets the beverage flow {{down the sides of}} the can. The lid is placed on the can, and then crimped in two operations. A seaming head engages the lid from above while a seaming roller to the side curls the edge of the lid {{around the edge of the}} <b>can</b> <b>body.</b> The head and roller spin the can in a complete circle to seal all the way around. Then a pressure roller with a different profile drives the two edges together under pressure to make a gas-tight seal. Filled cans usually have pressurized gas inside, which makes them stiff enough for easy handling.|$|E
