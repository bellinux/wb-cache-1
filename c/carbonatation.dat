5|$|The sugar may {{be transported}} in bulk {{to the country}} {{where it will be}} used and the {{refining}} process often takes place there. The first stage is known as affination and involves immersing the sugar crystals in a concentrated syrup that softens and removes the sticky brown coating without dissolving them. The crystals are then separated from the liquor and dissolved in water. The resulting syrup is treated either by a <b>carbonatation</b> or by a phosphatation process. Both involve the precipitation of a fine solid in the syrup and when this is filtered out, many of the impurities are removed at the same time. Removal of color is achieved by using either a granular activated carbon or an ion-exchange resin. The sugar syrup is concentrated by boiling and then cooled and seeded with sugar crystals, causing the sugar to crystallize out. The liquor is spun off in a centrifuge and the white crystals are dried in hot air and ready to be packaged or used. The surplus liquor is made into refiners' molasses.|$|E
25|$|An {{indispensable}} {{component of}} this process is the <b>carbonatation</b> of the lime, which fixes the colour in the plaster ensuring durability of the fresco for future generations.|$|E
25|$|Blanco directo, a {{white sugar}} common in India and other south Asian countries, is {{produced}} by precipitating many impurities out of cane juice using phosphoric acid and calcium hydroxide, similar to the <b>carbonatation</b> technique used in beet sugar refining. Blanco directo is more pure than mill white sugar, but less pure than white refined.|$|E
25|$|As {{a rule of}} thumb, only to give an idea {{on orders}} of magnitude, steel is {{protected}} at pH above ~11 but starts to corrode below ~10 depending on steel characteristics and local physico-chemical conditions when concrete becomes carbonated. <b>carbonatation</b> of concrete along with chloride ingress are amongst the chief reasons {{for the failure of}} reinforcement bars in concrete.|$|E
25|$|It is {{also used}} as a raw {{material}} in the refining of sugar from sugar beet; It is calcined in a kiln with anthracite to produce calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. This burnt lime is then slaked in sweet water to produce a calcium hydroxide suspension for the precipitation of impurities in raw juice during <b>carbonatation.</b>|$|E
25|$|One {{method of}} testing a {{structure}} for <b>carbonatation</b> is to drill a fresh hole in the surface and then treat the cut surface with phenolphthalein indicator solution. This solution turns pink when in contact with alkaline concrete, {{making it possible to}} see the depth of carbonation. Using an existing hole does not suffice because the exposed surface will already be carbonated.|$|E
25|$|White refined is {{the most}} common form of sugar in North America and Europe. Refined sugar is made by {{dissolving}} and purifying raw sugar using phosphoric acid similar to the method used for blanco directo, a <b>carbonatation</b> process involving calcium hydroxide and carbon dioxide, or by various filtration strategies. It is then further purified by filtration through a bed of activated carbon or bone char. Beet sugar refineries produce refined white sugar directly without an intermediate raw stage.|$|E
25|$|Concrete can {{be damaged}} by many processes, {{such as the}} {{expansion}} of corrosion products of the steel reinforcement bars, freezing of trapped water, fire or radiant heat, aggregate expansion, sea water effects, bacterial corrosion, leaching, erosion by fast-flowing water, physical damage and chemical damage (from <b>carbonatation,</b> chlorides, sulfates and distillate water). The micro fungi Aspergillus Alternaria and Cladosporium 	were able to grow on samples of concrete used as a radioactive waste barrier in the Chernobyl reactor; leaching aluminium, iron, calcium and silicon.|$|E
500|$|Sugarcane {{refers to}} any of several species, or their hybrids, of giant grasses in the genus Saccharum [...] in the family Poaceae. They have been {{cultivated}} in tropical climates in South Asia and Southeast Asia since ancient times for the sucrose that is found in their stems. A great expansion in sugarcane production {{took place in the}} 18th century with the establishment of slave plantations in the Americas. The use of slavery meant that {{this was the first time}} that sugar became cheap enough for most people, who previously had to rely on honey to sweeten foods. It requires a frost-free climate with sufficient rainfall during the growing season to make full use of the plant's great growth potential. The crop is harvested mechanically or by hand, chopped into lengths and conveyed rapidly to the processing plant (commonly known as a sugar mill). Here, it is either milled and the juice extracted with water or extracted by diffusion. The juice is then clarified with lime and heated to destroy enzymes. The resulting thin syrup is concentrated in a series of evaporators, after which further water is removed by evaporation in vacuum containers. The resulting supersaturated solution is seeded with sugar crystals and the sugar crystallizes out and is separated from the fluid and dried. Molasses is a by-product of the process and the fiber from the stems, known as bagasse, is burned to provide energy for the sugar extraction process. The crystals of raw sugar have a sticky brown coating and either can be used as they are or can be bleached by sulfur dioxide or can be treated in a <b>carbonatation</b> process to produce a whiter product. [...] About [...] of irrigation water is needed for every one kilogram of sugar produced.|$|E
2500|$|Beet sugar {{producers}} {{slice the}} washed beets, then extract the sugar {{with hot water}} in a [...] "diffuser". An alkaline solution ("milk of lime" [...] and carbon dioxide from the lime kiln) then serves to precipitate impurities (see <b>carbonatation).</b> After filtration, evaporation concentrates the juice to a content of about 70% solids, and controlled crystallisation extracts the sugar. A centrifuge removes the sugar crystals from the liquid, which gets recycled in the crystalliser stages. When economic constraints prevent the removal of more sugar, the manufacturer discards the remaining liquid, now known as molasses, or sells it on to producers of animal feed.|$|E
50|$|Both DDS and RT {{processes}} are favoured by European factories. The <b>carbonatation</b> system is generally matched to the diffusion scheme; juice from RT diffusers being processed by the RT <b>carbonatation.</b>|$|E

50|$|Carbon dioxide {{from air}} can react with the calcium {{hydroxide}} in concrete to form calcium carbonate. This process is called <b>carbonatation,</b> {{which is essentially}} the reversal of the chemical process of calcination of lime taking place in a cement kiln. <b>Carbonatation</b> of concrete is a slow and continuous process progressing from the outer surface inward, but slows down with increasing diffusion depth.|$|E

5000|$|In civil engineering, to {{determine}} the <b>carbonatation</b> spread in concrete structures and therefore assess {{the state of the}} rebar's passivation film.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carbonatation</b> has two effects: it {{increases}} mechanical strength of concrete, {{but it also}} decreases alkalinity, which is essential for corrosion prevention of the reinforcement steel. Below a pH of 10, the steel's thin layer of surface passivation dissolves and corrosion is promoted. For the latter reason, <b>carbonatation</b> is an unwanted process in concrete chemistry. It can be tested by applying phenolphthalein solution, a pH indicator, over a fresh fracture surface, which indicates non-carbonatated and thus alkaline areas with a violet color.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carbonatation</b> is a {{slow process}} that occurs in {{concrete}} where lime (calcium hydroxide) in the cement reacts with carbon dioxide from the air and forms calcium carbonate.|$|E
50|$|The above {{chemical}} properties {{are commonly used}} for testing the presence of carbon dioxide in gaseous samples in school laboratories, and refining of sugar in a process called <b>carbonatation.</b>|$|E
50|$|This is {{a problem}} because {{the first line of}} defence of all {{structural}} elements against <b>carbonatation,</b> chlorides, frost and abrasion, is the cover zone. It is therefore imperative this region is durable.|$|E
50|$|The {{carbon dioxide}} in the air reacts with the alkali in the cement and makes the pore water more acidic, thus {{lowering}} the pH. Carbon dioxide will start to carbonatate the cement in the concrete from the moment the object is made. This <b>carbonatation</b> process will start at the surface, then slowly move deeper and deeper into the concrete. The rate of <b>carbonatation</b> is dependent on the relative humidity of the concrete - a 50% relative humidity being optimal. If the object is cracked, the {{carbon dioxide in}} the air will be better able to penetrate into the concrete.|$|E
50|$|After {{a number}} of hours the plaster reacts with the air in a process called <b>carbonatation.</b> This {{chemical}} reaction fixes the pigment particles at the plaster's surface in a protective crystalline mesh known as the lime crust.|$|E
5000|$|The {{clear juice}} from <b>carbonatation</b> is {{generally}} known as [...] "thin juice". it may undergo pH adjustment with soda ash and addition of sulfur ("sulfitation") {{prior to the}} next stage which is concentration by multiple effect evaporation.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} systems of <b>carbonatation,</b> named from the {{companies}} that first developed them. They differ in how the lime is introduced, the temperature and duration of each stage, and {{the separation of the}} solids from the liquid.|$|E
50|$|Concrete {{degradation}} {{may have}} various causes. Concrete can be damaged by fire, aggregate expansion, sea water effects, bacterial corrosion, calcium leaching, physical damage and chemical damage (from <b>carbonatation,</b> chlorides, sulfates and distilled water). This process adversely affects concrete exposed to these damaging stimuli.|$|E
50|$|The NRS-installation {{will consist}} {{of a number of}} columns filled with strong-acid-cationic resin. It is {{installed}} after <b>carbonatation</b> and filtration and before evaporation.The resin is loaded with sodium Na+ ions, that are exchanged for calcium Ca++. The softened juice will then be evaporated.|$|E
5000|$|Carbonates give a brisk {{effervescence}} with dilute H2SO4 due to {{the release}} of CO2, a colorless gas which turns limewater milky due to formation of CaCO3 (<b>carbonatation).</b> The milkiness disappears on passing an excess of the gas through the lime water, due to formation of Ca(HCO3)2.|$|E
50|$|Traditional non-hydraulic {{hydrated}} lime only sets through <b>carbonatation</b> when the plaster is kept moist and access of CO2 {{from the air}} is possible. It will not set when submersed in water. When a very thick layer or several layers are applied the lime can remain soft for weeks.|$|E
50|$|Up {{to about}} 300 °C, the {{concrete}} undergoes normal thermal expansion. Above that temperature, shrinkage occurs due to water loss; however, the aggregate continues expanding, which causes internal stresses. Up to about 500 °C, the major structural changes are <b>carbonatation</b> and coarsening of pores. At 573 °C, quartz undergoes rapid expansion due to phase transition, and at 900 °C calcite starts shrinking due to decomposition. At 450-550 °C the cement hydrate decomposes, yielding calcium oxide. Calcium carbonate decomposes at about 600 °C. Rehydration of the calcium oxide on cooling {{of the structure}} causes expansion, which can cause damage to material which withstood fire without falling apart. Concrete in buildings that experienced a fire and were left standing for several years shows extensive degree of <b>carbonatation</b> from carbon dioxide which is reabsorbed.|$|E

50|$|In 2013 {{permission}} {{was given}} {{for the construction of}} 175 houses in the Ganstead Road area of the estate. The site had been cleared of Boot house type (Henry Boot Construction) houses in the late 1990s, due to <b>carbonatation</b> problems in their concrete structures. Construction work by Keepmoat for Sanctuary Group/Hull City Council began on the first 54 houses at the site in December 2013.|$|E
5000|$|The {{premature}} failure of corroded steel reinforcements {{and the expansion}} of the iron corrosion products around the rebars are amongst the main causes of the concrete degradation. The carbon steel of rebars is protected from oxidation by atmospheric oxygen by the high pH of concrete interstitial water. Iron bar surface is passivated as long as the pH value is higher than 10.5. Fresh cement water has a pH of about 13.5 while evolved cement water pH ~ 12.5 is controlled by the dissolution of calcium hydroxide (portlandite). Carbon dioxide present in the air slowly diffuses through the concrete cover over the rebar and progressively reacts with the alkaline hydroxides (KOH, NaOH) and with calcium hydroxide leading to the <b>carbonatation</b> of the hydrated cement paste. As a result, the pH of the cement drops and when its value is below 10.5 - 9.5, steel surface is no longer passivated and starts to corrode. A sufficient thickness of concrete cover is thus required in order to slow down the <b>carbonatation</b> process towards the rebar. The minimum concrete cover will depend on the environmental conditions encountered and must be thicker when the concrete is also exposed to moisture and chloride (proximity to the sea, use of de-icing salt for bridges or roads, ...). A high quality concrete made with a low water-to-cement (w/c) ratio will have a lower porosity and will be less permeable to water and to the ingress of corrosive species (dissolved oxygen, chloride, ...). A thicker cover or a more compact concrete will also reduce the diffusion of CO2 in the concrete, protecting it better from <b>carbonatation</b> and maintaining a higher pH for a longer time period, increasing so the rebar service life.|$|E
