5000|$|There are {{a number}} of {{anaerobic}} organism that are involved in the process of anaerobic digestion including acetic acid-forming bacteria (acetogens) and methane-forming (methanogens). These organisms feed upon the initial feedstock, which undergoes a number of different processes converting it to intermediate molecules including sugars, hydrogen, and acetic acid, before finally being converted to biogas.Different species of bacteria are able to survive at different temperature ranges. Ones living optimally at temperatures between 35-40 °C are called mesophiles or mesophilic bacteria. Some of the bacteria can survive at the hotter and more hostile conditions of 55-60 °C, these are called thermophile.Methanogens come from the domain of archaea. This family includes species that can grow in the hostile conditions of hydrothermal vents. These species are more resistant to heat and can therefore operate at high temperatures, a property that is unique to thermophile.As with aerobic systems the bacteria in anaerobic systems the growing and reproducing microorganisms within them require a source of elemental oxygen to survive. In an anaerobic system there is an absence of gaseous oxygen. Gaseous oxygen is prevented from entering the system through physical containment in sealed tanks. Anaerobes access oxygen from sources other than the surrounding air. The oxygen source for these microorganisms can be the organic material itself or alternatively may be supplied by inorganic oxides from within the input material. When the oxygen source in an anaerobic system is derived from the organic material itself, then the 'intermediate' end products are primarily alcohols, aldehydes, and organic acids plus carbon dioxide. In the presence of specialised methanogens, the intermediates are converted to the 'final' end products of methane, carbon dioxide with trace levels of hydrogen sulfide.In an anaerobic system the majority of the chemical energy contained within the starting material is released by methanogenic bacteria as methane.Populations of anaerobic microorganisms typically take a significant period of time to establish themselves to be fully effective. It is therefore common practice to introduce anaerobic microorganisms from materials with existing populations, a process known as [...] "seeding" [...] the digesters, and typically takes place with the addition of sewage sludge or <b>cattle</b> <b>slurry.</b>|$|E
40|$|Fertiliser and manure {{application}} are important sources of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions from agricultural soils. The current default IPCC emission factor of 1. 0 % {{is independent of}} the type of fertiliser and manure, and application time, method and rate. However, in the IPCC Tiered system it is possible to use more specific emission factors that better reflect the actual fertiliser and manure management in a given country or region. The first and primary aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether the combination of <b>cattle</b> <b>slurry</b> injection with fertiliser application, which is common practice in intensively managed grasslands in the Netherlands and neighbouring countries, warrants an adjusted emission factor. A second aim was to evaluate whether alternative emission factors, based on N uptake and N surplus, respectively, give more insight in the N 2 O emission rates of various fertilisation strategies. In a 2 -year field experiment on sandy soil in the Netherlands we measured the annual N 2 O emission from grasslands receiving repeated simultaneous applications of fertiliser and <b>cattle</b> <b>slurry.</b> The N 2 O fluxes and N uptake by grass were measured from plots receiving calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) at four application rates, either with or without additional application of liquid <b>cattle</b> <b>slurry,</b> applied through shallow soil injection. The average emission factor for fertiliser-only treatments was 0. 15 %. The annual N 2 O emissions were similar for treatments receiving only fertiliser or only <b>cattle</b> <b>slurry.</b> In the first experimental year, application of <b>cattle</b> <b>slurry</b> increased the emission factor for fertiliser to 0. 35 %, but the second year showed no effect of <b>cattle</b> <b>slurry</b> on the emission from fertiliser. With regard to the first objective, we conclude that these results do not conclusively justify an adjusted emission factor for combined application of fertiliser and <b>cattle</b> <b>slurry.</b> To minimise risks however, it is sensible to avoid simultaneous application of fertiliser and <b>cattle</b> <b>slurry.</b> The N 2 O emission factor expressed as percentage of kg N uptake by grass was consistently higher after combined application of fertiliser and <b>cattle</b> <b>slurry</b> (0. 29 %), compared to fertiliser-only (0. 17 %).

40|$|Slurry is an {{important}} source of macronutrients, micro-nutrients and organic matter. Despite the considerable fertilizer value of slurry, it may be abundant in amounts of copper and zinc originating from dietary. The study presents quantitative changes in copper and zinc in individual <b>slurries</b> (pig and <b>cattle</b> <b>slurries).</b> The bioavailability of copper and zinc was estimated on the basis of amounts of the metals in isolated fractions using the sequential extraction method. Sequential techniques identify fractions which describe different connections of metals with the compost solid phase beginning with those that are easiest soluble up to those that dissolve with the greatest difficulties. Pig slurry was characterized by 2 -fold higher amounts of copper and zinc in comparison to the levels detected in <b>cattle</b> <b>slurries.</b> Quantitative changes of the elements in the sequentially isolated fractions of analyzed slurries differed. First of all, this was dependent on the chemical character of a given metal, followed by the animal species, or the type of management. Irrespective of the type of slurry, 40 - 56 % of the total amounts of copper were found in hardly available combinations, while available copper forms accounted for only 6. 6 – 10. 9 %. Zinc was found predominantly in com-binations with iron and manganese oxides which, irrespective of the tested slurry, ranged from 130. 64 mg·kg- 1 to 293. 60 mg·kg- 1. Bioavailable metal contents, potentially introduced to soil with slurry doses, calculated as 170 kg total N/ha/year, ranged from 63. 6 to 124. 5 g for copper, and from 349. 5 to 696. 4 g for zinc. The estimated amounts of metal inputs to agricultural land demonstrate that soils are potentially at risk of heavy metal accumulation from the application of pig and <b>cattle</b> <b>slurries...</b>|$|R

40|$|After {{anaerobic}} digestion (AD) of manures for biogas production {{the concentration of}} ammonium-N is increased and the concentration of decomposable carbon in manure is decreased. That implies that the first year fertilizer value of the manure can be increased by the treatment. However, pH is also increased by AD thereby increasing the risk of ammonia losses while the lowered dry matter content {{on the other hand}} improves the manure infiltration in soil and reduces the risk of ammonia loss. Therefore the effects of AD on plant N availability can be expected to interact with the manure application method used.

40|$|The use {{of maize}} (Zea mays) as a co-substrate with <b>cattle</b> <b>slurry</b> for the {{production}} of biogas was investigated in detail by running several long term digestion trials under different operational conditions in laboratory scale semi-continuous digesters. These conditions included varying the organic loading rate (OLR) from 2 to 6 g VS l- 1 d- 1, the proportion of <b>cattle</b> <b>slurry</b> from 25 to 100 %, and the recirculating regime. Results indicated that the co-digestion of <b>cattle</b> <b>slurry</b> and maize was viable at all loading rates tested with the greatest volumetric methane yield, 1. 46 l l- 1 d- 1, produced at a 5 g VS l- 1 d- 1 OLR consisting of 40 % cattle slurry; this corresponded to a specific methane yield of 0. 26 l g- 1 VS added. Successful digestion was shown at retention times as low as 15 days where a volumetric methane yield of 1. 26 l l- 1 was produced. Co-digestion had a pronounced effect on the volumetric methane yield with improvements of up to 355 % when compared to the digestion of <b>cattle</b> <b>slurry</b> alone. Additionally, the OLR could be doubled by the addition of an equal quantity of maize, on a VS basis, with the volumetric methane yield increasing by over 200 % without a great loss of the methane potential of the maize. For each trial undertaken in this research the actual methane yield produced from co-digestion was compared to that calculated to be produced. Support for synergy was shown in the first two trials where the actual methane yield exceeded that predicted however, the method used to calculate the predicted yield was suggested to be an inaccurate determination. To address this inaccuracy a trial was designed testing the digestion of the two substrates alone and together under the same operational conditions and methodology. A comparison between the mono and co-digestion trials indicated that the addition of maize to <b>cattle</b> <b>slurry</b> produced a methane yield that more or less equalled that calculated from the sum of the <b>cattle</b> <b>slurry</b> and maize alone. This brought the early indications of synergy into doubt with suggestions that they were the result of an inaccurate determination of the predicted yield and of inhibition washout. In the final part of the research an attempt was made to improve the volumetric methane yield by introducing solids recirculation to the co-digestion process with the objective of maintaining the slowly degradable fraction of the maize and <b>cattle</b> <b>slurry</b> in the digester for longer periods. This proved not to be a viable option with the methane production showing a decline; at an OLR of 5 g VS l- 1 d- 1, consisting of 50 % <b>cattle</b> <b>slurry,</b> a decline of 0. 31 l l- 1 d- 1 occurred. Solids recirculation was also introduced to the mono-digestion process to determine whether the differences shown in the co-digestion trial were a result of recirculating the solids of the <b>cattle</b> <b>slurry,</b> the maize or a combination of the two. Results showed that both substrates produced unstable conditions indicating that the co-digestion trial was not the result of just one substrate failing. Liquid recirculation was also tested on the co-digestion of the substrates and while no decline was observed no improvement was produced.

40|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} {{of animal}} manure and crop residues may {{be employed to}} produce biogas as a climate-neutral source of energy to provide fertilizers which allow recycling of plant nutrients on the farm. However, compared to fertilizing with the pristine input materials (e. g. raw animal slurry or plant residues), the effect on soil microbiota and soil fertility may be impacted due to the increased content of mineral nitrogen (N) and decreased amount of organic carbon (C); an issue of concern in especially organic farming systems. An incubation study was performed where 1) water, 2) raw <b>cattle</b> <b>slurry,</b> 3) anaerobically digested <b>cattle</b> <b>slurry</b> + maize, 4) anaerobically digested <b>cattle</b> <b>slurry</b> + grass-clover, or 5) fresh grass-clover was applied to soil at arable realistic rates. During the following 9 days experimental unites were sequentially sampled destructively and the soil assayed for content of mineral N, available organic C, microbial phospholipid fatty acids (community composition), catabolic response profiling (functional diversity) and emission of CO 2 and N 2 O. Fertilizing with the anaerobic digested materials increased the soil concentration of NO 3 - ca. 30 - 40 % compared to when raw slurry was applied. Grass-clover contributed with four times more readily degradable organic C than the other materials, causing an increased microbial biomass which depleted the soil for mineral N and probably also O 2. Consequently, grass-clover also caused a ~ 10 times increase in emissions of both CO 2 and N 2 O compared {{to any of the}} other treatments. Besides increasing the total microbial biomass, grass-clover also induced the largest changes in microbial diversity measures. Comparing to this, digested materials and raw <b>cattle</b> <b>slurry</b> only had little effect on the soil microbiota...|$|E
40|$|The Bachelor´s Thesis lists {{different}} methods for measurements of ammonia concentration {{according to the}} standards of Czech Technical Standards (ČSN) and the Research Institute of Agricultural Engineering (VÚZT Praha). Further, it includes selected methods for measurements of concentration of individual greenhouse gases. The project took place in the co-operative farm (ZD) Krásná Hora nad Vltavou. The ammonia concentration was first measured in the stables using the electronic sensors method and then using the method of measurement of the substrate in the measuring tunnel on pastures. In the stables, the obtained values from untreated <b>cattle</b> <b>slurry</b> and the obtained values from <b>cattle</b> <b>slurry</b> treated by AMALGEROL were being compared. The measurements of ammonia concentration on the pasture were focused on the ammonia release into the air after micro climatic and physical intervention...|$|E
40|$|Direct {{nitrous oxide}} (N 2 O) {{emissions}} from fertilized soils are generally estimated using emission factors. However, the emission factors for N 2 O emission of applied slurry {{are not well}} quantified. The effect of slurry application technique on N 2 O emission was quantified in field experiments in the Netherlands in order to derive N 2 O emission factors for (shallow) injected and surface-applied cattle and pig slurries. Fluxes of N 2 O were measured using a closed flux chamber technique and a photo-acoustic infra-red gasmonitor. Fluxes of N 2 O were measured 64 – 83 times on grassland on sandy and clay soils and maize land on sandy soil, in the period 2007 – 2009. There were large differences in total N 2 O emission between the years, and differences between treatments were not consistent {{over the years and}} sites. The average emission factor of all treatments and years (n = 35) was 0. 9 % of the N applied, which is close to the default IPCC emission factor of 1 %. However, the range in emission was large, i. e. from - 0. 2 % to 7. 0 %. The average emission factor for grassland was 1. 7 % of the N applied for calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN), 0. 4 % for shallow injected <b>cattle</b> <b>slurry,</b> and 0. 1 % for surface-applied <b>cattle</b> <b>slurry.</b> For maize land, the average emission factor for CAN was 0. 1 % of the N applied, for injected <b>cattle</b> <b>slurry</b> 0. 9 % and for surface-applied <b>cattle</b> <b>slurry</b> 0. 4 %. The emission factors for pig slurry applied to maize land were higher than for cattle slurry; 3. 6 % for injected pig slurry and 0. 9 % for surface-applied pig slurry. Increasing the N application rate on maize land resulted in higher emission factors for CAN, injected <b>cattle</b> <b>slurry,</b> and injected pig slurry. Concluding, on both grassland and maize land (shallow) injection of slurry increased the average emission factor of N 2 O in comparison to surface application. Differentiation of N 2 O emission factors which takes specific factors into account, such as N type and rate and application technique, can improve the quantification of N 2 O emission from agricultural soils and is needed to derive most efficient options for mitigation.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was {{determination}} of the inactivation rate of Salmonella Senftenberg W 775 and Salmonella Typhimurium in <b>cattle</b> and swine <b>slurry</b> stored under laboratory conditions at 4 and 20 °C. Salmonella bacilli underwent constant, gradual elimination from the slurry during its storage. This process occurred more efficiently in samples stored at 20 °C than at 4 °C. At both studied temperatures elimination of bacteria was faster in swine <b>slurry</b> than in <b>cattle.</b> Shorter survivability in research material, in both temperature variants and kinds of slurry, showed Salmonella Typhimurium...|$|R
40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted on}} a sloping grassland soil in southwest England to investigate the downslope transport of nitrogen in soil water following the application of <b>cattle</b> manure, <b>slurry</b> and inorganic fertilizer. Transport of nitrogen (N) species was monitored on hydrologically isolated plots. Manure (50 t ha− 1), slurry (50 m 3 ha− 1) and fertilizer (250 kg N ha− 1) were applied in February/March 1992. Subsurface water movement, by both matrix and preferential flow, was the dominant flow route during the experiment. Subsurface and surface nutrient flow pathways were monitored by analysing soil water and surface runoff for NO 3 -N, NH 4 -N and total N. Subsurface flow chemistry was dominated by NO 3 -N, with concentrations usually between 2 and 5 mg NO 3 −N dm− 3. Differences between fertilizer and manure treatments and the untreated control were not significant. Significantly elevated NO 3 -N concentrations were observed in soil water in the buffer zone, indicating {{the importance of a}} buffer zone at least 10 m wide between manure spreading zones and an adjacent water course...|$|R
