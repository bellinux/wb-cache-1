25|$|On 1 March 1912, Albert Berry used a {{headless}} Type XII {{to complete}} the first parachute jump from an airplane. Berry used a <b>conical</b> <b>parachute</b> with paper in between the folds to prevent entanglement. He climbed onto a trapeze like support {{on the front of}} the aircraft, cut the supporting cable and landed at Jefferson Barracks.|$|E
50|$|However, these {{designs were}} not always {{intended}} {{to be put into}} practice, and often practical limitations impeded the application of the revolutionary designs. For example, da Vinci's ideas on the <b>conical</b> <b>parachute</b> or the winged flying machine were only applied much later. While earlier scholars showed a tendency to attribute inventions based on their first pictorial appearance to individual Renaissance engineers, modern scholarship is more prone to view the devices as products of a technical evolution which often went back to the Middle Ages.|$|E
5000|$|The early-1960s era Corona {{reconnaissance}} satellite returned delicate film capsules to Earth that required mid-air retrieval by a JC-130 Hercules & HC-130 airlifter. These aircraft were manned by {{a crew of}} 10 personnel. The crew consisted of two pilots, one flight engineer, two telemetry operators, one winch operator, and four riggers. The telemetry operators would acquire {{the location of the}} satellite and relay the info to the pilots. Once visually acquired the pilots would head on course to the satellite descending towards the Pacific Ocean. One could visually acquire the satellite and its parachute at an altitude of approximately 50,000 ft. The winch operator and the riggers would deploy the retrieving apparatus called the [...] "Loop", which consisted of high quality nylon rope with a series of brass hooks spliced into the apparatus. The whole snatching operation by the pilots was done visually. The winch operator and the four riggers would deploy the loop. Once contact was made between the parachute and the loop the winch line would pay out and stop. The winch then was put into gear and the retrieval process commenced. Once on board, the aircraft flew back to Hickam Air Force Base, where they were stationed, where the satellite or canister was offloaded onto a truck and then loaded immediately onto a running C-141 airlifter and then transported to a location in Maryland for analysis. The crews acquired these skills by practicing almost daily on practice missions, carried out with other aircraft dropping dummy bombs with chutes attached. The weights were 200 lb. in the early 70s and later to the <b>conical</b> <b>parachute</b> system which weighed in at 1,100 lb.|$|E

40|$|A {{wind tunnel}} test has been {{conducted}} on one-eighth scale models of the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster drogue parachute system. The test included an investigation of four candidate drogue deployment concepts and a parametric steady state drag study of 20 -degree <b>conical</b> ribbon <b>parachutes.</b> The results show {{that at least two}} of the four deployment concepts tested are viable candidates for the full scale deployment system. The interference free steady state drag results obtained show excellent agreement with available drop test results on large 20 -degree <b>conical</b> ribbon <b>parachutes...</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{empirical}} formula for the steady state drag coefficient of a 20 degree <b>conical</b> ribbon <b>parachute</b> is developed. The derived expression {{takes into account}} the effect of suspension line length and geometric porosity within the limits of practical design. Also included are factors which provide drag reduction due to skirt reefing and the wake behind a primary body. The calculated values are in agreement with the available experimental results...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the parachutes {{that have been}} drop tested {{in support of the}} Ares I first stage deceleration system development. The results of the tests show that the reefing ratios for these quarter spherical ribbon parachutes provide the same reefed drag area as historical <b>conical</b> ribbon <b>parachutes.</b> Two sources are investigated for properly normalizing the parachutes relative to their suspension line length, and one is found to be superior. Nomenclature D = nominal diameter of the parachute Le = equivalent length of a suspension system I...|$|R
50|$|The non-stiffened Francis Rogallo parawing, the Domina Jalbert founded parafoil wing, {{or other}} {{modified}} fully flexible wings (Barish sailwing, KiteShip wing, parasails, modified <b>conical</b> <b>parachutes)</b> do not {{lend themselves to}} a mounting of a prime moving engine or motor to them; rather the kiting lines to the unpowered wing terminate below the wing to a static or mobile anchoring; that anchoring itself may be with its own active thrusting engine or motor or the anchor (which could be payload, pilot, or both payload and pilot) may simply fall by gravity force—and thus by gravity tug the wing through the ktie lines. When the payload or pilot is simply falling without adding a prime moving engine or motor, then the kited flexible wing is a paragliding wing; when the payload or pilot is additionally arranged with a thrust engine or motor, then the kited unpowered flexible wing with such thrusted payload or pilot is a powered aircraft system or powered paragliding system. The control systems are varied for particular applications (ranging from lowering military payloads, autonomous powered paragliders or drones, sport paragliding, sport powered paragliding, scale-model paragliding, scale-model powered paragliding). All variations have in common the unpowered kite {{whether or not the}} payload and/or pilot is powered.|$|R
40|$|Multiple {{wind tunnel}} test trials were {{conducted}} on a 30 degree <b>conical</b> ribbon <b>parachute</b> with porosities of 30, 27, and 24 percent. Variables were Mach number, dynamic pressure, towline length, and coefficient of drag. A Rotofoil parachute having a porosity of approximately 24 percent was tested, but failed after about 30 seconds of operation at a Mach number of 1. 8 All of the parachutes had a nominal diameter and shroud line length of 10 inches. Drag coefficients {{were based on the}} area of a circle having a diameter two-thirds of the nominal parachute diameter...|$|R
50|$|The {{recovery}} sequence {{begins with}} {{the operation of the}} high-altitude baroswitch, which triggers the pyrotechnic nose cap thrusters. This ejects the nose cap, which deploys the pilot parachute. Nose cap separation occurs at a nominal altitude of 15704 ft, about 218 seconds after SRB separation. The 11.5 ft diameter <b>conical</b> ribbon pilot <b>parachute</b> provides the force to pull lanyards attached to cut knives, which cut the loop securing the drogue retention straps. This allows the pilot chute to pull the drogue pack from the SRB, causing the drogue suspension lines to deploy from their stored position. At full extension of the twelve 105 ft suspension lines, the drogue deployment bag is stripped away from the canopy, and the 54 ft diameter <b>conical</b> ribbon drogue <b>parachute</b> inflates to its initial reefed condition. The drogue disreefs twice after specified time delays (using redundant 7 and 12-second reefing line cutters), and it reorients/stabilizes the SRB for main chute deployment. The drogue parachute has a design load of approximately 315000 lb and weighs approximately 1200 lb.|$|R
40|$|The film depicts {{two tests}} {{of a flat}} roof, <b>conical</b> inlet canopy <b>parachute.</b> The first test {{is a series of}} wind tunnel trials with a flat {{circular}} ribbon roof of 22 percent porosity. The second test is a single series of wind tunnel trials with a flat circular ribbon roof of 25 percent porosity. Variables for both trials include Mach number, dynamic pressure, longitudinal separation distances (x/d), and drag coefficient C(sub d) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{performance characteristics}} have been determined for the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster drogue, main, and pilot parachutes. The performance evaluation on the 20 -degree <b>conical</b> ribbon <b>parachutes</b> is {{based primarily on}} air drop tests of full scale prototype parachutes. In addition, parametric wind tunnel tests were performed and used in parachute configuration development and preliminary performance assessments. The wind tunnel test data are compared to the drop test results and both sets of data are {{used to determine the}} predicted performance of the Solid Rocket Booster flight parachutes. Data from other drop tests of large ribbon parachutes are also compared with the Solid Rocket Booster parachute performance characteristics. Parameters assessed include full open terminal drag coefficients, reefed drag area, opening characteristics, clustering effects, and forebody interference...|$|R
50|$|After the drogue chute has {{stabilized}} the SRB in a tail-first attitude, the frustum {{is separated}} from the forward skirt by a pyrotechnic charge triggered by the low-altitude baroswitch at a nominal altitude of 5500 ft about 243 seconds after SRB separation. The frustum is then {{pulled away from the}} SRB by the drogue chute. The main chute suspension lines are pulled out from deployment bags that remain in the frustum. At full extension of the lines, which are 203 ft long, the three main chutes are pulled from their deployment bags and inflate to their first reefed condition. The frustum and drogue parachute continue on a separate trajectory to splashdown. After specified time delays (using redundant 10 and 17-second reefing line cutters), the main chute reefing lines are cut and the chutes inflate to their second reefed and full open configurations. The main chute cluster decelerates the SRB to terminal conditions. Each of the 136 ft diameter, 20-degree <b>conical</b> ribbon <b>parachutes</b> have a design load of approximately 195000 lb and each weighs approximately 2180 lb. These parachutes are the largest that have ever been used — both in deployed size and load weight. The RSRM nozzle extension is severed by a pyrotechnic charge about 20 seconds after frustum separation.|$|R
40|$|A {{subscale}} {{wind tunnel}} test program for Orion's <b>conical</b> ribbon drogue <b>parachute</b> is under development. The desired goals of the program are to quantify aerodynamic performance of the parachute {{in the wake of}} the entry vehicle, including understanding of the coupling of the parachute and command module dynamics, and an improved understanding of the load distribution within the textile elements of the parachute. The test program is ten percent of full scale conducted in a 3 x 2. 1 m (10 x 7 ft) closed loop subsonic wind tunnel. The subscale test program is uniquely suited to probing the aerodynamic and structural environment in both a quantitative and qualitative manner. Non-intrusive diagnostics, including Particle Image Velocimetry for wake velocity surveys, high speed pressure transducers for canopy pressure distribution, and a high speed photogrammetric reconstruction, will be used to quantify the parachute's performance...|$|R
