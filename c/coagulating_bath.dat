40|$|Abstract. Epoxidized {{natural rubber}} (ENR) / silica (Si) organic-inorganic {{composites}} were prepared {{by using a}} sol-gel technique. The choice of ENR (50 mol % epoxidation level), as a matrix was made because of its polar nature which can interact with the silica. The processing of the masterbatch {{was carried out by}} sol-gel method at room temperature by dispersing the silica in the rubber and <b>coagulated</b> with steam <b>bath.</b> The performance of the composites was evaluated in this work for the viability of ENR/Si in tyre compounding. Compounding was carried out on a two roll mill, where the additives and curing agents was later mixed. Characterization of these composites was performed by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) for dispersion as well as mechanical testing. Silica was also efficient as primary reinforcing filler in ENR with regard to modulus and tensile strength, resulting on an increase in the stiffness of the rubbers. Improvement in tensile strength over the control crosslinked rubber sample was probably due to synergisms of silica reinforcement and crosslinking of the rubber phase...|$|R

The inventive method consists in, first, flouring the food product to be battered and applying a reconstituted batter to the floured food product, said batter containing a cellulose derivative which <b>coagulates</b> in a <b>bath</b> of hot water {{in the presence of}} water vapour. The battered food product is subsequently heated and coagulated using a standard infrared or microwave oven, such that the layer of coagulated batter does not break up when cooled. Finally, the product is cooled and frozen. The purpose of the invention is the elimination of the most problematic step in standard batter processes, namely prefrying.

30|$|Because of {{the high}} {{crystallinity}} and hydrogen bonds, there is less possibility for the cellulosic polymer to dissolve in usual solvent, and a special equipment is needed for quicker evaporation and a supplementary material needed to reduce the fluid viscosity. Despite introducing different solvent systems for producing cellulosic nanofibers, there are some kinds of problems such as spiraling costs, toxicities of materials, and dependence on <b>coagulating</b> <b>bath</b> during electrospinning process. The current study tried to apply biocompatible solvent, and environmental-friendly, inexpensive. and accessible supplementary material. Moreover, the analysis {{was carried out by}} the possibility of producing cellulosic nanofiber derived from rice straw. In addition, the optimal condition for producing cellulosic nanofiber and its corresponding physical and chemical properties were obtained based on spectroscopic and microscopic data.|$|E
40|$|The {{strength}} of wet-spun poly(vinyl alcohol) (pva) fibres is given as function of bath-stretching, wet-stretching and hot-stretching. In the two equations derived for {{strength of}} wet-stretching and hot-stretching the complex {{influence of the}} bath-stretching and hot-stretching is demonstrated. The bath-stretching is connected with a pure orientation effect and the residence time in the <b>coagulating</b> <b>bath</b> which is a measure for the ‘freshness’ of the fibre. The hot-stretching can be separated in a pure orientation effect and a crystallization effect. Fibres of the pva, used in the experiments, were soluble in boiling water. After shrinkage of the fibres at temperatures near the temperature of hot-stretching, the dissolution temperature can be raised. Insoluble pva fibres were prepared after removing most of the bulky residual ester groups...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} investigated carbon {{molecular sieve}} (CMS) membranes through the dry/wetphase inversion method from the casting polyetherimide (PEI) on alumina support for hydrogen separation. Different coating {{techniques such as}} dry method (slide casting followed by drying under vacuum; and spin coating followed by drying under vacuum); and wet method (spin coating and then later kept in an isopropyl alcohol (IPA) /water <b>coagulating</b> <b>bath)</b> at different pyrolysis temperatures of 550, 600 650 degrees C min(- 1) were also investigated. The membranes were extensively characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) for surface morphology studies and thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) for thermal properties. The best performance was obtained from CMS membranes fabricated with the dry-phase method (slide casting/vacuum) and pyrolysis at 600 degrees C, where the H- 2 /N- 2 permselectivity was 16. 2. In contrast with the wet-phase, the increase in gas permselectivity by the dry-phase (slide casting/vacuum) {{was believed to be}} due to the quick solidification that prevents rearrangement of polymer aggregates and coalescence of the nascent voids formed due to the spinodal or nucleation growth.

40|$|In tissue {{engineering}} practice, a scaffold is often needed to deliver cells {{to the desired}} body site needing to be repaired. Scaffolds supporting cells can be either implanted through a surgical operation or injected through a laparoscopic device. The latter option is a first-choice in cases where a small and irregularly shaped defect needs to be regenerated. In such circumstances, the cell carrier has to be miniaturised while maintaining the morphological features that make a scaffold an efficient cell culture support, i. e. a uniform and adequate porous texture in terms of pore and interconnect dimensions. In this work, we illustrate a novel and powerful method for the manufacturing of monodisperse porous beads of tailorable dimension (in the range ~ 300 ÷ 1500 m) and with an internal porous texture characterised by uniformly sized and fully interconnected pores. The fabrication method relies {{on the use of}} a flow-focusing microfluidic chip that generates a monodisperse oil-in-water emulsion (panel b). The aqueous phase of the emulsion contains a biopolymer and an appropriate surfactant. Here, we demonstrate that by extruding the emulsion through a needle immersed in a perfluorinated oil on top of which a coagulating aqueous bath is stratified and by applying a pulsed electrical field (panel a), it is possible to precisely control the size of the emulsion droplets detached from the needle. As soon as the emulsion droplets reach the interface between the perfluorinated oil and <b>coagulating</b> <b>bath,</b> they instantaneously solidify. An inverse relationship exist between intensity of the applied voltage and beads dimension (panels c,d,e). The presented process is very repeatable and brings about to beads rigorously monodisperse in size (panel f). Finally, such microbeads demonstrated to be a successful cell carrier...|$|E
