40|$|Background: The global HIV {{prevention}} {{community is}} implementing voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) programs across {{eastern and southern}} Africa, with a goal of reaching 80 % coverage in adult males by 2015. Successful implementation {{will depend on the}} accessibility of commodities essential for VMMC programming and the appropriate allocation of resources to support the VMMC supply chain. For this, the United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, in collaboration with the World Health Organization and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, has developed a standard list of commodities for VMMC programs. Methods and Findings: This list of commodities was used to inform program planning for a 1 -y program to circumcise 152, 000 adult men in Swaziland. During this process, additional key commodities were identified, expanding the standard list to include <b>commodities</b> for waste <b>management,</b> HIV counseling and testing, and the treatment of sexually transmitted infections. The approximate costs for the procurement of <b>commodities,</b> <b>management</b> of a supply chain, and waste disposal, were determined for the VMMC program in Swaziland using current market prices of goods and services. Previous costing studies of VMMC programs did not capture supply chain costs, nor the full range of commodities needed for VMM...|$|R
