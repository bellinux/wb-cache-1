One of the {{exhibits}} is what is claimed to be the world's largest <b>coloured</b> <b>pencil.</b> Fitz Park, {{on the bank of the}} River Greta, is home to the Keswick Museum and Art Gallery, a Victorian museum which features the Musical Stones of Skiddaw, Southey manuscripts, and a collection of sculptures and paintings of regional and wider importance, including works by Epstein, John Opie, Richard Westall and others. After extensive restoration and enlargement the museum reopened in 2014. In 2001 the cricket ground in Fitz Park was named the most beautiful in England by Wisden Cricket Monthly.|$|E
500|$|An {{expensive}} film to produce, Granpa is hand-illustrated with <b>coloured</b> <b>pencil,</b> imitating Burningham's {{style in}} the book. It was directed by Dianne Jackson, who had previously adapted The Snowman by Raymond Briggs (1978), a wordless picture book, as an exceptionally successful family-oriented animated film (1982). Howard Blake, who wrote the music for The Snowman, wrote {{the music and the}} script for Granpa, which is referred to as an [...] "animated children's opera". The voices of Granpa and Emily are by Peter Ustinov and Emily Osborne.|$|E
2500|$|Tolkien created {{numerous}} pencil {{sketches and}} {{two pieces of}} more detailed artwork portraying Smaug. The latter were a detailed ink and watercolour labelled Conversation with Smaug and a rough <b>coloured</b> <b>pencil</b> and ink sketch entitled Death of Smaug. While neither of these appeared in the original printing of The Hobbit due to cost constraints, both {{have been included in}} subsequent editions and Conversation with Smaug has been used extensively. [...] Death of Smaug was used for the cover of an early UK paperback edition of The Hobbit.|$|E

60|$|Lying in bed {{would be}} an {{altogether}} perfect and supreme experience if only one had a <b>coloured</b> <b>pencil</b> long enough {{to draw on the}} ceiling. This, however, is not generally a part of the domestic apparatus on the premises. I think myself that the thing might be managed with several pails of Aspinall and a broom. Only if one worked in a really sweeping and masterly way, and laid on the colour in great washes, it might drip down again on one's face in floods of rich and mingled colour like some strange fairy rain; and that would have its disadvantages. I am afraid it would be necessary to stick to black and white in this form of artistic composition. To that purpose, indeed, the white ceiling would be of the greatest possible use; in fact, it is the only use I think of a white ceiling being put to.|$|E

50|$|In 1958 after observing school {{children}} drawing in Baker Lake, Oonark casually remarked {{to the school}} teacher that she could draw better than that. The next summer in 1959, the teacher shared this comment with Canadian Wildlife Service biologist, Dr. Andrew Macpherson, who was in Baker Lake studying Arctic fox. Macpherson gave her <b>coloured</b> <b>pencils</b> and paper, purchased her drawings and brought {{some of them to}} Ottawa. Macpherson continued to send her <b>coloured</b> <b>pencils</b> and a drawing pad after his return to Ottawa in the late fall of 1959. In the spring of 1960 Oonark sent him twelve completed drawings in the sketchbook via the Northern Services Officer Tom Butlers.|$|R

5000|$|Gilbert's art {{has been}} called [...] "fantastically elaborate". She draws many of her works with <b>coloured</b> <b>pencils,</b> despite calling them [...] "such an {{unreliable}} medium," [...] in part because she dislikes the mess associated with using paint, ink, or clay.|$|R
50|$|She taught {{school in}} Victoria before {{becoming}} an illustrator.

50|$|Marco Mazzoni (born 17 January 1982) is a Milan-based Italian artist, {{originally}} from Tortona.

5000|$|First {{working with}} {{graphite}} pencil, Pitseolak would later {{move on to}} <b>coloured</b> <b>pencil</b> and felt-tip pens, which, according to Lalonde, became her favored medium because their [...] "rich and vibrant colours" [...] best expressed [...] "the joyfulness that characterizes her work".|$|E
50|$|Annie Pootoogook (May 11, 1969 - September 19, 2016) was a Canadian Inuk Artist {{known for}} her pen and <b>coloured</b> <b>pencil</b> drawings.

50|$|Pudlo Pudlat (Pudlo), (February 4, 1916 at Kamadjuak Camp, Baffin Island, Canada, - December 28, 1992, at Cape Dorset) was an Inuit {{artist whose}} {{preferred}} medium {{was a combination}} of acrylic wash and <b>coloured</b> <b>pencils.</b> His works are in the collections of most Canadian museums.

50|$|Jay Burridge - {{who wears}} a blue shirt, often {{appeared}} as 'Man of Letters', wearing a postman's cap and carrying a messenger bag covered with alphabet letters. This contains items all starting with a particular letter of the alphabet which he then uses to produce a piece of art. He also presented another segment where he demonstrates effective methods to make pictures like <b>coloured</b> <b>pencils,</b> wax crayons and so on.|$|R
50|$|Pudlo's art is {{characterized}} by a playful sense of humour and a fascination with the trappings of modern life, especially airplanes. His early drawings are simple outlines made with lead pencil. In the mid-1960s, Pudlo began to work with <b>coloured</b> <b>pencils</b> and felt-tipped pens, and his art became more elaborate. In many ways Pudlo's work symbolizes the paradoxes of the encounter between traditional Inuit culture and modern life.|$|R
50|$|A {{colored pencil}} (US-English), <b>coloured</b> <b>pencil</b> (UK-English) or pencil crayon (Canada-English) {{is an art}} medium {{constructed}} of a narrow, pigmented core encased in a wooden cylindrical case. Unlike graphite and charcoal pencils, colored pencils’ cores are wax- or oil-based and contain varying proportions of pigments, additives, and binding agents. Water-soluble (watercolor) pencils and pastel pencils are also manufactured as well as colored leads for mechanical pencils.|$|E
50|$|Schröder Sonnenstern's {{paintings}} depict erotic {{and often}} disturbing figures {{that are part}} human and part monster, with distorted body parts such as breasts and genitalia. He used <b>coloured</b> <b>pencil</b> over a thin wash of paint to give depth to his line drawings. Notable works include the demonic Zynus Theory (1953), Vitanovaseturine (1951-2) and several works {{on the theme of}} the Fall of man, including Uschastelynore (1951) and The Snake Seduction (1955).|$|E
50|$|His {{abstract}} paintings (initially on canvas, then on linen) {{went from}} monochrome to subtle gradations of tone, which became more gestural, pulsating or woven. McKeown's work has connections with {{certain aspects of}} minimalist, post-minimalist, post-painterly and conceptual art. He particularly admired the work of Agnes Martin, for instance. He also made small realistic <b>coloured</b> <b>pencil</b> drawings of the wild flowers typical of his home county (primrose, snowdrop, buttercup), always against stark blank paper.|$|E
50|$|The use of crayon or pastel {{sticks of}} ground {{pigments}} in {{various levels of}} saturation is also considered a highly skilled colourist's domain, as it requires knowledge of drawing techniques. Like oils, crayons and pastels generally obscure the original photograph, which produces portraits more akin to traditional paintings. Charcoal and <b>coloured</b> <b>pencils</b> are also used in hand-colouring of photographs and the terms crayon, pastel, charcoal, and pencil were often used interchangeably by colourists.|$|R
50|$|They {{may also}} {{be called upon to}} depict those very probes and {{satellites}} (often working with NASA or JPL scientists) - for who is out there to photograph them? They paint in oils, acrylics, gouache and markers, use pens, pastels or <b>coloured</b> <b>pencils,</b> or the latest digital technology. But these artists have an advantage over mere technology, for they can travel where machines cannot; and this includes into the past, the future and faster than light.|$|R
50|$|Suddenly, {{towards the}} end of 1983, Devalle dropped photography, which he had begun to find too {{restrictive}} a partner and reverted to drawing with a model, recovering pre-avant grade historical movements working techniques, thus trying to find his personal position between traditional and modernity. He then began a new cycle of work: Ritratti (portraits) and Nature morte (still-lives) from life, executed in <b>coloured</b> <b>pencils</b> and pastel crayons. In 1983 he had a solo exhibition at the Galleria Lorenzelli.|$|R
