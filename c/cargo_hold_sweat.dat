However, Melbourne Airport security footage proved the incident was a hoax after they produced video showing Salah boarding the plane with the airline noting that a bag of his weight would not be loaded on the plane without investigation nor would a passenger in the plane's unheated <b>cargo</b> <b>hold</b> emerge <b>sweating.</b>|$|R

25|$|Investigators {{devised a}} new test {{involving}} a <b>cargo</b> <b>hold</b> with {{conditions similar to}} the conditions of Flight 295; the plastic covers and extra pallets provided fuel for the fire, which would spread quickly before generating enough smoke to activate smoke alarms. The hotter flame achieved in the new test heated {{the air in the}} <b>cargo</b> <b>hold.</b> This heated air had a higher pressure than normal, and overcame the pressure differential between the <b>cargo</b> <b>hold</b> and the passenger cabin. When the door between the passenger and <b>cargo</b> <b>holds</b> was open, smoke and gases therefore flowed into the passenger cabin.|$|R
50|$|At 10:53, an {{explosion}} in the <b>cargo</b> <b>hold</b> occurred; the reasons are unknown. It is supposed that some of the fuel tanks were damaged and fuel vapors drifted into the burning <b>cargo</b> <b>hold,</b> causing {{an explosion}}.|$|R
