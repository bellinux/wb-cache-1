The distance Δ along the meridian from one end point to a point at the same latitude as the second end point is then calculated by trigonometry. The surface distance Δ is reduced to Δ', the corresponding distance at mean sea level. The intermediate distances to points on the meridian at the same latitudes as other stations of the survey may also be calculated.|$|E

(1) We show that it is strongly NP-hard {{to decide whether}} a given polygonal linkage is realizable in the plane when the bodies are convex polygons and their contact graph is a tree; the problem is weakly NP-hard already for a chain of rectangles, but efficiently decidable for a <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>triangles</b> hinged at distinct vertices.

40|$|Abstract. We prove a deletion-contraction {{formula for}} motivic Feynman rules {{given by the}} classes of the affine graph hypersurface {{complement}} in the Grothendieck ring of varieties. We derive explicit recursions and generating series for these motivic Feynman rules under the operation of multiplying edges in a graph and we compare it with similar formulae for the Tutte polynomial of graphs, both being specializations of the same universal recursive relation. We obtain similar recursions for graphs that are chains of polygons and for graphs obtained by replacing an edge by a <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>triangles.</b> We show that the deletion-contraction relation can be lifted {{to the level of}} the category of mixed motives in the form of a distinguished triangle, similarly to what happens in categorifications of graph invariants. 1...|$|E
40|$|The terminal-edge Delaunay algorithm, {{initially}} called Lepp-Delaunay algorithm, {{deals with}} the construction of size-optimal (adapted to the geometry) quality triangulation of complex objects. In two dimensions, the algorithm can be formulated in terms of the Delaunay insertion of both midpoints of terminal edges (the common longest-edge of a pair of Delaunay triangles) and midpoints of boundary related edges in the current mesh mesh. For the processing of a small angled triangle in the current mesh, the terminal-edge is found as the nal longest-edge of the nite <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>triangles</b> that neighbor on a longest edge - the longest edge propagating path of the small angled triangle. Three boundary related point insertion operations which prevent nonconvergence behavior are discussed in detail.

2500|$|The modern {{systematic}} use of triangulation networks {{stems from}} the work of the Dutch mathematician Willebrord Snell (born Willebrord Snel van Royen), who in 1615 surveyed the distance from Alkmaar to Bergen op Zoom, approximately 70 miles (110 kilometres), using a <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> quadrangles containing 33 triangles in all. The two towns were separated by one degree on the meridian, so from his measurement he was able to calculate a value for the circumference of the earth – a feat celebrated in the title of his book Eratosthenes Batavus (The Dutch Eratosthenes), published in 1617. [...] Snell's methods were taken up by Jean Picard who in 1669–70 surveyed one degree of latitude along the Paris Meridian using a <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> thirteen <b>triangles</b> stretching north from Paris to the clocktower of Sourdon, near Amiens.|$|R

We compute bounds for the domination number of some heuristics for both the fixed spectrum version of the frequency assignment problem and the minimum span frequency assignment problem. Our results show that the standard greedy algorithm does not perform well, compared to some slightly more advanced algorithms, which is what we would expect. In this thesis we furthermore give some background and motivation for the topics being investigated, as well as mentioning several open problems. EPSR...|$|R
50|$|Snell's {{methods were}} {{taken up by}} Jean Picard who in 1669-70 {{surveyed}} one degree of latitude along the Paris Meridian using a <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> thirteen <b>triangles</b> stretching north from Paris to the clocktower of Sourdon, near Amiens. Thanks to improvements in instruments and accuracy, Picard's is rated as the first reasonably accurate measurement of the radius of the earth. Over the next century this work was extended most notably by the Cassini family: between 1683 and 1718 Jean-Dominique Cassini and his son Jacques Cassini surveyed {{the whole of the}} Paris meridian from Dunkirk to Perpignan; and between 1733 and 1740 Jacques and his son César Cassini undertook the first triangulation of the whole country, including a re-surveying of the meridian arc, leading to the publication in 1745 of the first map of France constructed on rigorous principles.|$|R
40|$|We use non-perturbative linked-cluster {{expansions}} {{to determine}} the ground-state energy per site of the spin-one Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice. To this end, a parameter is introduced allowing to interpolate between a fully trimerized state and the isotropic model. The ground-state energy per site of the full graph decomposition up to graphs <b>of</b> six <b>triangles</b> (18 spins) displays a complex behaviour {{as a function of}} this parameter close to the isotropic model which we attribute to divergencies of partial series in the graph expansion of quasi- 1 d unfrustrated chain graphs. More concretely, these divergencies {{can be traced back to}} a quantum critical point of the one-dimensional unfrustrated <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> coupled <b>triangles.</b> Interestingly, the reorganization of the non-perturbative linked-cluster expansion in terms of clusters with enhanced symmetry yields a ground-state energy per site of the isotropic two-dimensional model being in quantitative agreement with other numerical approaches in favor of a spontaneous trimerization of the system. Our findings are of general importance for any non-perturbative linked-cluster expansion on geometrically frustrated systems. Comment: 8 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
40|$|We study a {{one-dimensional}} <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> corner-sharing <b>triangles</b> with antiferromagnetic Ising interactions {{along its}} bonds. Classically, {{this system is}} highly frustrated with an extensive entropy at T = 0 and exponentially decaying spin correlations. We show that {{the introduction of a}} quantum dynmamics via a transverse magnetic field removes the entropy and opens a gap, but leaves the ground state disordered at all values of the transverse field, thereby providing an analog of the "disorder by disorder" scenario first proposed by Anderson and Fazekas in their search for resonating valence bond states. Our conclusion relies on exact diagonalization calculations {{as well as on the}} analysis of a 14 th order series expansion about the large transverse field limit. This test suggests that the series method could be used to search for other instances of quantum disordered states in frustrated transverse field magnets in higher dimensions.

40|$|Motivated {{by recent}} work on Heisenberg antiferromagnetic spin systems on various lattices made up <b>of</b> <b>triangles,</b> {{we examine the}} {{low-energy}} properties <b>of</b> a <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> antiferromagnetically coupled <b>triangles</b> <b>of</b> half-odd-integer spins. We derive the low-energy effective Hamiltonian to second order in {{the ratio of the}} coupling $J_ 2 $ between triangles to the coupling $J_ 1 $ within each triangle. The effective Hamiltonian contains four states for each triangle which are given by the products of spin- 1 / 2 states with the states of a pseudospin 1 / 2. We compare the results obtained by exact diagonalization of the effective Hamiltonian with those obtained for the full Hamiltonian using exact diagonalization and the density-matrix renormalization group method. It is found that the effective Hamiltonian gives an accurate value for the ground-state energy only if the ratio $J_ 2 /J_ 1 $ is less than about 0. 2 and that too for the spin- 1 / 2 case with linear topology. The <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> spin- 1 / 2 triangles shows interesting properties like spontaneous dimerization and several singlet and triplet low-energy ~possibly gapless! states which lie close to the ground state. We have also studied the spin- 3 / 2 case and find the low-energy effective Hamiltonians (LEH’s) to be less accurate there than in the spin- 1 / 2 case. Finally, we have studied nonlinear topologies where the LEH results deviate further from the exact results...|$|R
