5|$|Bulgaria is in a {{state of}} {{demographic}} crisis. It has had negative population growth since the early 1990s, when the economic collapse caused a long-lasting emigration wave. Some 937,000 to 1,200,000 people—mostly young adults—left the country by 2005. The total fertility rate (TFR) was estimated in 2013 at 1.43 children born/woman, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1. A third of all households consist of only one person and 75.5 percent of families do not have children under the age of 16. Consequently, population growth and birth rates are among the lowest in the world while death rates are among the highest. The majority of <b>children</b> <b>are</b> <b>born</b> to unmarried women (of all births 57.4 percent were outside marriage in 2012).|$|E

5|$|The {{parents of}} the {{affected}} individual are typically genetically normal. The extra chromosome occurs by chance. The possibility increases from less than 0.1% in 20-year-old mothers to 3% in those age 45. There is no known behavioral activity or environmental factor that changes the possibility. Down syndrome can be identified during pregnancy by prenatal screening followed by diagnostic testing or after birth by direct observation and genetic testing. More <b>children</b> <b>are</b> <b>born</b> with Down syndrome in countries where abortion is not allowed and in countries where pregnancy more commonly occurs at a later age. About 1.4 per 1000 live births in the United States and 1.1 per 1000 live births in Norway are affected. In the 1950s, in the United States, it occurred in 2 per 1000 live births with the decrease since then due to prenatal screening and abortions. The number of pregnancies with Down syndrome is more than two times greater with many spontaneously aborting. It {{is the cause of}} 8% of all congenital disorders.|$|E

25|$|Japan is {{experiencing}} {{a dramatic increase in}} the number of international marriages between a Japanese and a non-Japanese. In 2007, 40,272 international marriages between a Japanese national and foreigner occurred, representing 5.6% of total marriages (719,822). In 2000, the number was 36,263, and in 1980 the number was only 7,261. This is despite the fact that the foreigners represent only about 1.22% of the total population in Japan. An estimated 20,000 <b>children</b> <b>are</b> <b>born</b> to Japanese-foreign couples every year.

25|$|In 1994, only 15% of white, 6% of Hispanic, and 5% of African-American deaf {{high school}} {{graduates}} in the United States read above the sixth-grade level. In 1986, the median reading level of deaf American {{high school graduates}} was fourth grade. These concerning numbers are generally the result of varying levels of early language exposure. Most deaf <b>children</b> <b>are</b> <b>born</b> to hearing parents, which usually leaves a deficiency in their language exposure and development compared to children and parents who use the same modality to communicate. This group of children acquire {{a wide range of}} proficiency in a first language, which then impacts their ability to become proficient in a second (though sometimes possibly a first) language in the written modality. Children exposed to Manually Coded English (MCE) as their primary form of communication show lower literary levels than their ASL signing peers. However in countries such as Sweden which have adopted a bilingual–bicultural policy in their schools for the deaf, one sees a higher literacy rate compared to school systems favoring an oral tradition.|$|E

The world itself is divided into four regions, each dominated by a specific mood and environment. The city of Luxerion is a capital of worship whose people are loyal to the Order.

The Wildlands is an untamed area where the human city of Academia used to stand; it also houses the remains of Valhalla, the capital of Etro.
