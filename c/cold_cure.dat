Physical property of <b>cold</b> <b>curing</b> acrylic shows {{to have very}} small dimensional change resulted from imperfect polymerization process and if dimensional change occurs, it would cause improper use of orthodontic appliance. Orthodontic acrylic base plate which is made of <b>cold</b> <b>curing</b> acrylic, {{in order to achieve}} good result, it is suggested to use hydro flask or polyclav with water temperature 45 ° – 50 ° C and polyclav and pressure in 2 – 3 atm during polymerization process.

The {{purpose of the present study}} is to know the difference in dimensional accuracy of orthodontic acrylic at various polymerization temperature. The samples of the study were 18 acrylic base plate sized 65 × 10 × 25 mm classified into 3 control groups with polymerization temperature at 30 ° C, 40 ° C and 50 ° C. Measurement was done using caliper in order to know dimensional accuracy of orthodontic acrylic. The measurement result was tabulated and One-Way ANOVA test one was done with significant level 95 %, the probability result 0, 0055 was found which means there was significant difference among each control group.

50|$|Research {{into the}} effect of zinc {{lozenges}} on colds between 1984 and 2009 produced {{a wide range of}} differing results. It has been hypothesized that these differences were due in part to differences in the lozenges' constituents, mainly the amount of the active ingredient, ionic zinc (iZn). For example, the amount of ionic zinc ranged from 0 to 100%, depending upon the lozenge ingredients in the trials. More recently, the evidence from trials has been reviewed to try and assess the evidence of zinc's effectiveness as a <b>cold</b> <b>cure</b> but the results, while suggestive of a positive effect, have not been conclusive, since no consideration was given to the amount of the active ingredient (iZn) in the lozenges.|$|E

40|$|O bjectives: Heat-polymerized {{acrylic resin}} {{has been the}} most {{commonly}} used denture base material for over 60 years. However, the mechanical strength of acrylic resin is not adequate for long-term clinical performance of dentures. Consequently, fracture is a com- mon clinical occurrence, which often occurs in the midline of denture base. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of <b>cold</b> <b>cure</b> and heat cure acrylic resins, rein- forced with glass fibers, polyethylene fibers, and metal wire for denture base repair. Materials and Methods: Ninety specimens were prepared and allocated to nine groups. Ten specimens were included in the control group, and 80 were allocated to 8 experi- mental groups. In the experimental groups, the specimens were sectioned into two halves from the middle, and were then divided into two main groups: one group was repaired with heat cure acrylic resin, and the other with <b>cold</b> <b>cure</b> acrylic resin. Each group was di- vided into 4 subgroups: unreinforced, reinforced with glass fibers, polyethylene fibers, and metal wire. All specimens were then subjected to a 3 -point bending test, and the flexural strength was calculated. Results: The group repaired with heat cure acrylic resin and reinforced with glass fiber showed the highest flexural strength; however, the group repaired with <b>cold</b> <b>cure</b> acrylic resin and reinforced with polyethylene fibers had the lowest flexural strength. There {{was no significant difference between}} the groups repaired with heat cure and <b>cold</b> <b>cure</b> acrylic resins without reinforcement.

40|$|Foams are {{cellular}} structures, {{produced by}} gas bubbles formed during the polyurethane polymerization mixture. Flexible PU foams meet {{the following two}} criteria: have a limited resistance to an applied load, being both permeable to air and reversibly deformable. There are two main types of flexible foams, hot and <b>cold</b> <b>cure</b> foams differing in composition and processing temperatures. The hot cure foams are widely applied and represent the main composition of actual foams, while <b>cold</b> <b>cure</b> foams present several processing and property advantages, e. g, faster demoulding time, better humid aging properties and more versatility, as hardness variation with index changes are greater than with hot cure foams. The processing of <b>cold</b> <b>cure</b> foams also is attractive due to the low energy consumption (mould temperature from 30 degrees to 65 degrees C) comparatively to hot cure foams (mould temperature from 30 degrees to 250 degrees C). Another advantage is the high variety of soft materials for low temperature processing moulds. <b>Cold</b> <b>cure</b> foams are diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) based while hot cure foams are toluene diisocyanate (TDI) based. This study is concerned with Viscoelastic flexible foams MDI based for medical applications. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was used to characterize the cure kinetics and Dynamical Mechanical Analisys to collect mechanical data. The data obtained from these two experimental procedures were analyzed and associated to establish processing/properties/operation conditions relationships.

40|$|The {{smoothness}} of acrylic surface {{plays an}} important role in producing removable orthodontic appliances. Int this study, we examine the effect of pressure and polishing technique on surface roughness of <b>cold</b> <b>cured</b> acrylic resin. Forty eight samples were prepared and classified into two groups: acrylic resin polymerization with and without pressure. Each group was classified into four subgroups: being polished with abrasive stone, bur for acrylic, silicone polisher and without being polished as control group. Surface roughness was measured using surface roughness tester. The surface roughness of polymerized acrylic with and without pressure and polished with different technique was analyzed using One-Way ANOVA, continued by Dunnet test. T-test was done to know whether there was the effect of pressure on surface roughness after being polished using certain technique. The result showed that pressure and polishing technique affected surface roughness significantly (p = 0. 001). On the group of polymerization with pressure, surface roughness resulted from polishing with bur of acrylic showed significant difference with silicone polisher, whereas on the group without pressure, polishing with bur of acrylic showed significant difference with abrasive stone. Of the three polishing techniques, there was significant difference of surface roughness of <b>cold</b> <b>cured</b> acrylic resin (t = 0. 002).

40|$|Introduction: Bond Strengths among {{denture base}} resins and {{various types of}} reline {{materials}} are not always satisfactorily high. Therefore efforts {{have been made to}} use materials similar to resin base dentures and bonding agents to increase infirmity. This study compares bond strength and deflection of a hard chair side reline material with two denture base resins. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 54 resin specimens with the size of 65 × 10 × 2. 5 mm were prepared. These specimens included intact heat cure (M), <b>cold</b> <b>cure</b> (F), acrylic resin specimens bonded with the same resins (M-M, F-F) and specimens bonded to a hard chair side reline material (M-G, F-G). All specimens were stored in sodium hypochlorite 8 hours a day for 3 months and were then thermocycled (2000 cycles, 5 to 55 °C). The transverse bond strengths (FMax) and deflections (DFMax) were evaluated with three point loading test. The results were analyzed with two-way ANOVA followed by Games Howell & Gabriel’s and Kolmogrov-smirnor test (α = 0. 05). Results: F Max for different types of resins and reline materials showed significant differences (p value < 0. 05). Although DFMax differences between reline materials and their interactions with different types of resins were significantly different (p value < 0. 05), no significant difference among the types of resins could be found (p value = 0. 263). Comparing the reline materials with denture base resins, <b>cold</b> <b>cure</b> resin was shown to have statistically different FMax and DFMax (p value < 0. 05). Heat cure resins showed statistical differences on FMax between intact resins when relined with the same resins and relined with hard reline (p value < 0. 05). Conclusion: Bond strength of the <b>cold</b> <b>cure</b> denture base resin group (F) to the same resin was higher than hard reline, but bond strength of hard reline material with heat cure denture base was similar to the bond strength of the same reline, and in this group, maximum deflection in bonded resin with the same resins were showed.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} a new approach for denture fabrication process by implementing the techniques used in the advanced manufacturing technology involving Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Rapid Tooling (RT) process. A 3 D-ATOS scanning system was used to obtain the surface data of the edentulous model, occlusion rims of the patient and the teeth set received from the dental clinic. The scanned surface was refined using the Geomagic Studio 10 and then converted to IGES format for CAD application. A SolidWork version 2010 was used for designing reference lines, imaginary plane and setup curves to the 3 D images of the scanned components. This was used as a reference for denture assembly in which, the design were followed to the occlusion and teeth arrangement principles and the data would then be stored in a CAD library for future design. Then maxilla anterior, maxilla posterior and mandible anterior teeth were assembled one by one while mandible posterior teeth were assembled by collision detection. Chewing detection was also conducted to check the contact region between upper and lower teeth by using interference detection technique. Then, new freeform surfaces were created for gingival and base plate. The complete dentures design were converted to STL format for production of master pattern using the Multi Jet Modelling (MJM) machine, one of the rapid prototyping (RP) technique. The pattern was used in the silicon rubber mould for vacuum casting process. <b>Cold</b> <b>cure</b> acrylic resin (VERTEX, Castavaria) was used as the denture material and casted in the silicone mould. Different degassing times were studied to reduce porosity dentures parts. Then, the final dentures were polished and tested on edentulous model to test the bite and adaptability. The finished denture was tested on patient edentulous to ensure the adaptability and comfortability. The result for the denture was found to be satisfactory and has good accuracy.
