5|$|Private {{associations}} and country clubs have no obvious public law function, yet the courts exercise judicial review over their decisions and proceedings, such as hearings relating to disciplinary matters and those held {{to decide if}} persons should be deprived of their memberships in the associations, {{to ensure that they}} are fair and <b>comply</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> of natural justice. It has been suggested that the courts' jurisdiction in such matters depends on contract. The rules of an association form a contract between the members of the association themselves, and the need for hearings to be conducted in accordance with natural justice is an implied term in the contract. Accordingly, the courts are merely enforcing the contract rather than exercising a judicial review function.|$|E

5|$|The western jackdaw {{is one of}} a {{very small}} number of birds that it is legal to use as a decoy or to trap in a cage in the United Kingdom. The other pest species that can be {{controlled}} by trapping are the crow, jay, magpie and rook. An authorised person must <b>comply</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and does not need to show that the birds were a nuisance before trapping them. As of 2003 the western jackdaw was listed as a potential species for targeted hunting in the European Union Birds Directive, and hunting has been encouraged by German hunting associations. Permission to shoot western jackdaws in spring and summer exists in Cyprus as they are thought (incorrectly) to prey on gamebirds.|$|E
5|$|The Government {{sought to}} use the MirageIII {{replacement}} program {{as a means to}} increase the capabilities of Australia's manufacturing industry. Accordingly, it was decided to build the aircraft in Australia, though it was recognised that this would lead to higher costs than if the fighters were purchased directly from the United States. While the first two RAAF Hornets were built in the United States, the remainder were assembled at the Government Aircraft Factories plant at Avalon Airport in Victoria, and their engines were produced by the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation at Fishermans Bend in Melbourne. Another twelve Australian companies were involved in other stages of the project. These firms were sub-contracted to McDonnell Douglas and the other major US companies that produced components for the F/A-18, and had to <b>comply</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> of the FMS program. The Australian Government hoped that Singapore and New Zealand would purchase Australian-built Hornets, but this did not eventuate. The Canadian Government expressed interest in purchasing 25 Australian-built F/A-18As in 1988 in order to increase its force of these aircraft after they had ceased to be manufactured in the United States, but this did not lead to any sales.|$|E

25|$|Section 602 directs each Federal agency {{administering}} {{a program}} of Federal financial assistance by way of grant, contract, or loan to take action pursuant to rule, regulation, or order of general applicability to effectuate the principle of section 601 {{in a manner consistent}} with the achievement of the objectives of the statute authorizing the assistance.

However, each agency is directed first to seek compliance with its requirements by voluntary means.|$|E
25|$|The {{new school}} had {{challenged}} the medical establishment. Jordan's {{aim was to}} reduce the burden of costs that were placed on students who otherwise {{would have to go}} to London if they wanted to obtain a diploma from the Royal College of Surgeons or a licence from the Society of Apothecaries. As a side-effect of this, he thought that student morals would not be subjected to the licentiousness that he perceived to be present in London and that a provincial education would increase the number of doctors practising outside the capital. He arranged that his curriculum would <b>comply</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> of the London institutions and thus it comprised a seven-month course of 140 lectures as well as lessons and demonstrations in dissection. He offered a formal, structured programme of study of a type unavailable outside the capital and the few universities that then existed, and he offered an alternative to the more commonly adopted process of medical learning that involved a long apprenticeship.|$|E

25|$|The era of {{standing}} accommodation at Maine Road {{came to an}} end in May 1994 as the stadium became all-seater to <b>comply</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> of the Taylor Report, with the demolition of the Kippax Street Terrace, which unusually for an all-standing area was located {{at the side of the}} pitch instead of behind the goals. The final match with standing permitted took place on 30 April 1994, against Chelsea for a 2â€“2 draw. Immediately prior to demolition the capacity of the Kippax terrace was 18,300. A three-tier stand was built in its place, holding nearly 14,000 spectators, and on its completion in October 1995 it was the tallest stand in the country, built at a cost of Â£16m in 1994, four times the turnover of the club according to then-chairman Francis Lee. The revamp of the Kippax was the second phase of a five-part development plan that would have cost Â£40m and increased the stadium's capacity to 45,024. However the club abandoned these plans as City were relegated from the Premier League in 1996 and from Division One two years later.|$|E
