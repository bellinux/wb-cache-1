5|$|The {{house sparrow}} {{was among the}} first animals to be given a {{scientific}} name in the modern system of biological classification, since it was described by Carl Linnaeus, in the 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae. It was described from a type specimen collected in Sweden, with the name Fringilla domestica. Later, the genus name Fringilla came to be used only for the common <b>chaffinch</b> and its relatives, and the house sparrow has usually been placed in the genus Passer created by French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760.|$|E
5|$|Many long-distance {{migrants}} {{appear to}} be genetically programmed to respond to changing day length. Species that move short distances, however, may not need such a timing mechanism, instead moving in response to local weather conditions. Thus mountain and moorland breeders, such as wallcreeper Tichodroma muraria and white-throated dipper Cinclus cinclus, may move only altitudinally to escape the cold higher ground. Other species such as merlin Falco columbarius and Eurasian skylark Alauda arvensis move further, to the coast or towards the south. Species like the <b>chaffinch</b> are much less migratory in Britain than those of continental Europe, mostly not moving more than 5km in their lives.|$|E
50|$|Blue <b>chaffinches</b> {{resemble}} common <b>chaffinches,</b> and are {{a smaller}} in size than Tenerife blue <b>chaffinches.</b> Other differences are that they have two white bands in the wings very marked, a whiter belly, or less blue shades.|$|R
50|$|Blue <b>chaffinches</b> {{resemble}} common <b>chaffinches,</b> {{but they}} are noticeably larger, and have a thicker bill. They are characteristically more uniform in their plumage, and they lack a dark cap. Females are a dull grey-brown, but can be distinguished from <b>chaffinches</b> by their weaker wing bars. Breeding males are unmistakable, with the namesake largely blue plumage and a grey bill.|$|R

25|$|The {{eggs and}} nestlings of the <b>chaffinch</b> are predated by crows, red and grey squirrels, {{domestic}} cats and probably also by stoats and weasels. Clutches begun {{later in the}} spring suffer less predation, an effect that {{is believed to be}} due to the increased vegetation making nests more difficult to find. Unlike the case for the closely related brambling, the <b>chaffinch</b> is not parasitised by the common cuckoo.|$|E
25|$|The common <b>chaffinch</b> (Fringilla coelebs), usually known {{simply as}} the <b>chaffinch,</b> is a common and {{widespread}} small passerine bird in the finch family. The male is brightly coloured with a blue-grey cap and rust-red underparts. The female is much duller in colouring, but both sexes have two contrasting white wing bars and white sides to the tail. The male bird has a strong voice and sings from exposed perches to attract a mate.|$|E
25|$|The {{acquisition}} by {{the young}} <b>chaffinch</b> of its song {{was the subject of}} an influential study by British ethologist William Thorpe. Thorpe determined that if the <b>chaffinch</b> is not exposed to the adult male's song during a certain critical period after hatching, it will never properly learn the song. He also found that in adult chaffinches, castration eliminates song, but injection of testosterone induces such birds to sing even in November, when they are normally silent.|$|E
50|$|His {{attempts}} to introduce bullfinches, <b>chaffinches,</b> nightingales, and skylarks were not successful.|$|R
25|$|The protozoal {{parasite}} Trichomonas gallinae {{was known}} to infect pigeons and raptors but beginning in Britain in 2005, carcases of dead European greenfinches and <b>chaffinches</b> {{were found to be}} infected with the parasite. The disease spread and in 2008 infected carcases were found in Norway, Sweden and Finland and a year later in Germany. The spread of the disease {{is believed to have been}} mediated by <b>chaffinches</b> as large numbers of the birds breed in northern Europe and winter in Britain. In Britain the number of infected carcases recovered each year declined after a peak in 2006. There was a reduction in the number of greenfinches but no significant decline in the overall number of <b>chaffinches.</b> A similar pattern occurred in Finland where, after the arrival of the disease in 2008, there was a reduction in the number of greenfinches but only a small change in the number of <b>chaffinches.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Chaffinches</b> {{can develop}} tumors {{on their feet}} and legs caused by the Fringilla coelebs papillomavirus. The size of the papillomas range from a small nodule on a digit to a large growth {{involving}} both the foot and the leg. The disease is uncommon: in a 1973 study undertaken in the Netherlands, of around 25,000 <b>chaffinches</b> screened only 330 bore papillomas.|$|R
25|$|The {{official}} symbols {{from nature}} associated with Tenerife are the bird blue <b>chaffinch</b> (Fringilla teydea) and the Canary Islands dragon tree (Dracaena draco) tree.|$|E
25|$|The Fringillidae are all seed-eaters with stout conical bills. They {{have similar}} skull morphologies, nine large primaries, 12 tail {{feathers}} and no crop. In all species, the female builds the nest, incubates the eggs, and broods the young. Finches {{are divided into}} two subfamilies, the Carduelinae, containing around 28 genera with 141 species and the Fringillinae containing a single genus, Fringilla, with three species: the <b>chaffinch</b> (F. coelebs), the Tenerife blue <b>chaffinch</b> (F. teydea), and the brambling (F. montifringilla). Fringilline finches raise their young almost entirely on arthropods, while the cardueline finches raise their young on regurgitated seeds.|$|E

40|$|Individuals' {{behavioral}} {{responses to}} predator stimuli may be constrained {{due to the}} needs of courtship and reproductive behavior. We tested whether alarm and mobbing behavior in response to predator stimuli was dependent on changes in reproductive behavior in <b>chaffinches</b> (Fringilla coelebs). Male <b>chaffinches</b> may suffer cuckoldry if they become separated from their mates during the fertile period, as would happen in cases of mobbing a predator. After the fertile period has ended, however, as their eggs and subsequent young become increasingly valuable, male <b>chaffinches</b> should devote more effort toward mobbing. We found that the time spent near the female and copulation rates was higher during the preincubation fertile period compared with the incubation period. However, the intensity of mobbing responses to a stuffed avian predator was higher during the incubation period. Furthermore, an experiment that manipulated calling behavior related to mobbing intensity showed that rates of extrapair copulations were higher in treatments of higher intensity mobbing. Taken together, these results indicate that during the breeding season, male <b>chaffinches</b> only engage in antipredator mobbing behavior after the fertile period has ended for their female mate. These data point to an important trade-off between current reproductive effort and antipredator responses. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

Mammals include badger, fox, pine marten, red deer, sika deer, and red squirrel. Insects include many species of the {{parasitic}} gall wasp and the purple hairstreak butterfly, whose caterpillar is entirely dependent upon oak trees.|$|E

25|$|The <b>chaffinch</b> was {{described}} by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the 10th edition of his Systema Naturae under its current binomial name. Fringilla is the Latin word for a finch, while caelebs means unmarried or single. Linnaeus remarked that during the Swedish winter, only the female birds migrated south through Belgium to Italy.|$|E
2500|$|Outside the {{breeding}} season <b>chaffinches</b> mainly eat seeds and other plant material {{that they find}} on the ground. [...] They often forage in open country in large flocks. <b>Chaffinches</b> seldom take food directly from plants and only very rarely use their feet for handling food. During {{the breeding}} season, their diet switches to invertebrates especially defoliating caterpillars. They forage in trees and also occasionally make short sallies to catch insects in the air. The young are entirely fed with invertebrates which include caterpillars, aphids, earwigs, spiders and the larvae of beetles.|$|R
60|$|And {{why should}} there be so many sorts of birds, all robbing the garden at once? Thrushes, and blackbirds, and sparrows, and <b>chaffinches,</b> and greenfinches, and bullfinches, and tomtits.|$|R
40|$|The {{degree to}} which {{foraging}} and vigilance are mutually exclusive is crucial to understanding {{the management of the}} predation and starvation risk trade-off in animals. We tested whether wild-caught captive <b>chaffinches</b> that feed at a higher rate do so at the expense of their speed in responding to a model sparrowhawk flying nearby, and whether consistently good foragers will therefore tend to respond more slowly on average. First, we confirmed that the time taken to respond to the approaching predator depended on the rate of scanning: as head-up rate increased so <b>chaffinches</b> responded more quickly. However, against predictions, as peck rate increased so head-up rate increased and mean length of head-up and head-down periods decreased. Head-up rate was probably dependent on peck rate because almost every time a seed was found, a bird raised its head to handle it. Therefore <b>chaffinches</b> with higher peck rates responded more quickly. Individual <b>chaffinches</b> showed consistent durations of both their head-down and head-up periods and, therefore, individuals that were good foragers were also good detectors of predators. In relation to the broad range of species that have a similar foraging mode to <b>chaffinches,</b> our results have two major implications for predation/starvation risk trade-offs: (i) feeding rate can determine vigilance scanning patterns; and (ii) the best foragers can also be the best at detecting predators. We discuss how our results can be explained in mechanistic terms relating to fundamental differences in how the probabilities of detecting food rather than a predator are affected by time. In addition, our results offer a plausible explanation for the widely observed effect that vigilance continues to decline with group size even when there is no further benefit to reducing vigilance...|$|R

500|$|Some vinkeniers {{claim that}} finches from the {{different}} regions of Belgium sing in different dialects; with birds from the Dutch-speaking Flanders singing [...] "in Dutch" [...] and those from the French-speaking Wallonia singing undesirably [...] "in French". The use of [...] "Dutch" [...] and [...] "Walloon" [...] to describe these two supposed types of finches has been suggested {{to refer to a}} simple difference in calling not literally linked to either the Flemish or Walloon communities of Belgium, and some linguists even suggest that [...] "Walloon" [...] simply means [...] "foreign". While minute regional differences (a.k.a. dialects) in song have been observed in the <b>chaffinch</b> (also within Belgium), the differences have only been reliably distinguishable by the use of sonograms. Taxonomically, there are no officially-recognized subspecies of <b>chaffinch</b> within Belgium.|$|E
500|$|Modern {{animal rights}} activists, {{such as those}} from the Flemish Bird Protection Society, accuse {{trainers}} of [...] "brainwashing" [...] birds into singing more than is natural or healthy by playing looped recordings of finch calls, and that caging birds in the intentionally small and dark contest boxes is cruel. The finch is a popular aviary bird in many countries and it is forbidden in the European Union to catch birds in the wild, despite vinkeniers purporting that wild birds sing better than captive ones. Though <b>chaffinch</b> populations are currently {{not considered to be}} threatened, a 2002 court case at the Belgian Constitutional Court upheld a 1979 EU law banning the capture of wild finches.|$|E
