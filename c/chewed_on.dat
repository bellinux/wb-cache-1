5|$|As {{a result}} of one Macedonian incursion, during which border guards are killed, Dumitriu is ordered to round up and execute {{a number of his}} Bulgarian prisoners. Horrified by this random reprisal, Marie-Thérèse strives to have them pardoned and released, but her plea only serves to irritate her husband's {{superiors}}. Her husband alienates his superiors further when he asks for the execution order to be ratified through official channels, whereas they would prefer an extrajudicial killing. The resulting toll on Dumitriu's career means that they are forced to leave Southern Dobruja, shortly before which the captain's colleagues make public their resentment of the couple. The captain feels dishonored when an angry General Tchilibia draws a comparison between Von Debretsy and the prostitute Erzsi and stresses that, as Hungarians, both women are natural suspects in Romania. It is {{a result of}} this that Dumitriu decides to commit suicide, unable to decide whether to shoot himself in the mouth or in the temple, and ultimately falling of the stool (which his mare had <b>chewed</b> <b>on)</b> and weeping uncontrollably. This episode, Simon points out, was not present in the original text, and was invented by Pintilie to underline the degradation his character undergoes in order to survive. In what is one of the closing scenes, Marie-Thérèse is stoned by those Bulgarian women whose husbands had been executed.|$|E
25|$|Aspect {{is unusual}} in ASL in that {{transitive}} verbs derived for aspect lose their transitivity. That is, while you can sign 'dog chew bone' for the dog <b>chewed</b> <b>on</b> a bone, or 'she look-at me' for she looked at me, you cannot {{do the same in}} the durative to mean the dog gnawed on the bone or she stared at me. Instead, you must use other strategies, such as a topic construction (see below) to avoid having an object for the verb.|$|E
25|$|Another account {{involves}} a 9th-century Ethiopian goat-herder, Kaldi, who, noticing the energizing effects when his flock nibbled {{on the bright}} red berries of a certain bush, <b>chewed</b> <b>on</b> the fruit himself. His exhilaration prompted him to bring the berries to a monk in a nearby monastery. But the monk disapproved of their use and threw them into the fire, from which an enticing aroma billowed, causing other monks to come and investigate. The roasted beans were quickly raked from the embers, ground up, and dissolved in hot water, yielding the world's first cup of coffee. Since this story is not known to have appeared in writing before 1671, 800 {{years after it was}} supposed to have taken place, it is highly likely to be apocryphal.|$|E

25|$|Philodendrons {{can contain}} {{as much as}} 0.7% of oxalates {{in the form of}} calcium oxalate {{crystals}} as raphides. The risk of death, if even possible, is extremely low if ingested by an average adult, although its consumption is generally considered unhealthy. In general, the calcium oxalate crystals have a very mild effect on humans, and large quantities have to be consumed for symptoms to even appear. Possible symptoms include increased salivation, a sensation of burning of the mouth, swelling of the tongue, stomatitis, dysphagia, an inability to speak, and edema. Cases of mild dermatitis due to contact with the leaves have also been reported, with symptoms including vesiculation and erythema. The chemical derivatives of alkenyl resorcinol are believed to be responsible for the dermatitis in some people. Contact with philodendron oils or fluids with the eyes have also been known to result in conjunctivitis. Fatal poisonings are extremely rare; one case of an infant eating small quantities of a philodendron resulting in hospitalization and death has been reported. This one case study, however, was found to be inconsistent with the findings from a second study. In this study, 127 cases of children ingesting philodendrons were studied, and they found only one child showed symptoms; a 10-month-old had minor upper lip swelling when he <b>chewed</b> <b>on</b> a philodendron leaf. The study also found the symptoms could subside without treatment and that previously reported cases of severe complications were exaggerated.|$|E
500|$|According to Rudolf Simek, [...] "the {{squirrel}} {{probably only}} represents an embellishing detail to the mythological {{picture of the}} world-ash in Grímnismál. Hilda Ellis Davidson, describing the world tree, states the squirrel is said to gnaw at it—furthering a continual destruction and re-growth cycle, and posits the tree symbolizes ever-changing existence. John Lindow points out that Yggdrasil is described as rotting {{on one side and}} as being <b>chewed</b> <b>on</b> by four harts and Níðhöggr, and that, according to the account in Gylfaginning, it also bears verbal hostility in the fauna it supports. Lindow adds that [...] "in the sagas, a person who helps stir up or keep feuds alive by ferrying words of malice between the participants is seldom one of high status, which may explain the assignment of this role in the mythology to a relatively insignificant animal".|$|E
500|$|Alf Clausen, who {{has scored}} {{most of the}} Simpsons music, began {{his work on the}} show with this episode. The first segment, [...] "Bad Dream House", was written by John Swartzwelder and {{directed}} by Wes Archer. The voice of the house was provided by cast member Harry Shearer. Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky wrote the second segment, [...] "Hungry are the Damned", and Rich Moore directed it. Sam Simon wrote the third segment, [...] "The Raven", and David Silverman directed it. The segment was based on Edgar Allan Poe's 1845 narrative poem [...] "The Raven". [...] During production, Simpsons creator Matt Groening was nervous about [...] "The Raven" [...] because it did not have many gags, and felt it would be [...] "the worst, most pretentious thing [...] ever done" [...] on the show. American actor James Earl Jones guest starred in the episode as a moving man, Serak the Preparer (one of the aliens) and the narrator of [...] "The Raven". Unable to work {{with the rest of the}} cast, Jones recorded his lines at the Village Recorder in West Los Angeles; he <b>chewed</b> <b>on</b> a cookie close to his microphone to perform drooling sounds for the aliens.|$|E

500|$|Cheetahs {{kill their}} prey by {{tripping}} {{it during the}} chase; the cheetah can use its strong dewclaw to knock the prey off its balance. To kill medium- to large-sized prey, the cheetah bites the prey's throat to suffocate it to death. A bite {{on the back of}} the neck or the snout is enough to kill smaller prey. The prey is then taken to a shaded place; the cheetah, highly exhausted after the chase, rests beside the kill and pants heavily for nearly five to 55 minutes. Groups of cheetah devour the kill peacefully, though minor growling may be observed. Cheetahs not involved in hunting will immediately start eating. Cheetah can consume large quantities of food. In a study at the Etosha National Park (Namibia), the cheetah consumed as much as [...] within two hours and stayed close to the remains for 11hours. Cheetah move their head from side to side so that the sharp carnassial teeth effectively tear the flesh, which can then be swallowed without chewing. They typically begin with the hindquarters, and then progress toward the abdomen and the spine. Rib bones are <b>chewed</b> <b>on</b> at the ends, and the limbs are not generally torn apart while eating.|$|E
2500|$|Cats as yōkai in {{literature}} {{date back to}} the Kamakura period (11851333). In the collection of setsuwa (oral tradition of folktales before the 14th century), the Kokon Chomonjū, from this period, there can be seen statements pointing out cats that do strange and suspicious things, noting that [...] "these are perhaps ones that have turned into demons." [...] Old stories about bakeneko from that time period are often associated with temples, but it is thought that {{the reason for this is}} that when Buddhism came to Japan, in order to protect the sutras (sacred texts) from being <b>chewed</b> <b>on</b> by rats, cats were brought along too.|$|E
2500|$|Commodus {{was also}} known for {{fighting}} exotic animals in the arena, often to {{the horror of the}} Roman people. According to Gibbon, Commodus once killed 100 lions in a single day. Later, he decapitated a running ostrich with a specially designed dart and afterwards carried the bleeding head of the dead bird and his sword over to the section where the Senators sat and gesticulated as though they were next. [...] Dio notes that the targeted senators actually found this more ridiculous than frightening, and <b>chewed</b> <b>on</b> laurel leaves to conceal their laughter. [...] On another occasion, Commodus killed three elephants {{on the floor of the}} arena by himself. Finally, Commodus killed a giraffe, which was considered to be a strange and helpless beast.|$|E

50|$|Dog toys serve {{different}} purposes. Puppies, for instance, need toys {{they can}} <b>chew</b> <b>on</b> {{when they are}} teething because their gums and jaws become very sore and <b>chewing</b> <b>on</b> things provides them relief. Also, playing with different toys encourages exercise, which benefits the pet's overall health. Toys also stimulate dogs' minds, discourage problem behavior resulting from boredom and excess energy, and promote dental health.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{there was}} a debate {{about the effects of}} gum <b>chewing</b> <b>on</b> various aspects of {{cognitive}} functioning. In this review, the results of previous studies are presented and summarized. There is a clear indication that gum chewing can improve various aspects of cognitive functioning including memory, attention and both executive and intellectual functioning. However, there is also clear evidence that chewing gum during cognitive tasks can adversely affect task performance. Therefore, it can be concluded that the replication of (beneficial or detrimental) effects of gum <b>chewing</b> <b>on</b> cognition has been proven to be very difficult. Consequently, the robustness of reported effects of gum <b>chewing</b> <b>on</b> cognition has to be questioned. Suggestions for future research are given...|$|R
