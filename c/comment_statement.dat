40|$|Given a Riemannian {{manifold}} M and a hypersurface H in M, it is {{well known}} that infinitesimal convexity on a neighborhood of a point in H implies local convexity. We show in this note that the same result holds in a semi-Riemannian manifold. We make some remarks for the case when only timelike, null or spacelike geodesics are involved. The notion of geometric convexity is also reviewed and some applications to geodesic connectedness of an open subset of a Lorentzian manifold are given.

40|$|PDS is a {{collection}} of Fortran subroutines for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems using direct search methods. The software is written so that execution on sequential machines is straightforward while execution on Intel distributed memory machines, such as the iPSC/ 2, the iPSC/ 860 or the Touchstone Delta, can be accomplished simply by including a few well-defined routines containing calls to Intel-specific Fortran libraries. Those interested in using the methods on other distributed memory machines, even something as basic as a network of workstations or personal computers, need only modify these few subroutines to handle the global communication requirements. Furthermore, since the parallelism is clearly defined at the "do-loop" level, it is a simple matter to insert compiler directives that allow for execution on shared memory parallel machines.
