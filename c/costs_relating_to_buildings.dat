40|$|Building reuse is a {{linchpin}} {{to managing}} solid waste. Despite the various benefits beyond contributing to sustainability {{that can be}} realized through building reuse, including direct and indirect cost savings, truncated construction schedules, and reduced site disruptions, little formal consideration {{has been given to}} this topic, which places professional engineers at a disadvantage, when considering this as a design option. As each building project has its own specific requirements, reuse is not always the most economical solution, however, in cases where reuse is in part motivated by other factors such as heritage protection, substantial economic and environmental savings can be realized in tandem. Based on nearly two decades of professional experience, a generalized assessment method for reuse is proposed to facilitate benefit maximization. Applying this 10 step method, the <b>costs</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>building</b> replacement and sustainable reuse are compared using two case histories and a theoretical building resulting. A clear correlation is shown as to the potential for savings as a function of project size...|$|R
30|$|We {{have also}} {{investigated}} {{as to what}} the perception of the NGOs on how the environmental protection should go along with the economic development. The results reveal that economic development should come first instead of environmental protection, according to some of the respondents. One of the representatives of the NGOs, for example, explained that it might take a while for the country to drag itself out of poverty if priority is given to environmental protection. The representative has underlined the high <b>cost</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>building</b> a waste treatment plant in an industrial setting. According to the representative, forcing companies to put waste treatment mechanisms in place would discourage them and that eventually impair the economic development of the country.Another representative endorses economic development alongside with environmental protection and the representative has condemned any development that would come in the expense of the natural environment. The representative has put developing the economy and improving the livelihood of the people as the responsibility and the interest of the government. However, the representative regards protecting the natural environment as the interest of the environmental NGOs and said that harmonizing these two interests is the way forward.|$|R

40|$|There {{is general}} {{acceptance}} that PPPs {{are part of}} the procurement landscape in Australia. However, a strong body of opinion exists to support the concerns of the private sector that current social infrastructure projects in Australia are not true partnerships (Curnow et al., 2005; Jefferies and McGeorge, 2009; Jefferies et al., 2013). The public sector needs to make PPPs more attractive to the private sector and clarify the risk identification in order to transfer more responsibility to the private sector. This issue is supported by recent industry criticism of PPPs concerning the 'narrowness' of the scope of work that is offered to the private sector. In reality, PPP project <b>costs</b> <b>relating</b> <b>to</b> finance, <b>building</b> design, construction, maintenance and waste management amount to less than 15 per cent of the total life-cycle cost of the enterprise.

40|$|Based on {{conventional}} static line rating method, the actual current carrying capability of overhead conductors cannot be judged. Due to continuous increment in electricity demand {{and the difficulties}} associated with new line constructions, the overhead lines are therefore required to be rated based on a method that should establish their real-time capability in terms of electricity transmission. The method {{used to determine the}} real-time ampacity of overhead conductors not only can enhance their transmission capacity but can also help in allowing excessive renewable generation in the electricity network. In this research work, the issues <b>related</b> <b>to</b> analyzing an impact of wind power on periodical loading of overhead line as well as finding its static and dynamic ampacities with line current are investigated in detail. Moreover, the investigation <b>related</b> <b>to</b> finding a suitable location {{for the construction of a}} 60 MW wind farm is taken on board. Thereafter, the wind park is integrated with a regional grid, owned by Fortum Distribution AB. In addition to that, the electricity generated from the wind park is also calculated in this project. Later on, the work is devoted to finding the static and dynamic line ratings for “VL 3 ” overhead conductor by using IEEE- 738 - 2006 standard. Furthermore, the project also deals with finding the line current and making its comparison with maximum capacity of overhead conductor (VL 3) for loading it in such a way that no any violation of safe ground clearance requirements is observed at all. Besides, the line current, knowing the conductor temperature when it transmits the required electricity in the presence of wind power generation is also an important factor to be taken into consideration. Therefore, based on real-time ambient conditions with actual line loading and with the help of IEEE- 738 - 2006 standard, the conductor temperature is also calculated in this project. At the end, an economic analysis is performed to evaluate the financial advantages <b>related</b> <b>to</b> applying the dynamic line ratings approach in place of traditional static line ratings technique across an overhead conductor (VL 3) and to know how much beneficial it is to temporarily postpone the rebuilding and/or construction of a new transmission line. Furthermore, an economic analysis <b>related</b> <b>to</b> wind power system is taken into consideration as well to get familiar with the <b>costs</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>building</b> and connecting a 60 MW wind farm with the regional grid.

40|$|Inverted {{files are}} widely used in {{building}} bibliographic {{and other types of}} retrieval systems. In order to investigate the utility of advance information retrieval methods for improving access to large online library catalogs, it was necessary to extend the SMART system in a variety of ways. One particular problem was to develop a fast method to produce an inverted file from hundreds of thousands of (partial) MARC records. The FAST-INV software was developed in 1986, taking advantage of the large primary memories available on modern computers and the order inherent in the input data. Using the new algorithm, processing in primary memory for N basic data elements has time complexity O(N), and processing of files that will not fit in primary memory can be accomplished in a fixed number of passes. Performance studies show this approach to be (at least) an order of magnitude faster than commonly used techniques. It is hoped that these findings will be of interest to database providers and will help them reduce <b>costs</b> <b>relating</b> <b>to</b> the <b>building</b> of inverted files, as we have been doing for the last five years...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Cities are not {{identical}} and evolve over time, and sensing in large scale {{can be used}} to capture these differences. Research in Wireless Sensor Networks has provided several tools, techniques and algorithms {{to solve the problem of}} sensing in restricted scenarios (e. g., factory). However, sensing large scale areas, such as big cities, brings many challenges and incurs high <b>costs</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> system <b>building</b> and management. Thus, sensing those areas becomes more feasible when people collaborate among themselves using their portable devices, and building what has been named participatory sensing systems. This work analyzes an emerging type of network derived from this type of system, the Participatory Sensor Network (PSN), where nodes are autonomous mobile entities and the sensing depends on whether they want to participate in the sensing process. Based on four datasets of participatory sensing systems (27 million of records), we show that this type of network brings many challenges <b>related</b> <b>to</b> structural problems, e. g. instant coverage very limited, and also because of big data issues, which may restrict the use of this emerging type of network.

40|$|The first PSV {{to run on}} LNG as fuel was {{delivered}} to the North Sea in 2003 the offshore sector has since taken delivery of 12 with 4 more to be delivered in 2014 and 2015. The environmental benefits of LNG gas includes reduction of NOx and CO 2, as well as close to complete reduction of SOx and particulate matters from exhaust emissions. A Norwegian fiscal tax on NOx emissions prompted {{the establishment of the}} Business Sector’s NOx fund that in exchange for a minimized tax on NOx, offered financial support to companies that implemented NOx reducing measures. For the Norwegian offshore sectore, this translated to a compensation of 80 % of the additional <b>costs</b> <b>relating</b> <b>to</b> the <b>building</b> of an LNG fueled PSV compared to conventionally diesel driven. This qualitative study conducted semi-structured interviews with representatives from 4 different offshore companies currently operating with LNG fuelled PSVs to determine what the position towards LNG is today.

40|$|Awareness and {{significance}} of sustainable development (SD) has been growing {{around the world for}} the last few decades. Sustainable construction is now considered a way for the construction industry to contribute to this larger effort. It is clear why the construction industry must respond accordingly and focus its attention on developing more sustainable buildings - not least because of its huge size, the vast amount of resources it consumes and its major impact on the built and natural environments. This research work therefore aims to examine the concept of sustainability, investigate the <b>costs</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> producing sustainable <b>buildings</b> and the relationship that exists between these costs. A review of the literature showed that the concept of sustainability is broad but the economic, social and environmental aspects, which are inextricably linked, remain the three fundamental pillars of sustainability. Initial construction cost (IC), cost-in-use (CIU) and carbon cost (CC) were revealed as monetary means of appraising economic and environmental criteria. According to the review, social criteria are drivers: subjective and human factors, which affect the other two factors, directly or indirectly. It is concluded that inverse relationship often exists between IC and CIU but the movement of CC in relation to this is still unknown, being a new concept. Further stage of the research work will explore this grey area and consequently model through quantitative analysis the relationship that exists between IC, CIU and CC...|$|R

Increased value of development {{to the society}} at large will mean {{taking into account the}} holistic benefits that can be accrued over the entire life of an asset. For the government however, investing the limited available resources in a sustainable manner continues to make the headlines. Sustainable development is now considered a way for the construction industry to contribute to this national agenda. This study therefore takes a brief look at the concept of sustainability and investigates the <b>costs</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> producing sustainable <b>buildings</b> through the review of relevant literature. According to the study, to ensure effective use of limited resources and enhance short- and long-terms benefits amidst tight budgets, the industry must respond accordingly and focus its attention on developing projects which are economically viable, socially acceptable and environmentally friendly. The monetary measures {{that could be used to}} quantify economic, social and environmental criteria which are the three fundamental pillars of a sustainable development were revealed. They include the initial construction cost (IC) for measuring economic factors, and cost-in-use (CIU) and initial carbon cost (ICC) for measuring social and environmental aspects. The next stage of this research work will be the development of an optimum balance index (OBI), a tool that serves as a single sustainability indicator and which can be used to improve project delivery for the benefits of the society at large.

40|$|Energy {{consumption}} in the building sector account for 40 % of the total energy use in Norway. One of the actions to lower the sectors impact on the climate change {{is to improve the}} energy efficiency in buildings and increase the use of renewable energy sources. Political incentives are taken to obtain a considerable reduction of CO 2 -emissions. From 2020, all new buildings should be nearly zero energy <b>buildings</b> (nZEB), pursuant <b>to</b> the directive on Energy Performance of Buildings. With a higher focus on the environmental impacts from products and processes, the demand for including sustainability analyses in the decision context under the construction planning increases. By taking advantage of life cycle analyses (LCA), the energy use and environmental impact connected to the different life stages of a building can be calculated. In this case-study, the sustainability performance of a nearly zero emission building has been investigated. The owner is the Norwegian Defence Estates Agency, {{which is one of the}} main stakeholders in the construction sector in Norway. Due to their position, they want to investigate the value of constructing low-energy <b>buildings</b> compared <b>to</b> standard <b>buildings.</b> Five sustainability performance analyses of the office with different material solutions have been conducted in SimaPro. The performance of the building is computed for: 	Alternative 1 :as built (with low-CO 2 emission concrete). 	Alternative 2 : as built, but with normal concrete. 	Alternative 3 : as built, but with timber bearing structures. 	Alternative 4 : as built, but timber bearing structures, timber façade and wooden windows. 	Alternative 5 : as built and with PV panels attached to the façade facing south The analyses include the following life cycle phases: construction, use phase, transport and replacements. Through LCA certain chosen environmental indicators were quantified, i. e. Global Warming Potential (GWP), Cumulative Energy Demand (CED) and Net Present Costs (NPC). Through life cycle costing (LCC) methodology, the life cycle <b>costs</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the different <b>building</b> alternatives have been calculated. For the performed analyses, the results reveal that the main differences between the alternatives are found in the GWP. Some alternatives had less CED than the others, but no big savings were found when comparing the NPC. Alternative 4 performed best in terms of GWP with an annual emissions of 7. 5 kg CO 2 eq. per m 2. Alternative 5 used had the lowest CED, 56 kWh/ m 2 yr.

40|$|Shortage of {{drinking}} water {{in most parts of}} the world has been a growing concern in recent times. The situation has been getting worse in underdeveloped and developing countries due to sudden explosion in population growth and the growth in the industries. The natural resources for potable water are limited and unless a feasible solution is obtained in the near future, the ‘concern situation’ may turn into a ‘panic situation’. A possible solution for the shortage in drinking water is to use water from inexhaustible sources such as oceans and seas and make it potable using desalination process. However, the process of desalination is an energy intensive process which the poor countries can not afford. In recent times, the cost of fossil fuels has been skyrocketing. With the crude oil costing more than Rs. 5200 (US$ 120) a barrel as on September 2008, even the rich countries like USA and the countries in the European Union are feeling the pinch of the energy cost. Alternate energy sources such as solar, wind, geo-thermal, hydrogen etc., have become the order of the day. These sources are renewable and are environmental friendly. More than one third of the populations of the world live in coastal areas. These areas get abundant amount of solar energy throughout the year. Utilization of this energy in desalination process would solve drinking water problem to a very great extent. However, construction of centralized desalination plants requires large amount of capital which the poor countries can ill-afford. An alternate solution would be to construct decentralized smaller plants that would require smaller capital to construct and easier to maintain. If the energy requirement is tapped from renewable sources such as solar, then the operational cost also becomes affordable for the poor countries. By taking care of the water requirement of the coastal areas through this process, one may save large amounts of money in transporting potable water from interior areas to the coastal areas. There would be enough water for the people living in the interior areas. The water bed level in the interior areas would gradually increase, thereby reducing the drinking water concerns significantly. In this thesis, a small scale stand alone power generation system for the desalination process is proposed that is suitable to provide clean potable water from sources such as sea water or brackish water. Solar energy is proposed as a source of energy for the proposed desalination system. This source is available in plenty in arid and semi-arid areas. It is free and is also friendlier to the environment. It is proposed to use solar energy in thermal form to obtain energy equivalent of ‘latent heat of vaporization’ for the vaporization process and in electrical form for operating the dc machines and electronic control units that are integral parts of the desalination system. The proposed desalination unit can be built as small as possible even to feed a single household’s requirement and hence can be conceptualized as decentralized units. These units would require considerably less capital to build, and would require minimum maintenance. The desalination process is based on flash evaporation wherein a heated liquid is subjected to a pressure reduction by passing through a throttling device resulting in an initially superheated state. In the proposed desalination process, the traditional flash evaporator is extended to include continuous dynamic pressure modulation to obtain an optimal flow rate for a specified energy input. The cost function or the performance index for optimization is defined as the ratio of flow rate to the energy spent. The optimal flow rate occurs at a specific chamber pressure for a given inlet water temperature. By operating at optimal pressure, significant energy is saved for a specific flow rate. This principle is validated experimentally and the results are presented and discussed in the thesis. This proposed scheme along with hybrid energy input will prove to be an attractive solution for community drinking water problem. A system needs to have a mathematical representation in order to predict the dynamic behavior of the system. This thesis proposes the bond graph method of modeling the physical system wherein the energy flow across the electrical, thermal and the hydraulic domains are included. A system may comprise of several subsystems and the energy flow in each subsystem may be in a different domain. A desalination system is such a system wherein the energy flow in subsystems is in different domains such as electrical, thermal and hydraulics. The bond graph approach is best suited for modeling of such systems where the power/energy flow across domains can be easily and seamlessly integrated. The thesis proposes a fifth order dynamic model of a single stage flash evaporation with pressure modulation using the bond graph approach. The proposed model incorporates the effects of chamber pressure variation, the entropy flow from the chamber due to conduction, convection, radiation and also the thermal dynamics of the water bodies in the evaporation, condensation and collection chambers. The proposed model is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink environment. The simulation results are compared with the experimental results to validate the model. This proposed model can be used for both analysis and synthesis of a desalination system. The desalination system is a complex system wherein multiple energy domains are involved. The thesis presents a systematic process for the design of the desalination system. Design of the desalination system involves design of multi domain subsystems. The design becomes much more complex if the energy source to run the system is solar/ hybrid solar based. The energy budget has to be carefully evaluated considering the worst case conditions for the availability of solar energy. Hence, the information on the quantum of solar energy available at any location is a critical parameter needed for design of the desalination system. A generic method of developing a solar insolation model for a specific region such as the Indian sub-continent is proposed in this thesis along with the validation of the model by comparing measured value with the values that are obtained from the model. As the insolation model is dependent on the water vapor content in the vertical column at the location, the methodology is further applied to develop a model for estimating the precipitated water vapor content in a vertical column for any location. The model is validated by comparing the computed values to the measured values. The thesis further presents the design and selection of the balance of the system. The selection of the balance of the system includes sizing of solar thermal plate collectors such as flat plate for pre-heating and paraboloid for vaporization, solar PV panels for operating pumps, actuator and control units, and battery for backup source for night loads and during ‘no-sun days’, criteria of selecting centrifugal pump for circulating condensation water, vacuum pump for dynamic pressure modulation and selecting linear actuator for Sun tracking of the paraboloid concentrator. A discussion on the electronic circuits used in the control scheme is presented in this thesis. This includes the circuit for maximum power point tracking, circuit for DC-DC conversion, circuit for pressure modulation, circuit for speed control of linear actuator, and finally the circuit for water level limiter. A discussion on the life cycle costing is also presented in this thesis. This is an important parameter that refers to the accumulated worth of all the <b>costs</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>building</b> and operating the desalination plant during its life span. It is emphasized that the objective of the design process is to minimize the life cycle cost while meeting other performance requirements. Thus, life cycle costing is an essential part of the design cycle. The design methodology and the approach used to design the desalination system are implemented in the form of a toolbox in the MATLAB environment. The various functions of the toolbox are highlighted by a detailed step by step presentation of the design modules in the thesis. The modules form the components of the design toolbox for designing the proposed desalination system...|$|R
