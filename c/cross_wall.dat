5|$|Diarist Samuel Pepys {{commented on}} the {{condition}} of Rochester Castle, and as early as the 17thcentury the castle may have acted as a tourist attraction. By this time many castles were in a state of ruin, and Rochester was amongst those in need of repair, although still in use. In 1610 JamesI granted Sir Anthony Weldon control of the castle. During the English Civil War, Weldon declared for the Parliamentarian cause. The castle did not see fighting during the war, even though the city was captured by Royalists in 1648; this may indicate that the castle was not a serviceable fortification by this point. Weldon's support for the Parliamentarians may have spared the castle from slighting (demolition) in the aftermath, a fate shared by many other castles. Walker Weldon inherited the castle and carried out the destruction of part of the outer wall in the 18thcentury to sell off the building material; he had originally intended to dismantle more of the castle, but the plans were abandoned. A drawing from around this time suggests that the <b>cross</b> <b>wall</b> had been removed by this point. While other parts of the castle were dismantled, the two towers in the south-east wall were still being used for accommodation. In 1743 prisoners were held at the castle, probably in huts. Rochester Castle descended through the Weldon family until it was bequeathed to Thomas Blechynden in the 18thcentury. By 1774 Robert Child was in possession of the castle, and it remained in the possession of his family until 1884. There were unsuccessful plans in 1780 to reuse Rochester Castle as an army barracks, after the commander of the Royal Engineers for Chatham, Colonel Hugh Debbieg, asked the Child family for permission. The castle ruins inspired a painting by artist J. M. W. Turner in the late 18thcentury, one of his first oil paintings. Turner was renowned for his love of nature and was {{at the forefront of the}} picturesque movement, during which such ruins became fashionable.|$|E

500|$|The stone-built keeps of the 11thcentury {{generally}} had simple plans, {{with few}} rooms and an uncomplicated layout. Rochester's keep bears testament to a developing complexity, and provides an early {{example of a}} keep divided into separate areas for the lord and his retinue. The thickness of the walls allowed rooms to be built into them, as {{can also be seen}} at the Hedingham Castle's contemporaneous keep, or the slightly later one at Dover. The keep's interior is divided for its entire height by a <b>cross</b> <b>wall</b> running east–west. The ground floor was used for storage, with the three storeys above providing accommodation. The first floor probably contained a hall and great chamber, divided by the <b>cross</b> <b>wall.</b> This level may have been the accommodation of the castle's constable who looked after it during the owner's absence. There is a room called [...] "Gundulf's Chamber" [...] built into the thickness of the wall in the north-west corner; it may well have been the constable's private chamber. The second floor contained the keep's best accommodation and some of its most elaborate decoration. It is [...] high and surrounded by a gallery in its upper half built into the thickness of the walls. The floor also had a chapel measuring about [...] At some unknown point in the post-medieval period, a fire gutted the keep, leaving it in its present state without floors or a roof. On the second floor, there are openings in the <b>cross</b> <b>wall,</b> broken by a series of Romanesque columns between round-headed arches. The <b>cross</b> <b>wall</b> carried a well shaft, with a well-head at each floor. The third floor had a second chapel and access to the roof, and may have held additional accommodation.|$|E

30|$|Floor-plans {{are used}} in many {{applications}} in a rather simple way. In [11, 22], the particles are weighted by zero when the path is <b>crossing</b> a <b>wall.</b> With this, particles that are <b>crossing</b> <b>walls</b> are eliminated. In [9], similar values were used for weighting regarding the floor-plans: a probability of zero (actually a very small value to allow {{a small fraction of}} particles to <b>cross</b> <b>walls</b> in the case of very inaccurate measurements or particle depletion) is applied when a particle's displacement <b>crosses</b> a <b>wall.</b> Otherwise, particles are weighted solely by the product of the likelihoods of other sensors and by a very simple motion model that might reward slower speeds or smaller angular changes (the weighting from the floor-plan is thus effectively very close to unity for all particles not <b>crossing</b> <b>walls).</b>|$|R
40|$|To {{prevent the}} {{adjacent}} structures from damage, some auxiliary methods {{were used to}} control the ground movements induced by deep excavation. <b>Cross</b> <b>walls</b> and buttress walls are common construction methods used in Taiwan for protection of adjacent buildings during excavation. It is generally recognized, but not verified, that both methods have good effects in reducing wall movement and ground settlement. However, the design methodologies for <b>cross</b> <b>walls</b> and buttress walls in excavations are still highly empirical {{because of lack of}} behavior research. The present analysis and the design method are all pause at the experience stage. Therefore, the related <b>cross</b> <b>walls</b> and buttress walls behavior urgently awaits the further research. As this result, a series of behaviors, cases study, and parameter analysis of <b>cross</b> <b>walls</b> and buttress walls are then studied using the numerical analysis method in this study. According to the analysis results, the best design proposal will be put forward. And the simplification empirical design graph will be proposed also. In addition, this study will recommend the simplification analysis methods that coordinate the theory of elasto-plastic single beam model and plane strain numerical analysis. Finally, the stability of excavation increased by <b>cross</b> <b>walls</b> and buttress walls will be investigated.

60|$|The valley Smoke was {{descending}} gradually widened {{after the}} fashion of any normal valley; but, at the lower end, it pinched narrowly between high precipitous walls and abruptly stopped in a <b>cross</b> <b>wall.</b> At the base of this, in a welter of broken rock, the streamlet disappeared, evidently finding its way out underground. Climbing the <b>cross</b> <b>wall,</b> from the top Smoke saw the lake beneath him. Unlike any mountain lake he had ever seen, it was not blue. Instead, its intense peacock-green tokened its shallowness. It was this shallowness that made its draining feasible. All about arose jumbled mountains, with ice-scarred peaks and crags, grotesquely shaped and grouped. All was topsyturvy and unsystematic--a Dore nightmare. So fantastic and impossible was it that it affected Smoke as more like a cosmic landscape-joke than a rational portion of earth's surface. There were many glaciers in the canyons, most of them tiny, and, as he looked, {{one of the larger}} ones, on the north shore, calved amid thunders and splashings. Across the lake, seemingly not more than half a mile, but, as he well knew, five miles away, he could see the bunch of spruce-trees and the cabin. He looked again to make sure, and saw smoke clearly rising from the chimney. Somebody else had surprised themselves into finding Surprise Lake, was his conclusion, as he turned to climb the southern wall.|$|E

30|$|To {{illustrate}} this, let us assume that--at {{the beginning}} of our LPF estimation--particles were distributed equally inside and outside a building since the starting position of the pedestrian is known with only a very large uncertainty. In addition, we assume that the area outside the building is an open area where the pedestrian can walk everywhere. First, we investigate the traditional case of using only floor-plans for weighting (no proper transition model): particles that are inside the building will obtain high (unity) weights if they do not <b>cross</b> <b>walls.</b> Particles outside the building will never obtain a very low or zero weight since they never <b>cross</b> <b>walls.</b> For the case where the tracked pedestrian is inside the building, {{a significant portion of the}} group of particles inside the building will <b>cross</b> <b>walls</b> and as time elapses will be eliminated more and more as a result of the resampling step. On the other hand, all the particles outside the building will have high weights since they are not <b>crossing</b> <b>walls</b> at all. Resampling will result in increasing the number of particles outside the building and decreasing the number of particles inside the building. This will result in divergence of the algorithm over time. Even without resampling and a very large number of particles, the posterior distribution will tend toward the outside group, since the density of particles will be much higher outside.|$|R
50|$|Phytophthora cactorum is a {{homothallic}} (only {{having one}} mating type, can mate with itself) oomycete, and displays the right angled mycelial branching with a constriction {{at the base}} of the branch, which is highly characteristic of other Phytophthora genera. Within the hyphae, they have singular diploid nuclei that are regularly spaced. In addition, young hyphae only have <b>cross</b> <b>walls</b> separating reproductive parts; however older hyphae may have <b>cross</b> <b>walls</b> anywhere. Furthermore, although the hyphae are not the main survival unit of P. cactorum, as long as they are not completely desiccated, they are capable of surviving until just above freezing temperatures.|$|R

40|$|Molecular clock {{analyses}} {{estimate that}} crown-group animals began diversifying {{hundreds of millions}} of years {{before the start of the}} Cambrian period. However, the fossil record has not yielded unequivocal evidence for animals during this interval. Some of the most promising candidates for Precambrian animals occur in the Weng'an biota of South China, including a suite of tubular fossils assigned to Sinocyclocyclicus, Ramitubus, Crassitubus and Quadratitubus, that have been interpreted as soft-bodied eumetazoans comparable to tabulate corals. Here, we present new insights into the anatomy, original composition and phylogenetic affinities of these taxa based on data from synchrotron radiation X-ray tomographic microscopy, ptychographic nanotomography, scanning electron microscopy and electron probe microanalysis. The patterns of deformation observed suggest that the <b>cross</b> <b>walls</b> of Sinocyclocyclicus and Quadratitubus were more rigid than those of Ramitubus and Crassitubus. Ramitubus and Crassitubus specimens preserve enigmatic cellular clusters at terminal positions in the tubes. Specimens of Sinocyclocyclicus and Ramitubus have biological features that might be cellular tissue or subcellular structures filling the spaces between the <b>cross</b> <b>walls.</b> These observations are incompatible with a cnidarian interpretation, in which the spaces between <b>cross</b> <b>walls</b> are abandoned parts of the former living positions of the polyp.
