A formal security analysis in the model of Bellare and Rogaway is provided to justify the relevant security properties and thus to enforce trustworthiness. The basic intuition is that key agreement in open-air-networks should provide forward secrecy, since eavesdropping is essentially for free and hence may give the adversary a small but significant advantage. For this reason, the protocol uses basic Diffie-Hellmann key exchange.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we focus}} on radio {{frequency}} identification (RFID) tag. We design, implement, and evaluate hardware performance of a secure tag that runs the authentication protocol based on cryptographic algorithms. The cryptographic algorithm and the pseudorandom number generator are required to be implemented in the tag. To realize the secure tag, we tackle the following four steps: (A) decision of hardware architecture for the authentication protocol, (B) selection of the cryptographic algorithm, (C) establishment of a pseudorandom number generating method, and (D) implementation and performance evaluation of a silicon chip on an RFID system. (A) The cryptographic algorithm and the pseudorandom number generator are repeatedly called for each authentication. Therefore, {{the impact of the}} time needed for the cryptographic processes on the hardware performance of the tag can be large. While low-area requirements have been mainly discussed in the previous studies, it is needed to discuss the hardware architecture for the authentication protocol from the viewpoint of the operating time. In this thesis, in order to decide the hardware architecture, we evaluate hardware performance {{in the sense of the}} operating time. As a result, the parallel architecture is suitable for hash functions that are widely used for tag authentication protocols. (B) A lot of cryptographic algorithms have been developed and hardware performance of the algorithms have been evaluated on different conditions. However, as the evaluation results depend on the conditions, it is hard to compare the previous results. In addition, the interface of the cryptographic circuits has not been paid attention. In this thesis, in order to select a cryptographic algorithm, we design the interface of the cryptographic circuits to meet with the tag, and evaluate hardware performance of the circuits on the same condition. As a result, the lightweight hash function SPONGENT- 160 achieves well-balanced hardware performance. (C) Implementation of a pseudorandom number generator based on the performance evaluation results on (B) can be a method to generate pseudorandom number on the tag. On the other hand, as the cryptographic algorithm and the pseudorandom number generator are not used simultaneously on the authentication protocol. Therefore, if the cryptographic circuit could be used for pseudorandom number generation, the hardware resource on the tag can be exploited efficiently. In this thesis, we propose a pseudorandom number generating method using a hash function that is a <b>cryptographic</b> <b>component</b> of the authentication protocol. Through the evaluation of our proposed method, we establish a lightweight pseudorandom number generating method for the tag. (D) Tag authentication protocols using a cryptographic algorithm have been developed in the previous studies. However, hardware implementation and performance evaluation of a tag, which runs authentication processes, have not been studied. In this thesis, we design and do a single chip implementation of an analog front-end block and a digital processing block including the results on (A), (B), and (C). Then, we evaluate hardware performance of the tag. As a result, we show that a tag, which runs the authentication protocol based on cryptographic algorithms, is feasible. 電気通信大学 201...|$|E

Nevertheless, recent efforts showed that they are likely more leaky than other elementary components (e. g. block ciphers) in unprotected implementations of these primitives, {{in the context of}} side-channel attacks. In this context, from the adversary’s point of view, the extractors themselves could become the point of interest. This paper extends the problem of how leakage resilience of random extractors could be to the case of protected instantiations. Specifically, we investigate the feasibility of applying classical countermeasures to ameliorate leakage resilience of <b>cryptographic</b> <b>components</b> and/or primitives against side-channel attacks, and then show how to evaluate the physical leakage resilience of these instantiations theoretically and practically.

40|$|Due to {{convenience}} and efficiency, electronic voting (e-voting) techniques gradually replace traditional paper-based voting activities in some developed countries. A secure anonymous e-voting {{system has to}} satisfy many properties, such as completeness, tally correctness, and uncoercibility, where the uncoercibility property {{is the most difficult}} one to be achieved. Since each voter can obtain a voting receipt in an electronic voting system, coercibility and bribe (vote-buying and vote-selling are included) become more and more serious in electronic voting environments than traditional paper-based voting environments.

It will make uncoercible e-voting systems unacceptable by the people. In order to cope with the drawbacks of the previous schemes, this paper will present a generic idea, which is independent of the underlying <b>cryptographic</b> <b>components,</b> on electronic voting to achieve the uncoercibility property and other requirements.

40|$|Cooperative {{networks}} rely on user cooperation at {{the network}} layer to provide services, such as packet forwarding or shared access to other network resources like storage or Internet access. Examples of cooperative networks that build upon user contribution are ad-hoc networks, decentralized wireless mesh networks, micro-operator networks, wireless Internet access sharing networks or hybrids between these network types. However, while it enables new types of networks and services, the concept of cooperative network service provisioning also creates new attack possibilities for malicious and selfish users. For example, wireless multi-hop networks are particularly susceptible to attacks based on flooding and the interception of, tampering with, and forging of packets. Thus, reliable communication in such networks quintessentially depends on mechanisms to allow on-path devices, such as middleboxes, to verify the authenticity of network traffic and {{the identity of the}} communicating peers. Efficient standard authentication techniques for end-to-middle authentication typically assume the presence of shared keys within the network or rely on trusted third parties, such as online authentication servers. However, in cooperative scenarios, these approaches suffer from significant drawbacks in respect to functionality and efficiency. Moreover, the tight resource constraints of wireless routers and access points in cooperative scenarios make the use of more flexible but less efficient authentication techniques challenging. Hence, a careful selection of <b>cryptographic</b> <b>components</b> and the creation of new and flexible and efficient mechanisms is required to enable end-to-middle authentication in cooperative multi-hop networks. In this thesis, we address the problem of end-to-middle authentication on different levels of granularity, ranging from infrequent signaling events to rapid verification of high-bandwidth payload streams. The different security and performance requirements of signaling and payload traffic prevent the creation of a one-size-fits-all solution but requires the use of specialized approaches. We designed and analyzed three solutions that cover low-frequency signaling events as well as high-frequency payload protection. We first analyze and extend the Host Identity Protocol to enable secure public-key based end- to-middle authentication for signaling traffic. However, the use of CPU-intensive public-key verification prevents the use of this solution for verifying high-bandwidth payload streams. Consequently, our second solution focuses on more lightweight <b>cryptographic</b> <b>components</b> to provide end-to-middle authentication for payload. The Adaptive and Lightweight Protocol for Hop-By-hop Authentication, ALPHA, uses efficient hash functions and hash chains to enable rapid verification of the source and integrity of a payload packet. Finally, our third solution sacrifices end-to-middle integrity protection of the packet to further improve the verification performance. The family of Stream-based Per-packet One-time Token Schemes, SPOTS enables middleboxes to rapidly authenticate the source of a packet when the middlebox is agnostic to the contents of the forwarded packet. In combination, the three solution provide a flexible set of mechanisms that enables efficient end-to-middle authentication {{for a wide range of}} scenarios within and beyond the setting of cooperative multi-hop networks...|$|R

It will have an enormous impact on the election process making it fast, reliable and inexpensive. Nonetheless, so far remote voting is considered to be very difficult, as one has to take into account susceptibility of the voter's PC to various cyber-attacks. As a result, most the research effort is put into developing protocols and machines for poll-site electronic voting. Although these solutions yield promising results, they cannot be directly adopted to Internet voting because of secure platform problem. However, the <b>cryptographic</b> <b>components</b> they utilize may be very useful. This paper presents a scheme based on combination of mixnets and homomorphic encryption borrowed from robust poll-site voting, along with techniques recommended for remote voting [...] code sheets and test ballots. The protocol tries to minimize the trust put in voter's PC by making the voter responsible for manual encryption of his vote. To achieve this, the voter obtains a paper ballot that allows him to scramble the vote by performing simple operations (lookup in a table). Creation of paper ballots, as well as decryption of votes, is performed by a group of cooperating trusted servers. As a result, the scheme is characterized by strong asymmetry [...] all computations are carried out on the server side. In consequence it does not require any additional hardware on the voter's side, and offers distributed trust, receipt-freeness and verifiability...|$|R
40|$|TLS is the {{protocol}} {{of choice for}} securing today's e-commerce and online transactions, but adding TLS to a web server imposes a significant overhead relative to an insecure web server on the same platform. We perform a comprehensive study of the performance costs of TLS. Our methodology is to profile TLS web servers with trace-driven workloads, replace individual components inside TLS with no-ops and measure the observed increase in server throughput. We estimate the relative costs of each TLS processing stage, identifying the areas for which future optimizations would be worthwhile. Our results show that while the RSA operations represent the largest performance cost in TLS web servers, they do not solely account for TLS overhead. RSA accelerators are effective for e-commerce site workloads since they experience low TLS session reuse. Accelerators appear to be less effective for sites at which all requests are handled by a TLS server, {{because they have a}} higher session reuse rate. In this case investing in a faster CPU might provide a greater boost in performance. Our experiments show that having a second CPU is at least as useful as an RSA accelerator. As CPUs become more powerful, the relative cost of the <b>cryptographic</b> <b>components</b> of TLS is decreasing; faster CPUs will eventually bridge the performance gap between TLS-secured and insecure web servers. Our results suggest that long-term research efforts should consequently focus on designing more efficient web servers...|$|R
