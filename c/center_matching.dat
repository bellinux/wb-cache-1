40|$|The moto of this {{research}} paper is to design and simulation of a fully automated and high speed assembly system design for self-centering release bearing, which can reduce human efforts, time consumption and eventually cost of a final product. This system increases efficiency and production rate on an assembly line. This system has been designed by using PTC Creo 2. 0 a modelling software. For the gripping purpose a self-centering gripper is used, which is designed {{in such a way}} that it holds the bearing hub with <b>center</b> <b>matching</b> technology and assemble it over self-centering release bearing within the exact tolerance zone. To control all motions of the grippers and the <b>center</b> <b>matching</b> tools the rod less pneumatic cylinders are used. At the end, the computer aided structural analysis and validation of the bearing hub and the gripper have been performed using ANSYS Workbench 16. 0 to study the stresses developed and deformation pattern during the process of assembly...|$|E
40|$|Road {{tracking}} {{based on}} template matching is one class of practical methods of road extraction. However, the conventional methods of template matching mainly utilize correlation coefficient as the similarity measure. As a result, these algorithms {{are sensitive to}} occlusions caused by vehicles and trees and are unsuitable for road extraction from high-resolution remotely sensed imagery. To address this problem, this paper designs a road <b>center</b> <b>matching</b> algorithm based on mean shift utilizing a robust similarity measure, which overcomes the sensitivity of correlation coefficient matching to occlusions; then Kalman filter is utilized to track road centerlines from high-resolution remotely sensed imagery. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can extract road centerlines from high-resolution remotely sensed imagery accurately and is robust to occlusions caused by vehicles and trees...|$|E

30|$|The {{present study}} {{included}} patients treated for ARDS {{in a single}} <b>center.</b> <b>Matching</b> for standard parameters and severity of illness identified an appropriate control group. ARDS patients {{in this study were}} characterized by relatively severe medical conditions, as reflected by high median APACHE II and SAPS II scores at hospital admission. On average, severity scores were higher than in comparable recent studies [13] and even higher than in the ALIVE study [14]. Also, parameters of pulmonary gas exchange and invasiveness of mechanical ventilation indicated severe lung failure. This might be due to our study population, which consisted of very severely affected patients admitted to our ARDS center specifically because their medical condition is poor. On average, more than two-thirds of our patients are transferred from other hospitals [15].|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{physical}} {{properties of the}} most promising color center candidates for the recently observed single-photon emissions in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) with group theory analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Through our study we provide several pieces of evidence that the electronic properties of the color <b>centers</b> <b>match</b> the characters of the experimentally observed emitters. We calculate the symmetry-adapted multi-electron wavefunctions of the defects using group theory methods. The spin-orbit and spin-spin interactions are analyzed in detail. We also identify the radiative and non-radiative transition channels for each color center. Then the profile of excitation and emission dipole polarizations are discussed. The ab initio DFT computed zero-phonon-line emission energies for the defects match well with the observed emission lines. By providing evidences on the relation of single-photon emitters and local defects in h-BN, this work paves the way for harnessing quantum dynamics of the color centers.

40|$|Following from an {{ecological}} conception of environment-behavior relations, {{this study investigated}} the effects of three levels of the spatial definition of behavior settings [...] from well-defined to poorly defined [...] on children's ocial and cognitive behavior. The study used a quasi-experimental post-test-only control group design with multiple levels of treatment and proxy pretest measures. Systematic naturalistic observation was conducted of children and staff at 14 child care <b>centers</b> <b>matched</b> in three groups. The data were analysed by analysis of covariance controlling for subject group differences between settings remaining after the matching. The degree of spatial definition of behavior settings {{was found to be}} predictive of a range of behaviors. Significantly more exploratory behavior, social interaction and coopera-tion occurred in spatially well defined behavior settings than in moderately orpoorly defined settings. Strong interactions were noted between teacher styles and spatial definition in affecting children's behavior. The conclusions emphasize the finding that the effects of physical environmental variables can only be understood when studied in interaction with social environmental variables. The results are supportive of a group x settings interactional theory of environment-behavior relations...|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} constructions of strong desingularization {{but all of}} them give {{essentially}} the same result. In every case the global object (the variety to be desingularized) is replaced by local data (the ideal sheaf of the variety and those of the exceptional divisors and some orders that represents how much should be resolved the ideal in that step). With this local data the centers of blowing-up are defined. The centers will be defined locally and therefore it is a problem to guarantee that they will match up into a global center. This can be done by defining what blowings-up are allowed to resolve each ideal. Done appropriately, this will make the <b>centers</b> <b>match</b> automatically. Another way is to define a local invariant depending on the variety and the history of the resolution (the previous local centers) so that the centers consist of the maximum locus of the invariant. The definition of this is made such that making this choice is meaningful, giving smooth centers transversal to the exceptional divisors.|$|R

40|$|Resonant {{tunneling}} through double-barrier structures (DBs) {{make these}} systems very promising candidates {{for a new}} generation of ultra-high speed electronic devices. For instance, a GaAs-GaAlAs DBs operating at THz frequencies has been reported in the literature [1]. The basic reason for RT to arise in DBs is a quantum phenomenon whose fundamental characteristics are by now well understood: There exists a dramatic increase of the electron transmission whenever the energy of the incident electron is close to one of the unoccupied quasi-bound-states inside the well [2]. In practice, a bias voltage is applied to shift the energy of this quasi-bound-state of nonzero width so that its <b>center</b> <b>matches</b> the Fermi level. Consequently, the characteristics present negative differential resistance when the quasi-bound-state lies well below the Fermi level. In actual samples, however, the situation is much more complex than this simple picture. Scattering by phonons, electrons or defects reduces the required quantum coherence and, in fact, deviations from the above simple description are observed, and the decrease of electron mobility due to rough surfaces even in good-quality heterostructures [3]. We present a novel two-dimensional model to calculate vertical transport properties such a...|$|R
