Today there are thousands of Whizard trimmers in use throughout the world, and the company, today named Bettcher Industries, Inc., is a leading worldwide manufacturer of precision cutting and trimming tools for the meat processing industry and industrial applications.|$|R

For certain applications, introduction is performed directly into the aorta via an open thorax procedure. A prototype of a vascular access device has been realized that allows direct access into the aorta as an alternative for the common surgical graft anastomosis suturing technique. The device consists of a metal tube acting as a <b>circular</b> <b>knife</b> to cut a hole in the aortic wall, a screw to store the removed part of the aortic wall, and a plastic tube that is introduced through the hole and tightly connected to the aortic wall. The device could be placed without aortic clamping. The device has been tested on a slaughterhouse porcine aorta. A low-pressurized aorta appeared to be the worst case; thus, two animal experiments in the low-pressurized pulmonary artery were performed. No leakage occurred for pressures between 40 and 300 mm Hg...|$|R

The surface-sample loader and pyrolyzer assembly (SSPLA) is described, along with the major problems encountered during design and testing. Three mechanisms were developed to implement the required SSLPA functions: (1) a soil loader that forces soil from a filled rotating funnel into each of three ovens located on a carriage, (2) a Geneva drive for rotating and precisely indexing the ovens to receive sample, and (3) a toggle-clamp mechanism for sealing the ovens by forcing <b>circular</b> double <b>knife</b> edges into gold sealing surfaces...|$|R

To {{reduce the need for}} small rolls pack rolling is used, which rolls multiple sheets together to increase the effective starting thickness. As the foil sheets come through the rollers, they are trimmed and slitted with <b>circular</b> or razor-like <b>knives.</b> Trimming refers to the edges of the foil, while slitting involves cutting it into several sheets. Aluminum foil is the most commonly produced product via pack rolling. This is evident from the two different surface finishes; the shiny side is on the roll side and the dull side is against the other sheet of foil.|$|R

Opening of bony skull base has been performed with burrs, chisels, and hammers or standard instruments like punches and <b>circular</b> top <b>knives.</b> The creation of primary bone flaps—as in external craniotomies—is difficult. The piezoelectric osteotomes {{used in the present study}} allows creating a bone flap for endoscopic transnasal approaches in certain areas. The aim of this study was to prove the feasibility of piezoelectric endoscopic transnasal craniotomies. Study Design. Cadaveric study. Methods. On cadaveric specimens (N= 5), a piezoelectric system with specially designed hardware for endonasal application was applied and endoscopic transsphenoidal craniotomies at the sellar floor, tuberculum sellae, and planum sphenoidale were performed up to a size of 3 – 5 [*]cm 2. Results. Bone flaps could be created without fracturing with the piezoosteotome and could be reimplanted. Endoscopic handling was unproblematic and time required was not exceeding standard procedures. Conclusion. In a cadaveric model, the piezoelectric endoscopic transsphenoidal craniotomy (PETC) is technically feasible. This technique allows the surgeon to create a bone flap in endoscopic transnasal approaches similar to existing standard transcranial craniotomies. Future trials will focus on skull base reconstruction using this bone flap...|$|R
40|$|The sealing {{assembly}} for a port of a valve or {{the like}} is disclosed. In detail, the sealing assembly includes the port having a circular shaped end with a circular shaped knife-edge thereon. The sealing assembly further includes a hollow cap having a closed first end with an aperture therethrough and an open second end. The cap further includes internal threads adapted to mate with the external threads of the port. A gasket is mounted within the cap having flat first and second principle sides and made of a deformable metal, the first principle side of the gasket for mounting against the <b>circular</b> shaped <b>knife</b> edge of the port. A plunger having a circular shaped disc portion is adapted to fit within the hollow cap and is engagable with the first principle surface of the gasket and includes a shaft portion extending out of the aperture. The cap and shaft of the plunger include external wrenching flats. Thus when the cap is screwed onto the port and the plunger is prevented from rotating by a wrench mounted on the wrenching flats of the shaft portion of the plunger, the gasket is forced into engagement with the knife edge in pure compression and no rotation of the gasket occurs causing the knife edge to locally deform the gasket sealing of the port...|$|R
