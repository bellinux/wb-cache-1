5|$|Little {{history is}} {{available}} in the period between 2700 BC and 1500 BC, as Egypt (and indeed, Babylon) entered a long violent period of war and destruction. This period saw the Kassites destroy the Babylonian empire in Mesopotamia and the Hyksos destroy the Middle Kingdom of Egypt. When the Pharaohs of Egypt conquered Southwest Asia in around 1500 BC, the cultural ties to Mesopotamia were renewed and Egypt's musical instruments also reflected heavy influence from Asiatic cultures. Under their new cultural influences, the people of the New Kingdom began using oboes, trumpets, lyres, lutes, <b>castanets,</b> and cymbals.|$|E
5|$|Two {{types of}} music are {{traditionally}} associated with Marrakesh. Berber music is influenced by Andalusian classical music and typified by its oud accompaniment. By contrast, Gnaoua music is loud and funky with a sound reminiscent of the Blues. It is performed on handmade instruments such as <b>castanets,</b> ribabs (three-stringed banjos) and deffs (handheld drums). Gnaoua music's rhythm and crescendo take the audience into a mood of trance; the style {{is said to have}} emerged in Marrakesh and Essaouira as a ritual of deliverance from slavery. More recently, several Marrakesh female music groups have also risen to popularity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Conventional context aware {{services}} {{have been built}} in an ad-hoc manner, {{making it difficult to}} build new applications or evolve existing ones. In this paper, we show a sensor proxy based service coordination framework named <b>CASTANET.</b> A <b>CASTANET</b> server serves as a protocol conversion gateway in the network so that different resources in heterogeneous networks can be easily coordinated based on the REST architectural style[1]. Different from existing middleware-based approaches, <b>CASTANET</b> framework aims at coarse-grained service coordination that is compatible with existing web based applications...|$|R

25|$|Modern flamenco is {{a highly}} {{technical}} dance style requiring years of study. The emphasis for {{both male and female}} performers is on lightning-fast footwork performed with absolute precision. In addition, the dancer may have to dance while using props such as <b>castanets,</b> shawls and fans.|$|E
25|$|As well {{as playing}} drums he {{introduced}} {{all manner of}} percussion including: tom-toms, <b>castanets,</b> cowbells, bongos and Spanish bells. The band's members took turns singing lead vocals, which allowed them to give longer and more frequent sets than most of their competitors. This would later {{be one of the}} triggers for Curtis' habit of substance abuse: taking drugs to stay awake and then to induce sleep.|$|E

25|$|Having {{long been}} the poorest part of Spain, Extremadura is a largely rural region known for the Portuguese {{influence}} on its music. As in the northern regions of Spain, there is a rich repertoire for tabor pipe music. The zambomba friction-drum (similar to Portuguese sarronca or Brazilian cuica) is played by pulling on a rope which is inside the drum. It is found throughout Spain. The jota is common, here played with triangles, <b>castanets,</b> guitars, tambourines, accordions and zambombas.|$|E
25|$|The {{instruments}} in Lully's music were: five voices of strings such as dessus (a higher range than soprano), haute-contre (the instrumental {{equivalent of the}} high tenor voice by that name), taille (baritenor), quinte, basse), divided as follows: one voice of violins, three voices of violas, one voice of cello, and basse de viole (viole, viola da gamba). He also utilized guitar, lute, archlute, theorbo, harpsichord, organ, oboe, bassoon, recorder, flute, brass instruments (natural trumpet) and various percussion instruments (<b>castanets,</b> timpani).|$|E

25|$|Jota, popular across Spain, {{might have}} its {{historical}} {{roots in the}} southern part of Aragon. Jota instruments include the <b>castanets,</b> guitar, bandurria, tambourines and sometimes the flute. The guitarro, a unique kind of small guitar also seen in Murcia, seems Aragonese in origin. Besides its music for stick-dances and dulzaina (shawm), Aragon has its own gaita de boto (bagpipes) and chiflo (tabor pipe). As in the Basque country, Aragonese chiflo can be played along to a chicotén string-drum (psaltery) rhythm.|$|E
25|$|Real musical instruments, not {{previously}} {{associated with the}} pipe organ, were installed in the pipe chambers to be pneumatically operated at will by the organist. Such instruments as piano, drums, cymbals, xylophone, marimba, orchestra bells, chimes, <b>castanets,</b> wood blocks, and even tuned sleigh bells could be played from the organ keyboards. Sound effects such as train and boat whistles, car horns, sirens, bird whistles, and an imitation of ocean surf {{could be used to}} great effect at appropriate times during a silent film.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to a lack}} of {{detailed}} records, little is known about Swiss folk music prior to the 19th century. Some 16th-century lute tablatures have been reconstructed into authentic instrumental arrangements; however, the first major source of information comes from 19th-century collections of folk songs, and work done by musicologist Hanny Christen. One of the oldest varieties of folk music was the Swiss song Kühreihen, an agricultural Alpine song in the Lydian mode. Traditional instruments included alphorn, hammered dulcimer, fife, hurdy-gurdy, <b>castanets,</b> rebec, bagpipe, cittern and shawm.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Castanet</b> Club was a stage {{show that}} started in the steel town of Newcastle in 1982. It {{launched}} entertainment careers for several of its players: as well as Maynard there was Mikey Robbins, Steve Abbott (aka the Sandman), Glen Butcher and Play School presenter Angela Moore (aka Shirley Purvis) - often under outrageous pseudonyms such as [...] "Major Bum Sore and the Rough Riders"As the Comedy-Cabaret-Big-Band show grew more successful, they toured nationally, including a sell-out season at the 1984 Adelaide Festival where they won the [...] "Best of the Fringe" [...] award against approximately 300 other performers from around the country. The <b>Castanet</b> Club went on to play London and the Edinburgh Festival in Scotland, where audiences and critics responded well: [...] "They were an hilarious kaleidoscope of colour, music, movement, satire and goodwill." [...] This period is immortalised in the film they made in 1990, The <b>Castanet</b> Club. Despite their on-stage craziness, the <b>Castanet</b> Club members were highly intelligent, perhaps best demonstrated when two separate members won the television quiz show Sale of the Century: Warren Coleman and Russell Cheek. After nine years, the <b>Castanet</b> Club played their final show in 1991.|$|R
25|$|Slave {{characters}} in general {{came to be}} low-comedy types with names that matched the instruments they played: Brudder Tambo (or simply Tambo) for the tambourine and Brudder Bones (or Bones) for the bone <b>castanets</b> or bones. These endmen (for {{their position in the}} minstrel semicircle) were ignorant and poorly spoken, being conned, electrocuted, or run over in various sketches. They happily shared their stupidity; one slave character said that to get to China, one had only to go up in a balloon and wait for the world to rotate below. Highly musical and unable to sit still, they constantly contorted their bodies wildly while singing.|$|E
25|$|Baroque {{instruments}} {{included some}} instruments {{from the earlier}} periods (e.g., the hurdy-gurdy and recorder) {{and a number of}} new instruments (e.g, the oboe, bassoon, cello, contrabass and fortepiano). Some instruments from previous eras fell into disuse, such as the shawm and the wooden cornet. The key Baroque instruments for strings included the violin, viol, viola, viola d'amore, cello, contrabass, lute, theorbo (which often played the basso continuo parts), mandolin, cittern, Baroque guitar, harp and hurdy-gurdy. Woodwinds included the Baroque flute, Baroque oboe, rackett, recorder and the bassoon. Brass instruments included the cornett, natural horn, Baroque trumpet, serpent and the trombone. Keyboard instruments included the clavichord, the harpsichord, the pipe organ, and, later in the period, the fortepiano (an early version of the piano). Percussion instruments included the timpani, snare drum, tambourine and the <b>castanets.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{music by}} Torrejón conserves {{much of the}} {{character}} and the idiosyncrasies contained in the comedies of Calderón as previously set by Juan Hidalgo. It is speculated that Torrejón {{may have been one}} of Hidalgo's pupils and that his work was possibly a source of inspiration for Torrejón in the composition of his own version. The score makes use of a variety of Spanish song types and Latin American musical influences, incorporating Latin American melodies and rhythms into the overall European dramatic and harmonic structure. The erotic nature of the text is heightened by the use of dance rhythms, musical repetitions, and sensual lyrical lines. The ornamental writing is also used deftly to emphasize the drama of the text. The exact instrumentation has not been found in Torrejón y Velasco's surviving original scores. However, the scores of other late seventeenth century musical plays in Spain suggest that the instruments would include harps, guitars, viols, violins, clarino and regular trumpets, drums, and <b>castanets.</b>|$|E

The lyrics to the song are centred on a lost love theme, with <b>castanets</b> in the background. During the song, the singer also sings in Italian on its chorus, when everything else is Spanish. According to biographer David Sinclair in his book Spice Girls Revisited: How The Spice Girls Reinvented Pop, Halliwell continued to explore the Riviera-pop theme of the Spice Girls' song, [...] "Viva Forever", whilst [...] "murmuring sweet nothings in a peculiar brand of estuary Spanish while <b>castanets</b> and timbales clattered alongside a cod-flamenco guitar".|$|E
