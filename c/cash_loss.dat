50|$|The hotel reopened in September 1979, {{managed by}} the Fairmont chain, as The Fairmont Philadelphia. The {{following}} year, Westin Hotels bought a 49-percent interest in the hotel. Westin assumed management on November 1, 1980 and the hotel returned to its original name, Bellevue Stratford. By the mid-1980s, the hotel, which had become The Westin Bellevue Stratford, was struggling to fill its hundreds of rooms. Philadelphia had lower hotel occupancy rates than other major East Coast cities at the time, and a lengthy conflict between city and state officials over financing for a new convention center, which would eventually open in 1993, meant that demand for hotel rooms in Center City was even lower than expected. With an occupancy rate of 55 percent, far below the 65-70 percent necessary to break even, and having operated at a total <b>cash</b> <b>loss</b> of $25 million from 1979-1985, never once turning a profit since its restoration, the hotel's owners announced in January 1986 that it would close on February 2. A lawsuit by the union representing the hotel's 450+ employees over the short notice given to its members, resulted in an agreement to keep the hotel open until April 2, but with the hotel's advance bookings transferred to other hotels {{as a result of}} the closure announcement, only two floors of guest rooms still in use, and only 10 to 15 guests a night in the enormous building by that point, the union accepted a settlement of $500,000 and a promise that the renovated hotel would remain a union shop and agreed to an earlier closing date.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityThe Pilgrims {{used the}} natural passage at the {{shoulders}} of Cape Cod to avoid the dangerous shoals off the outer reaches of the Cape. The idea of a canal through this valley intrigued all. The General Court authorized a survey in 1698, and we have reports of surveys made in 1775, 1791, 1818, 1825, and 1862 as well as later ones. Numerous companies {{wanted to build a}} canal; two even started (1880, 1883); but none could get sufficient financial backing to carry it through to completion. In 1899, Dewitt C. Flanagan secured a charter for the Boston, Cape Cod and New York Canal Company, and, in 1906, persuaded August Belmont to organize a syndicate to finance the $ 12, 000, 000 project. Belmont became interested in a canal because it would (1) provide a safer passage, (2) shorten the coastwise distance, (3) be a memorial to his maternal ancestors, the Perrys, (4) be of value to the nation in time of war, and (5) return a reasonable profit. Belmont had just completed the first highly successful New York subway. His engineer, William Barclay Parsons, began work on the sea-level canal in June, 1909. Inadequate equipment and numerous and enormous boulders delayed construction and added to the cost. The canal opened on July 29, 1914. Traffic did not measure up to expectations. A strong current, a narrow channel, and two disastrous wrecks discouraged mariners. Because of the German U-boat threat, the Government took over the operation of the canal in July, 1918. The Railroad Administration returned it to its unwilling owners on March 1, 1920. Traffic was sufficient to meet operating expenses but not sufficient to pay interest on the bonded debt. The United States Government was interested in the Cape Cod Canal as part of the intracoastal waterways system. Preliminary negotiations for its purchase (1916) broke down. Under condemnation proceedings (1919), a jury returned a verdict of $ 16, 000, 000 for the company, but this was overturned on the appeal. The company signed a contract with the Government for the sale of the canal at a price of $ 11, 500, 000 (1921). The company had to make further concessions, however, and carry on some strenuous lobbying before Congress appropriated the necessary funds. The Belmont family suffered a minimum <b>cash</b> <b>loss</b> of $ 500, 000 and, giving due consideration to interest and other factors, may have lost as much as $ 5, 000, 000. The United States Army Corps of Engineers took over the canal (March 31, 1928) as a toll-free waterway. They enlarged and deepened it during the depression. During World War II, tremendous tonnage passed through the canal to avoid the German submarine menace. Its value to national defense in those trying days was incalculable. The canal is seventeen miles long, of which eight miles is the land cut. With a width of four hundred and eighty feet and a depth of thirty-two feet, it is the widest artificial sea-level canal in the world. Its total cost to the Government was $ 42, 000, 000 (1950). The chief sources of information on the Cape Cod Canal are the files of the Army Engineers in the Records Holding Section at the Boston Army Base and the files in their Buzzards Bay office, Mr. Belmont's papers, and Congressional and state documents...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} estimation error in a simple single-period portfolio choice problem when the investor has power utility and asset returns are jointly lognormally distributed. These assumptions imply that such an investor selects portfolios using a modified mean-variance framework where the parameters {{that he has to}} estimate are the mean vector of log returns and the covariance matrix of log returns. Following Chopra and Ziemba (1993), I simulate estimation error in what are assumed to be the true mean vector and the true covariance matrix and the impact of estimation error is measured in terms of percentage <b>cash</b> equivalence <b>loss</b> for the investor. To obtain estimation error sizes that are similar to the estimation error sizes in actual estimates, I use a Bayesian approach and Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods. The empirical results differ significantly from Chopra and Ziemba (1993), suggesting that the effect of estimation error may have been overestimated in the past. Furthermore, the results tend to question the traditional viewpoint that estimating the covariance matrix correctly is strictly less important than estimating the mean vector correctly.

40|$|Text in EnglishThe {{goals of}} this {{research}} were to explore, describe and explain the crime of associated robbery, {{which at the time}} of this study, was a scientifically unknown phenomenon. Associated robbery is defined as “a bank-related robbery (by association) of cash or attempt thereto, committed against a bank client or his/her delegate, at any stage while en-route to or from a bank branch, ATM or cash centre or inside the branch to effect a deposit, or, withdrawal” (SABRIC 2013 : 4) This robbery is divided into two main categories, namely robbery before cash deposit and robbery after cash withdrawal. As found in literature and also evident in the findings of this study, more incidents and related <b>cash</b> <b>losses</b> are reported from robbery after withdrawal, which is sub-divided into muti scam, money bomb and spiked drink. This study followed an exploratory, sequential, mixed-method research approach where the qualitative phase took place first – followed by the quantitative phase. The topic was firstly explored by collecting qualitative data via in-depth, one-on-one interviews (from a phenomenological point of view) where mutual meaning was sought, as understood by victims of associated robbery. To gather quantitative data, 500 bank clients (i. e. individuals, small business owners and stokvel/saving club members) completed a survey questionnaire. Their perspective on the phenomenon of associated robbery was thus explained and described through the use of descriptive statistics, particularly univariate and bivariate statistical analysis. The most significant contribution made by this study, is embedment of the preventative measures used by the banking industry and other stakeholders such as the SAPS into the Situational Crime Prevention (SCP) and Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) principles approaches. This model is heavily grounded on 12 SCP strategies, namely: access control; deflecting offenders; controlling facilitation; entry/exist screening; formal surveillance; surveillance by employees; natural surveillance; target removal; reducing temptation; rule setting; stimulating conscience; and facilitating compliance. Furthermore, the model emphasises that the combating of associated robberies is a collaborative effort and thus the individual (bank client), the banking industry, the criminal justice system (CJS) and the general public all have to work together in fighting this endemic. The lack of knowledge mainly from a victim’s perspective was identified as one of the challenges faced. However, this presented an opportunity for this study to make a significant contribution to the development of scientific literature. Moreover, the use of opportunity theories to explain the reasons why individuals are victimised placed the phenomenon in the criminological research milieu – thus pioneering a way for researchers who may wish to conduct future research on the same topic.

40|$|Bond issuers {{frequently}} immunize/hedge {{their interest}} rate exposure {{by means of}} interest rate swaps (IRS). The receiving leg matches all bond cash-flows, while the pay leg requires floating rate coupon payments of form LIBOR + a spread.

Using market data we show that under a traditional IRS hedging strategy an investor could still experience significant <b>cash</b> flow <b>losses</b> given a 1 % shift in the underlying benchmark yield curve. We consider the instantaneous interest-rate risk of a bond portfolio that allows for general changes in interest rates. We make two contributions. The paper analyzes the size of hedging imperfections arising from the widening of the floating rate spread in a traditional swap contract and subsequently proposes two new practical, effective and analytically tractable swap structures; Structure 1 : An Improved Parallel Hedge Swap, hedges against parallel shifts of the yield curve and Structure 2 : An Improved Non-Parallel Hedge Swap, hedges against any movement of the swap curve.

40|$|The Ford Motor Company’s current cash {{holdings}} of approximately $ 25 B are primarily invested in bonds with maturities {{ranging from a}} few months to five years. Due to the large size of this <b>cash</b> holding, <b>losses</b> in the bond market could result in a substantial negative impact to quarterly profits. To gauge the size of this risk, the Portfolio Management Department in Treasury, uses a program called RiskManager ®, which utilizes a concept called value at risk (VaR). VaR summarizes the expected maximum loss to a financial portfolio under various conditions. The value at risk methodology rests upon a number of assumptions about the behavior and statistical properties of financial market variables. One important component of a VaR model is how it measures the fluctuations in value (volatility) of market instruments like bonds. The accuracy of these volatility estimates directly affects the end-user’s confidence in the risk level determined by the VaR calculation. We have applied the statistical methodology called bootstrapping to compare the accuracy of the volatility estimates usable in the VaR model. In this report, we look at the meaning of VaR, including aspects of its calculation methodology. Then we introduce the bootstrapping method. Bootstrapping allows one to infer the standard error of statistical parameters based upon a limited sample size. Using the bootstrapping method we can approximate th...|$|R
