50|$|Most {{cars are}} {{equipped}} with <b>centrifugal</b> <b>brake</b> system that controls its maximum speed by limiting the rotational speed of the run rollers. Riders are responsible to observe a safe distance as a common courtesy to the riders in front. Each car is equipped with shock-absorbing front and rear bumpers in case of collision, which occurs when riders are driving too fast and not leaving enough space for braking distance. Newer generation coasters {{are equipped with}} an anti-collision system that automatically apply the brakes if the rider gets {{too close to the}} car ahead.|$|E
5000|$|The {{centrifugal}} governor {{is often used}} in the cognitive sciences {{as an example of}} a dynamic system, in which the representation of information cannot be clearly separated from the operations being applied to the representation. And, because the governor is a servomechanism, its analysis in a dynamic system is not trivial. In 1868, James Clerk Maxwell wrote a famous paper [...] "On governors" [...] that is widely considered a classic in feedback control theory. Maxwell distinguishes moderators (a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>brake)</b> and governors which control motive power input. He considers devices by James Watt, Professor James Thomson, Fleeming Jenkin, William Thomson, LÃ©on Foucault and Carl Wilhelm Siemens (a liquid governor).|$|E

5000|$|Mechanical Snubber: Whilst {{having the}} same {{application}} as the hydraulic snubber, retardation of the pipe is due to <b>centrifugal</b> <b>braking</b> within the snubber. A split flywheel is made to rotate at high velocity causing steel balls to be forced radially outwards. The flywheel is forced apart by the steel balls causing braking plates to come together thus retarding the axial displacement of the snubber. Rotation of the flywheel is generated by the linear displacement of the main rod acting on a ball-screw or similar device. It is also very expensive.|$|R

40|$|The requirements, design, and {{performance}} of a centrifugal regulator aimed at limiting deployment rates of deployable elements are discussed. The overall mechanism is comprised of four distinct functional parts in a machined housing: (1) the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>brake</b> device, which checks the payout of a deployment cable; (2) the reducing gear, which produces the spin rate necesary for the braking device; (3) the payout device, which allows the unwinding of the cable; and (4) the locking device, which prevents untimely unwinding. The centrifugal regulator is set into operation by a threshold tension of the cable which unlocks the mechanism and allows unwinding. The pulley of the windout device drives the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>brake</b> {{with the help of}} the reducing gear. The centrifugal force pushes aside weights that produce friction of the studs in a cylindrical housing. The mechanism behaved well at qualification temperature and vibrations...|$|E

5000|$|To cast a baitcasting rod and reel, {{the reel}} {{is turned on}} its side, the [...] "free spool" [...] feature engaged, and the thumb placed on the spool to hold the lure in position. The cast is {{performed}} by snapping the rod backward to the 2 o'clock position, then casting it forward in a smooth motion, allowing the lure to pull the line from the reel. The thumb is used to contact the line, moderating the revolutions of the spool and braking the lure when it reaches the desired aiming point. Though modern <b>centrifugal</b> and/or magnetic <b>braking</b> systems help to control backlash, using a bait casting reel still requires practice and {{a certain amount of}} finesse {{on the part of the}} fisherman for best results.|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} {{originally}} founded on 1 November 1919 as Pelger in Rotterdam in the Netherlands by Mr. Willem D. Pelger, with a funding capital of 40 Dutch guilders The company {{started at the}} Zwanesteeg 4 in Rotterdam as a direct current electric motor repair shop. In 1920 the first employee was offered a job. Direct current motors were in use in Rotterdam, {{as a result of}} the direct current power supply instead of alternating current supply in these early days of electric grid. In March 1926 the company moved to the Paardenstraat 5 and in May 1929 they moved on to the Van Speykstraat 86-102 in Rotterdam. In 1936 a <b>centrifugal</b> fan, <b>brake</b> motors and small induction motors program from another manufacturer named HSM (short for: Heinke-Schuitema-Musselkanaal) in Musselkanaal was bought and brought to Rotterdam. Mr. K.W. Heinke, one of the former owners and mechanical engineer of HSM also moved to work at the factory in Rotterdam. In the same year 40 off. patents were applied for, with reference to three inventions: the centrifugal switch, the centrifugal fan housing and the principle of a squirrel-cage rotor. The Pelger repair shop gradually evolved into a factory designing and manufacturing special electric motors and centrifugal fans. After some time the two original company names Pelger and HSM were changed into a variant of the existing names: Holland Special Machines Pelger or HSM-Pelger.|$|R
40|$|In this research, {{results of}} the {{designed}} radial inflow turbo-expander with back swept curve blade rotor have been presented. The spiral casing is designed considering constant mean flow velocity and the areas of crosssections of the spiral casing are decreased gradually by reducing {{the width of the}} flow areas from inlet to end. The rotor is shrouded to cope up with centrifugal as well as bending load on the vanes of the rotor and avoid energy losses due to the tip clearance. The degree of reaction is selected as 0. 25 in contrast to usual value of 0. 5 at design point on the consideration of absolute velocity of air at nozzle exit needs to be higher than the rotor tip speed. The rotor shaft assembly is supported by externally pressured air bearing. The turbine with coupled <b>brake</b> <b>centrifugal</b> compressor, aerostatic radial and thrust bearing and test rig are developed for conducting experiments. The experiments are conducted with compressed cold air by varying mass flow rates and pressure ratios. At the pressure ratio of 1. 6 the temperature drop of 12. 5 o C of flowing air across turbo expander is achieved and 41 % total to static efficiency is obtained. The findings of exhaustive experimentation with the developed turbo expander are illustrated in details in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Solar array {{rotation}} mechanism provides a hinged joint between the solar panel and satellite body, smooth {{rotation of the}} solar array into deployed position and its fixation in this position. After unlocking of solar panel (while in orbit), rotation bracket turns towards ready-to-work position under the action of driving spring. During deployment, once reached the required operating angle (defined by power subsystem engineer), the rotation bracket collides with the fixed bracket that is mounted on body of the satellite, to stop rotation. Due {{to the effect of}} collision force that may alter the {{rotation mechanism}} function, design of <b>centrifugal</b> <b>brake</b> is essential. At stoppage moment micro-switches activate final position sensor and a stopper locks the rotation bracket. Design of spring and <b>centrifugal</b> <b>brake</b> components, static finite element stress analysis of primary structure body of rotation mechanism at stoppage moment have been obtained. Last, reliability analysis of rotation mechanism is evaluated. The benefit {{of this study is to}} aid in the design of rotation mechanism that can be used in micro-satellite applications.

40|$|An {{improved}} braking cable-payout mechanism {{has been}} developed. Whereas other such mechanisms operate at payout speeds that {{vary with the}} length of payout, this mechanism operates at approximately constant payout speed, regardless {{of the length of}} cord that has already been paid out. The present mechanism includes a spool, a capstan assembly, and centrifugal brakes. The spool is used to store the cord and, unlike in the prior mechanism, is not involved in the primary braking function. That is, the spool operates {{in such a way that}} the cord is unwound from the spool at low tension. The spool is connected to the rest of the mechanism through a constant- torque slip clutch. The clutch must slip in order to pay out the cord. As the cord leaves the spool, it passes into the capstan assembly, wherein its direction is changed by use of the first of three idler sheaves and it is then routed into the first of three grooves on a capstan. After completing less than a full circle in the first groove, the cord passes over the second idler sheave, which is positioned to enable the cord to make the transition to the second groove on the capstan. Similarly, a third idler sheave enables the cord to make the transition to the third groove on the capstan. After traveling less than a full circle in the third groove, the cord leaves the capstan along the payout path. The total wrap angle afforded by this capstan-and-idler arrangement is large enough to prevent slippage between the cord and the capstan. The capstan is connected to a shaft that, in turn, is connected to a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>brake.</b> Hence, the effective payout radius, for purposes of braking, is not the varying radius of the remaining cord on the spool but, rather, the constant radius of the grooves in the capstan. The payout speed is determined primarily by this radius and by the characteristics of the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>brake.</b> Therefore, the payout speed is more nearly constant in this mechanism than in the prior mechanism...|$|E
5000|$|Dalton Bros first flour Mill - North East Corner of Summer and Sale Streets ("The {{formal opening}} of Messrs. Dalton Bros. new flour mill took place to-day, and was celebrated with a banquet, at which over 300 persons sat down. Mr. James Dalton {{occupied}} the chair, {{and there were}} present Messer's. Torps, M.L A., J. T, Lane, P. M.., the Mayors of Orange and East Orange, {{and most of the}} leading citizens. The mill was started by the Misses Jane and Winifred Dalton, daughters of the proprietors. The erection of the mill was started 12 month ago, the building being from plans by Messer's. A. D. Nelson and Co., Sydney, who contracted for the erection of all the machinery. The machinery was made by Messer's Hind and Lund, of Preston, Lancashire, England. In the meantime while, the construction of the mill was going on the ironwork was being constructed by Messer's A. D. Nelson in Sydney. The machinery is considerably heavier than that in any other mill in New South Wales There are five brake roller mills 40in. Long and 10in. in diameter. The reduction plant contains nine sets of rollers, each 25in. long and 10in. in diameter, and each of the mills has four rollers. There are 17 acts of elevators. On the second floor is the Atlas purifiers, so constructed as to dispense with storeroom and dust collectors. On the third floor are the centrifugals and scalpers. On the floor are more <b>centrifugals</b> and <b>brake</b> reels. In the basement the shafting for driving the reduction and brake rolls extends the full length of the building. One feature of the machinery is that the motive power is in every case direct from the engine to each line of shafting. The new building contains 300,000 bricks, and 12,000 yards of earth were excavated for the foundations. The plant {{is said to be the}} largest and most expensive in the colony" [...] - from The Sydney Morning Herald - Tuesday 19 April 1892). The mill ceased production in 1908 when the Dalton Bros new mill was opened (below).|$|R
