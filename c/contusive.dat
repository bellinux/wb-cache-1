40|$|AIM: To {{explore the}} {{curative}} effect of chymotrypsin in treating <b>contusive</b> hyphema at grade Ⅲ. METHODS: Totally 84 patients(84 eyes) with <b>contusive</b> hyphema at grade Ⅲ were analyzed retrospectively. They were randomly divided into treatment group(42 cases) and control group(42 cases). The chymotrypsin was administrated {{in addition to}} routine treatment for treatment group, while the control group adoptedroutine treatment.

40|$|Spasticity is a {{frequent}} chronic complication in individuals {{with spinal cord injury}} (SCI). However, the severity of spasticity varies in patients with SCI. Therefore, an evaluation method is needed to determine the severity of spasticity. We used a <b>contusive</b> SCI model that is suitable for clinical translation. In this study, we examined the feasibility of the swimming test and an EMG for evaluating spasticity in a <b>contusive</b> SCI rat model. Sprague-Dawley rats received an injury at the 8 th thoracic vertebra. Swimming tests were performed 3 to 6 weeks after SCI induction. We placed the SCI rats into spasticity-strong or spasticity-weak groups based on the frequency of spastic behavior during the swimming test. Subsequently, we recorded the Hoffman reflex (H-reflex) and examined the immunoreactivity of serotonin (5 -HT) and its receptor (5 -HT 2 A) in the spinal tissues of the SCI rats. The spasticity-strong group had significantly decreased rate-dependent depression of the H-reflex compared to the spasticity-weak group. The area of 5 -HT 2 A receptor immunoreactivity was significantly increased in the spasticity-strong group. Thus, both electrophysiological and histological evaluations indicate that the spasticity-strong group presented with a more severe upper motor neuron syndrome. We also observed the groups in their cages for 20 hours. Our results suggest that the swimming test provides an accurate evaluation of spasticity in this <b>contusive</b> SCI model. We believe that the swimming test is an effective method for evaluating spastic behaviors and developing treatments targeting spasticity after SCI...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) {{has been}} suggest-ed to have neuroprotective effects against spinal cord in-jury (SCI); however, {{few studies have}} {{examined}} these effects and the corresponding mechanism. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective ef-fect and underlying mechanism of TMP against <b>contusive</b> SCI. Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly di-vided into Sham, normal saline (NS) and TMP groups. Each group was divided into subgroups according to the time of sacrifice: 1, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days post-injury. Laminectomy was performed in all groups, followed by <b>contusive</b> SCI establishment in the TMP and NS groups. TMP (80 mg/kg) was injected thereafter daily from 3 to 7 days post-injury in the TMP group, which was replaced by equal volume of normal saline in the NS group. The Basso–Beattie–Bresnahan (BBB) Locomotor Rating Scale was measured at different time points post-injury to ap-praise locomotor functional recovery. Quantitative real-time PCR and immunofluorescence were used to assess the spatio-temporal expression of peroxisome proliferator-ac-tivated receptor-c coactivator- 1 a (PGC- 1 a), while western blot was adopted to detect the effect of TMP on PGC- 1 a. Neural apoptotic changes and neuronal survival were evaluated using the TUNEL method and Nissl staining, respectively. TMP treatment markedly increased PGC- 1 a expression, neuronal survival and BBB locomotor scores, while also reducing neural apoptosis. These results demonstrate that TMP is neuroprotective against <b>contusive</b> SCI, with the inhibition of neural apoptosis and increase of neuronal survival. The sustained expression of PGC- 1 a may partially contribute to the TMP-mediated neuropro-tective effect...|$|E
40|$|Transplantations {{of human}} stem cell {{derivatives}} {{have been widely}} investigated in rodent models for the potential restoration of function of neural pathways after spinal cord injury (SCI). Studies have already demonstrated cells survival following transplantation in SCI. We sought to evaluate survival and potential therapeutic effects of transplanted human embryonic stem (hES) cell-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in a <b>contusive</b> injury in rats. Bioluminescence imaging was utilized to verify survivability of cells up to 4 weeks, and somatosensory evoked potential (SSEPs) were recorded at the cortex to monitor function of sensory pathways throughout the 6 -week recovery period. hES cells were transduced with the firefly luciferase gene and differentiated into OPCs. OPCs were transplanted into the lesion epicenter of rat spinal cords 2 hours after inducing a moderate <b>contusive</b> SCI. The hES-treatment group showed improved SSEPs, including increased amplitude and decreased latencies, compared to the control group. The bioluminescence of transplanted OPCs decreased by 97 % in the injured spinal cord compared to only 80 % when injected into an uninjured spinal cord. Bioluminescence increased in both experimental groups such that by week 3, no statistical difference was detected, signifying that the cells survived and proliferated independent of injury. Post-mortem histology of the spinal cords showed integration of human cells expressing mature oligodendrocyte markers and myelin basic protein without the expression of markers for astrocytes (GFAP) or pluripotent cells (OCT 4). hES-derived OPCs transplanted 2 hours after <b>contusive</b> SCI survive and differentiate into OLs that produce MBP. Treated rats demonstrated functional improvements in SSEP amplitudes and latencies compared to controls as early as 1 week post-injury. Finally, the hostile injury microenvironment at 2 hours post-injury initially caused increased cell death but {{did not affect the}} long-term cell proliferation or survival, indicating that cells can be transplanted sooner than conventionally accepted...|$|E
40|$|We {{previously}} {{demonstrated that}} daily, hour-long training sessions significantly improved both locomotor (limb kinematics, gait, and hindlimb flexor-extensor bursting patterns) and nonlocomotor (bladder function and at-level mechanical allodynia) functions following a moderate <b>contusive</b> spinal cord injury. The amount of training {{needed to achieve}} this recovery is unknown. Furthermore, whether this recovery is induced primarily by neuronal activity below the lesion or other aspects related to general exercise is unclear. Therefore, the current study objectives were to (1) test the efficacy of 30 minutes of step training for recovery following a clinically relevant contusion injury in male Wistar rats and (2) test the efficacy of training without hindlimb engagement. The results indicate that as little as 30 minutes of step training six days per week enhances overground locomotion in male rats with <b>contusive</b> spinal cord injury but does not alter allodynia or bladder function. Thirty minutes of forelimb-only exercise did not alter locomotion, allodynia, or bladder function, and neither training protocol altered the amount of in-cage activity. Taken together, locomotor improvements were facilitated by hindlimb step training for 30 minutes, but longer durations of training are required to affect nonlocomotor systems...|$|E
40|$|Blocking {{the action}} of {{inhibitory}} molecules at sites of central nervous system injury has been proposed as a strategy to promote axonal regeneration and functional recovery. We have previously shown that genetic deletion or competitive antagonism of EphA 4 receptor activity promotes axonal regeneration and functional recovery in a mouse model of lateral hemisection spinal cord injury. Here we have assessed the effect of blocking EphA 4 activation using the competitive antagonist EphA 4 -Fc in a rat model of thoracic <b>contusive</b> spinal cord injury. Using a ledged tapered balance beam and open-field testing, we observed significant improvements in recovery of locomotor function after EphA 4 -Fc treatment. Consistent with functional improvement, using high-resolution ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging at 16. 4 T, we found that rats treated with EphA 4 -Fc had a significantly increased cross-sectional area of the dorsal funiculus caudal to the injury epicenter compared with controls. Our findings indicate that EphA 4 -Fc promotes functional recovery following <b>contusive</b> spinal cord injury and provides further support for the therapeutic benefit of treatment with the competitive antagonist in acute cases of spinal cord injury.

40|$|White matter (WM) loss is a {{critical}} event after spinal cord injury (SCI). Conventionally, such loss has been measured with histological and histochemical approaches, although the procedures are complex and may cause artifact. Recently, coherent Raman microscopy has been proven to be an emerging technology to study de- and remyelination of the injured spinal cord; however, limited penetration depth and small imaging field prevent it from comprehensive assessments of large areas of damaged tissues. Here, we report the use of bond-selective photoacoustic (PA) imaging with 1730 -nm excitation, where the first overtone vibration of CH 2 bond is located, to assess WM loss after a <b>contusive</b> SCI in adult rats. By employing the first overtone vibration of CH 2 bond as the contrast, the mapping of the WM in an intact spinal cord was achieved in a label-free three-dimensional manner, and the physiological change of the spinal cord before and after injury was observed. Moreover, {{the recovery of the}} spinal cord from <b>contusive</b> injury with the treatment of a neuroprotective nanomedicine ferulic-acid-conjugated glycol chitosan (FA-GC) was also observed.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{pharmacological}} {{effects of}} methylprednisolone (MP) and ganglioside GM- 1 on spinal injuries have been thoroughly investigated, {{but only a}} few studies have evaluated the interaction between these two drugs. METHODS: Twenty-four Wistar rats were subjected to <b>contusive</b> injury of the spinal cord produced by the NYU system. These animals were divided into four groups: group I was injected with MP; group II was injected with GM- 1; group III was injected with MP together with GM- 1; and group control received physiological serum. The animals were evaluated with regard to their recovery of locomotive function by means of the BBB test on the second, seventh and fourteenth days after receiving the <b>contusive</b> injury to the spinal cord.

RESULTS: This study demonstrated that the MP and GM- 1 groups presented functional results that were better than those of the control group, although the enhanced recovery of group II (GM- 1) relative to the control group was not statistically significant (p> 0. 05). The most notable recovery of locomotive function was observed in the group that received MP alone (p< 0. 05).

In addition, the immunohistochemical detection of the immediate-early gene c-fos was used to identify basal patterns of neural activity at this time. The numbers and laminar locations of NADPH-d- and c-fos-positive cells were examined in spinal segments adjacent to the site of injury (T 12 –S 3) as well as those distant from the injury (C 3 –C 5) in both SCI and un-injured rats. Our data show that <b>contusive</b> SCI results in a significant reduction in NADPH-d labelling in the superficial dorsal horn, and a significant increase in NADPH-d expression in small bipolar neurons and large motoneurons in the ventral horn {{at the site of the}} injury. In spinal segments distant to the injury site (C 3 –C 5), NADPH-d activity did not differ from that of uninjured controls. Furthermore, significant reductions in the levels of c-fos expression were observed in SCI rats, in spinal segments both at and distant to the site of injury for all spinal laminae. The only exception was a dramatic increase observed in the sacral parasympathetic nucleus.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is {{a protein}} that stimulates differentiation, proliferation, and {{survival}} of {{cells in the}} granulocytic lineage. Recently, a neuroprotective effect of G-CSF was reported in a model of cerebral infarction and we previously reported the same effect in studies of murine spinal cord injury (SCI). The aim {{of the present study}} was to elucidate the potential therapeutic effect of G-CSF for SCI in rats. METHODS: Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were used in the present study. <b>Contusive</b> SCI was introduced using the Infinite Horizon Impactor (magnitude: 200 kilodyne). Recombinant human G-CSF (15. 0 µg/kg) was administered by tail vein injection at 1 h after surgery and daily the next four days. The vehicle control rats received equal volumes of normal saline at the same time points. RESULTS: Using a <b>contusive</b> SCI model to examine the neuroprotective potential of G-CSF, we found that G-CSF suppressed the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL- 1 beta and TNF- alpha) in mRNA and protein levels. Histological assessment with luxol fast blue staining revealed that the area of white matter spared in the injured spinal cord was significantly larger in G-CSF-treated rats. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that G-CSF promoted up-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-Xl on oligpodendrocytes and suppressed apoptosis of oligodendrocytes after SCI. Moreover, administration of G-CSF promoted better functional recovery of hind limbs. CONCLUSIONS: G-CSF protects oligodendrocyte from SCI-induced cell death via the suppression of inflammatory cytokines and up-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein. As a result, G-CSF attenuates white matter loss and promotes hindlimb functional recovery...|$|E
40|$|Cervical {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI) damages axons and motor neurons {{responsible}} for ipsilateral forelimb function and causes demyelination and oligodendrocyte death. Inhibition of the phosphatase and tensin homologue, PTEN, promotes neural cell survival, neuroprotection and regeneration in vivo and in vitro. PTEN inhibition can also promote oligodendrocyte-mediated myelination of axons in vitro likely through Akt activation. We recently demonstrated that acute treatment with phosphatase PTEN inhibitor, bisperoxovanadium (bpV) -pic reduced tissue damage, neuron death, and promoted functional recovery after cervical hemi-contusion SCI. Evidence suggests bpV can promote myelin stability; however, bpV effects on myelination and oligodendrocytes in <b>contusive</b> SCI models are unclear. We hypothesized that bpV could increase myelin around the injury site through sparing or remyelination, and that bpV treatment may promote increased numbers of oligodendrocytes. Using histological and immunofluorescence labeling, we found that bpV treatment promoted significant spared white matter (30 %; p < 0. 01) and Luxol Fast Blue (LFB) + myelin area rostral (Veh: 0. 56 ± 0. 01 vs. bpV: 0. 64 ± 0. 02; p < 0. 05) and at the epicenter (Veh: 0. 4175 ± 0. 03 vs. bpV: 0. 5400 ± 0. 03; p < 0. 05).

40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to employ {{high-resolution}} MRI to investigate the spatiotemporal development of pathological features associated with <b>contusive</b> spinal cord injury (SCI) in mice. Experimental mice were subjected to either sham surgery or moderate <b>contusive</b> SCI. A 16. 4 -T small-animal MR system was employed for nondestructive imaging of post-mortem, fixed spinal cord specimens at the subacute (7 ?days) and more chronic (2835 days) stages post-injury. Routine histological techniques were used for subsequent investigation of the observed neuropathology at the microscopic level. The central core of the lesion appeared as a dark hypo-intense area on MR images at all time points investigated. Small focal hypo-intense spots were also observed spreading through the dorsal funiculi proximal and distal to the site of impact, an area that is known to undergo gliosis and Wallerian degeneration in response to injury. Histological examination revealed these hypo-intense spots to be high in iron content as determined by Prussian blue staining. Quantitative image analysis confirmed the increased presence of iron deposits at all post-injury time points investigated (p < 0. 05). Distant iron deposits were also detectable through live imaging without the use of contrast-enhancing agents, enabling the longitudinal investigation of this pathology in individual animals. Further immunohistochemical evaluation showed that intracellular iron deposits localised to macrophages/microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the subacute phase of SCI, but predominantly to glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive, CC- 1 -positive astrocytes at later stages of recovery. Progressive, widespread intracellular iron accumulation is thus a normal feature of SCI in mice, and high-resolution MRI can be effectively used to detect and monitor these neuropathological changes with time.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the sensitivity of ultra-high field (16. 4 T) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI; 70 mu m in-plane resolution, 1 mm slice thickness) to evaluate the spatiotemporal development of severe mid-thoracic <b>contusive</b> spinal cord injury (SCI) in mice. In vivo imaging was performed prior to SCI, then again at 2 h, 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, and 30 days post-SCI using a Bruker 16. 4 T small animal nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer. Cross-sectional spinal cord areas were measured in axial slices and various DTI parameters, i. e. fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (lambda(parallel to)) and radial diffusivity (lambda(perpendicular to)), were calculated for the total spared white matter (WM), ventral funiculi (VF), lateral funiculi (LF) and dorsal columns (DCs) and then correlated with histopathology. Cross-sectional area measurements revealed significant atrophy (32 % reduction) of the injured spinal cord at the lesion epicentre in the chronic phase of injury. Analysis of diffusion tensor parameters further showed that tissue integrity was most severely affected in the DCs, i. e. the site of immediate impact, which demonstrated a rapid and permanent decrease in FA and lambda(parallel to). In contrast, DTI parameters for the ventrolateral white matter changed more gradually with time, suggesting that these regions are undergoing more delayed degeneration {{in a manner that}} may be amenable to therapeutic intervention. Of all the DTI parameters, lambda(perpendicular to) was most closely correlated to myelin content whereas changes in FA and lambda(parallel to) appeared more indicative of axonal integrity, Wallerian degeneration and associated presence of macrophages. We conclude that longitudinal DTI at 16. 4 T provides a clinically relevant, objective measure for assessing white matter pathology following <b>contusive</b> SCI in mice that may aid the translation of putative neuroprotective strategies into the clinic.

40|$|SUMMARY We {{produced}} a standard experimental posterior contusion {{injury in the}} pig eye which resulted in immediate intraocular haemorrhage and retinal whitening and folding without {{the formation of a}} retinal break. When combined with a standard posterior penetrating eye injury, traction retinal detachment began to develop after 2 weeks. We recognised a period of transition between the resolution of the acute effects of contusion and the onset of fibrocellular proliferation resulting from ocular penetration. The damage from a penetrating eye injury results from a combination of the effects of contusion and laceration of ocular tissues. Posterior penetrating injuries with a major <b>contusive</b> component may result in far greater and more extensive damage than those with laceration alone. ' These injuries may be complicated by an indirect scleral rupture or by expulsive choroidal haemorrhage, with extrusion of intraocular contents. 2 Similarly haemorrhage, said to originate from engorged choroidal vessels, 3 may occur during early vitrectomy performed on severely injured eyes 4 with little indication preoperatively of the impending haemorrhage. Clinical impressions, however, suggest that intraoperative haemorrhage is less likely to occur if vitrectomy is delayed for several days or weeks after a severe injury. Previously developed experimental models of posterior penetrating injury have reproducibly resulted in vitreous traction and traction retinal detachment. 78 However, in these models ocular penetration was achieved with a surgical type incision only, and thus no <b>contusive</b> element, no choroidal haemorrhage, and no intraoperative haemorrhage from the uveal tract were encountered during subsequent vitrectomies. 9 '° In an attempt to achieve a greater degree of clinical relevance and the better to evaluate the timing of vitrectomy after severe eye injury we decided to investigate the role of contusion in posterior penetrating injuries. The {{purpose of this study was}} t...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — We {{describe}} {{the feasibility of}} using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) to study a <b>contusive</b> model of rat spinal cord injury following human stem cell transplantation at and around the site of injury. Rats receiving either a laminectomy or contusion injury were transplanted with oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). During {{the course of the}} study, bioluminescence imaging (BLI; up to 100 days) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs; up to 42 days) were used to evaluate cell survival and functional outcomes. Spinal cords were then analyzed ex vivo upon termination using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Improvements in fractional anisotropy (FA) at day 100 post-transplantation corresponded with cell survival and functional SSEP improvements. Thus, we illustrate the feasibility of DTI for evaluating axonal integrity in SCI after cell replacement therapies, and we provide examples utilizing OPC transplantations in a contusion rat model.

40|$|Axons fail to {{regenerate}} in the injured spinal cord, limiting motor and autonomic recovery {{and contributing to}} long-term morbidity. Endogenous inhibitors, including those on residual myelin, contribute to regeneration failure. One inhibitor, myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), binds to sialoglycans and other receptors on axons. MAG inhibition of axon outgrowth in some neurons is reversed by treatment with sialidase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes sialic acids and eliminates MAG–sialoglycan binding. We delivered recombinant sialidase intrathecally to rats following a spinal cord <b>contusive</b> injury. Sialidase (or saline solution) was infused to the injury site continuously for 2 wk and then motor behavior, autonomic physiology, and anatomic outcomes were determined 3 wk later. Sialidase treatment significantly enhanced hindlimb motor function, improved bulbospinally mediated autonomic reflexes, and increased axon sprouting. These findings validate sialoglycans as therapeutic targets and sialidase as a candidate therapy for spinal cord injury...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Contusive</b> {{spinal cord}} injury is {{complicated}} by a delayed loss of oligodendrocytes, resulting in chronic progressive demyelination. Therefore, transplantation strategies to provide oligodendrocyte lineage cells and to enhance the extent of myelination appear to be justified for spinal cord repair. The present study investigated whether transplantation of human neural stem cells (NSCs) genetically modified to express Olig 2 transcription factor, an essential regulator of oligodendrocyte development, can improve locomotor recovery and enhance myelination in a rat <b>contusive</b> {{spinal cord injury}} model. Results HB 1. F 3 (F 3) immortalized human NSC line was transduced with a retroviral vector encoding Olig 2, an essential regulator of oligodendrocyte development. Overexpression of Olig 2 in human NSCs (F 3. Olig 2) induced activation of NKX 2. 2 and directed differentiation of NSCs into oligodendrocyte lineage cells in vitro. Introduction of Olig 2 conferred higher proliferative activity, and a much larger number of F 3. Olig 2 NSCs were detected by 7 weeks after transplantation into contused spinal cord than that of parental F 3 NSCs. F 3. Olig 2 NSCs exhibited frequent migration towards the white matter, whereas F 3 NSCs were mostly confined to the gray matter or around the lesion cavities. Most of F 3. Olig 2 NSCs occupying the spared white matter differentiated into mature oligodendrocytes. Transplantation of F 3. Olig 2 NSCs increased the volume of spared white matter and reduced the cavity volume. Moreover, F 3. Olig 2 grafts significantly increased the thickness of myelin sheath around the axons in the spared white matter. Finally, animals with F 3. Olig 2 grafts showed an improvement {{in the quality of}} hindlimbs locomotion. Conclusion Transplantation of NSCs genetically modified to differentiate into an oligodendrocytic lineage may be an effective strategy to improve functional outcomes following spinal cord trauma. The present study suggests that molecular factors governing cell fate decisions can be manipulated to enhance reparative potential of the cell-based therapy. </p...|$|E
30|$|Trauma {{can be used}} {{to induce}} {{osteoarthritis}} in the medial femorotibial joint of horses. Bolam et al. characterized this method. A <b>contusive</b> impact is applied to the medial femoral condyle of horses and leads to the development of osteoarthritis within 56  days [56]. Repeated overloading is another way in which osteoarthritis can be induced in horses. Turley et al. described pathological changes in the joints of race horses as a result of years of training. Many of these horses had osteoarthritis as a result of constant heavy use of the joints. They found that these horses were useful models for studying the histo-pathology of OA and for observing pain behavior in response to the progression of OA [57]. Since horses are more anatomically similar to humans than many other animals, they are often used to confirm the efficacy of drugs and other therapeutic strategies before beginning clinical trials in humans.|$|E
30|$|The {{efficacy}} of programmes {{designed to enhance}} social and emotional development and improve behavioural and academic outcomes has been demonstrated (Durlak et al. 2011). Research findings suggested that children’s social-emotional learning can be achieved through effective teacher instruction, students’ engagement, parents’ participation, and community involvement in planning and implementing the programme in classrooms (Durlak et al. 2011; Greenberg et al. 2003). Teachers can also help children to identify their emotions so that children are able to re-evaluate their internal thinking and gain confidence and ultimate success in schools and becoming responsible citizens (Elias 2006; Kong 2011). For example, Elias identified teachers’ contributions {{to the development of}} emotional intelligence of students that may be <b>contusive</b> to the improvement of academic performance (Elias 2006). Hence, in addition to parents, teachers or early childhood educators {{play a significant role in}} the development of the emotional literacy in children.|$|E
40|$|Topiramate (TPM) is {{a widely}} used {{antiepileptic}} and antimigraine agent which {{has been shown to}} exert neuroprotective effects in various experimental traumatic brain injury and stroke models. However, its utility in spinal cord injury has not been studied extensively. Thus, we evaluated effects of TPM on secondary cellular injury mechanisms in an experimental rat model of traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). After rat models of thoracic <b>contusive</b> SCI were established by free weight-drop method, TPM (40 mg/kg) was given at 12 -hour intervals for four times orally. Post TPM treatment, malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl levels were significantly reduced and reduced glutathione levels were increased, while immunoreactivity for endothelial nitric oxide synthase, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1 was diminished in SCI rats. In addition, TPM treatment improved the functional recovery of SCI rats. This study suggests that administration of TPM exerts neuroprotective effects on SCI...|$|E
40|$|A 48 -year-old man {{presented}} with hyphema, iridocyclitis, iridophacodonesis, and maculopathy after a <b>contusive</b> trauma. Ultrasound biomicroscopy identified a 90 -degree cyclodialysis cleft with severe damage of the zonular fibers. Echographic B-scan examination revealed intravitreal hemorrhage and a 360 -degree choroidal detachment. One month later, phacoemulsification was performed and a single-piece poly(methyl methacrylate) intraocular lens was {{inserted into the}} ciliary sulcus, with the haptic rotated toward the cyclodialysis cleft area. Postoperatively, the visual acuity improved and the intraocular pressure returned to normal. Ultrasound biomicroscopy showed closure of the cleft by reattachment of the ciliary body to the scleral spur. Optical coherence tomography revealed complete resolution of the macular and choroidal folds. Ultrasound biomicroscopy is a useful method for appropriate management of traumatic cyclodialysis cleft. In cases of small cyclodialysis clefts, with the surgical method we describe, the lens haptics apply directional force toward the sclera, fostering adherence of the ciliary body fiber...|$|E
40|$|Although {{relatively}} {{little is known}} of the mechanisms involved in secondary axonal loss after spinal cord injury (SCI), recent data from in vitro models of white matter (WM) injury have implicated abnormal sodium influx as a key event. We hypothesized that blockade of sodium channels after SCI would reduce WM loss and long-term functional deficits. To test this hypothesis, a sufficient and safe dose (0. 15 nmol) of the potent Na � channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX) was determined through a dose– response study. We microinjected TTX or vehicle (VEH) into the injury site at 15 min after a standardized <b>contusive</b> SCI in the rat. Behavioral tests were performed 1 d after injury and weekly thereafter. Quantitative histopathology at 8 weeks postinjury showed that TTX treatment significantly reduced tissue loss at the injury site, with greater effect on sparing of WM than gray matter. TTX did not change the pattern of chronic histopatholog...|$|E
