50|$|The flight {{commands}} are duplicated, {{with the}} front seat's center stick, <b>throttle</b> <b>lever,</b> rudder pedals and brake pedals mechanically connected to the rear seat's. The rear stick and the <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> can be disassembled when carrying passenger(s).|$|R
50|$|The <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> {{assembly}} {{is often}} designed to incorporate high-pressure (HP) cock switches {{so that the}} pilot has instinctive control of the fuel supply to the engine. Microswitches {{are located in the}} throttle box so that the <b>throttle</b> <b>levers</b> actuate the switches to shut the valves when the levers are at their aft end of travel. Pushing the levers forward automatically operates the switches to open the fuel cocks, which remain open during the normal operating range of the levers. Two distinct actions are required to actuate the switches again. The <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> must be pulled back to its aft position and a mechanical latch operated, or a detent (hard point) overcome, to allow the lever to travel further and shut off the fuel valve.|$|R
50|$|The {{dual control}} <b>throttle</b> <b>levers</b> are {{situated}} between the legs, and pivot {{from side to}} side so can be folded out of the way making entry and exit of the aircraft easier.|$|R
50|$|The {{position}} of each lever {{can be described}} by the current angle indicated. This {{is referred to as}} the <b>Throttle</b> <b>Lever</b> Angle or TLA. The greater the TLA, the greater the engine thrust.|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{had been}} flown {{for a long}} time with a throttle problem. The pilots had a higher workload because they had to operate the <b>throttle</b> <b>levers</b> for the left and right engines independently.|$|R
50|$|The {{steering}} column {{passes through the}} straight dashboard and spark and <b>throttle</b> <b>levers</b> worked in sectors inside the wheel rim. All main bearing were lubricated by a force feed lubricator, located {{in front of the}} dashboard. Sight glasses were attached to the left-hand side of the engine.|$|R
50|$|After {{the second}} circuit Erich Warsitz set the He 178 {{up for the}} landing. The turbine responded to the <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> very obediently. Just above the ground he {{corrected}} the machine’s attitude, pulled off a perfect landing {{and came to a}} halt just short of the waters of the Warnow.|$|R
50|$|So for example, if the {{throttle}} valve is {{moved up to}} let more fuel in, it will mean that {{the throttle}} valve has moved into a position which allows more fuel to flow through {{and on the other}} side, the required pressure ports are opened to keep the pressure balance so that the <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> stays where it is.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{pneumatic}} {{die grinder}} throttles (also called triggers) feature a spring-loaded [...] "kickstand" [...] mechanism between the <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> {{and the body}} of the grinder. This prevents the throttle from opening (being pressed down towards {{the body of the}} grinder) without operator intervention and inhibits accidental activation. It is similar in principle to the safety catches used on many handguns.|$|R
2500|$|A miswired {{flight control}} system led to two minor {{injuries}} when the left nacelle struck the ground while the aircraft was hovering [...] in the air, causing it to bounce and catch fire on 11 June 1991. [...] The pilot, Grady Wilson, suspected {{that he may have}} accidentally set the <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> the opposite direction to that intended, exacerbating the crash if not causing it.|$|R
50|$|The 1904 {{model was}} a larger touring car. Equipped with a rear {{entrance}} tonneau body, it could seat 5 passengers and sold for US$3500. The vertically mounted water-cooled straight-4, {{situated at the}} front of the car, produced 24hp (17.9kW). A 3-speed sliding transmission was fitted. The channel steel-framed car weighed 2350lb (1066kg). This modern Système Panhard car had spark and <b>throttle</b> <b>levers</b> on steering wheel, a novelty at the time.|$|R
5000|$|... {{possibly}} small {{friction force}} {{needed to move}} the TCL, which makes any inadvertent movement of the <b>throttle</b> control <b>lever</b> easier ...|$|R
25|$|As {{he moved}} about the {{locomotive}} works of New England gathering experience and {{an eye for}} engineering detail, he also produced his first book, The <b>Throttle</b> <b>Lever.</b> Designed as {{an introduction to the}} steam locomotive, this became the standard U.S. textbook on building locomotives. It not only took Colburn, then not 20, deeper into the world of publishing, but also earned him wider respect amongst railroad men across America – locomotive builders and train operators.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the standard General Electric J79 jet engine, a Rocketdyne AR2-3 rocket engine was fitted {{at the base of}} the vertical fin. This engine burned a mixture of JP-4 jet fuel and 90% hydrogen peroxide oxidizer solution. The NF-104 carried enough oxidizer for approximately 100 seconds of rocket engine operation. The thrust level could be adjusted to maximum or approximately half power by the pilot using an additional <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> on the left side of the cockpit.|$|R
50|$|On August 11, 2010 fifteen {{people were}} injured as a train entered a curve at the park going between 12 and 17 mph, causing {{five of the six}} cars to tip over. An {{investigation}} determined the operator was not adequately trained in steam locomotive operation which resulted in confusion of the brake and <b>throttle</b> <b>levers.</b> The state fined Tiny Town $30,500 consisting of $1000 per incident the operator operated the train and $500 for not having documented training of emergency and safety procedures.|$|R
50|$|The {{hand-operated}} {{gear and}} rear-wheel brake controls {{are on the}} driver's right {{but there is a}} door for the driver which there was not on the 30-98 or 25. The spark and <b>throttle</b> <b>levers</b> are on the steering wheel together with an air lever working a valve in the induction pipe (after the throttle). There is also a mixture control (choke) on the dash. Gear and brake levers are well to hand. Accelerator and (transmission) brake pedals were set close together.|$|R
5|$|The {{propellers}} of a DC-6 {{are designed}} to provide reverse thrust after the aircraft touches down. The pilot then retards the <b>throttle</b> <b>levers</b> to a point below idle speed and that directs the electric mechanisms in the propeller hub to rotate the blades to a position in which they will provide reverse thrust. Should the pilot need to perform a go-around, he moves the thrust levers forward to a positive position again and that will produce forward thrust, enabling the pilot to execute a go-around maneuver.|$|R
50|$|Investigators {{inspected}} {{the wreckage of}} Flight 3130 and {{found that there was}} not a single indication of a rotation on the propeller during the crash. Further inspection on the wreckage revealed that the propeller, mixture and <b>throttle</b> <b>levers</b> were all the way back. This indicated that the engine might have not running at the time of the crash. The engine could have been shut down by Captain Abdul. There are three possibilities that caused the shutdown; those are engine fire, engine failure, or an emergency procedure.|$|R
50|$|The {{propellers}} of a DC-6 {{are designed}} to provide reverse thrust after the aircraft touches down. The pilot then retards the <b>throttle</b> <b>levers</b> to a point below idle speed and that directs the electric mechanisms in the propeller hub to rotate the blades to a position in which they will provide reverse thrust.

5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation found}} a {{simulated engine failure}} procedure was being conducted, which involved {{a member of the}} crew pulling back the <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> for engine No. 4 prior to taking off. Investigators found that if the <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> was pulled back too far, it would cause the propeller to reversea feature designed to slow the aircraft upon landing. Once the landing gear was raised, the crew would have to raise a metal flag in the cockpit to bring the propeller blades back into the correct position, since a safety device prevented electric power from operating the rotating mechanism at the roots of the blades unless the aircraft was on the ground or the flag was manually raised. The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) concluded one of the flight crew applied full power to No. 4 engine, thinking this would bring the aircraft out of the increasing bank. Because the blades were reversed and the flag was not raised, that increased the reverse thrust from No. 4 engine, causing the DC-6 to spiral out of control. Since the plane was so close to the ground, the suddenness of the bank and dive meant the flight crew had no chance to recover the aircraft before impact.|$|R
5000|$|HOTAS, {{an acronym}} of Hands On Throttle-And-Stick, {{is the name}} given {{to the concept of}} placing buttons and {{switches}} on the <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> and flight control stick in an aircraft's cockpit, allowing pilots to access vital cockpit functions and fly the aircraft without having to remove their hands from the throttle and flight controls. Application of the concept was pioneered with the Ferranti AIRPASS radar and gunsight control system used by the English Electric Lightning and is widely used on all modern fighter aircraft such as the F-16 Fighting Falcon, the A-10A/A-10C and others.|$|R
50|$|The AIRPASS {{system was}} {{announced}} in late June 1958 and the radar was carried by interceptor aircraft from the early 1960s. It was initially linked to the de Havilland Firestreak air-to-air missile. Also known as the Ferranti AI.23. AIRPASS was developed by Ferranti Ltd on Ferry Road in Edinburgh. It introduced the HOTAS (Hands On Throttle-And-Stick) system whereby the radar and gun sight controls were situated on the control column and <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> instead of elsewhere in the cockpit, {{eliminating the need for}} the pilot to take his hands off the controls while making an interception.|$|R
50|$|A Takeoff/Go-around switch (TO/GA) is {{a switch}} on the {{autothrottle}} of modern large aircraft, with two modes: takeoff (TO) and go-around (GA). The mode {{is dependent on the}} phase of flight; usually, on approach to land, the autopilot will be set to approach mode, therefore if the TO/GA switch is pressed it will activate the go-around mode of the autothrottle; conversely, when take-off is set on the autopilot, the switch activates take off mode of the autothrottle. On Boeing aircraft TO/GA modes are selected by a separate switch near the <b>throttle</b> <b>levers,</b> but on Airbus aircraft it is activated by pushing the thrust levers fully forward to the TO/GA detent.|$|R
50|$|The G-36A {{also had}} French {{instruments}} (with metric calibration), radio and gunsight. The throttle was modified {{to conform to}} French pre-war practice: the <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> was moved towards the pilot (i.e. backward) to increase engine power. The armament {{which was to be}} fitted in France was six 7.5 mm (.296 in) Darne machine guns (two in the fuselage and four in the wings). The first G-36A was flown on 11 May 1940. After France's defeat in the Battle of France, all contracts were taken over by Britain. The throttle was modified again, four 0.50 in (12.7 mm) guns were installed in the wings and most traces of the original ownership removed.|$|R
50|$|The {{supercharger}} {{was rather}} basic {{in the early}} models, using a single-stage two-speed design directly geared to the engine (unlike the DB 601's hydraulically clutched version) which led to rather limited altitude performance, in keeping with its intended medium-altitude usage. One key advancement was the Kommandogerät (command-device), a mechanical-hydraulic unit that automatically adjusted engine fuel flow, propeller pitch, supercharger setting, mixture and ignition timing {{in response to a}} single <b>throttle</b> <b>lever,</b> dramatically simplifying engine control. The Kommandogerät could be considered to be a precursor to the engine control units used for many vehicles' internal combustion engines of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.|$|R
5000|$|Power Console (PI-PD7) - An {{unreleased}} cockpit-sized controller that attaches {{onto the}} SuperGraph unit itself, connecting via the expansion port {{on the front}} side. The peripheral would've added numerous control options such as an eight-way joystick, four action buttons, a flight yoke with two triggers (one on each handle), a <b>throttle</b> <b>lever,</b> a jog dial, three mode switches, an LCD panel, an LED indicator, four additional controller ports and a numerical keypad. The Power Console {{was scheduled to be}} released in Spring 1990 with a suggested retail price of 59,800 yen, but was never released due to its high production cost and the poor sales of the SuperGrafx itself.|$|R
5000|$|Wolfgang Dallach's Sunrise, marketed ready-to-fly or {{in kit form}} by his WD Flugzeug Leichtbau (WDFL), was {{his first}} {{ultralight}} design. In Germany {{it was the first}} ultralight equipped with a four-stroke engine. The Sunrise is a tandem two-seater. Both seats are equipped with a <b>throttle</b> <b>lever,</b> rudder and control stick. Full engine control is available only from the rear seat. The fuselage is built from steel tubes and is fabric covered. The wing has a nose made of fiberglass [...] The main spar is built from CFK. The Sunrise has a fixed tailwheel undercarriage, with the mainwheels hinged from the fuselage on V-form, cross-connected struts. Some Sunrises have wheel fairings.|$|R
5000|$|... 22 June 2013 - {{collided}} with Manly Wharf after a malfunction of the <b>throttle</b> control <b>lever,</b> causing major {{damage to the}} bow above the waterline, {{as well as the}} timber arrester {{at the end of the}} wharf.|$|R
50|$|Peripherals {{specifically}} designed for use with driving simulations include RailDriver by US manufacturer P.I. Engineering. RailDriver is a programmable desktop cab controller with <b>throttle,</b> brake <b>lever</b> and switches designed to work with Trainz, TrainMaster, Microsoft Train Simulator and Rail Simulator.|$|R
5|$|The {{investigation}} {{concluded the}} accident sequence {{began when the}} check pilot, while the aircraft was on the ground, retarded the <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> for No. 4 engine past the idle position, and therefore reversed the propellers of that engine. Once the airplane took off and started banking to the right, {{it would have been}} a natural reaction for one of the flight crew to increase power to No. 4 engine, thinking that by doing so the engine would start producing positive thrust and the aircraft could be recovered. However, since the metal flag was not raised, there was no electrical power to the rotating mechanismsand increasing power to No. 4 engine would only have created more reverse thrust.|$|R
50|$|Dashpots are {{commonly}} used in dampers and shock absorbers. The hydraulic cylinder in an automobile shock absorber is a dashpot. They are also used on carburetors, where {{the return of the}} <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> is cushioned just before the throttle fully closes, then is allowed to fully close slowly to reduce emissions. The British SU carburettor's main piston carries a stepped needle. This needle is held in the fuel flow orifice. The manifold vacuum causes this piston to rise allowing more fuel into the airflow. The SU's dashpot has a fixed hydraulic piston, damping the main piston as it moves upward. A valve in the piston disables the damping as the main piston returns.|$|R
50|$|There {{are other}} ways of {{controlling}} fuel flow for example with the dash-pot <b>throttle</b> <b>lever.</b> The <b>throttle</b> has a gear which meshes with the control valve (like a rack and pinion) causing it to slide along a cylinder which has ports at various positions. Moving the throttle and hence sliding the valve along the cylinder, opens and closes these ports as designed. There are actually 2 valves viz. the throttle and the control valve. The control valve is used to control pressure {{on one side of}} the throttle valve such that it gives the right opposition to the throttle control pressure. It does this by controlling the fuel outlet from within the cylinder.|$|R
50|$|The {{investigation}} {{concluded the}} accident sequence {{began when the}} check pilot, while the aircraft was on the ground, retarded the <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> for No. 4 engine past the idle position, and therefore reversed the propellers of that engine. Once the airplane took off and started banking to the right, {{it would have been}} a natural reaction for one of the flight crew to increase power to No. 4 engine, thinking that by doing so the engine would start producing positive thrust and the aircraft could be recovered. However, since the metal flag was not raised, there was no electrical power to the rotating mechanisms - and increasing power to No. 4 engine would only have created more reverse thrust.|$|R
50|$|The {{safety system}} cable, {{responsible}} for pulling the power lever to the idle position, {{was no longer}} able to withstand the physical strain of being pulled one way by the actuator, while the copilot forced it the other way by pushing the <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> to the fully open position - the cable soon parted at a maintenance connection. With the lever no longer restrained by the safety system, the copilot continued to hold the right throttle fully open. The combination of the right engine at full thrust in reverse and the left engine still at normal forward take-off thrust caused the aircraft to roll violently to the right and descend into the ground.|$|R
5000|$|Power is {{supplied}} by two three-phase electric motors, each {{capable of providing}} [...] for take-off and [...] continuously, controlled together by a single <b>throttle</b> <b>lever.</b> These are mounted in the fuselage, with the four lithium batteries, storing a total energy of 36 kWh, just behind the cockpit at the centre of gravity. Several different propeller configurations have been considered, including a single nose mounted propeller or a single propeller mounted {{near the top of}} the vertical tail. The initial trials were made with twin, contra-rotating propellers on arms which fold forward out of the fuselage just behind the wing trailing edge. Doors ensure that the fuselage is aerodynamically clean with or without the deployment of the propellers.|$|R
50|$|Consequently, {{during the}} time the reverse thrust lever for the right engine was being moved forward (to reduce the reverse thrust), the {{airplane}} captain unintentionally moved the <b>throttle</b> control <b>lever</b> for the left engine forward (increasing forward thrust). The reverse thrust of the right engine was reduced by the pilot gradually up to the stowed position and remained in that position until the time of colliding with the barriers. The <b>throttle</b> control <b>lever</b> for the left engine was in the position corresponding to the forward thrust setting of roughly 60% of its full rated takeoff thrust, and remained in that position until the flight data recorder (FDR) stopped recording. The crew apparently did not notice the left engine’s increase in forward thrust.|$|R
