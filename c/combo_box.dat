50|$|UIA uses control {{patterns}} to represent common control behaviors. For example, the Invoke control pattern {{is used for}} controls that can be invoked (such as buttons) and the Scroll control pattern is used for controls that are scrollable viewports (such as list boxes, list views, or <b>combo</b> <b>boxes).</b> Because each control pattern represents a separate functionality, they can be combined to describe the full set of functionality supported by a particular control.|$|R
50|$|The Names for {{elements}} in an application are assigned {{in the code}} by the developer. Many objects such as icons, menus, check <b>boxes,</b> <b>combo</b> <b>boxes,</b> and other controls have labels that are displayed to users. Any label that is displayed to users on a control (e.g., a button) is the default for the object's name property. Ensure the Name of the object makes sense to a user and describes the control properly. The Name property must not include the control role or type information, such as button or list, or it will conflict with the text from the role property (acquired from GetRoleText function of MSAA API).|$|R

40|$|Recently, a {{prototype}} relational database {{system has been}} developed that has the capability of storing and querying analog and video information for interaction with data analysis applications [8]. The system provides for numerous querying categories via indexed meta-data using pre-filled, drop-own <b>combo</b> <b>boxes.</b> A shortcoming of the design is {{the growing number of}} categories that could in time become unmanageable. One {{purpose of this study was}} to explore a more flexible design that would reduce the number of categories for storing and querying the database. In this design, the user enters a compound, logical query statement with the desired keywords in addition to using the existing <b>combo</b> <b>boxes.</b> This proved to be a more efficient and flexible strategy for accommodating expanding search categories. Another purpose of this study was to add security features in accessing database information to restrict sharing of information about subject populations. This has become an important requirement in accessing subject information in research studies. To this end we have developed an easily reusable security hierarchy in which individual users and groups of users can be granted rights to objects of the system e. g., database tables or user interface tabs. The permissions granted to a user are dynamically updated by group permissions as the user joins or leaves these groups. The initial implementation of security features has proven to be efficiently handled by the interface. Thus, {{a prototype}} for a flexible and secure database querying capability has been implemented that can be scaled to meet the expanding needs of researchers...|$|R

We describe design guidelines for adding visual cues to common user interface widgets such as radio buttons, sliders, and <b>combo</b> <b>boxes</b> and contribute a general software framework for applying scented widgets within applications with minimal modifications to existing source code. We provide a number of example applications and describe a controlled experiment which finds that users exploring unfamiliar data make up to twice as many unique discoveries using widgets imbued with social navigation data. However, these differences equalize as familiarity with the data increases.

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} XML and software tools for its use, {{with an emphasis on}} XML editors. Based on the experience of two Bulgarian projects on preparing electronic descriptions of mediaeval manuscripts from the 1990 es, we define the following requirements to the editor used for manuscript cataloguing: minimum elements on the screen; arrangement of elements according to the practice in the subject domain; supplying default values whenever this is possible; supplying possible values in <b>combo</b> <b>boxes</b> whenever this is possible; and ease of data entry (in Bulgarian with possibility to enter mediaeval text fragments in Old Cyrillic). These requirements were taken into account {{for the development of a}} specialized editor, XEditMan, which is presented in the article. Currently, 200 descriptions of manuscripts are available which were entered and edited using XEditMan.

40|$|This fast {{abstract}} briefly discusses {{lessons learned}} {{in terms of}} how to overcome limitations of PDA devices, effectively capture requirements for mobile health application development and effectively reengineer a desktop application on PDA. The limitation of PDA devices includes: (1) small screen size, which limits text-based data entry, reporting and browsing; (2) limited storage space and slow processing, which requires effective and efficient coding generation; (3) security limitations and inadequate third party application support, which poses challenge for application development. The corresponding strategies addressing the above challenges are: (1) providing check box, radio button, drop down list, text field, <b>combo</b> <b>box</b> based data entry and minimize text-based data entry, such as text area; (2) allocating as much as possible data storage, communication and computation tasks to the desktop system and minimize the function PDA component needs to handle, store data in file instead of database on PDA; (3) carefully selecting the device and implementation platform that supports development. To maximize the usability of PDA-based health application, the solution to be implemented on PDA ideally should be data management tasks with minimum text-based data entry and high frequency of recording. Challenges and solutions for software reengineering from desktop system to PDA-based application is outlined based on one application developed for World Health Organisation. In this example, the complex task of communication among PDA-based application, desktop system and the existent desktop application EpiData is effectively handled through the utilisation of XML files. A dynamic tool 2 ̆ 7 Questionnaire Designer 2 ̆ 7 provides a completely dynamic user interface generation tool that could easily be handled by end user.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an exploration into factors influencing {{the interaction of}} cognitive processing with visual and motor skills during website use by older adults. Twenty-eight older adults and 18 younger adults completed an on-line air-ticketing search task. Quantitative and qualitative data was captured from multiple sources, and analysed {{from the perspective of}} cognitive load. Compared with the younger control group, older adults took significantly longer and made significantly more errors in reporting the results of the task. Although the mean duration of gaze down at the keyboard and notes was similar for both age groups, the mean duration of screen gaze was significantly longer for older than for younger participants. Older adults also logged a significantly higher number of gazes from keyboard to screen. Their longer task times were associated with actions that increase cognitive load by decreasing spatial and temporal contiguity of information. Unlike their younger counterparts, they did not glance rapidly between screen and keyboard, but focussed their gaze on the keyboard, checking their typing only when they had completed a form field. Accordingly, they typed into autocomplete <b>combo</b> <b>boxes,</b> ignoring preset options, with the unexpected consequence of more expensive fares and a smaller range of results. When participant background information was analysed, task time was correlated with less Internet experience as well as with age. Supported by observation and self-report which did not signal pronounced vision or motor problems, these results suggest that task times could be reduced through automation of repeatable user interface actions with practice, especially with training in screen glancing rather than gazing. Although the number of search reporting errors was correlated with age group and not experience, greater proficiency with the interface could possibly free cognitive resources for improved problem-solving...|$|R

40|$|Simulation” is a {{word that}} might be {{familiar}} to everybody. Its meaning is so expanded in all sectors (medicine, education, biology, engineering, psychology [...] .), that the introduction of this paperwork will mainly focus only on computer simulations subject. To better understand what a computer simulation is, the most suitable and simple definitions are below: “The technique of representing the real world by a computer program”; "a simulation should imitate the internal processes and not merely the results of the thing being simulated"; “is a technique to perform tests using a model written in software” Why do we use computer simulations? The answer to this question may seem very long, but the main reasons for using simulations are easy to find, although they depend on what area we are in: Business simulations: Modern business has to stay competitive by keeping development and training costs and times to a minimum, while still keeping high levels of quality for both. Modeling and simulation of systems can provide solutions for product development and personnel training without the costs usually associated with these. In other words: computer simulations save time and money, and they are as reliable as real world tests. Education simulations: They provide the students with one intermediate space, which joins the reality with the models or theories. In addition, simulations allow interactive manipulation of the models, that will facilitate the acquirement of knowledge of the students. Obviously the subject of this work is to program and to study an example of “educational simulation”. More specifically, the simulation we work on is an interactive simulation, which intends to provide the students with a tool they can play with. The students can better understand the mathematical model used to explain the phenomena under study, because they can check and observe, in an interactive way, the reality the model represents. Our Applet simulation is drawn on a 2 D projection of a 3 D interactive graph representing two plane waves, one electric and the other magnetic, with z axe as their direction of propagation.
