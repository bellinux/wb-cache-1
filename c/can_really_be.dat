5|$|The climax {{is reached}} on Dr. Impossible's island, as he {{attempts}} to start a controlled Ice Age, making him Earth's ruler and only source of energy. He almost succeeds, using the hammer formerly belonging to the supervillain The Pharaoh to defeat the New Champions. CoreFire suddenly returns but is also unsuccessful against Dr. Impossible. Lily, who had quit the team earlier, eventually returns and defeats Dr. Impossible. Lily reveals that she is actually Erica Lowenstein, Dr. Impossible's childhood crush before his transformation and frequent kidnapee when she was the girlfriend of CoreFire. In the final chapter, Dr. Impossible ponders what it truly means to conquer the world, and whether such a feat <b>can</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> achieved, as he prepares for yet another escape from custody to start the cycle all over again with a new plan.|$|E
5|$|Julius Seelye Bixler {{reviewed}} the book twice, in 1952 and 1953. In his first review {{he wrote that}} he believed Stace was trying to have his {{cake and eat it}} with regards to the truth of both naturalism and mysticism. Bixler also wonders whether the revelation of God <b>can</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> free of concepts and thus whether time and eternity are utterly unrelated as Stace maintains. He identifies points in Stace’s thought where there is continuity between these two states and mystical language does appear to refer to concepts. Finally he rejects the book’s analogy of mystical experience to the evocative power of art, maintaining that art must be somewhat related to logic. Nonetheless, Bixler does concur that the book is a fascinating confessio fidei and personal statement. A year later, he reviewed Time and Eternity alongside Religion and the Modern Mind. As well as reiterating the points he had made earlier, Bixler judges the second book more favourably and recommends reading the two together to better understand the problems they address.|$|E

25|$|There {{were three}} {{suggested}} reaction mechanisms of the Baeyer–Villiger oxidation {{that seemed to}} fit with observed reaction outcomes. These three reaction mechanisms <b>can</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> split into two pathways of peroxyacid attack - on either the oxygen or the carbon of the carbonyl group. Attack on oxygen could lead to two possible intermediates: Baeyer and Villiger suggested a dioxirane intermediate, while Georg Wittig and Gustav Pieper suggested a peroxide with no dioxirane formation. Carbon attack was suggested by Rudolf Criegee. In this pathway, the peracid attacks the carbonyl carbon, producing what {{is now known as}} the Criegee intermediate.|$|E
500|$|Shakespeare {{constantly}} {{reflects on}} the problem of synecdoche in his plays, a rhetorical term meaning [...] "the part representing the whole". For example, in Henry V, Shakespeare's has the Prologue beg forgiveness of the audience for attempting to portray an entire army with a few men, and for portraying so great a man as the King with a feeble actor. Shakespeare explores these same problems through Robin Starveling. The Mechanicals' decision to use Robin as moonlight in place of actual moonlight delves into the problem of synecdoche, of trying to represent something greater than yourself. Robin's standing there, attempting to be moonshine, does not make him so, even if he is holding a lantern to represent at least a part of the Moon. Similarly, Shakespeare seems to be arguing that no representation of anything in a play <b>can</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> completely real or truthful, no matter how hard its players may try. Rather than begging forgiveness of the viewer, he is exaggerating the problem for their entertainment.|$|E
500|$|Killer7 {{received}} divisive {{reviews and}} sparked debates about depictions {{of sex and}} violence in video games {{and the status of}} video games as art. James Mielke of 1UP.com likened the game's high-contrast art style to noir and neo-noir film such as Se7en. He found that despite poor pacing and stilted gameplay, the [...] "quirky scripting and edgy plot" [...] were strong draws, and called Killer7 one of [...] "most artfully designed footnotes in gaming history". Edge magazine's reviewers echoed this sentiment and predicted that the game would [...] " [...] for future creative leeway", crediting the director with an unwavering artistic vision. Eurogamer's Kristan Reed was keenly aware of the game's limited appeal, calling it [...] "a concept game, an arthouse game, a simple game, an often beautiful game, but most certainly never an everyman's game". Yahtzee Croshaw of The Escapist commends the game for [...] "showing exactly what can be done when you flaunt all established convention and just start exploring what <b>can</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> done with gaming as an art form".|$|E
