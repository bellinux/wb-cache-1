5|$|In 1967, Venera 4 found Venus's {{magnetic}} field {{to be much}} weaker than that of Earth. This {{magnetic field}} is induced by an interaction between the ionosphere and the solar wind, rather than by an internal dynamo as in the Earth's core.

5|$|Ganymede is the Solar System's largest {{moon and}} the Solar System's only known moon with a magnetosphere, {{but this does not}} shield it from <b>cosmic</b> <b>radiation</b> to a {{noteworthy}} degree, because it is overshadowed by Jupiter's magnetic field. Ganymede receives about 0.08Sv (8rem) of radiation per day. Callisto is farther from Jupiter's strong radiation belt and subject to only 0.0001Sv (0.01rem) a day. For comparison, the average amount of radiation taken on Earth by a living organism is about 0.0024Sv per year; the highest natural radiation levels on Earth are recorded around Ramsar hot springs at about 0.26Sv per year.|$|E

5|$|Kongsfjord Telemetry Station {{constituted}} one of {{the four}} initial ESTRACK ground stations which provided radio tracking and telemetry communication with ESRO's low Earth orbit satellites. The ground station communicated with the satellites in the 136–137MHz band. This was optimal for low-orbit satellites, allowed for a small antenna dish but gave a low bit rate. The various satellites using the facility conducted measurements of solar radiation, <b>cosmic</b> <b>radiation,</b> the polar ionosphere, and ionizing and dynamic effects regarding electric currents and magnetic disturbances.|$|E
5|$|Fungi have a {{worldwide}} distribution, and grow {{in a wide}} range of habitats, including extreme environments such as deserts or areas with high salt concentrations or ionizing radiation, as well as in deep sea sediments. Some can survive the intense UV and <b>cosmic</b> <b>radiation</b> encountered during space travel. Most grow in terrestrial environments, though several species live partly or solely in aquatic habitats, such as the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, a parasite that has been responsible for {{a worldwide}} decline in amphibian populations. This organism spends part of its life cycle as a motile zoospore, enabling it to propel itself through water and enter its amphibian host. Other examples of aquatic fungi include those living in hydrothermal areas of the ocean.|$|E
5|$|This large {{collection}} of meteorites allows {{a better understanding}} of the abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare meteorites have been found. Among these are pieces blasted off the Moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, particularly ALH84001 discovered by ANSMET, are at the centre of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on Mars. Because meteorites in space absorb and record <b>cosmic</b> <b>radiation,</b> the time elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies. The elapsed time since fall, or terrestrial residence age, of a meteorite represents more information that might be useful in environmental studies of Antarctic ice sheets.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Instead of the Big Bang model, which {{considers}} the <b>cosmic</b> background <b>radiation</b> (CBR) as the afterglow of the Big Bang, a Zero Point Field (ZPF) model is proposed, in which <b>cosmic</b> background <b>radiation</b> {{is generated by}} the Cherenkov effect from superluminal particle pairs created in a zero-point fluctuation of vacuum. The calculated result of CBR by this model shows the spectrum and the mass density of energy due to the Cherenkov radiation closely coincides with of the <b>cosmic</b> background <b>radiation</b> observed. Such a ZPF model eliminates any requirement for abstract notions such as dark energy and dark matter and leads to the much broader concept of an Infinite Holographic Universe...|$|R
5|$|In 1937, Wordie {{organised}} {{an expedition}} to North West Greenland to investigate <b>cosmic</b> <b>radiation</b> at high latitudes and great altitudes. He assembled a team of ten men, nine of whom were from Cambridge University, among them Lethbridge and two other archaeologists. Setting sail in June 1937, Lethbridge undertook excavations of Eskimo sites at Rhyder Island, Cary Island, North West Island, and Isbjörn Island. On returning home in October 1937, {{it was decided that}} various geographical features encountered would be named after team members, and thus two lakes on Baffin Island were named the Lethbridge Lakes. During the trip, Lethbridge became particularly interested in the design of Eskimo boats, resulting in the self-publication of his 11-page booklet, Umiak – the European Ancestry of the 'Women's Boat, in 1937. He followed this with a second book, The Fishermen of Durness (1938), in which he argued that a study of contemporary traditional fishing communities could inform archaeologists more about ancient boat-making and fishing.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of Project A119 remained largely secret until the mid-1990s, when writer Keay Davidson discovered the story while researching {{the life of}} Carl Sagan for a biography. Sagan's involvement with the project was apparent from his application for an academic scholarship at the University of California, Berkeley's Miller Institute in 1959. In the application, Sagan gave details of the project research, which Davidson felt constituted a violation of national security. The leak consisted of Sagan revealing the titles of two classified papers from the A119 project—the 1958 paper Possible Contribution of Lunar Nuclear Weapons Detonations to the Solution of Some Problems in Planetary Astronomy, and the 1959 paper Radiological Contamination of the Moon by Nuclear Weapons Detonations. A 1958 paper titled <b>Cosmic</b> <b>Radiation</b> and Lunar Radioactivity, credited to I. Filosofo, was also named by Sagan in a 1961 paper written for the United States National Research Council. These were among the eight reports created by the project, {{all of which were}} destroyed in 1987.|$|E
25|$|Even the hardiest cells known {{could not}} {{possibly}} survive the <b>cosmic</b> <b>radiation</b> near the surface of Mars since Mars lost its protective magnetosphere and atmosphere. After mapping <b>cosmic</b> <b>radiation</b> levels at various depths on Mars, researchers have concluded that over time, any life within the first several meters of the planet's surface would be killed by lethal doses of <b>cosmic</b> <b>radiation.</b> The team calculated that the cumulative damage to DNA and RNA by <b>cosmic</b> <b>radiation</b> would limit retrieving viable dormant cells on Mars to depths greater than 7.5 metres below the planet's surface.|$|E
