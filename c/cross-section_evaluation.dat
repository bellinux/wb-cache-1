40|$|Past {{efforts by}} the Department of Energy (DOE), the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and others have {{provided}} sufficient technical information to enable the NRC to issue regulatory guidance for implementation of pressurized-water reactor (PWR) burnup credit; however, consideration of only the reactivity change due to the major actinides is recommended in the guidance. Moreover, DOE, NRC, and EPRI have noted {{the need for additional}} scientific and technical data to justify expanding PWR burnup credit to include fission product (FP) nuclides and enable burnup credit implementation for boiling-water reactor (BWR) spent nuclear fuel (SNF). The criticality safety assessment needed for burnup credit applications will utilize computational analyses of packages containing SNF with FP nuclides. Over the years, significant efforts have been devoted to the nuclear data evaluation of major isotopes pertinent to reactor applications (i. e., uranium, plutonium, etc.); however, efforts to evaluate FP cross-section data in the resonance region have been less thorough relative to actinide data. In particular, resonance region cross-section measurements with corresponding R-matrix resonance analyses have not been performed for FP nuclides. Therefore, the objective of this work is to assess the status and performance of existing FP cross-section and cross-section uncertainty data in the resonance region for use in burnup credit analyses. Recommendations for new <b>cross-section</b> measurements and/or <b>evaluations</b> are made based on the data assessment. The assessment focuses on seven primary FP isotopes (103 Rh, 133 Cs, 143 Nd, 149 Sm, 151 Sm, 152 Sm, and 155 Gd) that impact reactivity analyses of transportation packages and two FP isotopes (153 Eu and 155 Eu) that impact prediction of 155 Gd concentrations. Much of the assessment work was completed in 2005, and the assessment focused on the latest FP <b>cross-section</b> <b>evaluations</b> available in the international nuclear data community as of March 2005. The accuracy of the cross-section data was investigated by comparing existing <b>cross-section</b> <b>evaluations</b> against available measured cross-section data. When possible, benchmark calculations were also used to assess the performance of the latest FP cross-section data. Since March 2005, the U. S. and European data projects have released newer versions of their respective data files. Although there have been updates to the international data files and to some degree FP data, much of the updates have included nuclear cross-section modeling improvements at energies above the resonance region. The one exception is improved ENDF/B-VII cross-section uncertainty data or covariance data for gadolinium isotopes. In particular, ENDF/B-VII includes improved 155 Gd resonance parameter covariance data, but they are based on previously measured resonance data. Although the new covariance data are available for 155 Gd, the conclusions of the FP cross-section data assessment of this report still hold in lieu of the newer international cross-section data files. Based on the FP data assessment, there is judged to be a need for new total and capture cross-section measurements and corresponding <b>cross-section</b> <b>evaluations,</b> in a prioritized manner, for the nine FPs to provide the improved information and technical rigor needed for criticality safety analyses...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Many older neutron <b>cross-section</b> <b>evaluations</b> from {{libraries}} such as ENDF/B-VI or JENDL- 3. 2 exhibit deficiencies or do {{not cover}} energy ranges that are important for criticality safety applications. These deficiencies may occur in the resolved and unresolved-resonance regions. Consequently, these evaluated data may not be adequate for nuclear criticality calculations where effects such as self-shielding, multiple scattering, or Doppler broadening are important. To support the Nuclear Criticality Predictability Program, neutron cross-section measurements have been initiated at the Oak Ridge Electron Linear Accelerator (ORELA). ORELA is the only high-power white neutron source with excellent time resolution still operating in the United States. It is ideally suited to measure fission, neutron total, and capture cross sections in the energy range from 1 eV to ~ 600 keV, which is important for many nuclear criticality safety applications...|$|R

The deadline for the retrieval of the experimental data was June 1994. The evaluated curves are presented by rational functions in the holw energy range of interest - from effective threshold to 20 MeV. The uncertainty of the evaluated cross-sections takes into account the bias (model error) of the rational function relative to the unknown hypothetical true dependence of the cross-section on energy. This bias was estimated as deviation of the rational functions from piecewise one calculated {{on the basis of the}} same experimental data base. The piecewise functions were extracted through updating of the IRDF- 90 evaluations within Bayesian technique by means of an extended version of the computer code GLUCS.

The measurements were done using a pulsed neutron source driven by an electron LINAC.

The neutron filter removes most of the neutrons at other energies and significantly attenuates the gamma background resulting in 20 energy windows and a high signal-to-background ratio.

40|$|A renewed {{assessment}} of the sodium void reactivity worth is being {{presented in this paper}} after new <b>cross-section</b> <b>evaluations</b> (JEFZ) l and computational methods (ECCO/ERANOS) 2, 3 have been established. The CIRAN 04 experimental programme, which provides the experimental data base for Plutonium Burning cores 5 (CAPRA design) is also a reason for such a renewed study. A detailed analysis of the experiments requires the use of transport theory with an accurate representation of anisotropic streaming and the use of perturbation theory for transport methods. This allows the separation of the global effect into a leakage term and a non-leakage term and the application of known method corrections (the anisotropy of streaming not yet implemented) to the determination of the leakage components. The discrepancies observed for the negative leakage term are important using the current computational scheme but {{it has been shown that}} it is caused by the existence of a strong anisotropy of streaming due to existing leakage corridors in the MASURCA lattice. The positive non-leakage term is sensitive to nuclear data and its prediction presents some small discrepancies in comparison with the experimental results.

The 81 -group library is shown to model HTGR cases with similar accuracy to the SCALE 238 -group library but with significantly faster computational times due to the reduced number of energy groups and the use of BONAMI-IR instead of BONAMI/CENTRM/PMC for resonance self-shielding calculations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} an effective numerical formulation for the analysis of steel-concrete composite structures considering geometric and materials nonlinear effects. Thus, a methodology based on Refined Plastic Hinge Method (RPHM) was developed and the stiffness parameters were obtained by homogenization of <b>cross-section.</b> The <b>evaluation</b> of structural elements strength is done through the Strain Compatibility Method (SCM). The Newton-Raphson Method with path-following strategies is adopted to solve nonlinear global and local (in cross-section level) equations. The results are compared with experimental and numerical database presents in literature and a good accuracy is observed in composite cross sections, composite columns, and composite portal frames...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Prediction of {{neutron flux}} at the {{irradiation}} devices {{of a research}} reactor facility {{is essential for the}} design and evaluation of experiments involving material irradiations. A computational model of the Greek Research Reactor (GRR- 1) was developed using the Monte Carlo code MCNP with continuous energy neutron <b>cross-section</b> data <b>evaluations</b> from ENDF/B-VI library. The model included detailed geometrical representation of the fuel and control assemblies, beryllium reflectors, irradiation devices and the graphite pile. The MCNP model was applied to predict neutron flux at the in-pool irradiation positions and the graphite pile. The MCNP estimated neutron fluxes were compared with measurements using activation foils and a good agreement between calculated and experimental results was observed...|$|R
40|$|Particle-Induced Gamma-ray Emission (PIGE) is a {{powerful}} analytical technique that exploits the interactions of rapid charged particles with nuclei located near a sample surface to determine the composition {{and structure of the}} surface regions of solids by measurement of characteristic prompt γ rays. The potential for depth profiling of this technique has long been recognized, however, the implementation has been limited owing to insufficient knowledge of the physical data and lack of suitable user-friendly computer codes for the applications. Although a considerable body of published data exists in the nuclear physics literature for nuclear reaction cross sections with γ rays in the exit channel, there is no up-to-date, comprehensive compilation specifically dedicated to IBA applications. A number of PIGE cross-section data had already been uploaded to the Ion Beam Analysis Nuclear Data Library (IBANDL) ([URL] by members of the IBA community by 2011, however a preliminary survey of this body of unevaluated experimental data has revealed numerous discrepancies beyond the uncertainty limits reported by the authors. Using the resources and coordination provided by the IAEA, a concerted effort to improve the situation was made within the Coordinated Research Project on the Development of a Reference Database for PIGE spectroscopy, from 2011 to 2015. The aim of the CRP was to create a data library for Ion Beam Analysis that contains reliable and usable data on charged particle γ-ray emission cross sections that would be made freely available to the user community. As the CRP has reached its completion, we shall present its main achievements, including the results of nuclear <b>cross-section</b> <b>evaluations</b> {{and the development of a}} computer code that will become available to the public allowing for the implementation of a standardless PIGE technique. © 2015 Elsevier B.

40|$|An {{efficient}} and reliable transport system for fast-neutron irradiations {{has been built}} at the Physics Department, Jyväskylä, Finland. It is constructed from commercial bicycle components and is driven by a computer-controlled stepping motor. It can be operated in single or cyclic mode. The neutron irradiated targets are moved within 1. 2 seconds (full stop to full stop) to a well-shielded position 3 meters away {{where they can be}} removed or directly investigated by γ spectroscopy. The system has been built with the aim to experimentally verify the calculated production rates of neutron-rich nuclei in the SPIRAL 2 uranium target. However, the facility can be used for various kinds of fast-neutron irradiations, with a neutron spectrum up to 60 MeV produced by stopping a deuteron beam of several μA in a thick target. Examples of applications are activation and integral <b>cross-section</b> measurements, <b>evaluation</b> of damages in materials and biological cells...|$|R
40|$|This work {{concerns}} {{evaluation of}} a numerical model of a scaled circulating fluidized bed, CFB, with a square <b>cross-section.</b> The <b>evaluation</b> consists of {{a comparison of the}} numerical results with measurements achieved with Laser Doppler Anemometry, LDA, and pressure taps. The CFB is fluidized using metal particles, which enable the lab-scale CFB to be operated under scaled conditions of a full-scale CFB. The numerical part is based on a 3 D multiphase Computational Fluid Dynamics, CFD, model that uses an Eulerian description for the gas and solid phases. The conservation equations for the solid phases are based on the kinetic theory for granular flow, which provide adequate modelling of the solid phase when using the Eulerian approach. Three-dimensional simulations is found to be superior to two-dimensional simulations when compared to the experimental findings. This manuscript is submitted for the special issue of IECR to be published in conjunction with the United Engineering Foundation-CRE VIII conference to be held June 23 - 29, 2001 in Barga, Ital...|$|R
