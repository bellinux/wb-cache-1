30|$|<b>Coronary</b> <b>arterial</b> {{calcification}} (CAC) is {{a marker}} {{of the burden of}} coronary artery atherosclerosis but its relationship to plaque instability is less predictable. <b>Coronary</b> <b>arterial</b> calcification can be an early indicator of coronary artery disease in asymptomatic individuals being worked up for surgery or other suspected chest pathology. Coronary artery disease was the most frequent cardiac finding on chest CT in prior studies with the left anterior descending coronary artery being the most frequently involved [6]. The same authors note that the presence of <b>coronary</b> <b>arterial</b> calcification was often not mentioned in chest CT reports [6]. <b>Coronary</b> <b>arterial</b> calcification can be easily seen even on non-ECG gated unenhanced CT. Radiologists interpreting chest CT should not only evaluate the anatomic origin of the coronary arteries but also evaluate for the extent and severity of <b>coronary</b> <b>arterial</b> disease. Patients with <b>coronary</b> <b>arterial</b> calcification have increased risk for cardiac events, including ischemia, arrhythmia, hypotension, myocardial infarction, <b>coronary</b> <b>arterial</b> intervention or surgery, and death.

40|$|ABSTRACT To {{investigate}} {{the action of}} calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) on human epicardi-al coronary arteries, six patients received intracoronary CGRP at doses of 50, 100, and 200 ng/min. The effect of CGRP was measured angiographically with a computerized analysis system. A dose-depen-dent increase in coronary arterial diameter was observed. At the highest dose there were 34 %, 7 %, 38 %, and 40 % mean increases in the diameters of the circumflex, proximal, mid, and distal left anterior descending arteries, respectively. No further increase in diameter was found after a subsequent dose of 1 mg intracoronary isosorbide dinitrate. Prior infusion ofCGRP did not prevent <b>coronary</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>spasm</b> induced by ergonovine in two patients with variant angina, but a subsequent bolus of CGRP partially relieved the spasm.

40|$|A {{review of}} 120 {{patients}} who had a discharge diagnosis of intermediate coronary syndrome showed 12 patients with documented transient ST elevation during spontaneous rest pain consistent with Prinzmetal's angina. Coronary arteriography showed severe proximal occlusive coronary atherosclerosis in nine of the patients, and normal or minimal disease in the other three patients. In two of these three, there was documented <b>coronary</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>spasm</b> with reproduction of symptoms during arteriography. Although a shorter history of chest pain, presence of an old myocardial infarction and a positive finding on electrocardiogram treadmill test tended to predict the patients with severe occlusive coronary artery disease, these methods were inadequate to select candidates for arteriography. All patients responded well to nitroglycerine while in the hospital. Five of the nine patients with coronary artery disease had coronary bypass operations, with two excellent, two fair and one poor result. One of the three patients with normal findings on coronary arteriograms died with refractory ventricular arrhythmia six months after study.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{quantify}} {{the effects of}} fenoldopam, 0. 1 microg/kg/min, on left internal mammary artery (LIMA) and saphenous vein blood flow after coronary anastomosis. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: University teaching hospital, single institution. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-one American Society of Anesthesiologists III patients undergoing elective coronary revascularization. INTERVENTIONS: A perivascular ultrasonic flow probe (Linton Instrumentation, Norfolk, UK) was placed around the LIMA and saphenous vein graft after coronary anastomosis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Immediately before and at 5 -minute intervals for 15 minutes after starting the infusion, blood flow was measured in the LIMA and one saphenous vein graft using a transit time ultrasonic flow probe. Heart rate, blood pressure, and central venous pressure were documented at these time points. Administration of fenoldopam, 0. 1 microg/kg/min, did not alter heart rate or blood pressure. A small, nonsignificant increase in LIMA blood flow occurred during the 15 -minute study period (30 +/- 12 to 35 +/- 10 mL/min) in patients who received fenoldopam. No significant changes occurred in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that fenoldopam, 0. 1 microg/kg/min, did not influence coronary conduit blood flow to a clinically significant extent.

40|$|In case of subarachnoid {{hemorrhage}} due to rupture of the intracranial aneurysm, the most important. factor {{which has the}} strongest influence on the prognosis of life and prognosis of brain function is cerebral <b>arterial</b> <b>spasm.</b> Hitherto, various workers have carried out studies on cerebral <b>arterial</b> <b>spasm</b> {{based on the assumption}} that the <b>arterial</b> <b>spasm</b> are that of the smooth muscle of cerebral arterial wall. As to whether the <b>arterial</b> <b>spasm</b> is actually the true spasm of the smooth muscle of the cerebral arterial wall or not and in addition as to whether the early phase or late phase of spasm of the cerebral artery is actually a spasm of the smooth muscle of cerebral arterial wall or not has not been clarified. Thus in the present paper the author has attempted to clarify or otherwise elucidate such true basic problems related to the <b>arterial</b> <b>spasm</b> and has obtained the following findings. 1. It has clearly recognized that decreasing of diameter of basilar artery was observed in two phases in experimentally induced subarachnoid bleeding. The early phase appeared 3 minutes after the induction of hemorrhage and continued for 30 minutes. The late phase appeared one hour after the induction of the hemorrhage. 2. It was noted that no electrical activity was recorded in intact basilar arteries. However, following intravenous injection of epinephrine electrical activity of the arterial muscle was induced. 3. It has also noted that during the entire course of the early phase of the basilar <b>arterial</b> <b>spasm,</b> an intense electrical activity of the basilar artery wall was recorded. The onset of the electrical activity coincided with that of <b>arterial</b> <b>spasm.</b> 4. It has further noted that in the late phase of basilar <b>arterial</b> <b>spasm</b> no electrical activity of the arterial wall was seen. Even when electrical activity was recognized this was limited to the earliest part of the late phase, and moreover the electrical activity was of a low potential. During the late phase even when epinephrine was administered intravenously electrical activity of the arterial wall could not be induced. 5. In experimentally induced {{subarachnoid hemorrhage}} the electrical activity of the basilar artery muscle wall may be divided into 5 types in accordance with its appearance and continuance of the electrical activity. 6. The inner and outer diameter of the basilar artery was measured and from the difference between the two, the thickness of the basilar artery wall was calculated. According to this in the early phase a temporary thickening of the arterial wall was present. However, in the late phase it was shown that the thickness of the arterial wall progressively increases. 7. The early phase of the cerebral <b>arterial</b> <b>spasm</b> following subarachnoid hemorrhage is the period in which a functional contraction of the basilar artery smooth muscle is seen while that of the late phase is not a functional contraction of the arterial wall smooth muscle. And is rather became hypoxia arising in the cerebral arterial wall in the early phase gives rise to histological changes in the arterial wall which brings about a thickening of the wall as the period of anatomical stenosis...|$|R

40|$|In a {{detailed}} study of the <b>coronary</b> <b>arterial</b> tree and myocardium in 256 stillbirths and infants, abnormalities of the <b>coronary</b> <b>arterial</b> tree were noticed in 79 infants, and necrotic lesions of the myocardium in 111 infants. Of the 79 infants with arterial lesions, 70 had associated myocardial necrosis or scarring, or both; the group with <b>coronary</b> <b>arterial</b> lesions, therefore, accounted {{for the majority of}} cases with myocardial damage. The myocardial lesions varied from small zones of subendocardial damage, to larger 'geographical' zones of necrosis scattered haphazardly through the myocardium, and a small group where massive necrotic lesions of the papillary muscles were present. While the <b>coronary</b> <b>arterial</b> lesions were associated with all three patterns, they were particularly found in association with the 'geographical' and papillary muscle changes.

The <b>coronary</b> <b>arterial</b> lesions were seen most commonly in association with conditions that could produce severe hypoxia, and it is argued that they result from hypoxia. It is suggested further that the myocardial damage, so commonly associated with the <b>coronary</b> <b>arterial</b> lesions, could compromise the ability of the hypoxic infant to respond to such an insult. The <b>coronary</b> <b>arterial</b> lesions seen in this group of young infants could offer one explanation for the later development of a variety of other pathological conditions seen in adolescents and young adults...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Changes in {{coronary}} artery tone are often neglected in the angiographic assessment of patients with chest pain. To determine the contributions of dynamic {{coronary artery}} diameter changes {{to the degree of}} coronary narrowing, 47 consecutive chest pain patients were studied without pre-medication by analysing selective coronary angiograms before and after glyceryl trinitrate. Proximal coronary diameters were measured in superimposed frames with callipers. Lumen diameter increased after glyceryl trinitrate 15 ± 2 per cent in the left main, 18 ± 2 per cent in the left anterior descending, 16 + 2 per cent in the circumflex, and 17 ± 2 per cent in the right coronary arteries (all P 90 per cent were excluded because ofmeasurement inaccuracy). Of 81 narrowings 50 per cent because of dilatation of the adjacent region. However, the diameter of the nar-rowed segment also changed significantly after glyceryl trinitrate, increasing in 28 and decreasing in 3. Of the 28 obstructions which dilated after glyceryl trinitrate, 4 were clinical and angiographic examples of <b>coronary</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>spasm.</b> In 4 other coronary arteries with only outline irregularities before glyceryl trinitrate a localised narrowing (25 to 50 %) was seen after glyceryl trinitrate as the proximal artery dilated.

40|$|SUMMARY Changes in {{coronary}} arterial size due to {{ergonovine maleate}} are described and quantitated in 90 patients- 18 with typical angina pectoris, 56 with atypical chest pain, nine with variant angina pectoris, and seven heart transplant (allograft) recipients. We observed two angiographic {{changes in the}} diameter of cor-onary arteries: 1) spasm, which was characterized by occlusion or marked (> 85 %) focal or diffuse vessel narrowing, or 2) relatively mild and diffuse vessel narrowing, which was interpreted as the normal phar-macologic response to the drug. Serial bolus injections of 0. 05 mg, 0. 10 mg and 0. 25 mg of ergonovine maleate produced diffuse narrowing of the diameter of coronary arteries of 10 ± 1. 5 %, 16 ± 1. 4 % and 20 ± 1. 3 % (mean ± SEM), respectively, in the 72 patients with anginal syndromes who did not develop coronary spasm. The degree of coronary arterial narrowing was the same in heart transplant recipients and in patients with nor-mally innervated hearts who did not develop coronary spasm. We believe the normal pharmacologic response to ergonovine maleate was due to a direct vasoconstrictor action of the drug; this action was independent of neural control extrinsic to the heart. <b>CORONARY</b> <b>ARTERIAL</b> <b>SPASM</b> is recognized {{as a cause of}} angina pectoris.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} selective activation of H 1 receptors on coronary hemodynamics in 16 patients divided into two groups: group A, 11 patients with atypical angina or valvular heart disease and normal coronary arteries, and group B, five patients with spontaneous angina, four of whom had significant (greater than 70 % stenosis) coronary artery disease and one with normal coronaries. Selective H 1 receptor stimulation was achieved by infusing 0. 5 microgram/kg/min of histamine intravenously for 5 min after pretreatment with cimetidine (25 mg/kg). Heart rate was maintained constant (100 beats/min) by coronary sinus pacing and coronary blood flow (CBF) was measured by thermodilution. In group A, during histamine infusion mean aortic pressure fell from 99 +/- 5 to 77 +/- 4 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM, p less than. 001), coronary vascular resistance (CVR) decreased from 1. 07 +/- 0. 17 to 0. 82 +/- 0. 14 mm Hg/ml/min (p less than. 02), and CBF and myocardial oxygen consumption remained unchanged. None of the patients in this subgroup developed angina during histamine infusion. In group B, while no significant average changes in mean arterial pressure, CVR, or CBF were observed, {{two of the five}} patients (40 %) developed angina during histamine infusion, accompanied by ST-T elevation, a decrease in CBF, and an increase in CVR. In one of these two patients circumflex <b>coronary</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>spasm</b> was angiographically demonstrated during histamine-induced angina.

There were six deaths, and five of these patients had consistently abnormal ECGs. Analysis of the abnormal components of ECGs revealed that the presence of either a pathological Q wave or a raised S-T segment indicated a poor prognosis. The two patients with pathological Q waves both died, and the three patients with raised S-T segments all developed cerebral <b>arterial</b> <b>spasm,</b> one of whom died. A high incidence of peaked P waves, short P-R intervals, a long Q-Tc, and tall U waves occurred in the ECGs of six patients who died, the 15 patients with cerebral <b>arterial</b> <b>spasm,</b> and the seven patients who were later to develop cerebral <b>arterial</b> <b>spasm.</b> Three of the latter eventually died, in contrast with the single death in the 22 patients who did not develop cerebral <b>arterial</b> <b>spasm</b> and had a low incidence of P wave peaking, short P-R intervals, a long Q-Tc, and tall U waves.

40|$|A constant-flow {{preparation}} {{was used}} to assess <b>coronary</b> <b>arterial</b> resistance while activating pulmonary C fibres in chloralose-anaesthetized dogs. A Gregg cannula was passed through the left common carotid artery until the tip fitted snugly in the left circumflex coronary artery. The cannula was perfused with blood from the left femoral artery and blood flow through the cannula was maintained constant with a perfusion pump. Perfusion pressure in the coronary artery was measured from a side arm in the cannula, and resistance in that vessel was calculated as the ratio of pressure to blood flow. Capsaicin (10 - 20 micrograms/kg), injected into the right jugular vein, produced significant (P less than 0. 05) decreases in heart rate, systemic <b>arterial</b> pressure, <b>coronary</b> <b>arterial</b> pressure and <b>coronary</b> <b>arterial</b> resistance. These responses were abolished by bilateral vagotomy. Neither left atrial injections of capsaicin nor acutely decreasing the systemic arterial pressure by occluding the inferior vena cava had a significant effect on the <b>coronary</b> <b>arterial</b> pressure or resistance. Additionally, overdrive pacing of the heart had no effect on the reflex decreases in <b>coronary</b> <b>arterial</b> pressure and resistance that were evoked when capsaicin was injected into the jugular vein. alpha-Adrenergic blockade reduced the reflex decrease in <b>coronary</b> <b>arterial</b> pressure and resistance evoked by capsaicin by 31 and 38 %, respectively.
