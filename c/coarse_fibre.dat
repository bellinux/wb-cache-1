Mature spermatozoa are composed of an acrosomal vesicle, helical nucleus, elongate midpiece, annulus, glycogen piece and short end piece.

Anterior extensions of the mitochondrial sheath and banded helix form a double sheath around the basal half of the nucleus-an arrangement possibly unique in the Mollusca.

The <b>coarse</b> <b>fibres</b> and banded helix of the midpiece probably are derived through centriolar activity.

60|$|Beginning, then, {{with the}} fall of the nut from the parent-tree, the {{troubles}} of the future palm confront it at once {{in the shape of the}} nut-eating crab. This evil-disposed crustacean is common around the sea-coast of the eastern tropical islands, which is also the region mainly affected by the coco-nut palm; for coco-nuts are essentially shore-loving trees, and thrive best in the immediate neighbourhood of the sea. Among the fallen nuts, the clumsy-looking thief of a crab (his appropriate Latin name is Birgus latro) makes great and dreaded havoc. To assist him in his unlawful object he has developed a pair of front legs, with specially strong and heavy claws, supplemented by a last or tail-end pair armed only with very narrow and slender pincers. He subsists entirely upon a coco-nut diet. Setting to work upon a big fallen nut--with the husk on, coco-nuts measure in the raw state about twelve inches the long way--he tears off all the <b>coarse</b> <b>fibre</b> bit by bit, and gets down at last to the hard shell. Then he hammers away with his heavy claw on the softest eye-hole till he has pounded an opening right through it. This done he twists round his body so as to turn his back upon the coco-nut he is operating upon (crabs are never famous either for good manners or gracefulness) and proceeds awkwardly but effectually to extract all the white kernel or pulp through the breach with his narrow pair of hind pincers. Like man, too, the robber-crab knows the value of the outer husk as well as of the eatable nut itself, for he collects the fibre in surprising quantities to line his burrow, and lies upon it, the clumsy sybarite, for a luxurious couch. Alas, however, for the helplessness of crabs, and the rapacity and cunning of all-appropriating man! The spoil-sport Malay digs up the nest for the sake of the fibre it contains, which spares him the trouble of picking junk on his own account, and then he eats the industrious crab who has laid it all up, while he melts down the great lump of fat under the robber's capacious tail, and sometimes gets from it as much as a good quart of what may be practically considered as limpid coco-nut oil. Sic vos non vobis is certainly the melancholy refrain of all natural history. The coco-nut palm intends the oil for the nourishment of its own seedling; the crab feloniously appropriates it and stores it up under his capacious tail for future personal use; the Malay steals it again from the thief for his own purposes; and ten to one the Dutch or English merchant beguiles it from him with sized calico or poisoned rum, and transmits it to Europe, where it serves to lighten our nights and assist at our matutinal tub, to point a moral and adorn the present tale.|$|E

40|$|Fiber {{thermomechanical}} refining is {{a critical}} step for the manufacturing of medium density fiberboard (MDF). To increase productivity and improve fiber quality with a reduction in energy consumption during refining, {{it is essential to}} determine appropriate refining conditions, such as the chips retention time (accumulated chip height, CH) in the pre-heater, feeding screw revolution speed (SR) in the chip feeding pipe, and the opening ratio of the discharge valve (OV) in the discharge pipe. Using multiple regression analysis, relationships between the response variables (the total fibers, the specific energy consumption obtained by the motor power consumption/the total amount of dry fibers, and the percentage of qualified fibers) and the predictor variables (OV, CH, and SR) were modeled. Specific energy consumption decreased with an increase in CH. When more chips were stored in the pre-heater, the chips were softened by the extended steam-treatment time, reducing the energy consumption. There were negative relationships between the percentage of qualified fibers and the predictor variables (OV and SR). It was reasoned that a greater proportion of <b>coarse</b> <b>fibre</b> was produced when the discharge valve opening ratio or the feeding screw speed increased. This resulted in a reduction in the percentage of qualified fibers.

40|$|The {{formation}} {{and development of}} the ostrich sperm tail follows the general pattern described for vertebrate sperm but differs in a number of important aspects when compared with other nonpasserine birds. Midpiece formation is characterised by the development of a long (3 microns) distal centriole which determines the length of the midpiece. The distal centriole surrounds a pair of microtubules embedded in a core of dense material. A prominent annulus, which remains stationary during spermiogenesis, demarcates the midpiece/principal piece junction. Ostrich spermatids display similar cytoplasmic densities (chromatoid body, annulus, granulated bodies, reticulated bodies and mitochondria-associated material) to those observed in mammalian spermatids. In the ostrich, however, the chromatoid body is not observed to contribute towards the formation of the annulus while the granulated bodies develop within radial bodies and not in their vicinity as in mammals. Whereas in mammals granulated bodies have been linked to <b>coarse</b> <b>fibre</b> formation they appear to perform a limited function in ostrich spermatids as only rudimentary outer dense fibres are formed. No specific role is attributed to the reticulated bodies but the mitochondria associated material is implicated in the formation of intermitochondrial cement. The formation of the principal piece and end piece of the flagellum is modelled on that of the mammalian spermatid. The axoneme emerges from the free end of the distal centriole and the ribs and longitudinal columns are progressively formed from a layer of amorphous material situated between the axoneme and the plasmalemma. The end piece is formed by an extension of the principal piece consisting of axonemal microtubules closely surrounded by the plasmalemma. The formation of a long distal centriole containing a central pair of microtubules, the stationary nature of the annulus and the presence of a ribbed fibrous sheath around the principal piece distinguishes spermiogenesis in the ostrich and rhea from that of other nonpasserine birds. These features appear to be characteristic of more primitive avian families...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} twenty years, {{kangaroo}} harvesting has gained much greater public acceptance and risen in monetary value. However, most landholders still regard kangaroos mainly as pests, and are {{a long way from}} making enough money from kangaroos to encourage any shift away from their focus on sheep. Yet kangaroo meat is now sold legally for human consumption in all Australian States and is common on restaurant menus, while its export is rising steadily. Extensive aerial surveys have established the abundance of the three large kangaroo species and their resilience to harvesting. A small number of landholders are benefiting from kangaroos, either by selling access to shooters/processors or through direct involvement as licensed operators. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature has supported the concept of achieving conservation benefits from the sustainable use of wildlife, and this has been incorporated into kangaroo management programs (for leather and meat) by most Australian governments. Despite all these positives, the low price of kangaroo meat, which has still not found the place it deserves on the international game meat market, is a major impediment to implementing "sheep replacement therapy for rangelands", and only when prices rise significantly will landholders choose to reduce sheep numbers and invest their hopes in kangaroos. Meanwhile, land degradation continues unabated and low prices for <b>coarse</b> <b>fibre</b> wool, while encouraging woolgrowers in the sheep rangelands to overstock, also provide a stimulus to landholders to diversify. Alarmingly, many landholders are choosing to diversify into goats which, though profitable in the short term, will extend the damage done by sheep. Low prices for wool from the sheep rangelands also amplify the clamour for kangaroo control, and governments are responding by researching or implementing programs designed to significantly reduce kangaroo numbers. South Australia now has a program which, if implemented fully, would reduce kangaroos by 60 %. In Queensland and NSW, research projects are examining more effective ways to reduce kangaroo numbers. These goals reflect an acceptance of the folklore that competition from kangaroos compromises wool production and markedly reduces sheep carrying capacity, even though scientific evidence for this is lacking. But reducing kangaroos will not bring the anticipated benefits to woolgrowers, because kangaroos at typical densities are a much smaller component of the total grazing pressure (TGP) than is generally assumed. This is because the factor of 0. 7 DSE (dry sheep equivalent), by which kangaroo numbers are translated into forage lost to sheep, is an overestimate. Taking body weights into account the factor should be about 0. 4 and, taking measurements of field metabolic rate into account, may be as low as 0. 15 - 0. 2. Hence, even if the desired reductions in kangaroos could be achieved, there would be little or no difference to the economic viability of woolgrowers in the sheep rangelands. Furthermore, if governments decide to institute significant reductions in kangaroos without data to confirm the conservation and economic benefits of doing so, there will probably be strong criticism from conservation and animal rights organisations as well as from Australians at large, and this approach may have to be abandoned. For these reasons, the focus of kangaroo management as pest control aimed at improving wool productivity is doomed to failure. I still support the alternative view {{that the best way to}} reduce grazing pressure on the rangelands is by reducing sheep, and that the best way to achieve this is to develop a market for a high-value kangaroo industry and to sell its monopoly product on the world market for game meat. A significant increase in the value of kangaroo meat could make the harvest of free-range kangaroos for skins and meat a profitable and ecologically desirable enterprise for landholders. This would harness economic incentives in the service of ecological sustainability and rangeland rehabilitation and thus provide another example of achieving conservation goals through the sustainable use of wildlife. Furthermore, the development of a high value, sustainable kangaroo industry stands in sharp contrast to the fatalism of some ecological commentators who can only prescribe mass closure of Australian rural communities and essentially evacuating marginal country. What is needed to achieve these desirable social, economic and conservation goals is a strong marketing effort and I provide some suggestions about the attributes of kangaroo meat and the benefits of kangaroo harvesting which could feature in a marketing campaign...|$|E
