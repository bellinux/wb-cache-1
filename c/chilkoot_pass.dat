5|$|As on the White Pass trail, {{supplies}} {{needed to}} {{be broken down into}} smaller packages and carried in relay. Packers, prepared to carry supplies for cash, were available along the route but would charge up to $1 ($27) per lb (0.45kg) on the later stages; many of these packers were natives: Tlingits or, less commonly, Tagish. Avalanches were common in the mountains and, on April 3, 1898, one claimed the lives of more than 60 people travelling over <b>Chilkoot</b> <b>Pass.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some stampeders were famous: John McGraw, {{the former}} {{governor}} of Washington joined, together with the prominent lawyer and sportsman A. Balliot. Frederick Burnham, a well-known American scout and explorer, arrived from Africa, only to be called back {{to take part in the}} Second Boer War. Among those who documented the rush were the Swedish-born photographer Eric Hegg, who took some of the iconic pictures of <b>Chilkoot</b> <b>Pass,</b> and reporter Tappan Adney, who afterwards wrote a first-hand history of the stampede. Jack London, later a famous American writer, left to seek for gold but made his money during the rush mostly by working for prospectors.|$|E
5|$|The {{photographs}} {{taken during the}} Klondike gold rush heavily influenced later cultural approaches to the stampede. The gold rush was vividly recorded by several early photographers, for instance Eric Hegg; these stark, black-and-white photographs showing the ascent of the <b>Chilkoot</b> <b>pass</b> rapidly became iconic images and were widely distributed. These pictures in turn inspired Charlie Chaplin to make The Gold Rush, a silent movie, which uses {{the background of the}} Klondike to combine physical comedy with its character's desperate battle for survival in the harsh conditions of the stampede. The photographs reappear in the documentary City of Gold from 1957 which, narrated by Pierre Berton, won prizes for pioneering the incorporation of still images into documentary film-making. The Klondike gold rush, however, has not been widely covered in later fictional films; even The Far Country, a Western from 1955 set in the Klondike, largely ignores the unique features of the gold rush in favour of a traditional Western plot. Indeed, much of the popular literature on the gold rush approaches the stampede simply as a final phase of the expansion of the American West, a perception critiqued by modern historians such as Charlene Porsild.|$|E
50|$|The {{discovery}} {{of gold in}} the Klondike in the late 1890s presented Steele with a new challenge. Although he campaigned unsuccessfully for the position of assistant commissioner in 1892, in January 1898 {{he was sent to}} succeed Charles Constantine as commissioner and to establish customs posts {{at the head of the}} White and <b>Chilkoot</b> <b>Passes,</b> and at Lake Bennett. He was noted for his hard line with the hundreds of unruly and independent-minded prospectors, many of them American. To help control the situation, he established the rule that no one would be allowed to enter the Yukon without a ton of goods to support themselves, thus preventing the entry of desperate and potentially unruly speculators and adventurers.|$|R
5|$|The North-West Mounted Police set up control posts at {{the borders}} of the Yukon Territory or, where that was disputed, at easily {{controlled}} points such as the <b>Chilkoot</b> and White <b>Passes.</b> These units were armed with Maxim guns. Their tasks included enforcing the rules requiring that travellers bring a year's supply of food with them to be allowed into the Yukon Territory, checking for illegal weapons, preventing the entry of criminals and enforcing customs duties.|$|R
50|$|It {{is not as}} high or glacial as the {{neighbouring}} areas of the Boundary Ranges, {{but it is very}} rugged with extreme variations in relief. Historically it is notable as the location of the network of valleys leading inland from the <b>Chilkoot</b> and White <b>Passes</b> from the Yukon Ports of Skagway and Haines, Alaska to the headwaters of the Yukon River, downstream from which prospectors voyaged to the legendary goldfields of the Klondike Gold Rush.|$|R
25|$|The {{line was}} born of the Klondike Gold Rush of 1897. The most popular route taken by prospectors to the gold fields in Dawson City was a treacherous route from the port in Skagway or Dyea, Alaska, across the {{mountains}} to the Canada–US border at the summit of the <b>Chilkoot</b> <b>Pass</b> or the White Pass. There, the prospectors were not allowed across by Canadian authorities unless they had sufficient gear for the winter, typically one ton of supplies. This usually required several trips across the passes. There was a need for better transportation than pack horses used over the White Pass or human portage over the <b>Chilkoot</b> <b>Pass.</b> This need generated numerous railroad schemes. In 1897, the Canadian government received 32 proposals for Yukon railroads, and most were never realized.|$|E
25|$|The prospectors' journey began {{for many}} when they climbed the {{mountains}} over the White Pass above Skagway and onward across the Canada–US border to Bennett Lake, {{or one of}} its neighboring lakes, where they built barges and floated down the Yukon River to the gold fields around Dawson City. Others disembarked at nearby Dyea, northwest of Skagway, and crossed northward on the <b>Chilkoot</b> <b>Pass,</b> an existing Tlingit trade route to reach the lakes. The Dyea route fell out of favor when larger ships began to arrive, as its harbor was too shallow for them except at high tide.|$|E
25|$|In 1898, a 14-mile, steam-operated {{aerial tramway}} was {{constructed}} up the Skagway {{side of the}} White Pass, easing the burden of those prospectors who could afford the fee to use it. The Chilkoot Trail tramways also began {{to operate in the}} <b>Chilkoot</b> <b>Pass</b> above Dyea. In 1896, before the Klondike gold rush had begun, a group of investors saw an opportunity for a railroad over that route. It was not until May 1898 that the White Pass and Yukon Route began laying narrow gauge railroad tracks in Skagway. The railroad depot was constructed between September and December 1898. This destroyed the viability of Dyea, as Skagway had both the deep-water port and the railroad.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, American prospectors began to spread into the area. Making deals with the Native Tlingit and Tagish tribes, the early prospectors opened the {{important}} routes of <b>Chilkoot</b> and White <b>Pass,</b> and reached the Yukon valley between 1870 and 1890. Here, they encountered the Hän people, semi-nomadic hunters and fishermen who lived along the Yukon and Klondike Rivers. The Hän did not appear to know about the extent of the gold deposits in the region.|$|R
50|$|Malnutrition {{was a large}} {{problem for}} the {{travelers}} on the <b>Chilkoot</b> and White <b>Pass</b> Trails, and many died from it. Sometimes people suffering from malnutrition ate {{the bodies of the}} dead horses left on the White Pass Trail, and became violently ill as a result. It was rumoured that a traveler had used his boots as a source of food by boiling them and drinking the broth after so he could eat something. Physical illness was not the only problem to plague the travelers, as many also went insane from the conditions along the trails. Historians have suggested that the high rate of mental problems recounted were caused by the poor diets of many travelers, added to what may have been poor condition before starting the trails. In addition, along the trail the only shelter against the sometimes -40 degree temperatures were thin tents.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the vernacular watercraft of the Klondike Gold Rush (1897 - 1900). Thousands of gold seekers {{from around the}} world reached the Klondike gold fields by traversing the <b>Chilkoot</b> and White <b>Pass</b> Trails, then building over 8, 000 wooden vessels, used to navigate Canada’s Upper Yukon River. Only a few remains of the gold rush flotilla have been found, and the vessels have thus far received little attention. Historical, archaeological, and photographic evidence have been used to identify the types of vessels built, their design and construction influences, and features that will help to identify and interpret future finds. The gold rush vessels are viewed as expressions of behavioral variants that illustrate the adaptation process of gold seekers en route to the mining frontier. Data have been collected from gold seeker narratives, government documents, archaeological reports, and archival photographs. This thesis contributes to a more in-depth understanding of the gold rush vernacular watercraft, and demonstrates that the gold seekers chose to build and use vessels that were suited to the natural and economic environments along the Chilkoot Trail. </p...|$|R
500|$|Entrepreneurs {{began to}} provide {{solutions}} as the winter progressed. Steps were {{cut into the}} ice at the <b>Chilkoot</b> <b>Pass</b> {{which could be used}} for a daily fee, this 1,500 step staircase becoming known as the [...] "Golden Steps". By December 1897, Archie Burns built a tramway up the final parts of the <b>Chilkoot</b> <b>Pass.</b> A horse at the bottom turned a wheel, which pulled a rope running to the top and back; freight was loaded on sledges pulled by the [...] rope. Five more tramways soon followed, one powered by a steam engine, charging between 8 and 30 cents ($2 and $8) per [...] An aerial tramway was built in the spring of 1898, able to move 9 tonnes [...] of goods an hour up to the summit.|$|E
500|$|Those who {{landed at}} Dyea, Skagway's {{neighbour}} [...] town, travelled [...] the Chilkoot Trail and crossed its pass to reach Lake Lindeman, which fed into Lake Bennett {{at the head}} of the Yukon River. The <b>Chilkoot</b> <b>Pass</b> was higher than the White Pass, but more used it: around 22,000 during the gold rush. The trail passed up through camps until it reached a flat ledge, just before the main ascent, which was too steep for animals. This location was known as the Scales, and was where goods were weighed before travellers officially entered Canada. The cold, the steepness and the weight of equipment made the climb extremely arduous and it could take a day to get to the top of the [...] high slope.|$|E
500|$|Despite his {{inability}} {{to raise funds for}} mining, Meeker was certain there was a way to make money from the gold rush. [...] He and Eliza Jane spent much of the winter of 1897–1898 drying vegetables, and Ezra Meeker departed for Skagway, Alaska, on March 20, 1898 with [...] of dried produce—Fred Meeker and his wife Clara were already across the border in what would soon be designated as the Yukon Territory. [...] The 67-year-old Meeker, with one business associate, climbed the steep <b>Chilkoot</b> <b>Pass.</b> [...] With thousands of others in boats and on rafts, he floated down the Yukon River once the ice broke up in late May, and sold his vegetables in two weeks in Dawson City. [...] He returned to Puyallup in July, only to set out again with more supplies the following month. [...] This time, he and his son-in-law, Roderick McDonald, opened a store, the Log Cabin Grocery, in Dawson City, and remained through the winter.|$|E
50|$|The head of Lynn Canal was {{the main}} gateway to the Yukon, and the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) sent a {{detachment}} to secure the location for Canada. This was based on Canada's assertion that that location was more than ten marine leagues from the sea, {{which was part of}} the 1825 boundary definition. A massive influx of American stampeders through Skagway very quickly forced the Canadian police to retreat. They set up posts on the desolate summits of <b>Chilkoot</b> and White <b>Passes,</b> complete with a mounted Gatling gun at each post. This was still disputed territory, as many Americans believed that the head of Lake Bennett, another 12 mi north, should be the location of the border. To back up the police in their sovereignty claim, the Canadian government also sent the Yukon Field Force, a 200-man Army unit, to the territory. The soldiers set up camp at Fort Selkirk so that they could be fairly quickly dispatched to deal with problems at either the coastal passes or the 141st Meridian.|$|R
2500|$|Mystery at <b>Chilkoot</b> <b>Pass</b> by Barbara Steiner (1897, Yukon Alaska) ...|$|E
2500|$|He left California in July and {{traveled}} by boat to Dyea, Alaska, where he landed and went inland. To reach the gold fields, {{he and his}} party transported their gear over the <b>Chilkoot</b> <b>Pass,</b> often carrying loads as heavy as [...] on their backs. They were successful in staking claims to eight gold mines along the Stewart River.|$|E
2500|$|By 1887, Moore {{joined the}} {{government}} survey party headed by William Ogilvie {{and showed them}} how to build and navigate a barge up the Yukon River. Once the party got to the <b>Chilkoot</b> <b>Pass,</b> Moore heard tales of another route to the Yukon and, with Skookum Jim, started up the Skagway River and went over the [...] long pass, meeting up with the Oglivie party at Bennett Lake. When Oglivie heard of this new route, he named it White Pass, after Thomas White, the Minister of the Interior.|$|E
2500|$|The {{discovery}} {{of gold in}} the Klondike in August, 1896, by Skookum Jim, Tagish Charlie and George Washington Carmack set off {{a major change in}} the historical patterns of the region. Early prospectors used the <b>Chilkoot</b> <b>Pass,</b> but by July 1897, crowds of neophyte stampeders had arrived via steamship and were camping at [...] "White Horse". By June 1898, there was a bottleneck of stampeders at Canyon City, many boats had been lost to the rapids as well as five people. Samuel Steele of the North-West Mounted Police said: [...] "why more casualties have not occurred is a mystery to me." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{two boys}} echoed their uncle's sentiment, {{with a deep}} feeling in their hearts which they never forgot. The summit of <b>Chilkoot</b> <b>Pass</b> had been reached at last.|$|E
60|$|His manner was so earnest, all {{promised to}} {{remember}} his words. Then {{the crowd of}} whites and Indians was gathered together, the tents were struck and packed; and the terrifying journey over the dreadful <b>Chilkoot</b> <b>Pass</b> was begun.|$|E
6000|$|Aye! It {{belongs to}} the world. The {{ptarmigan}} in <b>Chilkoot</b> <b>Pass</b> discards his winter white feathers for brown; the Patagonian Beau Brummell oils his chignon and clubs him another sweetheart to drag to his skull-strewn flat. And down in Chrystie Street-- ...|$|E
60|$|By {{the middle}} of the {{afternoon}} all hands found themselves encamped along the half-dried-up stream back of the settlement. Here there were nearly a hundred tents of miners and prospectors who were not quite ready to attempt the trip over <b>Chilkoot</b> <b>Pass.</b>|$|E
60|$|Five {{minutes of}} {{struggling}} {{in the current}} found him safe on the opposite shore to that upon which the lower portion of the trail to <b>Chilkoot</b> <b>Pass</b> lay. The question now was, how {{to get back to}} the other side of the river.|$|E
60|$|The Portneys, having {{reached the}} highest point of <b>Chilkoot</b> <b>Pass,</b> were {{presently}} joined by Captain Zoss and Dr. Barwaithe, who had gone through a similar experience to that just described. The doctor had once come very close to losing his footing, and he declared {{that he would not}} make the climb again for a million dollars.|$|E
60|$|Ere they {{crawled into}} the tent, both boys {{took a look}} at the great, white mountains, which loomed up before them. Here was the {{entrance}} to <b>Chilkoot</b> <b>Pass,</b> and there, almost lost among the clouds, was the dreaded summit, with mountains still higher on either side of it. Randy drew closer to Earl as he surveyed the awe-inspiring scene.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{a regular}} {{outfitting}} store not far from here. But {{the first thing to}} be done, now you have turned up, is to secure those passage tickets to Juneau. The Alaskan fever is setting in strong here, and we'll not be alone on our trip over <b>Chilkoot</b> <b>Pass</b> and along the headwaters of the Yukon." ...|$|E
60|$|John Thompson, the new agent, laughed; but Jees Uck {{had faith}} in the mischances of sea and river. Neil Bonner might be frozen in {{anywhere}} between <b>Chilkoot</b> <b>Pass</b> and St. Michael's, for the last travellers of the year are always caught by the ice, when they exchange boat for sled and dash on through the long hours behind the flying dogs.|$|E
6000|$|... "All bound fer the Klondike!" [...] exclaimed the captain. [...] "Hooray! We're sure {{to strike}} it, eh, Portney? I know you wouldn't be a-goin' thar unless gold {{was to be}} picked up. Goin' over <b>Chilkoot</b> <b>Pass,</b> I take it." [...] Foster Portney nodded. [...] "Then {{we might as well}} stick together, eh? It will be better than pairing off with {{somebody}} as might be wuss nor a hoss thief, eh? O' course it would!" ...|$|E
60|$|The rapids and the Tachun River passed, it {{was almost}} a {{straight}} sail northwest to the ruins of old Fort Selkirk. But little could be seen of the former fort, the Indians having overturned the very foundations in their search for trinkets and articles of value. They encamped at the spot over-night and were joined on the following morning by two other parties who had crossed <b>Chilkoot</b> <b>Pass</b> two days after themselves.|$|E
60|$|At Sheep Camp, {{which lay}} in {{something}} of a hollow, {{there had been a}} goodly collection of trees and brush, but now, as the little party started on the journey to the summit of <b>Chilkoot</b> <b>Pass,</b> all this was left behind, and nothing confronted them but immense beds or glaciers of snow, which crunched under their feet and gave forth a hollow sound. At certain points they could plainly hear the rushing of water far beneath.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was chary {{of believing}} {{the men at}} first, for I know only too well how many wild-cat reports start up in every mining camp. But {{a couple of days}} later I heard another report from Juneau, Alaska, to the effect that several miners had come down from this same {{territory}} by way of the lakes and <b>Chilkoot</b> <b>Pass,</b> and had brought with them over thirty-five thousand dollars in nuggets and gold dust, taken out of a place called Hunker's Creek, which runs into the Klondike.|$|E
60|$|Usually {{the journey}} to Lake Linderman was made in two stages, the first from Dyea to the {{entrance}} to <b>Chilkoot</b> <b>Pass,</b> and the second over the Pass itself {{and down to the}} lake, which may fairly be called the southern headwaters of the Yukon River. This course was to be pursued by the present party, and bright and early on the following morning they started out on what was destined to be the most perilous trip of their lives. Captain Zoss went ahead with the Indians, while the boys and their uncle and the doctor kept in a bunch behind.|$|E
60|$|In {{this story}} are related {{the adventures of}} two Maine boys who leave their home among the lumbermen, travel to California, there to join their uncle, an {{experienced}} miner, and several other men, and start on the long trip to the Klondike by way of Dyea, <b>Chilkoot</b> <b>Pass,</b> and the lakes and streams forming {{the headwaters of the}} mighty Yukon River. After many perils the gold district is reached, and here a summer and winter are passed, the former in hunting for the precious metal and the latter in a never ending struggle to sustain life until the advent of spring.|$|E
60|$|Lake Linderman {{is but a}} {{few miles}} long, lying {{in the midst of}} snow-clad mountains, similar to those left behind, {{although}} not quite so high. At its lower end it connects with Lake Bennett by a short river where are situated the Homan Rapids. These rapids are among the most dangerous encountered in sailing along the headwaters of the Yukon, and are feared more by some miners than are the famous White Horse Rapids, which the party must pass through later on. To avoid the Homan Rapids many miners travelled straight from <b>Chilkoot</b> <b>Pass</b> to Lake Bennett before stopping to build their boats.|$|E
