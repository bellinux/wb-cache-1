5000|$|The railroad's traffic {{consists}} {{largely of}} general freight, including lumber products, metals, chemicals and stone products, although COFC (<b>container</b> <b>on</b> <b>flat</b> <b>car)</b> and TOFC (trailer on flat car) business is also operated from the Canada-US border to Boston, {{in partnership with}} the Providence and Worcester Railroad. [...] The NECR hauled around 37,000 carloads in 2008.|$|E
5000|$|COFC (<b>container</b> <b>on</b> <b>flat</b> <b>car)</b> {{cars are}} {{typically}} 89 ft long and carry four 20 ft intermodal containers or two 40 ft/45 ft shipping containers (the two 45 ft containers are carryable {{due to the}} fact that the car is actually 92 ft long, over the strike plates). With the rise of intermodal freight transport-specific cars, and given the age of most of these flats, numbers will decline over the next several years. Indeed, when the first well cars appeared, allowing double stacking, many container flats were re-built as autoracks. The few [...] "new build" [...] container flats are identifiable by their lack of decking, welded steel frame, and standard 89 ft length. One variant is the 50 ft car (which usually carries one large container as a load); these are actually re-built old boxcars. Common reporting marks are FEC, CP, SOO and KTTX. The ATTX cars, which feature non-sparking grips and sides, are built for hauling dangerous goods (ammunition, flammable fluids, etc.).|$|E
5000|$|The peak of {{rail freight}} came during World War II, when New York industries, {{including}} the Brooklyn Navy Yard, worked {{around the clock}} to support the war effort. After the war, the Interstate Highway System was built, along with many inland waterways, both competing with the railroads. The rail industry went through widespread consolidations and bankruptcies. Containerization revolutionized shipping. The Port Authority developed the Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal on Newark Bay. Piers in Brooklyin and Manhattan declined in usage and were abandoned. The 1980 Staggers Rail Act largely deregulated the U.S. railroads. The railroads de-emphasized [...] "retail" [...] railroading—movement of {{one or a few}} rail cars from a shipper's siding to a destination siding—in favor of long unit trains for bulk commodities, such as coal and ore. General cargo shifted to intermodal movement, first trailers <b>on</b> <b>flat</b> <b>cars</b> (TOFC), intermodal <b>containers</b> <b>on</b> <b>flat</b> <b>cars</b> (COFC), and then double-stacked <b>containers,</b> loaded <b>on</b> special well cars. Much manufacturing shifted to Asia, particularly Japan and China, leading to a sharp increase in international container movements.|$|R

50|$|The {{origins of}} the Freightliner concept {{go back to the}} mid-1960s when as part of its {{modernisation}} and rationalisation programme, British Rail began moving freight using shipping <b>containers</b> <b>on</b> <b>flat</b> wagons between a series of dedicated inland terminals, using gantry cranes for transshipment between road and rail.|$|R
25|$|Starting in {{this early}} period, most autoracks were mounted <b>on</b> <b>flat</b> <b>cars</b> leased from a leasing company, such as Trailer Train (see below), North American Car (NIFX marks), Merchants Despatch (MDAX marks), American Refrigerator Transit (MPFX marks), or Pullman's Transport Leasing Division (TLCX marks), but many roads also {{operated}} cars mounted <b>on</b> their own <b>flat</b> <b>cars.</b> Railroads {{known to have}} done so include ATSF, CN, CP, CR, CRR, D, FEC, GN, GTW, KCS, L, Monon, MP, N, RI, SCL, SLSF, SOO, Southern, SP, SSW, UP, WM, and WP.|$|R

50|$|Logs {{from the}} {{township}} of Brown, on the Still River, and Ferrie, on the Magnetawan, were either boomed and towed to Victoria Harbour, from Byng Inlet, or placed <b>on</b> <b>flat</b> <b>cars</b> and {{delivered by the}} CPR to Pakesley. Schroeder had also purchased the #3 mill at Victoria Harbour and lumber was produced and marketed from there.|$|R
5000|$|In 1926 started regular {{connection}} of the luxury passenger train from London to Paris, Golden Arrow/Fleche d'Or with British Southern Railway. For transport of passengers' baggage four containers were used. These containers were loaded in London or Paris and carried to ports, Dover or Calais, <b>on</b> <b>flat</b> <b>cars</b> in the UK and “CIWL Pullman Golden Arrow Fourgon of CIWL” in France.|$|R
50|$|The Lauterbrunnen-Mürren line also handles {{goods traffic}} {{to and from}} Mürren. This is done by {{carrying}} the goods in pallets that are carried under the cable <b>car</b> and <b>on</b> <b>flat</b> <b>cars</b> towed by the railcars. The pallets are transferred between the two by a complicated machine, part fork lift truck and part funicular, within the Grütschalp station complex. The complex also houses the workshops of the line.|$|R
5000|$|Tropicana {{purchased}} {{one million}} dollars worth of refrigerated trucks to deliver Pure Premium. Soon, 2,000 dairies delivered Pure Premium orange juice to the doorsteps of consumers each morning. By 1958, a ship, S.S. Tropicana, was taking [...] of juice to New York each week from the new base at Cape Canaveral, Florida. From 1960 to 1970, Tropicana utilized TOFC (trailers <b>on</b> <b>flatbed</b> <b>cars)</b> to move the juice more efficiently.|$|R

2500|$|Camboose {{as a cook}} shack was in use in English {{at least}} by 1805, when it was used in a New York Chronicle article cited in the New English Dictionary {{describing}} a New England shipwreck, which reported that [...] " [...] William Duncan drifted aboard the canboose [...]" [...] As the first railroad cabooses were wooden shanties erected <b>on</b> <b>flat</b> <b>cars</b> {{as early as the}} 1830s, they would have resembled the cook shack on a ship's deck.|$|R
50|$|A TOFC (trailer <b>on</b> <b>flat</b> <b>car,</b> a.k.a. piggy-back) car once again, {{is usually}} an 89 ft car. In the past, these carried three 30 ft {{trailers}} which are, as of 2007, almost obsolete, or one large, 53 ft, two 40 ft or 45 ft trailers. As intermodal traffic grows, these dedicated flats are in decline. Most have been modified to also carry containers. One notable type is Canadian Pacific Railway's XTRX service—dedicated five-unit flats that only carry trailers.|$|R

50|$|The idea of {{transporting}} trucks {{on ships}} {{was put into}} practice before World War II. In 1926 regular connection of the luxury passenger train from London to Paris, Golden Arrow/Fleche d'Or, by Southern Railway and French Northern Railway began. For transport of passengers' baggage four containers were used. These containers were loaded in London or Paris and carried to ports, Dover or Calais, <b>on</b> <b>flat</b> <b>cars</b> in the UK and “CIWL Pullman Golden Arrow Fourgon of CIWL” in France.|$|R

25|$|Although railroads {{were just}} {{beginning}} to see the advantages that autoracks delivered in the 1960s, most North American railroads were reluctant to invest in such specially built equipment. The Trailer Train Company, organized by the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Norfolk and Western Railway in 1955, stepped in to ease the railroads' financial burden a bit. Trailer Train purchased the <b>flat</b> <b>cars</b> from the rail car manufacturers, and the railroads that wanted to operate autoracks, purchased the racks that were installed <b>on</b> those <b>flat</b> <b>cars.</b> Such cars were easily spotted at trackside due to the reporting marks identifying Trailer Train <b>on</b> the <b>flat</b> <b>car</b> portion of the car and the railroad's logo (usually much larger) in the upper portion of the rack.|$|R

5000|$|Lewis J. Ingalls (June 18, 1837-December 31, 1913) was a {{recipient}} of the Medal of Honor. He was awarded the Medal of Honor when [...] "A railroad train guarded by about 60 men <b>on</b> <b>flat</b> <b>cars</b> having been sidetracked by a misplaced switch into an ambuscade of guerrillas who were rapidly shooting down the unprotected guards, this soldier, under a severe fire {{in which he was}} wounded, ran to another switch and, opening it, enabled the train and the surviving guards to escape." ...|$|R
5000|$|Traffic on the River Subdivision {{consists}} {{mostly of}} long distance trains composed of intermodal, TOFC (Trailer <b>On</b> <b>Flat</b> <b>Car),</b> unit, and mixed commodity trains.Traffic density varies, but on weekdays, {{you can expect}} to see 15 to 20 trains during daylight hours. Saturdays can provide 18-24 trains during the day, Sundays may only have 8-14 trains. Again, this can vary greatly, depending on available crews, track work, etc. You can expect to see 2-5 oil trains and 1-2 ethanol trains per day.(2015) ...|$|R
60|$|The {{matter was}} talked over, {{and in the}} end it was agreed that Dick and Sam should ride <b>on</b> the <b>flat</b> <b>car,</b> while Tom went with Stanley and Jack Mason in the automobile. Then the section boss went off to get the freight engine to haul the <b>flat</b> <b>car.</b>|$|R

50|$|One {{reason for}} the fire's long {{duration}} involved the lack of national standards in firefighting equipment. Despite fire engines from nearby cities (such as Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. as well as units from New York City, Virginia, Wilmington, and Atlantic City) responding with horse-drawn pumpers, wagons and other related equipment (primitive by modern-day standards, but only steam engines were motorized in that era) carried by the railroads <b>on</b> <b>flat</b> <b>cars</b> and box cars, many were unable to help since their hose couplings could not fit Baltimore's fire hydrants.|$|R
5000|$|In 1952, the CPR {{became the}} first North American railway to {{introduce}} intermodal or [...] "piggyback" [...] freight service, where truck trailersare carried <b>on</b> <b>flat</b> <b>cars.</b> <b>Containers</b> later replaced most piggyback service. In 1996, the CPR introduced a scheduled reservation-only short-haul intermodal service between Montreal and West Toronto called the Iron Highway; it utilized unique equipment that was later replaced (1999) by conventional piggyback flatcars and renamed Expressway. This service was extended to Detroit with plans to reach Chicago however CP was unable to locate a suitable terminal.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; I told Wampus it was impracticable," [...] was the reply. [...] "We shall load our machine <b>on</b> a <b>flat</b> <b>car</b> {{and ship}} it to Albuquerque, {{which is in}} New Mexico and almost {{directly}} south of Denver. We shall then be over the worst grades of the Rocky Mountains." ...|$|R
60|$|The others {{went off}} in the touring auto, and Dick and Sam made {{themselves}} at home <b>on</b> the <b>flat</b> <b>car.</b> Soon a freight engine backed up, the car was attached; and off they started, in company with the section boss and two track laborers, {{in the direction of}} Ashton.|$|R
5000|$|The first ships {{designed}} to carrying standardized load units were {{use in the}} late 18th century in England. In 1766 James Brindley designed the box boat [...] "Starvationer" [...] with 10 wooden containers, to transport coal from Worsley Delph to Manchester by Bridgewater Canal. Before the Second World War first container ships were used to carrying baggages of the luxury passenger train from London to Paris, Golden Arrow/Fleche d'Or, in 1926 by Southern Railway. These containers were loaded in London or Paris and carried to ports, Dover or Calais, <b>on</b> <b>flat</b> <b>cars</b> in the UK and [...] "CIWL Pullman Golden Arrow Fourgon of CIWL" [...] in France.|$|R
5000|$|The German Wehrmacht would {{sometimes}} put a Fremdgerät, {{such as a}} captured French Somua S-35 or Czech PzKpfw 38(t) light tank, or Panzer II light tank <b>on</b> a <b>flatbed</b> <b>car</b> which could be quickly offloaded {{by means of a}} ramp and used away from the range of the main railway line to chase down enemy partisans ...|$|R
50|$|A {{crossing}} was prefabricated in Sebastopol {{and loaded}} <b>on</b> a <b>flat</b> <b>car</b> {{pushed to the}} crossing location, but when the interurban crew arrived to install the crossing on 3 January 1905, they found a pair of steam locomotives {{on either side of}} the crossing fitted with steam nozzles to spray hot water on anyone approaching the crossing site. The interurban construction crew retreated.|$|R
5000|$|By comparison, the Rollbock {{system of}} {{transporter}} train {{required that the}} wagons be loaded one at a time. It is not known what speed the piggyback train could achieve, but {{it is noted that}} the standard gauge line was brand new with gentle curves and gradients. The term [...] "piggy-back" [...] referred to road freight vehicles loaded <b>on</b> rail <b>flat</b> <b>cars.</b>|$|R
2500|$|By this time, in the United States, most circuses still {{traveled}} by rail. Circuses were major haulers of wheeled vehicles, carrying {{all of their}} vehicles <b>on</b> <b>flat</b> <b>cars,</b> usually behind their own passenger cars or in separate sections of their trains; basically, one train would haul the performers and employees while a second train would haul the vehicles and freight. The circus solution to loading vehicles was to use a string of flatcars. A temporary ramp was placed {{at the end of}} the flatcars and temporary bridge plates spanned the gaps between adjacent flatcars; the road vehicles were driven or towed up onto one car and then driven or towed down the train. This type of vehicle loading became known as [...] "circus style" [...] due to its frequent use by circuses.|$|R
50|$|By the 1980s {{the system}} would own 11,469 miles of rail line over 11 states bounded by Chicago to the east, Pueblo, Colorado, in the west, north to Omaha, south to the U.S.-Mexico border in Laredo, Texas, and {{southeast}} along the Gulf seaports of Louisiana and Texas. MoPac operated a fleet of more than 1,500 diesel locomotives, almost all purchased within the previous 10 years. Under the leadership of Downing B. Jenks, who became {{president and chief executive}} in 1961 the company became a pioneer {{in the early days of}} computer-guided rail technology. It was a major hauler of grain, TOFC (Trailer <b>on</b> <b>Flat</b> <b>Car),</b> coal, ore, autos and dry goods. At the time of their mega-merger in 1982 the MoPac owned newer locomotives, more locomotives and operated more track than partner Union Pacific Railroad.|$|R
