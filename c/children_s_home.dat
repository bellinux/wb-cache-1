40|$|Introduction: The {{right to}} {{adequate}} food is protected in {{international human rights}} law, yet {{millions of people are}} suffering from malnutrition worldwide. Children and adolescents living in children s homes are considered a vulnerable group. Malnutrition in the girl child is of particular concern since it has intergenerational consequences. Little is known about the nutritional status of adolescent girls living in children s homes in Kampala City, Uganda. A cross-sectional study is an important first step to identify the main nutritional challenges in order to intervene appropriately. Aim: The main aim {{of the study was to}} assess the nutritional status of adolescent girls in children s homes in Kampala City, by evaluating anthropometric indicators, assessing body composition and investigating dietary patterns. Subjects and methods: A total of 44 girls aged 10 – 19 years living at five children s homes participated in the study. A reference group consisted of 27 adolescent girls from three boarding schools in Kampala City. Height and weight were measured to assess the proportion of girls who were stunted, thin, overweight or obese. Body composition data was obtained by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Dietary intake was evaluated with a Food Frequency Questionnaire, calculation of dietary diversity score (DDS) and a 24 -hour dietary recall. Results: Adolescent girls in selected children s homes in Kampala City suffered from stunting, overweight or obesity, and were at risk of insufficient intakes of multiple micronutrients and essential fatty acids. Dietary diversity was low with a median score of 3 out of 9 food groups. Animal products were rarely consumed. <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> <b>home</b> participants appeared especially at risk of inadequate intake of vitamins A, B 12, C, D, E and calcium. Median estimated intake of vitamins B 12 and D were zero. The adequacy of the diet in terms of energy, macronutrients and micronutrients varied among the different children s homes, and within the various homes. At two of the children s homes the girls consumed a more adequate diet compared to the reference group, whereas three homes consumed a less adequate diet compared to the reference group. Conclusion: Malnutrition was apparent among <b>children</b> <b>s</b> <b>home</b> participants, manifested as stunting, overweight or obesity. The girls are likely to suffer from inadequate intake of essential fatty acids and multiple micronutrient deficiencies, especially vitamin B 12...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{aimed to}} establish the effect of dance movement therapy on self-esteem and level of hostility in an adolescent population at a <b>children</b> <b>s</b> <b>home.</b> A quantitative study, using quasi-experimental design, {{was carried out in}} the form of standardised questionnaires. The qualitative data was used to investigate the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and Cook-Medley Hostility Scale. A total of 18 participants participated in the research of which eight were assigned to the experimental group and ten to the control group. A between-group comparison was done for both questionnaires on the results of the pre- and post-test of both groups. All 18 participants completed the two questionnaires (pre-test) and thereafter the experimental group were subjected to the six-week dance movement therapy programme. Again, the 18 participants completed both the questionnaires (post-test). Non-parametric statistics was used to determine whether a difference existed between the experimental- and control group. It appears that the experimental group did not show statistical significant difference between the pre- and post-test in both variables. However, possible explanations for the lack of statistical significant results are discussed. Further research, especially conducted on a South African population, is necessary {{to establish the}} role of dance movement therapy on sexual abuse victims.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} {{and impact of}} childhood trauma is so extensive that {{it has come to}} be known as a silent epidemic. Trauma affects children s social, biological, psychological, and emotional functioning, which impede their ability for healthy self-regulation. Conventional therapies seem to have limited success in addressing the long-term consequences of trauma, arguably due to a lack of understanding the neurobiological impact of trauma and its effect on therapy with traumatised children. Researchers therefore recommend that therapists in the field of child welfare review the way they work with traumatised children, taking into consideration the neurobiological principles informing trauma interventions. The goal of this research study was to explore the effect of Gestalt play therapy in addressing symptoms associated with trauma in children in middle childhood. As this study aimed to explore more efficient ways of working with traumatised children, applied research was conducted. A mixed methods research approach was utilised in order to combine the advantages of qualitative inquiry and quantitative evaluation. The researcher incorporated a triangulation mixed methods design, combining the single-system design and the phenomenological design at the same time and with equal weight. Data was collected at three consecutive points in the research process to determine the prevalence of trauma-related symptoms and how it changed over time. All three data-collection encounters entailed structured and semi-structured interviews, for which a questionnaire and interview schedule was used respectively. By means of purposive sampling, the researcher with the assistance of social workers from the <b>children</b> <b>s</b> <b>home,</b> selected five participants between nine and 11 years, who presented with trauma-related symptoms, who have been residents of a <b>children</b> <b>s</b> <b>home</b> for more than six months, and who were not involved in any other form of therapy at the time of the research. The findings of the study were in accordance with literature on the impact of trauma, especially on children in middle childhood, and furthermore correlated with a Gestalt perspective of how trauma affects children. Trauma-related symptoms the participants experienced reflected affect- and behaviour dysregulation, alterations in attention and consciousness, distortions in attribution and worldview, and interpersonal difficulties. Though the participants responses to trauma, as well as to Gestalt play therapy, varied; improvement was noted in the overall prevalence of symptoms associated with trauma after implementation of the Gestalt play therapy process. In this regard, the research findings indicated a statistically significant improvement in the total prevalence of trauma-related symptoms the participants experienced before being exposed to Gestalt play therapy, as was confirmed by the qualitative findings. It was concluded that Gestalt play therapy incorporates suggestions for trauma-informed interventions with traumatised children, and with its strong sensory base and utilisation of non-verbal and creative techniques, was an appropriate therapeutic intervention for addressing trauma-related symptoms in children in middle childhood. Based on these conclusions, it is recommended that professionals who work with traumatised children consider trauma-informed practices in the restoration of self-regulation through non-verbal and creative measures in the context of a safe and accepting relationship. As this research involved a small and limited study sample, further research that could add to the transferability of the findings is advised.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The HIV {{epidemic}} in South Africa has increased {{not only the}} number of ill children but also the number of orphans. Although the establishment of orphanages is not sustainable, the number of residential care facilities continues to increase. Many persons working in South African <b>children</b> <b>s</b> <b>homes</b> can testify to the impact HIV has had on this sector, but no studies have actually measured it. AIMS The primary aim {{of this research was}} to determine the impact of HIV on the Johannesburg <b>children</b> <b>s</b> <b>homes.</b> The secondary aims were to make recommendations informed by this research to assist <b>children</b> <b>s</b> <b>homes</b> to mitigate the impact and to inform the activities of the <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> <b>Homes</b> Outreach Medical Programme (CHOMP). METHODS A rapid appraisal of all <b>children</b> <b>s</b> <b>homes</b> in the greater Johannesburg was done by means of a telephonic survey. This was followed by an in depth analysis of 24 <b>children</b> <b>s</b> <b>homes</b> through the use of questionnaires, data collection forms, a pop quiz for residential child care workers and the inspection of facilities.

40|$|Working in Children's Homes {{is one of}} an {{important}} series of books on residential care based on research sponsored by the Department of Health. This book draws on extensive research conducted over a three-year period. The authors address the challenges and complexities facing {{those who work with}} and in <b>children</b> <b>s</b> <b>homes.</b> On the basis of interviews and discussions with heads of homes and staff groups, the authors explore the tasks which face staff groups, the rationale for their procedures, their sources of stresses and rewards, and the everyday ups and downs characteristic of residential care. Key tasks are discussed in depth, such as working with individual children, the mix of young people, managers and others in their own organisation, and the wider networks surrounding the home and the child. Characteristics of good practice are named, and factors which facilitate good practice and good outcomes are identified. Valuable recommendations are made for: * implementing and modifying procedures to improve working practices * staff selection and training * support required by staff groups * procedures and communication channels in the larger organisation and surrounding networks Working in <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> <b>Homes</b> provides a comprehensive commentary on the nature of care and working practices related to <b>children</b> <b>s</b> <b>homes.</b> It is essential reading for all those concerned with the care of children and young people in residential settings...|$|R
40|$|Background: Many {{studies showed}} links between Indoor Air Pollutants of {{dwellings}} and asthmatic children. Self screening questionnaires for {{indoor air pollution}} (IAP) exist but none has been validated. We have built a self-administered questionnaire for screening IAP in asthmatic children {{using data from the}} literature and existing questionnaires unvalidated self. Aim: The goal is to validate the self-administered questionnaire items, this is the main objective. The second is to show an association between sources of pollution or contaminants from the air of the home and the degree of asthma. Method: First of all, we asked general practitioners in Vienne and in Charente Maritime for the recruitment of asthmatic children seen in primary care. Self IAP questionnaire was filled by the <b>child</b> <b>s</b> parents. Then second of all, a survey of asthmatic <b>children</b> <b>s</b> <b>homes</b> was completed. Observations and samples of indoor air pollutants (VOCs, mold, dust mites, particles, temperature, humidity) were performed to verify the consistency of responses to the self-administered questionnaire. Results: On the one hand, 9 items self questionnaire IAP within the house in a population of 50 asthmatic children seen in primary care have been statistically validated. On the other hand, the lack of means of aeration in the kitchen is associated only with children whose severity stage is level 2 and 3. A link between chlorine and within groups 2 and 3 levels was found. Several VOCs in the indoor air of within the house including chlorine, propanal, chloroform, were measured at high rates at least 50 % of dwellings, see about 90 % for chlorine. Conclusion: This study has validated the items of the self-administered questionnaire. It remains to be confirmed with a larger sample observations in our study namely the association found between levels of asthma more severe and the presence of chlorine in indoor air at hight rates and the absence of aeration in the kitchen. The pursuit of scientific research chemical pollutants indoor air seems necessary. POITIERS-BU Médecine pharmacie (861942103) / SudocSudocFranceF...|$|R
40|$|Background: More than 14 {{percent of}} {{children}} in Uganda are orphaned, {{and many of them}} live in children s homes. Very little information exists regarding how these homes are operated and what the conditions in these homes are like. A baseline study conducted in forty children s homes revealed however that diet was very limited, and residents were looking malnourished. Ugandan authorities have targeted adolescent girls as a priority group for nutrition interventions as safeguarding nutritional health before pregnancy can reduce the chance of passing on malnutrition to the offspring, and thus, future generations. By being State Party to relevant international and regional human rights instruments, Ugandan authorities have obligations under international human rights law to progressively realise the rights to adequate food, health and care (the underlying conditions for achieving good nutrition) for all Ugandan children, female adolescent children s homes residents included. Objectives: Two objectives guided this study: 1) To examine female adolescent residents experiences, attitudes and views regarding: i) eating patterns and food, ii) health conditions; iii) care practices in the <b>children</b> <b>s</b> <b>home</b> they are living in. 2) On the basis of the findings under 1), to consider if the conditions in children s homes comply with human rights standards and principles for the rights to adequate food, health and care. Methodology: A human rights-based approach has guided the planning and conduct of this study, which also resulted in using focus group discussions as the method for data collection. Five children s homes in Kampala were selected for inclusion. At each home, two focus group discussions were held with girls aged 12 - 14 years, and girls aged 15 - 17, respectively. Issues discussed during the focused discussions included the ones under Objective 1. The focus group discussions were analysed through a phenomenological approach. The conditions of food, health and care, as experienced by female adolescent residents, were further compared with international standards for the realisation of the human rights to adequate food, health and care. Results: Results of Objective 1 demonstrated that food, health and care conditions varied greatly across the five children s homes in Kampala. Some residents consume only one meal per day, and have no access to clean drinking water, soap, toilet paper and sanitary napkins. Residents at one home explained how caretakers act discriminatory and mentally abuse them. This was in large contrast with conditions in two other homes where residents described great satisfaction with food and meal frequency, had a constant availability of basic necessities including clean drinking water, and where care is promoted through participatory activities where both residents and caretakers are equalised. Results of Objective 2 demonstrated that the full realisation of the right to adequate food is not met by the residents at three homes, the full realisation of the right to health is not met by the residents at two homes, and the realisation of the right to care is not met by the residents at one home. Conclusion: Human rights standards for food, health and care were not met in three of the selected children s homes. The results from this study indicated that care in the children s homes was an important contributing factor for whether or not standards for the rights to adequate food and health were met. Ugandan authorities should put in all efforts possible to improve the conditions. As an immediate response, they can revise and enhance regulations for operation of children s homes in Uganda to include more specific provisions relevant for food, health and care...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Ethiopia is {{a country}} {{represented}} by the three wide horizontal strips of green, yellow and red coloured national flag constituting about 70 million people. It is an old nation with people proud of their culture and civilization. Like several other countries, Ethiopia is a land of a multitude of nations, nationalities and people with diverse languages, religion and culture. Like other developing countries, in Ethiopia, the low socio-economic condition, the traditional beliefs of child rearing practice, the family size and the low educational background of the family put adverse pressure on the socio-emotional and learning development of Ethiopian children. Many children are underachievers {{due to the lack}} of proper guidance and support from their adult caregivers. For most Ethiopian children elementary school teachers play the role of caregivers next to the family {{due to the lack of}} early intervention services. Economically affected nations such as Ethiopia expect much from elementary school teachers since they are better trained and responsible to give systematic support to fill the missing gap from the <b>children</b> <b>s</b> <b>home</b> environment in the endeavour to influence the socio-emotional and learning development of the children in their early years. Thus, elementary school teachers are expected to be responsive to the needs of their students. Teachers affection, warmth, encouragement etc are the bases for the socio-emotional and learning development of the students in their early years of age. Classroom care and support have been the focus of this baseline study. To be able to create safe classrooms in which students feel safe and supported this qualitative study examined the care giving behaviour and self perception of three teachers in their classrooms. The teachers general views and attitudes towards their students were found to be positive. Love and care are viewed as parts of the duties and responsibilities of the teachers. The existing national educational policies have become solid grounds in the process of knowing the needs and interests of the students and meeting them. However, it was found out that the methods of assessment used by the teachers were not satisfactory. The enormity of the class size, parental low socio-economical backgrounds and the wide age gap among students in class have been the major challenges of the teachers to provide quality care and support to their students. The study made use of the eight guiding themes of the ICDP adapted for school-age children to evaluate the quality care giving behaviour of the teachers in the classroom teacher-student interactions. Teachers showed a good deal of interest to talk to their students individually and as a group. Teachers have also been seen praising and acknowledging their students. In general all the eight guiding themes have been manifested within a wide range of frequency counts. The method of teaching that teachers often used, the concern of the teachers to consider the interests of their students when they organized their classrooms and the overall communication among the school staff members have been motivating and encouraging to the teachers. The physical condition of the classrooms and the access and quality of the teaching materials need to be improved to motivate the students learning. Based on the findings through multiple data sources the study forwarded possible recommendations within which on-job training for teachers about the nature and development of the needs and level of mastery of students, feasible and effective methods of assessment were emphasized. The study also indicated the need for school support units and school-based intervention programs where multi-professional assessment and support for students are given to assist teachers...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} feeling of insecurity that parents have regarding their <b>children</b> <b>s</b> journeys to school. Parents, professors, and many other professionals were included in a survey to rate the different features that children might encounter when walking along and crossing the streets on their routes to school. By giving the street network an impedance attribute known as insecurity {{with regards to the}} issue of motorized traffic and street infrastructure, the idea is to assess the accessibility from <b>children</b> <b>s</b> <b>homes</b> to school from this different viewpoint. Using feeling of insecurity during accessibility analysis, planners and engineers can assess the school environment when identifying dangerous locations or areas that require improvement. The methodology used to rate streets is the utilization of a stated-preference survey followed by a Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA) and Analysis Hierarchy Process (AHP). Moreover, this research presents one particular method for developing an accurate street network, representing where pedestrians can walk and cross the street, from a dataset containing the center line of a street network (typically designed for motorized vehicles). Once the street network is created, the attributes required for such a network to perform the analysis are presented and also the source of the data used when populating each attribute. The original idea of a traffic safety impedance comes from the Federal Highway Administration of Washington DC (FHWA), which developed a methodology to rate streets and crossings according to different parameters. This methodology is modified in this research and is combined with a Multicriteria Analysis (MCA) and Analysis Hierarchy Process (AHP) to perform an analysis based on a subjective perception of insecurity experienced on streets. The model will look for streets with width sidewalks, also separation of motorized traffic and vulnerable road users, and finally low speed limit and traffic flow. On the contrary, this model will avoid busy intersections or streets with higher speed limit and heavy traffic volume. Finally, a case study is performed which applies all the methodology presented here in order to demonstrate a real life case where such methodology might be of use. The case study uses one primary school in the city of Trondheim (Norway), creating a pedestrian network within the school boundary, and performing an analysis that attempts to identify problematic locations where traffic safety measures may be necessary. This research aims to present a useful tool for assessing <b>children</b> <b>s</b> traffic safety and could be used along with traffic safety audits...|$|R

40|$|Background and aim: Every {{third child}} {{assigned}} to the Primary Child Health Care services in Stockholm County is of foreign origin. The aim of this thesis was to explore aspects that might risk an optimal and high quality interaction between the nurses and parents of foreign origin and {{their children in the}} clinical child health services. An additional aim was to use this knowledge to create a specific training in cultural competence directed to nurses and evaluate the effectiveness of this. Material and methods: Both quantitative (Study I and IV) and qualitative (Study II and III) research methods were selected. Study I: quantitative data collection among nurses (n= 270) through a questionnaire and data analysis using logistic regression. Study II: qualitative data collection among nurses (n= 19) through interviews utilising Grounded Theory Methodology (GTM). Study III: qualitative data collection among parents (n= 21) through interviews utilising GTM. Study IV: quantitative data collection through questionnaires in pre- and poststudy design among the intervention group (n= 24) and a control group (n= 27) of nurses. Data analysed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and variance analysis. Results: The nurses reported insufficient working conditions and cultural competence. They experienced difficulties in their interaction with this group of children and their parents, and the difficulties were particularly associated with long professional experience, full-time work and a high proportion of children of foreign origin. The nurses main concern turned out to be their anxiety about missing children being exposed to risks of ill-health due to various conditions in their home environments. Unfamiliar and not understandable psychosocial conditions created difficulties for the nurses when trying to assess health risks for the <b>child</b> <b>s</b> health and development. A theoretical model was created that explains the process of assessing risks for the <b>child</b> <b>s</b> health and various elucidating strategies used by the nurses. The parents main concern turned out to be their feelings of exposure and anxiety about being misjudged as parents due to their origin. Hence they were watchfully checking rapport i. e. if they could perceive sympathy and understanding from the nurses. A theoretical model was created that illustrates the interactive process between parents and nurses and factors determining whether parents believed that rapport was possible to be established. After specific training, the intervention group of nurses rated their cultural competence to be somewhat improved, especially their cultural skills. Conclusions: Deficient working conditions, lack of cultural competence and experiences of difficulties were found among nurses. Assessing risk factors in a <b>child</b> <b>s</b> <b>home</b> environment seems to be a difficult task for nurses in need of certain competence, skills and elucidating strategies. These strategies could further be developed and frame the nurses cultural skills when performing their assessment of health risks for the child. The possibility to establish rapport with the nurse can prevent parents from feeling hesistant and unwilling to bring the child in for check-ups. Thus, it is crucial for nurses to become aware of their own demeanour and way of interacting with parents and children of foreign origin. The concept of establishing rapport frames and elaborates the concerns of cultural encounters and cultural competence in the context of child health services. Short, specific training programmes in cultural competence are helpful for nurses, who rate them as having an impact on their ability to cope with the demands of working with parents and children of foreign origin. Findings and theoretical models in this thesis are important tools for professional reflection, as a means for teaching cultural competence and as a basis for further exploration and conceptualisation...|$|R

40|$|Aceh {{is one of}} {{the provinces}} in Indonesia which has had an {{important}} historical background. The conflict between the Aceh separatist movement (GAM) and the Indonesian government happened around 30 years ago and caused most Acehnese people to live with torture, suffering, and loss of their family members. Nowadays, children who lived through that situation are parents. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate parental involvement related to students Indonesian language ability in the first and fourth grades at elementary level. The study took place in Sukma Bangsa Pidie Primary School by interviewing the parents of 10 students. The data was collected in August and September 2016 in Sukma Bangsa School and the participants houses. The participants were mothers, fathers, and an elder sister of the students, depending on who were more involved during learning at home. The results showed that parents involvement influences students Indonesian language ability and parents involvement, influenced by the community perspective, family decisions and parenting style, the parents historical background during the Aceh conflict, and the students characters. However, the parents educational background was not related to how parents were involved in their <b>children</b> <b>s</b> learning at <b>home.</b> Furthermore, religion was the dominant aspect influencing parenting style. All the participants put religious education above formal education. The parents who had an authoritative parenting style used Acehnese and Indonesian languages to help their children to construct knowledge and treated them based on the <b>child</b> <b>s</b> needs, had a fixed schedule and had been assisting their child during learning at home. However, the permissive parents lead their children without any demand and gave them freedom. They did not have fixed schedules for learning at home; they only monitored the child without assisting, and did less in practicing Indonesian language and using both of the languages during learning at home.

Methods: the review of the literature was done using Medline, Psyclit, and Lilacs as resources for assessing international and national research articles on child nutrition, with an emphasis on <b>children</b> <b>s</b> eating behavior. These articles were revised and grouped together according to the topic. Results: family is responsible for the development of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> eating behavior through social learning. Parents are <b>children</b> <b>s</b> first nutritional educators. <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> eating experiences are influenced by cultural and psychosocial factors. Social context plays a relevant role in this process, especially through the strategies used by parents to encourage children to have a balanced diet and to eat specific foods. These strategies may contain adequate and inadequate stimuli as to the development of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> food preference and food intake self-control. Conclusion: the learning process is a determining factor for <b>children</b> <b>s</b> eating behavior, and is associated with three factors: food flavor conditioning, food postingestional consequences, and social context.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> library services offer children a means of developing their reading skills through the provision of books and other resources. <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> library services might be operated by public libraries, school library services or schools. A small proportion of public library authorities in the UK choose to operate specialist mobile libraries which cater for children alone. Such vehicles deliver a library service to children {{across a range of}} geographic and socioeconomic areas with the stated aims of promoting reading and a love of books, and accessing children who would not otherwise use library services. This study evaluated whether <b>children</b> <b>s</b> mobile libraries (CMLs) across the UK reach those aims and examined the methods by which the aims were targeted. It was decided that the most appropriate research method was to take an inductive perspective and qualitative approach forming a constructivist methodology. The evaluation was achieved by the use of grounded theory as a general method together with ethnographic techniques, in order to observe and understand the interactions of social actors, and identify the processes used to encourage reading. Interviews with key individuals were primarily held to gain access into the field and inform the scope of the research. Participant observations were conducted on 12 of the 26 <b>children</b> <b>s</b> libraries operating in the UK and further interviews with <b>children</b> <b>s</b> mobile library (CML) operators and CML service managers were also carried out. Extensive field notes were taken, then coded and analysed by the grounded theory method in order to understand <b>children</b> <b>s</b> and adults perceptions of the value of a CML to their lives. A model of the influences on <b>children</b> <b>s</b> reading was developed to understand the place of a CML in <b>children</b> <b>s</b> literacy. Existing published research was used initially to set the context of the study, and then as data throughout the project. Published and recognised theories about literacy development, learning, and well-being were consulted at relevant points during the research. Analytical reports of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> library services, practitioner handbooks and professional magazines were searched along with unpublished documents provided by library authorities. Issues that were raised from these sources included: the role of untrained library staff; supplying library services to the socially excluded; working with other agencies and the use of reading intervention schemes. The history, function, purpose and definition of CMLs were outlined. Five theories of event, reach, resource, process and well-being emerged from the data and examples of best practice were identified. The daily operation of a CML was modelled using those five theories to create a transferable standard against which to judge similar <b>children</b> <b>s</b> provision. It was found that <b>children</b> <b>s</b> mobile libraries promote reading because of their transient nature; through the relationships of children with the staff who work on the vehicles; {{by the nature of the}} learning environment and specialist stock of the <b>children</b> <b>s</b> mobile library, and because they access children who would otherwise not use any other library service...|$|R

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this thesis is to extend the knowledge and deepen the understanding of care-givers management of child allergy, especially of suspected food allergy. This is done by describing and exploring how parents with children who have exclusion diets at school discover and responds to their <b>children</b> <b>s</b> allergy-related problems. The first study focuses on the whole group of children (n 230) with special diets at school {{from the viewpoint of}} parents knowledge and management of the <b>children</b> <b>s</b> problems. It addresses questions regarding (1) whether or not the children have had contact with health care, (2) {{whether or not they were}} diagnosed with food allergy, (3) to what extent they had other allergies, (4) what characterized their food-related symptoms, (5) if these symptoms were consistent with the clinical experience of food allergy (6) and any differences in parents reports of the extent of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> food-related problems in regard to whether they had sought health care or not. The results showed that the majority of parents had consulted doctors for their <b>children</b> <b>s</b> problems, and most children had been diagnosed by a doctor. Most children also had other allergies or asthma in addition to their food-related problems. The <b>children</b> <b>s</b> food-related problems were consistent with the clinical experience of food allergy. Parents who had sought medical aid for their <b>children</b> <b>s</b> problems described more extensive and potentially life-threatening (e. g. anaphylactic) symptoms than did the parents who had not sought professional help. Overall, the characteristics of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> symptoms were similar in both groups and were considerable enough to explain why they avoided certain foods and had exclusion diets at school. The second study addresses the question of how parents discovered developing bodily symptoms when the children were young, how they interpreted and responded to the problems before they decided to seek professional medical help and how they came to the decision to seek help. Nineteen parents were interviewed about the problem-solving process consisting of two temporal phases: (1) the pre-problem phase, or the period before the <b>child</b> <b>s</b> problems had emerged, (2) and the emerging phase where bodily problems were discovered and managed differently depending on the emerging nature of the problem that were either (2. a) acute (airway problems) or (2. b) more gradually appearing (stomach problems and eczema) in the families everyday lives. To understand and manage the time period before the child was born, before he/she had developed any symptoms and the phase when the symptoms emerged, parents used different self-diagnostic techniques and methods. They experimented with different temporal and situational clues that eventually led them to explain their <b>children</b> <b>s</b> symptoms as indicating something wrong, and not as normal <b>children</b> <b>s</b> problems, as they had first thought. Only when parents could not fully explain the <b>child</b> <b>s</b> symptoms or make the problems disappear or improve, did they often seek medical advice or care at the child health care centre. The wide-ranging knowledge and experience parents have of their <b>children</b> <b>s</b> allergies are a result of their active strategies and by reinforcing themselves as active and in control they also demonstrated their moral responsibility as parents. The fact that the <b>child</b> <b>s</b> whole lifetime and different temporal contexts are used by the parents in their decisions about seeking professional help, eating habits and exclusion diet at school is an important factor that has to be considered in clinical practice. Health care professionals have to listen to what parents have done before seeking medical help, who they are and how they want to be seen by others because this would improve the communication between parents and health professionals as well as the parents satisfaction with health care...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This PhD thesis explored the experiences of dependent children and children care-givers facing challenges with their parent s cancer. The aim was to understand <b>children</b> <b>s</b> information experience including their perception of cancer and information culture; information needs, information seeking behaviour, barriers and enablers. The research used a six-stage process. This was informed by an extensive literature review and discussions with cancer specialists, psychologists and researchers from United Kingdom, United States, Australia and Malaysia. This study used a three-cycle, eight-step process of Participative Action Research (PAR) with participation from ten Malay breast cancer patients and their dependent children. Three bilingual (English and Bahasa Malaysia) instruments were developed; 1) An Inquiry to Participate Form to select participants who had dependent children, 2) Three opened-ended questions to obtain <b>children</b> <b>s</b> cancer experience and information needs where drawing was used to encourage <b>children</b> <b>s</b> responses and, 3) A 15 -question questionnaire to understand <b>children</b> <b>s</b> experience and information preference. Cancer affected parenting abilities and challenging experiences identified the lack of culturally relevant information and the shift in caregiving responsibilities to dependent <b>children.</b> <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> understanding of cancer was influenced by their experiences and observations, many of which resulted in misconceptions about cancer, its causes, treatment and preventative measures. <b>Children</b> participant <b>s</b> reaction to a health situation triggered their information behaviour.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} set of {{longitudinal}} studies was to explore 3 - 7 -year-old <b>children.</b> <b>s</b> Spontaneous FOcusing on Numerosity (SFON) {{and its relation to}} early mathematical development. The specific goals were to capture in method and theory the distinct process by which children focus on numerosity as a part of their activities involving exact number recognition, and individual differences in this process that may be informative in the development of more complex number skills. Over the course of conducting the five studies, fifteen novel tasks were progressively developed for the SFON assessments. In the tasks, confounding effects of insufficient number recognition, verbal comprehension, other procedural skills as well as working memory capacity were aimed to be controlled. Furthermore, how <b>children.</b> <b>s</b> individual differences in SFON are related to their development of number sequence, subitizing-based enumeration, object counting and basic arithmetic skills was explored. The effect of social interaction on SFON was tested. Study I captured {{the first phase of the}} 3 -year longitudinal study with 39 children. It was investigated whether there were differences in 3 -year-old <b>children.</b> <b>s</b> tendency to focus on numerosity, and whether these differences were related to the <b>children.</b> <b>s</b> development of cardinality recognition skills from the age of 3 to 4 years. It was found that the two groups of children formed on the basis of their amount of SFON tendency at the age of 3 years differed in their development of recognising and producing small numbers. The children whose SFON tendency was very predominant developed faster in cardinality related skills from the age of 3 to 4 years than the children whose SFON tendency was not as predominant. Thus, <b>children.</b> <b>s</b> development in cardinality recognition skills is related to their SFON tendency. Studies II and III were conducted to investigate, firstly, <b>children.</b> <b>s</b> individual differences in SFON, and, secondly, whether <b>children.</b> <b>s</b> SFON is related to their counting development. Altogether nine tasks were designed for the assessments of spontaneous and guided focusing on numerosity. The longitudinal data of 39 children in Study II from the age of 3. 5 to 6 years showed individual differences in SFON at the ages of 4, 5 and 6 years, as well as stability in <b>children.</b> <b>s</b> SFON across tasks used at different ages. The counting skills were assessed at the ages of 3. 5, 5 and 6 years. Path analyses indicated a reciprocal tendency in the relationship between SFON and counting development. In Study III, these results on the individual differences in SFON tendency, the stability of SFON across different tasks and the relationship of SFON and mathematical skills were confirmed by a larger-scale cross-sectional study of 183 on average 6. 5 -year-old children (range 6; 0 - 7; 0 years). The significant amount of unique variance that SFON accounted for number sequence elaboration, object counting and basic arithmetic skills stayed statistically significant (partial correlations varying from. 27 to. 37) when the effects of non-verbal IQ and verbal comprehension were controlled. In addition, to confirm that the SFON tasks assess SFON tendency independently from enumeration skills, guided focusing tasks were used for children who had failed in SFON tasks. It was explored whether these children were able to proceed in similar tasks to SFON tasks once they were guided to focus on number. The results showed that these <b>children.</b> <b>s</b> poor performance in the SFON tasks was not caused by their deficiency in executing the tasks but on lacking focusing on numerosity. The longitudinal Study IV of 39 children aimed at increasing the knowledge of associations between <b>children.</b> <b>s</b> long-term SFON tendency, subitizing-based enumeration and verbal counting skills. Children were tested twice at the age of 4 - 5 years on their SFON, and once at the age of 5 on their subitizing-based enumeration, number sequence production, as well as on their skills for counting of objects. Results showed considerable stability in SFON tendency measured at different ages, and that there is a positive direct association between SFON and number sequence production. The association between SFON and object counting skills was significantly mediated by subitizing-based enumeration. These results indicate that the associations between the <b>child.</b> <b>s</b> SFON and sub-skills of verbal counting may differ on the basis of how significant a role understanding the cardinal meanings of number words plays in learning these skills. The specific goal of Study V was to investigate whether it is possible to enhance 3 -year old <b>children.</b> <b>s</b> SFON tendency, and thus start <b>children.</b> <b>s</b> deliberate practice in early mathematical skills. Participants were 3 -year-old children in Finnish day care. The SFON scores and cardinality-related skills of the experimental group of 17 children were compared to the corresponding results of the 17 children in the control group. The results show an experimental effect on SFON tendency and subsequent development in cardinality-related skills during the 6 -month period from pretest to delayed posttest in the children with some initial SFON tendency in the experimental group. Social interaction has an effect on <b>children.</b> <b>s</b> SFON tendency. The results of the five studies assert that within a <b>child.</b> <b>s</b> existing mathematical competence, it is possible to distinguish a separate process, which refers to the <b>child.</b> <b>s</b> tendency to spontaneously focus on numerosity. Moreover, there are significant individual differences in <b>children.</b> <b>s</b> SFON at the age of 3 - 7 years. Moderate stability was found in this tendency across different tasks assessed both at the same and at different ages. Furthermore, SFON tendency is related to the development of early mathematical skills. Educational implications of the findings emphasise, first, the importance of regarding focusing on numerosity as a separate, essential process in the assessments of young <b>children.</b> <b>s</b> mathematical skills. Second, the substantial individual differences in SFON tendency during the childhood years suggest that uncovering and modeling this kind of mathematically meaningful perceiving of the surroundings and tasks could be an efficient tool for promoting young <b>children.</b> <b>s</b> mathematical development, and thus prevent later failures in learning mathematical skills. It is proposed to consider focusing on numerosity as one potential sub-process of activities involving exact number recognition in future studies...|$|R

As the teacher researcher I present an insider perspective, my world view on how I improved my pedagogical practices {{in order to gain}} a deeper understanding of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> learning, and my role in supporting <b>children</b> <b>s</b> learning. This study has two components, a) the writer as the teacher researcher and, b) accessibility of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> portfolios and the involvement of children in the portfolio process. This study uses a qualitative research design, a mixed methodology of self-study action research and case study. Three theories, ecological, sociocultural, and Donald Schön s (1983) theory of learning and practice have informed and guided this research. This eclectic mix of theoretical frameworks provided me with some valuable insights on ways of examining and using portfolios with children, and understanding <b>children</b> <b>s</b> views on their portfolios. The findings in this study are particular to the centre where I worked and they may not be generalisable to other early childhood care and education centres. Nonetheless, my experiences highlight the potential importance of the process and issues that arise from making portfolios accessible. The findings revealed that my experiences of engaging in self-study action research promoted within the centre a community of learners, and an enquiry approach to teaching and learning. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} making portfolios freely available provides children with an understanding of the purpose, contents and ownership of their portfolios. When children frequently use and share their portfolios with peers and teachers it can promote critical self-reflection and self-assessment of their learning. Involving children in the portfolio process makes visible to children the value of their contributions to their learning. Overall, this study has significantly improved my pedagogical practices. It has enhanced teachers learning which has in turn, benefited the <b>children</b> <b>s</b> learning. Beyond that, making the portfolios accessible has strengthened parental understanding of their <b>children</b> <b>s</b> experiences at the centre...|$|R
