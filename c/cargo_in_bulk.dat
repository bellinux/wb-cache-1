25|$|A full {{container}} load (FCL) is an ISO {{standard container}} that is loaded and unloaded under the risk and account of one shipper and only one consignee. In practice, {{it means that the}} whole container is intended for one consignee. FCL container shipment tends to have lower freight rates than an equivalent weight of <b>cargo</b> <b>in</b> <b>bulk.</b> FCL is intended to designate a container loaded to its allowable maximum weight or volume, but FCL in practice on ocean freight does not always mean a full payload or capacity - many companies will prefer to keep a 'mostly' full container as a single container load to simplify logistics and increase security compared to sharing a container with other goods.|$|E

50|$|The Vikings built many unique {{types of}} watercraft, {{often used for}} more {{peaceful}} tasks. The knarr was a dedicated merchant vessel designed to carry <b>cargo</b> <b>in</b> <b>bulk.</b> It had a broader hull, deeper draught, and {{a small number of}} oars (used primarily to manoeuvre in harbours and similar situations). One Viking innovation was the 'beitass', a spar mounted to the sail that allowed their ships to sail effectively against the wind. It was common for seafaring Viking ships to tow or carry a smaller boat to transfer crews and cargo from the ship to shore.|$|E

5000|$|Tankers are a {{relatively}} new concept, dating from the later years of the 19th century. Before this, technology had simply not supported the idea of carrying bulk liquids. The market was also not geared towards transporting or selling <b>cargo</b> <b>in</b> <b>bulk,</b> therefore most ships carried {{a wide range of}} different products in different holds and traded outside fixed routes. Liquids were usually loaded in casks—hence the term [...] "tonnage", which refers to the volume of the holds in terms of how many tuns or casks of wine could be carried. Even potable water, vital for the survival of the crew, was stowed in casks. Carrying bulk liquids in earlier ships posed several problems: ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The 3 D {{visualization}} {{technology is}} a kind of means and methods to achieve the human-computer interaction. Instead of the discrete objects in container terminal yard, the <b>cargo</b> <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> terminal yard is always being a form with particle. This paper gives a method which integrates modeling manually and real-time reconstruction automatically to achieve 3 D visualization of bulk terminal yard. Since to meet the requirement of real-time rendering and also decision data computing fast, this paper designs the data structure to describe the digital stockpile formed with a hierarchy relationship between surfaces, sections and space points, and also considers the closest distance as the main condition for searching and updating an old section, to visualize the working process in bucket terminal yard. Introductions Visualization technology originated the requirement of massive data processing in the field of scientific computing [1] [2] [3], which will digitize the objects in real world by the subjects of computer graphics, image processing, ergonomics and so on. It presents the complex information by the 3 D models. Meanwhile, it makes humans to understand the logic relationships between a lo...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{rise in the}} {{flows of}} {{dangerous}} <b>cargo</b> shipped <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> by sea has in some cases led to {{a rise in the}} explosion hazards onboard the ships that carry products that may release flammable vapors. This hazard is especially accentuated during loading, unloading and cleaning operations which may encourage the formation of an explosive atmosphere (ATEX) in the storage tanks. In parallel with the safety of such vessels, aspects relating to crew protection and safety must be taken into account. The new Maritime Labor Convention adopted in 2006 opens the way to social standardization for the seafaring world. In 2003, while conducting a joint technical and organizational investigation into the explosion onboard the petroleum product (gasoline and kerosene) tanker M/T Chassiron, INERIS and the Office of Investigation into Events at Sea identified the advantage of ensuring that this kind of oil tanker displacing less than 20, 000 tons be inerted as part of the prevention of the formation of an ATEX environment in line with European Directive ATEX 1999 / 92 /CE[1] relating to the minimum stipulations aimed at improving the safety and welfare protection of workers who may be exposed to explosive atmosphere hazard...|$|R

Dry cargo can be transported <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> by bulk carriers, packed directly onto a general <b>cargo</b> ship <b>in</b> break-bulk, packed in intermodal containers as aboard a container ship, or driven aboard as in roll-on roll-off ships. Liquid cargo is generally carried <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> aboard tankers, {{such as oil}} tankers which may include both crude and finished products of oil, chemical tankers which may also carry vegetable oils other than chemicals and LPG/LNG tankers, although smaller shipments may be carried on container ships in tank containers.|$|R

25|$|Following the American Revolution, many ships used as privateers {{were too}} large for short voyages in the {{coasting}} trade, and their owners determined to open new avenues of trade to distant countries. The young men of the town, fresh from service on the armed ships of Salem, were eager to embark in such ventures. Captain Nathaniel Silsbee, his first mate Charles Derby, and second mate Richard J. Cleveland were not yet twenty years old when they set sail on a nineteen-month voyage that was perhaps the first from the newly independent America to the East Indies. In 1795, Captain Jonathan Carnes set sail for Sumatra in the Malay Archipelago on his secret voyage for pepper; nothing was heard from him until eighteen months later, when he entered with a <b>cargo</b> of pepper <b>in</b> <b>bulk,</b> {{the first to be}} so imported into the country, and which sold at the extraordinary profit of seven hundred per cent. The Empress of China, formerly a privateer, was refitted as the first American ship to sail from New York to China. By 1790, Salem had become the sixth largest city in the country, and a world-famous seaport—particularly in the China Trade, along with exporting codfish to Europe and the West Indies, importing sugar and molasses from the West Indies, tea from China, and products depicted on the city seal from the East Indies – in particular Sumatran pepper. Salem ships also visited Africa – Zanzibar in particular, Russia, Japan, and Australia.|$|R
