50|$|The Maksutov-Cassegrain is a {{variation}} of the Maksutov telescope named after the Soviet/Russian optician and astronomer Dmitri Dmitrievich Maksutov. It starts with an optically transparent <b>corrector</b> <b>lens</b> that is a section of a hollow sphere. It has a spherical primary mirror, and a spherical secondary that in this application is usually a mirrored section of the <b>corrector</b> <b>lens.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The 1.0 m Swope Telescope was {{the first}} {{telescope}} installed at LCO, and began operating in 1971. It is named after CIS astronomer Henrietta Swope. It is a Ritchey-Chrétien telescope built by Boller & Chivens with a Gascoigne <b>corrector</b> <b>lens.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The 2.5 m du Pont Telescope {{is named}} after {{industrialist}} Irénée du Pont {{and has been in}} operation since 1977. It is a Ritchey-Chrétien telescope with a Gascoigne <b>corrector</b> <b>lens,</b> and was built by Boller & Chivens and L&F Industries.|$|E
50|$|The {{technical}} difficulties {{associated with the}} production of Schmidt corrector plates led some designers, such as Dmitri Dmitrievich Maksutov and Albert Bouwers, {{to come up with}} alternative designs using more conventional Meniscus <b>corrector</b> <b>lenses.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The H127 is a 1.27 m {{diameter}} reflector of modified Ritchey-Chrétien design, on an equatorial fork mount. The H127 has {{a rotating}} tertiary mirror and wide-field <b>corrector</b> <b>lenses</b> installed at two folded Cassegrain (Nasmyth) focal stations, allowing rapid switching between instruments. The H127 was {{donated to the}} University of Tasmania by Mr Caisey Harlingten.|$|R
50|$|The {{secondary}} {{mirror in the}} Lurie-Houghton {{is comparable to the}} {{secondary mirror}} in a Newtonian telescope. An advantage of the Lurie-Houghton over the Newtonian is that the secondary mirror can be mounted to one of the <b>corrector</b> <b>lenses</b> thus eliminating the spider mount. This eliminates diffraction of the incoming light that is caused by the vanes of the spider mount.|$|R
50|$|This {{design is}} based on the Maksutov-Cassegrain. It {{provides}} correction of aberrations via a two-element meniscus-shaped <b>corrector</b> <b>lens</b> in front of the secondary mirror. This design was originally envisaged by G. I. Popov with a practical implementation by Yu. A. Klevtsov. It is produced with apertures of 8, 10.25 and 13 inches. The 8-inch model employs a refractor style rack and pinion focuser, while in the larger designs the primary mirror is moved as in most other small to medium-sized Cassegrain designs.|$|E
50|$|Each {{surface of}} the lenses in the {{corrector}} creates a degree of freedom to correct optical aberrations. There are enough degrees of freedom to correct for spherical aberration, coma, and field curvature. The total power of the Houghton <b>corrector</b> <b>lens</b> is by definition zero. It {{is used in the}} path of the incoming light rays, which are parallel, so the residual chromatic aberration is essentially zero. The Houghton corrector can be made of the same type of glass (usually BK7) which reduces cost. The design tolerances are very modest compared to e.g., Maksutov telescopes.|$|E
50|$|To avoid a {{conflict}} with a design patent held by John Gregory licensed to Perkin-Elmer, Braymer put the secondary spot on the outer (R1) surface of the <b>corrector</b> <b>lens.</b> In the mid-1960s the patent issue was settled, and Questar’s Maksutov-Cassegrains after that time use the Gregory design with the aluminized spot {{on the inside of}} the corrector (R2). The design was originally envisioned as a 5 in telescope, but it was decided a telescope of that size would not fit the market they were aiming for, since it would be too heavy and expensive.|$|E
50|$|The camera {{will include}} three <b>corrector</b> <b>lenses</b> to reduce aberrations. The first lens at 1.55m {{diameter}} {{will be the}} largest lens ever built, and the third lens will form the vacuum window in front of the focal plane. The focal plane is flat, 64 cm in diameter, and will be a mosaic of 189 CCD detectors each of 16 megapixels, providing for better than 0.2 arcsecond sampling. The CCDs will be cooled to approx -100°C.|$|R
40|$|A {{model for}} a new {{electron}} vortex beam production method is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The technique calls on the controlled manipulation of the degrees of freedom of the lens aberrations to achieve a helical phase front. These degrees of freedom are accessible by using the <b>corrector</b> <b>lenses</b> of a transmission electron microscope. The vortex beam is produced through a particular alignment of these lenses into a specifically designed astigmatic state and applying an annular aperture in the condensor plane. Experimental results {{are found to be}} in good agreement with simulations. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) uses a novel, three-mirror, {{telescope}} design {{feeding a}} camera system {{that includes a}} set of broad-band filters and three refractive <b>corrector</b> <b>lenses</b> to produce a flat field at the focal plane with a wide field of view. Optical design of the camera lenses and filters is integrated in with the optical design of telescope mirrors to optimize performance. We discuss {{the rationale for the}} LSST camera optics design, describe the methodology for fabricating, coating, mounting and testing the lenses and filters, and present the results of detailed analyses demonstrating that the camera optics will meet their performance goals...|$|R
5000|$|The Baker-Nunn design, by Dr. Baker and Joseph Nunn, {{replaced}} the Baker-Schmidt camera's corrector {{plate with a}} small triplet <b>corrector</b> <b>lens</b> closer to {{the focus of the}} camera. It used a 55 mm wide film derived from the Cinemascope 55 motion picture process. A dozen f/0.75 Baker-Nunn cameras with 20-inch apertures [...] - [...] each weighing 3.5 tons including a multiple axis mount allowing it to follow satellites in the sky [...] - [...] were used by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory to track artificial satellites from the late 1950s to mid-1970s.|$|E
50|$|At its Cassegrain focus, the VST hosts an imaging wide-field camera (OmegaCAM), {{comprising}} {{a mosaic}} of 32 2Kx4K CCDs (268 megapixels total), and produced by an international consortium between the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, and the ESO. Design features of OmegaCAM include four auxiliary CCD cameras, two for auto-guiding and two for on-line image analysis. Up to 12 filters can be used, ranging from ultraviolet to near-infrared. The entire detector system operates in vacuum at about -140 degrees Celsius behind a large dewar window. This window not only protects the detectors from air and moisture, but also acts as an additional <b>corrector</b> <b>lens.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In sub-aperture {{corrector}} designs, the corrector {{elements are}} usually at {{the focus of}} a much larger objective. These elements can be both lenses and mirrors, but since multiple surfaces are involved, achieving good aberration correction in these systems can be very complex. Examples of sub-aperture corrector catadioptric telescopes include the Argunov-Cassegrain telescope, the Klevtsov-Cassegrain telescope and sub-aperture corrector Maksutovs, which use as a [...] "secondary mirror" [...] an optical group consisting of lens elements and sometimes mirrors designed to correct aberration, as well as Jones-Bird Newtonian telescopes, which use a spherical primary mirror combined with a small <b>corrector</b> <b>lens</b> mounted near the focus.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanics}} of the camera consists of a filter changer with an 8-filter capacity and shutter. There is also an optical barrel that supports 5 <b>corrector</b> <b>lenses,</b> the largest of which is 98 cm in diameter. These components {{are attached to the}} CCD focal plane which is cooled to −100 °C with liquid nitrogen in order to reduce thermal noise in the CCDs. The focal plane is also kept in an extremely low vacuum of 10−6 Torr to prevent the formation of condensation on the sensors. The entire camera with lenses, filters, and CCDs weighs approximately 4 tons. When mounted at the prime focus it will be supported with a hexapod system allowing for real time focal adjustment.|$|R
50|$|The Lurie-Houghton {{telescope}} is a catadioptric telescope. Lurie modified {{the original design}} by Houghton by adding a diagonal mirror to direct the focused light outside the telescope tube as in a Newtonian telescope. The Houghton design was patented on May 30, 1944. Instead of the fairly hard to make Schimdt and Maksutov <b>corrector</b> <b>lenses,</b> the <b>corrector</b> for the Lurie-Houghton {{is relatively easy to}} make. It consists of two lenses, a positive and a negative, {{at the front of the}} telescope which sets the size of the aperture. All lens and primary mirror surfaces are spheroidal which eases construction. These lenses are relatively thin, though not as thin as the Schmidt corrector. With a good antireflection coating, light loss and reflections are minimal.|$|R
5000|$|For an {{infrared}} camera, {{it is also}} vital to block heat radiation from the telescope and dome. This is accomplished by a sequence of cooled baffles {{in front of the}} field <b>corrector</b> <b>lenses.</b> Also, the secondary mirror is undersized to avoid edge detectors viewing warm structure outside the edge of the primary; this means the aperture seen by any point in the image plane is 3.7 m. This design requires the camera's vacuum cryostat [...] - [...] which cools the detectors as well as the baffles [...] - [...] to be more than 2 m long, with a front window of 95 cm diameter. A filter wheel {{just in front of the}} detectors allows the selection of a particular infrared wavelength range.|$|R
5000|$|In 1957, Gregory {{published}} an article in Sky & Telescope magazine entitled [...] "A Cassegrainian-Maksutov Telescope Design for the Amateur".In it, Gregory showed how to construct {{a version of the}} Maksutov catadioptric telescope in which all optical surfaces are spherical, and which has as secondary a small aluminized spot on the inner surface of the <b>corrector</b> <b>lens.</b> Not only was Gregory's design simpler than the classical Maksutov design; it also had the advantage of fixing the alignment of the secondary, making the telescope more robust, and eliminating the need for a secondary support that would otherwise cause diffraction spikes in the image. Most Maksutov telescopes manufactured today are of this type, which has come to be called either a [...] "Gregory-Maksutov" [...] or a [...] "Spot-Maksutov".|$|E
5000|$|Maksutov's most {{well known}} {{contribution}} {{in the field}} of optics was made in 1941, when he invented the Maksutov telescope. Like the Schmidt telescope, the Maksutov corrects for spherical aberration by placing a <b>corrector</b> <b>lens</b> in front of the primary mirror. However, where the Schmidt uses an aspheric corrector at the entrance pupil, Maksutov's telescope uses a deeply curved full diameter negative meniscus lens (a [...] "meniscus corrector shell"). He published the design in 1944 in a paper entitled [...] "Новые катадиоптрические менисковые системы" [...] catadioptric meniscus systems. This method was adopted not only by his own laboratory for many of the most important observatories in the Soviet Union, but also internationally. Several commercial telescope-making companies produce Maksutovs, including Celestron, Meade, and Questar.|$|E
5000|$|A Jones-Bird Newtonian {{telescope}} (sometimes {{called a}} Bird-Jones) is a mirror-lens (catadioptric) {{variation on the}} traditional design sold in the amateur telescope market. The design uses a spherical primary mirror {{in place of a}} parabolic one, with spherical aberrations corrected by sub-aperture <b>corrector</b> <b>lens</b> usually mounted inside the focusser tube or in front of the secondary mirror. This design reduces the size and cost of the telescope with a shorter overall telescope tube length (with the corrector extending the focal length in a [...] "telephoto" [...] type layout) combined with a less costly spherical mirror. Commercially produced versions of this design have been noted to be optically compromised due to the difficulty of producing a correctly shaped sub-aperture corrector in a telescope targeted at the inexpensive end of the telescope market.|$|E

In this paper we describe the opto-mechanical alignment procedure of the 2. 61 m primary mirror, the secondary and <b>correctors</b> <b>lenses</b> onto the mechanical structure of the telescope. The alignment procedure does not rely on the mechanical precision of the mirrors.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Corrector</b> <b>lens</b> {{assembly}} is used {{to expand}} {{the field of view}} of a Cassegrain Telescope. There are usually three to five lenses in it. For the assembly of such a kind of high precision optics, decenter and tilt of each optical component and air space between components are key issues to be qualified. In the present study, four lenses were designed. Individual control of centering of the component and air space were achieved by assembling the component into a precision machined subcell. The lens positions were defined by precision spacers according to the designed values. To compensate various thermal expansions of glass and metal, elastomer material was used. Considering the deviation of manufacturing from design data, manufactured data were put into optical software for re-optimization, and air spaces between lenses were obtained. This gives excellent accuracy at low cost. Base on present lens mounting design and lens manufacturing quality, centering error was eliminated by lateral adjustment, which leaded to a good alignment. In this paper, the method for aligning the optics with the barrel assembly is presented and centering error measured by a double autocollimator is listed. In addition, test results of thermal cycling and vibration tests on the <b>corrector</b> <b>lens</b> assembly are discussed...|$|E

40|$|A 2. 5 degree field {{diameter}} <b>corrector</b> <b>lens</b> {{design for}} the Cassegrain focus of the VISTA 4 meter telescope is presented. It comprises four single elements of glasses with high UV transmission, all axi-symmetric for operation at the zenith. One element is displaced laterally to provide atmospheric dispersion correction. A key feature, especially beneficial for the VISTA application, is that the ADC element can be mounted so it is driven simply by gravity; thus its operation needs no motors, encoders, cabling, or software control.

40|$|Abstract. During {{the last}} years the use of {{tracking}} cameras for SLR observations became less important due to the high accuracy of the predicted orbits. Upcoming new targets like satellites in eccentric orbits and space debris objects, however, require tracking cameras again. In 2013 the interline CCD camera was replaced at the Zimmerwald Observatory with a so called scientific CMOS camera. This technology promises a better performance for this application than all kinds of CCD cameras. After the comparison of the different technologies the {{focus will be on}} the integration in the Zimmerwald SLR system. Zimlat The 1 ‐meter Zimmerwald Laser and Astronometry Telescope (ZIMLAT) was installed in 1997. It allows for state‐of‐the‐art satellite laser ranging (SLR) and also serves as astronomical telescope for the optical observation of astrometric positions and magnitudes of near‐Earth objects, such as space debris, using Charge Coupled Device (CCD) or Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) cameras. The telescope is monostatic w. r. t. SLR (transmit and receive paths are identical between the primary mirror and the transmit/receive mirror located {{at the lower end of}} the Coudé path). The dichroic mirror (DBS) located in the fork of the mount (Figure 1) allows for the use of tracking cameras simultaneously with SLR observations. The Deflection Mirror (DM) is used to select one of 4 <b>corrector</b> <b>lenses</b> and cameras. The focal length varies between 1 m, 4 m and 8 m. Figure 1.

50|$|The {{spacecraft}} has {{a mass of}} 1039 kg {{and contains}} a Schmidt camera with a 0.95 m front <b>corrector</b> plate (<b>lens)</b> feeding a 1.4 m primary mirror - {{at the time of}} its launch this was the largest mirror on any telescope outside Earth orbit, though the Herschel Space Observatory took this title a few months later. The spacecraft has a 115 deg2 (about 12-degree diameter) field of view (FOV), roughly equivalent to the size of one's fist held at arm's length. Of this, 105 deg2 is of science quality, with less than 11% vignetting. The photometer has a soft focus to provide excellent photometry, rather than sharp images. The mission goal is a combined differential photometric precision (CDPP) of 20 ppm for a m(V)=12 Sun-like star for a 6.5-hour integration, though the observations so far have fallen short of this objective (see mission status). An Earth-size planet transit produces a brightness change of 84 ppm and lasts for thirteen hours when it crosses the midline of the star.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Efficient {{collection}} and analysis of trapped ion qubit fluorescence is essential for robust qubit state detection in trapped ion quantum computing schemes. We discuss simple techniques of improving photon collection efficiency using high numerical aperture (N. A.) reflective optics. To test these techniques we placed a spherical mirror with an effective N. A. of about 0. 9 inside a vacuum chamber {{in the vicinity of}} a linear Paul trap. We demonstrate stable and reliable trapping of single barium ions, in excellent agreement with our simulations of the electric field in this setup. While a large N. A. spherical mirror introduces significant spherical aberration, the ion image quality can be greatly improved by a specially designed aspheric <b>corrector</b> <b>lens</b> located outside the vacuum system. Our simulations show that the spherical mirror/corrector design is an easy and cost-effective way to achieve high photon collection rates when compared to a more sophisticated parabolic mirror setup...|$|E

The oblique electron lens is well suited to ultraviolet and vacuum ultraviolet image converters, and to image converters employing opaque negative electron affinity photocathodes. It is also possible to use this oblique electron lens for electronography.
