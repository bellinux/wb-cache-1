Methods To assess <b>the</b> accuracy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CPR <b>registry,</b> CCTV clips <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room in which CPR was performed in the ED and <b>the</b> corresponding CPR <b>registry</b> were consecutively collected and reviewed. <b>The</b> <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>registry,</b> specifically <b>the</b> time interval between patient arrival and CPR procedures, were compared with those determined by the CCTV clips.

Methods: To develop the Measures Registry—a searchable online tool of childhood obesity measures—NCCOR conducted a literature review of all articles with relevant measures published between 2004 and 2010. Measures were categorized according to four domains: individual dietary behavior, individual physical activity behavior, food environment, and physical activity environment. Subject matter experts abstracted all articles using a standardized form that included details on validity, reliability, health outcomes, protocols for use and scoring, and other specifics regarding the populations in which the measures were used. Expert panelists and focus groups determined layout design preferences and functionality. Results: Over 900 measures are included in <b>the</b> Measures <b>Registry</b> (available at www. nccor. org/measures) and about 150 of these measures are available for download at <b>the</b> <b>Registry</b> site. Measures are defined broadly as tools and methodologies to assess individual diet, physical activity, and the environments in which these behaviors occur. Examples <b>of</b> measures in <b>the</b> <b>Registry</b> include questionnaires, instruments, diaries, logs, electronic devices, direct observation of people or environments, protocols, and analytic techniques. The tool will be updated regularly and additional evaluation is planned to optimize use. Conclusions: <b>The</b> Measures <b>Registry</b> is intended to facilitate access to existing measures in childhood obesity research, identify gaps, and fuel the development and validation of new measures.

Our experience shows research resources like databases are dynamic objects, that can change location and scope over time. Although each record is entered manually and human-curated, <b>the</b> current size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>registry</b> requires tools that can aid in curation efforts to keep content up to date, including when and where such resources are used. To address this challenge, we have developed an open source tool suite, collectively termed RDW: Resource Disambiguator for the (Web).

We established a clinical registry (SpineData) {{in a conservative}} care setting where more than 10, 000 new cases of spinal pain are assessed each year. This paper describes <b>the</b> SpineData <b>registry,</b> summarizes <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> its clinical population and data, and signals <b>the</b> availability <b>of</b> these data {{as a resource for}} collaborative research projects. Methods: <b>The</b> SpineData <b>registry</b> is an Internet-based system that captures patient data electronically at <b>the</b> point <b>of</b> clinical contact. <b>The</b> setting is the government-funded Medical Department <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spine Centre <b>of</b> Southern Denmark, Hospital Lillebaelt, where patients receive a multidisciplinary assessment of their chronic spinal pain. Results: Started in 2011, the database by early 2015 contained information on more than 36, 300 baseline episodes of patient care, plus the available 6 -month and 12 -month follow-up data for these episodes. The baseline questionnaire completion rate has been 93 %; 79 % of people were presenting with low back pain as their main complaint, 6 % with mid-back pain, and 15 % with neck pain. Collectively, across the body regions and measurement time points, there are approximately 1, 980 patient-related variables in the database across a broad range of biopsychosocial factors. To date, 36 research projects have used data from <b>the</b> SpineData <b>registry,</b> including collaborations with researchers from Denmark, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Brazil. Conclusion: We described the aims, development, structure, and <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SpineData <b>registry,</b> and what is known about any attrition bias and cluster effects in the data.

40|$|Ambient Networks (AN) {{is a new}} {{networking}} {{concept for}} beyond 3 G. It is a product <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European Union's Sixth Framework Program (FP 6). Network composition is a core concept of ANs. It allows dynamic, scalable and uniform cooperation between heterogeneous networks. ANs can host various registries. These registries may be of different types (e. g. centralized, distributed), store heterogeneous types of information (e. g. raw data vs. aggregated data), and rely on different interfaces to access the stored information (i. e. protocols or programming interfaces). When ANs compose, <b>the</b> hosted <b>registries</b> need to compose. Registry composition is a sub-process of network composition. It provides seamless and autonomous access to <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>registries</b> in <b>the</b> composed network. This thesis proposes a new architecture for registry composition in ANs. This overall architecture {{is made up of}} four components: interface interworking, data interworking, negotiation and signaling. Interface interworking enables dynamic intercommunication between registries with heterogeneous interfaces. Data interworking involves dynamically overcoming data heterogeneity (e. g. format and granularity). Interface and data interworking go beyond static interworking using gateways, as done today. The negotiation component allows <b>the</b> negotiation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> composition agreement. Signaling coordinates and regulates the negotiation and <b>the</b> execution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> composition agreement. Requirements are derived and related work is reviewed. We propose a new functional entity and a new procedure to orchestrate the composition process. We also propose a new architecture for interface interworking, based on a peer to peer overlay network. We have built a proof-of-concept prototype. The interface-interworking component is used as <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> our new architecture to data interworking. This architecture reuses mechanisms and algorithms from the federated data base area. The thesis proposes as well a new architecture for on-line negotiation. The architecture includes a template for composition agreement proposals, and a negotiation protocol that was validated using SPIN. A new signaling framework is also proposed. It is based on the IETF Next Step in Signaling (NSIS) framework and was validated using OPNET.
