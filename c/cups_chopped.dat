5000|$|A fairly modern {{development}} is the 'Chop Cup'. This cup has a magnet inside and a magnetic ball is used. The ball will stick in the top until the cup is set down with a little bump which releases the ball. The ball then [...] "appears" [...] when the cup is lifted. This cup was invented around 1954 by Al Wheatley who performed a Chinese-costumed act with the name [...] "Chop Chop". The <b>Chop</b> <b>Cup</b> is a variation with one cup and (apparently) one ball, hugely popular because it requires {{only a very small}} flat area to perform, unlike the considerable table space needed for the classic three-cup routine. The Chicago close-up magician Don Alan performed his streamlined <b>Chop</b> <b>Cup</b> routine on television and was immediately copied by magicians all over the world. Paul Daniels routine with the <b>chop</b> <b>cup</b> has also done a lot for the routine's popularity. The <b>Chop</b> <b>Cup</b> can be handled entirely by the top, creating a more impossible performance.|$|R
50|$|For the frosting: Two cups of {{granulated}} sugar {{and a cup}} {{and a half of}} water, boil until stringly, about five minutes usually does it. Beat the whites of two eggs very light, and pour the boiling sugar slowly into it, mixing well. Take out of this enough for the top and sides of the cake, and stir into the remainder for the filling between the two layers, one <b>cup</b> of finely <b>chopped</b> raisins and a <b>cup</b> of <b>chopped</b> nuts. This is delicious when properly baked.|$|R
5000|$|Two legendary {{names are}} {{associated}} with making the <b>chop</b> <b>cup</b> popular as they were their [...] "signature" [...] pieces — Don Alan and Jennings. History records that Wheatley saw Jennings perform his <b>chop</b> <b>cup</b> routine at The Magic Castle shortly after it opened in 1963. He was so impressed that he asked Jennings to please not reveal his method or routine in print until after his death. Jennings kept his promise, and did not publish his routine until a year after Wheatley's death. It was published in Genii Magazine, Volume 29, Number 7, in March 1965.|$|R

Recycled {{polystyrene}} (PS) <b>cups</b> were <b>chopped</b> up and separately incorporated with multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and NiZn ferrite (Ni 0. 6 Zn 0. 4 Fe 2 O 4) nanoparticles prior to electrospinning under different conditions. These nanoscale inclusions were initially dispersed well in dimethylformamide (DMF), and then known amounts of the recycled PS pieces {{were added to the}} dispersions prior to 30 min of sonication followed by 4 h of high-speed agitation at 750 r/min. The thermal, dielectric, surface hydrophobic, and magnetic properties of the resultant nanocomposite fibers were determined by thermal comparative, capacitance bridge, vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), and goniometer techniques, respectively. Test results confirmed that the physical properties of recycled nanofibers were significantly increased {{as a function of the}} inclusion concentrations, which may be because of their excellent properties. The consumption of polymeric products as well as their waste materials has dramatically grown worldwide. Although plastic recycling, reprocessing, and reusing rates are growing, the physical properties and economic value of recycled plastics are significantly low. Consequently, this work provides a detailed explanation of how to improve recycled plastics, making them into highly valued new nanoproducts for various industrial applications, including filtration, textile, transportation, construction, and energy.

50|$|It is {{recommended}} that the Belgian Hare, like other rabbits, receive a standard intake of 2 <b>cups</b> of <b>chopped</b> dark, green, leafy vegetables per 6 pounds of body weight (although this should only be given after four months of age to prevent enteritis) and up to 2 tablespoons of fruit or carrots per 6 pounds of body weight daily. It is common for some owners to provide treats, although in very limited quantities, which can include a few pellets, a slice of strawberry, or other healthful foods. Commercial treats {{are available in the}} pet stores can be fed, but owners should stay away from anything with a yoghurt coating, or other ingredients that the rabbit would not encounter in the wild.Some of the vegetables that rabbits enjoy are romaine lettuce, escarole, turnips, collards, kale, parsley, thyme, cilantro, dandelion, and basil. The green, leafy tops of radish and carrots also are excellent sources of nutrients, but should be fed sparingly due to the high calcium content. New vegetables should be introduced slowly due to the delicate digestive systems of rabbits. It {{is recommended}} that cauliflower, broccoli and cabbage be avoided, as they cause gas and can lead to gastrointestinal stasis, which can be fatal. Vegetables such as potatoes and corn should also avoided due to their high starch content. Belgian Hares also require an unlimited amount of fresh water, usually provided for in a water crock, tip-proof ceramic pet dish, or hanging water bottle.|$|R
40|$|AbstractKale is a nutrient-dense, dark-green leafy {{vegetable}} often eaten raw in salads or added to smoothies. The USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference Release 26 reports the weight for one <b>cup</b> raw, <b>chopped</b> kale as 67 grams, {{among the highest}} for raw {{leafy vegetable}}s. Objectives: Measure the weight of one cup moderately packed raw kale with stems and tough midrib parts removed and evaluate {{the impact of the}} new cup weight on nutrient intake of individuals consumingraw kale. Methods: Six staff members measured curly and lacinato kale using standard procedures and 14 study participantsconsuming 4 - 6 cups raw leafy vegetables/day measured one cup curly kale in their usual manner. Twenty-seven dietary recalls obtained from participants following the Wahls™ diet were entered intothe Nutrition Data System for Research and then recalculated using staff-measured curly kale cup weight. Results: Mean(SE) staff cup weight for lacinato kale was significantly higher than curly kale [21. 3 (1. 4) g vs 16. 0 (1. 4) g; p< 0. 0001]. Percent refuse was also higher for lacinato kale [mean(SD) 42. 0 (11. 4) % vs 28. 5 (3. 9) %; p= 0. 012]. Mean(SD) weight of moderately packed participant-measured cups [17. 5 (6. 4) g]was similar to staff cup weightbutfirmly packed participant cupsweighed more [46. 4 (4. 1) g]. Intake of vitamins K, C, A, manganese, copper, and folatewere significantly lower for diets calculated with the staff cup weight (p< 0. 0001). Conclusions: The new measured cup weight of raw kale is lower than previously reportedand reduces nutrient levels in diets containing raw kale. Verification of cup weights for other raw leafy vegetables may be warranted...|$|R
