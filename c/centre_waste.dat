40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to characterising energy consumption in IT service centres comprising the whole system view, from the IT infrastructures, to the applications and their design and execution environments. The approach {{is based on a}} set of energy-related metrics called Green Performance Indicators (GPIs) which enable monitoring the energy consumption level of the IT service centre in terms of computing resource usage, impact on the environment, costs/efforts required to develop and redesign applications and reconfiguring the IT-infrastructure. Our approach, which is framed within the EU Project GAMES [15] about green IT, defines four layers of GPIs allowing for a comprehensive description of energy consumptions at various system levels, in relation to a given Quality of Service (QoS), to impact on the environment (consumables, power, emissions, cooling systems, and so on) and to high-level business objectives. These GPI metrics are defined to measure the “greenness” of a computing environment, and more precisely, to detect where the IT service <b>centre</b> <b>wastes</b> energy. The monitoring and evaluation of GPIs allows the introduction of energy efficiency measures through interventions at various levels (e. g., improving IT resource usage or changing the QoS), allowing for an adaptation and optimisation of the according execution modes...|$|R

Purpose of this study was to obtain information on waste separation in individual households as well as information on whether individuals are aware of the importance of a proper segregation of waste. With this research I wanted to determine whether it is possible for an individual household to collecte seperate waste and whether respondents are aware of the role and activities of the centers for waste management. I was also wondering what respondents think about waste management in the context of the sustainable development concept. The survey involved 102 respondents between the ages of 12 and 74 years. The results showed that people are aware of the issue of inappropriate waste treatement, as well as awareness that as consumers they can affect the daily accumulated amounts of waste. Despite good awareness of people about proper waste separation there is still too little awareness about the work of the <b>centres</b> for <b>waste</b> management. In addition to waste collectioning the work of centers for waste management is also sorting of waste, composting, mechanical biological treatment, treatment of bulky waste, sorting of mixed waste and separately collectioning of fractions, removal of recyclable materials in the reprocessing and waste disposal.

40|$|This {{research}} discusses a South African {{case study}} for the potential of utilizing refuse-derived fuel (RDF) obtained from non-burn treatment of health care risk waste (HCRW) as potential feedstock for green energy production. This specific waste stream can be destroyed via non-burn treatment technology involving high-speed mechanical shredding followed by steam or chemical injection to disinfect the final product. The RDF obtained from this process is characterised by a low moisture, low ash, and high calorific value which means it can be potentially used as high-value solid fuel. Due to the raw feed of this RDF being classified as hazardous, the final RDF {{has been reported to}} be non-infectious and can blend with other combustible wastes such as rubber and plastic for waste to energy applications. This study evaluated non-burn treatment technology as a possible solution for on-site destruction of HCRW in South African private and public health care <b>centres.</b> <b>Waste</b> generation quantities were estimated {{based on the number of}} registered patient beds, theoretical bed occupancy. Time and motion study was conducted to evaluate the logistics viability of on-site treatment. Non-burn treatment technology for HCRW is a promising option for South Africa, and successful implementation of this method depends upon the initial capital investment, operational cost and environmental permitting of such technology; there are other influencing factors such as the size of the waste stream, product off-take price as well as product demand...|$|R

40|$|Due {{to ongoing}} urbanisation, accumulating waste, traffic, noise and damage {{to human health}} {{environmental}} pollution occur more frequently in Croatian cities. It {{is to be expected}} that it will occur even more often due to increased migration to towns, urbanisation, construction and industrialization around bigger town areas. This problem is stressed in bigger towns along the Adriatic coast. In the summer months, due to big number of tourists, environmental impacts multiply, while the existing infrastructure (<b>waste</b> management <b>centres,</b> <b>waste</b> water treatment plans, water supply, noise and traffic infrastructure) minimally meet the increasing needs. Apart from the inadequate infrastructure, the EU environmental directives have not been fully transposed to Croatian legislation.

The level of institutional capacity for environmental management in urban areas is inadequate, especially with regard to the knowledge and experience in strategic planning and environmental management, as well as in public participation in the decision-making on environment.

40|$|Beneficial use {{of waste}} relies on {{efficient}} systems for collection and separation. In Sweden, a bring system involving recycling centres for collection of bulky, electr(on) ic and hazardous waste has been introduced. A significant share of this waste is incorrectly sorted, causing downstream environmental implications. At present, however, {{there is a lack}} of affordable and accurate monitoring methods for providing the recycling centres with the necessary facts for improving the sorting of waste. The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the usability of a simplified and potentially more suitable waste monitoring method for recycling centres. This method is based on standardised observations where the occurrence of incorrect sorting is monitored by taking digital pictures of the waste which then are analysed according to certain guidelines. The results show that the developed monitoring method could offer a resource-efficient and useful tool for proactive quality work at recycling centres, involving continuous efforts in developing and evaluating measures for improved sorting of waste. More research is however needed in order to determine to what extent the obtained results from the monitoring method are reliable.
