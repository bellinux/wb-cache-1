Years later, she told an audience: [...] "I was {{conductor}} of the Underground Railroad for eight years, and I <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> most conductors can't say – I never ran my train off the track and I never lost a passenger." [...] One of her last missions into Maryland was to retrieve her aging parents. Her father, Ben, had purchased Rit, her mother, in 1855 from Eliza Brodess for 20 dollars. But even when they were both free, the area became hostile to their presence. Two years later, Tubman received word that her father had harbored a group of eight escaped slaves, and was at risk of arrest. She traveled to the Eastern Shore and led them north to St. Catharines, Ontario, where a community of former slaves (including Tubman's brothers, other relatives, and many friends) had gathered.|$|E

Abraham Foxman, National Director of the Anti-Defamation League told the website: [...] "It's offensive. It's part of the unintended consequences of the communications revolution.

What they've done is distributed anti-Semitism – which started as a private conversation – and by putting it on a reality TV show broadcast it to the world at large. I want CBS to understand they are facilitating anti-Semitism. They should act responsibly to the community; they are legitimizing bigoted conversation." ...|$|E
