5|$|Before the 1928 Florida–Georgia game, Georgia fans trumpeted {{the return}} of center Ike Boland to bolster its defense. Florida's defense, however, {{rendered}} the Georgia Bulldogs' running game, including that of fullback Herdis McCrary, ineffective {{en route to a}} 26–6 victory. This was Florida's first victory over Georgia in seven match-ups and solidified the Gators as legitimate <b>contenders</b> <b>for</b> their first-ever conference title. Two Bulldogs' fumbles, and two Gators pass plays, accounted for Florida's four touchdowns.|$|E

5|$|In 1429, when Isabeau {{lived in}} English-occupied Paris, the {{accusation}} was again put forth that CharlesVII {{was not the}} son of CharlesVI. At that time, with two <b>contenders</b> <b>for</b> the French throne—the young HenryVI and disinherited Charles—this could have been propaganda {{to prop up the}} English claim. Furthermore, gossip spread that Joan of Arc was Isabeau and Orleans' illegitimate daughter—a rumor Gibbons finds improbable because Joan of Arc almost certainly was not born for some years after Orléans' assassination. Stories circulated that the dauphins were murdered, and attempts were made to poison the other children, all of which added to Isabeau's reputation of one of history's great villains.|$|E
5|$|In one of {{his final}} acts as governor, Letcher proclaimed the first thanksgiving day in Kentucky on September 26, 1844. After leaving office, he resumed his law {{practice}} in Frankfort.

He was replaced by Rey Mysterio, however, after Cena suffered a herniated disc in his neck, which required surgery. Cena underwent successful surgery to repair the injury.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 Giro {{featured}} {{an assortment}} of <b>contenders</b> <b>for</b> the overall victory. Defending champion Danilo Di Luca had faced potential bans which would have {{kept him out of}} the race, after investigations into his involvement with the Oil for Drugs scandal and an irregular doping test given after stage 17 of the 2007 Giro d'Italia, either of which could have resulted in a two-year suspension. Though he was suspended for three months because of Oil for Drugs, he was cleared by the Italian National Olympic Committee of any wrongdoing in the 2007 Giro, and was thus permitted to start.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} season, Ginóbili {{was injured}} {{for most of}} the campaign, managing only 44 regular season games and missing the 2009 NBA Playoffs entirely. San Antonio qualified for the playoffs as the third seed with a 54–28 record, but with an aging supporting cast (Bowen, Michael Finley and Kurt Thomas were all in their late 30s), the Spurs were only considered fringe <b>contenders</b> <b>for</b> the championship. As it turned out, the strong play of Duncan and Tony Parker were not enough to help the Spurs avoid a 4–1 defeat by Dallas, and the Spurs were eliminated {{in the first round of}} the playoffs for the first time since 2000.|$|E

Lemaitre and Chambers were seen as the only gold medal <b>contenders</b> <b>for</b> the 100 m final at the European Athletics Championships, but the event defied expectations in terms of times and placings. The Frenchman won in 10.11seconds into a headwind while a tight finish between the four following athletes (all 10.18) saw Chambers finish fifth.|$|E
