5000|$|When a kick (influx of {{formation}} fluid) occurs, rig operators or automatic systems {{close the}} blowout preventer units, sealing the annulus {{to stop the}} flow of fluids out of the wellbore. Denser mud is then circulated into the wellbore down the drill string, up the annulus and out through the choke line {{at the base of the}} BOP stack through chokes (flow restrictors) until downhole pressure is overcome. Once “kill weight” mud extends from the bottom of the well to the top, the well has been “killed”. If the integrity of the well is intact drilling may be resumed. Alternatively, if circulation is not feasible it may be possible to kill the well by [...] "bullheading", forcibly pumping, in the heavier mud from the top through the kill line connection at the base of the stack. This is less desirable because of the higher surface pressures likely needed and the fact that much of the mud originally in the annulus must be forced into receptive formations in the open hole section beneath the deepest <b>casing</b> <b>shoe.</b>|$|E
50|$|DOGGR also {{maintains}} {{a database of}} active wells, expired wells, surveyed lands and leases on California land, coastal waters (0-3 miles) and federal Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). When a well is no longer needed, either because the oil or gas reservoir becomes depleted, or because no oil or gas was found (called a dry-hole), the well is plugged and abandoned. A well is plugged by placing cement in the well-bore or casing at certain intervals as specified in California laws or regulations. The purpose of the cement is to seal the wellbore or casing and prevent fluid from migrating between underground rock layers. Cement plugs are required to be placed across the oil or gas reservoir (zone plug), across the base-of-fresh-water (BFW plug), and at the surface (surface plug). Other cement plugs may be required {{at the bottom of}} a string of open <b>casing</b> (<b>shoe</b> plug), on top of tools that may become stuck down hole (junk plug), on top of cut casing (stub plug), or anywhere else where a cement plug may be needed. Also, the hole is filled with drilling mud to help prevent the migration of fluids.|$|E
50|$|The {{primary means}} of {{detecting}} a kick while drilling is a relative change in the circulation rate {{back up to the}} surface into the mud pits. The drilling crew or mud engineer keeps track of the level in the mud pits and/or closely monitors the rate of mud returns versus the rate that is being pumped down the drill pipe. Upon encountering a zone of higher pressure than is being exerted by the hydrostatic head of the drilling mud (including the small additional frictional head while circulating) at the bit, an increase in mud return rate would be noticed as the formation fluid influx blends in with the circulating drilling mud. Conversely, if the rate of returns is slower than expected, it means that a certain amount of the mud is being lost to a thief zone somewhere below the last <b>casing</b> <b>shoe.</b> This does not necessarily result in a kick (and may never become one); however, a drop in the mud level might allow influx of formation fluids from other zones if the hydrostatic head at is reduced to less than that of a full column of mud.|$|E
5000|$|Mud logs {{are well}} logs {{prepared}} by describing rock or soil cuttings {{brought to the}} surface by mud circulating in the borehole. In the oil industry they are usually prepared by a mud logging company contracted by the operating company. One parameter a typical mud log displays is the formation gas (gas units or ppm). [...] "The gas recorder usually is scaled in terms of arbitrary gas units, which are defined differently by the various gas-detector manufactures. In practice, significance is placed only on relative changes in the gas concentrations detected." [...] The current oil industry standard mud log normally includes real-time drilling parameters such as rate of penetration (ROP), lithology, gas hydrocarbons, flow line temperature (temperature of the drilling fluid) and chlorides but may also include mud weight, estimated pore pressure and corrected d-exponent (corrected drilling exponent) for a pressure pack log. Other information that is normally notated on a mud log include directional data (deviation surveys), weight on bit, rotary speed, pump pressure, pump rate, viscosity, drill bit info, <b>casing</b> <b>shoe</b> depths, formation tops, mud pump info, {{to name just a}} few.|$|E

40|$|In 2006 the Petroleum Safety Authority Norway (PSA) {{performed}} a well integrity survey. The survey indicated that about 20 % of wells on the Norwegian Continental shelf (NCS) may suffer from well integrity issues. Most {{of the problems}} were related to deficiency in annulus safety valve, tubing, cement and casing. Pressure build-up in annulus, i. e. sustained casing pressure, {{is one of the}} main indicators of a significant well integrity problem. Increased understanding on the field may help engineers to design wells with better integrity in the future. This thesis describes SCP and its most common causes with emphasis on the relation between <b>casing</b> <b>shoe</b> setting depth and the occurrence of SCP. Primary and secondary barrier is described together with the common practice of choosing <b>casing</b> <b>shoe</b> depth. Formation strength and its impact on setting depth is explained together with a brief introduction of the different formation integrity tests. Generic cases have been studied to determine the relation between unfavorable <b>casing</b> <b>shoe</b> setting depth and the occurrence of SCP. For each case there is a suggestion as how the well may be redesigned so that the risk of SCP is reduced. Information on the theme has been acquired through studying and comparing different papers, booklets, previous reports and reviews concerning the subject. The Norsok standard D- 010 and 117 &# 150; OLF recommended guidelines for well integrity have also been very informative during the study. To be able to avoid SCP and at the same time improve well design, it is important to properly understand how SCP arises. Changing the <b>casing</b> <b>shoe</b> setting depth to a more suited depth or formation cannot alone eliminate SCP. To eliminate SCP a good conversion between Top of Cement (TOC) and setting depth of the previous <b>casing</b> <b>shoe</b> is required.

30|$|The rising {{speed of}} gas kick is an {{important}} parameter in well control operation.

30|$|Typically, a {{formation}} pressure integrity test or the formation leak-off test is performed in drilling operations to evaluate cement jobs, determine the casing setting depth, test {{the resistance of}} tensile failures of a <b>casing</b> <b>shoe,</b> and estimate formation fracture gradient (Postler 1997). Based on the injection pressure, volume, and time, pressure integrity tests can be classified into three, i.e., formation integrity test (FIT), leak-off test (LOT), and extended leak-off test (XLOT). The purpose of conducting a FIT is to test the formation fracture pressure required for kick tolerance and/or safe drilling mud weight margin.

40|$|The first relief wells emerged out of necessity, {{and have}} since been shaped by several {{disastrous}} events throughout the 20 th and 21 th century. The modern relief well shows {{little resemblance to the}} first relief wells that were drilled in the early 20 th century. Today?s relief wells are drilled to directly intersect a blowing wellbore at depths of several thousand meters, and often with a diameter of less than one foot. At these depths, conventional positioning surveying tools can yield horizontal errors approaching 100 meters, and therefore cannot offer the accuracy required to facilitate direct intersection between the two wells. Because of this, special survey tools have been developed to home in on the steel tubular in the blowing wellbore. Ranging Tools Two types of tools generally exist. Passive magnetostatic tools use conventional magnetic survey tools integrated into the bottomhole assembly to measure the remanent magnetism present in steel, and have a range of 15 meters. Active electromagnetic tools apply an alternating (AC) current to the blowing tubular to inducing a magnetic field around the blowing wellbore. This current can either be applied directly to the casing of the blowing well at the surface, or be injected into the subsurface formations through an injector electrode integrated into the tool. Under ideal conditions, a downhole sensor package can detect the magnetic field at a distance of 60 meters. This survey method traditionally requires a specialized electromagnetic survey string to be run into the hole. Wellbore Positioning Surveys To be able to utilize magnetic ranging instruments to home in on the casing of the blowing well, conventional surveys must be able to safely position the relief well within the maximum ranging distance from the blowing well. Considering uncertainty in wellbore position of both wells, this can be a challenge. Typical relief well strategies involves drilling towards the blowing well, using conventional magnetic positioning surveys integrated into the measurements while drilling (MWD) package. Before the large uncertainty makes premature interception possible, a gyro-survey is performed to reduce the positioning uncertainty. Once the wells are within the ranging distance from each other, the homing in process can start. Trajectory Requirements Generally it is desired to intersect the blowing well at a relatively narrow angle of between 3 and 15 º. Because of the surface conditions at the blowing well site, the relief well is often spudded more than one kilometer away. Because of these two conditions, the relief well is drilled at a high angle to approach the blowing well, and is dropped down to near parallel before intersection is made. To increase the accuracy of the homing-in tools, a triangulation approach is often utilized. This is performed by drilling the relief well past the blowing well, at a relative distance of around 10 meters, before it drops down and is drilled parallel to the target well. This technique can reduces the uncertainty of the homing-in measurements to below one meter. Once the wells are at this distance from each other, the pressure drawdown will most likely cause the formation between the wells to collapse, creating a direct hydraulic communication between the wells. Depth of Intersection Because of the inherent nature of the surveying techniques utilized to home in on the target, steel must be present in the blowing wellbore. Most often this means that the last set <b>casing</b> <b>shoe</b> will be the deepest point possible to intersect. This means that if an openhole section exists below the <b>casing</b> <b>shoe,</b> this cannot be utilized during the bottom kill operation. Surface Seismic While Drilling Johansen et al. (2013) suggested using repeated Surface Seismic While Drilling (SSWD) to measure the relative distance between the two wells in real time, as the relief well is being drilled. This is performed by acquiring seismic reference data before drilling is initiated, then the seismic survey is repeated continuously as the bit propagates down into the earth. If the reference seismic data is subtracted from the newly acquired seismic data, this will yield only the changes in the subsurface. Hence, the true wellpath can be found. This method has the potential of facilitating a direct intersection, regardless of the presence of steel in the blowing wellbore. Simulation Results Simulations were performed to evaluate the benefits of a deeper intersection point. The results showed that a <b>casing</b> <b>shoe</b> intersection would require an injection rate of 290 l/s to dynamically kill the blowing well with seawater. If the well were intersected at the bottom, the dynamic killing rate was reduced to 151 l/s, or a reduction of 48 %. The pump power requirements are dependent on the injection method, but the minimum pump power was 19759 and 4942 hp, for casing shoe- and bottomhole intersection, respectively. This is a total reduction of 75 %. The <b>casing</b> <b>shoe</b> pressure during killing was reduced by 21 %. When circulating from the bottom, calculations showed that the well could be killed using a high-capacity drilling rig utilizing the mud circulation system and the cement pumps. A <b>casing</b> <b>shoe</b> intersection required several additional pumps. Depending on deck capacity, pumping vessels or an additional rig would have to be mobilized, increasing the cost of the operation and mobilization time...|$|E

This paper can {{be divided}} into three parts, with the purpose of introducing and analyzing the characteristics of this new technology. First, the major equipment characteristic of this technology was introduced. Secondly, compared with conventional gas drilling, Angel’s model was used to analyze the wellbore flow characteristics.

Apart from this, it is also found that the kinetic energy at the <b>casing</b> <b>shoe</b> is always smaller than that {{at the top of the}} collar. The proposing of the drilling limit concept points out the basic difference between the two gas drilling technologies.

40|$|Elastic {{inversion}} methods {{may be able}} {{to detect}} buried gas hydrate deposits in the tophole section in certain deepwater settings (the tophole section of a deepwater well is typically defined as the upper 450 m of sediment). To date, there are few instances of using inversion methods to characterize the distribution of gas hydrates in deepwater settings so there is great value to industry and academia in applying these techniques to image the distribution of known or suspected buried gas hydrate deposits. Employing inversion methods to characterize gas hydrate deposits, if successful in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, would (from the geohazards perspective) be a significant advance for the planning of deepwater exploration and development wells.

40|$|Today {{the world}} is {{experiencing}} an ever increasing energy demand. Since petroleum resources are an important contributor to the energy demands of the modern world, exploration efforts are being pushed to new frontiers. Deep-water offshore exploration involves a number of challenges that has pushed for new technology development. Dual-gradient drilling systems like Subsea Mudlift Drilling (SMD) - and Low Riser Return System (LRRS) are leading contactors in this new area of drilling technology. LRRS has a subsea mud pump that enables having the riser only partially filled with mud, as the pump will transport mud from the riser to rig surface. Above the mud is air or an inert gas mixture. This {{makes it possible to}} drill with a higher mud-weight compared to conventional offshore operations, and also regulate BHP quickly by changing the riser fluid level. It is very important to evaluate the safety of this new system, especially with regards to well control. In determining the pressure buildup during an unscheduled influx of formation fluids (kick), and compare it with a conventional offshore drilling system, it is possible to determine how much influx LRRS can take compared to the conventional setup. Doing so will determine the operational safety and limitations of LRRS compared to conventional drilling operation. The major benefit of LRRS is the ability to have a much lower pre-kick casing pressure than a conventional system. Since the mud weight of LRRS will be higher in deep water operations, the pressure gradient is equally higher. When both systems have the same BHP, LRRS will have a much larger difference between <b>casing</b> <b>shoe</b> pressure and fracture pressure at the <b>casing</b> <b>shoe.</b> As a result LRRS can take much larger influxes (82, 9 % in 650 m water depth) compared to the conventional system when a kick is encountered at the same depth and with the same kick intensity. When a gas bubble is pressure relieved as it migrates up hole, a certain amount of mud must be bled form the well to induce a given pressure reduction within the gas. Since LRRS has a heavier mud-weight, the loss of hydrostatic will be higher. This leads to a steeper pressure buildup curve, which will reduce the benefits of LRRS in slim holes and when large influxes are taken. In the case of 650 m water depth LRRS has a benefit in slim-hole of 30, 6 %. The benefits of LRRS are magnified in deep waters, where the mud-weight difference is large. In a deep water case, LRRS has a kick-margin benefit of 170, 7 % over conventional. However, when the influx volume is increased from 10 m 3 to 15 m 3 LRRS’s kick margin benefit over conventional is 105, 3 %. Compared to the leading dual-gradient drilling system (SMD) LRRS has a 25, 6 % kick margin benefit, in 650 m water depth. This is because LRRS can operate with even higher mud-weight than the SMD system. In deeper waters the relative benefit of LRRS compared to SMD with regard to the conventional system, will be lower. </p...|$|E
30|$|The rising {{speed of}} gas kick is an {{important}} parameter in well control operation. The position of the gas kick dictates the pressure at the <b>casing</b> <b>shoe,</b> which is usually the weakest point in the openhole section, and the wellhead pressure, {{which is one of}} the key factors affecting the blowout preventer and choke folder. In this research, we derived a rigorous model to estimate the rising speed of gas kick. Starting from the force analysis and mass conservation, we developed equations to calculate the forces exerting on the gas kick. With the mass of the gas kick, the rising speed of the gas kick is calculated. The effect of wellbore temperature profile on the rising of the gas kick is taken into account in the derivation. Before the development of this model, the estimation of gas kick position is commonly based on experience. In many cases, the experience alone is not good enough for well control. The proposed model provides a new approach with solid theoretical base to characterize the rising of gas kick in the hole. It makes the procedure of the well control simple and makes drilling engineers feel more comfortable to control the well. The new model can be combined with engineers experience to predict the downhole situation, shut-in casing pressure, and mud rate as a functions of position of gas kick. Any deviation from the forecast indicates accidents or downhole problems. Therefore, the proposed model is a valuable tool to diagnose the problems in well control.|$|E
