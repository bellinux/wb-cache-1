25|$|Ranevskaya's {{failure to}} address {{problems}} facing her estate and family mean that she eventually loses almost everything and her fate {{can be seen}} as a criticism of those people who are unwilling to adapt to the new Russia. Her petulant refusal to accept the truth of her past, in both life and love, is her downfall throughout the play. She ultimately runs between her life in Paris and in Russia (she arrives from Paris at the start of the play and returns there afterwards). She is a woman who lives in an illusion of the past (often reliving memories about her son's death, etc.). The speeches by the student Trofimov, attacking intellectuals were later seen as early manifestations of Bolshevik ideas and his lines were often censored by the Tsarist officials. <b>Cherry</b> <b>trees</b> themselves are often seen as symbols of sadness or regret at the passing away of a certain situation or of the times in general.|$|E
