The album was described as being a rock and worship album, being aimed directly at a Christian audience.|$|E
5|$|Thiele and von Arnim {{were the}} first to refuel from the single tanker that had made it safely to Narvik and later moved to the Ballangenfjord, a {{southern}} arm of the Ofotfjord, closer to the entrance. Shortly before dawn on 10 April, the five destroyers of the British 2nd Destroyer Flotilla surprised the five German destroyers in Narvik harbor. They torpedoed two destroyers and badly damaged the other three while suffering only minor damage themselves. As they were beginning to withdraw they encountered the three destroyers of the 4th Flotilla which had been alerted in the Herjansfjord when the British began their attack. The Germans opened fire first, but the gunnery for both sides was not effective due to the mist and the smoke screen laid by the British as they retreated down the Ofotfjord. The German ships had to turn away to avoid a salvo of three torpedoes fired by one of the destroyers in Narvik, but Thiele and von Arnim had also been alerted and were <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> engage the British.|$|E

25|$|The battle {{started with}} an {{exchange}} of gunfire at long range, the federal gunboats {{setting up a line}} of battle across the river and firing their rear guns at the cottonclads <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> meet them. The USS Queen of the West, then quickly steamed forward between the slow moving ironclads and initiated the battle by ramming the CSS Colonel Lovell, almost cutting the vessel in two. Before breaking free from the Lowell she was rammed by the Sumter Due to the lack of organization on both sides the battle was soon reduced to a melee.

25|$|Mexico was {{the first}} time that Prost would {{publicly}} complain that his Honda V10 did not seem to work as well as Senna's, pointing out that early in the race he was clearly faster than Senna through the Peraltada curve heading onto the long front straight, but that even with a tow from Senna he was not able to make any ground on him. Then later in the race when Senna was <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> lap Prost (who had much fresher tyres), the Brazilian was easily able to catch and pass him on the straight despite being slower through the final turn (it was later revealed that Prost ran less wing than Senna which should have theoretically given him better straight line speed).|$|E
25|$|<b>Coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the 2011 World Championships in Daegu, Vlašić isn't the {{favourite}} at all. With 2,00 m, she's not {{leading the}} world rankings and Russia long time rival Anna Chicherova {{has all the}} expectations for the win, thanks to a Russian record of 2,07 m. Italy's Antonietta Di Martino is also in a good shape coming to the Worlds, having (as Vlašić) jumped 2,00 m outdoors but did better indoors with an Italian record of 2,04 m. Moreover, Vlašić was not sure {{to show up at}} the championships due ton an injury at her left leg. However, during the championships, she showed great form and managed to clear 2,03 m and earn silver medal, not being far to clear 2,05 and create history to become the first high jumper to win 3 consecutives world titles. Anna Chicherova beats the Croatian on countbacks, while Antonietta Di Martino has to settle for the bronze with 2,00 m.|$|E

25|$|In a June 2016 interview, Kiedis {{stated that}} he at first regretted writing Scar Tissue saying “I did regret the book for a while as there was some pain caused then, I started seeing the long term {{positive}} reverberating. People were reading it in hospitals, in prisons and schools and it was having a positive effect. I realised that {{the whole point of}} writing that book wasn’t for me, but to show that somebody can go all the way down and come all the way back and have a productive, successful happy interesting life. And so whatever shame, pain or difficulty or discomfort I went through, then it was worth it because I get so many people <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> me saying their kids had read it and got their act together because of it.” Kiedis has stated that due to the subject matter in his book, especially his reflections on his sexual relationships, that he hopes that his family hasn't read his book. “I have asked everyone in my family not to read the book.” Kiedis said.|$|E
25|$|The battle {{started with}} an {{exchange}} of gunfire at long range, the federal gunboats {{setting up a line}} of battle across the river and firing their rear guns at the cottonclads <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> meet them as they entered the battle stern first. Two of the four rams advanced beyond the line of the gunboats and rammed or otherwise disrupted the movements of their opponents; the other rams misinterpreted their orders and did not enter the battle at all. With the federal rams and gunboats not coordinating their movements and the Confederate vessels operating independently, the battle soon was reduced to a melee. It is agreed by all that the ram flagship, , initiated hostilities by slamming into CSS Colonel Lovell. She was then rammed in turn by {{one or more of the}} remaining cottonclads. Ellet was at this time wounded by a pistol shot in his knee, thereby becoming the only casualty on the Union side. (In the hospital, he contracted measles, the childhood disease that killed some 5,000 soldiers during the war. The combination of the disease and the debilitation caused by his wound was too great, and he died on June 21.) The remainder of the battle is obscured by more than the fog of war. Several eyewitness accounts are available; however, they are mutually contradictory to a greater degree than usual. All that is certain is that at the end of the battle, all but one of the cottonclads were either destroyed or captured, and one Yankee boat, Queen of the West, was disabled. The sole boat to escape, CSS General Earl Van Dorn, fled to the protection of the Yazoo River, just north of Vicksburg. Personnel losses among the Confederates cannot be estimated reliably.|$|E
