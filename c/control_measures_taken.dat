5000|$|Stormwater {{management}} BMPs are <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> <b>taken</b> {{to mitigate}} changes to both {{quantity and quality}} of urban runoff caused through changes to land use. Generally BMPs focus on water quality problems caused by increased impervious surfaces from land development. BMPs are designed to reduce stormwater volume, peak flows, and/or nonpoint source pollution through evapotranspiration, infiltration, detention, and filtration or biological and chemical actions. BMPs also can improve receiving-water quality by extending the duration of outflows in comparison to inflow duration (known as hydrograph extension), which dilutes the stormwater discharged into a larger volume of upstream flow.|$|E

However, few of the existing approaches to reviewing <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> <b>take</b> into account or effectively tackle these conditions. This paper introduces a three-level (i. e., individual hazards, hazard types, and generic hazards) hierarchical Bayesian model based on workers' responses to proximity warnings of safety hazards to address the problem. The proposed model distinguishes between two uses of proximity warnings (i. e., as the primary <b>control</b> <b>measure</b> and as the secondary measure), uses observational response rates as input, takes into account prior knowledge of workers' responses to similar hazards, and produces estimated response rates (ERRs). These ERRs are the primary indicator {{of the effectiveness of}} a given <b>control</b> <b>measure</b> {{as well as of the}} validity of a previously identified safety hazard. A 17 -day field experiment was conducted to test the proposed approach, preliminarily using a location-based proximity warning system to warn workers of safety hazards and record their responses to warnings. The experimental results demonstrated the potential of the proposed approach. The limitations of the present analysis and the directions for future research are also discussed.

40|$|Mathematical {{models have}} been used to {{understand}} the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and {{to assess the impact of}} intervention strategies. Traditional mathematical models usually assume a homogeneous mixing in the population, which is rarely the case in reality. Here, we construct a new transmission function by using as the probability density function a negative binomial distribution, and we develop a compartmental model using it to model the heterogeneity of contact rates in the population. We explore the transmission dynamics of the developed model using numerical simulations with different parameter settings, which characterize different levels of heterogeneity. The results show that when the reproductive number, [GRAPHICS], is larger than one, a low level of heterogeneity results in dynamics similar to those predicted by the homogeneous mixing model. As the level of heterogeneity increases, the dynamics become more different. As a test case, we calibrated the model with the case incidence data for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing in 2003, and the estimated parameters demonstrated the effectiveness of the <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> <b>taken</b> during that period...|$|E
