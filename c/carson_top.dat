50|$|At Newmarket in October, Little Wolf {{was moved}} up in {{distance}} for the Jockey Club Cup over two miles. Ridden by <b>Carson</b> he carried <b>top</b> {{weight in the}} Group Three race and started 9/4 favourite. He appeared to be struggling at one point but moved through {{to take the lead}} three furlong from the finish and drew away from the field to win by six lengths from Halsbury, with the Irish horse Ore three lengths away in third place. Little Wolf sustained a gash to his leg during the race but recovered for his final appearance of the season in the Prix Royal-Oak. Little Wolf started the 2/1 favourite for the Group One race over 3100m at Longchamp on 24 October but appeared unsuited by the very soft ground and finished sixth of the thirteen runners behind Denel.|$|R
