5000|$|The M5 has {{the largest}} M shutter speed dial. It is coaxial with the shutter button and {{overhangs}} the top plate, making for very comfortable and quick manipulation, adjustable without taking the camera from your eye. This ergonomic feature is often cited {{as one of the}} M5's paradigmatic advantages, and a non-coaxial variant was later reintroduced as of the M6 TTL (1998). The M5 is the only full-size M with shutter speeds visible in the finder. It allows reliable, linear intermediate speeds between full click stops from the 1/1000 through to the 1/2 second setting. The speed dial is additionally engraved with [...] "B" [...] (Bulb) speeds from 1 to 30 seconds. These settings are coupled with the light meter, but the exposure time must be manually implemented using a <b>cable</b> <b>release.</b> The camera's internal exposure timing mechanism disengages below the 1/2 second setting. The shutter release button is threaded for a standard <b>cable</b> <b>release.</b> The M5 is capable of making double exposures.|$|E
