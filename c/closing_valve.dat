50|$|Conversely, {{the closing}} of the valve does not {{immediately}} stop flow at the runner entrance, which continues completely unaffected until the signal that the valve closed reaches it. The <b>closing</b> <b>valve</b> causes a buildup of pressure that travels up the runner as a positive wave. The runner entrance continues to flow at full speed, forcing the pressure to rise until the signal reaches the entrance. This very considerable pressure rise can be seen on the graph below, it rises far above atmospheric pressure.|$|E
5000|$|Smaller-scale inflatables (such as pool toys) {{generally}} {{consist of}} one or more [...] "air chambers", which are hollow enclosures bound by a soft and flexible airtight material (such as vinyl), which a gas can enter into or leave from through valves (usually one on each air chamber). The design dependence upon an enclosed pocket of gas leads to a need for a very durable surface material and/or ease of repair of tears and holes on the material, since a puncture or tear will result in the escape of the gas inside (a leak) and the deflation of the inflatable, which depends on the gas's pressure to hold its form. Detectable leaks can be caused by holes (from punctures or tears) on the material, the separating of seams, the separating of valve parts, or an improperly shut or improperly <b>closing</b> <b>valve.</b> Even if an inflatable possesses no macroscopic leaks, the gas inside will usually diffuse out of the inflatable, albeit at a much slower rate, until equilibrium is reached with the pressure outside the inflatable.|$|E

40|$|Using an {{additional}} valve (i. e. clapper check valves) downstream the main <b>closing</b> <b>valve,</b> fast valve closing is possible without any cavitational hammer. Additionally a new passive safety system (ABS-Armatur) {{for the prevention}} of water hammer upstream the main <b>closing</b> <b>valve</b> is introduced. Upstream the closure valve, a brake line connects the transport liquid of the m ain pipe with a hydraulic brake system. In case of valve action (closing), the pressure upstream the valve increases rapidly causing a fast interruption of the closing process. With decreasing pressure the closing process may continue. By combination of both methods pressure up - as well as downstream the <b>closing</b> <b>valve</b> may be safely controlled...|$|E
40|$|Within {{this paper}} an {{overview}} about six recently performed experimental pressure surge scenarios is given. Two scenarios {{are discussed in}} more detail. Three models of different physical depth are used to calculate cavitation hammer (first and second model) and the maximum length of the vapor bubble downstream a <b>closing</b> <b>valve</b> (third model), respectively. For the calculation of cavitation hammer two models are used, the full concentrate vapor cavity model and a three phase model. Moreover an innovative pipework modification to prevent high cavitation hammer is presented. This method requires {{the knowledge of the}} maximum length of a vapor bubble downstream a <b>closing</b> <b>valve.</b> In case of a simple pipe geometry this can be achieved by solving the momentum equation for the downstream water column (third model). In combination with the Joukowsky equation one can give a quite good estimation of the first cavitational hammer pressure peak without a software code necessary...|$|E

40|$|The {{result of}} an {{analytical}} and experimental study in developing a control strategy for expansion devices in small commercial refrigeration systems has been presented. The objective {{of the study was}} to improve system efficiency by optimization of the control of the expansion device. For this product type, typically capillary tubes are applied as the expansion device and compressor cycling is used to control product temperature. It is shown that for products with short operating periods (i. e. more than 4 cycles per hour), large energy saving potential exists by improvement of the evaporator filling during the first minutes after compressor activation and avoiding refrigerant migration during the compressor off cycle. A validated control strategy, based on the use of an electronic expansion device with <b>closing</b> <b>valve</b> functionality, is presented and the impact on cooling system design is discussed. Experimental validations using a dedicated test set-up, showed a reduction in cooling system energy consumption of 12 and 20 % for respectively, a R- 744 and a R- 404 A based cooling system of a vending machine in comparison to the benchmark capillary based system. Analyses showed that approximately 50 - 70 % of this gain can be contributed to improving the cyclic average evaporator filling and that the remaining gain is resulting from avoiding refrigerant migration using <b>closing</b> <b>valve</b> functionality...|$|E

Stationary magnetic disk mounted just upstream of poppet, also containing magnet. Valve body nonmagnetic. Forward pressure or flow would push poppet away from stationary magnetic disk so fluid flows easily around poppet. Stop in valve body prevents poppet from being swept away. When flow stopped or started to reverse, magnetic attraction draws poppet back to disk. Poppet then engages floating O-ring, thereby <b>closing</b> <b>valve</b> and preventing reverse flow. Floating O-ring facilitates sealing at low loads...|$|E

40|$|Reliable {{assessment}} of mechanical heart valve function remains a difficult clinical problem. We {{have shown that}} 1) leaflets of bileaflet mechanical valves do not close simultaneously and 2) the dominant energy contained in closing sounds created by these valves is in the ultrasonic range (> 20 kHz). Taking advantage of these findings, we designed a real-time Macintoshbased system that permits a clinician to evaluate dynamic characteristics of these valves by listening to closing sounds played back at slow speeds. Valve sounds detected by a high-frequency accelerometer microphone are amplified and undergo a 12 -bit analog-to-digital conversion at 140 kHz. During data acquisition <b>closing</b> <b>valve</b> sounds are digitally detected for immediate playback through an audio output. The user can select the speed and length of sound playback. While the expanded closing sounds are plotted on the screen, the audio output gives the clinician a unique appreciation of <b>closing</b> <b>valve</b> dynamics. Sound output can be through either a dedicated digital-to-analog converter or the regular Macintosh sound interface, thus allowing previously recorded data to be presented on any standard Macintosh system. A recording obtained from a patient with a bileaflet mitral valve is shown below. Slowing playback speed reduces dominant frequencies of valve closure sounds into the audible range {{making it easy to}} recognize sounds from individual leaflet impacts as well as noises caused by leaflets scraping against valve structures. This system is directly applicable to sounds created by any type of mechanical heart valve. ConclusionsSlow speed playback of high-frequency sounds created by closing mechanical heart valves gives important insight into valve function. This technique, readily implemented with personal computers, provides a simple and inexpensive method to screen patients with mechanical heart valves...|$|E

40|$|In this research, {{a method}} {{previously}} applied to improve a digital simulation of the avian syrinx {{is adapted to}} the geometry of the clarinet reed. The clarinet model is studied with {{particular attention to the}} case when the reed beats again the lay of the mouthpiece, closing off air flow to the bore once each period. In place of the standard reed table which gives steady-state volume flow as a function of constant pressure difference across the reed, a more realistic dynamic volume flow model is proposed. The differential equation governing volume flow dynamics is seen to have a singularity at the point of reed closure, where both the volume flow and reed channel area become zero. The feathered clarinet reed refers to the method, first used in the syrinx, to smooth or feather the volume flow cutoff in a <b>closing</b> <b>valve.</b> The feathered valve eliminates the singularity and reduces artifacts in the simulated clarinet output. 1...|$|E

40|$|Water hammer on {{transient}} flow of {{hydrogen-natural gas mixture}} in a horizontal pipeline is analysed to determine the relationship between pressure waves and different modes of closing and opening of valves. Four types of laws applicable to <b>closing</b> <b>valve,</b> namely, instantaneous, linear, concave, and convex laws, are considered. These closure laws describe the speed variation of the hydrogen-natural gas mixture as the valve is closing. The numerical solution is obtained using the reduced order modelling technique. The results show that changes in the pressure wave profile and amplitude depend {{on the type of}} closing laws, valve closure times, and the number of polygonal segments in the closing function. The pressure wave profile varies from square to triangular and trapezoidal shape {{depending on the type of}} closing laws, while the amplitude of pressure waves reduces as the closing time is reduced and the numbers of polygonal segments are increased. The instantaneous and convex closing laws give rise to minimum and maximum pressure, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Fast acting valves {{are often}} applied for quick safety {{shut-down}} of pipelines for liquids and {{gases in the}} chemical and petrochemical industry {{as well as in}} power plants and state water supplies. The fast deceleration of the liquid leads to water hammer upstream the valve and to cavitational hammer downstream the fast <b>closing</b> <b>valve.</b> The valve characteristics given by manufacturers are usually measured at steady state flow conditions of the liquid. In comparison, the dynamic characteristics depend on the initial liquid velocity, valve closing velocity, the absolute pipe pressure and the pipe geometry. Fraunhofer UMSICHT conducts various test series examining valve dynamic characteristics in order of the dynamic analysis of pressure surges in fast closing processes. Therefore a test rig is used which consists of two pipelines of DN 50 and DN 100 with an approximate length of 230 m each. In this paper the results of performed pressure surge experiments with fast closing and opening valves will be compared to calculations of commercial software programs such as MONA, FLOWMASTER 2. Thus the calculation software for water supply, power plants, oil and gas and chemical industry can be permanently improved...|$|E
40|$|The {{governor}} actuators in some heat-engine {{plants have}} nonlinear valves. This nonlinearity of valves {{may lead to}} the inaccuracy of the opening and closing time constants calculated based on the whole segment fully open and fully close experimental test curves of the valve. An improved mathematical model of the turbine governor actuator is proposed to reflect the nonlinearity of the valve, in which the main and auxiliary piecewise opening and closing time constants instead of the fixed oil motive opening and closing time constants are adopted to describe the characteristics of the actuator. The main opening and closing time constants are obtained from the linear segments of the whole fully open and close curves. The parameters of proportional integral derivative (PID) controller are identified based on the small disturbance experimental tests of the valve. Then the auxiliary opening and closing time constants and the piecewise opening and <b>closing</b> <b>valve</b> points are determined by the fully open/close experimental tests. Several testing functions are selected to compare genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm (GA-PSO) with other basic intelligence algorithms. The effectiveness of the piecewise linear model and its parameters are validated by practical power plant case studies...|$|E

40|$|The LHC vacuum sector valves {{are located}} in the {{straight}} sections of the LHC ring, and designed to sectorize the LHC vacuum. The valves are interlocked and should trigger a beam dump request if they close on a circulating beam. This report studies the impact on the machine if this request is not made and the valve scrapes the LHC beam halo. Cascade calculations are made using a model of IR 7, with several different valve locations, to calculate the downstream energy deposition in superconducting magnet coils and the corresponding signal in beam loss monitors at the quench level. The calculations are done at 7, 5, and 3. 5 TeV. It is found that when a downstream magnet reaches the quench level, the neighbouring BLMs see a signal well above the detection threshold. Furthermore, the BLM signal is consistent with the BLM applied threshold settings and a signal is seen in the time domain before the quench level is reached. Therefore the report concludes that the BLMs can see the <b>closing</b> <b>valve</b> and trigger a beam dump before the quench (or damage) level is reached...|$|E
40|$|A {{sensor system}} {{for the study of}} oil–water flow in pipes is proposed. The purpose is to {{estimate}} the area fraction occupied by each fluid in a given section of the pipe, taking advantage of the difference in dielectric permittivity between the fluids. The estimation is done by capacitance measurements between electrodes flush-mounted on the external surface of a nonconductive section of the pipe.

To this purpose it is proposed a novel sensor configuration that employs guard electrodes, coupled to a tailored electronic interface to drive the guard electrodes and amplify the measurement signal at 2 MHz. The sensor system has been designed, manufactured and tested in an experimental plant where flows of oil–tap water have been generated.

At the experimental area of Sparacia, Sicily, the runoff produced by an erosive event is collected within storage tanks with a capacity of about 1 m 3. In this paper, the use of a new sampler is proposed to measure easily the weight of solid material eroded from an experimental plot and collected into a storage tank. The sampler is a cylinder having a <b>closing</b> <b>valve</b> at the bottom. Two different series of runs were carried out both to test the reliability of the sampler and to establish a sampling procedure, respectively. An analysis of various sampling configurations usable in the field differentiated by the number and location of sampling verticals in the tank cross-section was finally carried out. The results of the present investigation are that the concentration measurement by the sampler was more accurate than that obtained by other methods involving a collection tank, agitation and sampling of the suspension. This sampler is cheap and usable in combination with a quick field sampling procedure which is particularly advisable when the number of plots equipped at an experimental area is large. The sampler was tested using a clay soil contained within cylinders and a cubic tank, but it appeared also to be usable with coarser sediment than clay and in combination with tanks having a different shape...|$|E
