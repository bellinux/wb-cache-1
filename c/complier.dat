5000|$|Fitzwilliam {{was educated}} at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he entered as a {{servitor}} in 1651, and {{was elected to}} a demyship in the same year. At the Restoration, according to Anthony à Wood, ‘he turned about and became a great <b>complier</b> to the restored liturgy.’ But Fitzwilliam himself appeals to ‘the zeal I had for the present government even while it was merely to be enjoyed in hopes, and we could only wish it might be restored’ (sermon preached in 1683). In 1661 he was elected fellow of Magdalen, and held his fellowship until 1670. He was made librarian of the college in 1662, being {{at the same time}} university lecturer on music. His first patron was Dr. George Morley, afterwards bishop of Winchester, who recommended him to the lord treasurer, Thomas Wriothesley, the virtuous earl of Southampton, in 1664, in whose family he resided as chaplain, and instructed Lady Rachel Wriothesley and her sisters. On the death of the Earl of Southampton Bishop Morley ‘took him into his own household,’ and on ‘his dismission from his service with a fair reward’ recommended him in 1666 as chaplain to the Duke of York, afterwards James II, to whose daughter, the Princess Anne, he became tutor. In 1669 he was appointed by Bishop Morley to the living of Brightstone in the Isle of Wight, on the resignation of Dr. Thomas Ken, who was collated to the living of Woodhay. He was afterwards presented by his friend, Bishop Turner of Ely, to the living of Cottenham, near Cambridge, and promoted by the crown to a canonry at Windsor in 1688. He was a friend both of Thomas Ken and of his brother-in-law, Izaak Walton, who sent him presentation copies of all his works. He was also on terms of intimacy with John Kettlewell. He attended, with Ken, Bishop Morley's deathbed in 1684. At the Revolution he resigned his preferments, because his conscience forbad him to take the oaths of allegiance to the new dynasty.|$|E

Few of the existing routing protocols contain the mechanism to prevent route disruption caused by link breakages between oppositely moving nodes in a partitioned network. In our protocol, a node does not forward a RREQ (Route Request) received from a node moving in opposite direction unless a special request is made by that node in RREQ packet. The node which accepts this special request and forwards the RREQ, despite moving opposite to the previous node is called <b>complier</b> node. The <b>complier</b> node adds its information in the RREQ packet. On receiving RREQ, the destination knows that <b>complier</b> node is moving towards some successive nodes in the routing path. Through the RREP (Route Reply), it informs those nodes about the <b>complier</b> node. Each of these successive nodes waits for the approaching <b>complier</b> node. When it comes near, each establishes connection with the <b>complier</b> node on its turn. Thus the route from source to destination is maintained.

40|$|In {{randomized}} controlled trials, the intention-to-treat estimator provides an unbiased {{estimate of the}} causal effect of treatment assignment on the outcome. However, patients often want to knowwhat the effect would be {{if they were to}} take the treatment as prescribed (the patient-oriented effect), and several researchers have suggested that the more relevant causal effect for this question is the <b>complier</b> average causal effect (CACE), also referred to as the local average treatment effect. Sophisticated approaches to estimating the CACE include Bayesian and frequentist methods for principal stratification, inverse-probability-of-treatment–weighted estimators, and instrumental-variable (IV) analysis. All of these approaches exploit information about adherence to assigned treatment to improve upon the intention-to-treat estimator, but they are rarely used in practice, probably because of their complexity. The IV principal stratification estimator is simple to implement but has had limited use in practice, possibly due to lack of familiarity. Here, we show that the IV principal stratification estimator is a modified per-protocol estimator that should be obtainable from any {{randomized controlled}} trial, and we provide a closed form for its robust variance (and its uncertainty). Finally, we illustrate sensitivity analyses we conducted to assess inference in light of potential viola-tions of the exclusion restriction assumption. as-treated analysis; <b>complier</b> average causal effect; instrumental variables; per-protocol analysis; randomized trials Abbreviations: AT, always takers; BC, baseline compliers; CACE, <b>complier</b> average causal effect; ITT, intention to treat; IV...|$|E

40|$|Structural mean models (SMMs) {{are used}} to {{estimate}} causal effects among those selecting treatment in randomised controlled trials affected by non-ignorable non-compliance. These causal effects can be identified by assuming {{that there is no}} effect modification, namely, that the causal effect is equal for the treated subgroups randomised to treatment and to control. By analysing simple structural models for binary outcomes, we argue that the no effect modification assumption does not hold in general, and so SMMs do not estimate causal effects for the treated. An exception is for designs in which those randomised to control can be completely excluded from receiving the treatment. However, when there is non-compliance in the control arm, local (or <b>complier)</b> causal effects can be identified provided that the further assumption of monotonic selection into treatment holds.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Cost {{data are}} being {{collected}} {{more frequently in}} randomized clinical trials {{in order to assess}} the cost-effectiveness of experimental treatments. As such, the goal of this dissertation is to study three separate topics which advance the analysis of medical cost data. First, time between recurrent medical events may be correlated with the cost incurred at each event. As a result, it may be of interest to describe the relationship between recurrent events and recurrent medical costs by estimating a joint distribution. In this paper, we therefore formulate a nonparametric estimator for the joint distribution of recurrent events and recurrent medical costs in right-censored data. We also derive the asymptotic variance of our estimator, and present simulation studies to demonstrate the performance of our point and variance estimators. Our estimator is shown to perform well for a range of levels of correlation, demonstrating that our estimators can be employed in a variety of situations when the correlation structure may be unknown in advance. We apply our methods to hospitalization events and their corresponding costs in the second Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial (MADIT-II), which was a randomized clinical trial studying the effect of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators in preventing ventricular arrhythmia. Next, as the costs of medical care increase, more studies are evaluating cost in addition to effectiveness of treatments. Cost-effectiveness in randomized clinical trials has typically been evaluated only at the end of follow-up. However, cost-effectiveness may change over time. We therefore propose a nonparametric estimator to assess the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio over time. We also derive the asymptotic variance of our estimator and present implementation of simultaneous confidence bands. Simulation studies demonstrate the performance of our proposed methods. We also illustrate our methods using data from a randomized clinical trial, the second Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial (MADIT-II). This trial studied the effects of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators on patients at high risk for cardiac arrhythmia. Results show that our estimator performs well in large samples, indicating promising future directions in the field of cost-effectiveness. Finally, in randomized clinical trials that study cost as well as effectiveness, a common complication is often noncompliance to assigned treatment. In situations where compliance in the trial may differ from compliance rates in the population, it may be of interest to study <b>complier</b> average cost-effectiveness. In this paper, we relate the standard intention-to-treat parameters to the <b>complier</b> average causal effects of two well-known measures of cost-effectiveness, the incremental net benefit (INB) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). In particular, we show that the intention-to-treat effects are proportional to the <b>complier</b> average effect {{in the case of the}} INB, but that the intention-to-treat effect can be interpreted as the <b>complier</b> average effect for the ICER. We outline the assumptions required for these relationships to hold and we also present simulation studies confirming these properties. This work provides some incentive for employing the ICER over the INB when researchers are interested in <b>complier</b> average cost-effectiveness...|$|E
