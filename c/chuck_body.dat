40|$|We {{report on}} {{theoretical}} and experimental investigations into electrostatic chuck designs {{for use in}} future e-beam lithography on 450 mm Silicon wafers. Ultra-low thermal expansion glass (ULE) and Si infiltrated Silicon Carbide (SiSiC) designs were evaluated by finite element modeling, subject to a mass budget of 8 kg. In addition to massive chucks, light-weight designs were created by applying bore holes through the <b>chuck</b> <b>body</b> below its surface. Considerable chuck bending under gravity is observed with classical kinematic 3 -point mounts. Out-of-plane distortions of about 1250 (650) nm and 400 (200) nm for the massive and light-weight designs of ULE (SiSiC), respectively, were calculated. The corresponding surface in-plane distortions for a chucked Si wafer of standard thickness 925 ?m amount to about 3 (1. 6) nm for the massive and 1 (0. 5) nm for light-weight designs of ULE (SiSiC), respectively. By using the standard 6 th order polynomial correction upon e-beam writing, these values {{can be reduced to}} ? 0. 7 nm for the massive designs with both materials. Various pin-pattern configurations for an ideally flat chuck surface were adopted to determine resulting wafer bending under the influence of electrostatic forces. At a typical electrostatic pressure of about 18 kPa, a square pin pattern of pin-pitch 3. 5 mm and pin-diameter 0. 5 mm results in wafer in-plane distortions < 0. 5 nm, which is considered tolerable for obtaining the desired total overlay accuracy of < 4 nm. The pin structure manufacturing process for a corresponding ULE chuck surface was experimentally tested and verified. A nearly elliptic ULE plate, slightly larger than the wafer, was structured with a Chromium hard-mask and subjected to low pressure reactive ion etching to generate the pin-pattern. A homogeneity of about 7 % was obtained for the etching process, which is fully sufficient with respect to resulting variations in electrostatic attraction...|$|E
50|$|Without Angela, Roy's myriad phobias resurface, {{and during}} another panic attack, he {{ultimately}} learns that the medication {{given to him}} by Klein is a placebo. Roy proclaims that he needs Angela in his life but {{that he would have to}} change his lifestyle, much to Frank's disappointment. Roy and Angela return from dinner one night to find Chuck waiting for them with a gun, alongside a badly beaten Frank. Angela shoots Chuck and Roy sends her off with Frank into hiding until the matter can be sorted out. As Roy prepares to take care of <b>Chuck's</b> <b>body,</b> <b>Chuck</b> suddenly springs to life and knocks Roy unconscious.|$|R

He then stopped <b>Chuck</b> Mady with <b>body</b> shots in the first round for the ISKA Amateur Canadian Super Lightweight (-62.3 kg/137.2 lb) Oriental title on August 15, 2008.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the most}} celebrated songs on Desire is the {{symbolic}} travelogue [...] "Isis". According to music critic Tim Riley, [...] "Isis" [...] {{tells the story of a}} young groom who marries his bride before he learns the value of loyalty. Riley wrote that the story told of a man who learns about the love of a woman through the deception of another man and a [...] "quest for riches that resigned itself to the quest for human contact". Also, the protagonist mistakenly believes that his quest is for treasure when an ulterior purpose is at play. When he approaches the tomb, he finds it empty and without any reward. Unbeknownst to him, he was playing a part in a higher story line: the tomb eagerly awaited for the arrival of his companion who dies immediately. When he <b>chucks</b> the <b>body</b> into the empty space, he realizes what a folly this whole adventure has been, and decides to return to the arms of his knowing wife.|$|R

Bentley and the Intersect candidates surrender their weapons to Casey, as Chuck has realized the murderer {{must be one}} of them. To determine who killed Brody, Chuck plans to review security tapes and interrogate everyone. However, Damien believes that he is being suspected because of his appearance and angrily leaves. As he opens the door to exit Castle, however, an explosive is triggered. Though he manages to shield himself with the door, Damien is injured, ruling him out as a murder suspect.|$|R

Bryce and Sarah arrive and engage the Fulcrum team in hand-to-hand combat while Casey attempts a breakout with Chuck but is knocked out by Tommy, who takes Chuck captive. Bryce asks Chuck {{a question in}} Klingon, and after he responds, Bryce shoots Chuck. Casey then arrives and knocks out Tommy. Sarah discovers <b>Chuck</b> is wearing <b>body</b> armor and is alive. Bryce is assigned to go after Fulcrum and offers Sarah {{a chance to go}} with him. The episode ends with both Bryce and Chuck calling her, and Sarah unsure of which call to answer.|$|R
5000|$|Later that night, a {{wheezing}} [...] "creature" [...] {{breaks into}} Alameda's New Mexico State Blood Bank, brutally murdering {{one of the}} blood bank's nurses; the thing then proceeds to drink vast quantities of blood. The next day, the headline of the Santa Fe Daily News reads [...] "Terror Roams State" [...] and tells of brutal and inhuman slaughtering of cattle on a farm right next to where the Y-13 crashed. Both the dead cattle and the blood bank nurse show similar jagged wounds. When Chuck and Chief Wilson examine the nurse's <b>body,</b> <b>Chuck</b> notices shiny specks around the wound, {{as well as on}} the blood bank door. They see the same specks on the necks of the dead cattle. Lying under one of them they find a piece of what looks like [...] "a high-altitude oxygen lead" [...] that is used in the Y-13.|$|R
50|$|The next day, at {{an autopsy}} clinic, <b>Chuck</b> {{analyzes}} Dutch's <b>body</b> and Chief Hutchins tells Chuck {{that he would}} like for him to meet with a serial killer expert named Ken O'Hara. Ken {{was one of the best}} in Chief Hutchins' unit until he was forced into retirement due to a near fatal experience with his last job. Ken, who is separated from his wife, is spending the day with his daughter at the beach. As they are about to leave, Ken accidentally bumps into a big fat guy, causing him to spill his beer on his shirt. Ken apologizes and offers to pay for his shirt and beer. The big guy felt offended and wants to start a fight with Ken. Ken initially refuses to fight, but when the big guy does harm to Ken's daughter by pushing her out of the way despite her pleads for him to not harm Ken, Ken becomes enraged and fights the big guy and his two goons. He ends up knocking all three of them down.|$|R
