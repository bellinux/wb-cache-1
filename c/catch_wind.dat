25|$|Depending on location, various safe-haven {{areas have}} been prepared. The goal has been to avoid outer walls which might {{collapse}} when a roof section becomes airborne and the walls below lose their upper support: many interior rooms resist collapse longer, due to smaller walls interconnected to each other, while outer walls deflect {{the force of the}} winds. Because mobile homes typically lack foundation anchors and present a large surface-area sail (to <b>catch</b> <b>wind),</b> the advice has been to seek a safe haven elsewhere, such as in a stronger nearby building. When a mobile home begins to roll, people have been injured by hitting objects inside, or being crushed when a trailer suddenly hits the ground and begins to collapse around them.|$|E
