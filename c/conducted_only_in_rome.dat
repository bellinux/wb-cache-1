5000|$|Locatelli was patronized by kings, queens, princes, {{cardinals}} and the wealthy, not <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>Rome,</b> {{but also}} throughout Europe. One family- the Colonna- owned 81 of his paintings. At {{a time when}} it was becoming fashionable to make the Grand Tour, his paintings spread widely. Demand caused him to duplicate dozens of nearly identical ones. This may seem odd to us today, but at a time before photography, no one would have been aware of these “copies.” This was a very common practice by successful artists.|$|R
50|$|Pilae stacks are {{stacks of}} pilae tiles, square or round tiles, {{that were used}} in Roman times as an element of the {{underfloor}} heating system, common in Roman bathhouses, called the hypocaust. The concept of the Pilae stacks is that the floor is constructed at an elevated position, allowing air to freely circulate underneath and up, through the hollow bricks, into the structure walls. Examples of such baths are found not <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>Rome,</b> but also <b>in</b> Roman Britain and distant parts of the Roman Empire such as the baths at Chellah, in modern-day Morocco.|$|R

[...] The Jubilee officially ended on November 20, 2016 with the closing of the Holy Door of Saint Peter's Basilica which was open since the Holy Year began the previous December.|$|R
25|$|In 2014 a {{trend was}} noticed by the Orthodox Church: Following the {{translation}} of the Bible into the native language, the number of natives who practiced Christianity rapidly increased. Previously {{the growth of the}} Orthodox Church among native Yakuts was limited by the fact that church services were <b>conducted</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> Russian.|$|R

30|$|It {{should be}} noted that our {{hospital}} based study was <b>conducted</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> four hospitals, therefore it might not necessary capture all strains circulating in Indonesia, or the overall incidence among children who were not hospitalized for diarrhea. Despite the limitations of this study, our findings support one of the key steps for policy making in deciding the importance of rotavirus vaccine implementation.|$|R
50|$|AIPMT is {{criticized for}} being <b>conducted</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> English and Hindi, {{making it harder for}} {{students}} where vernacular languages such as Tamil, Telugu, Marathi or Gujarati are more prominent. As an example, in September 2011, the Gujarat High Court acted on Public Interest Litigation by the Gujarati Sahitya Parishad for conducting the exams in Gujarati. A second petition was made in October 2011.|$|R
50|$|While {{incorporating}} many of Boyd's recommendations, the act specifically removed {{any legal}} status for the arbitration of custodial and marital disputes by religious tribunals. The act mandated that all family law arbitrations <b>in</b> Ontario be <b>conducted</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> accordance with Canadian law. Some critics {{argued that this}} was a missed opportunity to incorporate aspects of Islamic law into the Canadian judicial system.|$|R

50|$|Antoninus was {{regarded}} as a skilled administrator and as a builder. In spite of an extensive building directive - the free access of the people of Rome to drinking water was expanded with the construction of aqueducts, not <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>Rome</b> but throughout the Empire, as well as bridges and roads - the emperor still managed to leave behind a sizable public treasury of around two and a half million sesterces (Rome would not witness another Emperor leaving his successor with a surplus for a long time.) But this treasury was depleted almost immediately after Antoninus's reign due to the plague brought back by soldiers after the Parthian victory).|$|R

Appointed by Pope Benedict XVI in 2007, he was {{replaced}} by Barbara Jatta, formerly the Vice Director, on 1 January 2017. Throughout his career Paolucci has worked not <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>Rome</b> but also <b>in</b> Florence, Venice, Verona, Mantua and other Italian cities, and has also received appointments to national offices related to art and culture. He has written numerous books and articles on Art History and made television appearances {{on a variety of}} programs to explain and promote art. He is the recipient of numerous awards for his work.|$|R
25|$|If {{religious}} {{exercises are}} held to be an impermissible activity in schools, religion is placed in an artificial and state-created disadvantage.... And a refusal to permit religious exercises thus is seen, not as the realization of state neutrality, but rather as {{the establishment of a}} religion of secularism, or at least, as governmental support of the beliefs of those who think that religious exercises should be <b>conducted</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> private.|$|R
5000|$|After {{independence}} Tajik {{was declared}} the sole state language and until 2009, Russian was designated the [...] "language for interethnic communication". The 2009 law stated that all official papers and {{education in the}} country should be <b>conducted</b> <b>only</b> <b>in</b> the Tajik language. However, the law also stated that all minority {{ethnic groups in the}} country have the right to choose in which language they want their children to be educated.|$|R

He died there on 6 October 1101.|$|R
2500|$|Multi-story {{apartment}} blocks called insulae catered {{to a range}} of residential needs. The cheapest rooms were at the top owing to the inability to escape {{in the event of a}} fire and the lack of piped water. Windows were mostly small, facing the street, with iron security bars. Insulae were often dangerous, unhealthy, and prone to fires because of overcrowding and haphazard cooking arrangements. There are examples in the Roman port town of Ostia, that date back to the reign of Trajan, but they seem to have been found <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>Rome</b> and a few other places. [...] Elsewhere writers report them as something remarkable, but Livy and Vituvius refer to them <b>in</b> <b>Rome.</b> [...] External walls were in [...] "Opus Reticulatum" [...] and interiors in [...] "Opus Incertum", which would then be plastered and sometimes painted.|$|R

50|$|Very {{little is}} known about his life, except for a few years in the 1420s to around 1430. It is presumed that he was from Flanders or {{adjacent}} areas. In the early 1420s he was probably {{in the service of the}} Malatesta family in either Rimini or Pesaro, since Dufay mentioned him in the text of a rondeau which was written between 1420 and 1424. Lantins was in Venice <b>in</b> 1428 and <b>Rome</b> <b>in</b> 1431, in the latter city as a singer in the papal chapel choir, along with Dufay. He was <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>Rome</b> six months; after that he disappears from history. Rome was entering a period of turmoil related to the Conciliar movement after the death, in February 1431, of Pope Martin V; many musicians left at that time or shortly after, and Lantins may have been one of them.|$|R
