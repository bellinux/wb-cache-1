40|$|In 2011 - 12, {{greenhouse}} gas emissions from the Australian residential sector were 101. 6 Mt {{and are expected to}} grow by 38 % by 2050. In order to reduce these emissions, much emphasis has been placed on increasing the energy efficiency of buildings and appliances. Occupant behaviour, however, is probably the single most significant factor which determines energy use and emissions. This paper describes research undertaken to rank the most <b>common</b> <b>occupant</b> behaviours, based upon their impact on {{greenhouse gas}} emissions associated with residential energy use, in an architect-designed house in Australia. The occupant behaviours investigated were changing: the heating and cooling temperature set points, window openings, external blind use and lighting use. Simulations were carried out using Primero and EnergyPlus software. Based on the simulation results of {{greenhouse gas emissions}}, the following ranking of overall influence (from most influential to the least) has been determined: external blind use {{was one of the most}} effective measures to reduce emissions. Cooling set point temperature was similarly important with the magnitude of impact depending on the set point e. g. a 2 °C increase had an impact comparable to the use of external blinds. The impact of the heating set point temperature was also dependent on the set point and overall slightly lower compared to the cooling set point temperature. Lighting use was the least influential parameter in the context of this study...|$|E
40|$|The idea of {{building}} underground is fascinating. From a designer’s perspective {{the creation of}} architectural spaces beneath the earth’s surface is a great accomplishment. Without building facades and a predetermined exterior shell {{it seems to be}} the ultimate interior and engineering challenge. Despite the enigma hereof, many people are startled by this concept as underground spaces are commonly associated with uncertainty; depicted by dark and confined passages. Many metro stations, especially older, more traditional ones, are detached from their external context. It is this disconnection that generates confusion and results in fear. Subterranean spaces have a unique atmosphere and the experience of being underground is quite different to that of being in a building or structure above ground level. When one enters a subterranean space you are confronted with a change in light quality and intensity. Artificial light, though used as the primary illumination source in most building structures, visibly play a more significant role due to the deficiency of natural light. The prominence of artificial light simultaneously enhances an awareness of the shadows and contrasts it produces. It is this “play” of light and dark that creates a mood and atmosphere different to that of other spaces. Furthermore, one becomes dependent on the provision of information, which can manifest in various forms such as signage, to orientate and direct oneself. Textures and finishes act as narrative tools that direct users safely to their destination. The scale and size of the space and the elements placed within it, is also experienced more intensely by users because of the contained nature of the space. Scale is therefore fundamental as the spaces can easily become uncomfortable and cramped. Though the subterranean experience is different, it does not imply that it is superior. It simply means that those differences should be acknowledged, which necessitates that underground spaces require a unique approach in their design in order to allow them to be appreciated and functionally utilised. The underground metro has become the most <b>common</b> <b>occupant</b> of subterranean space across the world. Thus it’s also the most obvious choice for an investigation and a design with a subterranean nature. In the South African context the Gautrain Rapid Rail Link presents the perfect opportunity to introduce the novel concept of travelling underground. This dissertation will investigate the functioning and progression of the metro with the intention of creating a design methodology aimed at initiating an underground culture fit for the contemporary South African society. It aspires to produce a station that would enhance the commuting experience, firstly by presenting a pleasant, safe and legible station and secondly, by offering retail and catering options to add.

5000|$|The {{most common}} {{understanding}} in the United Kingdom also {{stems from the}} belief that the most <b>common</b> <b>occupants</b> of the vans were Irish, though they were not driving, they were the arrested passengers. This comes from several perspectives: a) prejudice by English people that the Irish immigrants were largely common criminals, b) from the legendary stories of their fighting spirit and the fact that when arrested they were less likely to [...] "go quietly" [...] than other nationalities, requiring the use of the van rather than a carriage, and c) that the Irish liked to drink so much that drunken brawling would often ensue and thus the police van would be called to take them away into custody.|$|R
50|$|In {{naturally}} ventilated buildings, occupants take numerous {{actions to}} keep themselves comfortable when the indoor conditions drift towards discomfort. Operating windows and fans, adjusting blinds/shades, changing clothing, and consuming food and drinks {{are some of}} the common adaptive strategies. Among these, adjusting windows is the most <b>common.</b> Those <b>occupants</b> who take these sorts of actions tend to feel cooler at warmer temperatures than those who do not.|$|R

At that stage, Eversen consisted of 22 manorial farms, a community Hirtenhaus and the three manorial estates of the von Harling family. In addition there were the houses of the small farmers and hirelings. Because they only had small holdings of land and no grazing rights on the <b>commons,</b> their <b>occupants</b> earned their living by working on the estates or as salt drivers for the Sülze Saltworks.|$|R

Olympian herself, supremely, divinely Olympian, she had arrived, could only have arrived, for the one person present of really equal race, our young man's late converser, whose {{flattering}} demonstration might now stand {{for one of the}} odd extravagant forms taken by nervous impatience. This charming, this dazzling woman had been one member of the couple disturbed, to his intimate conviction, the autumn previous, on his being pushed by the officials, at the last moment, into a compartment of the train that was to take him from Cremona to Mantua--where, failing a stop, he had had to keep his place. The other member, by whose felt but unseized identity he had been haunted, was the unconsciously insolent form of guaranteed happiness he had just been engaged with. The sense of the admirable intimacy that, having taken its precautions, had not reckoned with his irruption--this image had remained with him; {{to say nothing of the}} interest of aspect of the associated figures, so stamped somehow with rarity, so beautifully distinct from the <b>common</b> <b>occupants</b> of padded corners, and yet on the subject of whom, for the romantic structure he was immediately to raise, he had not had a scrap of evidence.|$|R
40|$|Stand {{development}} {{patterns were}} examined in an Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) forest in Rocky Mountain National Park in northern Colorado. Two old-growth stands (with fine-scale windthrows dominating dynamics) and a 260 -yr-old post-fire stand were sampled for tree ages, sizes, growth, and replacement patterns in windthrow gaps. Visual assessment of frequency of growth releases in increment cores, and dendrochronology, were used. The post-fire stand was initially colonized by spruce and pine but fir has become increasingly abundant in the past 100 yr; canopy dominance is shifting from pine towards spruce and fir. In old growth stands, fir is the more <b>common</b> gap <b>occupant</b> but has a greater rate of treefall and spruce has greater longevity implying that both will continue to codominate the stand. It is concluded that there are substantial differences in response to fire, but disturbance by wind does not differentially favour spruce or fir...|$|R
5000|$|A {{household}} {{is officially}} defined as follows: A household includes all the persons who occupy a housing unit. A housing unit is a house, an apartment, a mobile home, {{a group of}} rooms, or a single room that is occupied (or if vacant, is intended for occupancy) as separate living quarters. Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live and eat separately from any other persons in the building and which have direct access from {{the outside of the}} building or through a <b>common</b> hall. The <b>occupants</b> may be a single family, one person living alone, two or more families living together, or any other group of related or unrelated persons who share living arrangements.

50|$|In {{the event}} {{emergency}} exits are required, the crash bar works efficiently {{to allow people}} to pass through security doors without a reduction in speed. A crash bar's fast-acting mechanism reduces the risk that a rushing crowd might suddenly become a logjam at the exits. Such a human stampede situation, which has many historical precedents, can cause falls, crushing, and other injury because the rear of a crowd has no idea that the people at the front of a crowd have come across a door.Crash bars are typically found on doors which are required emergency exits serving a particular type or quantity of <b>occupants.</b> <b>Common</b> locations include doors which provide egress from assembly areas, doors which serve many occupants, or doors serving hazardous areas. For buildings subject to the International Building Code, or a locally adopted variation, they are required for certain healthcare, education, or assembly spaces, generally related to the number of occupants exiting through a given door.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of wood, cigarette and marijuana smoke on the reproductive health of tandoor occupants. A total of 100 male individuals were selected (50 control and 50 tandoor occupants). A standard questionnaire was designed regarding their age, economic status, marital status, fuel type, exposure time (per day), use of mask, addiction and reproductive health. Morning blood samples of 5 mL of the size were taken from all participants. Serums were obtained and analyzed for total serum testosterone concentration. Bio-check (USA) kit was used according to the manufacturer protocol and procedures for testosterone analysis. In control group the mean ± SEM of total serum testosterone was 671. 9 ± 20. 02 ng/dl where as in tandoor occupants it was 542. 7 ± 16. 40 ng/dl. There was a significant reduction (P < 0. 0001) in total serum testosterone concentration in tandoor occupants as compared to control group. Reproductive health problems like, low libido, erection problems, infertility, decreased frequency for shaving and absent morning and nocturnal erection were <b>common</b> in tandoor <b>occupants</b> as compared to control group...|$|R
5000|$|Celbridge Abbey (.) was the {{childhood}} (1688-1707) and later adult (1714-23) home of Bartholomew Van Homrigh's daughter Esther (1688-1723), the ill-starred lover of Dean Swift. The poem in which Swift fictionalised her as [...] "Vanessa" [...] "Cadenus and Vanessa" [...] (1713) was written {{seven years before}} he visited her in Celbridge in 1720. A rock bower associated with the lovers is a 19th-century recreation. The current Celbridge Abbey was constructed by Thomas Marlay, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, grandfather of the Irish parliamentarian Henry Grattan. His daughter Mary was married to James Grattan, Henry Grattan's father {{and a member of}} the Irish House of <b>Commons.</b> A later <b>occupant</b> was Gerald Dease, a Catholic nobleman who entertained the Empress of Austria during her visit to Ireland. He is buried in a prominent position on front of the local Catholic church, the construction of which he helped to fund. The rock bridge in Celbridge Abbey grounds is now the oldest stone bridge across the Liffey since the removal of John Le Decer's 1308 bridge three miles downriver at Salmon Leap.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAs {{a typical}} crowded public place, fatal deaths {{are caused by}} {{ineffective}} evacuation action in large hospital {{on account of the}} special characteristics of occupants in hospital building, i. e., pathological, physiological and psychological behaviour, etc. Large amount of observation by camera and videos, as well as questionnaires were carried out in a SJ Hospital, which is the one of biggest hospitals in Shenyang. Based on that, correlation analysis was carried out between special behavioural characteristics of occupants in hospital and pedestrian walk velocity, as well as the correlation with their evacuation decision behaviour. Furthermore, evacuation simulation in the hospital building was done on the base of the fire dynamics simulation software FDS+Evac developed by NIST, USA. The investigation results illustrate that occupant walks slowly in hospital buildings at a ratio of 70 %∼ 90 % comparing with the healthy people in <b>common</b> public buildings. <b>Occupants</b> in hospital building tend to ask help to staffs of the hospital in wayfinding in the case of emergent situations. More than 1 / 3 rd of the occupants are more likely inclined to lose their idea once emergent situation occurs. The evacuation simulation illustrates that egress width and efficient evacuation instructions are the most important strategies in the efficient evacuation in hospital buildings...|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} to verify {{mortality}} rate, cause of death, severity of injury (ISS),GCS, patient fate in hospital, pattern of specific organ injuries and some other characteristics among injured pedestrians and car occupants referred to three trauma centers in Tehran (Sina hospital, Shohada Tajrich hospital, Fayazbakhsh hospital) from May 1996 until May 1997. "nMaterials and Methods: 57367 patients were admitted to emergency department of these centers among which, 6027 victims of motor-vehicle accidents were included in this study. "nResults: 71 % of cases were pedestrians and rest was car occupants. M/F ratio was 1. 8 / 5. Mean age was 29 y. Motor vehicle accidents occurred most commonly during nights. The patients' GCS at arrival in emergency department had similar distribution in both groups. The most commonly injured organs in both groups were: integument, head and neck, extremities and bony pelvis. Thoracic and spinal injuries were more <b>common</b> among car <b>occupants.</b> Extremities and boney pelvis injuries were more common among pedestrians. The mortality rate was the same between both groups. Mortality rate was affected by GCS at arrival and severity of injury. Mortality rate among the old was 4 times the rate among the children. The accidents most commonly occurred on metropolitan roads and streets. The {{most common cause of}} death between both groups was head injury. Surprisingly head injury was a more common cause of death among the car occupants.

40|$|It {{is claimed}} that small islands {{fall prey to}} {{powerful}} forces that transform place and life, creating major political, economic, social and environmental challenges simultaneously global and local in their reach and impact. This research examines whether, how {{and to what extent}} modes of governing fail or succeed to support such challenges of change. A qualitative work positioned between island studies and cultural geography, it fuses notions of island, place and governance in a case study that examines how members of a small island population dealt with global-local change. The setting was King Island, remote dependant of Australian island state Tasmania. Three methods were used: community observation by the researcher, analysis of primary and secondary documentary evidence, and the interpretation of three rounds of interviews conducted with King Islanders over six months. Data were first categorised, described and analysed in terms of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats or challenges that islanders perceived in relation to quality of life. Second, four challenges of chief significance to participants were examined in depth: governance, population, land use and tenure, and climate. Hermeneutic analysis of these four cases points to both failures and successes to manage global-local change in the short term, which participants explained in terms of particular mindsets in King Island contoured by local (island) place, and tensions over relational place with two powerful sovereign governments. Examples of the potential of governance—dealt with in depth in the final discussion—suggest that both failures and successes of various kinds and intensities are possible in small island systems. Such insights stand as conclusive and object lessons in two ways. First, what appears to be governing failure can lead to change and opportunity for growth in governing capacity and outcomes for the <b>common</b> good. Second, <b>occupants</b> of small islands can indeed find ways to manage their global-local challenges...|$|R
40|$|Design {{of motor}} {{vehicles}} had not initially focused around humans. Vehicles were merely designed to perform basic mechanical tasks. Only later designers {{took into account}} the human element, even though, in the beginning, ergonomic principles were often introduced as an interventional option {{at the end of}} the design process. The aim of ergonomics was mainly introducing further qualities, which were often perceived as accessories or part of the brand image. Only in the past decades, vehicle occupant packaging became a necessary design phase. The primary focus in occupant packaging is the driver‟s workstation, that is the location and adjustment ranges of the steering wheel and seat with respect to the pedals, the physical location of controls and displays with which the driver interacts, the analysis of interior and exterior driver visual areas, both direct and through mirrors. The objective of packaging is usually stated in terms of percentage accommodation on particular measures. Accommodation is quantified Design of motor vehicles had not initially focused around humans [2]. Vehicles were merely designed to perform basic mechanical tasks.

The aim of ergonomics was mainly introducing further qualities, which were often perceived as accessories or part of the brand image. Only in the past decades, vehicle occupant packaging became a necessary design phase. An increasing <b>common</b> approach to <b>occupant</b> packaging employs manikins to represent driver requirements. Use of three-dimensional computer graphic models has followed the development of low cost computers. Early human modelling software programs such as Sammie have been followed by Ramis, Jack and Safework among others. These digital human models (DHM) are now widely used for vehicle interior design and have often replaced SAE packaging tools. Manikins are fundamentally population models, in that they describe percentiles of a population, not the behaviour of any individual within the population. A panel of manikins would be needed to attain good estimates of population characteristics. In the attempt to reduce the number of computer analyses that must be performed, designers select the extremes that span a large percentage of the range of body dimensions in the target population. The five elements to be considered in the ergonomics of motor vehicles are:habitability, accessibility, reachability, internal and external visibility, and seating comfor...|$|R
