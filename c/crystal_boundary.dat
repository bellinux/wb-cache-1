In most cases weak links are oxide barriers between two superconducting thin films, {{but it can also be}} a <b>crystal</b> <b>boundary</b> (in the case of high-Tc superconductors). A schematic representation is given in Fig. 4. Now consider the ring which is thick everywhere except for a small section where the ring is closed via a weak link (Fig. 3b). The velocity is zero except near the weak link. In these regions the velocity contribution to the total phase change in the loop is given by (with Eq.(15)) ...|$|E
5000|$|In angle-resolved photo-emission {{spectroscopy}} (ARPES), irradiating {{light on}} a crystal sample results in the ejection of an electron away from the crystal. Throughout {{the course of the}} interaction, one is allowed to conflate the two concepts of crystal and true momentum and thereby gain direct knowledge of a crystal's band structure. That is to say, an electron's crystal momentum inside the crystal becomes its true momentum after it leaves, and the true momentum may be subsequently inferred from the equationby measuring the angle and kinetic energy at which the electron exits the crystal ( [...] is a single electron's mass). Interestingly, because crystal symmetry in the direction normal to the crystal surface is lost at the <b>crystal</b> <b>boundary,</b> crystal momentum in this direction is not conserved. Consequently, the only directions in which useful ARPES data can be gleaned are directions parallel to the crystal surface.|$|E
40|$|Normal {{temperature}} tensile {{and fatigue}} tests were adopted {{to test the}} mechanical performance and fatigue life of 2524 aluminum alloy under the three states of T 3, artificial aging, and creep aging, and scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope were also used to observe the fatigue fracture morphology and aging precipitation features of the alloy under the above three states. Results showed that the alloy treated by creep aging can obtain higher fatigue life, but that treated by artificial aging is lower than T 3; T 3 alloy is mainly dominated by GPB region. Meanwhile, the <b>crystal</b> <b>boundary</b> displays continuously distributed fine precipitated phases; after artificial aging and creep aging treatment, {{a large amount of}} needle-shaped S′ phases precipitate inside the alloy, while there are wide precipitated phases at the <b>crystal</b> <b>boundary.</b> Wide precipitation free zones appear at the <b>crystal</b> <b>boundary</b> of artificial-aging samples, but precipitation free zones at the alloy <b>crystal</b> <b>boundary</b> of creep aging become narrower and even disappear.

40|$|Abstract. When both SnO 2 {{film and}} a-Si film with {{infinite}} square resistance are deposited on an ITO film, the square {{resistance of the}} ITO film notably decreases. This phenomenon is more remarkable, when an ITO film has large square resistance. We believe that the films are composed of spaced crystalline grains. The film resistance is due to <b>crystal</b> <b>boundary</b> scattering carriers. Smaller crystalline grain and greater distance to the <b>crystal</b> <b>boundary</b> lead to fiercer scattering. The crystalline grains of the SnO 2 film and a-Si film short-circuit the spaced ITO grains to form bridges so interface electrons can flow trough...|$|E
