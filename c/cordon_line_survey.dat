40|$|Traffic {{planning}} in the Greater Copenhagen Region (have {{over the last}} 10 years mainly been supported by the so-called OTM traffic model. The behavioural models in OTM include advanced state-of-the-art utility-based formulations, which are combined with base-matrices in a pivot-correction procedure. Before and after studies of specific projects have shown, that these matrices might be the Achilles heal of the whole model system. Vuk and Hansen (2006) therefore validated the present version of the OTM traffic model (version 4. 0 from summer 2000) and concluded that a major drawback of the model was indeed outdated base 1992 matrices. From January 2005 to March 2007 the OTM model has therefore been in a large-scale process of updating where creation of new trip matrices has been the main focus. The article describes the undertaken methodology for constructing the travel matrices for Copenhagen, and how the improved matrices influence {{the performance of the}} model. A main focus in the work has been to utilise various data sources for estimation of the new matrices. This includes telephone <b>survey</b> data, <b>cordon</b> <b>line</b> <b>surveys</b> and existing transport surveys to construct the base matrices, traffic counts to adjust these, and digital network databases. The article also demonstrates a new approach to adjust public transport matrices to counts...|$|R
50|$|Validating traffic {{simulation}} models requires comparing traffic {{estimated by the}} model to observed traffic on the roadway and transit systems. Initial comparisons are for trip interchanges between quadrants, sectors, or other large areas of interest. The {{next step is to}} compare traffic estimated by the models to traffic counts, including transit ridership, crossing contrived barriers in the study area. These are typically called screenlines, cutlines, and <b>cordon</b> <b>lines</b> and may be imaginary or actual physical barriers. <b>Cordon</b> <b>lines</b> surround particular areas such as a city's central business district or other major activity centers. Transit ridership estimates are commonly validated by comparing them to actual patronage crossing <b>cordon</b> <b>lines</b> around the central business district.|$|R

30|$|In reality, {{it is not}} {{possible}} to communicate the marginal costs of all roads of the network with the drivers (i.e., tolling all roads) and expect to see a full SO traffic flow (known as first-best congestion pricing [18]). Rather, a few roads, presumably the highly congested ones, are selected as tolled roads and some fairly consistent toll rates are assigned to them (known as second-best congestion pricing [19]. Examples are the imposition of tolls on the roads forming <b>cordon</b> <b>lines</b> encompassing a central business district (CBD) or on the roads forming some screen lines which bisect the road network. One of the main challenges in the pricing schemes is the equity [20]. Equity concern is associated with the distribution of costs and benefits among the members of the society. A policy can be called equitable if it meets a normative standard of fairness (so equity means fairness). Following is one of the typical complaints: “I am living just one block after the <b>cordon</b> <b>line</b> in the CBD and my office is in the outer CBD. Beside the fact that you put my house inside the <b>cordon</b> <b>line,</b> I have no business in the CBD, so it is totally unfair to tax me.” In the USA, many congestion pricing proposals have been rejected based on worries that they are inequitable [21].|$|R
50|$|In April 1783, by decree of Catherine II, right-bank Kuban and Taman Peninsula were {{annexed to}} the Russian Empire. In the years 1792-1793 Cossacks {{moved here from}} Zaporozhye, now located in Ukraine, and formed the Black Sea Area troops, with the {{creation}} of a solid <b>cordon</b> <b>line</b> for the Kuban River and the marginalization of the neighboring Circassians.|$|R

50|$|However, {{some people}} chose even more extreme methods of expressing their {{disagreement}} with Bishop Hornyak. For example, on 18 December 1977, when Bishop Hornyak went to Gloucester {{to open the}} new Ukrainian Catholic church, he was met by around 500 demonstrators who ignored the police <b>cordon</b> <b>line</b> and attacked him, bruising his face and crushing his glasses. This forced him to retreat back into his car.|$|R
30|$|As can be noticed, the entry-based layout {{can affect}} OD pair B by {{deflecting}} flows from path 1 – 5 – 3 – 6 crossing the <b>cordon</b> <b>line</b> to path 1 – 5 – 6 which is {{external to the}} cordon. However, it cannot directly alter flow distribution of OD pair A, since all the paths between the OD pair are charged equally at the cordon stations. As a result, this plan is not fully efficient in diverting the traffic flow from the cordoned area. The distance-based scheme can obviously change the flow pattern among the routes of OD pair A, following their different traveling lengths inside the cordoned zone. On the other hand, it is unable to affect flow distribution between the paths of OD pair B, because none of them traverse the tolled links inside the zone. Hence, this toll design cannot optimally prohibit vehicles from entering the cordoned area. On the contrary, the hybrid regime yields the optimal state by diverting the flows of both OD pairs from passing over the <b>cordon</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R

Loudspeakers were used to reassure the villagers, advising them what to do, and {{providing}} a means of control. While the external cordon remained in place, 2d Company soldiers established additional <b>cordon</b> <b>lines</b> to further divide the village into three sections.

The reconstruction of the simulated data is obtained through the Maximum Entropy Method. The main factors responsible for degrading the quality of the reconstruction are taken into account: high rms noise in the data, pointing errors (particularly in the presence of intrinsic chemical structure in the source) and sideband imbalances. The presented results will allow the users of the new powerful submillimeter and THz telescopes, such as APEX, ALMA and Herschel, to make the most efficient use of their instruments for <b>line</b> <b>survey</b> work...|$|R

30|$|High {{levels of}} traffic in {{metropolis}} areas {{have become a}} critical social problem of the twenty-first century. Congestion pricing, as part of traffic demand management (TDM) strategies, is a significant economic tool which has been implemented in several cities around the world [1]. It mitigates the congestion level by encouraging the commuters enough to alter their behavior, such as their departure time, route or mode of transport [2, 3]. Congestion pricing schemes can be categorized into two groups: the first-best and the second-best strategies. In the first-best strategy, the well-known Pigouvian formula [4] {{is used to calculate}} the negative externalities which should be paid by the drivers. It is applied by charging tolls over all links of the network, so that the user equilibrium flow pattern shifts toward a socially preferred pattern. However, this is not a practical strategy, because of the political and social resistance against all roads tolled. On the other hand, the second-best policy is more acceptable to the public since it settles charges on a limited subset of the links. First applied in Singapore in 1975, cordon pricing is the most appropriate second-best policy for network authorities due to its practicality, effectiveness and social acceptance. Cordon pricing follows three main objectives in general: alleviating congestion, enhancing the environmental indices and generating revenue [5]. In the conventional form of cordon pricing, the commuters are charged on entry into a specific zone, enclosed by a hypothetical <b>cordon</b> <b>line.</b> Mostly implemented on the central business districts, this second-best strategy can reduce the intensity of congestion within the cordoned area by deflecting the routes from entry or changing the mode of transport. May et al. [6], Shepherd et al. [7, 8], Santos et al. [9], May et al. [10], Zhang and Yang [11] and Gholami et al. [12] are among those who investigated the impact of the entry-based cordon pricing on the performance of transportation systems. Although a single layer cordon has a positive effect on reducing the congestion inside, it may cause unwilling congestion outside the cordoned area. In order to tackle this deficiency, some researchers suggested that using multilayer cordons can improve the geographical coverage of cordon pricing [10, 12, 13]. May et al. [10], Zou et al. [14] and Gholami et al. [12] argued against cordon pricing by showing that there may exist more effective toll points in the whole network than on the <b>cordon</b> <b>line,</b> providing that the total number of tolled links is not changed. Based on their experiments, relaxing the constraint of keeping the <b>cordon</b> <b>line</b> closed can increase the social benefits of community. However, implementation of such a strategy encounters practical issues since it does not form a coherent geographical district and is mentally hard to be perceived and accepted by the users. May et al. [6] pointed out that cordon pricing can affect only the trips with the origins outside and the destinations inside the cordoned area. They implemented a bidirectional charging plan which can enhance the overall performance of the pricing.|$|R

40|$|We have {{initiated}} a spectral <b>line</b> <b>survey,</b> at a wavelength of 3 millimeters, toward the hot molecular core Sagittarius B 2 (N-LMH). This {{is the first}} spectral <b>line</b> <b>survey</b> of the Sgr B 2 (N) region utilizing data from both an interferometer (BIMA Array) and a single-element radio telescope (NRAO 12 meter). In this survey, covering 3. 6 GHz in bandwidth, we detected 218 lines (97 identified molecular transitions, 1 recombination line, and 120 unidentified transitions). This yields a spectral line density (lines per 100 MHz) of 6. 06, which is much larger than any previous 3 mm <b>line</b> <b>survey.</b> We also present maps from the BIMA Array that indicate that most highly saturated species (3 or more H atoms) are products of grain chemistry or warm gas phase chemistry.
