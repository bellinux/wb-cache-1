50|$|The {{black truffle}} is morphologically {{very similar to}} the commercially less {{valuable}} <b>Chinese</b> <b>truffle</b> (Tuber indicum). To avoid fraud or misidentifications in commerce, a RFLP genetic test has been developed to distinguish the two species. Externally, they can be distinguished by their skin, which is smoother and dark red or dark brown in the <b>Chinese</b> <b>truffle.</b> Two other similar truffle species are the summer truffle (Tuber aestivum) and the winter truffle (Tuber brumale), whose flesh is of a lighter color.|$|E
40|$|In this study, Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was {{employed}} to optimize the extraction conditions (extraction temperature, ratio of water to raw material and extraction time) of polysaccharides from the fruiting bodies of <b>Chinese</b> <b>truffle</b> Tuber sinense. A Box-Behnken design was used for experimental design {{and analysis of the}} results to obtain the optimal processing parameters. The optimal conditions were extraction temperature 94. 75 °C, ratio of water to raw material 16. 41 : 1, extraction time 2. 67 h. According to analysis, extraction temperature was the most significant factor to affect the yield of polysaccharides from <b>Chinese</b> <b>truffle</b> Tuber sinense. Pharmacological experiments indicated that CTP had potent immunomodulatory effects in immunosuppression mice model. At the dose of 50, 100 and 200 mg kg - 1 body weight, a significant increase (p< 0. 01) in phagocytosis of macrophage was observed...|$|E
40|$|To deeply {{explore the}} {{pharmacological}} {{activities of the}} <b>Chinese</b> <b>truffle</b> Tuber sinense (CT) in this study, three kinds of the crude polysaccharides from <b>Chinese</b> <b>Truffle</b> Tuber sinense (CTCP) were extracted by the method of water extracting-alcohol precipitating which include Water-soluble Polysaccharide (W-CTCP) and Alkali-soluble Polysaccharides (A-CTCPI, A-CTCPII) and then the polysaccharide content of the CTCP were determined. The antioxidant activities of the CTCPs were evaluated by reducing power, superoxide radical and hydroxyl radical free radical-scavenging assay. As the results, the polysaccharide (W-CTCP, A-CTCPI and A-CTCPII) content was 46. 76, 74. 05 and 57. 68 %, respectively. The polysaccharides all exhibited antioxidant activities in vitro and W-CTCP showed the strongest activity. It can be concluded that the polysaccharides extracted from CT should be explored as a potential natural antioxidant agent for use in functional foods or medicine...|$|E
30|$|The three truffle {{species in}} this study, Tuber latisporum, T. subglobosum and T. pseudohimalayense, are also {{traditional}} edible mushrooms {{with a great}} production in China. Our aim was to increase the knowledge about their chemical composition and nutritional properties, {{with regard to the}} contents of energy, carbohydrate, protein, fat, ash, free sugar and fatty acid; to investigate the antioxidant activity of these truffles, including scavenging ability for DPPH and hydroxyl radicals, reduce power, chelating effect on ferrous ion. This is the first report on the chemical constituents and antioxidant activities of the three <b>Chinese</b> <b>truffles.</b> Gas chromatography–mass spectrometer (GC–MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) techniques were applied to evaluate composition analysis, the antioxidant potential was determined using various assays.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} is to fully characterize the aroma of <b>Chinese</b> <b>truffles</b> (Tuber indicum) by headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME). To develop an objective method to extract aroma compounds, four different fibers were studied and a Box-Behnken design (BBD) was applied. From the statistical analysis of the experimental result, {{it was able to}} determine that the most important factor was the extraction temperature and the optimum extraction conditions were as follows: extraction time 20. 6 min, extraction temperature 52. 4 o C and equilibrium time 6. 8 min, By using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis under the optimal conditions, it identified 24 compounds, three of which were reported {{for the first time in}} the Chinese truffle: 2 -methylpropanal, 2, 3 -butanedione, 2 -nonanone. And we found that the highest content compound was dimethyl sulfide, followed by 3 -methylbutanal, 2 -methylbutanal, 2 -butanol and 1 -pentanol, 1 -octen- 3 -ol, all of those compounds were previously described as characteristic aroma of truffle. </p...|$|R
40|$|To {{compare the}} {{volatile}} compounds of <b>Chinese</b> black <b>truffle</b> and white truffle from Yunnan province, this study presents {{the application of}} a direct solvent extraction/solvent-assisted flavor evaporation (DSE-SAFE) coupled with a comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC) high resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HR-TOF/MS) and an electronic nose. Both of the analytical methods could distinguish the aroma profile of the two samples. In terms of the overall profile of truffle samples in this research, more kinds of acids were detected via the method of DSE-SAFE. Besides, compounds identified in black truffle (BT), but not in white truffle (WT), or vice versa, and those detected in both samples at different levels were considered {{to play an important role}} in differentiating the two samples. According to the analysis of electronic nose, the two samples could be separated, as well...|$|R
40|$|Chapitre 7 Truffles are ectomycorrhizal {{filamentous}} fungi {{belonging to}} genus Tuber naturally found across {{a range of}} climates in the Northern Hemisphere. Some truffle species such as Perigord black truffle (T. melanosporum) and the white truffle (T. magnatum) in Europe, the black <b>Chinese</b> <b>truffle</b> (T. indicum) in Asia, and the pecan truffle (T. lyonii) in North America are particularly famous due to the organoleptic qualities of their fruiting bodies and are among the world's most precious culinary delicacies. In this chapter, we summarize the recent studies pertaining to the phylogeography and biogeographic history of the genus Tuber, genomic analysis of the black truffle Tuber melanosporum, and comparative genomics towards understanding the life cycle, ecology, and evolution of Tuber species. Such understanding is critical to the anticipated future of truffle production in light of global change...|$|E
