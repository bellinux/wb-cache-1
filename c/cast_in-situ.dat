25|$|The {{parabolic}} arch {{has been associated}} with church architecture since at least the 1880s. German architect Dominikus Bohm (1880-1955) exploited the possibilities of the {{parabolic arch}} in several 1920s church designs, demonstrating that the kind of atmosphere commonly associated with Gothic architecture could be obtained with a minimum of historical allusion. Though it remained an uncommon architectural form in the early 20th century, it featured in several Modernist churches, most notably the Church of St Francis of Assisi (completed 1943) in Pampulha, Brazil, designed by Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer (1907-2012). Constructed from <b>cast</b> <b>in-situ</b> concrete, the nave of the church was a free-standing parabolic vault. Highly controversial at the time, Niemeyer's bold design was extremely influential among architects around the world (including Australia), with photographs and plans of the church published in architectural journals.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Combined SHS with <b>casting,</b> <b>in-situ</b> Al 2 O 3 particle-reinforced copper matrix {{composite}} was fabricated. The {{effects of the}} load and Al 2 O 3 particle on the friction coefficient and wear volume were investigated. And the wear resistance of composite was {{compared with that of}} pure copper. The results show that with the increase of load, the coefficient of the copper increases, while it decreases slightly as to composite. The wear volume of the composite is always lower than that of copper. The highest relative wear ability is 4. 5, which indicates a better wear resistance. ...|$|R

40|$|Water samples {{along the}} Washington, Oregon and California {{coastline}} were collected using high resolution sampling and analyzed to determine {{particulate organic carbon}} and nitrogen concentrations. Over 28 days during August 2011, nearly 1500 samples were collected aboard the R/V Wecoma (W 1108 C) using a semi-automated filtration system. Additional subsurface samples were collected from CTD <b>casts.</b> <b>In-situ</b> measurements of temperature, salinity, chlorophyll fluorescence, and beam attenuation were combined with the data from individual samples to provide a near-synoptic, spatial distribution of particulate organic matter along the California Current. Marked contrasts in the concentrations and compositions of particulate organic matter were observed among different water masses along the margin, including those directly affected by Columbia River discharge, recently upwelled near-shore waters, and filaments associated with mesoscales eddies.

40|$|In general, precast {{concrete}} structure has insufficient ductility to resist seismic load. Detailed understanding on the behaviour of {{precast concrete}} connections are limited and current researches are focused addressing this. In this study, two precast and two monolithic concrete joints for exterior beam-to-column connection were tested under cyclic loading. The installation of precast specimens was prepared using dry type method while the monolithic joints were <b>casted</b> <b>in-situ.</b> The evaluation of seismic {{performance of the}} joints was conducted by applying hysteretic reverse cyclic loading until failure. Information regarding the strength, ductility and stiffness properties of the connection were recorded and analysed. Based on the test results and damage condition, the initial design of the joint was improved. Consequently, a new joint was constructed and tested, which exhibited a better performance. Precast concrete connections showed stable load–displacement cycles and dissipated a higher energy. The structural drift obtained was up to 9. 0 %. Pinching and deterioration were attained at a drift ratio of 4. 5 %. Also, there was improvement in the tested precast joints based on deflection, plastic hinges, crack pattern and shear deformation. Thus, the precast joints had a satisfactory resistance to seismic loads...|$|R

It is notorious for being angular, with sudden changes of slope rather than a smooth arch. The flyover was closed for several months in 2008 for remedial work carried out to the road deck, with several sections replaced.

40|$|The {{effects of}} silicon {{particle}} content and testing temperature on friction and wear properties of <b>casting</b> <b>in-situ</b> silicon particle reinforced ZA 27 composites were investigated. The wear mechanisms were mainly discussed by observations of both worn surfaces and their side views. The {{results indicated that}} the variations of wear resistance with increasing of silicon particle content, at all of the testing temperatures applied, showed a similar tendency with a manner of non-monotonous change. It was surprised that the wear resistance decreased with the increase of silicon particle content from 2 vol. % to 5 vol. %, while it increased when the content was less than 2 vol. % or more than 5 vol. %. Similarly, the friction coeffi cient also did not change monotonously. The dominative wear mechanism changed from a relatively severe regime of plastic deformation accompanied by adhesion wear to a mild regime of smear, then to a very severe regime of severe plastic deformation induced wear, and fi nally again to a relatively mild regime of smear accompanied by abrasive wear as the silicon content increased. The wear resistance always decreased with elevating testing temperature, but the decrease ranges were different for the composites with different silicon contents. The friction coefficients changed irregularly for the different composites with the increase of testing temperature. Correspondingly, the wear mechanism alternated from a mild regime of smear accompanied by abrasive wear to a severe regime of plastic deformation accompanied by adhesion wear...|$|R

40|$|The Industrialized Building System (IBS) was {{introduced}} in Malaysia in 1966, but it failed to establish itself on a continuous basis though {{there has been a}} sustained large market for residential projects even since. One of the reasons behind this shortcoming is the lack of scientific data on labor productivity that could convince policy maker. Hence, the objective {{of this study is to}} develop a standardized data collection methodology for measuring and comparing the conventional building system and IBS in term of labor productivity, crew size and cycle time. Labor productivity (man hours/m 2) is defined as the man hours required to complete the structural element of one unit house. A total of 499 data points were obtained from seven residential projects constructed between January 2003 and April 2004. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) indicated that the labor productivity was significantly different between four structural building systems. The mean labor productivity for the conventional building system was 4. 20 man hours/m 2 followed by <b>cast</b> <b>in-situ</b> table form (2. 70 man hours/m 2), <b>cast</b> <b>in-situ</b> half tunnel form (1. 88 man hours/m 2) and pre-cast concrete system (1. 33 man hours/m 2). Further, the analysis of crew size indicated that the mean crew size of a conventional building system of 24 workers was significantly different from the IBS of 22 workers. However, the crew size within the IBS was found to be insignificant. The cycle time measured in days per house was found to be significantly different between structural building systems with the conventional building system of 4. 9 days, <b>cast</b> <b>in-situ</b> table form of 3. 9 days, <b>cast</b> <b>in-situ</b> half tunnel form of 2. 9 days and pre-cast concrete system for 2. 3 days.
