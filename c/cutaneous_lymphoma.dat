2500|$|The {{cancer is}} {{classified}} into {{low and high}} grade types. [...] Classification is also based on location. [...] The four location types are multicentric, mediastinal, gastrointestinal, and extranodal (involving the kidney, central nervous system, skin, heart, or eye). [...] Multicentric lymphoma, {{the most common type}} (by greater than 80 percent), is found in the lymph nodes, with or without involvement in the liver, spleen, or bone marrow. [...] Mediastinal lymphoma occurs in the lymph nodes in the thorax and possibly the thymus. [...] Gastrointestinal lymphoma occurs as either a solitary tumor or diffuse invasion of the stomach or intestines, with or without involvement in the surrounding lymph nodes, liver or spleen. [...] Classification is further based on involvement of B-lymphocytes or T-lymphocytes. [...] Approximately 70 percent are B-cell lymphoma. [...] <b>Cutaneous</b> <b>lymphoma</b> can be classified as epitheliotropic (closely conforming to the epidermis) or non-epitheliotropic. [...] The epitheliotropic form is typically of T-cell origin and is also called mycosis fungoides. [...] The non-epitheliotropic form is typically of B-cell origin.|$|E

40|$|The {{symposium}} {{discussed the}} pathobiology, classification, {{and treatment of}} <b>cutaneous</b> <b>lymphomas.</b> Drs.

A proposed classification of primary <b>cutaneous</b> <b>lymphomas</b> from the EORTC was presented by Drs. Kerl and Sterry. Dr. Jaffe presented a classification of <b>cutaneous</b> <b>lymphomas</b> based on the REAL classification.

40|$|<b>Cutaneous</b> <b>lymphomas</b> are {{heterogeneous}} {{and distinct}} entities {{which have been}} in controversy {{since the time of}} conception. WHO EORTC defined them as distinct pathological entity compared to the nodal counterpart. They are defined as <b>lymphomas</b> having primary <b>cutaneous</b> presentation without any systemic involvement. As such the diagnosis of <b>cutaneous</b> <b>lymphomas</b> is a diagnosis of exclusion. These lymphomas are distinct from the nodal lymphomas in their presentation, behaviour and prognosis. These lymphomas have been divided into B cell and T cell type based on the presence of predominance of atypical lymphocytes of B or T lineage. The most common <b>cutaneous</b> <b>lymphomas</b> are T cell immunophenotype, and Mycosis fungoides constitutes the majority of <b>cutaneous</b> <b>lymphomas.</b> <b>Cutaneous</b> <b>lymphomas</b> needs to be differentiated from pseudolymphomas which are benign proliferation of lymphoid cells mimicking lymphomas and mostly have a benign cours...|$|R
40|$|Primary <b>cutaneous</b> <b>lymphomas</b> {{comprise}} a prognostically heterogeneous group of lymphocytic skin neoplasms, which display {{a broad spectrum}} of clinical, histologic, immunophenotypic, and genetic features. The histopathological examination plays an essential role and is often the starting point in the diagnostic workup of <b>cutaneous</b> <b>lymphomas.</b> In most cases, the histopathological and the phenotypic analysis alone are limited to provide a list of differential diagnoses. As a consequence of overlapping clinical, histologic, phenotypic, and genetic features among several entities of <b>cutaneous</b> <b>lymphomas,</b> the clinicopathological correlation is of utmost importance to achieve the final diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|Primary <b>cutaneous</b> <b>lymphomas</b> {{represent}} {{the second most}} frequent type of extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) after gastrointestinal lymphomas [9]. The worldwide annual incidence of primary <b>cutaneous</b> <b>lymphomas</b> {{is estimated to be}} 1 : 100, 000 [1, 6, 9]. Despite the existence of several large, often clinic-based registries dealing with <b>cutaneous</b> <b>lymphomas</b> (Netherlands Lymphoma Registry, Lymphoma Registry Graz/Austria, Lymphoma Registry Stanford/USA, German Registry for <b>Cutaneous</b> <b>Lymphomas,</b> National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (NCI SEER)) there is a paucity of comparable population-based data concerning this group of diseases. Until 2005, one of the main obstacles for the correct reporting was the lack of appropriate classification to cover all clinicopathological entities, when the new WHO-EORTC was introduced [23]. The comparison of age distribution in different lymphoma registries shows that primary <b>cutaneous</b> <b>lymphomas</b> most commonly arise in older adults, with a median onset time after 60 years of age [1]. One exception to this distribution is lymphomatoid papulosis, which often develops in young adults and can even manifest in childhood [2].

50|$|Sézary {{disease is}} a type of <b>cutaneous</b> <b>lymphoma</b> that was first {{described}} by Albert Sézary.

40|$|Primary <b>cutaneous</b> <b>lymphomas</b> are a {{heterogeneous}} group of diseases.

50|$|Histiocytoma is a common, benign, {{cutaneous}} neoplasm in dogs. Histiocytomas usually {{occur as}} solitary lesions, which spontaneously regress, and seldom recur. They {{can occur in}} dogs of all ages, but are more likely in dogs under three years of age. Epidermal invasion by cells of histiocytoma frequently occurs and intra-epidermal nests of histiocytes resemble Pautrier's aggregates, characteristically found in epidermotropic lymphoma (Mycosis Fungoides or MF). Epidermal invasion in histiocytoma, or presence of simultaneous multiple histiocytomas, especially in aged dogs, can appear similar to MF or non-epidermotropic <b>cutaneous</b> <b>lymphoma</b> (NECL).Multiple histiocytomas may look like cutaneous histiocytosis, although morphologically histiocytomas are consistently epidermotropic and commonly epidermally invasive, these are not features of cutaneous histiocytosis. Delayed regression of multiple histiocytomas can occur and lesions can persist for up to 10 months.|$|E
50|$|Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is best {{performed}} on frozen sections of tumor (not formalin fixed material!). Histiocytoma is readily distinguished from other histiocytic disorders and <b>cutaneous</b> <b>lymphoma</b> {{with the aid}} of IHC. Our work has clearly shown that histiocytomas have the phenotype of epidermal Langerhans cells. They express CD1a, CD1b, CD1c, MHC class II, CD11c, and E-cadherin. Amongst leukocytes, E-cadherin expression is unique to Langerhans cells. Langerhans cells utilize E-cadherin to localize in the epidermis via homotypic interaction with E-cadherin expressed by keratinocytes. Histiocytomas lack expression of CD4 and Thy-1, which are consistently expressed by histiocytes in cutaneous and systemic histiocytosis. Hence cutaneous histiocytoma is a localized epidermal Langerhans cell tumor, and the rare examples of systemic spread of histiocytoma are best characterized as Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) similar to that observed in humans.|$|E

5000|$|PVA {{usually has}} an {{underlying}} cause, attributed to existing skin diseases and disorders {{associated with a}} <b>cutaneous</b> <b>lymphoma</b> or inflammation. Mycosis fungoides is the common lymphoma believed to cause PVA, {{although it may be}} considered a precursor when the lymphoma is [...] (hidden) and undiagnosed. Large plaque parapsoriasis is another common causes of PVA. Less common causes include autoimmune-related connective tissue diseases such as lupus, dermatomyositis and scleroderma. Dermatoses and those that are genetically inspired, called genodermatoses, may also be an underlying cause of PVA. Among them, xeroderma pigmentosum and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (poikiloderma congenita) are thought to be the most prominent. Ingestion of substances containing arsenic, such as arsphenamine, has also been suggested as a least common cause. PVA can also be idiopathic (of unknown cause), as seen in a small number of cases.|$|E
