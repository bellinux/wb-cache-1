40|$|In {{this report}} an {{overview}} of the results on the development of a single-chip superconducting integrated receiver for the Terahertz Limb Sounder (TELIS) balloon project intended to measure a variety of stratosphere trace gases is presented. The Superconducting Integrated Receiver (SIR) comprises in one chip a planar antenna integrated with a superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) mixer, a superconducting Flux Flow Oscillator (FFO) acting as Local Oscillator (LO) and a second SIS harmonic mixer (HM) for FFO phase locking. As a result of the FFO design optimization a free-running linewidth between 9 and 1. 5 MHz has been measured in the frequency range 500 - 710 GHz resulting in phase-locking of 35 to 95 % of the FFO power correspondingly. A new generation of the SIR devices with improved FFO performance and optimized interface between FFO and SIS/HM has been developed and comprehensively tested. As a result all required TELIS parameters were demonstrated., Phase-locked FFO operation over entire SIR <b>channel</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>range</b> has been realized, spectral resolution below 1 MHz has been confirmed by gas cell and CW signal measurements. An uncorrected double side band (DSB) noise temperature below 250 K has been measured with the phase-locked FFO. The intermediate frequency bandwidth 4 - 8 GHz; has been realized. To ensure remote operation of the phase-locked SIR several procedures for its automatic computer control have been developed and tested...|$|E

40|$|Remote sensing using readily {{available}} communication signal transmitted by ORBCOMM satellites {{at very high}} <b>frequency</b> (VHF) <b>range</b> (137 - 138 MHz) is a promising method for detecting the root zone soil moisture content. The radio wave reflectivity of soil is strongly correlated to soil moisture content. Therefore, if {{we were able to}} measure the reflectivity, {{we might be able to}} estimate the soil moisture content. In this preliminary study, we analyze direct signal data from the satellites to investigate and verify communication <b>channels</b> in <b>frequency</b> <b>range</b> of interest and their characteristics (bandwidth, pattern, etc.). The analysis of direct signal data is also used for calibrating signal collection systems and compensating for the subtle differences of systems. After comparing the satellite geometry and spectrum from raw signal, we verified that ORBCOMM has 13 <b>channels</b> in our <b>frequency</b> <b>range</b> of interest. It was also verified that among these 13 channels, the <b>channel</b> with center <b>frequency</b> at 137. 56 MHz is a public channel shared by all satellites and is not suitable for reflectivity computation in that multiple satellites could be in sight by our antenna and the signal reflecting region cannot be determined. In our long duration (~ 12 hours) analysis, we observed the visible duration and period of the satellites. Conclusively, using ORBCOMM communication signal for sensing the soil moisture is viable.

Around 10 kHz, the bacterial cells were directed towards the IDE center thanks to AC electroosmosis (AC-EO) and the sensor capacitance linearly increased, achieving a limit of detection (LoD) of 3. 5 × 105 CFU mL− 1 after an incubation time of 20 min with Staphylococcus epidermidis. At 63 MHz precisely, a resonance effect due to the device was found to dramatically increase the trapping of S. epidermidis on the sensor periphery, due to the combined actions of short-range contactless dielectrophoresis (cDEP) and long-range Joule heating electrothermal (J-ET) flow. Thanks to a flow-based method, the bacterial cells were redirected towards the sensor center and an LoD of 105 CFU mL− 1 was achieved within 20 min of incubation, which is almost two orders of magnitude better than the impedimetric sensor alone. Analytical models and 2 D simulations using the Maxwell stress tensor (MST) provide a comprehensive analysis of the experimental results, especially about the spectral balance between cDEP, AC-EO and J-ET accounting for the 33 -nm thick insulating layer atop the electrodes.
