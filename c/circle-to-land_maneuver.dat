50|$|It is {{very common}} for a <b>circle-to-land</b> <b>maneuver</b> to be {{executed}} during a straight-in approach to a different runway, e.g., an ILS approach to one runway, followed by a low-altitude transition, ending in a landing on another (not necessarily parallel) runway. This way, approach procedures to one runway {{can be used to}} land on any runway at the airport, as the other runways might lack instrument procedures or their approaches cannot be used for other reasons (traffic considerations, navigation aids being out of service, etc.).|$|E
50|$|Circle-to-land is a {{maneuver}} {{initiated by}} the pilot to align the aircraft with a runway for landing when a straight-in landing from an instrument approach is not possible or is not desirable, and only after ATC authorization has been obtained and the pilot has established and maintains required visual reference to the airport. A <b>circle-to-land</b> <b>maneuver</b> is an alternative to a straight-in landing. It is a maneuver used when a runway is not aligned within 30 degrees of the final approach course of the instrument approach procedure or the final approach requires 400 feet (or more) of descent per nautical mile, and therefore requires some visual maneuvering of the aircraft {{in the vicinity of}} the airport after the instrument portion of the approach is completed to align the aircraft with the runway for landing.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the flight}} was [...] from runway 34 and at an {{altitude}} of , air traffic control instructed the crew to continue the approach and report as soon as they had established visual contact with the runway. The crew acknowledged the call and prepared the aircraft for landing, deploying the landing gear and extending the flaps. Continuing to descend, the aircraft reached its minimum descent altitude (MDA) of [...] – the lowest altitude to which descent is authorized on final approach or during <b>circle-to-land</b> <b>maneuvering</b> in execution of a standard instrument approach procedure where no electronic glideslope is provided (the airport was not equipped with an instrument landing system) – but both pilots said that they still had no visual reference to the runway or its approach lighting system because of the thick fog. One pilot discerned some lights in the distance but was not sure what exactly they belonged to.|$|R
50|$|The minimum descent {{altitude}} (MDA) is {{the lowest}} altitude, expressed in feet above mean sea level, to which descent is authorized on final approach or during <b>circle-to-land</b> <b>maneuvering</b> in execution of a standard instrument approach procedure where no electronic glideslope is provided. Unlike with DH or DA, a missed approach need not be initiated immediately upon reaching the altitude. A pilot flying a non-precision approach may descend to the MDA and maintain it until reaching the missed approach point (MAP), then initiate a missed approach if the required visual reference was not obtained. An aircraft must not descend below the MDA until visual reference is obtained, and which the aircraft can land while performing normal maneuvers, which differs slightly from a DH/DA in that while the missed approach procedure must be initiated at or prior to the DH/DA, because of its vertical momentum, during a precision approach an aircraft may end up descending slightly below the DH/DA {{during the course of}} the missed approach.|$|R
50|$|When {{the flight}} was 8 nmi km from runway 34 and at an {{altitude}} of 5000 ft, air traffic control instructed the crew to continue the approach and report as soon as they had established visual contact with the runway. The crew acknowledged the call and prepared the aircraft for landing, deploying the landing gear and extending the flaps. Continuing to descend, the aircraft reached its minimum descent altitude (MDA) of 2800 ft - the lowest altitude to which descent is authorized on final approach or during <b>circle-to-land</b> <b>maneuvering</b> in execution of a standard instrument approach procedure where no electronic glideslope is provided (the airport was not equipped with an instrument landing system) - but both pilots said that they still had no visual reference to the runway or its approach lighting system because of the thick fog.
