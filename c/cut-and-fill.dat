The THI&E's busier lines had color signal block protection which was rare at the time. Many interurbans, including the other major Indiana interurbans and in particular Union Traction, suffered major wrecks as the result of few or no block signals.

40|$|Gully <b>cut-and-fill</b> {{dynamics}} {{are often}} {{thought to be}} driven by climate and/or deforestation related to population pressure. However, in this case-study of nine representative catchments in the Northern Ethiopian Highlands, we find that neither climate changes nor deforestation can explain gully morphology changes over the twentieth century. Firstly, by using a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate historical catchment-wide curve numbers, we show that the landscape was already heavily degraded in the nineteenth and early twentieth century – a period with low population density. The mean catchment-wide curve number (> 80) one century ago was, under the regional climatic conditions, already resulting in considerable simulated historical runoff responses. Secondly, twentieth century land-cover and runoff coefficient changes were confronted with twentieth century changing gully morphologies. As the results show, large-scale land-cover changes and deforestation cannot explain the observed processes. The study therefore invokes interactions between authigenic factors, small-scale plot boundary changes, cropland management and sociopolitical forces to explain the gully cut processes. Finally, semi-structured interviews and sedistratigraphic analysis of three filled gullies confirm the dominant impact of (crop) land management (tillage, check dams in gullies and channel diversions) on gully <b>cut-and-fill</b> processes. Since agricultural land management – including land tenure and land distribution – has been commonly neglected in earlier related research, we argue therefore that it can be a very strong driver of twentieth century gully morphodynamics...|$|E
40|$|Channel-scale {{sedimentary}} units {{associated with}} bedrock-controlled riffle-pool morphology are examined in detail along Sandy Creek gorge, an ephemeral stream in arid south-eastern central Australia. Pool-fills comprise <b>cut-and-fill</b> assemblages of poorly sorted sediments ranging in texture from muds to boulders. Five unit types are defined based on particle size, sedimentary structures, geometry and bounding surface character: (1) coarse-grained bar platform; (2) fine-grained bar supraplatform; (3) fine-grained pool-fill; (4) fine-grained bench; and (5) modern pool-fill. The last coarse-grained unit currently lining the pools suggests an altered sedimentation style over the post-settlement period (post-AD 1860 s). Situated at bedrock valley constrictions, pool-fills are {{compared with other}} sedimentary units associated with recirculating currents: eddy bars and slackwater deposits. But only the fine-grained bench units reflect eddy recirculation; the pool-fills are principally forced-bars associated with bedrock-controlled or 2 ̆ 7 forced 2 ̆ 7 riffle-pool morphology. A late Holocene palaeoflood history is proposed based on radiocarbon ages from the pool-fills: multiple phases of <b>cut-and-fill</b> activity were preceded by a superflood 3400 - 1900 years ago that eroded the pool-fills to bedrock. The resilience of the pool-fills was illustrated by {{the passage of a}} 1 -in- 100 -year flood in 1992, which caused only minor erosion. The presence of pool-fills may provide a window to past phases of river activity that cannot be extracted from either historical records/observations or palaeoflood slackwater sediment analyses.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effects of}} {{downstream}} base-level control on fluvial architecture and geometry are well explored in several broadly similar sequence-stratigraphic models. Cretaceous Dakota Group strata, U. S. Western Interior, have characteristics reflecting combined downstream and upstream base-level controls that these models cannot address. Particularly, three layers of amalgamated channel-belt sandstone within this group thicken and are continuous for distances (# 300 km) along dip that stretch the reasonable lengths for which these models {{are intended to}} apply. As well, architecture in up-dip reaches records repeated valley-scale <b>cut-and-fill</b> cycles. This contrasts with equivalent strata down dip which record channel-scale lateral migration with no such valley-scale cycles apparent. We here introduce the concept of ‘‘buffers and buttresses’ ’ to address these observations. We assume that river longitudinal profiles are each anchored down dip to some physical barrier (e. g., the sea strand, etc.) that we refer to as a ‘‘buttress. ’ ’ Buttress shift is considered the primary downstream control on base level. Profiles extrapolated up dip from the buttress over any modeled duration of buttress shift can range widely because of high-frequency variability in upstream base-level controls (e. g., discharge, etc.). All these potential profiles however are bounded above by the profile of highest possible aggradation, and below by the profile of maximum possible incision. These upper and lower profiles are ‘‘buffers,’ ’ and they envelop the available fluvial preservation space. Thickness of the buffer zone is determined by variability in upstream controls and should increase up dip to the limit of downstream profile dominance. Dakota valley-scale surfaces record repeated <b>cut-and-fill</b> cycles driven by up-di...|$|E

It mainly focus on the rock mechanics and financial aspects with comparisons to the mining methods adhered by the Sri Lankan mining industry. The major graphite occurrence discovered more than hundred years has produced highly valued the world over. In Sri Lanka, graphite mineralizations occur in the form of rich veins with steep dips in the South-Western sector of the island, the vast stretch of area which has been famous for graphite mining with thousands of pits in operation during the high demand of the first and second world wars.

40|$|The {{application}} of underground pre-concentration technology to narrow vein mining {{has the potential}} to change the entire economics of bulk mining methods when used in narrow vein situations.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} facing mining engineers when dealing with deep, hard rock mines is to prevent and/or reduce rockburst hazard around mine openings. Rockburst is a phenomenon which is characterised by violent rock failure. The current research focuses on the assessment and control of rockbursts in deep, hard rock mines. Strainbursts, or strain-type rockbursts, occur {{in the vicinity of}} mine openings and are generally provoked by high stress conditions in a brittle rock mass. A new theory has been developed for the assessment of the potential of violent rock failure by strainburst, in underground hard rock mines. In this theory, the mining-induced energy parameters are used to calculate the so-called burst potential index (BPI). When the BPI reaches or exceeds 100 %, the method predicts a burst prone situation. One of the most commonly used methods to control strainbursts in hard rock mines is destress blasting. Motivated by the lack of a dedicated analysis tool to help assess destress blasting, a new, geomechanical model was developed. The technique employs two newly introduced parameters, alpha, a rock fragmentation factor, and beta, a stress dissipation factor, inside the modelled, fractured zone. Implemented in a 3 -dimensional finite element code developed by the author, the new model simulates the damage zone induced by destress blasting of a mining face to help evaluate the efficiency of destress blasting. Extensive model verification and parametric studies have been undertaken. The effects of the destress blasting pattern, premining stresses and their orientation, and the two destress blasting factors (rock fragmentation factor, and stress dissipation factor) are studied. The model has been applied successfully to Canadian mine case histories. A detailed case study of a <b>cut-and-fill</b> mine stope involving crown and sill pillar destressing has been carried out.

40|$|Fluvial <b>cut-and-fill</b> {{sequences}} {{have frequently}} been reported from various sites on Earth. Nevertheless, {{the information about}} the past erosional regime and hydrological conditions have not yet been adequately deciphered from these archives. The Quaternary terrace sequences in the Pisco valley, located at ca. 13 °S, offer a manifestation of an orbitally-driven cyclicity in terrace construction where phases of sediment accumulation have been related to the Minchin (48 – 36 ka) and Tauca (26 – 15 ka) lake level highstands on the Altiplano. Here, we present a 10 Be-based sediment budget for the <b>cut-and-fill</b> terrace sequences in this valley to quantify the orbitally forced changes in precipitation and erosion. We find that the Minchin period was characterized by an erosional pulse along the Pacific coast where denudation rates reached values as high as 600 ± 80 mm/ka 600 ± 80 mm/ka for a relatively short time span lasting a few thousands of years. This contrasts to the younger pluvial periods and the modern situation when 10 Be-based sediment budgets register nearly zero erosion at the Pacific coast. We relate these contrasts to different erosional conditions between the modern and the Minchin time. First, the sediment budget infers a precipitation pattern that matches with the modern climate ca. 1000 km farther north, where highly erratic and extreme El Niño-related precipitation results in fast erosion and flooding along the coast. Second, the formation of a thick terrace sequence requires sufficient material on catchment hillslopes to be stripped off by erosion. This was most likely the case immediately {{before the start of the}} Minchin period, because this erosional epoch was preceded by a > 50 ka-long time span with poorly erosive climate conditions, allowing for sufficient regolith to build up on the hillslopes. Finally, this study suggests a strong control of orbitally and ice sheet forced latitudinal shifts of the ITCZ on the erosional gradients and sediment production on the western escarpment of the Peruvian Andes at 13 ° during the Minchin period...|$|E

The results showed that large-scale ground subsidence basin has been developed in the mine area, and the ground fissures mainly scattered in the tensile zone of the subsidence basin. Besides, ground fissures have the features of compressive shear or tensile mechanical properties and zonary pattern. Unfortunately, with the mining scale keep expanding, both the quantity and width of the ground fissures increased rapidly. This will be unfavourable to safety of mining and engineering facilities. Therefore, strengthened monitoring and prevention works are essentially important to the similar mines which designed with <b>cut-and-fill</b> mining method...|$|E

Included in this section are management practices that can be applied during the sit...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines, in a {{cooperative}} project with the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, and Homestake Mining Co., Lead, SD, conducted in situ monitoring and numerical modeling of rock masses supported with cable bolts in two mechanized, <b>cut-and-fill</b> stopes and a shaft pillar at the Homestake Mine. Extensometers {{were used to}} measure rock displacement, while cable bolt strain gauges were installed to measure loads on both conventional and birdcage cable bolt supports. These instruments provided an assessment of rock mass behavior during mining as well as essential data for verifying results from computer analyses. The numerical modeling program FLAC was used to analyze cable bolt patterns and supports. Results from the evaluation study indicated that cable bolt strain gauges and extensometers were effective instruments for monitoring the behavior of rock masses supported with cable bolts. Also, numerical modeling of the 4 S- 48 N stope using the FIAC code provided displacement values comparable with measurements from field extensometers...|$|E
40|$|The India National Gas Hydrate Program (NGHP) Expedition 01 {{discovered}} {{gas hydrate}} deposits in numerous geologically complex areas in Indian Offshore. This study utilizes 3 -D seismic data and seismic attribute analyses to delineate the gas hydrate occurrences in two distinct geologic settings in the Krishna-Godhavari (KG) Basin. Investigations at Site NGHP- 01 - 10 showed a complex fractured reservoir with gas hydrate occurring in veins and fractures in fine grain mud. Seismic coherency analyses {{were used to}} delineate the special extent of the fractured gas hydrate occurrence and showed a strong linkage to a nearby north-trending fault system and an underlying conventional gas reservoir. Site NGHP- 01 - 15, ~ 40 km north of Site NGHP- 01 - 10, is instead dominated by conventional slope-related channel <b>cut-and-fill</b> sequences. A channel cutting through the sediments around Site NGHP- 01 - 15 was identified, characterized by bright amplitude anomalies within the levee sequences (identified through seismic sweetness attribute) ...|$|E
40|$|Rivers {{draining}} the semiarid Transhimalayan Ranges {{at the western}} Tibetan Plateau margin underwent alternating phases of massive valley infill and incision in Pleistocene times. The effects of these <b>cut-and-fill</b> cycles on millennial sediment fluxes have remained largely elusive. We investigate the timing and geomorphic consequences of headward incision of the Zanskar River, a tributary to the Indus, which taps the 3 ̆e 250 -m thick More Plains valley fill that currently plugs the endorheic high-altitude basins of Tso Kar and Tso Moriri. In situ 10 Be exposure dating and topographic analyses show that a phase of valley infill gave way to net dissection and the NW Himalaya 2 ̆ 7 s first directly dated stream capture in late Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6, ∼ 135 ka ago. Headwaters of the Indus are currently capturing headwaters of the Sutlej, and rivers have eroded 3 ̆e 14. 7 km 3 of sediment from the Zanskar headwaters since, mobilising an equivalent of ∼ 8...|$|E
40|$|Absolute-dated high {{frequency}} (Milankovitch cycles) marine climate/sealevel oscillatory stratigraphy can be correlated generally with continental stratigraphies. Improvements in absolute dating of Neogene formations across the North American Great Plains {{make this a}} candidate area in which to correlate marine and continental stratigraphies. Mid-latitude continental areas respond directly to climate variations. During glaciated/ cold climates, sealevel lowering results in steepened river gradients, increased erosion all along the river channel, and larger stress-bed loads. This, combined with glacial catastrophic flooding, produces greater <b>cut-and-fill</b> sequences along river systems than crevasse splays along the emergent coastal plain, deltas along the shelf, and submarine fans on the slope. Eustatic sea-level oscillations for the Tertiary are accepted as driven by glacial accumulations on the continents. Great Plains climate over the past 65 million years apparently has changed from generally nonseasonal, humid tropical to ever drier and cooler with seasonal variations accentuated. Absolute correlation between the available marine and continental is sufficiently tenuous, given the uncertainties of the various age dates, that only general pattern similarities may be recognized. Detailed verification must wait...|$|E
