5|$|For {{most of its}} distribution, B.integrifolia occurs {{only within}} about 50 {{kilometres}} (30mi) of the coast, where it typically occurs on poor quality sandy soils derived from sandstone. It grows near coastal cliffs and headlands, alongside river estuaries, and even on stabilised sand dunes. The temperature range for this area is around 0–30°C (30–85°F), with almost no frosts. The species <b>can</b> <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> pure stands, but is usually associated with other species such as Melaleuca quinquenervia (broad-leaved paperbark).|$|E
50|$|In most Germanic languages, lax vowels <b>can</b> <b>occur</b> only <b>in</b> closed syllables. Therefore, these vowels {{are also}} called checked vowels, {{as opposed to}} the tense vowels that are called free vowels because they <b>can</b> <b>occur</b> even <b>in</b> open syllables.|$|R

5|$|Hepatic {{encephalopathy}} <b>can</b> <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> {{those with}} acute or chronic liver disease. Episodes can {{be triggered by}} infections, GI bleeding, constipation, electrolyte problems, or certain medications. The underlying mechanism is believed to involve the build up of ammonia in the blood, a substance that is normally removed by the liver. The diagnosis is typically made after ruling out other potential causes. It may be supported by blood ammonia levels, an electroencephalogram, or a CT scan of the brain.|$|E
5|$|In summer, the {{dragonfly}} pond {{can hold}} up to ten species of dragonflies and damselflies. The nationally scarce moth flame wainscot has bred at Titchwell since 1996; other Lepidoptera may include migrants such as the painted lady, the diamondback moth, and especially the silver Y, which <b>can</b> <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> huge numbers; 90,000 were recorded on the reserve in July 2010, feeding on sea lavender.|$|E
5|$|It is even {{possible}} {{that in any}} one generation no marbles of a particular colour are chosen, meaning they have no offspring. In this example, if no red marbles are selected, the jar representing the new generation contains only blue offspring. If this happens, the red allele has been lost permanently in the population, while the remaining blue allele has become fixed: all future generations are entirely blue. In small populations, fixation <b>can</b> <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> just a few generations.|$|E

5|$|Selenium {{deficiency}} {{is rare in}} otherwise healthy, well-nourished individuals. It <b>can</b> <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> {{patients with}} severely compromised intestinal function, those undergoing total parenteral nutrition, and in those of advanced age (over 90). Also, people dependent on food grown from selenium-deficient soil are at risk. Although New Zealand soil has low levels of selenium, adverse health effects have not been detected in the residents.|$|E
5|$|These <b>can</b> <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> sea breezes or {{in desert}} regions. In a sea-breeze front, cold {{air from the}} sea meets the warmer air from the land and creates a {{boundary}} between two masses of air like a shallow cold front. Glider pilots can gain altitude by flying along the intersection {{as if it were}} a ridge of land. Convergence may occur over considerable distances and so may permit virtually straight flight while climbing.|$|E

5|$|Tunneling {{diffusion}} is {{a physical}} manifestation of the quantum tunneling effect involving particles tunneling across diffusion barriers. It <b>can</b> <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> the case of low diffusing particle mass and low Ediff, and has been observed {{in the case of}} hydrogen diffusion on tungsten and copper surfaces. The phenomenon is unique in that in the regime where the tunneling mechanism dominates, the diffusion rate is nearly temperature-independent.|$|E

5|$|A base such as spermine {{has a few}} {{different}} {{sites where}} protonation <b>can</b> <b>occur.</b> <b>In</b> this example the first proton can go on the terminal –NH2 group, or either of the internal –NH– groups. The pKa values for dissociation of spermine protonated at one or other of the sites are examples of micro-constants. They cannot be determined directly by means of pH, absorbance, fluorescence or NMR measurements. Nevertheless, the site of protonation {{is very important for}} biological function, so mathematical methods have been developed for the determination of micro-constants.C NMR Data Processed by the New Computer Program HypNMR2000.

5|$|Cognitive {{disturbances}} <b>can</b> <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> {{the early}} stages of the disease and sometimes prior to diagnosis, and increase in prevalence with duration of the disease. The most common cognitive deficit in PD is executive dysfunction, which can include problems with planning, cognitive flexibility, abstract thinking, rule acquisition, inhibiting inappropriate actions, initiating appropriate actions, working memory, and control of attention. Other cognitive difficulties include slowed cognitive processing speed, impaired recall and impaired perception and estimation of time. Nevertheless, improvement appears when recall is aided by cues. Visuospatial difficulties are also part of the disease, seen for example when the individual is asked to perform tests of facial recognition and perception of the orientation of drawn lines. A person with PD has two to six times the risk of dementia compared to the general population.|$|E
5|$|Generally, in {{cabinets}} or {{display cases}} that are entirely or partially made of wood, the hydrolysis of acetyl groups in the wood hemicelluloses creates acetic acid. The {{rate at which the}} acetic acid is produced is proportional to the concentration of esters in the wood, the humidity, the temperature, and the overall acidity of the environment. Acidic fumes can also be released from formaldehyde which <b>can</b> <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> wood as a degradation product of lignin. Acidic fumes can also be given off from ubiquitous formaldehyde resins (commonly urea-formaldehyde resins).|$|E
5|$|Idiopathic {{intracranial}} hypertension {{is a condition}} of unknown cause characterised by a rise in CSF pressure.

Management may include ceasing any known causes, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor such as acetazolamide, repeated drainage via lumbar puncture, or the insertion of a shunt such as a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to completeness of injury, {{the location of}} damage on the spinal cord influences how much sexual function is retained or regained after injury. Injuries <b>can</b> <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> the cervical (neck), thoracic (back), lumbar (lower back), or sacral (pelvic) levels. Between each pair of vertebrae, spinal nerves branch off of the spinal cord and carry information to and from specific parts of the body. The location of injury to the spinal cord maps to the body, and the area of skin innervated by a specific spinal nerve, is called a dermatome. All dermatomes {{below the level of}} injury to the spinal cord may lose sensation.|$|E
5|$|Many prokaryotic {{genes are}} {{organized}} into operons, with multiple protein-coding sequences that are transcribed as a unit. The genes in an operon are transcribed {{as a continuous}} messenger RNA, {{referred to as a}} polycistronic mRNA. The term cistron in this context is equivalent to gene. The transcription of an operon’s mRNA is often controlled by a repressor that <b>can</b> <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> an active or inactive state depending on the presence of certain specific metabolites. When active, the repressor binds to a DNA sequence {{at the beginning of the}} operon, called the operator region, and represses transcription of the operon; when the repressor is inactive transcription of the operon can occur (see e.g. Lac operon). The products of operon genes typically have related functions and are involved in the same regulatory network.|$|E
5|$|On average, IIH {{occurs in}} about one per 100,000 people, and <b>can</b> <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> {{children}} and adults. The median age at diagnosis is 30. IIH occurs predominantly in women, {{especially in the}} ages 20 to 45, who are four to eight {{times more likely than}} men to be affected. Overweight and obesity strongly predispose a person to IIH: women who are more than ten percent over their ideal body weight are thirteen times more likely to develop IIH, and this figure goes up to nineteen times in women who are more than twenty percent over their ideal body weight. In men this relationship also exists, but the increase is only five-fold in those over 20 percent above their ideal body weight.|$|E
