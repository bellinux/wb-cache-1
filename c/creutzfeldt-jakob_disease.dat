Infection may be of the meninges (meningitis), the brain matter (encephalitis), or within the brain matter (such as a cerebral abscess).

5|$|Many {{different}} mammalian {{species can}} be affected by prion diseases, as the prion protein (PrP) is very similar in all mammals. Due to small differences in PrP between different species it is unusual for a prion disease to transmit from one species to another.

5|$|An {{experimental}} vaccine {{was found}} to clear the amyloid plaques in early human trials, {{but it did not}} have any significant effect on dementia. Researchers have been led to suspect non-plaque Aβ oligomers (aggregates of many monomers) as the primary pathogenic form of Aβ. These toxic oligomers, also referred to as amyloid-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs), bind to a surface receptor on neurons and change the structure of the synapse, thereby disrupting neuronal communication. One receptor for Aβ oligomers may be the prion protein, the same protein that has been linked to mad cow disease and the related human condition, <b>Creutzfeldt–Jakob</b> <b>disease,</b> thus potentially linking the underlying mechanism of these neurodegenerative disorders with that of Alzheimer's disease.|$|E

An example of such a conformational disease is ALAD porphyria, which results from a mutation of porphobilinogen synthase that causes a shift in its morpheein equilibrium.|$|R

The agents find that while Paula's personnel file gives her age as 47, she appears no older than her mid-20's. They also discover that Paula suffered from <b>Creutzfeldt–Jakob</b> <b>disease,</b> a rare and fatal illness that causes dementia. When the agents nearly collide with a Chaco Chicken truck, they learn that the driver also suffered from the disease. Noticing the plant's blood-red runoff in a nearby stream, Mulder orders a reluctant Sheriff Arens to dredge it. They quickly find the bones of nine people, including Kearns. While inspecting the skeletal remains, the agents notice that the skeletons are all missing their skulls, and that the bones {{appear to have been}} boiled. Meanwhile, Randolph and Harold discuss the uncovered bones and increase of Creutzfeldt–Jakob cases. While Randolph complains about Chaco's inaction, Harold assures him that he will talk to Chaco.|$|E
5|$|Chapter seven, Settlement, {{concerns}} sedentism – {{the transition}} from a nomadic lifestyle to a society which remains in one place permanently – which began to rise in the Near East {{at the end of the}} Last Glacial Maximum. It required new ways of thought and social organisation; Wade thinks that an evolutionary adaptation for less aggressiveness allowed this change, noting how the skeletons of the ancestral population were less gracile than those of today. Sedentism facilitated the development of agriculture, including the cultivation and domestication of wild cereals and animals. The domestication of cattle in northern Europe and parts of Africa facilitated the spread of a genetic mutation that allowed lactose tolerance, and Wade believes this is evidence of culture and evolution interacting. The following chapter, Sociality, focuses on the common dynamics of human societies, including warfare, religion, trade, and a division of roles between the sexes. Wade theorises that these institutions have an evolutionary basis, and looks at closely related primate societies – such as those of chimpanzees and bonobos – for evidence. Wade goes on to suggest that cannibalism may have been more common in the human past by noting a common genetic adaptation that protects against <b>Creutzfeldt–Jakob</b> <b>disease,</b> which is associated with the consumption of brain.|$|E
5|$|In October 1932, Ravel {{suffered}} {{a blow to}} the head in a taxi accident. The injury was not thought serious at the time, but in a study for the British Medical Journal in 1988 the neurologist R. A. Henson concludes that it may have exacerbated an existing cerebral condition. As early as 1927 close friends had been concerned at Ravel's growing absent-mindedness, and within a year of the accident he started to experience symptoms suggesting aphasia. Before the accident he had begun work on music for a film, Don Quixote (1933), but he was unable to meet the production schedule, and Jacques Ibert wrote most of the score. Ravel completed three songs for baritone and orchestra intended for the film; they were published as Don Quichotte à Dulcinée. The manuscript orchestral score is in Ravel's hand, but Lucien Garban and Manuel Rosenthal helped in transcription. Ravel composed no more after this. The exact nature of his illness is unknown. Experts have ruled out the possibility of a tumour, and have variously suggested frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease and <b>Creutzfeldt–Jakob</b> <b>disease.</b> Though no longer able to write music or perform, Ravel remained physically and socially active until his last months. Henson notes that Ravel preserved most or all his auditory imagery and could still hear music in his head.|$|E

40|$|Amyloids are {{proteins}} which aggregate into oligomers {{and then}} fibrils that accumulate in cells. Their intramo-lecular contact sites form a characteristic zipper pattern. Although a few functional amyloids are known, the ma-jority of proteins lose their physiological function when they aggregate {{and they become}} cytotoxic for cells [1 - 5]. The exact reason for this cytotoxicity is still unclear but many studies show that intermediate oligomeric struc-tures are the main culprits. The number of amyloido-genic diseases following misfolding of a protein into the amyloid is constantly increasing and include Alzheimer’s disease (amyloid-β, tau), Parkinson’s disease (α-synuclein), type 2 diabetes (amylin), <b>Creutzfeldt-Jakob’s</b> <b>disease</b> (prio...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} amyloidogenic {{proteins}} {{is of interest}} in biochemistry because these proteins undergo conformational changes and aggregation. Both processes are largely implicated in several diseases including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s or <b>Creutzfeldt-Jakob’s</b> <b>disease.</b> These phenomena are not completely understood, either at a structural or energetical point of view. Tilted peptides are short protein fragment (11 to 19 residues) that adopt a tilted orientation when inserted into biological membranes and destabilise them. Recently, tilted peptides have been detected in two amyloidogenic proteins involved in neurodegenerative diseases; the amyloid β peptide responsible for Alzheimer’s disease, and the PrP protein that causes <b>Creutzfeldt-Jakob’s</b> <b>disease.</b> Tilted peptides could {{be responsible for the}} neurotoxic effects of these proteins. Due to their destabilising properties, they could interact directly with the membrane leading to cell death. Tilted peptides could also be involved in the transconformational process of the proteins. The aim of this work is to detect tilted fragments in other amyloidogenic proteins by molecular modelling and to study some of these peptides experimentally to evidence their lipid destabilizing properties, their structure and their toxicity. In addition, this work enable the design of an automatic method of detection for tilted peptides. Twenty-two tilted peptides from 18 different proteins have been detected among 53 amyloidogenic proteins and 7 peptides were tested experimentally. The results support the hypothesis that some tilted peptides could be involved in transconformational processes and/or cytotoxicity related to amyloidogenic proteins...|$|R
5|$|Several {{experimental}} and clinical {{studies have indicated}} that aberrations and deregulations of the UPS contribute to the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative and myodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Pick's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease, <b>Creutzfeldt–Jakob</b> <b>disease,</b> and motor neuron diseases, polyglutamine (PolyQ) diseases, Muscular dystrophies and several rare forms of neurodegenerative diseases associated with dementia. As part of the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS), the proteasome maintains cardiac protein homeostasis and thus plays a significant role in cardiac Ischemic injury, ventricular hypertrophy and Heart failure. Additionally, evidence is accumulating that the UPS plays an essential role in malignant transformation. UPS proteolysis {{plays a major role in}} responses of cancer cells to stimulatory signals that are critical for the development of cancer. Accordingly, gene expression by degradation of transcription factors, such as p53, c-Jun, c-Fos, NF-κB, c-Myc, HIF-1α, MATα2, STAT3, sterol-regulated element-binding proteins and androgen receptors are all controlled by the UPS and thus involved in the development of various malignancies. Moreover, the UPS regulates the degradation of tumor suppressor gene products such as adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) in colorectal cancer, retinoblastoma (Rb). and von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL), as well as a number of proto-oncogenes (Raf, Myc, Myb, Rel, Src, Mos, Abl). The UPS is also involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses. This activity is usually attributed to the role of proteasomes in the activation of NF-κB which further regulates the expression of pro inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-β, IL-8, adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, P selectine) and prostaglandins and nitric oxide (NO). Additionally, the UPS also plays a role in inflammatory responses as regulators of leukocyte proliferation, mainly through proteolysis of cyclines and the degradation of CDK inhibitors. Lastly, autoimmune disease patients with SLE, Sjogren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) predominantly exhibit circulating proteasomes which can be applied as clinical biomarkers.|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} amyloidogenic {{proteins}} {{is of great}} interest in biochemistry because these proteins undergo a conformational change and an aggregation, that are largely implicated in several incurable diseases including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s or <b>Creutzfeldt-Jakob’s</b> <b>disease.</b> In addition, these phenomena are not completely understood, either structurally or energetically. These proteins, in their amyloidogenic conformation, aggregate rapidly in solution and form fibrils that are insoluble and resistant to proteolysis. Recently, tilted peptides were detected {{in two of the}} amyloidogenic proteins involved in neurodegenerative diseases; the amyloid β peptide responsible for Alzheimer’s disease, and the PrP protein that causes <b>Creutzfeldt-Jakob’s</b> <b>disease.</b> Tilted peptides are short protein fragments (11 to 18 residues) that adopt a tilted orientation when inserted into biological membranes, which they are able to destabilise. When helical, tilted peptides present an asymmetric hydrophobicity gradient responsible for their oblique insertion. Tilted peptides have also been detected in some other amyloidogenic proteins. In a set of 27 amyloidogenic proteins, five tilted peptides from four different proteins have been shown up by molecular modelling. Tilted peptides could be responsible for the neurotoxic effect of these proteins. Thanks to their fusogenic properties, they could interact directly with the membrane leading to cell death. Tilted peptides could also be involved in the tranconformational process of these proteins. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterise experimentally the tilted peptide detected by molecular modelling in the α-synuclein sequence, responsible for Parkinson’s disease. This peptide is tested experimentally to highlight its lipid destabilising properties. Its conformation is studied by IR spectroscopy.

We suggest that centromere inactivation results from a modified conformation of the functional DNA sequences preventing normal binding to centromere specific proteins. We also postulate that the patient's disorder, reminiscent of a spongy glioneuronal dystrophy as seen in Alper's and <b>Creutzfeldt-Jakob</b> <b>diseases,</b> may be secondary to the presence of the pathogenic isoform of the prion protein encoded by a gene mapped to 20 p 12 [...] pter...|$|R

40|$|Amyloid fibrils are fibrillar {{polypeptide}} aggregates {{from several}} degenerative human conditions, including Alzheimer's and <b>Creutzfeldt-Jakob</b> <b>diseases.</b> Analysis of amyloid fibrils derived from various human diseases (AA, ATTR, Aβ 2 M, ALλ, and ALκ amyloidosis) shows {{that these are}} associated with a common lipid component that has a conserved chemical composition and that is specifically rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids, the major components of cellular lipid rafts. This pattern is not notably affected by the purification procedure, and no tight lipid interactions can be detected when preformed fibrils are mixed with lipids. By contrast, the early and prefibrillar aggregates formed in an AA amyloid-producing cell system interact with the raft marker ganglioside- 1, and amyloid formation is impaired by addition of cholesterol-reducing agents.

History: The first published account of allograft tympanoplasty is by Ned Chalat in 1964; however, whether {{he was the first}} to use the technique is controversial. In 1966, Jean Marquet published the first clinically successful use of allograft tympanic membranes. Since that time, a number of surgeons have trialed both en bloc tympano-ossicular techniques and tympanomeatal techniques with separate ossicle interposition or columellar reconstruction, often with considerable success. The advent of the human immunodeficiency virus and <b>Creutzfeldt-Jakob's</b> <b>disease</b> resulted in a reduction in its application; however, a number of centers are still successfully using the technique in their current practice.

40|$|Article first {{published}} online: 2 SEP 2008 This mini-review {{focuses on the}} processes and consequences of protein folding and misfolding. The latter process often leads to protein aggregation and precipitation with the aggregates adopting either highly ordered (amyloid fibril) or disordered (amorphous) forms. In particular, the amyloid fibril is discussed because this form has gained considerable notoriety due to its close links {{to a variety of}} debilitating diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and <b>Creutzfeldt-Jakob</b> <b>diseases,</b> and type-II diabetes. In each of these diseases a different protein forms fibrils, yet the fibrils formed have a very similar structure. The mechanism by which fibrils form, fibril structure, and the cytotoxicity associated with fibril formation are discussed. The generic nature of amyloid fibril structure suggests that a common target may be accessible to treat amyloid fibril-associated diseases.

40|$|Amyloid fibrils and prions are {{proteinaceous}} aggregates {{that are}} based on a unique form of polypeptide configuration, termed cross-β structure. Using a group of chemically distinct polyamino acids, we show here that the existence of such a structure does not require the presence of specific side chain interactions or sequence patterns. These observations firmly establish that amyloid formation and protein folding represent two fundamentally different ways of organizing polypeptides into ordered conformations. Protein folding depends critically on the presence of distinctive side chain sequences and produces a unique globular fold. By contrast, the properties of different polyamino acids suggest that amyloid formation arises primarily from main chain interactions that are, in some environments, overruled by specific side chain contacts. This side chain effect {{can be thought of as}} the inverse of the one that characterizes protein folding. Conditions including Alzheimer’s and <b>Creutzfeldt–Jakob</b> <b>diseases</b> represent, on this basis, pathological cases in which a natural polypeptide chain has aberrantly adopted the conformation that is primarily defined by main chain interactions and not the structure that is determined by specific side chain contacts that depend on the polypeptide sequence...|$|R
40|$|Protein {{aggregation}} {{can proceed}} via disordered or ordered mechanisms, {{with the latter}} being associated with amyloid fibril formation, which {{has been linked to}} a number of debilitating conditions including Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s, Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s and <b>Creutzfeldt-Jakob</b> <b>diseases.</b> Small heat-shock proteins (sHsps), such as alpha B-crystallin, act as chaperones to prevent protein aggregation and are thought to {{play a key role in}} the prevention of protein-misfolding diseases. In this study, we have explored the potential for small molecules such as arginine and guanidine to affect the chaperone activity of alpha B-crystallin against disordered (amorphous) and ordered (amyloid fibril) forms of protein aggregation. The effect of these additives is highly dependent upon the target protein undergoing aggregation. Importantly, our results show that the chaperone action of alpha B-crystallin against aggregation of the disease-related amyloid fibril forming protein alpha-synucleinA 53 T is enhanced in the presence of arginine and similar positively charged compounds (such as lysine and guanidine). Thus, our results suggest that target protein identity plays a critical role in governing the effect of small molecules on the chaperone action of sHsps. Significantly, small molecules that regulate the activity of sHsps may provide a mechanism to protect cells from the toxic protein aggregation that is associated with some protein-misfolding diseases...|$|R

In common with the mammalian prion protein (PrP), the N-terminal Winged-Helix (WH 1) domain of the pPS 10 plasmid replication protein (RepA) assembles in vitro {{into a variety of}} amyloid nanostructures upon binding to different specific dsDNA sequences. Here we show that di- (S 2) and tetra-sulphonated (S 4) derivatives of indigo stain dock at the DNA recognition interface in the RepA-WH 1 dimer. They compete binding of RepA to its natural target dsDNA repeats, found at the repA operator and at the origin of replication of the plasmid. Calorimetry points to the existence of a major site, with micromolar affinity, for S 4 -indigo in RepA-WH 1 dimers. As revealed by electron microscopy, in the presence of inducer dsDNA, both S 2 /S 4 stains inhibit the assembly of RepA-WH 1 into fibres. These results validate the concept that DNA can promote protein assembly into amyloids and reveal that the binding sites of effector molecules can be targeted to inhibit amyloidogenesis...|$|R
