5|$|Ganymede's surface has an albedo {{of about}} 43%. Water ice {{seems to be}} {{ubiquitous}} on its surface, with a mass fraction of 50–90 %, significantly more than in Ganymede as a whole. Near-infrared spectroscopy has revealed the presence of strong water ice absorption bands at wavelengths of 1.04, 1.25, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 μm. The grooved terrain is brighter and has a more icy composition than the dark terrain. The analysis of high-resolution, near-infrared and UV spectra obtained by the Galileo spacecraft and from Earth observations has revealed various non-water materials: carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and, possibly, <b>cyanogen,</b> hydrogen sulfate and various organic compounds. Galileo results have also shown magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) and, possibly, sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) on Ganymede's surface. These salts may originate from the subsurface ocean.|$|E
40|$|Four (Alotau, Mt. Hagen, Goroka, and Rabaul) {{types of}} mumu (earth-oven) in Papua New Guinea were {{evaluated}} to ascertain their potential to detoxify cassava.

The loss of <b>cyanogens</b> in the (coconut) creamed cassava dough was lower than in the uncreamed dough. This was more evident when coconut cream–cassava mixture was cooked in boiling water than in a conventional oven set at 180 °C. Certain interactions were suspected to exist between the coconut cream and <b>cyanogens</b> or between the coconut cream and the appropriate enzymes that are responsible for the hydrolysis of the <b>cyanogens.</b> Such interactions resisted the loss of <b>cyanogens</b> and/or their quantification by the analytical method.

50|$|Traditional {{methods of}} {{processing}} cassava to remove <b>cyanogens</b> consist of sun drying and heap fermentation in East Africa, which are inadequate in removal of <b>cyanogens</b> {{even in a}} year of normal rainfall. In Central Africa soaking (retting) of cassava roots in water for 4-5 days is adequate, but short soaking for 1-2 days leaves large amounts of <b>cyanogens</b> in flour and leads to konzo. In West Africa a roasted product called gari is produced by a different method than that used to produce flour, which reduces the total cyanide content to 10-20 ppm. There are no reported cases of konzo west of Cameroon. However another neurological disease called tropical ataxic neuropathy (TAN), occurs amongst older people in south-west Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, West Indies and South India, and is probably due to long term intake of <b>cyanogens</b> from cassava at a lower level than that needed to cause konzo.|$|R

The Institute of Forensic Medicine at the University of Berne made a statement, based on a Red Cross report, that the gas was {{likely to have been}} halogenous derivatives – phosgene, mustard gas, lewisite, chlorine or <b>cyanogen</b> bromide. The gas attacks stopped for three weeks after the Six-Day War of June, but resumed on July, against all parts of royalist Yemen.

5|$|Many {{covalent}} binary nitrides are known. Examples include <b>cyanogen</b> ((CN)2), triphosphorus pentanitride (P3N5), disulfur dinitride (S2N2), and tetrasulfur tetranitride (S4N4). The essentially covalent {{silicon nitride}} (Si3N4) and germanium nitride (Ge3N4) are also known: silicon nitride in particular {{would make a}} promising ceramic {{if not for the}} difficulty of working with and sintering it. In particular, the group 13 nitrides, most of which are promising semiconductors, are isoelectronic with graphite, diamond, and silicon carbide and have similar structures: their bonding changes from covalent to partially ionic to metallic as the group is descended. In particular, since the B–N unit is isoelectronic to C–C, and carbon is essentially intermediate in size between boron and nitrogen, much of organic chemistry finds an echo in boron–nitrogen chemistry, such as in borazine ("inorganic benzene"). Nevertheless, the analogy is not exact due to the ease of nucleophilic attack at boron due to its deficiency in electrons, which is not possible in a wholly carbon-containing ring.|$|E

40|$|Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is {{a widely}} {{consumed}} food in the tropics that naturally contains cyanogenic glycosides (<b>cyanogens,</b> mainly composed of linamarin, acetone cyanohydrin, and hydrocyanic acid). If cassava is not adequately processed to reduce the level of <b>cyanogens</b> prior to consumption, these compounds {{can lead to the}} formation of hydrocyanic acid in the gut. Exposure to hydrocyanic acid can cause symptoms ranging from vomiting and abdominal pain to coma and death. In 2008, a survey of ready-to-eat (RTE) cassava-based snack foods was undertaken to determine levels of <b>cyanogens</b> measured as total hydrocyanic acid. This survey was undertaken in response to the New South Wales Food Authority being alerted to the detection of elevated levels of <b>cyanogens</b> in an RTE cassava-based snack food. This survey took 374 samples of RTE cassava chips available in the Australian marketplace. Significant variation in the levels of total hydrocyanic acid were observed in the 317 samples testing positive for <b>cyanogens,</b> with levels ranging from 13 to 165 mg of HCN equivalents per kg (mean value, 64. 2 mg of HCN eq/kg for positive samples). The results from this survey serve as a timely warning for manufacturers of RTE cassava chips and other cassava-based snack foods to ensure there is tight control over the levels of <b>cyanogens</b> in the cassava ingredient. Evidence from this survey contributed to an amendment to the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code, which now prescribes a maximum level for hydrocyanic acid in RTE cassava chips of 10 mg of HCN eq/kg, which aligns with the Codex Alimentarius Commission international standard for edible cassava flour.

25|$|The {{disadvantages}} {{of this approach}} include the toxicity of <b>cyanogen</b> bromide and its sensitivity to oxidation.

25|$|<b>Cyanogen</b> bromide {{is often}} used to {{immobilize}} proteins by coupling them to reagents such as agarose for affinity chromatography. Because of its simplicity and mild pH conditions, <b>cyanogen</b> bromide activation is the most common method for preparing affinity gels. <b>Cyanogen</b> bromide is also often used because it reacts with the hydroxyl groups on agarose to form cyanate esters and imidocarbonates. These groups are reacted with primary amines in order to couple the protein onto the agarose matrix, as shown in the figure. Because cyanate esters are more reactive than are cyclic imidocarbonates, the amine will react mostly with the ester, yielding isourea derivatives, and partially with the less reactive imidocarbonate, yielding substituted imidocarbonates.|$|E
40|$|Many people, {{particularly}} in Africa, suffer various conditions from eating bitter cassava which contains poisonous <b>cyanogens.</b> As well as poisoning, which sometimes causes death, these conditions include konzo, an irreversible paralysis of the legs, which affects mainly {{children and young}} women, impaired neurocognition in children, tropical ataxic neuropathy in older people, and aggravation of iodine deficiency disorders (such as goitre and cretinism) in iodine deficient areas. The wetting method removes residual <b>cyanogens,</b> and is an additional method of processing cassava flour after its preparation {{by one of the}} traditional methods. The wetting method is simple and easy to use, the traditional thick porridge (fufu or ugali) made from the treated flour tastes very good, and the method is readily accepted by rural women in East and Central Africa. Regular use of the wetting method by rural women in 13 villages in the Democratic Republic of Congo has prevented konzo amongst more than 9, 000 people.

40|$|Cassava is {{the major}} root crop for a quarter billion {{subsistence}} farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. It is valued {{for its ability to}} grow in adverse environments and the food security it provides. Cassava contains potentially toxic levels of cyanogenic glycosides (linamarin) which protect the plant from herbivory and theft. The <b>cyanogens,</b> including linamarin and its deglycosylated product, acetone cyanohydrin, can be efficiently removed from the root by various processing procedures. Short-cuts in processing, which may occur during famines, can result in only partial removal of <b>cyanogens.</b> Residual <b>cyanogens</b> in cassava foods may cause neurological disorders or paralysis, particularly in nutritionally compromised individuals. To address this problem and to further understand the function of cyanogenic glycosides in cassava, we have generated transgenic cassava in which cyanogenic glycoside synthesis has been selectively inhibited in leaves and roots by antisense expression of CYP 79 D 1 /D 2 gene fragments. The CYP 79 D 1 /D 2 genes encode two highly similar cytochrome P 450 s that catalyze the first-dedicated step in cyanogenic glycoside synthesis. Transgenic plants in which the expression of these genes was selectively inhibited in leaves had substantially reduced (60 – 94 % reduction) linamarin leaf levels. Surprisingly, these plants also had a greater than a 99 % reduction in root linamarin content. In contrast, transgenic plants in which the CYP 79 D 1 /D 2 transcript...|$|R

40|$|Large {{amounts of}} cyanogenic lipids (esters of 1 cyano- 2 -methylprop- 2 -ene- 1 -ol with C: 20 fatty acids) {{are stored in}} the seeds of Ungnadia speciosa.

At the same time, cyanogenic glycosides are synthesized, but the total amount is much lower (about 26 %) than the quantity of cyanogenic lipids formerly present in the seeds. This large decrease in the total content of <b>cyanogens</b> (HCN-potential) demonstrates that at least 74 % of cyanogenic lipids are converted to noncyanogenic compounds. Whether the newly synthesized cyanogenic glycosides are derived directly from cyanogenic lipids or produced by de novo synthesis is still unknown. Based on the utilization of cyanogenic lipids for the synthesis of noncyanogenic compounds, it is concluded that these <b>cyanogens</b> serve as storage for reduced nitrogen.
