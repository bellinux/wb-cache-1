40|$|We {{determine}} the 2 -color Ramsey number of a <b>connected</b> <b>triangle</b> matching c(nK_ 3) which is any connected graph containing n vertex disjoint triangles. We obtain that R(c(nK_ 3),c(nK_ 3)) = 7 n- 2, somewhat larger {{than in the}} classical result of Burr, Erdős and Spencer for a triangle matching, R(nK_ 3,nK_ 3) = 5 n. The motivation is to {{determine the}} Ramsey number R(C_n^ 2,C_n^ 2) of the square of a cycle C_n^ 2. We apply our Ramsey result for <b>connected</b> <b>triangle</b> matchings to show that the Ramsey number of an "almost" square of a cycle C_n^ 2,c (a cycle of length n in which all but at most a constant number c of short diagonals are present) is asymptotic to 7 n/ 3.

50|$|Sweephull is {{a hybrid}} {{technique}} for 2D Delaunay triangulation {{that uses a}} radially propagating sweep-hull, and a flipping algorithm. The sweep-hull is created sequentially by iterating a radially-sorted set of 2D points, and <b>connecting</b> <b>triangles</b> to the visible part of the convex hull, which gives a non-overlapping triangulation. One can build a convex hull in this manner {{so long as the}} order of points guarantees no point would fall within the triangle. But, radially sorting should minimize flipping by being highly Delaunay to start. This is then paired with a ﬁnal iterative triangle ﬂipping step.|$|R

50|$|A {{triangle}} strip is {{a series}} of <b>connected</b> <b>triangles,</b> sharing vertices, allowing for more efficient memory usage for computer graphics. They are more efficient than triangle lists without indexing, but usually equally fast or slower than indexed triangle lists. The primary reason to use triangle strips is {{to reduce the amount of}} data needed to create a series of triangles. The number of vertices stored in memory is reduced from 3N to N+2, where N is the number of triangles to be drawn. This allows for less use of disk space, as well as making them faster to load into RAM.|$|R
50|$|A {{triangle}} fan is {{a primitive}} in 3D computer graphics that saves on {{storage and processing}} time. It describes a set of <b>connected</b> <b>triangles</b> that share one central vertex (unlike the <b>triangle</b> strip that <b>connects</b> the next vertex point to the last two used vertices to form a triangle). If N {{is the number of}} triangles in the fan, the number of vertices describing it is N+2. This is a considerable improvement over the 3N vertices that are necessary to describe the triangles separately. The graphics pipeline can take advantage by only performing the viewing transformations and lighting calculations once per vertex. Triangle fans are deprecated in Direct3D10 and later.|$|R

Experiments are performed on a full scale long-range twin aisle aircraft mock up placed in the Fraunhofer Flight Test Facility. With the tracer gas technique, it could be proven that there is a noticeable airflow path connecting crown, cockpit and bilge whereas the design airflow path that <b>connects</b> <b>triangle</b> areas with the bilge only plays a minor role...|$|R
40|$|The {{classification}} of Curtis-Tits amalgams with <b>connected,</b> <b>triangle</b> free, simply-laced diagram over {{a field of}} size at least 4 was completed in BloHof 2014 b. Orientable amalgams are those arising from applying the Curtis-Tits theorem to groups of Kac-Moody type, and indeed, their universal completions are central extensions of those groups of Kac-Moody type. The paper BloHof 2014 a exhibits concrete (matrix) groups as completions for all Curtis-Tits amalgams with diagram A_n- 1. For non-orientable amalgams these groups are symmetry groups of certain unitary forms over a ring of skew Laurent polynomials. In the present paper we generalize this to all amalgams arising from the classification above and, under some additional conditions, exhibit their universal completions as central extensions of twisted groups of Kac-Moody type...|$|R

40|$|AbstractErdös and Moser {{raised the}} problem of {{determining}} {{the largest number of}} maximal independent sets of a general graph G of order n and those graphs achieving this largest number. This problem was solved by Erdös, and later Moon and Moser. It then was extensively studied for various classes of graphs, including trees, forests, (connected) graphs with at most one cycle, bipartite graphs, connected graphs, k-connected graphs and triangle-free graphs. This paper studies the problem for connected triangle-free graphs. In particular, we prove that every <b>connected</b> <b>triangle,</b> free graph of order n ⩾ 22 has at most 5 · 2 (n− 6) / 2 (respectively, 2 (n− 1) / 2) maximal independent sets if n is even (respectively, odd).

The analysis is focused on the effects of payoffs and noise (temperature) on the maintenance of cooperation. When varying the noise level and/or the highest payoff, the system exhibits a second order phase transition from a mixed state of cooperators and defectors to an absorbing state where only defectors remain alive. For the random regular graph (and Bethe lattice) the behavior of the system is similar to those found previously on the square lattice with nearest neighbor interactions, although the measure of cooperation is enhanced by the absence of loops in the connectivity structure. For low noises the optimal connectivity structure is built up from randomly <b>connected</b> <b>triangles...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Surface {{triangle}} meshes {{and volume}} data are two commonly used representations of digital geometry. Converting from triangle meshes to volume data is challenging, since triangle meshes often contain defects such as small holes, internal structures, or self-intersections. In the extreme case, {{we may be}} simply presented {{with a set of}} arbitrarily <b>connected</b> <b>triangles,</b> a “triangle soup”. This paper presents a novel method to generate volume data represented as an octree from a general 3 D triangle soup. Our motivation is the Faraday cage from electrostatics. We consider the input triangles as forming an approximately closed Faraday cage, and set its potential to zero. We then introduce a second conductor surrounding it, and give it a higher constant potential. Due to the electrostatic shielding effect, the resulting electric field approximately lies in that part of space outside the shape implicitly determined by the triangle soup. Unlike previous approaches, our metho...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a robust {{isotropic}} tetrahedral mesh generation method. An advancing front method is employed to control local mesh density and to easily preserve the original connectivity of boundary surfaces. Tetrahedra {{are created by}} each layer. Instead of preparing a background mesh for mesh spacing control, this information is estimated {{at the beginning of}} each layer at each node from the area of <b>connecting</b> <b>triangles</b> on the front and a user-specified stretching factor. An alternating digital tree (ADT) is prepared to correct the mesh spacing information and to perform geometric search efficiently. At the end of the mesh generation process, angle-based smoothing and Delaunay refinement are employed to enhance the resulting mesh quality. Surface meshes are prepared beforehand using a direct advancing front method for discrete surfaces extracted from computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. The algorithm is demonstrated with several biomedical models...|$|R

40|$|Copy-move forgery {{is one of}} {{the most}} common types of {{tampering}} for digital images. Detection methods generally use block-matching approaches, which first divide the image into overlapping blocks and then extract and compare features to find similar ones, or point-based approaches, in which relevant keypoints are extracted and matched to each other to find similar areas. In this paper, we present a very novel hybrid approach, which compares triangles rather than blocks, or single points. Interest points are extracted from the image, and objects are modeled as a set of <b>connected</b> <b>triangles</b> built onto these points. Triangles are matched according to their shapes (inner angles), their content (color information), and the local feature vectors extracted onto the vertices of the triangles. Our methods are designed to be robust to geometric transformations. Results are compared with a state-of-the-art block matching method and a point-based method. Furthermore, our data set is available for use by academic researchers...|$|R

The surfaces depict a value of equal density (an isosurface) or display the surrounds of specied objects within the data.

These surfaces (or contours) are often formed from a set of <b>connected</b> <b>triangles</b> (or lines). These piecewise segments represent the simplest non-degenerate object of that dimension and are named simplices. In four dimensions a simplex is represented by a tetrahedron, which is also known as a 3 -simplex.
