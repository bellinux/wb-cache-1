A cry of wonder and of admiration burst from Robert McIntyre, as his eyes rested upon case after case filled with the most {{magnificent}} stones. The deep still red of the rubies, the clear scintillating green of the emeralds, the hard glitter of the diamonds, the many shifting shades of beryls, of amethysts, of onyxes, of cats'-eyes, of opals, of agates, of <b>cornelians</b> seemed to fill the whole chamber with a vague twinkling, many-coloured light. Long slabs of the beautiful blue lapis lazuli, magnificent bloodstones, specimens of pink and red and white coral, long strings of lustrous pearls, all these were tossed out by their owner as a careless schoolboy might pour marbles from his bag.|$|R

25|$|The {{history of}} Awka-Etiti before 1900 is not {{recorded}} in writing but rather rooted in oral tradition and mythology. Based {{on the discovery}} and archaeological excavation of sites dated to the first millennium AD in Igbo-Ukwu just 2km from Awka-Etiti, {{it is certain that}} the area has been populated by the Igbo earlier than the ninth century. There existed a flourishing metallurgical industry (see Archaeology of Igbo-Ukwu) as well as an ancient and extensive trade, social and cultural contact between the area and ancient Egypt as revealed by the vast amounts of glass and <b>cornelian</b> beads excavated at the sites, some of which were manufactured in Old Cairo at the workshops of Fustat.|$|E
60|$|In a {{geographical}} {{point of view}} the range of hills between Burdwan and the Soave is interesting, as being the north-east continuation of a chain which crosses the broadest part of the peninsula of India, from the Gulf of Cambay to the junction of the Ganges and Hoogly at Rajmahal. This range runs south of the Soane and Kymore, which it meets I believe at Omerkuntuk;* [A lofty mountain said to be 7000-8000 feet high.] the granite of this and the sandstone of the other, being there both overlaid with trap. Further west again, the ranges separate, the southern still betraying a nucleus of granite, forming the Satpur range, which divides {{the valley of the}} Taptee from that of the Nerbudda. The Paras-nath range is, though the most difficult of definition, the longer of the two parallel ranges; the Vindhya continued as the Kymore, terminating abruptly at the Fort of Chunar on the Ganges. The general and geological features of the two, especially along their eastern course, are very different. This consists of metamorphic gneiss, in various highly inclined beds, through which granite hills protrude, the loftiest of which is Paras-nath. The north-east Vindhya (called Kymore), on the other hand, consists of nearly horizontal beds of sandstone, overlying inclined beds of non-fossiliferous limestone. Between the latter and the Paras-nath gneiss, come (in order of superposition) shivered and undulating strata of metamorphic quartz, hornstone, hornstone- porphyry, jaspers, etc. These are thrown up, by greenstone I believe, along the north and north-west boundary of the gneiss range, and are to be recognised as forming the rocks of Colgong, of Sultangunj, and of Monghyr, on the Ganges, as also various detached hills near Gyah, and along the upper course of the Soane. From these are derived the beautiful agates and <b>cornelians,</b> so famous under the name of Soane pebbles, and they are equally common on the Curruckpore range, as on the south bank of the Soane, so much so in the former position as to have been used in the decoration of the walls of the now ruined palaces near Bhagulpore.|$|R
60|$|These {{being what}} we have usually to deal with, Nature seems to have set herself to make these three {{substances}} as interesting to us, and as beautiful for us, as she can. The clay, being a soft and changeable substance, she doesn't take much pains about, as we have seen, till it is baked; she brings the colour into it only when it receives a permanent form. But the limestone and flint she paints, in her own way, in their native state: and her object in painting them seems to be {{much the same as}} in her painting of flowers; to draw us, careless and idle human creatures, to watch her a little, and see what she is about--that being on the whole good for us,--her children. For Nature is always carrying on very strange work with this limestone and flint of hers: laying down beds of them {{at the bottom of the}} sea; building islands out of the sea; filling chinks and veins in mountains with curious treasures; petrifying mosses, and trees, and shells; in fact, carrying on all sorts of business, subterranean or submarine, which it would be highly desirable for us, who profit and live by it, to notice as it goes on. And apparently to lead us to do this, she makes picture-books for us of limestone and flint; and tempts us, like foolish children as we are, to read her books by the pretty colours in them. The pretty colours in her limestone-books form those variegated marbles which all mankind have taken delight to polish and build with from the beginning of time; and the pretty colours in her flint-books form those agates, jaspers, <b>cornelians,</b> bloodstones, onyxes, cairngorms, chrysoprases, which men have in like manner taken delight to cut, and polish, and make ornaments of, from the beginning of time; and yet, so much of babies are they, and so fond of looking at the pictures instead of reading the book, that I question whether, after six thousand years of cutting and polishing, there are above two or three people out of any given hundred, who know, or care to know, how a bit of agate or a bit of marble was made, or painted.|$|R
6000|$|No {{sooner had}} {{he walked to}} the city wall than the monkeys pulled him back, telling him {{that he did not know}} how happy he was, and {{pinching}} him to make him grateful. He set his teeth and said nothing, but went with the shouting monkeys to a terrace above the red sandstone reservoirs that were half-full of rain water. There was a ruined summer-house of white marble in the center of the terrace, built for queens dead a hundred years ago. The domed roof had half fallen in and blocked up the underground passage from the palace by which the queens used to enter. But the walls were made of screens of marble tracery--beautiful milk-white fretwork, set with agates and <b>cornelians</b> and jasper and lapis lazuli, and as the moon came up behind the hill it shone through the open work, casting shadows on the ground like black velvet embroidery. Sore, sleepy, and hungry as he was, Mowgli could not help laughing when the Bandar-log began, twenty at a time, to tell him how great and wise and strong and gentle they were, and how foolish he was to wish to leave them.

[...] "Now as you are a new listener and can carry our words back to the Jungle-People so that they may notice us in future, we will tell you all about our most excellent selves." [...] Mowgli made no objection, and the monkeys gathered by hundreds and hundreds on the terrace to listen to their own speakers singing the praises of the Bandar-log, and whenever a speaker stopped for want of breath they would all shout together: [...] "This is true; we all say so." [...] Mowgli nodded and blinked, and said [...] "Yes" [...] when they asked him a question, and his head spun with the noise. [...] "Tabaqui the Jackal must have bitten all these people," [...] he said to himself, [...] "and now they have madness. Certainly this is dewanee, the madness. Do they never go to sleep? Now there is a cloud coming to cover that moon. If it were only a big enough cloud I might try to run away in the darkness. But I am tired." ...|$|R

6000|$|... [FN#1] It is curious, as Crichton (Arabia, vol. ii. p. 208) observes, that Gibbon {{seems not}} to have seen or known {{anything}} of the little work published by Pitts on his return home. It is entitled “A faithful Account of the Religion and the Manners of the Mahometans, in which is a particular Relation of their Pilgrimage to Mecca, the Place of Mahomet’s Birth, and Description of Medina, and of his Tomb there,” &c., &c. My copy is the 4th edition, printed for T. Longman and R. Hett, London, A.D. 1708. The only remarkable feature in the “getting up” of the little octavo is, that the engraving headed “the most sacred and antient Temple of the Mahometans at Mecca,” is the reverse of the impression[.] [FN#2] Some years afterwards, Mr. Consul Baker, when waited upon by Pitts, in London, gave him a copy of the letter, with the following memorandum upon the back of it—“Copy of my letter to Consul Raye at Smyrna, to favour the escape of Joseph Pitts, an English renegade, from a squadron of Algier men-of-war. Had my kindness to him been discovered by the government of Algiers, my legs and arms had first been broken, and my carcass burnt—a danger hitherto not courted by any.” [FN#3] The italics in the text are the author’s. This is admirably characteristic of the man. Asiatic Christendom would not satisfy him. He seems to hate the “damnable doctrines” of the “Papists,” almost as much as those of the Moslems. [FN#4] He must have been accustomed to long days’ journeys. Al-Idrisi makes Jeddah forty miles from Meccah; I calculated about forty-four. [FN#5] Dalil, a guide, generally called at Meccah “Muttawwif.” [FN#6] Pitts’ Note,—that before they’ll provide for themselves, they serve God in their way. [FN#7] Abdast is the Turkish word, borrowed from the Persian, for “Wuzu,” the minor ablution. [FN#8] Ruka’at, a bending. This two-bow prayer is in honour of the Mosque. [FN#9] This is the ceremony technically called Al-Sai, or running between Safa and Marwah. Burckhardt describes it accurately, vol. i. pp. 174, 175. [FN#10] Ihram, the pilgrim-garb. [FN#11] Now gold or gilt. [FN#12] This is an error. The stone is called Hajar Aswad, the Black Stone, or Hajar As’ad, the Blessed Stone. Moreover, it did not change its colour on account of the sins of the people who kissed it. [FN#13] The Meccans, in effect, still make this a boast. [FN#14] Nothing more blindly prejudiced than this statement. Moslems turn towards Meccah, as Christians towards Jerusalem. [FN#15] As will afterwards be explained, all the four orthodox schools do not think it necessary to kiss the stone after each circumambulation. [FN#16] These are mere local traditions. The original Ka’abah was composed of materials gathered from the six mountains of Paradise (chap. xx.) The present building is of grey granite quarried in a hill near Meccah. [FN#17] Now Jabal Nur. [FN#18] They come from the well-known Taif, which the country people call Hijaz, but never Habbash. The word Taif literally means the “circumambulator.” It is said that when Adam settled at Meccah, finding the country barren, he prayed to Allah to supply him with a bit of fertile land. Immediately appeared a mountain, which having performed Tawaf round the Ka’abah, settled itself down eastward of Meccah. Hence, to the present day, Taif is called Kita min al-Sham, a piece of Syria, its fatherland. [FN#19] This is an error of printing for “paces.” [FN#20] (Pitts’ Note.) Not of massy gold, as a late French author (who, I am sure, was never there) says. The door is of wood, only plated over with silver; much less is the inside of the Beat ceiled with massy gold, as the same Frenchman asserts. I can assure the world it is no such thing. The door is of wood, thickly plated over with silver, in many parts gilt. And whatever hereabouts is gilt, the Meccans always call gold. (R.F.B.) [FN#21] This is no longer the case. Few women ever enter the Ka’abah, on account of the personal danger they run there. [FN#22] More correctly, at three of the corners, and the fourth opposite the southern third of the western wall. [FN#23] It is deemed disrespectful to look at the ceiling, but pilgrims may turn their eyes in any other direction they please. [FN#24] There are now three. [FN#25] It is tucked up about six feet high. [FN#26] It is a close kind of grey granite, which takes a high polish from the pilgrims’ feet. [FN#27] Now iron posts. [FN#28] The Shafe’i school have not, and never had, a peculiar oratory like the other three schools. They pray near the well Zemzem. [FN#29] This place contains the stone which served Abraham for a scaffold when he was erecting the Ka’abah. Some of our popular writers confound this stone with the Hajar al-Aswad. [FN#30] (Pitts’ Note.) The worthy Mons. Thevenot saith, that the waters of Meccah are bitter; but I never found them so, but as sweet and as good as any others, for aught as I could perceive. Pitts has just remarked that he found the waters of Zemzem brackish. To my taste it was a salt-bitter, which was exceedingly disagreeable. (R.F.B.) [FN#31] They are not so modest. 600,000 is the mystical number; others declare it to be incalculable. Oftentimes 70,000 have met at Arafat. [FN#32] The cupola has now disappeared; there is a tall pillar of masonry-work, whitewashed, rising from a plastered floor, for praying. [FN#33] On the 9th Zu’l Hijjah, or the Day of Arafat, the pilgrims, having taken their stations within the sacred limits, perform ablution about noon, and pray as directed at that hour. At three P.M., after again performing the usual devotions, or more frequently after neglecting them, they repair to the hill, and hear the sermon. [FN#34] At Muzdalifah. [FN#35] This, I need scarcely say, is speaking as a Christian. All Moslems believe that Ishmael, and not Isaac, was ordered to be sacrificed. The place to which Pitts alludes is still shown to pilgrims. [FN#36] (Pitts’ Note.) Monsieur de Thevenot saith, that they throw these stones at the Gibbel or Mount; but, indeed, it is otherwise; though I must needs say, he is very exact in almost every thing of Turkish matters; and I pay much deference to that great author. [FN#37] The Rami or Jaculator now usually says, as he casts each stone, “In the name of Allah, and Allah is omnipotent (Raghman li’sh’ Shaytani wa Khizyatih), in token of abhorrence to Satan, and for his ignominy (I do this).” [FN#38] The Arabic would mean stone the devil and slay him, unless “wazbehe” be an error for “wa ashabih,”—“and his companions.” [FN#39] Even in the present day, men who have led “wild” lives in their youth, often date their reformation from the first pilgrimage. [FN#40] Al-Yaman, Southern Arabia, whose “Akik,” or <b>cornelians</b> were celebrated. [FN#41] This is still practised in Moslem countries, being considered a decent way of begging during public prayers, without interrupting them. [FN#42] These people will contract to board the pilgrim, and to provide him with a tent, as well as to convey his luggage. [FN#43] The usual way now is in “Kitar,” or in Indian file, each camel’s halter being tied to the tail of the beast that precedes him. Pitts’ “cottor” must be a kitar, but he uses the word in another of its numerous senses. [FN#44] This vehicle is the “Takht-rawan” of Arabia. [FN#45] He describes the Mashals still in use. Lane has sketched them, Mod. Egypt. chap. vi. [FN#46] Pitts means by “imaginary Abdes,” the sand ablution,—lawful when water is wanted for sustaining life. [FN#47] As I shall explain at a future time, there are still some Hijazi Badawin whose young men, before entering life, risk everything in order to plunder a Haji. They care little for the value of the article stolen, the exploit consists in stealing it. [FN#48] The walls, therefore, were built between A.D. 1503 and A.D. 1680. [FN#49] These are not windows, but simply the inter-columnar spaces filled with grating. [FN#50] This account is perfectly correct. The Eunuchs, however, do not go into the tomb; they only light the lamps in, and sweep the passage round, the Sepulchre. [FN#51] These are the small apertures in the Southern grating. See Chap. xvi. [FN#52] The Caravan must have been near the harbour of Muwaylah, where supplies are abundant.|$|R

2500|$|He {{spent his}} time with Long, and the two would swim, ride, read, and talk with each other. However, they shared a fear of {{becoming}} overweight, and this {{marked the beginning of}} Byron's [...] "Thinning Campaign". Long was not Byron's only companion during this time; he had a short-lived friendship with John Edleston, a fifteen-year-old choirboy. About his [...] "protégé" [...] he wrote, [...] "He has been my almost constant associate since October, 1805. His voice first attracted my attention, his countenance fixed it, and his manners attached me to him for ever."

[...] A simultaneous attack was carried out in the western side, at the Mausoleum of Hadrian and the <b>Cornelian</b> Gate. There the fighting was particularly fierce. Eventually, after a hard fight, the Goths were driven off, but the situation at the Vivarium was grave. The defenders, under Bessas and Peranius, were being hard pressed, and sent to Belisarius for help. Belisarius came, accompanied by a few of his bucellarii. As soon as the Goths breached the wall, he ordered a few soldiers to attack them before they could form up, but with the majority of his troops, he sallied forth from the gate. Taking the Goths by surprise, his men pushed them back and burned their siege engines. At the same time, whether by chance or design, the Romans at the Salarian Gate also attempted a sortie, and likewise succeeded in destroying many of the siege engines. The first attempt of the Goths to storm the city had failed, and their army withdrew to their camps.|$|E

6000|$|... "Were {{you at the}} Shalem House dance last night?" [...] asked <b>Cornelian,</b> by way of {{explaining}} his air of complacent retrospection.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush!" [...] exclaimed <b>Cornelian</b> nervously. [...] "You don't {{know who}} may overhear {{you in a}} place like this. You'll get {{yourself}} into trouble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The last {{event of}} the season," [...] said <b>Cornelian,</b> [...] "and quite {{one of the most}} amusing and lively {{functions}} that there have been." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This <b>cornelian</b> must be {{something}} very precious," [...] thought he, [...] "or my wife would not wear it on her person with so much care." ...|$|E
6000|$|The <b>cornelian</b> heart was, of course, returned, and Lord Byron, at {{the same}} time, {{reminded}} that he had left it with Miss Pigot as a deposit, not a gift (Moore).] ...|$|E

60|$|<b>Cornelian</b> {{was proof}} against these shafts; leaning back {{gracefully}} {{in his chair}} he launched forth into that detailed description of his last night's attire which the Dawn had so unaccountably failed to supply.|$|E

6000|$|... "Isn't that {{exactly what}} one would have {{expected}} Pitherby to do?"

He had an uninspiring- looking woman with him, supposed to represent Military Genius." ...|$|E

60|$|The gem {{published}} for {{the first}} time on the title-page is a red <b>cornelian</b> in the British Museum, probably Graeco-Roman, and treated in an archaistic style.

6000|$|... "The best {{description}} I {{can give}} of it," [...] said <b>Cornelian,</b> [...] "is {{summed up in}} the comment of the Grafin von Tolb when she saw it being danced: 'if they really love each other I suppose it doesn't matter.'
