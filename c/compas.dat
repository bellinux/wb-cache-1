40|$|Monoacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 (MGAT 2) catalyzes the {{synthesis}} of diacylglycerol (DG), a triacylglycerol precursor and potential peripheral target for novel anti-obesity therapeutics. High-throughput screening identified lead compounds with MGAT 2 inhibitory activity. Through structural modification, a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable MGAT 2 inhibitor, compound A (<b>compA),</b> was discovered. <b>CompA</b> dose-dependently inhibited postprandial increases in plasma triglyceride (TG) levels. Metabolic flux analysis revealed that <b>compA</b> inhibited triglyceride/diacylglycerol resynthesis in the small intestine and increased free fatty acid and acyl-carnitine with shorter acyl chains than originally labelled fatty acid. <b>CompA</b> decreased high-fat diet (HFD) intake in C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. MGAT 2 -null mice showed a similar phenotype as compA-treated mice and <b>compA</b> did not suppress a food intake in MGAT 2 KO mice, indicating that the anorectic effects were dependent on MGAT 2 inhibition. Chronic administration of <b>compA</b> significantly prevented body weight gain and fat accumulation in mice fed HFD. MGAT 2 inhibition by <b>CompA</b> under severe diabetes ameliorated hyperglycemia and fatty liver in HFD-streptozotocin (STZ) -treated mice. Homeostatic model assessments (HOMA-IR) revealed that <b>compA</b> treatment significantly improved insulin sensitivity. The proximal half of the small intestine displayed weight gain following <b>compA</b> treatment. A similar phenomenon has been observed in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass-treated animals and some studies have reported that this intestinal remodeling {{is essential to the}} anti-diabetic effects of bariatric surgery. These results clearly demonstrated that MGAT 2 inhibition improved dyslipidemia, obesity, and diabetes, suggesting that <b>compA</b> is an effective therapeutic for obesity-related metabolic disorders...|$|R
40|$|The <b>COMPA</b> (Control, Orchestration, Management, Policy, and Analytics) {{adaptive}} control loop realizes an automation pattern that can operate recursively at many layers in a carrier network. An overall <b>COMPA</b> autonomic control loop can orchestrate functions, themselves implemented as <b>COMPA</b> autonomic loops. Thus the <b>COMPA</b> automation patter can recurse {{right down to}} resource level in a network. One {{of the most exciting}} application areas for the <b>COMPA</b> automation pattern is in assuring mobile network security. The recursive nature of the pattern is the ideal mechanism for automating monitoring and root cause analysis of security threats to networks. In this paper we present a Proof of Concept of a <b>COMPA</b> compliant system for a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) scenario. The system monitors, performs root cause analysis, and mitigates a DDoS attack. The system was built by integrating a number of existing components that were deployed as VNFs. Our experiences of using the system were that the system could handle a DDoS attack quickly and automatically. In addition, the system was very flexible to build and deploy...|$|R

40|$|IntroductionPromotoras, Hispanic {{community}} health workers, are frequently employed to promote health behavioral change with culturally bound Hispanic lifestyle behaviors. Peer health mentors {{have been used}} in schools to promote healthy nutrition and physical activity behaviors among students. This study investigates the efficacy of combining these 2 approaches by training high school health mentors, called <b>compa</b> 1 eros, to engage Hispanic middle school students in a school-based obesity intervention as a strategy to promote and sustain reductions in standardized body mass index (zBMI). MethodsHigh school <b>compa</b> 1 eros were trained to participate in a 6 -month obesity program alongside middle school students in Houston, Texas. Middle school students were randomized to participate in the program either with <b>compa</b> 1 eros (n = 94) or without <b>compa</b> 1 eros (n = 95). The intervention was conducted from 2013 through 2016 in 3 cohorts of students, 1 each school year. Students were followed for 12 months. The primary outcome was zBMI, which was analyzed at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. ResultsSignificant differences were found between conditions across time (F = 4. 58, P =. 01). After the 6 -month intervention, students in the condition with <b>compa</b> 1 eros had a larger decrease in zBMI (F = 6. 94, P =. 01) than students in the condition without <b>compa</b> 1 eros. Furthermore, students who received the intervention with <b>compa</b> 1 eros showed greater sustained results at 12 months (F = 7. 65, P =. 01). ConclusionUsing high school <b>compa</b> 1 eros in an obesity intervention for Hispanic middle school students could be effective in promoting and maintaining reductions in zBMI. 29023233 PMC 564519...|$|R

5|$|Exile One, {{based in}} Guadeloupe, {{is a leading}} Dominican kadans group of the 1970s that was very {{influential}} {{in the development of}} caribbean music. The full-horn section kadans band Exile One led by Gordon Henderson was the first to introduce the newly arrived synthesizers to their music that other young cadence or <b>compas</b> bands from Dominica, Haiti (mini-jazz) and the French Antilles emulated in the 1970s. Exile One was the most promoted creole band of the Caribbean. The first to sign a production contract with major label Barclay Records.

5|$|The {{inspiration}} for Zouk's style of rhythmic music {{comes from the}} Haitian <b>compas,</b> as well as music called cadence-lypso - Dominica cadence popularized by Grammacks and Exile One. Elements of gwo ka, tambour, ti bwa and biguine vidé are prominent in zouk. Though there are many diverse styles of zouk, some commonalities exist. The French Creole tongue of Martinique and Guadeloupe is an important element, and are a distinctive part of the music. Generally, zouk emphasises star singers, with little attention given to instrumentalists, and performances consist almost entirely of studio recordings.|$|E

5|$|Though zouk is {{the most}} {{well-known}} form of modern French Antillean music, the island of Martinique has also produced the chouval bwa and biguine styles, which were especially popular in the early 20th century. Chouval bwa is includes multiple distinctive instruments and internationally famous performers like Claude Germany, Dede Saint-Prix, Pakatak and Tumpak, while biguine has achieved international fame since the 1920s and has since been modernized and adapted for pop audiences, making it {{a major influence on}} zouk. Between the 1930s and 1950s, the dance biguine was popular among the islands' dance orchestras. The biguine uses a cinquillo variant related to that found in other Caribbean genres like méringue and <b>Compas.</b> In the 1940s and 1950s, these dance bands absorbed influences from Cuban, American and Haitian popular music.|$|E
25|$|The <b>compás</b> is {{fundamental}} to flamenco. <b>Compás</b> is most often translated as rhythm but it demands far more precise interpretation than any other Western style of music. If there is no guitarist available, the <b>compás</b> is rendered through hand clapping (palmas) or by hitting a table with the knuckles. The guitarist uses techniques like strumming (rasgueado) or tapping the soundboard (golpe). Changes of chords emphasize the most important downbeats.|$|E
25|$|<b>Compas</b> (konpa) (also {{known as}} <b>compas</b> direct in French, or konpa dirèk in creole) is a complex, ever-changing music that arose from African rhythms and European ballroom dancing, mixed with Haiti's bourgeois culture.
