The sulfur was transported down first with llamas, later through an aerial <b>cableway</b> <b>system</b> and finally by trucks. The sulfur was then transported to Chuquicamata {{to be converted}} into sulfuric acid. The mine was active from 1950 to 1992. The last reported mining activity on the mountain was in 1994.

2500|$|Actual {{construction}} {{started in}} December 1926, with Albert E. Paddock as project superintendent and Ralph Lowry as construction engineer.

40|$|The <b>cableway</b> {{transport}} <b>system</b> is {{very important}} for the Slovenian tourist economy. Within the Slovene transport <b>system,</b> the <b>cableway</b> transport subsystem has a specific role because it allows and ensures access to regions which are difficult to access or completely inaccessible by other transport subsystems owing to the configuration of the area. The quality and development of transport services are directly linked to the introduction of new cableways. New technical achievements, which are nowadays used in cableways, all provide greater capacity and higher speed of cableways, which, however, results in their higher maintenance and exploitation costs. The <b>cableway</b> transport <b>system</b> is being developed in Slovenia, but not on principles of sustainable development. This paper presents a model of sustainable growth and development of the <b>cableway</b> transport <b>system</b> in Slovenia based on which it is possible to determine assumptions for future growth so that the Slovene <b>cableway</b> transport <b>system</b> would approach standards of such highly developed systems. The new model includes ten essential elements of this system for which growth rates were calculated...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the reliability of}} the operation of <b>cableway</b> <b>systems</b> in Slovenia, which has major impact on the quality of service in the mountain tourism, mainly in wintertime. Different types of cableway installations in Slovenia were captured in a sample and fault tree analysis (FTA) was {{made on the basis of}} the obtained data. The paper presents the results of the analysis. With these results it is possible to determine the probability of faults of different types of cableways, which types of faults have the greatest impact on the termination of operation, which components of cableways fail most, what is the impact of age of cableways on the occurrence of the faults. Finally, an attempt was made to find if occurrence of faults on individual cableway installation has also impact on traffic on this cableway due to reduced quality of service.

5000|$|Cable {{skiing is}} very popular in Europe and slowly gaining {{momentum}} in the United States. In Germany alone there are over 70 active cableways plus 15 two mast cableways. Two mast cable systems also called linear cable systems [...] are gaining popularity world-wide with numerous systems across the US and Europe with prices for systems ranging from 8,000 to 35,000 USD. One spot in Germany, Langenfeld, has four <b>cableway</b> <b>systems</b> and the highest water skiing and wakeboarding capacity in the world. Since the sport has been growing very fast recently, there are currently more than 40 cables in Poland - Margonin (960 m), Szczecinek (1100 m), Ostróda (800 m), Lublin (760 m) and Augustów (740 m). In the U.S. there are around 50 cableways.

Events of interest are often dynamic and may not tolerate the introduction of a conventional infrastructure without disrupting the environment being monitored.

A mechanical 2 D model of the system has been developed to represent its behaviour over time, without external controllers. Subsequently, an induction machine with variable frequency drive has been considered to obtain a smooth and adjustable profile of the active power exchanged with the main network. Electrical simulations on a realistic case study confirm the effectiveness of the proposed CSS system in providing ancillary services to the network, with a very fast electrical response...|$|R

5000|$|While {{clearing}} and preparations at the dam site were underway {{as early as}} June 1965, actual construction did not begin until early 1966 with the excavation of a 40 ft diameter diversion tunnel {{and the creation of}} a 110 ft high cofferdam to divert the river around the dam site. Excavation of keyways in the canyon walls to provide future foundations for the concrete commenced in 1966 and continued through 1968. The first bucket of concrete was placed in early 1968, and by May 28, 1969, more than [...] had been poured in the dam. Concrete placement was accomplished by a <b>cableway</b> <b>system</b> supported by three movable towers on the canyon rims, transporting buckets that each had a capacity of [...] of wet concrete. The diversion tunnel was closed on September 27, 1971, allowing the reservoir to begin filling. The last concrete was poured on the dam crest on January 27, 1973. Three generating units of the power plant were also installed in 1973, and by March 1, the reservoir had risen to a sufficient level to allow power generation to begin. The reservoir first reached full capacity [...] on July 3, 1973.|$|E
40|$|A {{hand-operated}} cableway with {{a traveling}} block {{system has been}} used on the Nez Perce National Forest in Idaho since 1977. The installation allows hydrographers to safely collect streamflow and sediment data during high flow conditions when wading measurements are impractical or extremely dangerous. Because it is operated from the bank, the <b>cableway</b> <b>system</b> provides a safe, low-cost, and effective method to acquire streamflow and sediment data year-round. The hand-operated cableway is a safe alternative to manned cable cars at sites not easily gaged by boat or bridges during high flows. Cable measurements are performed whenever the stream or river to be gaged has flows that make gaging via the wading method impossible, impractical, or unsafe. The general rule is to avoid wading in the water any time the product of velocity (feet per second) {{and the depth of}} the water (in feet) exceeds 10. Temporary bridges and platforms are one alternative for reducing the risk of accidents and to avoid endangering hydrographers during high flow conditions. Platforms, however, are generally limited to relatively small streams. This <b>cableway</b> <b>system</b> offers distinct advantages over the use of temporary bridges because it can span medium-sized streams up to 100 feet wide. This <b>cableway</b> <b>system</b> is generally limited to streams less than 100 feet wide. The sounding reel cable length limits the operating width. Present installations on the Nez Perce Forest are typically on 50 - 60 feet wide streams. Peak flow measurements have been made of discharges approaching 1, 000 cfs and velocities as high as 9. 2 feet per second...|$|E
40|$|Research Station. 36 p. Streams often {{present a}} {{challenge}} for collecting flow and sediment measurements on a year-round basis. Streams that can normally be waded become hazardous during seasonal flows, either endangering hydrographers or precluding data collection completely. A hand-operated cableway permits the accurate and safe collection of discharge and sediment data from the stream bank. This system provides a low-cost, safe alternative to cable cars or operation from bridges during high runoff.

40|$|Abstract The <b>cableway</b> <b>system</b> is {{a common}} problem that is {{discussed}} in this paper. A descriptive method is used to answer the problem. The data is collected through literary studies, surveys, and interviews. The cableway is a mining transportation in the Cikotok Gold Mine. This facility was built simultaneously {{with the construction of}} the Gold Mining and ore processing plant, which was between 1936 and 1939. This lorry transported minerals from mining centers, namely Cirotan and Cikotok, to the processing plant in Pasir gombong. The results showed that the cableways were not functioned as the termination of activity in the Cikotok Gold Mine. The remaining of cableways that still there is the foundation structure of the Cirotan Station and Cikotok station buildings, and the pillars are used as SUTT PLN’s poles. The existence of the cableway for transportation of mining products is a human adaptation to the environment.   Keywords: cableway, mining transportation, ore...|$|E
