5|$|<b>Crossbow</b> and repeating crossbow: According to British art {{historian}} Matthew Landruss and Gerald Hurley, Chinese crossbows {{may have been}} invented {{as far back as}} 2000 BC, while Anne McCants speculates that they existed around 1200 BC. In China bronze <b>crossbow</b> bolts dating as early as the mid 5th century BC were found at a State of Chu burial site in Yutaishan, Hubei. The earliest handheld <b>crossbow</b> stocks with bronze trigger, dating from the 6th century BC, comes from Tomb 3 and 12 found at Qufu, Shandong, capital of the State of Lu. Other early finds of crossbows were discovered in Tomb 138 at Saobatang, Hunan dated to the mid 4th century BC. Repeating crossbows, first mentioned in the Records of the Three Kingdoms, were discovered in 1986 in Tomb 47 at Qinjiazui, Hubei dated to around the 4th century BC. The earliest textual evidence of the handheld <b>crossbow</b> used in battle dates to the 4th century BC. Handheld crossbows with complex bronze trigger mechanisms have also been found with the Terracotta Army in the tomb of Qin Shihuang (r. 221–210 BC) that are similar to specimens from the subsequent Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD), while crossbowmen described in the Han Dynasty learned drill formations, some were even mounted as cavalry units, and Han dynasty writers attributed the success of numerous battles against the Xiongnu to massed <b>crossbow</b> fire. In comparison, the ancient Greeks also had a <b>crossbow</b> known as the gastraphetes ("belly-bow", so named because the shooter had to draw the bow by pressing his stomach against the concave rear) also invented in the 5th century BC; other versions were the more portable Cheirobalista (hand balista), arcubalista and manubalista, this last Roman version was almost all metal composed (the spring mechanism and the skeins). There was also the katapeltikon (399 BC), a siege weapon using similar mechanisms. Unlike the Chinese <b>crossbow,</b> the heavy weight and bulk of these weapons necessitated a prop to keep them standing.|$|E
5|$|The pivot catapult, {{known as}} the {{traction}} trebuchet, had existed in China since the Warring States period (as evidenced by the Mozi). It was regularly used in sieges during the Han dynasty, by both besiegers and the besieged. The most common projectile weapon used during the Han dynasty was the small handheld, trigger-activated <b>crossbow</b> (and to a lesser extent, the repeating <b>crossbow),</b> first invented in China during the 6th or 5th century BCE. Although the nomadic Xiongnu were able to twist their waists slightly while horse-riding and shoot arrows at targets behind them, the official Chao Cuo (d. 154 BCE) deemed the Chinese <b>crossbow</b> superior to the Xiongnu bow.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the very}} brief nature of the Spanish {{occupation}} of the city, very few European artefacts were found. Those few pieces that were found consisted of forged iron <b>crossbow</b> bolts.|$|E

50|$|Pistol <b>crossbows</b> are {{strictly}} controlled in all Australian states {{due to their}} concealable nature. <b>Crossbows</b> can be bought and owned by adults over 18 years of age, while in most states <b>crossbows</b> can only be owned with a special licence, for instance for members of an official sporting club. Control on transport of <b>crossbows</b> between states has increased to prevent unauthorised use of imported <b>crossbows.</b>|$|R
50|$|In German law on weapons, <b>crossbows</b> and {{firearms}} are equated in their legal status as weapons (WaffG Anlage 1 1.2.2), but {{in contrast to}} guns, acquisition, possession, trade or production of <b>crossbows</b> requires no license (WaffG Anlage 2). Because of their definition as weapons, but without further restrictions, any <b>crossbows</b> {{can be used by}} minors under custody of competent adults. Fishing and hunting with <b>crossbows</b> is prohibited. As a specialty to be noted is that, <b>crossbows</b> do not shoot as per legal definition in Germany, since they don't use expanding gases or similar mechanisms to propel a projectile.|$|R
5|$|Baha al-Din also {{described}} {{the difference in}} power between the Crusader <b>crossbow</b> and the bows of his own army. He saw Frankish infantrymen with from one to ten arrows sticking from their armoured backs marching along with no apparent hurt, whilst the crossbows struck down both horse and man amongst the Muslims.|$|E
5|$|The musket, or musquet, {{originally}} {{a kind of}} <b>crossbow</b> bolt, and later a small cannon, was named after the male Eurasian sparrowhawk because of its size. The British Gloster Aircraft Company named one of their Mars series craft the Sparrowhawk.|$|E
5|$|After King John's death, however, St Briavels Castle {{became the}} primary centre for English quarrel manufacture. The <b>crossbow</b> was an {{important}} military advance on the older short bow and was the favoured weapon {{by the time of}} Richard Imany crossbows and even more quarrels were needed to supply royal forces. Crossbows were primarily built at the Tower of London, but St Briavels Castle, with the local forest to provide raw materials, became the national centre for quarrel manufacture.|$|E
50|$|In Norway, <b>crossbows</b> are {{considered}} equivalent to firearms, and possession requires a license (Innførsel og utførsel av våpen, Tollvesenet). Hunting with <b>crossbows</b> is not allowed.|$|R
50|$|In Asia, some Chinese {{armed forces}} use <b>crossbows,</b> {{including}} the special force Snow Leopard Commando Unit of the People's Armed Police and the People's Liberation Army. One justification for this {{comes in the}} <b>crossbow's</b> ability to stop persons carrying explosives without risk of causing detonation. During the Xinjiang riots of July 2009, <b>crossbows</b> were used alongside modern military hardware to quell protests. The Indian Navy's Marine Commando Force were equipped until the late 1980s with <b>crossbows</b> supplied with cyanide-tipped bolts, {{as an alternative to}} suppressed handguns.|$|R
50|$|In Sweden, <b>crossbows</b> are {{considered}} equivalent to firearms, and possession requires a license. Hunting with <b>crossbows</b> is not allowed. Swedish law dictates that any weapon that stores its energy, i.e., weapons with a firing mechanism, that produces more than 10 joules at the muzzle are illegal without licence. Thus very weak <b>crossbows</b> {{are sold in}} toy stores as well as low powered air rifles (not sold to minors). Sale or possession of normal bows of any strength are regulated {{in the same way}} as the previously mentioned weak <b>crossbows</b> and air rifles.|$|R
5|$|Bethesda Softworks {{developed}} a spin-off iOS game, Dishonored: Rat Assassin, which it released {{free of charge}} on 30 August 2012. The game requires players to use a knife and <b>crossbow</b> to kill rats while avoiding bombs. Rat Assassin was well received for the variety and quantity of content provided, but received some criticism for dark visuals, that {{made it difficult to}} see the rats. The game drew frequent comparisons to another mobile game, Fruit Ninja.|$|E
5|$|Chromium, use of: The use of {{chromium}} {{was invented}} in China no later than 210 BC when the Terracotta Army was interred at a site not far from modern Xi'an; modern archaeologists discovered that bronze-tipped <b>crossbow</b> bolts at the site {{showed no sign of}} corrosion after more than 2,000 years, because they had been coated in chromium. Chromium was not used anywhere else until the experiments of French pharmacist and chemist Louis Nicolas Vauquelin (1763–1829) in the late 1790s.|$|E
5|$|Like a free-to-play game, it {{continued}} to receive updates years after its release. A free post-launch update in June 2016 added a zombies mode—Death Valley Challenge Mode—wherein the player defends a human against encroaching zombies as he attempts to repair his car. The addition has three levels of difficulty and additional weapon upgrades and player achievements. Later that year, Square Enix Montreal added a Halloween theme and a limited-edition <b>crossbow</b> weapon with special abilities such as making a target's ghost into the player's ally.|$|E

50|$|By the Late Middle Ages most European <b>crossbows</b> {{employed}} a windlass as a cocking mechanism, which helped to pull heavier <b>crossbows,</b> but {{were used in}} England as early as 1215.|$|R
50|$|In Denmark, the {{creation}} or import of <b>crossbows</b> {{without a license}} is prohibited by Danish law on weapons (Våbenloven - Bekendtgørelse af lov om våben og eksplosivstoffer), and <b>crossbows</b> are not recognized as legal weapons for hunting.|$|R
5|$|The Moon and {{the planets}} are Yin; they have shape but no light. This they receive {{only when the}} Sun {{illuminates}} them. The former masters regarded the Sun as round like a <b>crossbow</b> bullet, and they thought the Moon had {{the nature of a}} mirror. Some of them recognized the Moon as a ball too. Those parts of the Moon which the Sun illuminates look bright, those parts which it does not, remain dark.|$|E
5|$|The {{identification}} of German missile sites by the PRU made Operation <b>Crossbow</b> possible in 1944. Coastal Command continually identified German V-1 launch ramps, despite the German camouflage efforts. This enabled British aircraft to bomb them and reduce their effectiveness by one-third. By June, 69 ramps had been located, {{although it was}} not until 26 February 1945, when Squadron Leader J.E.S. White actually spotted a V-2, on its launch pad, ready to fire, that it became clear how elusive a weapon of that size could be.|$|E
5|$|The {{siege of}} Bedford Castle {{required}} huge resources. Siege engines were brought from Lincoln, Northampton and Oxfordshire, while carpenters built others on site using timber from Northamptonshire; ropes from London, Cambridge and Southampton; hides from Northampton and tallow from London. Labourers from across Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire were {{gathered by the}} relevant sheriffs, and miners from Hereford and the Forest of Dean. <b>Crossbow</b> bolts were ordered from a depot at Corfe Castle and from the provinces; 43,300 <b>crossbow</b> bolts {{are known to have}} been ordered by the king. Local trees were cut down, and stone quarrying begun to provide ammunition for siege engines. Tents and pavilions for the King were sent from London along with supplies of luxury foods and wine, also for the King. In total, Henry's wage bill for the siege came to £1,311; it is uncertain exactly how large Henry's army was, but potentially there were between 1,600 and 2,700 men present at any one time. To support the siege, Langton instructed his bishops to mobilise one man from every 24 hectares (60 acres) of land they owned and levied a special tax on the churches' estates.|$|E
5|$|The 16th-century Spanish conquistadors {{were armed}} with one- and two-handed broadswords, lances, pikes, rapiers, halberds, <b>crossbows,</b> matchlocks and light artillery. <b>Crossbows</b> were easier to {{maintain}} than matchlocks, {{especially in the}} humid tropical climate of the Caribbean region that included much of the Yucatán Peninsula.|$|R
50|$|Mounted knights {{armed with}} lances proved {{ineffective}} against formations of pikemen combined with crossbowmen whose weapons could penetrate most knights' armor. The invention of pushlever and ratchet drawing mechanisms enabled {{the use of}} <b>crossbows</b> on horseback, leading {{to the development of}} new cavalry tactics. Knights and mercenaries deployed in triangular formations, with the most heavily armored knights at the front. Some of these riders would carry small, powerful all-metal <b>crossbows</b> of their own. <b>Crossbows</b> were eventually replaced in warfare by more powerful gunpowder weapons, although early guns had slower rates of fire and much worse accuracy than contemporary <b>crossbows.</b> Later, similar competing tactics would feature harquebusiers or musketeers in formation with pikemen (pike and shot), pitted against cavalry firing pistols or carbines.|$|R

5|$|A cryptozoologist named Lincoln Anderson, a {{biologist}} named Wendy Gardner, and a hunter named Cameron Caine visit {{the town and}} have a brief meeting with Overman to discuss capturing the shark. With six of his friends, armed with guns, Mike ventures into the forest to hunt the shark. The shark kills each person except for Mike. Following this, Chapman, Lincoln, Wendy, and Cameron {{make their way into}} the woods, armed with a miniature <b>crossbow,</b> a shotgun, and a motion-sensing camera. They set up the camera on a tree and depart. At the town bar, Professor Hoffman enters, having gone into hiding and now wearing an eyepatch. Later, he and a grieving Mike drink beers.|$|E
5|$|Arrowslits, also {{commonly}} called loopholes, were narrow vertical openings in defensive walls which allowed arrows or <b>crossbow</b> bolts {{to be fired}} on attackers. The narrow slits were intended to protect the defender by providing a very small target, but {{the size of the}} opening could also impede the defender if it was too small. A smaller horizontal opening could be added to give an archer a better view for aiming. Sometimes a sally port was included; this could allow the garrison to leave the castle and engage besieging forces. It was usual for the latrines to empty down the external walls of a castle and into the surrounding ditch.|$|E
5|$|During the {{daylight}} hours, Jericho's powers are gone, {{so he has}} to fight as a normal human, using a wide variety of weaponry, from a Darkwatch's standard-issue 24-shot Redeemer handgun to a <b>crossbow</b> firing explosive arrows and a rocket launcher, as well as melee combat. In some missions, Jericho can drive a Gatling gun-equipped Coyote Steamwagon vehicle; using it or a horse changes perspective to the third-person view. During horse-riding rail shooter sequences, Jericho is granted unlimited ammunition and high attack speed, at the cost of only being able to use the Redeemer.|$|E

5|$|Following {{repeated}} heavy bombing by Allied forces during Operation <b>Crossbow,</b> the Germans {{were unable}} to complete the construction works and the complex never entered service. It was captured by the Allies in September 1944, partially demolished on the orders of Winston Churchill to prevent its reuse as a military base, and then abandoned. It remained derelict until the mid-1990s. In 1997 it {{opened to the public}} for the first time, as a museum. Exhibits in the tunnels and under the dome {{tell the story of the}} German occupation of France during World War II, the V-weapons and the history of space exploration.|$|E
5|$|From the 12th century on, the <b>crossbow</b> (called , tzangra in Greek) became {{increasingly}} important in Mediterranean warfare, remaining the most deadly weapon available until {{the advent of}} fully rigged ships with gunpowder artillery. The Byzantines made infrequent use of the weapon, chiefly in sieges, although its use is recorded in some sea battles. Cannons were introduced {{in the latter half}} of the 14th century, but they were rarely used by the Byzantines, who only had a few artillery pieces for the defence of the land walls of Constantinople. Unlike the Venetians and Genoese, there is no indication that the Byzantines ever mounted any on ships.|$|E
5|$|In New Orleans, a {{homeless}} veteran named Douglas Binder (Chuck Pfarrer) {{is the target}} of a hunt. He is given a belt containing $10,000 and told that he must reach {{the other side of town}} where he would then win the money and his life. Pursuing him is the hunt organizer Emil Fouchon (Lance Henriksen), his lieutenant Pik Van Cleef (Arnold Vosloo), a businessman named Mr. Lopaki who has paid $500,000 for the opportunity to hunt a human, and mercenaries including Stephan (Sven-Ole Thorsen) and Peterson (Jules Sylvester). Binder fails to reach his destination and is shot by three <b>crossbow</b> bolts. Van Cleef retrieves the money belt.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Crossbows</b> and Catapults, {{also known}} as Battlegrounds, is a game of {{physical}} skill first released in 1983. It has since been published by several different game publishers including Lakeside, Alga (Brio), Base Toys, Tomy and currently Moose Toys (under the name Battlegrounds <b>Crossbows</b> and Catapults). In the game two sides, originally Vikings and Barbarians but later other names were used, build fortifications from plastic bricks then opposing players attempt to destroy each other's castle with rubber-band powered <b>crossbows</b> (similar to ballistae) and catapults firing plastic disks. In the most recent version launched in 2007, the two sides were Orcs and Knights.|$|R
