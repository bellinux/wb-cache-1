50|$|In Helmond a {{variation}} of this tradition can be found: a man-sized boulder representing <b>Carnaval,</b> <b>which</b> is buried on the forecourt, is dug up every year on Carnaval Saturday. The boulder stays above ground for four days {{as a symbol of}} the Carnaval. At the very end of the Carnaval it is buried again until the following year, while the bystanders mourn for it by loud wailing and weeping.|$|R
50|$|It {{is common}} for cities with a Burgundian carnaval {{tradition}} to change their name during carnaval (although there are some places in eastern Netherlands with the Rhenish <b>carnaval</b> <b>which</b> do this as well). This name changing tradition is especially common in the towns in and around North Brabant. The tradition to change the city names originates in North Brabant and is seldom seen in Limburg. In Limburg some towns do change their name during carnaval into a dialect version.|$|R

5000|$|The band {{started with}} {{the search for a}} new lead singer for the band The Legendary Texas Four. Jack Poels, {{formerly}} singing in the band Bad Edge, was willing to fulfill this position, on the condition he was allowed to do one song in dialect. The other band members agreed and Rowwen Hèze was born. In the early years they mostly played covers in English. A lot of bands from Limburg compose a song every <b>Carnaval,</b> <b>which</b> is a big cultural event in that region. Rowwen Hèze became known in all of the Netherlands with the Carnaval song [...] "Niks stront niks" [...] (no crap nothing). After that they gradually sang more and more songs in their local dialect.|$|R
50|$|Placetas {{was founded}} on September 9, 1861 mainly due to the sugar {{production}} industry. Nowadays, the main produce of the area is tobacco. The main contribution to its foundation came from Jose Martinez-Fortun y Erles, a Spanish Marques and former colonel in the Spanish Army. The town {{is located on the}} Carretera Central road, which cuts through the town. The town's position on this road has allowed it to serve as a stop for many travellers. Placetas has grown considerably over the years, being declared a town in 1881 and a city in 1925. In 1879 it was established as its own municipality. Placetas is also known by the great <b>carnavals</b> <b>which</b> take place in July and Christmas and New Year's Eve.|$|R

50|$|Hossen (jumping {{together}} in a group) {{is a way of}} dancing during the <b>carnaval</b> <b>which</b> is mainly found in Brabant, also the polonaise is done during the carnaval. In the southernmost part of the Netherlands in Limburg, there are three ways of carnaval dancing: sjoenkele (slowly moving back and forth, left to right, etc. while sitting or standing with ones arms on the shoulders of the person beside him or with the arms hooked together at 3/4 tact), pogo-ing (jumping up and down by oneself) and the polonaise. In southern Limburg the polonaise is called the reijaloet. The polonaise is usually done spontaneous and for short moment of times, but can be done by dozens of people together. Also during the parade and official gatherings there are usual dance shows performed by the majorettes called dansmarietjes or dansmariekes in Dutch.|$|R
50|$|Her {{work as a}} {{choreographer}} {{with the}} Royal Theatre began in 1906 under the ballet master Hans Beck. Her first success was her adaptation of Marius Petipa's Les millions d'Arlequin, which proved popular with both the cast and the audience. It was followed in 1908 by Askepot (Cinderella) with her own libretto and music composed by Otto Malling. Drømmebilleder (1915) proved to be her masterpiece. Based on Michel Fokine's <b>Carnaval</b> <b>which</b> was created for Les Ballets Russes, it was fully adapted to Denmark and arranged for music by H.C. Lumbye. It {{led the way to}} a new approach to Danish ballet inspired by Les Ballets Russes with further works in the same style. Another success was En Nat i Ægypten (1918), based on Folkine's Cleopatra. All in all, she created 15 new works, 11 ballets and one ballet pantomime and two plays.|$|R
2500|$|... 1 March – Some {{cities such}} as El Tigre, Anaco, Tigrito, Píritu refused to {{celebrate}} Carnaval and protesters placed crosses representing those fallen during the protests on beaches popular during <b>Carnaval,</b> <b>which</b> had few visitors due to the protests. Carnaval celebrations in cities also had few attendees due to the protests with most of those at celebrations being police officers. The water in a fountain at Plaza Francia in Caracas was dyed red in protest of the deaths caused by violence. The Venezuelan Attorney General, Luisa Ortega Díaz, denied the opposition's claims of students being the main target of the Venezuelan government, {{when in fact they}} represent 35% of all detainees. She also stated that at least 27 government agents are being investigated for violations against human rights, plus another five accused of killing three people {{on the first day of}} protests. Meanwhile, President Maduro announced that a National Guard officer had died and another two had been wounded by sniper fire.|$|R
40|$|This thesis proposes the samba enredo, {{a complex}} {{narrative}} composed by Rio de Janeiro samba {{schools for the}} annual Carnaval parade, as a vital primary source for understanding the construction of Afro-Brazilian identity in contemporary Brazilian society. Next, I provide an analysis of one specific samba enredo presented by the samba school Unidos da Vila Isabel in the 2012 Rio <b>Carnaval,</b> <b>which</b> portrays the cultural link between Angola and Brazil. I argue that the narrative Vila Isabel constructs is a thoughtful, albeit incomplete, alternative to the more common link drawn between Yoruba culture and Afro-Brazil. Furthermore, I ascertain that this samba enredo, and the academic sources used to compose it, lack a clear definition of the religious dimension of Angolan heritage in Afro-Brazilian culture because they place Central African conversions to Catholicism {{in the context of}} slavery and do not cite the impact that Catholicism makes in Angola before the context of slavery and the Diaspora encounter in colonial Brazil. 2019 - 11 - 0...|$|R
50|$|In the {{southern}} part of the Netherlands during Carnaval, normal daily life comes to a near stop. Roads are temporarily blocked and many local businesses close for the week because many employees take days off during and after Carnaval. According to tradition, the feast lasts from Sunday until Tuesday. In recent years the feast usually starts on Saturday. Also Friday evening (or at schools at Friday afternoon) and in some places Thursday (Ouwe Wijven) are considered the start of <b>Carnaval,</b> <b>which</b> makes it a six days' celebration. The festivities last the entire day and well into the nights. Some parades and many balls and bonte avonden or other meetings are held in the weeks before the official Carnaval, but never before the first official court meeting on 11 November. Historically the 40 days of Lent would start on Wednesday at midnight and continue until Easter. Nowadays it is still the official ending of Carnaval, though some Carnaval activities such as herring eating are traditionally held on Wednesday after Carnaval. Lent itself is generally not practiced anymore by the Southern Dutch population as a result of irreligion dominating the area nowadays.|$|R

25|$|Her Brazilian film {{career was}} linked to a genre of musical films which drew on the nation's {{carnival}} traditions and the annual celebration and musical style of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's capital at the time. Miranda performed a musical number in O Carnaval Cantado no Rio (1932, the first sound documentary on the subject) and three songs in A Voz do <b>Carnaval</b> (1933), <b>which</b> combined footage of street celebrations in Rio with a fictitious plot providing a pretext for musical numbers.|$|R

They decided on Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, relatively early on, a city that Cubby Broccoli had visited on vacation, and a team was sent to that city in early 1978 to capture initial footage from the <b>Carnaval</b> festival, <b>which</b> featured in the film.|$|R
5000|$|Benvenuto Cellini [...] is {{an opera}} semiseria in two acts with music by Hector Berlioz and {{libretto}} by Léon de Wailly and Henri Auguste Barbier. It {{was the first}} of Berlioz's operas, premiered at the Académie Royale de Musique (Salle Le Peletier) on 10 September 1838. The story is inspired by the memoirs of the Florentine sculptor Benvenuto Cellini, although the elements of the plot are largely fictional. The opera is technically very challenging and rarely performed. However, the overture to the opera sometimes features in symphony orchestra programs, as does the concert overture Le <b>carnaval</b> romain <b>which</b> Berlioz composed from material in the opera.|$|R
