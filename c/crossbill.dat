5|$|The South Hills <b>crossbill</b> is a finch {{endemic to}} the South Hills and Albion Mountains in the Minidoka District. It rarely interbreeds with similar crossbills that {{are present in}} its range, {{and it has been}} {{proposed}} as a separate species created via ecological speciation. The American Ornithologists' Union failed to find consensus on the issue so the South Hills <b>crossbill</b> is still considered a subspecies of the red <b>crossbill.</b>|$|E
5|$|Until 2009, {{the parrot}} <b>crossbill</b> was an anomaly, {{in that it}} was on the committee's list of species, even though a {{breeding}} population existed in Scotland. In 2009, this species was removed, along with white-billed diver and cattle egret.|$|E
5|$|Many {{populations of}} moorland birds, {{including}} {{the black and}} red grouse live here, and the country has internationally significant nesting grounds for seabirds such as the northern gannet. The golden eagle has become a national icon, and white-tailed eagles and ospreys have recently re-colonised the land. The Scottish <b>crossbill</b> is the only endemic vertebrate species in the UK.|$|E
5000|$|RSPB {{research}} {{showed that}} Scottish <b>crossbills</b> have quite distinct flight and excitement calls from other <b>crossbills</b> [...] - [...] some even stated they have [...] "Scottish accents".|$|R
50|$|Results {{showed that}} of over 40 pairs of {{different}} types of <b>crossbills</b> caught, almost all matched closely for bill size and calls, so the different types of <b>crossbills</b> were behaving as distinct species.|$|R
5000|$|Sewall {{explored}} {{the variation in}} learned bird songs in relation to social and genetic intermixing of families of red <b>crossbills</b> (Loxia curvirostra). [...] When given to foster parents, it was shown that fledgling <b>crossbills</b> will imitate the particular variations in their foster parents' calls. It was thus hypothesized that such idiosyncrasies in call could aid in creating familial cohesion and that when such call variants are passed down generations, those variants are direct signals of the <b>crossbill's</b> genetic and familial history.|$|R

The teeth and jaws of carnivores, herbivores and omnivores are considered. Similarly, the adaptations of birds' bills in species like the <b>crossbill,</b> spoonbill and (long-billed) snipe are discussed.|$|E
5|$|Other British Birds rarities {{that have}} been sighted (single records unless {{otherwise}} indicated) are: Little bittern, glossy ibis, gyrfalcon (3 records), little and Baillon's crakes, collared pratincole, semipalmated (5 records), least (2 records), white-rumped and Baird's (2 records) sandpipers, Wilson's phalarope, laughing gull, bridled tern, Pallas's sandgrouse, great spotted, black-billed and yellow-billed (3 records) cuckoos, European roller, olive-backed pipit, citrine wagtail, Alpine accentor, thrush nightingale, red-flanked bluetail, black-eared (2 records) and desert wheatears, White's, Swainson's (3 records), and grey-cheeked (2 records) thrushes, Sardinian (2 records), Arctic (3 records), Radde's and western Bonelli's warblers, Isabelline and lesser grey shrikes, red-eyed vireo (7 records), two-barred <b>crossbill,</b> yellow-rumped and blackpoll warblers, yellow-breasted (2 records) and black-headed (3 records) buntings, rose-breasted grosbeak (2 records), bobolink and Baltimore oriole (2 records).|$|E
5|$|On {{the high}} {{mountain}} tops, species including ptarmigan, mountain hare and stoat {{can be seen}} in their white colour phase during winter months. Remnants of the native Scots pine forest exist and within these areas the Scottish <b>crossbill,</b> the UK's only endemic bird species and vertebrate, can be found alongside capercaillie, Scottish wildcat, red squirrel and pine marten. Various animals have been re-introduced, including the white-tailed sea eagle in 1975, the red kite in the 1980s, and there have been experimental projects involving the beaver and wild boar. Today, much of the remaining native Caledonian Forest lies within the Cairngorms National Park and remnants of the forest remain at 84 locations across Scotland. On the west coast, remnants of ancient Celtic Rainforest still remain, particularly on the Taynish peninsula in Argyll, these forests are particularly rare due to high rates of deforestation throughout Scottish history.|$|E
25|$|The wooded slopes are host {{to their}} own bird species, in {{particular}} the ring ouzel, the common raven, and the golden eagle. More generally, the forests have Eurasian three-toed woodpeckers, parrot <b>crossbills,</b> red <b>crossbills,</b> common redstarts , bramblings and Siberian jays, which last bird is {{the symbol of the}} park.|$|R
5|$|The same {{applies to}} herbivores, animals that eat plants, {{and the plants}} that they eat. In the Rocky Mountains, red {{squirrels}} and <b>crossbills</b> (seed-eating birds) compete for seeds of the lodgepole pine. The squirrels get at pine seeds by gnawing through the cone scales, whereas the <b>crossbills</b> get at the seeds by extracting them with their unusual crossed mandibles. In areas where there are squirrels, the lodgepole's cones are heavier, and have fewer seeds and thinner scales, {{making it more difficult}} for squirrels to get at the seeds. Conversely, where there are <b>crossbills</b> but no squirrels, the cones are lighter in construction, but have thicker scales, making it more difficult for <b>crossbills</b> to get at the seeds. The lodgepole's cones are in an evolutionary arms race with the two kinds of herbivore.|$|R
50|$|In future years, Scottish <b>crossbills</b> {{could suffer}} {{from the effects of}} global warming.|$|R
25|$|The {{shape or}} {{color of the}} culmen can also help with the {{identification}} of birds in the field. For example, the culmen of the parrot <b>crossbill</b> is strongly decurved, while that of the very similar red <b>crossbill</b> is more moderately curved. The culmen of a juvenile common loon is all dark, while that of the very similarly plumaged juvenile yellow-billed loon is pale towards the tip.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, opportunists {{can have}} qualities of {{seasonal}} breeders. The red <b>crossbill</b> exhibits a preference (not a requirement) for long-day seasonality, but requires other factors, especially food abundance and social interactions, {{in order to}} breed. Conversely, food availability by itself incompletely promotes reproductive development.|$|E
25|$|West Amargosa {{was renamed}} Empire <b>Crossbill.</b> She was {{allocated}} the United Kingdom Official Number 168177 and Code Letters MLNP. Her {{port of registry}} was London. She departed Middlesbrough on 30 May for the Tyne, returning to Middlesbrough on 2 June and departing the same day for the Tyne again. On 10 June, she joined Convoy EC 31, which had departed from Southend, Essex on 9 June and arrived at Loch Ewe on 14 June. She then joined Convoy OB 334, which departed from Liverpool on 11 June and arrived at Halifax on 25 June. She left the convoy at St John's, Newfoundland on 24 June. Empire <b>Crossbill</b> departed St. John's that day for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, arriving on 2 July.|$|E

50|$|<b>Crossbills</b> are {{characterized}} by the mandibles crossing at their tips, which gives the group its English name. Using their crossed mandibles for leverage, <b>crossbills</b> are able to efficiently separate the scales of conifer cones and extract the seeds on which they feed. Adult males tend to be red or orange in colour, and females green or yellow, but there is much variation.|$|R

25|$|Pinus strobus {{is found}} in the nearctic {{temperate}} broadleaf and mixed forests biome of eastern North America. It prefers well-drained or sandy soils and humid climates, but can also grow in boggy areas and rocky highlands. In mixed forests, this dominant tree towers over many others, including some of the large broadleaf hardwoods. It provides food and shelter for numerous forest birds, such as the red <b>crossbill,</b> and small mammals such as squirrels.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} {{to the work of}} collating descriptions and commissioning drawings and engravings, Yarrell also made his own scientific observations of certain topics, including the description of the trachea of several species, and a detailed account, occupying seven pages, of the skull, jaw, musculature, and feeding behaviour of the common <b>crossbill,</b> Loxia curvirostra. The article for the <b>crossbill</b> is one of the longest in the book, at 20 pages. Yarrell introduces his special interest in this bird's head as follows: ...|$|E

The 's length along the culmen is one of the regular measurements made during bird ringing and is particularly useful in feeding studies. The shape or colour of the culmen can also help with the identification of birds in the field. For example, the culmen of the parrot <b>crossbill</b> is strongly decurved, while that of the very similar red <b>crossbill</b> is more moderately curved.|$|E
50|$|<b>Crossbills</b> are {{specialist}} feeders on conifer cones, and {{the unusual}} bill shape is an adaptation which {{enables them to}} extract seeds from cones. These birds are typically found in higher northern hemisphere latitudes, where their food sources grow. They erupt out of the breeding range when the cone crop fails. <b>Crossbills</b> breed {{very early in the}} year, often in winter months, to take advantage of maximum cone supplies.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} here {{an affordable}} method for assessing patterns and colour variations in male <b>Crossbills</b> Loxia spp. Our {{aim was to}} validate qualitative colour categories obtained in the field through visual inspection with quantitative data obtained from a colorimeter. Patterns and colour variations of 219 male Common <b>Crossbills</b> Loxia curvirostra were measured using both techniques. We {{found that there was}} a close correspondence between the tristimulus scores generated by the colorimeter and our visual scoring system. These results support the accuracy of our visual colour assessment procedure and provide amateurs, field ornithologists and researchers interested in <b>Crossbills</b> with an easy, inexpensive, repeatable and objective alternative to the use of modern electronic devices. In a more general sense, our results suggest that visual colour inspection may in fact be more objective and useful than currently thought...|$|R
500|$|Animals in the Trout Creek Mountains are {{adapted to}} the {{environment}} of the High Desert. [...] Pronghorn are common in the open, sagebrush-covered basins, while mule deer live in the cottonwood and willow groves.
