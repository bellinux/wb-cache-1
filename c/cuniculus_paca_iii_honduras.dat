40|$|Abstract. Departing {{from the}} current {{development}} and Ecuadorian strategy, this paper assesses the wildlife species named <b>Cuniculus</b> <b>Paca</b> {{as a source of}} bush meat for local rural communities settled along the Pacific coast. At the outset, two premises are set up: on the one hand, a distinction is made between Cuniculus Pacaas a positional good and as a relational good and, on the other hand, custom is assumed lying behind in its chasing process. Thereby, it proposes a methodology to value the aforementioned specie from both economic and ecological standpoints, but also incorporating in the later the variable Good Living (“Buen vivir”), which is measured by the level of satisfaction of the relational good that is co-produced along hunting. It is also assumed that this supplementary activity carried out by local people is largely a tradition passed on from one generation to another. The paper also calculates the abundance average relative index top lace the <b>Cuniculus</b> <b>paca</b> population in the wild. An econometric model is then specified to estimate the effect of Good Living (“Buen vivir”) on its social value of the <b>Cuniculus</b> <b>Paca.</b> Based upon the estimated results some right policies to ensure a sustainable management of such resource are brought to the fore to ensure the bush meat consumption among local peasants, in line with the Good Living (“Buen vivir”) convocation.

40|$|The <b>paca</b> (<b>Cuniculus</b> <b>paca)</b> is {{the second}} largest rodent of the Brazilian fauna. The {{excellent}} meat quality of this specie encourages {{the development of their}} commercial production. Moreover, this animal can become a viable alternative for animal experimentation although there exists scarce detailed information concerning their morphology. Therefore {{the purpose of this study}} is to describe the morphology, morphometry and ultrastructure in segments of the cranial and caudal portions of vena cava in four adult males and females of <b>Cuniculus</b> <b>paca</b> from the squad of Wild Animals Sector of Animal Science Department of FCAV-Unesp. Parts of the segments were examined by light microscopy and part by scanning electron microscopy. Thickness measures of the tunica intima and media complex and tunica adventitia of the vena cava were taken and analyzed using T test (p< 0. 05). In vena cava the thickness values of the intima, media and adventitia, for all animals, were significantly higher in the cranial segment.

40|$|During 2009 – 2012, {{wild animals}} were sampled in two areas within the Amazon biome of Brazil, {{in the states}} of Mato Grosso and Pará. Animal tissues and blood were molecularly tested for the {{presence}} of Piroplasmida (genera Babesia, Theileria, Cytauxzoon) or Hepatozoon DNA. Overall, 181 wild animals comprising 36 different species (2 reptiles, 5 birds, and 29 mammals) were sampled. The following Piroplasmida agents were detected: Cytauxzoon felis in one ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), Theileria cervi in two red brocket deer (Mazama americana), Theileria spp. in three nine-banded-armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus), one agouti (Dasyprocta sp.), and four lowland <b>pacas</b> (<b>Cuniculus</b> <b>paca),</b> Babesia spp. in one common opossum (Didelphis marsupialis) and one white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari). The following Hepatozoon agents were detected: Hepatozoon sp.

40|$|The Pacific Tropical Rainforest and Equatorial Dry Forest {{are found}} only in {{southern}} Ecuador and northern Peru, and {{are among the most}} poorly known ecosystems of South America. Even though these forests are protected in Parque Nacional Cerros de Amotape (PNCA), they are threatened by fragmentation because of farming and agriculture. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the medium and large mammalian species richness, using transect census, camera trapping, and specimen bone collection. Nine transects were established and 21 camera trap stations were placed along 16 km 2 in three localities of PNCA, from August 2012 to April 2013. Total sampling effort was 215 km of transects and 4077 camera-days. We documented 22 species; including 17 with camera trapping, 11 with transect census, and 10 with specimen collection.  Camera traps were the most effective method, and four species (Dasyprocta punctata, <b>Cuniculus</b> <b>paca,</b> Leopardus wiedii and Puma concolor) were documented only with this method. This comprised the first Peruvian record for Dasyprocta punctata, and the first record for the western slope of the Peruvian Andes for <b>Cuniculus</b> <b>paca.</b> Also, both specimen collections and sightings confirm the presence of Potos flavus, first record in the western slope of the Peruvian Andes.

40|$|Abstract <b>Paca</b> (<b>Cuniculus</b> <b>paca</b> Linnaeus, 1766) is {{the second}} largest rodent found in Brazil. The quality of the meat and a long {{tradition}} of hunting have contributed to the decline of the natural populations of this species. Hunting of paca is strictly prohibited in Brazil, but in spite of this restriction, no forensic tools are available for the identification of the meat. We describe an efficient method, based on single nucleotide polymorphisms of the cytochrome b gene, {{that can be used to}} differentiate biological material derived from paca from those of domestic species commonly used as sources of meat.

Results indicate that this rodent uses holes in the ground or in fallen trees as sleeping dens. Each of these sleeping dens had two or more orifices and an internal cavity for the "diurnal sleep”. Typically, one orifice was for common use and the rest for the circumstantial escape. According to their form, their localization in the ground, and the number and location of orifices, sleeping dens were classified into four types, of which type A was the most common.

40|$|The {{alien species}} Artocarpus heterophyllus, {{originally}} from India, {{was introduced to}} Brazil in the colonial period and has become invasive in some areas in the Atlantic Forest. Its fruits can weigh 35 kg and produce up to 500 seeds each. In their native range they are dispersed by turtles, rodents, monkeys, wild pigs and elephants. This study aimed to investigate the influence of mammals in jackfruit predation and seed dispersal, {{as well as the}} influence of jackfruit in native plant species dispersal by mammals, in the Ilha Grande State Park, Southeastern Brazil. Seeds with and without mesocarp were tied to thread spools and checked for predation and dispersion on 37 sites. We recorded mesocarp or jackfruit seed feeding on video. Six species of mammals were recorded feeding on jackfruit, but Trinomys dimidiatus, Didelphis aurita and <b>Cuniculus</b> <b>paca</b> accounted for 92 % of all records. <b>Cuniculus</b> <b>paca</b> and Trinomys dimidiatus preyed and dispersed seeds while Didelphis aurita consumed mesocarp only. Seeds with mesocarp were more preyed on than seeds without mesocarp and its consumption was lower during more intense fruit production. Hence, jackfruit production can exceed the capacity of mammals to consume its seeds in areas where jackfruit density is high. Faeces of small mammals were collected in areas with (10 grids) and without jackfruits (8 grids) and analysed for the presence of native seeds. Twelve small mammal species were captured in areas with and without jackfruits, but faeces of 11 species were collected. Didelphis aurita dispersed proportionally more native seeds in area without jackfruits. Our results showed that mammals are playing a negative role helping to disperse jackfruit trees, and this is occurring in different ways depending on mammal species...|$|R

The aims {{of this study were}} to identify distinctive characteristics of cavities used by pacas and to verify if these rodents used the cavities in proportion to their availability. We studied 3 sites with different land use where 42 cavities potentially used by pacas were detected and characterized, the presence of pacas was confirmed in 24 cavities using camera traps. The differences between cavities with and without paca presence were analyzed. In the study area, pacas used cavities underneath roots and inside fallen logs in secondary and riparian vegetation that were within 100 m from water bodies.
