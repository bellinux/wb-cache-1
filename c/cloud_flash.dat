40|$|Continental US {{lightning}} flashes {{observed by}} the Optical Transient Detector (OTD) are categorized according to flash type (ground or <b>cloud</b> <b>flash)</b> using US National Lightning Detection Network (TM) (NLDN) data. The statistics {{of the ground}} and <b>cloud</b> <b>flash</b> optical parameters (e. g., radiance, area, duration, number of optical groups, and number of optical events) are inter-compared. On average, the ground flash cloud-top emissions are more radiant, illuminate a larger area, are longer lasting, and have more optical groups and optical events than those cloud-top emissions associated with cloud flashes. Given these differences, {{it is suggested that}} the methods of Bayesian Inference could be used to help discriminate between ground and cloud flashes. The ability to discriminate flash type on-orbit is highly desired since such information would help researchers and operational decision makers better assess the intensification, evolutionary state, and severe weather potential of thunderstorms.

The retrieval itself is {{expressed in terms of}} a Bayesian inference, and the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) solution is obtained. The approach is tested by performing simulated retrievals, and retrieval error statistics are provided. The ability to retrieve ground flash fraction has important benefits to the atmospheric chemistry community. For example, using the method to partition the existing satellite global lightning climatology into separate ground and <b>cloud</b> <b>flash</b> climatologies will improve estimates of lightning nitrogen oxides (NOx) production; this in turn will improve both regional air quality and global chemistry/climate model predictions...|$|E

40|$|Remote {{measurement}} of electric field generated by lightning {{has played a}} major role in understanding the lightning phenomenon. Even though other measurements such as photographic and channel base current have contributed to this research field, due to practical reasons remote measurements of electric field is considered as the most useful tool in lightning research. This thesis discusses the remotely measured radiation field component of electric field generated by <b>cloud</b> <b>flashes</b> (ICs) and narrow bipolar pulses (NBPs). The associated HF radiation of these events at 3 MHz and 30 MHz are also discussed. To understand the initiation process of these discharges, a comparative study of the initial pulse of <b>cloud</b> <b>flashes</b> against the initial pulse of <b>cloud</b> to ground <b>flashes</b> was conducted. The result suggests that both discharges might have been initiated by similar physical processes inside the thunderclouds. Comparing the features of initial pulse of <b>cloud</b> and ground <b>flashes</b> with that of pulses that appeared in the later stages of <b>cloud</b> <b>flashes</b> suggests that the initiation process involved in both flashes are not very much different from the initiation of <b>cloud</b> <b>flashes</b> at the later stage. The average spectral amplitudes of electric field of full duration <b>cloud</b> <b>flashes</b> (180 ms) showed f  - 1 frequency dependence within the interval of 10 kHz to approximately 10 MHz. This is in contrast to the standard f  - 2 decrement (or even steeper) at high frequency region for other lightning processes such as return strokes. It was suggested that small pulses which repeatedly appeared at the later stage of <b>cloud</b> <b>flashes</b> might have contributed to enhance the spectral amplitude at higher frequencies. Electric fields generated by Narrow Bipolar Pulses (NBPs), which are considered as one of the strongest sources of HF radiation, were measured in the tropics of Malaysia and Sri Lanka.   Their features were also studied and show a good agreement with previously published observations of NBPs from other geographical regions. Thorough analyses and observations of these pulses found previously unreported sharp, fine peaks embedded in the rising and decaying edge of the electric field change of NBPs. Therefore it was suggested that these fine peaks are mostly responsible for the intense HF radiation at 30 MHz...|$|R

The statistics of the optical characteristics of the ground and cloud flashes are inter-compared on an overall basis, and {{as a function of}} ground flash polarity. A standard two-distribution hypothesis test is used to inter-compare the population means of a given lightning parameter for the two flash types.

Following these initial runs of LNOM, the model was updated to include several non-return stroke lightning NOx production mechanisms, and provided the impact of lightning NOx on an August 2006 run of CMAQ. In this study, we review the evolution of the LNOM in greater detail and discuss the model?s latest upgrades and applications.

By using an electric circuit model of the transverse magnetic waves along the return stroke channel, electric currents at ground level as well as cloud level are determined for both the cloud to ground lightning flash and the ground to cloud lightning flash. We show that when an aircraft triggers lightning, the electric currents will be much more severe in current magnitude, rate of rise of currents, and frequency spectrum than otherwise and are more severe than the parameters observed for the usual and well monitored (and measured) cloud to ground (downward leader) flashes. The rate of rise of currents and the frequency spectrum of the ground to cloud lightning flash are also given here.

In a first attempt {{to understand the nature}} of these IC-strokes, 3 D scans from polarimetric high-resolution radar of DLR (POLDIRAD) have been used for comparison, giving verification that the heights coincide with regions of graupel and ice aloft.

It turned out that the emission heights of LINET IC-strokes fit perfectly into channels defined by radio source points from 4 DLSS, no matter whether these channels were located in lower (10 km) altitudes, and independent of whether the discharge was a ground- or a <b>cloud</b> <b>flash.</b> In fact, the accuracy of LINET heights was mostly better than 10...|$|E
40|$|The {{preliminary}} design of an optical/acoustical instrument is described for making highly accurate real-time determinations {{of the location}} of cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning. The instrument, named the Lightning Optical Camera And ThundEr (LOCATE) sensor, will also image the clear and cloud-obscured lightning channel produced from CGs and <b>cloud</b> <b>flashes,</b> and will record the transient optical waveforms produced from these discharges. The LOCATE sensor will consist of a full (360 degrees) field-of-view optical camera for obtaining CG channel image and azimuth, a sensitive thunder microphone for obtaining CG range, and a fast photodiode system for time-resolving the lightning optical waveform. The optical waveform data {{will be used to}} discriminate CGs from <b>cloud</b> <b>flashes.</b> Together, the optical azimuth and thunder range is used to locate CGs and it is anticipated that a network of LOCATE sensors would determine CG source location to well within 100 meters. All of this would be accomplished for a relatively inexpensive cost compared to present RF lightning location technologies, but of course the range detection is limited and will be quantified in the future. The LOCATE sensor technology would have practical applications for electric power utility companies, government (e. g.

A Bayesian inversion method was previously introduced for retrieving the fraction of ground flashes in a set of flashes observed from a satellite lightning imager. The method employed a constrained mixed exponential distribution model to describe the lightning optical measurements. To obtain the optimum model parameters (one of which is the ground flash fraction), a scalar function was minimized by a numerical method. In order to improve this optimization, a Grobner basis solution was introduced to obtain analytic representations of the model parameters that serve as a refined initialization scheme to the numerical optimization.

40|$|As {{the size}} of cloud systems {{and the number of}} hosted VMs rapidly grow, the {{scalability}} of shared VM storage systems becomes a serious issue. Client-side flash-based caching has the potential to improve the performance of cloud VM stor-age by employing flash storage available on the client-side of the storage system to exploit the locality inherent in VM IOs. However, because of the limited capacity and durabil-ity of flash storage, it is important to determine the proper size and configuration of the flash caches used in cloud sys-tems. This paper provides answers to the key design ques-tions of <b>cloud</b> <b>flash</b> caching based on dm-cache, a block-level caching solution customized for cloud environments, and a large amount of long-term traces collected from real-world public and private clouds. The study first validates that cloud workloads have good cacheability and dm-cache-based flash caching incurs low overhead with respect to commod-ity flash devices. It further reveals that write-back caching substantially outperforms write-through caching in typical cloud environments due to the reduction of server IO load. It also shows that there is a tradeoff on making a flash cache persistent across client restarts which saves hours of cache warm-up time but incurs considerable overhead from com-mitting every metadata update persistently. Finally, to re-duce the data loss risk from using write-back caching, the pa-per proposes a new cache-optimized RAID technique, which minimizes the RAID overhead by introducing redundancy of cache dirty data only, and shows to be significantly faster than traditional RAID and write-through caching. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} the CGR 4 {{lightning}} sensor is based on several observed characteristics of the electric field changes caused by nearby lightning, and the radiofrequency noise bursts from lightning. The electric field signals from lightning are detected by a simple aerial, and processed {{by a combination of}} analogue and digital circuitry under microprocessor control to determine if there is a nearby lightning flash, and, if so, to assign the type of flash as negative ground flash (NGF), positive ground flash (PGF), or <b>cloud</b> <b>flash</b> (CF). These types have distinctive features in their electric field change waveforms, enabling an assignment of type of lightning to be made by obtaining several measures of the waveform characteristics and applying an appropriate set of rules. A method of estimating the sensor’s effective range and area has been developed using data for a set of nearby lightning events. This involves the recording of the variation of electric field with time, the response of a lightning sensor, and the distance to the lightning flash using thunder ranging. As the sensor is able to apply different threshold overall field changes for each type of lightning detected, a single effective range of 11. 3 km (effective area 400 km 2) for all types of lightning was achieved by using threshold field changes of 520 volts per metre (V/m) for CF, 760 V/m for NGF, and 1200 V/m for PGF.

Details of the variability of cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning characteristics over the decade 2003 – 12 are provided {{using data from the}} National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN). Changes in total (CG + <b>cloud</b> <b>flash)</b> lightning across part of the CONUS during the decade are provided using satellite Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) data. The variations in NLDN-derived CG lightning are compared with available statistics on lightning-caused impacts to various U. S. economic sectors. Overall, a downward trend in total CG lightning count is found for the decadal period; the 5 -yr mean NLDN CG count decreased by 12. 8 % from 25 204 345. 8 (2003 – 07) to 21 986 578. 8 (2008 – 12). There is a slow upward trend in the fraction and number of positive-polarity CG lightning, however. Associated lightning-caused fatalities and injuries, and the number of lightning-caused wildland fires and burn acreage also trended downward, but crop and personal-property damage costs increased. The 5 -yr mean LIS total lightning changed little over the decadal period. Whereas the CONUS-averaged dry-bulb temperature trended upward during the analysis period, the CONUS-averaged wet-bulb temperature (a variable that is better correlated with lightning activity) trended downward. A simple linear model shows that climate-induced changes in CG lightning frequency would likely have a substantial and direct impact on humankind (e. g., a long-term upward trend of 1 °C in wet-bulb temperature corresponds to approximately 14 fatalities and over $ 367 million in personal-property damage resulting from lightning) ...|$|E
40|$|Observations of {{the light}} {{radiated}} by lightning have been made using high-vacuum phototubes sensitive to light from 300 to 600 nm wavelength. These observations {{were related to the}} charge transported and energy dissipated by lightning flashes to ground. Measurements {{of the light}} radiated by the visible portion of flashes at various distances were normalised using the inverse square law. For ground flashes at a standard distance of 1 km, the median peak light pulse caused a peak photocathode current density of about 1. 7 mA/cm 2 and liberated from the photocathode about 0. 34 microcoulomb/cm 2. The corresponding median peak illumination was about 4 × 105 lux. For 50 per cent of the ground flashes examined, a fraction between about 0. 01 and 0. 03 of the power dissipated in the channel was converted to radiation between 300 and 600 nm. The waveshapes of the light pulses from the component strokes of ground flashes frequently exhibited two peaks a few hundred microseconds apart, and lasted about I msec. A corresponding model lightning stroke current waveshape with two current impulse components is suggested. The ratio of the peak rate to the mean rate of emission of light was measured for all types of lightning flash. The median value of this ratio was found to be 1400 for ground flashes and 150 for <b>cloud</b> <b>flashes,</b> indicating that impulsive discharge processes are less important in <b>cloud</b> <b>flashes</b> than ground flashes...|$|R

Production of NOx by a segment of a lightning channel is a function of channel segment energy density and channel segment altitude. A first estimate of NOx production by a lightning flash can be found by multiplying production per segment [typically 104 J/m; Hill (1979) ] by the total length of the flash s channel.

The analysis was conducted only on the first electric field pulse for each lightning process and the output from the wavelet {{transformation is}} plotted as normalized power spectrum. The first pulses in CG− are found to radiate intensely in average frequency between 186 and 1637 kHz. The energy radiated by the first pulses of CG+ mainly concentrated in the average frequency between 57 and 599 kHz. As for the IC, the first pulses found to be spread out in the average frequency between 461 and 3570 kHz and for IB, the energy spread out between 44 and 279 kHz. The CG+ and IB flashes tend to radiate at lower frequency region within smaller range compared to CG− and IC. IB has the smallest frequency range around 235 kHz while the frequency range of IC and CG− are more than 10 times and 6 times larger than IB, respectively. Furthermore, IC and CG− have comparable initial-to-overshoot peak ratio with 1. 7 and 1. 6, respectively, which higher than CG+ and IB at least with a factor of 1. 4.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{estimate}} the fraction of ground flashes {{in a set of}} flashes observed by a satellite lightning imager, such as the future GOES-R Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM), would likely improve operational and scientific applications (e. g., severe weather warnings, lightning nitrogen oxides studies, and global electric circuit analyses). A Bayesian inversion method, called the Ground Flash Fraction Retrieval Algorithm (GoFFRA), was recently developed for estimating the ground flash fraction. The method uses a constrained mixed exponential distribution model to describe a particular lightning optical measurement called the Maximum Group Area (MGA). To obtain the optimum model parameters (one of which is the desired ground flash fraction), a scalar function must be minimized. This minimization is difficult because of two problems: (1) Label Switching (LS), and (2) Parameter Identity Theft (PIT). The LS problem is well known in the literature on mixed exponential distributions, and the PIT problem was discovered in this study. Each problem occurs when one allows the numerical minimizer to freely roam through the parameter search space; this allows certain solution parameters to interchange roles which leads to fundamental ambiguities, and solution error. A major accomplishment {{of this study is that}} we have employed a state-of-the-art genetic-based global optimization algorithm called Differential Evolution (DE) that constrains the parameter search in such a way as to remove both the LS and PIT problems. To test the performance of the GoFFRA when DE is employed, we applied it to analyze simulated MGA datasets that we generated from known mixed exponential distributions. Moreover, we evaluated the GoFFRA/DE method by applying it to analyze actual MGAs derived from low-Earth orbiting lightning imaging sensor data; the actual MGA data were classified as either ground or <b>cloud</b> <b>flash</b> MGAs using National Lightning Detection Network[TM] (NLDN) data.

40|$|Temporal and wavelet {{characteristics}} of initial breakdown pulses are meticulously studied {{especially during the}} earliest moment of lightning events. Any possible features during the earliest moment that may exist which lead to either negative cloud-to-ground (CG), positive cloud-to-ground, cloud or isolated breakdown flashes in Sweden are investigated. Moreover, the occurrence of narrow bipolar pulses (NBPs) {{as part of a}} CG event that has been recorded from tropical thunderstorms are also included in the investigation. Electric field signatures selected from a collection of waveforms recorded using fast electric field broadband antenna system installed in Uppsala, Sweden and Skudai, South Malaysia are then carefully analyzed in order to observe any similarities or/and differences of their features. Temporal analysis reveals that there are significant distinctions within the first 1 ms among different types of lightning flashes. It is found that a negative CG flash tends to radiate pulses more frequently than other flashes and a <b>cloud</b> <b>flash</b> tends to radiate shorter pulses than other flashes but less frequently when compared to negative CG and isolated breakdown flashes. Perhaps, the ionization process during the earliest moment of negative CG flashes is more rapid than other discharges. Using a wavelet transformation, it can be suggested that the first electric field pulse of both negative CG and cloud flashes experiences a more rapid and extensive ionization process compared to positive CG and isolated breakdown flashes. Further temporal analysis on NBPs found to occur as part of CG flashes show the disparity of the normalized electric field amplitude between the NBPs prior to and after the first return stroke. This indicates that the NBPs intensities were influenced by the return stroke events and they occurred in the same thundercloud. The similarity between the temporal {{characteristics of}} NBPs as part of CG flashes and isolated NBPs suggests that their breakdown mechanisms might be similar...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, the {{features}} of electric field signatures of narrow bipolar pulses (NBPs) generated by <b>cloud</b> <b>flashes</b> are investigated and their effects on wireless communication systems are studied. A handful amount of NBPs (14. 5 %) have been observed to occur as part of cloud-to-ground flashes in South Malaysia. Occurrence of NBPs in Sweden has been reported {{for the first time}} in this thesis. The electric field waveform characteristics of NBPs as part of cloud-to-ground flashes were similar to isolated NBPs found in Sweden and South Malaysia and also to those isolated NBPs reported by previous studies from various geographical areas. This is a strong indication that their breakdown mechanisms are similar at any latitudes regardless of geographical areas. A comparative study on the occurrence of NBPs and other forms of lightning flashes across various geographical areas ranging from northern regions to the tropics is presented. As the latitude decreased from Uppsala, Sweden (59. 8 °N) to South Malaysia (1. 5 °N), the percentage of NBP emissions relative to the total number of lightning flashes increased significantly from 0. 13 % to 12 %. Occurrences of positive NBPs were more common than negative NBPs at all observed latitudes. However, as latitudes decreased, the negative NBP emissions increased significantly from 20 % (Sweden) to 45 % (South Malaysia). Factors involving mixed-phase region elevations and vertical extents of thundercloud tops are invoked to explain the observed results. These factors are fundamentally latitude dependent.

The interest for minimizing the negative consequences associated with LNG terminals has emerged by focusing on the potential damages that may be generated by the flammable and cryogenic characteristics of LNG such as vapor <b>cloud,</b> <b>flash</b> fires, and pool fires. LNG research and regulation have been successfully applied for providing safer conditions at the LNG import terminals. However, the integration of export terminals into the existing LNG network requires a thorough revision of the new challenges imposed by the specific conditions related to the liquefaction facilities. It is intended to determine the exclusion zones for these two particular scenarios through the utilization of PHAST in order to estimate the areas where people, property, or the environment would be more severely affected. A revision about the parameters proposed by the normativity for the estimation of the exclusion zones, in contrast to the particular conditions that might affect the plants located on coastal areas is performed. Additionally, this project seeks to integrate the predicted consequences into real world scenarios by including the implementation of a Geographic Information System (GIS). The georeferenced data will to identify the potential vulnerable areas located near to the LNG facilities. The main goal intended in this project by the combination of these two computational tools (PHAST model and GIS) is to reduce the gap between the consequence estimation of LNG catastrophic events and the incorporation of these results in a real world environment...|$|E
40|$|As {{the size}} of cloud systems {{and the number of}} hosted virtual {{machines}} (VMs) rapidly grow, the scalability of shared VM storage systems becomes a serious issue. Client-side flash-based caching has the potential to improve the performance of cloud VM storage by employing flash storage available on the VM hosts to exploit the locality inherent in VM IOs. However, there are several challenges to the effective use of flash caching in cloud systems. First, cache configurations such as size, write policy, metadata persistency and RAID level have significant impacts on flash caching. Second, the typical capacity of flash devices is limited compared to the dataset size of consolidated VMs. Finally, flash devices wear out and face serious endurance issues which are aggravated by the use for caching. ^ This dissertation presents the research for addressing these problems of <b>cloud</b> <b>flash</b> caching in the following three aspects. First, it presents a thorough study of different cache configurations including a new cache-optimized RAID configuration using a large amount of long-term traces collected from real-world public and private clouds. Second, it studies an on-demand flash cache management solution for meeting VM cache demands and minimizing device wear-out. It uses a new cache demand model Reuse Working Set (RWS) to capture the data with good temporal locality, and uses the RWS size (RWSS) to model a workload?s cache demand. Finally, to handle situations where a cache is insufficient for VMs? demands, it employs dynamic cache migration to balance cache load across hosts by live migrating cached data along with the VMs. ^ The results show that the cache-optimized RAID improves performance by 137 % without sacrificing reliability, compared to traditional RAID. The RWSS-based on-demand cache allocation reduces workload?s cache usage by 78 % and lowers the amount of writes sent to cache device by 40 %, compared to traditional working set based cache allocation. Combining on-demand cache allocation with dynamic cache migration for 12 concurrent VMs, results show 28 % higher hit ratio and 28 % lower 90 th percentile IO latency, compared to the case without cache allocation. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{worldwide}} {{survey of}} the ratio of cloud flashes to ground flashes in thunderstorms using CGR 3 (Cloud-Ground Ratio # 3) instruments at sites covering a latitude range from 59. 9 ° N to 27. 3 ° S between 1986 and 1991 inclusive has provided information on the latitudinal variation of total flash density and the ratio of cloud flashes to total flashes. Two surveys of global lightning occurrence using satellites, the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) survey using optical sensors to detect lightning at near local midnight and the Ionospheric Sounding Satellite-b (ISS-b) survey using radio-frequency lightning detection equipment, were {{used in conjunction with}} the CGR 3 observations to obtain the latitudinal variation of total flash density over each major land mass and each major ocean. These three surveys and other sources provided data on the annual and diurnal variation in lightning occurrence at various latitudes. We have combined the above information in a computational model of global lightning occurrence and have separated total flashes into <b>cloud</b> <b>flash</b> and ground flash components. Using this model, we estimate the global annual number of total flashes to be 2. 05 × 109 yr- 1, corresponding to a mean rate of 65 s- 1. This estimate is probably low because of inadequate detection of weak cloud flashes. Depending on the assumption made concerning the latitudinal variation of the ratio of cloud flashes to total flashes, the mean rates of occurrence are between about 51 s- 1 and 55 s- 1 for cloud flashes and between about 10 s- 1 and 14 s- 1 for ground flashes. The uncertainty in these estimates is a factor of 2 in either direction. The calculated global diurnal variation has a peak rate of occurrence of about 1. 6 times the mean rate at about 1400 universal time (UT) in the northern hemisphere spring and has its lowest rate of about 0. 5 times the mean rate at about 0300 UT in the northern hemisphere summer. About 54 % of all lightning occurs in the northern hemisphere. The mean global land total flash density is about 8. 3 km- 2 yr- 1. This is about 3. 4 times the mean global total flash density over oceans. Copyright 1998 by the American Geophysical Union...|$|E

40|$|A Bayesian {{inversion}} {{method was}} previously introduced for retrieving {{the fraction of}} ground flashes {{in a set of}} flashes observed from a (low earth orbiting or geostationary) satellite lightning imager. The method employed a constrained mixed exponential distribution model to describe the lightning optical measurements. To obtain the optimum model parameters, a scalar function was minimized by a numerical method. In order to improve this optimization, we introduce a Grobner basis solution to obtain analytic representations of the model parameters that serve as a refined initialization scheme to the numerical optimization. Using the Grobner basis, we show that there are exactly 2 solutions involving the first 3 moments of the (exponentially distributed) data. When the mean of the ground flash optical characteristic (e. g., such as the Maximum Group Area, MGA) is larger than that for <b>cloud</b> <b>flashes,</b> then a unique solution can be obtained...|$|R

The algorithm is required {{as part of a}} broader objective that involves improving the lightning NOx emission inventories of both regional air quality and global chemistry/climate models. The algorithm was tested and applied to VHF signals detected by the North Alabama Lightning Mapping Array (NALMA). The accuracy of the algorithm was characterized by comparing algorithm output to the plots of individual discharges whose lengths were computed by hand; VHF source amplitude thresholding and smoothing were applied to optimize results. Several thousands of lightning flashes within 120 km of the NALMA network centroid were gathered from all four seasons, and were analyzed by the algorithm. The mean, standard deviation, and median statistics were obtained for all the flashes, the ground <b>flashes,</b> and the <b>cloud</b> <b>flashes.</b> One-meter channel segment altitude distributions were also obtained for the different seasons...|$|R
