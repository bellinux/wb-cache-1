The most satisfactory results from <b>cuttings</b> can be achieved by using tip growth, taken six weeks after the cessation of flowering, and kept under a fogging system for twenty weeks.

5|$|P.atriplicifolia is {{frequently}} propagated by <b>cuttings.</b> Because its woody crown is resistant to division, softwood <b>cuttings</b> {{are taken from}} shoots near the base, generally in late spring. Hardwood <b>cuttings</b> selected in mid-to-late summer also provide a viable propagation technique. The plant is also grown from seed in cultivation. Such seeds require exposure to cold for 30–160 days to germinate, and seed-raised specimens may not preserve the characteristics of named cultivars. In the commercial greenhouse or nursery setting, P.atriplicifolia relatively large size and rapid growth can adversely affect quality or make plants more difficult and expensive to transport; the use of plant growth regulators such as chlormequat chloride and daminozide may be more cost-effective than large-scale pruning.|$|E

5|$|X. bracteatum {{is easy to}} grow {{both from}} seeds and from <b>cuttings,</b> {{although}} named cultivars only grow true from <b>cuttings.</b> Plants benefit from pruning of old growth in winter to allow for new growth in spring. Dead-heading, or pruning off old flower heads, promotes the production of more flowers. Fresh seeds germinate in 3 to 20days and require no special treatment. Plants grow best in acid, well-aerated soils of pH5.5 to 6.3, {{with low levels of}} phosphorus. They are sensitive to iron deficiency, which presents as yellowing (chlorosis) of the youngest leaves while the leaf veins remain green.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{based on}} finite element {{software}} DEFORM, {{the model of}} a large <b>cutting</b> depth and quasi-high speeds milling of titanium alloys is built to study the <b>cutting</b> temperature and <b>cutting</b> force variation along with the change of <b>cutting</b> parameters. The simulation results show that: {{the location of the}} maximum <b>cutting</b> temperature appears in the <b>cutting</b> edges of the tool nose circular profile. Meanwhile, due to workpiece material rebound in the <b>cutting</b> process, the interface between workpiece and tool flank face occurs serious extrusion, which results in relatively high <b>cutting</b> temperature on the workpiece machined surface. In addition, <b>cutting</b> speed and feed rate per tooth {{play a key role in}} influencing the <b>cutting</b> temperature. However, the influence of <b>cutting</b> depth on the <b>cutting</b> temperature is less clear. With the increase in the feed rate and <b>cutting</b> depth, <b>cutting</b> force increased significantly.

5|$|Droseraregia {{is often}} {{described}} as being a difficult species to cultivate, though modern reports on its cultivation have indicated which conditions have led to success for some. For optimal growth, D.regia appears to require good soil drainage and sufficient light levels, and prefers cooler temperatures. Cool nights and warm days have been reported to induce vigorous growth. Asexual propagation is frequently achieved through small root <b>cuttings</b> instead of leaf <b>cuttings,</b> which tend to rot before roots can form. Seed germination occurs as early as 10 days to 3 or 4 weeks with fresh seed, faster than many other Drosera species. Germination is phanerocotylar (non-glandular cotyledons exposed, free from seed coverings), with the first true leaves being alternate in arrangement.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This study {{investigated}} phenomena of ultrasonic <b>cutting</b> {{in the case}} of high-speed conditions. Ultrasonically assisted <b>cutting</b> techniques were developed by Kumabe in the 1950 s. He found a “critical <b>cutting</b> speed ” that limits <b>cutting</b> speed to obtain ultrasonically assisted effects and is calculated by frequency and amplitude of oscillation. In general, ultrasonically assisted <b>cutting</b> is not suitable for high-speed <b>cutting</b> conditions because the effects of ultrasonic application are cancelled due to tool contacts with the workpiece during the <b>cutting</b> operation. Present ultrasonically assisted <b>cutting</b> cannot allow increased <b>cutting</b> speed because <b>cutting</b> speed is limited by a critical <b>cutting</b> speed that is less than that compared with general <b>cutting</b> speed. And ultrasonically assisted <b>cutting</b> cannot improve productivity due to long processing time. We conducted high-speed ultrasonic <b>cutting,</b> and the maximum <b>cutting</b> speed in this research was 300 m/min which is higher than general critical <b>cutting</b> speed. The workpiece material was A 5056 and cemented carbide tool inserts were employed in this research. Without ultrasonic oscillation, machined surface retained some built up edge and surface roughness is 28 µmRz. In the case of ultrasonic <b>cutting,</b> surface hasn’t built up edge and periodically marks due to ultrasonic oscillation remained on the surface. The roughness of conventionally cut surface is better than in ultrasonic <b>cutting.</b> The <b>cutting</b> phenomena of ultrasonic <b>cutting</b> are different compared with those under conventional <b>cutting</b> conditions...|$|R

40|$|The <b>cutting</b> force, the {{reaction}} {{force of the}} workpiece being cut by tool, needs to investigate of machine rigidity, machinability, tool life and <b>cutting</b> power etc. The force involves the three forces; the main <b>cutting</b> force P₁, the feed <b>cutting</b> force P₂, and the thrust <b>cutting</b> force P₃. The main <b>cutting</b> force P₁ is maximam value, and the <b>cutting</b> power is almost decided by the <b>cutting</b> force P₁, however the deformation of machine tool and workpiece are tightly related to the three forces.

For {{economical}} {{and environmental}} reasons, {{the aim of}} this research is hence to monitor the <b>cutting</b> conditions with the dry <b>cutting,</b> the wet <b>cutting,</b> and the mist <b>cutting</b> to obtain the proper <b>cutting</b> condition for the plain carbon steel with the ball end milling based on the consideration of the surface roughness of the machined parts, the life of the <b>cutting</b> tools, the use of the <b>cutting</b> fluids, the density of the particles of <b>cutting</b> fluids dispersed in the working area, and the cost of <b>cutting.</b> The experimentally obtained results of the relation between tool wear and surface roughness, the relation between tool wear and <b>cutting</b> force, and the relation between <b>cutting</b> force and surface roughness are correspondent with the same trend. The phenomena of surface roughness and tool wear {{can be explained by the}} in-process <b>cutting</b> forces. The models of the tool wear with the <b>cutting</b> conditions and the <b>cutting</b> times are proposed to estimate the tool cost for the different cooling strategies based on the experimental data using the multiple regression technique. The <b>cutting</b> cost is calculated from the costs of <b>cutting</b> tool and <b>cutting</b> fluid. The mist <b>cutting</b> gives the lowest <b>cutting</b> cost as compared to others.

It has been grown outdoors in southern England, particularly G. juniperina subspecies sulphurea. Grevillea juniperina adapts easily to cultivation and {{grows in a}} wide range of soils and aspects in locations with good drainage. Long-flowering, it attracts birds such as honeyeaters with its nectar. The prickly dense foliage is also a good nesting site and shelter, particularly for smaller birds, such as finches. Many forms and hybrids have been commercially propagated and sold, some having more horticultural appeal than others.
