5|$|Hugh was {{the nephew}} of {{brothers}} King Stephen of England and Henry of Blois, born as the younger son of Hugh III, lord of Puiset and Agnes, sister of Stephen and Henry. Agnes' parents were Stephen, Count of Blois and Adela, a daughter of King William the Conqueror. His paternal family held a lordship in Northern France. Hugh was born in approximately 1125, for in 1153 with his election as bishop he was still under the <b>canonical</b> <b>age</b> limit for bishops of 28. Henry acquired for Hugh the office of archdeacon in the see of Winchester, sometime before 1139.|$|E
5|$|When Bede {{was about}} 17 years old, Adomnán, the abbot of Iona Abbey, visited Monkwearmouth and Jarrow. Bede would {{probably}} have met the abbot during this visit, {{and it may be}} that Adomnan sparked Bede's interest in the Easter dating controversy. In about 692, in Bede's nineteenth year, Bede was ordained a deacon by his diocesan bishop, John, who was bishop of Hexham. The <b>canonical</b> <b>age</b> for the ordination of a deacon was 25; Bede's early ordination may mean that his abilities were considered exceptional, but it is also possible that the minimum age requirement was often disregarded. There might have been minor orders ranking below a deacon; but there is no record of whether Bede held any of these offices. In Bede's thirtieth year (about 702), he became a priest, with the ordination again performed by Bishop John.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey was Archdeacon of Lincoln in {{the diocese}} of Lincoln by September 1171, and {{probably}} retained that office until he was confirmed as bishop-elect in 1175. He also held a prebend, an income from land owned by a cathedral chapter, in {{the diocese of}} London, {{but there is little}} evidence that he executed the duties of either office. There are some indications that he studied canon law at a school in Northampton, and that he taught in Paris during the early 1170s. He also acted as a papal judge-delegate at that time. Pope Alexander III initially refused to confirm Geoffrey's selection as Bishop of Lincoln in about May 1173, prompting Geoffrey to travel to Rome in October 1174 to secure confirmation of this office. He was confirmed in the office of bishop by July 1175, but he was not ordained at that time, as he was under the <b>canonical</b> <b>age</b> for holding a bishopric. Geoffrey's youth was one of Alexander's objections to Geoffrey's election, and the pope only confirmed the office under duress. Another potential problem was Geoffrey's illegitimacy, which normally disbarred a person from holding ecclesiastical office, but that was dealt with by the granting of a papal dispensation.|$|E

40|$|Evidence of a {{supernova}} event, discussed in Wallner et al., {{was discovered in}} the deep-sea crusts with two signals dating back to 2 - 3 and 7 - 9 Myr ago. In this contribution, we place constraints on the birth-site of the supernova progenitors from the ejecta timeline, the initial mass function, and the ages of nearby stellar groups. We investigated the Scorpius-Centaurus OB Association, the nearest site of recent massive star formation, and the moving group Tucana-Horologium. Using the known stellar mass of the remaining massive stars within these subgroups and factoring in travel time for the ejecta, we have constrained the ages and masses of the supernova progenitors by using the initial mass function and then compared the results to the <b>canonical</b> <b>ages</b> of each subgroup. Our results identify the Upper Scorpius and Lower Centaurus-Crux subgroups as unlikely birth-sites for these supernovae. We find that Tucana-Horologium is the likely birth-site of the supernova 7 - 9 Myr ago and Upper Centaurus-Lupus is the likely birth-site for the supernova 2 - 3 Myr ago.

25|$|Fisher {{studied at}} the University of Cambridge from 1484, where at Michaelhouse he came under the {{influence}} of William Melton, a pastorally-minded theologian open to the new current of reform in studies arising from the Renaissance. Fisher earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1487 and in 1491, proceeded to a Master of Arts degree. Also in 1491 Fisher received a papal dispensation to enter the priesthood despite being under <b>canonical</b> <b>age.</b> Fisher was ordained into the Catholic priesthood on 17 December 1491 - the same year that he was elected a fellow of his college. He was also made Vicar of Northallerton, Yorkshire. In 1494 he resigned his benefice to become proctor of the university and three years later was appointed master debator, about which date he also became chaplain and confessor to Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby, mother of King Henry VII. On 5 July 1501, he became a doctor of sacred theology and 10 days later was elected Vice-Chancellor of the University. Under Fisher's guidance, his patroness Lady Margaret founded St John's and Christ's Colleges at Cambridge, and a Lady Margaret Professorship of Divinity at each of the two universities at Oxford and Cambridge, Fisher himself becoming the first occupant of the Cambridge chair. In the years from 1505 to 1508 he was also the President of Queens' College. At the end of July 1516 he was at Cambridge for the opening of St John's College and consecrated the chapel.|$|E

2500|$|Isabella {{was born}} in Paris on an {{uncertain}} date– {{on the basis of}} the chroniclers and the eventual date of her marriage, she was probably born between May and November 1295. She is described as born in 1292 in the Annals of Wigmore, and Piers Langtoft agrees, claiming that she was 7 years old in 1299. The French chroniclers Guillaume de Nangis and Thomas Walsingham describe her as 12 years old at the time of her marriage in January 1308, placing her birth between January 1295 and of 1296. A papal dispensation by Clement V in November 1305 permitted her immediate marriage by proxy, despite the fact that she was probably only 10 years old. Since she had to reach the <b>canonical</b> <b>age</b> of 7 before her betrothal in May 1303, and that of 12 before her marriage in January 1308, the evidence suggests that she was born between May and November 1295.

2500|$|On 1 February 1736 {{the tenth}} Lord Derby {{died and the}} lordship of Man passed to James Murray, 2nd Duke of Atholl. The {{revision}} of statutes proposed in 1725 was at once carried through, with the result of [...] "a marked absence of disputes between the civil and ecclesiastical courts". The intricate suit about impropriations (to all of which Atholl had a legal claim) jeopardised for a time the temporalities of the church, and was not finally settled till 7 July 1757 after Wilson's death. [...] In 1737, {{with the aid of}} Sir Joseph Jekyll, Wilson and his son were able to recover certain deeds securing to the clergy an equivalent for their tithe. Between Wilson and Atholl (and the governors of his appointment) there seems never to have been any personal friction. Under the revised ecclesiastical law presentments for moral offences were less frequent, procedure being less summary. But, while health lasted, Wilson was sedulous in administering the discipline through the spiritual courts, and there was an increase of clerical cases. The extreme difficulty of obtaining suitable candidates for the miserably poor paying benefices led Wilson to get leave from the archbishop of York to ordain before the <b>canonical</b> <b>age.</b>|$|E
40|$|This second article concludes the author's {{study of}} {{memorial}} monuments {{by considering the}} decisive role played in their historical metamorphosis by architectural models. These can he identified as archetypes which, through the successive <b>canonical</b> <b>ages</b> of Western civilisation, distinguish the motifs and iconography of the Egyptians, the Greeks, the Romans and of Christianity in the broadest sense, {{up to and including}} post Illuminist paradigms. The analysis leads to the ascertaining of a metahistorical persistence of architectural and figurative models - as described by H. Focillon - until the mid- 20 th century, albeit in a contextual transformation of continually altered symbolic values. Such alterations are indeed intrinsic to the meaning but not to the medium: man is always represented in his epic, saintly or heroic personae through painting and sculpture combined with architecture. The contemporary era, on the other hand, seems close to oriental models in omitting to depict itself on its own monuments, omitting, too, in the process the high ethical and moral value that such defections have for the education of peoples.

50|$|There is {{a special}} service for the tonsuring of a subdeacon, {{although}} in contemporary practice an acolyte or a reader may receive the bishop's blessing to vest and act as a subdeacon generally or for a particular occasion {{if there is no}} subdeacon available. This situation often arises if {{there is a need for}} a subdeacon and a likely candidate has stated an intention to marry but has not yet done so, causing a delay in his ordination. The reason for this lies in the fact that the canons prohibit subdeacons to marry after their ordination (just like deacons and priests). This latter stipulation has led, in some places, to the reservation of the formal ordination service as a stepping-stone for candidates for the priesthood, although this is by no means universal. It also means that, while teenagers who show particular fervour may be ordained as acolytes and readers, the subdiaconate is usually reserved for those of more mature years; the <b>canonical</b> minimum <b>age</b> for subdiaconal ordination is twenty years.|$|R

50|$|In these traditions, {{only men}} who meet certain {{requirements}} may become priests. In Roman Catholicism the <b>canonical</b> minimum <b>age</b> is twenty-five. Bishops may dispense with this rule and ordain men {{up to one}} year younger. Dispensations {{of more than a}} year are reserved to the Holy See (Can. 1031 §§1, 4.)

In Orthodoxy, the normal minimum age is thirty (Can. 9 of Neocaesarea) but a bishop may dispense with this if needed. In neither tradition may priests marry after ordination. In the Roman Catholic Church, priests in the Latin Rite, which covers the vast majority of Roman Catholicism, must be celibate except under special rules for married clergy converting from certain other Christian confessions. Married men may become priests in Eastern Orthodoxy and the Eastern Catholic Churches, but in neither case may they marry after ordination, even if they become widowed.

We find that <b>canonical</b> Zero <b>Age</b> Horizontal Branches with metallicity larger or {{of the order of}} Z= 0. 002 should be all affected by a tilt, by an amount which increases when the metallicity is increased and/or the mixing length is decreased, reaching a tilt of Δ V ∼ 0. 2 mag in the case of solar metallicity when a mixing length value α= 1. 6 is assumed (Δ V is the magnitude difference between the top of the blue HB and the fainter magnitude reached by the red HB). Uncertainties in the luminosity of the red HB due to uncertainty in the mixing length value are discussed. We finally discuss the much larger tilt observed in the clusters NGC 6441 and NGC 6388, reporting additional evidence against suggested non-canonical evolutionary scenarios. Numerical experiments show that differential reddening could produce such sloped HBs. Further, HST-PC imaging of NGC 6441 gives clear indications about the occurrence of differential reddening across the cluster. However, the same imaging shows that the observed slope of the red HB is not an artifact of differential reddening.
