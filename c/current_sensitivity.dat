40|$|In this work, we {{investigate}} how {{the sensitivity of}} a nanowire or nanoribbon sensor {{is influenced by the}} subthreshold slope of the sensing transistor. Polysilicon nanoribbon sensors are fabricated {{with a wide range of}} subthreshold slopes and the sensitivity is characterized using pH measurements. It is shown that there is a strong relationship between the sensitivity and the device subthreshold slope. The sensitivity is characterized using the <b>current</b> <b>sensitivity</b> per pH, which is shown to increase from 1. 2 % ph− 1 to 33. 6 % ph− 1 as the subthreshold slope improves from 6. 2 V dec− 1 to 0. 23 V dec− 1 respectively. We propose a model that relates <b>current</b> <b>sensitivity</b> per pH to the subthreshold slope of the sensing transistor. The model shows that sensitivity is determined only on the subthreshold slope of the sensing transistor and the choice of gate insulator. The model fully explains the values of <b>current</b> <b>sensitivity</b> per pH for the broad range of subthreshold slopes obtained in our fabricated nanoribbon devices. It is also able to explain values of sensitivity reported in the literature, which range from 2. 5 % pH− 1 to 650 % pH− 1 for a variety of nanoribbon and nanowire sensors. Furthermore, it shows that aggressive device scaling is not the key to high sensitivity.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that polarimetric interferometry {{can be used}} to extract precise spatial information about compact polarized flares of Sgr A*. We show that, for a faint dynamical component, a single interferometric baseline suffices to determine both its polarization and projected displacement from the quiescent intensity centroid.

We apply this technique to simulated 1. 3 -mm wavelength observations of a "hot spot" embedded in a radiatively inefficient accretion disk around Sgr A*. Our results indicate that, even with <b>current</b> <b>sensitivities,</b> polarimetric interferometry with the Event Horizon Telescope can achieve ~ 5 microarcsecond relative astrometry of compact flaring structures near Sgr A* on timescales of minutes.
