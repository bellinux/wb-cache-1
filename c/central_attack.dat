2500|$|Since 1932 Polish cryptanalysts Marian Rejewski, Jerzy Różycki and Henryk Zygalski from Polish Cipher Bureau were {{breaking}} German Enigma messages. Their effort allowed Poles to build replicas of German machines in Warsaw for Polish secret service. Just before war, in 1939, Polish secret service revealed {{their work to}} French and English allies on a secret meeting on 26 and 27 July 1939, in Pyry near Warsaw. Later during the war, thousands {{of men and women}} were working on the project by the time the war ended in 1945. The computing advances did not obviate the need for human labor, as the many teams of largely female operators certainly knew. [...] Throughout the war, there were breakthroughs and setbacks when the design or use of the German Enigma machines was changed and the Bletchley Park code breakers had to adapt.Moreover, the breakthrough depicted in the film provides the impression that first the Bombe was developed, then only became effective after it was later realised that deciphering could be made easier by looking for known or speculated items contained in an intercepted message, a practice known in cryptanalysis as employing a crib. However, in reality, the opposite is true; the use of cribs was the <b>central</b> <b>attack</b> model upon which the Bombe's principal design was based, rather than being an afterthought to the design.|$|E
