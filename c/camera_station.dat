40|$|Groundfish that {{associate}} with rugged seafloor types {{are difficult to}} assess with bottom-trawl sampling gear. Simrad ME 70 multibeam echosounder (MBES) data and video imagery were collected to characterize trawlable and untrawlable areas, and to ultimately improve efforts to determine habitat-specific groundfish biomass. The data were collected during two acoustic-trawl surveys of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) during 2011 and 2012 by NOAA Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) researchers. MBES data were collected continuously along the trackline, which included parallel transects (1 - 20 nmi spacing) and fine-scale survey locations in 2011. Video data were collected at <b>camera</b> <b>stations</b> using a drop camera system. Multibeamderived seafloor metrics were overlaid with the locations of previously conducted AFSC bottomtrawl (BT) survey hauls and 2011 <b>camera</b> <b>stations.</b> Generalized linear models were used to identify the best combination of multibeam metrics to discriminate between trawlable and untrawlable seafloor for the region of overlap between the <b>camera</b> <b>stations</b> or haul paths and the MBES data. The most discriminatory models were chosen based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC). The two best models were developed using data collected at <b>camera</b> <b>stations</b> with either oblique incidence backscatter strength (Sb) or mosaic Sb in combination with bathymetric position index and seafloor ruggedness and described over 54...|$|R

The use of wildlife cameras to discover dispersing raccoon dogs have been implemented in the north-European raccoon dog management program. In this study, I test the ability of four commercially available scent lures to attract raccoon dogs to <b>camera</b> <b>stations.</b> The study was conducted in the Åland Islands where raccoon dogs are abundant and the results could improve the effectiveness of the <b>camera</b> <b>stations</b> used in the program. I used 12 sites with five <b>camera</b> <b>stations</b> in each and tested the four lures and one control with no lure in each site. The stations were baited and left undisturbed for a minimum of 11 days. The cameras recorded 18 raccoon dogs distributed over 11 stations and 5 sites. No statistical significant difference (Kruskal-Wallis test) was found between treatments, probably because of the low number of detected raccoon dogs. I believe however the method is useful to detect presence of raccoon dog and the results should give some indications about which lures are most effective...|$|R

40|$|Reliable {{population}} estimation techniques for cryptic forest predators generally are lacking. Development of an efficient and reliable technique to estimate predator abundance directly {{would be a}} valuable tool for wildlife managers concerned with predator management. We evaluated the potential for camera survey techniques to provide abundance estimates for bobcats (Lynx rufus) in southeastern forest habitats. We also determined our ability to capture other forest carnivores photographically using these techniques. We used TrailMaster 1500 active infrared-triggered cameras to estimate abundance on a 1318 -ha private land holding in eastern Texas. <b>Camera</b> <b>stations</b> were located along roads and wildlife travel corridors using a 65 -ha block grid overlaying the property. We established 20 <b>camera</b> <b>stations</b> yielding a mean coverage of approximately 1 camera/ 65. 9 ha. All <b>camera</b> <b>stations</b> were baited with bobcat urine and a visual attractant and monitored for 12 weeks. We recorded 15 bobcat photographic events of seven separate individuals that were identified using spot pattern and other distinctive markings. These data were used to derive a population abundance estimate of seven bobcats during the 12 -week study period using the computer program CAPTURE. This corresponded to a density of 0. 29 – 0. 58 bobcats/km 2, which compared favorably with other studies conducted in similar habitats. In addition to providing a monitoring technique for bobcats, photographic survey techniques could be adapted for monitoring other cryptic carnivores...|$|R
40|$|Linear array CCD-based {{panoramic}} cameras have a {{high potential}} for measurement applications due to their design in acquiring 360 degree field of views and high information content with up to a Giga-pixel image data in one scan. The best possible accuracy of such a system {{can be obtained by}} a suitable sensor model and by establishing an optimal network following the concept of network design. The influence of different network configurations on the object point coordinates precision was shown in our previous studies with networks of panoramic cameras and panoramic and matrix array CCD cameras. In this paper, the influence of different network configurations onto the determination of Additional Parameters (APs) for self-calibration is demonstrated. The accuracy and precision values of object points and the correlations of APs with respect to the object point coordinates and the exterior orientation parameters are analyzed. By computer simulation and some sensor assumptions, networks of leveled and tilted panoramic <b>camera</b> <b>stations,</b> at the same and at different heights, are analyzed. The datum choice in all network cases is the “free network”, based on the concept of inner constraints. We show that by increasing the tilt of <b>camera</b> <b>stations</b> the correlations of parameters are decreasing, especially the correlations of APs with object space coordinates. Based on these results we suggest tilted panoramic <b>camera</b> <b>stations</b> for the purpose of self-calibration. 1...|$|R
50|$|In optical tracking, the {{satellite}} {{can be used}} as a very high target for triangulation and can be used to ascertain the geometric relationship between multiple observing stations. Optical tracking with the BC-4, PC-1000, MOTS, or Baker Nunn cameras consisted of photographic observations of a satellite, or flashing light on {{the satellite}}, against a background of stars. The stars, whose positions were accurately determined, provided a framework on the photographic plate or film for a determination of precise directions from <b>camera</b> <b>station</b> to satellite. Geodetic positioning work with cameras was usually performed with one camera observing simultaneously with one or more other cameras. Camera systems are weather dependent and that is one major reason why they fell out of use by the 1980s.|$|E

The U.S. Air Force had ten Baker-Nunn camera stations around the world mostly from 1960 to 1977 with a phase-out beginning in 1964. The Baker-Nunn space <b>camera</b> <b>station</b> was constructed on Sand Island and was functioning by 1965. USAF 18th Surveillance Squadron operated the Baker-Nunn camera at a station built along the causeway on Sand Island until 1975 when a contract to operate the four remaining Air Force stations was awarded to Bendix Field Engineering Corporation. In about 1977, the camera at Sand Island was moved to Daegu, South Korea. Baker-Nunn were rendered obsolete with the IOC of 3 GEODSS optical tracking sites at Daegu, Korea; Mount Haleakala, Maui and White Sands Missile Range. A fourth site was operational in 1985 at Diego Garcia and a proposed fifth site in Portugal was cancelled. The Daegu, Korea site was closed due to encroaching city lights. GEODSS tracked satellites at night, though the MIT Lincoln Laboratory test site, co-located with Site 1 at White Sands did track asteroids in daytime as proof of concept in the early 1980s.|$|E

40|$|Achieving {{coordinates}} {{of object}} coordinate points with optimum accuracy {{is one of}} the most important issues in close range photogrammetry.

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Of the four {{black and white}} S 190 A <b>camera</b> <b>stations,</b> snowcover is best defined in the two visible spectral bands, {{due in part to}} their better resolution. The overall extent of the snow can be mapped more precisely, and the snow within shadow areas is better defined in the visible bands. Of the two S 190 A color products, the aerial color photography is the better. Because of the contrast in color between snow and snow-free terrain and the better resolution, this product is concluded to be the best overall of the six <b>camera</b> <b>stations</b> for detecting and mapping snow. Overlapping frames permit stereo viewing, which aids in distinguishing clouds from the underlying snow. Because of the greater spatial resolution of the S 190 B earth terrain camera, areal snow extent can be mapped in greater detail than from the S 190 A photographs. The snow line elevation measured from the S 190 A and S 190 B photographs is reasonable compared to the meager ground truth data available...|$|R
40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{study was conducted}} to assess a tree stem reconstruction technique with panoramic images taken with fisheye lenses. The concept is similar to the Structure from Motion (SfM) technique, but the acquisition and data preparation rely on fisheye cameras to generate a vertical image sequence with height variations of the <b>camera</b> <b>station.</b> Each vertical image is rectified to four vertical planes, producing horizontal lateral views. The stems in the lateral view are rectified to the same scale in the image sequence to facilitate image matching. Using bundle adjustment, the stems are reconstructed, enabling later measurement and extraction of several attributes. The 3 D reconstruction was performed with the proposed technique and compared with SfM. The preliminary results showed that the stems were correctly reconstructed by using the lateral virtual images generated from the vertical fisheye images and with the advantage of using fewer images and taken from one single station...|$|E
40|$|Mapping of the Earth {{from space}} {{stations}} can be approached in two areas. One is to collect gravity data for defining topographic datum using Earth's gravity field {{in terms of}} spherical harmonics.

Without ground control points, an integrated camera system can be designed. With ground control points, {{the position of the}} space station (<b>camera</b> <b>station)</b> can be precisely determined at any instant. Therefore, terrestrial topography can be precisely mapped either by conventional photogrammetric methods or by current digital technology of image correlation. For the mapping experiment, it is proposed to establish four ground points either in North America or Africa (including the Sahara desert). If this experiment should be successfully accomplished, it may also be applied to the defense charting systems...|$|E
40|$|Large, {{long-term}} coastal imagery datasets are nowadays {{a low-cost}} {{source of information}} for various coastal research disciplines. However, the applicability of many existing algorithms for coastal image analysis is limited for these large datasets {{due to a lack}} of automation and robustness. Therefore manual quality control and site- and time-dependent calibration are often required. In this paper we present a fully automated algorithm that classifies each pixel in an image given a pre-defined set of classes. The necessary robustness is obtained by distinguishing one class of pixels from another based on more than a thousand pixel features and relations between neighboring pixels rather than a handful of color intensities. Using a manually annotated dataset of 192 coastal images, a SSVM is trained and tested to distinguish between the classes water, sand, vegetation, sky and object. The resulting model correctly classifies 93. 0 % of all pixels in a previously unseen image. Two case studies are used to show how the algorithm extracts beach widths and water lines from a coastal <b>camera</b> <b>station.</b> Both the annotated dataset and the software developed to perform the model training and prediction are provided as free and open-source data sources.

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. A significant and possible major economic {{example of the}} practical value of Skylab photographs was provided by locating on Skylab <b>Camera</b> <b>Station</b> Number 4, frame 010, SL- 2, an area of exposures of limestone rocks which {{were thought to be}} completely covered by volcanic rocks based upon prior mapping. The area is located less than 12 miles north of the Ruth porphyry copper deposit, White Pine County, Nevada. This is a major copper producing open pit mine owned by Kennecott Copper Corporation. Geophysical maps consisting of gravity and aeromagnetic studies have been published indicating three large positive magnetic anomalies located at the Ruth ore deposits, the Ward Mountain, not a mineralized area, and in the area previously thought to be completely covered by post-ore volcanics. Skylab photos indicate, however, that erosion has removed volcanic cover in specific sites sufficient to expose the underlying older rocks suggesting, therefore, that the volcanic rocks may not be the cause of the aeromagnetic anomaly. Field studies have verified the initial interpretations made from the Skylab photos. The potential significance {{of this study is that}} the large positive aeromagnetic anomaly suggests the presence of cooled and solidified magma below the anomalies, in which ore-bearing solutions may have been derived forming possible large ore deposits...|$|E
40|$|Direct Georeferencing {{was shown}} to be an {{important}} alternative to standard indirect image orientation using classical or GPS-supported aerial triangulation. Since direct Georeferencing without ground control relies on an extrapolation process only, particular focus has to be laid on the overall system calibration procedure. The accuracy performance of integrated GPS/inertial systems for direct Georeferencing in airborne photogrammetric environments has been tested extensively in the last years. In this approach, the limiting factor is a correct overall system calibration including the GPS/inertial component as well as the imaging sensor itself. Therefore remaining errors in the system calibration will significantly decrease the quality of object point determination. This research paper presents an error analysis for the airborne direct Georeferencing technique, where integrated GPS/IMU positioning and navigation systems are used, in conjunction with aerial cameras for airborne mapping compared with GPS/INS supported AT through the implementation of certain amount of error on the EOP and Boresight parameters and study the effect of these errors on the final ground coordinates.

The exact location of <b>camera</b> <b>station</b> at time of exposure, exterior orientation parameters, EOP, is known through GPS/INS integration process.

40|$|Since 1995 {{with the}} {{ratification}} {{and enforcement of}} the Non Proliferation Treaty in the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Kazakhstan Atomic Energy Committee (KAEC) {{is responsible for the}} implementation of the State System for Accountancy and Control (SSAC). In the SSAC, data on nuclear material inventories are periodically collected on individual nuclear facilities and stored into the KAEC data base, from which reports are prepared for the IAEA in accordance with the Safeguards Agreement between IAEA and Kazakhstan. Corresponding to the Agreement on Nuclear Safety between Euratom and Kazakhstan a programme on Nuclear Safeguards under TACIS (Technical Assistance for the Commonwealth of Independent States) was launched that should enhance the effectiveness of the present state system. After evaluating the different nuclear facilities in Kazakhstan with KAEC, the following facilities have been identified with a need for enhancing safeguards in methodology and instrumentation: -	the Ulba Fuel Fabrication Plant in Ust-Kamenogorsk -	the research reactors of the Nuclear National Center at the Alatau and Baikal- 1 sites. Mainly, in the first facility, the Ulba plant, a scanning system for accurate, near-real time monitoring of the level and density in multiple tanks have been provided for an enhanced follow-up of the process and in particular the nuclear material flow. The automatic fusion of the data with analysis and interpretation is addressed in a future subsequent project for near real time accountancy at Ulba. Additionally, at the identified facilities a review <b>camera</b> <b>station</b> enhanced the surveillance and complemented the physical protection of the research reactors.
