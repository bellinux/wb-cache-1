50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of the CD-RW technology, a standard for magneto-optical recordable and erasable CDs called CD-MO was introduced in 1990 and set in the Orange Book, part 1, and was basically a CD with a magneto-optical recording layer. The CD-MO standard also allowed for an optional non-erasable zone on the disc, which could be read by normal <b>CD-ROM</b> <b>reader</b> units.|$|E
50|$|Geodat {{was unusual}} in the 1980s in that the {{software}} was often given away free, while data downloads or tapes were charged. Geodat set out a quality management process for digitisation covering acquisition, cataloguing, map stability, transformation algorithms, merging and node coalescing. Geodat also set out a quality standard for comparing digitised maps with source maps, based on using generalisation and interpolation against a maximum orthogonal offset distance. Originally delivered as five large tapes, MundoCart was burned on CD-ROM in 1987. MundoCart {{was one of the}} first CD-ROM applications not brought out by the creators, Philips and Sony. In the early releases of MundoCart, a <b>CD-ROM</b> <b>reader</b> accompanied each purchase.|$|E
50|$|Many people {{compared}} the HiFD to Sony's Betamax videotape format. However, while {{the failure of}} Betamax is often blamed on poor management, it is generally thought that HiFD would ultimately have failed no matter what Sony did - CD-R(W) had a built-in advantage with {{the large number of}} <b>CD-ROM</b> (<b>reader)</b> drives in computers (even taking into account the fact that not all CD drives could read CD-Rs and that most, early on, could not read CD-RWs), and its higher capacity. The fact that ultimately SuperDisk (even as LS-240, which could read and write 240MB and 120MB media, supported 1.44MB HD floppies and could format them up to 30MB) did not survive either is seen as the greatest support for this theory.|$|E

40|$|The CD-Rom format {{has been}} around for some time now with <b>CD-Rom</b> <b>readers</b> a {{standard}} fitting on even the most basic PC. The strength of this technology is that it enables large amounts of data to be stored (650 - 700 MB) on a reliable, portable and economical medium. The character of data stored is virtually only dependant on developments in the hardware and software used to generate and manage datasets, whether numeric arrays, databases, digital imagery or multimedia. These features have made it a popular mode for a diverse range of interactive educational, reference and entertainment software. As a medium that can hold thousand of 'pages' of text, spreadsheets, colour images, animations and digital movies, CD-Rom technology also offers obvious benefits for the delivery of the diversity of data produced by archaeological research. It is surprising then that projects such as the bilingual Cornaline de l'Inde/Carnelian in India are few and far between...|$|R

40|$|The SEAFDEC Aquaculture Department (AQD) is {{mandated}} to develop human resources and to disseminate and exchange information for aquaculture {{development in the}} region. In 1991 - 1994, a total of 294 participants attended 23 sessions of nine training courses. Many others participated in AQD's student practicum, internships, and summer work programs. AQD conducted seminarworkshops on aquaculture development in southeast Asia, fish breeding, feeds and feeding, and training needs. Information materials (newsletters, a monograph, two extension manuals, leaflets, and videos) were produced based on research at AQD. To assist fishfarmers and other sectors of the local aquaculture industry, AQD conducted on-site or outreach seminars, and provided resource persons during fairs and exhibits, seminars, and consultative meetings.

40|$|The European Population since 1945 is the {{companion}} volume to the previously published The European Population 1850 - 1945 : together {{they provide the}} most comprehensive statistical set available on Western European demography. It is a comparative and historical data handbook with accompanying CD-ROM, presenting series data on demographic developments, population and household structures for the countries of Western and Central Europe. All major fields of demographic change are covered: fertility, mortality, marriage and divorce. Population figures are given for each population census by sex, civil status and age. Major demographic developments within the family are described providing a commentary on the main population structures and trends in Europe since 1945 {{to the end of}} the 20 th century. As a supplement to the handbook, a CD-ROM provides data for further analyses of demographic developments, population and household structures in Western and East-Central Europe. The CD-ROM includes not only the printed country tables in computerized form, it also contains additional data tables with basic data on demographic developments that may be used for specific research purposes and statistical analyses. Thus, with the help of the <b>CD-ROM,</b> the <b>reader</b> can study population questions with respect to main trends in demographic developments, the population by size and composition according to region, sex, age and marital status, shifts in the population structure and the composition of households—for individual countries or comparatively...|$|R
40|$|This book is {{an example}} of what may become the norm for history texts-an {{illustrated}} narrative accompanied by a CD-ROM. The text tells the story from the human side. It is based on reflections and quotes from the astronauts, cosmonauts, and team members who participated in the historic partnership. The main chapters give the perspectives of the seven U. S. astronauts living on Mir. The "STS boxes" share the Space Shuttle crews' experiences from the 11 Shuttle-Mir missions. The "Meanwhile on Earth" sections provide details of what was happening on Earth while the attention of the Program focused on the situations in space. The text reflects conventional usage; that is, temperature is given in degrees Fahrenheit, and metrics are used as appropriate. While this publication provides an accurate overview of the Shuttle-Mir Program, the reader is encouraged to explore the companion CD-ROM. It contains a complete, searchable text of the book itself plus source publications, mission data, status reports, drawings and illustrations, videos and hundreds of images, and even a virtual Shuttle-Mir children's book. Of particular interest are the Shuttle-Mir oral history transcripts and the letters written by American astronauts while they were in residence on the Russian space station. Many of the quotes in "Shuttle-Mir: The U. S. and Russia Share History's Highest Stage" came from sources located on the <b>CD-ROM.</b> The <b>reader</b> is invited to explore the Shuttle-Mir story through the words, images, and insights of those who took part in it...|$|R

5000|$|Moulthrop began {{experimenting with}} {{hypertext}} {{theory in the}} 1980s, and has since authored several articles as well as written many hypertext fiction works. He has had {{an article published in}} Wired magazine His hypertext Victory Garden was featured {{on the front page of}} the New York Times Book Review from a review by Robert Coover, and Hegirascope won the Eastgate Systems HYSTRUCT Award. He served as co-editor for Postmodern Culture and is currently listed as part of their editorial collective. He is partnered with Nancy Kaplan, Michael Joyce, and John McDaid in TINAC (Textuality, Intertextuality, Narrative, and Conscioussness). In 1987, Moulthrop created forking paths for an undergraduate writing class as a demonstration of hypertext, appropriating Borges' [...] "Garden of Forking Paths". This article acknowledges the possibility of having one source of data link to a group of data, which links to other group of data, and so forth until the viewer decides to exit the pool of information. The work is now available through The New Media <b>Reader</b> <b>cd-rom.</b> Currently, Moulthrop is working on Creatures and Creators, a hypermedia cross-edition of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and James Whale's 1931 film of the same title, and Chaos, a hypermedia fiction.|$|R
