5|$|Cavallo began {{a second}} wave of privatizations with the <b>Correo</b> Argentino and the nuclear power plants. He also limited {{the amount of money}} {{released}} to the provinces. He still had the full support of Menem, despite growing opposition within the PJ. The Mexican Tequila Crisis impacted the national economy, causing a deficit, recession, and a growth in unemployment. The government further reduced public expenditures, the wages of state workers, and raised taxes. The deficit and recession were reduced, but unemployment stayed high. External debt increased. The crisis also proved that the economic system was vulnerable to capital flight. The growing discontent over unemployment and the scandals caused by the privatization of the <b>Correo</b> led to Cavallo's removal as minister, and his replacement by Roque Fernández. Fernández maintained Cavallo's fiscal austerity. He increased the price of fuels, sold the state shares of YPF to Repsol, fired state employees, and increased the value-added tax to 21%. He also undertook more privatization. A new labor law was met with resistance, both by Peronists, opposition parties, and unions, and could not be approved by Congress. The 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 1998 Russian financial crisis also affected the country with consequences that lasted longer than the Tequilla Crisis and started a depression.|$|E
25|$|In 1514, Don Lorenzo Galindez de Carvajal by a royal warrant was {{appointed}} the hereditary title and duties of <b>Correo</b> Mayor of the Indias and lands to be discovered. The <b>Correo</b> Mayor represented {{the office of}} Postmaster General. Many years passed before a descendant of Don Carvajal arrived in Lima (Peru) to take office. They established a postal service in Peru and {{part of what is}} today Ecuador, using the old Inca mail runners, the Chasquis, as well as the existing routes. References show that the <b>Correo</b> Mayor officials didn’t start operating in Colombian territory until about 1717. The <b>Correo</b> Mayor period ended in 1768, when the Spanish Crown took back the postal services monopoly and named José Antonio de Pando Postmaster General of the Viceroyalties of Peru and New Granada. He travelled throughout the countries and established new postal routes, appointed administrators and set tariffs.|$|E

Others focused on Chucho’s morality, especially the nonviolent nature of his crimes.|$|E

25|$|In 1944, groups {{supporting}} women's suffrage, {{the most}} important being Feminine Action, organized around the country. During 1945, women attained {{the right to vote}} at a municipal level. This was followed by a stronger call of action. Feminine Action began editing a newspaper called the <b>Correo</b> Cívico Femenino, to connect, inform and orientate Venezuelan women in their struggle. Finally, after the 1945 Venezuelan Coup d'État and the call for a new Constitution, to which women were elected, women's suffrage became a constitutional right in the country.|$|E
25|$|The fight {{from within}} against the Inquisition {{was almost always}} clandestine. The first texts that {{questioned}} the Inquisition and praised the ideas of Voltaire or Montesquieu appeared in 1759. After the suspension of pre-publication censorship {{on the part of}} the Council of Castile in 1785, the newspaper El Censor began the publication of protests against the activities of the Holy Office by means of a rationalist critique. Valentin de Foronda published Espíritu de los Mejores Diarios, a plea in favour of freedom of expression that was avidly read in the salons. Also, in the same vein, Manuel de Aguirre wrote On Toleration in El Censor, El <b>Correo</b> de los Ciegos and El Diario de Madrid.|$|E
25|$|Comín {{appreciated}} Larramendi following {{works of}} the Zaragoza group; he suggested that the Madrid lawyer becomes his replacement. Don Jaime acknowledged Larramendi’s loyalty during the strife for control of El <b>Correo.</b> Moreover, as a young militant deprived of own political basis {{he seemed to have}} posed no threat to royal leadership; his location in Madrid and profession of a lawyer offered additional advantages. Lack of experience was a disadvantage; Melgar dissuaded the choice also due to pro-German Larramendi’s leaning during the war. Don Jaime’s special envoy to Madrid returned with good news and in August 1919 the claimant appointed Larramendi his key representative in Spain and effectively the party leader, though not with the title of Jefe Delegado, but as a Secretario General.|$|E

25|$|The {{most famous}} of the early designs is that named after the {{architect}} who designed it, John Penfold. Penfold boxes come in three sizes and altogether there are nine different types. They are very widespread, with the biggest accumulations in London and Cheltenham. Others are spread across England, Ireland, India (including locally made copies), British Guyana, Australia and New Zealand. An export order from the postal service of the Republic of Uruguay resulted in nine boxes of the Penfold design being exported there in 1879, of which six are believed extant, including one in the philatelic department of the central Post Office in Montevideo. In 1993 the <b>Correo</b> Uruguayo commemorated Penfold post boxes {{with a set of}} stamps of various denominations.|$|E
25|$|Next to the {{national}} and postal institutions of the states, private delivery services existed of which some used its own adhesives. The legal basis for this was laid on 27 April 1859, when the Colombian Parliament of the Confederation stated by law that the Postal Service {{should not be the}} monopoly of the central government, but that the Colombian governments, businesses and even individuals should be part of it, even in the same postal routes established by the Central Government. A total of 14 entities issued stamps for their private mail service, most of them in the 1920s and 1930s. In the nineteenth century there existed two private services, the 1870 <b>Correo</b> Semanal Del Dorado in the Guasca District and the 1882 Barranquilla OASM delivery service.|$|E
25|$|Larramendi {{faced an}} {{extremely}} {{difficult task of}} re-building command structures. He threw himself {{into a series of}} hectic meetings with provincial and regional leaders, incessantly touring the country; in some cases, like Catalonia or Valencia, he faced also bitter personal conflicts. Apart from that, as a lawyer he successfully kept fighting off the Mellistas when struggling for El <b>Correo.</b> His first major initiative was launching the project of a grand Carlist assembly; it materialized in November 1919 as Magna Junta de Biarritz. The event was a success as it consolidated the party and helped it to re-gain momentum, even though in none of 3 major issued debated - re-organization, financial problems and marriage of Don Jaime - any key decision was adopted.|$|E

25|$|The Cúcuta Chamber of Commerce {{was founded}} {{around the year}} 1890 as a {{non-profit}} entity {{of the government of}} Colombia, attached to the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism. The Chamber organized a mail service named <b>Correo</b> del Comercio (Business mail), a service which operated between 1890 and 1915. The mail service was intended to improve the communication between the Santander Provinces and Venezuela and to create faster access to the coast of Maracaibo. Mail was handled between Cúcuta and the golf of Maracaibo in Venezuela, which at the time had a permanent marine communication with Europe and North America. The chamber never issued stamps for this service, only a few registration labels. Stamps of the national postal system were used at the official postage rates cancelled by various types of ”CORREO DEL COMERCIO” handstamps.|$|E
25|$|Mariano Hernando {{was not a}} Carlist; it was {{thanks to}} the {{influence}} of his paternal grandfather that during his childhood and youth Luis embraced Carlism. When at the University he befriended a number of Traditionalist-minded students like conde Rodezno, conde de Doña Marina and Rafael Díaz Aguado Salaberry; together with them {{in the first decade of}} the 20th century he was active in Juventud Carlista and Congregación de los Luises, a Jesuit youth organization. In 1904 he was briefly editor-in-chief of an ephemeral Carlist daily El <b>Correo</b> de Guipúzcoa, though it is not clear whether he lived in San Sebastián at that time. In Madrid he gained recognition in 1905 becoming secretary of Sección de Ciencias Historicas of Ateneo de Madrid, though principally as a young and successful lawyer, involved in cases gaining wider publicity.|$|E
25|$|Cavallo accused {{businessman}} Alfredo Yabrán in 1995 {{of being}} a sort of mafia boss who enjoyed political and judicial protection, who covertly ran several major transport and security companies including <b>Correo</b> OCA (which handled 30% of the Argentine postal market), and whose firms were involved in drugs and weapons trafficking and money laundering. After José Luis Cabezas, a photojournalist who was investigating Yabrán, was murdered in 1997, it was shown that Yabrán had connections {{at the highest levels}} of government and had bought Menem a mansion. Yabrán was found dead in 1998, a supposed suicide – although some observers questioned whether he had in fact killed himself, and some raised doubts as to whether the body was even his. However, there have been no sighting reports, and the DNA testings on the corpse confirmed that it was Yabrán.|$|E

25|$|As {{the crisis}} in Cuba mounted, the liberal press was {{repeatedly}} warning against a new Carlist insurgency, allegations usually refuted by <b>Correo</b> Español. Small Carlist groups indeed resolved to violence and de Cerralbo tried to prevent the phenomenon. The pretender seemed decided not to weaken the country while {{at war with the}} United States, but the situation changed following the disastrous peace of 1898, as Carlos VII made some moves interpreted as preparation to another Carlist war. Cerralbo, widely considered the leader of the pigeons and confronted by the hawks like Llorens, was rumored to be dismissed soon. Quoting health reasons he left Spain and distanced himself from the conflict, finally handing his resignation as Jefe Delegado in late 1899. The notice was accepted by Carlos VII, who nominated Matías Barrio y Mier as the new political leader.|$|E
25|$|A {{section of}} this housing, on Santa Isabel Alley, was torn down and {{replaced}} by the National Theater in the latter 19th century. During the late 19th century and very early 20th, this theatre {{was the site of}} most of Mexico City's high culture, presenting events such as theatre, operettas, Viennese dance and more. It was then decided to replace this building with a more opulent one for the upcoming Centennial of Mexican Independence celebrations in 1910. The old theatre was demolished in 1901, and the new theatre would be called the Gran Teatro de Ópera. The work was awarded to Italian architect Adamo Boari, who favored neoclassical and art nouveau styles and who is responsible for the Palacio del <b>Correo</b> which is across the street. Adamo Boari promised in October 1904 to build a grand metallic structure, which at that time only existed in the United States, but not to this size. The first stone of the building was placed by Porfirio Díaz in 1904. Despite the 1910 deadline, by 1913, the building was hardly begun with only a basic shell. One {{reason for this is that}} the project became more complicated than anticipated as the heavy building sank into the soft spongy subsoil. The other reason was the political and economic instability that would lead to the Mexican Revolution. Full hostilities suspended construction of the palace completely and Adamo Boari returned to Italy.|$|E
