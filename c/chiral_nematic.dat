5|$|Blue phases are {{liquid crystal}} phases {{that appear in}} the {{temperature}} range between a <b>chiral</b> <b>nematic</b> phase and an isotropic liquid phase. Blue phases have a regular three-dimensional cubic structure of defects with lattice periods of several hundred nanometers, and thus they exhibit selective Bragg reflections in the wavelength range of visible light corresponding to the cubic lattice. It was theoretically predicted in 1981 that these phases can possess icosahedral symmetry similar to quasicrystals.|$|E
5|$|The <b>chiral</b> <b>nematic</b> phase {{exhibits}} chirality (handedness). This {{phase is}} often called the cholesteric phase because it was first observed for cholesterol derivatives. Only chiral molecules (i.e., those that have no internal planes of symmetry) can give rise to such a phase. This phase exhibits a twisting of the molecules perpendicular to the director, with the molecular axis parallel to the director. The finite twist angle between adjacent molecules is due to their asymmetric packing, which results in longer-range chiral order. In the smectic C* phase (an asterisk denotes a chiral phase), the molecules have positional ordering in a layered structure (as in the other smectic phases), with the molecules tilted by a finite angle {{with respect to the}} layer normal. The chirality induces a finite azimuthal twist from one layer to the next, producing a spiral twisting of the molecular axis along the layer normal.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} variant of the antiferromagnetic XY model on the {{triangular}} lattice to study the interplay between the <b>chiral</b> and <b>nematic</b> orders in addition to the magnetic order. The model has a significant bi-quadratic interaction of the planar spins. When the bi-quadratic exchange energy dominates, a large temperature window is shown to exist over which the <b>nematic</b> and the <b>chiral</b> orders co-exist without the magnetic order, thus defining a chiral-nematic state.

5|$|The chiral pitch, p, {{refers to}} the {{distance}} over which the LC molecules undergo a full 360° twist (but note that {{the structure of the}} <b>chiral</b> <b>nematic</b> phase repeats itself every half-pitch, since in this phase directors at 0° and ±180° are equivalent). The pitch, p, typically changes when the temperature is altered or when other molecules are added to the LC host (an achiral LC host material will form a chiral phase if doped with a chiral material), allowing the pitch of a given material to be tuned accordingly. In some liquid crystal systems, the pitch is of the same order as the wavelength of visible light. This causes these systems to exhibit unique optical properties, such as Bragg reflection and low-threshold laser emission, and these properties are exploited in a number of optical applications. For the case of Bragg reflection only the lowest-order reflection is allowed if the light is incident along the helical axis, whereas for oblique incidence higher-order reflections become permitted. Cholesteric liquid crystals also exhibit the unique property that they reflect circularly polarized light when it is incident along the helical axis and elliptically polarized if it comes in obliquely.|$|E

Only the nematic mesophase has thermochromic properties; this restricts the effective temperature range of the material.|$|R

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{properties}} of biaxial particles interacting via an anisotropic pair potential, involving second rank quadrupolar and third rank octupolar coupling terms, using Monte Carlo simulation. The particles occupy the sites of a 2 D square lattice and the interactions are restricted to nearest neighbours.

40|$|Order {{parameters}} and phenomenological theory for both high- and low-symmetry biaxial nematic phases are presented {{and it is}} predicted that the chiral low-symmetry biaxial phase must be ferroelectric. This conclusion is based on general symmetry arguments and {{on the results of}} the Landau-de Gennes theory. The microscopic mechanism of the ferroelectric ordering in this chiral biaxial phase is illustrated using a simple molecular model based on dispersion interactions between biaxial molecules of low symmetry. Similar to the chiral smectic C* phase, the ferroelectricity in the <b>chiral</b> biaxial <b>nematic</b> phase is improper, i. e., polarization is not a primary order parameter and is not determined by dipolar interactions. Ferroelectric ordering in biaxial nematics may be found, in principle, in materials composed of chiral analogues of the tetrapod molecules which are known to exhibit biaxial phases...|$|R

50|$|Chirality is {{important}} in context of ordered phases as well, for example {{the addition of a}} small amount of an optically active molecule to a nematic phase (a phase that has long range orientational order of molecules) transforms that phase to a <b>chiral</b> <b>nematic</b> phase (or cholesteric phase).

40|$|We {{show that}} the flexoelectric model of chiral and achiral {{modulated}} nematics predicts the compression modulus that is by orders of magnitude lower than the measured values. The discrepancy is much larger in the <b>chiral</b> modulated <b>nematic</b> phase, in which the measured value of the compression modulus is of the same order of magnitude as in achiral modulated nematics, even though the heliconical pitch is by {{an order of magnitude}} larger. The relaxation of a one-constant approximation in the biaxial elastic model used for chiral modulated nematics does not solve the problem. Therefore, we propose a structural model of the modulated nematic phase, which is consistent with the current experimental evidence and can also explain large compression modulus: the structure consists of short-range smectic clusters with a fourfold symmetry and periodicity of two molecular distances. In chiral systems, chiral interactions lead to a helicoidal structure of such clusters...|$|R

Isobaric Monte Carlo numerical simulations are used to trace the phase diagram; on going from the low- density isotropic to the high-density compact phases a rich polymorphism is observed, exhibiting a special <b>chiral</b> screw-like <b>nematic</b> phase and a number of chiral and/or polar smectic phases. We present full characterization of the latter, showing that they have unconventional features, ascribable to the helical shape of the constituent particles. Equal area construction is used to locate the isotropic-to- nematic phase transition, and the results are compared with those stemming from an Onsager-like theory. Density functional theory is also used to study the nematic-to-screw-nematic phase transition; within the simplifying assumption of perfectly parallel helices, we compare different levels of approximation, that is second- and third-virial expansions and a Parsons–Lee correctio...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Induced cholesteric mesophases are {{generated}} {{by the addition of}} small quantities of <b>chiral</b> compounds to <b>nematic</b> liquid crystals.

All these applications are based on the determination of the pitch and handedness of the induced cholesteric helix. This determination is not as straightforward {{as in the case of}} ordinary cholesterics, since induced cholesterics usually show selective reflection bands in the IR rather than in the vis- ible region [5].

Our colloidal suspensions consist of highly monodisperse, semi-flexible filamentous viruses which have been coated with neutral hydrophilic polymers by irreversibly binding poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) {{to the surface of}} the virus particles. Depending on the size of the grafted polymer, up to three different phase transitions are observed (isotropic-to-chiral <b>nematic,</b> <b>chiral</b> nematic-to-smectic, and smectic-to-columnar). Each phase transition is shown to be independent of ionic strength, confirming the steric stabilization of the viral colloids. A direct, i. e. without any free parameters, comparison with theory and computer simulations of the volume fraction associated with the phase transition can be performed, showing a quantitative agreement with hard rod behavior at a low polymer chain size, and some deviation stemming from soft repulsion by increasing the polymer thickness coating of the rod.
