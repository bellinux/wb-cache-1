5|$|Dentition is the {{key feature}} by which fossil rodents are {{recognized}} and the earliest record of such mammals comes from the Paleocene, shortly after the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs some 66 million years ago. These fossils are found in Laurasia, the supercontinent composed of modern-day North America, Europe, and Asia. The divergence of Glires, a clade consisting of rodents and lagomorphs (rabbits, hares and pikas), from other placental mammals occurred within a few million years after the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary; rodents and lagomorphs then radiated during the Cenozoic. Some molecular <b>clock</b> <b>data</b> suggest modern rodents (members of the order Rodentia) had appeared by the late Cretaceous, although other molecular divergence estimations are {{in agreement with the}} fossil record.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between adapiform and lemuriform primates {{has not been}} clearly demonstrated, so the position of adapiforms as a paraphyletic stem group is questionable. Both molecular <b>clock</b> <b>data</b> and new fossil finds suggest that the lemuriform divergence from the other primates and the subsequent lemur-lorisoid split both predate the appearance of adapiforms in the early Eocene. New calibration methods may reconcile the discrepancies between the molecular clock and the fossil record, favoring more recent divergence dates. The fossil record suggests that the strepsirrhine adapiforms and the haplorhine omomyiforms had been evolving independently before the early Eocene, although their most basal members share enough dental similarities {{to suggest that they}} diverged during the Paleocene (66–55mya).|$|E
25|$|The GPS {{receiver}} can immediately {{apply the}} fast type of correction data, {{which includes the}} corrected satellite position and <b>clock</b> <b>data,</b> and determines its current location using normal GPS calculations. Once an approximate position fix is obtained the receiver begins to use the slow corrections to improve its accuracy. Among the slow correction data is the ionospheric delay. As the GPS signal travels from the satellite to the receiver, it passes through the ionosphere. The receiver calculates the location where the signal pierced the ionosphere and, if it has received an ionospheric delay value for that location, corrects for the error the ionosphere created.|$|E
5000|$|A source-synchronous clock {{topology}} eliminates two {{of these}} factors, [...] and [...] The former is eliminated since both <b>clock</b> and <b>data</b> signals are driven by identical flip-flops on the same silicon at the same temperature and voltage, thereby equalizing the [...] seen by both <b>clock</b> and <b>data.</b> The latter is eliminated {{for the same reason}} - since the <b>clock</b> and <b>data</b> are driven by identical devices and (ideally) connected with wires of equal length, the skew between <b>clock</b> and <b>data</b> is greatly reduced. For this reason, [...] can be reduced significantly. Since frequency is inversely proportional to clock period, the clock frequency increases as a result.|$|R
50|$|There are {{additional}} benefits from FPD-Link II. For example, the car makers appreciate the increased cable length even with reduced cable cost. This {{is because of}} the embedded clock feature that eliminates the timing skew between <b>clock</b> and <b>data</b> signals. This was the limiting factor to cables with separate <b>clock</b> and <b>data</b> pairs because all pairs had to be manufactured at precisely equal length to control the timing skew between the <b>clock</b> and <b>data</b> pairs. This length matching added to the cable cost.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>CLOCK</b> and <b>DATA</b> {{signals are}} {{transmitted}} according to RS-422 standards. RS-422, {{also known as}} ANSI/TIA/EIA-422-B, is a technical standard that specifies the electrical characteristics of the balanced voltage digital interface circuit. Data is transmitted using balanced or differential signalling i.e. the <b>CLOCK</b> and <b>DATA</b> lines are basically twisted pair cables.|$|R
25|$|Molecular <b>clock</b> <b>data</b> suggest {{echidnas}} {{split from}} platypuses between 19 and 48 million years ago, and that platypus-like fossils {{dating back to}} over 112.5 million years ago therefore represent basal forms, rather than close relatives of the modern platypus. This would imply that echidnas evolved from water-foraging ancestors that returned to living completely on the land, even though this put them in competition with marsupials. Further evidence of possible water-foraging ancestors {{can be found in}} some of the echidna's phenotypic traits as well. Traits such as: as hydrodynamic streamlining, dorsally projecting hind limbs acting as rudders, and locomotion founded on hypertrophied humeral long-axis rotation, which provides a very efficient swimming stroke. Consequently, oviparous reproduction in monotremes may have given them an advantage over marsupials, a view consistent with present ecological partitioning between the two groups. This advantage could as well be in part responsible for the observed associated adaptive radiation of echidnas and expansion of the niche space, which together contradict the fairly common assumption of halted morphological and molecular evolution that continues to be associated with monotremes. Furthermore, studies of mitochondrial DNA in platypuses have also found that monotremes and marsupials are most likely sister taxa. It also implies that any shared derived morphological traits between marsupials and placental mammals either occurred independently from one another or were lost in the lineage to monotremes.|$|E
