The aqueous solutions of sulphamic acid do not emit <b>corrosive</b> <b>fumes</b> but solubilize scales with its –NH 2 and –OH functional groups thereby forming soluble compounds with most industrial deposits [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Addition of a corrosion inhibitor to sulphamic acid solution is very important to keep the surface of metal intact and reduce the damage due to corrosion during the cleaning and pickling process. However, most of the synthetic corrosion inhibitors are harmful to the environment, which has directed the attention of scientists on the development of non-toxic green corrosion inhibitors [9, 10].|$|R
50|$|Piranha {{solution}} {{should always}} be prepared by adding hydrogen peroxide to sulfuric acid slowly, never in reverse. Mixing the solution is extremely exothermic.

Solutions made using hydrogen peroxide at concentrations greater than 50% may cause an explosion. Once the mixture has stabilized, it can be further heated to sustain its reactivity. The hot (often bubbling) solution cleans organic compounds off substrates and oxidizes or hydroxylates most metal surfaces. Cleaning usually requires about 10 to 40 minutes, after which the substrates can be removed from the solution.|$|R

40|$|Certain {{components}} of motors degrade {{with time and}} operating stress. Electrical insulation weakens over time with exposure to voltage unbalance, over and undervoltage, voltage disturbances, and temperature. Contact between moving surfaces causes wear. Wear is affected by dirt, moisture, and <b>corrosive</b> <b>fumes</b> and is greatly accelerated when lubricant is misapplied, becomes overheated or contaminated, or is not replaced at regular intervals. When any components are degraded beyond the point of economical repair or replacement, the motor’s economic life ends. For the smallest and least expensive standard efficiency motors, the motor should be put out of service and replaced when a key component, such as a bearing, fails. Depending on type and replacement cost, larger standard motors—up to 20 or 50 horsepower (hp) —may be refurbished and get new bearings but are often scrapped after a winding failure. Still larger and more expensive motors may be refurbished and rewound to extend life indefinitely.

50|$|There {{are five}} {{varieties}} of human worlds: Agri-worlds are highly rich in fertile land with farming and animal husbandry being the main ways of life. These worlds are usually pre-industrial {{in nature and}} are havens of idyllic lifestyles for retiring members of the military; they supply food and basic fabrics to whole sectors. Death worlds feature wild, often extremely hazardous, landscapes with numerous dangerous flora and fauna species. The few human inhabitants of these worlds are usually rugged survivalists with unflinching natures, ideal recruitment centers for the military. Shrine worlds are the final resting places of extensively decorated or martyred holy individuals, also serving as vast memorial sites and grand monuments for epic events in the imperial history. Though the local populations are minimal, millions of people engage in pilgrimages to shrine worlds {{from every corner of}} the Imperium each year. Hive worlds, also known as Imperial Worlds, are extensively developed planets with towering city structures that stretch for many hundreds of kilometers in every direction; tens of billions of citizens live in basic hab-blocks with often substandard living conditions while the local aristocracy and ranking officials wallow in extreme luxury and decadence. These worlds form the fortified capital planets of the Imperium where millions of citizens are recruited as hard laborers or soldiers in the Imperial Guard and other military organizations.

This study represents the first attempt to investigate CO 2 capture using NOHMs. In this dissertation, NOHMs were designed, synthesized and evaluated for CO 2 capture properties. Characterization of NOHMs was conducted by employing various spectroscopic tools, such as ATR FT-IR, Raman and NMR, to confirm successful synthesis of NOHMs. Thermal stability and nanoscale configuration of NOHMs were measured using TGA and TEM, respectively. NOHMs with various chemical and structural parameters, including bonding types, functional groups, chain lengths, core sizes, and core fractions, were prepared. The effects of these parameters on CO 2 capture relevant properties such as thermal stability, thermally-induced swelling, CO 2 -induced swelling, CO 2 packing behavior and CO 2 capture capacity were explored in detail. In comparison to the unbound polymers, NOHMs exhibited enhanced thermal stability. Such an enhancement allows NOHMs to be used in a wide-range of operational temperatures. While an unbound polymer degraded 80 wt% after a 100 -cycle temperature swing, there was no significant loss in its corresponding NOHMs. Elevated temperatures also caused NOHMs to swell but the degree of thermally-induced swelling of NOHMs was less than that of the unbound polymers due to restriction on movement of the tethered polymer chains. CO 2 capture capacity studies revealed that NOHMs can capture 0. 1 - 0. 4 mmol/g-solvent depending on partial pressure of CO 2 and temperatures. The CO 2 capture mechanism was also revealed as a Lewis acid-base interaction between CO 2 and ether groups which were the most common functional groups of the polymers selected for the NOHMs synthesis (e. g. NOHM-I-HPE, NOHM-I-tPE and NOHM-I-PEG). The effect of functional groups on CO 2 capture was far more significant. When amines were incorporated in NOHMs (e. g. 2. 2 mmol/g-solvent in NOHM-I-PEI), as expected, the presence of amines enhanced CO 2 capture capacity. While the enthalpic effect was pronounced, the entropic effect from NOHMs' unique structural nature would allow CO 2 to be captured more effectively. In order to explore the entropic effect, NOHMs were synthesized to minimize the enthalpic effect for the most of structural studies, such as studies of CO 2 -induced swelling and interaction of CO 2 with the canopy. For the CO 2 -induced swelling behavior, NOHMs exhibited notably less swelling than the unbound polymers at a given CO 2 capture capacity. NOHMs comprised of shorter polymer chains exhibited even less swelling than NOHMs having longer polymer chains at a given CO 2 capture capacity. This may be due to conformational differences between NOHMs and the unbound polymers which allow more CO 2 molecules to pack within polymer chains. Such conformational differences were further pronounced by lowering the grafting densities in NOHMs. These differences were attributed to specific structural configuration of a NOHMs' canopy in which polymer chains were tethered onto inorganic nanoparticle cores causing more "rigid" arrangements than in a bulk polymer. In order to facilitate the implementation of NOHMs for CO 2 capture, several aspects were also investigated, including impact of SO 2, viscosity of NOHMs and CO 2 diffusivity in NOHMs. It was found that no significant amount of SO 2 was captured in NOHMs at low concentration (200 ppm of SO 2 in N 2), while a considerable amount of SO 2 was captured by NOHMs at 3010 ppm of SO 2 in N 2. As N 2 is almost insoluble in NOHMs, NOHMs showed a high selectivity toward SO 2 capture over N 2 capture. This behavior enables NOHMs to be a potential candidate for SO 2 removal. About 10 - 30 % of CO 2 capture capacity was reduced after NOHMs exposed to SO 2 due to unavailability of some capture sites in NOHMs, which were occupied by SO 2. The result of the simultaneous removal of CO 2 and SO 2 showed that at low SO 2 concentration, NOHMs did not exhibit a noticeable selectivity toward SO 2 over CO 2. CO 2 capture capacity and CO 2 -induced swelling were also measured with a mixture of CO 2 /SO 2 to explore the effect of SO 2 on CO 2 -induced swelling and packing behaviors of NOHMs. Similar swelling behaviors were observed under pressurization with CO 2 /SO 2 and pure CO 2 at low pressures. However, swelling behaviors of two cases deviated at higher pressures. This may be attributed to the distinct packing patterns in NOHMs under the pressurization with CO 2 /SO 2 compared to the pressurization with pure CO 2. The viscosity and CO 2 diffusivity in NOHMs with various structural parameters were also measured. The effect of core size was not pronounced on viscosity and CO 2 diffusivity as the core fraction was fixed. In contrast, a higher core fraction in NOHMs resulted in a significantly higher viscosity and a lower CO 2 diffusivity. The effect of temperature was also notable on CO 2 diffusion in NOHMs. However, a higher temperature can {{have a negative impact on}} the CO 2 capture capacity of NOHMs. To obtain an improved CO 2 diffusivity for CO 2 capture, the optimal operation temperature ranging from 40 to 70 ºC was determined. Finally, if the viscosity of NOHMs could be appropriately lowered by manipulating core sizes and core fractions at an optimal operation temperature, fluid NOHMs could be used in a spraying tower to capture CO 2. For relatively viscous NOHMs, such as amine functionalized NOHMs, a supported liquid membrane system could be used by coating or filling NOHMs inside the membrane to increase contact area for CO 2 capture. NOHMs could also be even functionalized to serve as dual-purpose smart materials for CO 2 capture and photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 to alcohols. A significantly amount of energy could be saved from solvent regeneration and the product would improve the process economics. In summary, NOHMs were designed and synthesized to investigate the effects of chemical and structural parameters on key factors affecting CO 2 capture, including thermal stability, thermally-induced swelling, CO 2 -induced swelling, CO 2 packing behavior, selectivity, viscosity and CO 2 diffusivity. The fundamental knowledge gained in this study not only became a basis for the optimal design of NOHMs for CO 2 capture but also provided important information on how to design nanoscale hybrid materials for other advanced environmental and energy technologies...|$|R
