40|$|The {{confluence}} of the institutionalization of the equity market and {{of the development of}} computer technology is having a drastic organizational impact on the American stock market. The Institutional Investor Study called for a competitive <b>central</b> <b>market</b> <b>system.</b> The Martin Report accelerated the development of such a system, but {{it is unlikely that the}} system that will evolve will bear much resemblance to the one recommended in that Report. The first commission rate system seems to have little chance of surviving. Full-fledged institutional membership is almost inevitable. The <b>central</b> <b>market</b> <b>system</b> is on the horizon. That might not have been true if the Martin Report had not been written [...] The Report was to be the solution to the market's ills. Unfortunately, the Report diagnosed healthy competition as a cancerous growth.

They {{can be seen as}} peers. Electronic trading venues in the United States are linked together through the <b>central</b> National <b>Market</b> <b>System</b> (NMS) and a set of rules enabling communication on this network, the Regulation NMS. Although in Europe regulation is not forcing the linkage of venues, regulatory actions encourage the development towards a single European capital market. One already established mechanism among European trading venues is the reference price principle. In this conceptual work, a peer-to-peer network of trading venues is presented together with economic algorithms enabling communication among peers as a decentralized alternative to a <b>central</b> <b>market</b> <b>system</b> aiming at integration of venues...|$|R

40|$|Part 2 : Design, Manufacturing and Production ManagementInternational audienceSelf-adjustable {{interval}} prediction securities (SIPS) are newly proposed prediction securities {{that are}} suitable for market-based demand forecasting. The whole feasible region of the demand quantity to be estimated is divided into a fixed number of mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive prediction intervals. Subsequently, a set of winner-take-all-type securities are issued that correspond to these intervals. Each portion of the securities wins a unitary payoff only if the actual sales volume falls in the corresponding interval. The contracts are called SIPS because the borders between the intervals are dynamically and adaptively self-adjusted to maintain the informativeness of the output forecast distribution. This paper first designs a prediction <b>market</b> <b>system</b> using SIPS equipped with a <b>central</b> <b>market</b> maker and then confirms how the system operates through agent-based simulation...|$|R
