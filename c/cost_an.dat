5|$|Lynemouth's future came further {{under threat}} in March 2011, {{following}} carbon cutting measures {{announced in the}} 2011 United Kingdom budget. The government's plans meant that the station would <b>cost</b> <b>an</b> extra £40million a year, erasing Rio Tinto Alcan's profits on the station. This has made the station's operators consider the option of converting the power station to operate on biomass only to avoid the penalties. However, this conversion itself would cost 400 million euros million and then using biomass instead of coal would <b>cost</b> <b>an</b> additional £170million a year.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{construction}} {{began on}} the third phase of the bypass, connecting the southern segment at Highway7 with the northern segment north of 16th Avenue. This four lane section opened on October24, 2006. The two lane road between this new section and 16th Avenue was subsequently closed and removed. Phase1 <b>cost</b> <b>an</b> estimated $19.3 million; phase2 an estimated $5.5 million; phase3 an estimated $10.8 million.|$|E

It was shot with 35 mm cameras brought from São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, and filming took place in five weeks between September and October 2001.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cost</b> is <b>an</b> {{important}} factor in game play and {{can be summed up}} as the weight of the player's action. With some exceptions, all cards have <b>a</b> <b>cost</b> attached to them and when used this cost transfers to the player. Cost varies radically from card to card. The higher the <b>cost</b> <b>a</b> character has, the longer that character must wait until their next turn. The lower the <b>cost</b> <b>a</b> character has, the shorter that character must wait until their next turn. For example: if a player character has <b>a</b> <b>cost</b> of 10 and a guard has <b>a</b> <b>cost</b> of 15, then the character's turn would occur before the guard's.|$|R
5|$|Changing clocks and DST rules has {{a direct}} {{economic}} cost, entailing extra work to support remote meetings, computer applications and the like. For example, a 2007 North American rule change <b>cost</b> <b>an</b> estimated $500million to $1billion, and Utah State University economist William F. Shughart II has estimated the lost opportunity cost at around $1.7 billion USD. Although {{it has been argued}} that clock shifts correlate with decreased economic efficiency, and that in 2000 the daylight-saving effect implied an estimated one-day loss of $31billion on U.S. stock exchanges, the estimated numbers depend on the methodology. The results have been disputed, and the original authors have refuted the points raised by disputers.|$|E
5|$|Community Transit's Strategic Planning Group {{published}} a recommendation in 2004, calling for {{bus rapid transit}} service on the State Route 99 corridor between Everett Station and Aurora Village Transit Center, featuring off-board fare collection, limited stops, and transit signal priority. The route alternatives proposed included express service from Aurora Village to Downtown Seattle via Aurora Avenue North or Interstate 5, as well as express service on Interstate 5 in Everett, if a partnership to share costs with Everett Transit for the Evergreen Way segment was not viable. In December 2005, the CT Board of Directors approved an accelerated planning schedule for a bus rapid transit project, to <b>cost</b> <b>an</b> estimated $15–20 million, and to begin service as the first such system in the Puget Sound region in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{continued}} {{under the}} overall direction of James of Saint George, a Savoy architect and military engineer. In 1286, {{at the height}} of the construction, the workforce comprised 546 general labourers, 115 quarriers, 30 blacksmiths, 22 carpenters and 227 stonemasons, and the project was costing nearly £240 a month. The castle was essentially complete by the end of 1289, having <b>cost</b> <b>an</b> estimated £8,190, around 10 percent of the £80,000 that Edward spent on castle-building in Wales between 1277 and 1304.|$|E

5|$|During 1939 and 1940, {{a fourth}} batch of ten {{locomotives}} (Nos. 6235–6244) {{was built in}} streamlined form commencing with No. 6235 City of Birmingham. The names of cities for the locomotives {{would seem to have}} been adopted because the LMS was fast running out of names of Duchesses. These locomotives <b>cost</b> <b>an</b> average of £10,659 for the first five and £10,838 each for the second five. The names of the cities in this batch were in strict alphabetical order.

Divers from the Smithsonian Institution recovered an anchor, dishes from the ship's dining hall {{and a variety of}} other artifacts during their 1967 expedition. Tecumseh′s engine room gong was also removed and is currently on display at the Hampton Roads Naval Museum. The wreck site is marked and under United States Coast Guard surveillance pending continued preservation efforts.

However, traditional Cameroonian chieftaincies were re-established on 11 July 1977 by Decree #77/609, and by the 1990s, Cameroonian ethnic groups had rejuvenated these dormant traditions. Atangana's daughter Marie-Thérèse became the new Ewondo paramount chief. In December 2000, she began the renovation of his palace at Efoulan, Yaoundé, a project that would <b>cost</b> <b>an</b> estimated 150,000,000 francsCFA.|$|E

5|$|On September 15, 2014, Marshall County {{officials}} {{brought the}} extension of I-68 up again {{as a way for}} oil companies to have easier access to drill into the area, likely by fracking. Much like the second leg of the Southern Beltway in the Pittsburgh area, an extension of I-68 is being spurred in response to the Marcellus natural gas trend. If the extension were to be built, it would also include a widening of WV2 to four lanes and would <b>cost</b> <b>an</b> estimated $5 million per mile. It is expected that the project would be divided into two legs, first from Morgantown to Cameron, then Cameron to Moundsville.|$|E
5|$|Prevention {{of malaria}} {{may be more}} {{cost-effective}} than treatment of the disease in the long run, but the initial costs required are {{out of reach of}} many of the world's poorest people. There is a wide difference in the costs of control (i.e. maintenance of low endemicity) and elimination programs between countries. For example, in China—whose government in 2010 announced a strategy to pursue malaria elimination in the Chinese provinces—the required investment is a small proportion of public expenditure on health. In contrast, a similar program in Tanzania would <b>cost</b> <b>an</b> estimated one-fifth of the public health budget.|$|E

Eega is the first Indian film to use computer-generated imagery for nearly 90 minutes of its length; the film had 2,234 live-action animation shots.

5|$|The line {{opened on}} 12 July 1904 {{and at the}} opening there were {{delivered}} two six-axle steam locomotives from Hartmann, which were named Lier and Hole. The railway also took delivery of two passenger cars, a combined freight and conductor car, {{and a number of}} freight cars. Periodically the railway needed extra haulage power, and therefore sometimes leased locomotives from the Norwegian State Railways. The initial fares were NOK1.30 from Lier to Svangstrand, while the ferry across the lake <b>cost</b> <b>an</b> additional NOK1.50. The greatest ridership was during the summer, when tourists took the line to reach the steam ships. During winter, the ridership fell, and the railway terminated at Sylling instead of Svangerstrand.|$|E
