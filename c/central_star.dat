5|$|A white dwarf's stellar and {{planetary}} system is inherited from its progenitor star and may {{interact with the}} white dwarf in various ways. Infrared spectroscopic observations made by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope of the <b>central</b> <b>star</b> of the Helix Nebula suggest {{the presence of a}} dust cloud, which may be caused by cometary collisions. It is possible that infalling material from this may cause X-ray emission from the <b>central</b> <b>star.</b> Similarly, observations made in 2004 indicated the presence of a dust cloud around the young white dwarf G29-38 (estimated to have formed from its AGB progenitor about 500 million years ago), which may have been created by tidal disruption of a comet passing close to the white dwarf. Some estimations based on the metal content of the atmospheres of the white dwarfs consider that at least a 15% of them may be orbited by planets and/or asteroids, or at least their debris. Another suggested idea is that white dwarfs could be orbited by the stripped cores of rocky planets, that would have survived the red giant phase of their star but losing their outer layers and, given those planetary remnants would likely be made of metals, to attempt to detect them looking for the signatures of their interaction with the white dwarf's magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|Located on {{the border}} with Circinus is the unusual {{planetary}} nebula NGC 5189, estimated to be around 1750light-years away from Earth.

Located 2.4° east of Eta Muscae is the magnitude-12.9 Engraved Hourglass Nebula (MyCn18), which lies about 8000 light-years distant from Earth. To Eta's west lies IC 4191, a compact bluish planetary nebula of magnitude 10.6, thought to lie around 10,750 light-years away from Earth.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of <b>central</b> <b>stars</b> of planetary nebulae {{was so far}} documented {{in just a few}} cases. However, spectra collected a few decades ago may provide a good reference for studying the {{evolution of}} <b>central</b> <b>stars</b> using the emission line fluxes of their nebulae. We investigated evolutionary changes of the [OIII] 5007 A line flux in the spectra of planetary nebulae. We compared nebular fluxes collected during a decade or longer. We used literature data and newly obtained spectra. A grid of Cloudy models was computed using existing evolutionary models, and the models were compared with the observations. An increase of the [OIII] 5007 A line flux is frequently observed in young planetary nebulae hosting H-rich <b>central</b> <b>stars.</b> The increasing nebular excitation is the response to the increasing temperature and hardening radiation of the <b>central</b> <b>stars.</b> We did not observe any changes in the nebular fluxes in the planetary nebulae hosting late-type Wolf-Rayet (WR) <b>central</b> <b>stars.</b> This may indicate a slower temperature evolution (which may stem from a different evolutionary status) of late-[WR] stars. In young planetary nebulae with H-rich <b>central</b> <b>stars,</b> the evolution can be followed using optical spectra collected during a decade or longer. The observed evolution of H-rich <b>central</b> <b>stars</b> is consistent with the predictions of the evolutionary models provided in the literature.

5|$|The {{protoplanetary disk}} is an {{accretion}} disk that feeds the <b>central</b> <b>star.</b> Initially very hot, the disk later cools {{in what is}} known as the T tauri star stage; here, formation of small dust grains made of rocks and ice is possible. The grains eventually may coagulate into kilometer-sized planetesimals. If the disk is massive enough, the runaway accretions begin, resulting in the rapid—100,000 to 300,000years—formation of Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos. Near the star, the planetary embryos go through a stage of violent mergers, producing a few terrestrial planets. The last stage takes approximately 100million to a billion years.|$|E
5|$|The {{ultimate}} dissipation of protoplanetary disks is {{triggered by}} a number of different mechanisms. The inner part of the disk is either accreted by the star or ejected by the bipolar jets, whereas the outer part can evaporate under the star's powerful UV radiation during the T Tauri stage or by nearby stars. The gas in the central part can either be accreted or ejected by the growing planets, while the small dust particles are ejected by the radiation pressure of the <b>central</b> <b>star.</b> What is finally left is either a planetary system, a remnant disk of dust without planets, or nothing, if planetesimals failed to form.|$|E
40|$|Aims: Chemical {{compositions}} {{and other}} properties of planetary nebulae around <b>central</b> <b>stars</b> of spectral types [WC], [WO], and wels are {{compared with those}} of `normal' <b>central</b> <b>stars,</b> in order to clarify the evolutionary status of each type and their interrelation.

We also reanalyze the published spectra of a sample of 167 non-WR PN. The results as well as the observational data are compared in detail with those from other studies of the objects in common. Results: The <b>central</b> <b>star's</b> spectral type is clearly correlated with electron density, temperature and excitation class of the nebula, [WC] nebulae tend to be smaller than the other types. All this corroborates the view of an evolutionary sequence from cool [WC 11] <b>central</b> <b>stars</b> inside dense, low excitation nebulae towards hot [WO 1] stars with low density, high excitation nebulae.

40|$|Abstract. The {{characteristics}} of the spectra of weak emission line stars (WELS) {{are found to be}} very similar to that of [WC]-PG 1159 and PG 1159 objects. On the basis of the spectra we find 31 WELS <b>central</b> <b>stars</b> of planetary nebulae to be in fact [WC]-PG 1159 stars. These stars mark the transition from the [WC] <b>central</b> <b>stars</b> of planetary nebulae to the PG 1159 (pre-) white dwarfs. The evolutionary sequence appears to be [WC late]-[WC early]- WELS = [WC]-PG 1159 - PG 1159. The presence of nebulae and dust shells around these stars and also the significant percentage of [WC]-PG 1159 stars among the [WC] <b>central</b> <b>stars</b> of PN indicates that late He-flash scenario may not be the principal mechanism for their post-AGB evolution towards the non-DA white dwarf stage. We found 4 hybrid <b>central</b> <b>stars.</b> They display a HeII/CIV 4650 - 4686 ˚A trough very similar to that of PG 1159 stars.

5|$|Giant planets can {{significantly}} influence terrestrial planet formation. The presence of giants tends to increase eccentricities and inclinations (see Kozai mechanism) of planetesimals and embryos in the terrestrial planet region (inside 4AU in the Solar System). If giant planets form too early, they can slow or prevent inner planet accretion. If they form {{near the end}} of the oligarchic stage, as is thought to have happened in the Solar System, they will influence the merges of planetary embryos, making them more violent. As a result, the number of terrestrial planets will decrease and they will be more massive. In addition, the size of the system will shrink, because terrestrial planets will form closer to the <b>central</b> <b>star.</b> The influence of giant planets in the Solar System, particularly that of Jupiter, is thought to have been limited because they are relatively remote from the terrestrial planets.|$|E

25|$|After a star {{passes through}} the {{asymptotic}} giant branch (AGB) phase, the short planetary nebula phase of stellar evolution begins as gases blow away from the <b>central</b> <b>star</b> at speeds of a few kilometers per second. The <b>central</b> <b>star</b> is the remnant of its AGB progenitor, an electron-degenerate carbon-oxygen core that has lost most of its hydrogen envelope due to mass loss on the AGB. As the gases expand, the <b>central</b> <b>star</b> undergoes a two-stage evolution, first growing hotter as it continues to contract and hydrogen fusion reactions occur in the shell around the core and then slowly cooling when the hydrogen shell is exhausted through fusion and mass loss. In the second phase, it radiates away its energy and fusion reactions cease, as the <b>central</b> <b>star</b> is not heavy enough to generate the core temperatures required for carbon and oxygen to fuse. During the first phase, the <b>central</b> <b>star</b> maintains constant luminosity, {{while at the same}} time it grows ever hotter, eventually reaching temperatures around 100,000K. In the second phase, it cools so much that it does not give off enough ultraviolet radiation to ionize the increasingly distant gas cloud. The star becomes a white dwarf, and the expanding gas cloud becomes invisible to us, ending the planetary nebula phase of evolution. For a typical planetary nebula, about 10,000years passes between its formation and recombination of the star.|$|E

Investigating the spectra we found that 7 of those PNe are ionized by Wolf-Rayet ([WR]) type stars of the very late (VL) spectral class [WC 11] and 8 by weak emission-line (WEL) stars.

40|$|We {{construct}} a speculative scenario for {{the evolution of}} Wolf-Rayet <b>central</b> <b>stars</b> of planetary nebula. It is clear from the latest infra-red observations that a new perspective has to be adopted: the simultaneous presence of carbon- and oxygen-rich dust (double dust chemistry), while being a rare phenomenon for H-rich <b>central</b> <b>stars,</b> is found around the vast majority of cool Wolf-Rayet <b>central</b> <b>stars.</b> This correlation between Wolf-Rayet characteristics and double dust chemistry points to a common mechanism. Within the binary evolution framework established by Soker, two scenarios are proposed, responsible for the majority (80 - 85 %) and minority (15 - 20 %) of Wolf-Rayet <b>central</b> <b>stars.</b> In the first scenario, proposed here for the first time, a low mass main sequence star, brown dwarf or planet spirals into the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) star inducing extra mixing, hence a chemistry change, and terminating the AGB evolution. In the second scenario, previously proposed, a close binary companion is responsible for the formation of a disk around either the binary or the companion. This long-lived disk harbors the O-rich dust. Comment: PASP, in press; 21 page...|$|R
40|$|While {{most of the}} low-mass stars stay hydrogen-rich {{on their}} surface {{throughout}} their evolution, a considerable fraction of white dwarfs as well as <b>central</b> <b>stars</b> of planetary nebulae have a hydrogen-deficient surface composition. The majority of these H-deficient <b>central</b> <b>stars</b> exhibit spectra very similar to massive Wolf-Rayet stars of the carbon sequence, i. e. with broad emission lines of carbon, helium, and oxygen. In analogy to the massive Wolf-Rayet stars, they are classified as [WC] stars. Their formation, which is relatively well understood, {{is thought to be}} the result of a (very) late thermal pulse of the helium burning shell. It is therefore surprising that some H-deficient <b>central</b> <b>stars</b> which have been found recently, e. g.

25|$|These {{mid-range}} stars ultimately {{reach the}} tip of the asymptotic-giant-branch and run out of fuel for shell burning.
