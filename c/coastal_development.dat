5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the onefin {{electric}} ray can defend itself with a strong electric shock produced {{from a pair of}} kidney-shaped electric organs beside its head. It feeds mainly on polychaete worms, and likely gives birth to live young. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks enough information to assess the conservation status of this species.

5|$|The shock {{produced}} by the onefin electric ray can be painful, but is not substantially dangerous to humans. Though not utilized economically, this ray is frequently caught as bycatch in bottom trawls in South African waters. Because of its inshore habits, {{it may also be}} negatively affected by water pollution from <b>coastal</b> <b>development.</b> The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Data Deficient due to lack of specific data, while noting that its vulnerability to fishing and habitat degradation may merit concern.|$|E
5|$|Consensus has {{determined}} sea turtles, including E. imbricata to be, {{at the very}} least, threatened species because of their slow growth and maturity, and slow reproductive rates. Many adult turtles {{have been killed by}} humans, both accidentally and deliberately. Their existence is threatened due to pollution and loss of nesting areas because of <b>coastal</b> <b>development.</b> Biologist guess that the hawkbill population has declined 80 percent in the past hundred years. Human and animal encroachment threatens nesting sites, and small mammals dig up the eggs to eat. In the US Virgin Islands, mongooses raid hawksbill nests (along with those of other sea turtles, such as Dermochelys coriacea) right after they are laid.|$|E
5|$|The Dalmatian pelican is {{the rarest}} species with a {{population}} estimated at between 10,000 and 20,000 following massive declines in the 19th and 20th centuries. The main ongoing threats include hunting, especially in eastern Asia, disturbance, <b>coastal</b> <b>development,</b> collision with overhead power lines and the over-exploitation of fish stocks. It is listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as the population trend is downwards, especially in Mongolia where it is nearly extinct.

The present pilot study demonstrates a novel way of maximising establishment of Amphibolis antarctica seedlings. Seedlings were planted and tethered using an innovative spiral peg, in a bare sand area adjacent to a mature Amphibolis meadow in Shoalwater Bay, Western Australia. Survival and growth were monitored over two years. After two years, 29. 4 % of seedlings survived into well-established mature plants. By enhancing establishment success of seedlings it is anticipated that more rapid and sustainable rehabilitation of Amphibolis seedlings will be possible...|$|R

However, the economic importance of this ray is limited by {{how difficult it is to}} handle. The multi-species coastal fisheries that catch the porcupine ray are largely unregulated, which seems to have resulted in its dramatic decline or local extinction in the Bay of Bengal, the Gulf of Thailand, and likely elsewhere in its range. Potential additional threats to this species include habitat degradation from <b>coastal</b> <b>development,</b> and depletion of its food supply from overfishing. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Vulnerable.|$|E

25|$|Despite its {{commercial}} importance, overall fishery {{statistics for the}} spadenose shark are lacking. A 1996 report {{found it to be}} the most common coastal shark on Chinese markets. Substantial numbers are caught by Indian and Pakistani fisheries; from 1979 to 1981, an average of 823 tons were caught annually off Verval, India. The spadenose shark is also caught as bycatch, particularly in gillnet fisheries off Kalimantan. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as Near Threatened; the spadenose shark's relatively short reproductive cycle may render it more resilient to fishing pressure than other sharks, though its low fecundity still merits caution. This shark may also be negatively affected by <b>coastal</b> <b>development,</b> due to its inshore habitat preferences.|$|E
25|$|Preparing for {{sea-level rise}} can be {{justified}} in many cases, because the cost of preparing now is small compared {{to the cost of}} reacting later.

Nevertheless, preparing for sea-level rise has been {{the exception rather than the}} rule. Most coastal institutions were based on the implicit assumption that sea level and shorelines are stable. Efforts to plan for sea-level rise can be thwarted by several institutional biases, including government policies that encourage <b>coastal</b> <b>development,</b> flood insurance maps that do not consider sea-level rise, federal policies that prefer shoreline armoring over soft shore protection, and lack of plans delineating which areas would be protected or not as sea level rises.|$|E

25|$|Tourism {{became a}} major industry, {{especially}} in the Myrtle Beach area. With its semitropical climate, cheap land and low construction costs (because of low wages), the state became a developer's dream.

The state's attempts to manage <b>coastal</b> <b>development</b> in an orderly and environmentally sound manner have run afoul of federal court decisions. The U.S. Supreme Court (in Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council) ruled that the state, in forbidding construction on threatened beachfront property, had, in effect, seized the plaintiff's property without due process of law. The rush to build upscale housing along the coast paid its price in {{the billions of dollars}} of losses as Hurricane Hugo swept through on September 21–22, 1989.

40|$|Considerable {{information}} {{is available on the}} global impacts of coastal climate change. However, on a country-scale, and even more importantly, on a local and community-scale there exists significant data uncertainties and insufficiencies. The Sydney Greater Metropolitan Region (GMR) is no exception to this issue. Coastal climate change effects, such as sea level rise and the increase in storm magnitude, have the potential to progressively impact Sydney's growing <b>coastal</b> population and <b>developments</b> over the coming decades. The focus of this paper is on the implications of climate change to <b>coastal</b> <b>developments</b> within the Sydney GMR, the current planning, adaptation and mitigation responses, and the current implementation of these responses at the local government level. A survey was undertaken, by email, to the sixteen member councils of the Sydney Coastal Councils Group to establish the extent of information on coastal climate change impacts available at the local government level, and to determine how (or if) this {{information is}} utilised in planning and management responses for <b>coastal</b> <b>developments.</b> It was concluded {{that the majority of the}} seven coastal council authorities that responded have not readily considered the implications of coastal climate change impacts within their coastal zones. It is recommended that vulnerability and risk assessments should be undertaken within specific coastal regions to determine the effects that. coastal climate change will have. Most importantly, appropriate adaptation and mitigation procedures need to be implemented at the local level, and there needs to be ongoing evaluation and readjustments of these procedures to ensure future changes are adequately planned. 8 page(s...|$|R
