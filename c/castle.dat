William constructed a motte-and-bailey <b>castle</b> during the 1070s, protected by large earthwork ramparts, with a large country house in the centre of the motte. Soon after, a small community of Cluniac monks were given the castle's chapel in the outer bailey; under William, the second earl, the order was given land and estates to establish <b>Castle</b> Acre Priory alongside the <b>castle.</b> A deer park was created nearby for hunting.|$|E

5|$|Farleigh Hungerford <b>Castle,</b> {{sometimes}} called Farleigh <b>Castle</b> or Farley <b>Castle,</b> is a medieval <b>castle</b> in Farleigh Hungerford, Somerset, England. The <b>castle</b> {{was built in}} two phases: the inner court was constructed between 1377 and 1383 by Sir Thomas Hungerford, who made his fortune working as a steward to John of Gaunt. The <b>castle</b> was built to a quadrangular design, already slightly old-fashioned, {{on the site of}} an existing manor house overlooking the River Frome. A park was attached to the <b>castle,</b> requiring the destruction of a local village. His son, Sir Walter Hungerford, a successful knight and courtier to Henry V, became rich during the Hundred Years War with France and extended the <b>castle</b> with an additional, outer court, enclosing the parish church in the process. By Walter's death in 1449, the substantial <b>castle</b> was richly appointed and its chapel decorated with murals.|$|E

5|$|Himeji <b>Castle</b> {{dates to}} 1333, when Akamatsu Norimura built a fort {{on top of}} Himeyama hill. The fort was {{dismantled}} and rebuilt as Himeyama <b>Castle</b> in 1346, and then remodeled into Himeji <b>Castle</b> two centuries later. Himeji <b>Castle</b> was then significantly remodeled in 1581 by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who added a three-story <b>castle</b> keep. In 1600, Tokugawa Ieyasu awarded the <b>castle</b> to Ikeda Terumasa for his help in the Battle of Sekigahara, and Ikeda completely rebuilt the <b>castle</b> from 1601 to 1609, expanding it into a large <b>castle</b> complex. Several buildings were later added to the <b>castle</b> complex by Honda Tadamasa from 1617 to 1618. For over 400 years, Himeji <b>Castle</b> has remained intact, even throughout the extensive bombing of Himeji in World War II, and natural disasters such as the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake.|$|E

5|$|In September 2001, Studio Ghibli {{announced}} {{the production of}} two films. The first would become The Cat Returns and the second was an adaptation of Diana Wynne Jones' novel, Howl's Moving <b>Castle.</b> A rumor persists that Miyazaki had an idea to do Howl's Moving <b>Castle</b> {{during a visit to}} Strasbourg Christmas market. Toshio Suzuki, who produced Howl's Moving <b>Castle,</b> stated that Miyazaki was inspired to make the film when he read Jones' novel, and was struck by the image of a <b>castle</b> moving around the countryside. The novel does not explain how the <b>castle</b> moved, and Miyazaki was interested in figuring out how the <b>castle</b> might move, which led to the image of a <b>castle</b> on chicken legs. The complex moving <b>castle</b> changes and rearranges itself several times throughout the movie in response to Howl's eccentricity and the various situations. The basic structure of the <b>castle</b> consists of more than 80 elements including turrets, a wagging tongue, cogwheels and chicken legs, that were rendered as digital objects.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unclear}} if the <b>castle</b> and town played any {{part in the}} English Civil War between 1642–45, {{although}} cannonballs from the period have been discovered within the <b>castle.</b> Local oral tradition states that the <b>castle</b> was slighted, or deliberately destroyed, during the war. Stones from the <b>castle</b> were used for local building work by the 17th century onwards, and by the 18th century a house and shop had been constructed in the eastern bailey of the <b>castle,</b> along with a yard and garden. A gallows operated at the <b>castle</b> until 1790. Buildings continued to encroach on the <b>castle.</b> By {{the end of the}} 19th century a school and a house, <b>Castle</b> Lodge, had been built in the <b>castle</b> grounds.
