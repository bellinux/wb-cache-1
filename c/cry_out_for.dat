500|$|Thomas Hopley, aged 41 at {{the time}} of the incident, was a {{schoolmaster}} in Eastbourne who ran a private boarding school out of his home at 22 Grand-parade. [...] He was well educated and from a middle-class family, the son of a Royal Navy surgeon and brother of artist Edward Hopley. [...] His household was fairly well off, and he and his wife kept several servants. [...] Hopley was described by Algernon Charles Swinburne as [...] "a person of high attainments and irreproachable character". [...] He expressed [...] "utopian" [...] educational ideals shared by many Victorian educational theorists. He wrote pamphlets on education topics which included [...] "Lectures on the Education of Man", [...] "Help towards the physical, intellectual and moral elevation of all classes of society", and [...] "Wrongs which <b>cry</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> redress" [...] advocating the abolition of child labour.|$|E

[...] That same year, Lucas Sullivan of GamesRadar named it as number one top [...] "cult-classic franchise" [...] that should be rebooted in a way Prince of Persia was, commenting that [...] "despite a small cast of characters, minimalist gameplay, and some truly grueling difficulty, Another World... resonated with gamers in ways they weren't expecting. The game's vivid vector graphics were utterly stunning at the time, and the pacing of the heavy, nicely animated platforming naturally melded with taking in the sights of the sublime alien landscape," [...] and adding that [...] "slowly adapting to the hostile surroundings offered a hard-earned satisfaction and a surprisingly moving story." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Walzer {{claimed that}} the growth of {{religious}} toleration in Western nations arose amongst other things, from the general recognition that private conscience signified some inner divine presence regardless of the religious faith professed and from the general respectability, piety, self-limitation, and sectarian discipline which marked {{most of the men}} who claimed the rights of conscience. Walzer also argued that attempts by courts to define conscience as a merely personal moral code or as sincere belief, risked encouraging an anarchy of moral egotisms, unless such a code and motive was necessarily tempered with shared moral knowledge: derived either from the connection of the individual to a universal spiritual order, or from the common principles and mutual engagements of unselfish people. Ronald Dworkin maintains that constitutional protection of freedom of conscience is central to democracy but creates personal duties to live up to it: [...] "Freedom of conscience presupposes a personal responsibility of reflection, and it loses much of its meaning when that responsibility is ignored. A good life need not be an especially reflective one; most of the best lives are just lived rather than studied. But there are moments that <b>cry</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> self-assertion, when a passive bowing to fate or a mechanical decision out of deference or convenience is treachery, because it forfeits dignity for ease." [...] Edward Conze stated it is important for individual and collective moral growth that we recognise the illusion of our conscience being wholly located in our body; indeed both our conscience and wisdom expand when we act in an unselfish way and conversely [...] "repressed compassion results in an unconscious sense of guilt." ...|$|E

500|$|Jody Rosen from Rolling Stone gave a mixed {{review of}} the album, {{wondering}} why the remix album was necessary {{to be released in}} the first place. She nevertheless added that [...] "he album has some diverting moments. Goldfrapp's down-tempo 'Judas' is less a remix than a smart cover, and the Weeknd and Illangelo re-imagine 'Marry the Night' as a strobe-y, atmospheric R epic. But there are two or three duds for each winner—like the bludgeoning 'Scheiße', a gratuitous exercise that strives to make a dance-floor thumper out of a song that was born that way." [...] Rosen's view was shared by Paul Rice from Slant Magazine, who gave the album a rating of two out of five stars. Rice's main complaint was that [...] "ertain artists <b>cry</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the remix treatment more than others, usually those whose vocal talents are relatively straightforward and could benefit from the extra fuss." [...] He added that Gaga was not such an artist and that the original Born This Way album [...] "in particular, is too big and untamed, full of too many of its own references and styles, from Springsteen to Madonna. As such, it's best enjoyed on its own flawed, bombastic terms." [...] Nick Levine, reviewing the album for BBC Music felt that most of the tracks are already available as digital downloads and CD singles, [...] "so it's easy to dismiss Born This Way: The Remix as inessential and, yes, a cash-in. But taken as a whole, this release offers enough revelations to suggest the original album is worth revisiting. That additional purpose, whether intentional or not, feels at least partly fulfilled." [...] Levine complimented The Weeknd and Twin Shadow's remixes, while criticizing Foster the People and Sultan & Ned Shepard for their predictable remixes.|$|E

2500|$|Richard Lancelyn Green, {{the editor}} of the 2000 Oxford {{paperback}} edition of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, surmises that Doyle's source for the story appears to have been the article named [...] "Called on by a Boa Constrictor. A West African Adventure" [...] in Cassell's Saturday Journal, published in February 1891. In the article, a captain tells how he was dispatched to a remote camp in West Africa to stay in a tumbledown cabin that belonged to a Portuguese trader. [...] On the first night in the cabin, he is awoken by a creaking sound, and sees [...] "a dark queer-looking thing hanging down through the ventilator above it". It {{turns out to be the}} largest Boa constrictor he has seen (more likely a python because there are no boas in Africa). He is paralysed with fear as the serpent comes down into the room. Unable to <b>cry</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> help, the captain spots an old bell that hung from a projecting beam above one of the windows. The bell cord had rotted away, but by means of a stick he manages to ring it and raise the alarm.|$|E
2500|$|By the 1950s Australia was gripped {{in a red}} scare {{similar to}} that which led to McCarthyism in the United States. Attempts by the Liberal Prime Minister Robert Menzies to outlaw the Communist Party of Australia were {{overturned}} in the High Court of Australia (see Australian Communist Party v Commonwealth) and defeated at a referendum in 1951. Members {{on both sides of}} the Australian House of Representatives advocated severing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. Relations between Australia and the Soviet Union hit a low point when Vladimir Petrov, the Third Secretary of the Soviet embassy in Canberra, an associate and appointee of Lavrentiy Beria who feared execution if he returned to the Soviet Union, defected at the end of his three-year assignment on 3 April 1954 with the help of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and was given political asylum. The defection, which became known as the Petrov Affair, was disclosed by Menzies on 13 April 1954, the eve of the last day of Parliament before the May federal election. In his notice to Parliament Menzies disclosed that Petrov was an agent of the MVD and turned over to the Australian authorities details of Soviet intelligence operations in Australia, and announced intention for a Royal Commission to investigate Petrov's information, which included allegations of a Soviet fifth column being created in Australia. The revelations shocked the Australian public, which was more attuned to such things happening overseas. It was also reported that Evdokia Petrova, Petrov's wife and fellow MVD agent, had decided to stay with the Soviet Embassy in Canberra, and on 14 April, Petrova and Nikolai Generalov, the Soviet ambassador, accused Australian security services of kidnapping Petrov. On 19 April, the affair took another twist when Petrova was being escorted onto a waiting BOAC Constellation at Kingsford Smith Airport by Soviet diplomatic couriers for a flight back to the Soviet Union. William Wentworth took statutory declarations from Russian and Czechoslovakian anti-communists in the crowd who had stormed the tarmac to prevent Petrova from leaving, that they had heard her say Petrova calling out in Russian [...] "I do not want to go. Save me", and asked Menzies to make the aircraft stop at Darwin in order to ask Petrova whether she wanted to leave Australia. Contrary to reports, Petrova did not <b>cry</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> help at Sydney Airport, but the aircraft did stop at Darwin Airport on a scheduled fuel-stop, enabling Australian security services to interview Petrova. After talking to Reginald Sylvester Leydin, the Government secretary, and to her husband on the phone, Petrova accepted the Australian government's offer of asylum and defected. The Soviets accused the Menzies government of manufacturing the defection of Petrov as an election stunt, ostensibly to boost his support in the upcoming elections, and on 21 April they also levelled against Petrov charges that he had misappropriated Embassy funds. Menzies dismissed the allegations, stating that he was waiting for such charges to be levelled as they were in the Gouzenko case in Canada, and also went on to say he believed the charges contradicted the Soviets' initial allegation that Petrov was kidnapped. The Australian government refused to hand over Petrov, who was deemed by the Soviets to be a criminal, and the Soviet government responded on 23 April 1954 by severing diplomatic relations with Australia, which saw the Soviet Embassy in Canberra being recalled and the Australian Embassy in Moscow being expelled. The Soviet decision was not unexpected, as it was thought by the Australian government to have been one possible response, but the swiftness of the decision was said to have shocked government advisers. The severance of diplomatic relations led to rumours that the Soviet Olympic team would not compete at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. In the absence of diplomatic relations, the Soviet Union's interests in Australia were represented by Sweden, and Australia's interests in the Soviet Union were represented by the United Kingdom.|$|E
