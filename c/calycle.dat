40|$|Hibiscus mutabilis L. is {{originally}} {{distributed in}} central China and often cultivated in Japan as a gardenplant. The naturalized population was investigated at outskirts of Nagasaki City. The shrubs {{of the species}} grow along the river and total number of individuals more than I m height was about 100. The Hibiscus mutabilis dominant community was phytosociologically investigated. The community is ruderal and is constantly associated with Debregearia edulis and Arudo donax in shrub layer and Miscanthus sinensis, Solidago altissima and Microlepia strigosa in herb layer. Ten floral characters were measured in five individuals randomly selected: petal length,petal width, style length, anther-stigma distance, anther-anther distance, style lobe length, number of stamens (anthers),number of <b>calycle</b> lobes, <b>calycle</b> lobe width and dry floral weight. The floral variations was little. These facts indicate that this population might originate from a plant accidentally introduced here...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Nitrogen is an {{essential}} element forplants and in combination withelements such as carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and sulfur results ineven more valuable materials such as amino acids, nucleic acids, alkaloids. Hibiscus tea (Hibiscus sabdariffa) from Malvaceaefamily is known by different names {{in different parts of}} the world. In Iran it is calledthe Maki tea, tea Meccaorred tea. As an important plant,it is decided to investigate its growth and development in Jiroft. Materials and Methods The experiment was conducted as factorial based on randomized complete block design with three replications in farm research of Islamic Azad University of Jiroft during 2010. The first factor was nitrogen foliar application in four levels (0, 1, 2 and 3 percent) and second factor was foliar application of zinc at twolevels (0 and 1 percent). The measured quantitative characteristics were stem diameter, plant height, <b>calycle</b> fresh weight,calycle dry weight, plant fresh weight,plant dry weight, leaf fresh weight,leaf dry weight, mucilage percentage and mucilage yield. Results and Discussion:The results of ANOVA showed that nitrogen foliar application on leaf dry weight, <b>calycle</b> fresh and dry weight was effective. Plant fresh weight, dry weight, stem diameter, plant height, mucilage percentageandmucilage yield showedsignificanteffects. Zinc foliar application significantly affected leaf fresh weight,leafdry weight, <b>calycle</b> fresh weight, plant fresh weight,plant dry weight, mucilage percentage andmucilage yield. The interaction effect of nitrogen and zinc on leaf dry weight, plant freshweight and plant dry weight was also significant. The mean comparison of studied characteristics revealed that byincreasing the amount of nitrogen up to N 2 level, the stem diameter, plant height, leaf dry weight, <b>calycle</b> dry weight, mucilage percentage and yield increased but there was no significant difference between N 2 and N 3 levels. Plant fresh weight and plantdry weight increased with increasing amountof nitrogen up to N 3 level. Theapplication of zinc fertilizer significantly increased the plant fresh weigh, plant dry weight, mucilage percentage and yield. The interactions of nitrogen and zinc improved the <b>calycle,</b> leaf dry weight, plant dry weight, and the highest <b>calycle</b> dry weight were achieved from N 2 Zn 1 and N 3 Zn 1 treatments. The results showed that any givenlevel of nitrogen fertilizer and zinc fertilizer increased growth, yieldand quantitative traits of Hibiscus tea, but the level of interaction between nitrogen and zinc fertilizer hada significant effect on growth traits of Hibiscus tea, and even reduced the growth and yield of quantitative traits. The nitrogen and the fertilizer mixture of nitrogen and zinc had a significant influence on Hibiscus tea quantitative traits. Nitrogen fertilizer with a higher level of performance and yield had the greatest effect on Hibiscus tea. The greatest impact of nitrogen fertilizer, zinc fertilizer and the fertilizer mixture of nitrogen and zinc on sepal fresh weight were 215. 481 gr, 209. 935 gr and 216. 893 gr respectively. The effect of nitrogen fertilizer, zinc fertilizer and fertilizer mixture of nitrogen and zinc on leaf fresh weight,leaf dry weight andsepals dry weight were 61. 787 gr 13. 378 gr and 19. 482 gr respectively. Conclusion The results of this study showed thatin order to increase crop yield and quality,nitrogen fertilizer and spraying of manure on Hibiscus tea is recommended. Because of having useful properties in the treatment of diabetes, as well as the climate and soil conditions of Jiroft area, this plant is grown as a medicinal plant at a large scale. Since Jiroft region is a suitable place for growth of Hibiscus tea and due to the importance of medicinal plants, it recommend that this experiment should be repeated to evaluateplant characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Summary Aim of study: To {{study the}} {{vibration}} sensitivity (VS) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) {{depending on the}} clinical peculiarities of the disease. Material and methods: The study included 67 pts (M:F= 7 : 60) with reliable RA (ARA criteria, 1987). 55 out of 67 pts were positive on rheumatoid factor (RF), 20 pts had the 1 st stage of activity, 32 - 2 nd, 15 - 3 d, corticosteroids were taken by 21 pts. Study of vibration sensitivity was done by electronic biotensiometer (EG Electronic, USA) in three points of lower extremities: dorsal foot surface, front al crural surface {{in the area of}} tibia bone crest in medial tertiary> level, knee <b>calycle.</b> Results: Frequency of VS disturbance was measured in parallel with clinical and laboratory indices and was in case of the 1 st stage of activity 40 %, in 2 nd - 75 % and in 3 d - 93. 3 %. It was found that VS changing in great majority of cases allows to diagnose the lesion of peripheral nervous system as compared with other clinical changes. Assessing VS dynamics {{in the course of the}} therapy on the clinical stage and using NSAIDs and intraarticular injections of corticosteroids was not accompanied by the reliable dynamics of the index understudy. Clinical improvement of articular syndrome and disappearing of systemic manifestations was not associated with the improvement of VS indices. Conclusion: VS disturbance in RA pts is associated with the stage of activity and severity of the disease. Association of VS disturbance with systemic manifestations enables us to study VS in RA as an additional diagnostical test of revealing of systemic symptoms...|$|E
