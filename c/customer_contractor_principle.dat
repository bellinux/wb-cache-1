Data collected from service-support projects within the legal and defence services sectors is analysed and demonstrates that five key constructs are required when devising an effective QMS for a service-support project.

Building on a communication satellite innovation metric and a spacecraft innovation framework developed {{as part of an}} ongoing project, this paper presents a preliminary model of communication satellite innovation. In addition to innovation being a function of the rate of performance normalized by price, innovation was found to be strongly influenced by characteristics of the customer-contractor contractual relationship. Specifically, DoD contracts tend to result in a lower level of innovation on average as compared to other customers and particular customer-contractor pairs perform differently and exhibit a second order relationship in time.

40|$|Extract][10. 05] Dispute {{resolution}} in the workplace covers a range of conflicts, processes and regulatory frameworks. Broadly speaking, {{there are two main}} categories of conflicts affecting organisations: internal conflicts, between employees and between employees and management; and external conflicts, between the organisation and/or its representatives and outsiders such as clients, <b>customers,</b> <b>contractors</b> or regulatory bodies. This chapter will focus on the first category, conflict within the workplace. Conflict is prevalent within workplaces, and recent research has demonstrated that managing conflict is a time-consuming and costly exercise for organisations and their managers. The types of conflicts that might arise within an organisation include: conflicts between employees (based on differences in personality, work styles, goals, etc); conflicts between an employee and a manager about performance issues; and conflicts between groups of employees (perhaps represented by a union) and management about working conditions and pay. Particular types of workplace conflict might include issues of bullying and harassment, discrimination, and unfair dismissal, as well as more minor conflicts between employees around day-to-day workplace activities and personality differences...|$|R

40|$|Changing {{environment}} makes enterpreneurs think differently, work closer {{with all}} stakeholders and respond quickly to customer needs, including {{those which are}} family-run. These are often focused on building their value {{in the long term}} and forget about increasing flexibility. Question how to combine the traditional style of management which is faithful to tradition and family values with a very clear challenge of maintaining business agility becomes {{one of the most important}} questions of every manager and business owner. Adding existing specific 0 interrelationship between the business and the founding family, makes the management process in a family business very emotional and even more difficult. This process is most clearly evident where the values of the owner, founder and family merge. The founder’s values, which interweave with the values of the family system he / she belongs to, determine the choice of corporate mission and strategy, as well as the way in which company employees communicate with all external stakeholders (<b>customers,</b> <b>contractors,</b> suppliers and other business partners).

40|$|At Fort Polk, LA {{an entire}} city (4, 003 {{military}} family housing units) is being converted to geothermal heat pumps (GHP) under a performance contract. At the same time other efficiency measures such as compact fluorescent lights (CFLs), low-flow water outlets, and attic insulation are being installed. If these contracts and this technology are to be used widely in US Department of Defense (DoD) facilities and other public buildings, better data from actual projects is the key. Being the first GHP project of this type and size, Fort Polk proved to be very challenging for all concerned. To get from RFP to start of construction took several years. This hard work by others created a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to address many of the due diligence issues that delayed the Fort Polk project. So that future projects can move faster, an evaluation has been undertaken to address the following barriers: absence of a documented large-scale demonstration of GHP energy, demand, and maintenance savings (a barrier to acceptance by federal <b>customers,</b> performance <b>contractors,</b> and investors); newness of large-scale facility capital renewal procurements at federal facilities under energy savings performance contracts (ESPCs) or traditional appropriations (lack of case studies); and variability in current GHP design tools (increases risks and costs for federal <b>customers,</b> performance <b>contractors,</b> investors and designers).

Assessment of individual safety management activities could reduce many losses. Present study aimed to evaluate the safety management of a household appliance manufacturing company.  . Material and Method: This study has done in a household appliance manufacturing company in Damavand city. Two questionnaires were firstly designed based on the weighted scores. The questionnaire 1 consisted of 4 indicators: Safety of machinery, Electrical safety, Risk assessment and Fire safety. Questionnaire 2 consisted of 11 sub indicators. Both questionnaires were completed by 30 HSE experts and supervisors. Reliability of questionnaires was based on cronbachs alpha coefficient. the safety status of each unit was determined and scored using information acquired by the questionnaires. Lastly, {{the safety of the}} entire company was determined.  . Result: Results showed that in safety management: the pressing and store house were in a good range of 66. 66 and 60. 12 points. Powder painting, enameling, laboratory were in a average range of 56. 25, 55. 92 and 54. 15 points. Assembling and door storage were in a week range of 46. 06 points.  . Conclusion: The findings showed that the safety status in the studied appliances company is in average range with 55. 45 points.
