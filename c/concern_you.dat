500|$|On December 28 at 2:56p.m., Alcorn's mother, Carla Wood Alcorn, {{posted a}} public {{message on the}} social media website Facebook, stating: [...] "My sweet 16-year-old son, Joshua Ryan Alcorn, went home to Heaven this morning. He was out for an early morning walk and {{was hit by a}} truck. Thank you for the {{messages}} and kindness and <b>concern</b> <b>you</b> have sent our way. Please continue to keep us in your prayers." [...] Carla Alcorn's post was subsequently deleted, and her Facebook account was made private. The Alcorn family publicly requested that they be given privacy to grieve in a statement issued by the Kings Local School District. In that statement, staff from Alcorn's former school, Kings High School, declared that [...] "Joshua Alcorn was a sweet, talented, tender-hearted 17-year-old", adding that counselors would be made available to students affected by the incident. A moment of silence was held in Alcorn's memory before a Kings High basketball game on December 30.|$|E
500|$|A Bengali by birth, Shankar {{had already}} brought the growing {{humanitarian}} crisis in Bangladesh to Harrison's attention, while {{staying at the}} ex-Beatle's house, Friar Park, earlier in the year. The state formerly known as East Pakistan (and before that, East Bengal) had suffered an estimated 300,000 casualties when the Bhola cyclone hit its shores on 12 November 1970, and the indifference shown by the ruling government in West Pakistan, particularly by President Yahya Khan, was just one reason the Bengali national movement sought independence on 25 March 1971. This declaration resulted in an immediate military crackdown by Khan's troops, and three days later the Bangladesh Liberation War began. By 13 June, details of the systematic massacre of citizens were beginning to emerge internationally via the publication in London's Sunday Times of an article by Anthony Mascarenhas. Along with the torrential rains and intensive flooding that were threatening the passage of millions of refugees into north-eastern India, this news galvanised Shankar into approaching Harrison for help in trying to alleviate the suffering. [...] "I was in a very sad mood, having read all this news," [...] Shankar later told Rolling Stone magazine, [...] "and I said, 'George, this is the situation, I know it doesn't <b>concern</b> <b>you,</b> I know you can't possibly identify.' But while I talked to George he was very deeply moved... and he said, 'Yes, I think I'll {{be able to do}} something.'" ...|$|E
