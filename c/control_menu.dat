5000|$|Nightlong is {{predominantly}} an inventory management type of game, {{with a few}} puzzles thrown in. The game has backgrounds {{that appear to be}} a mixture of texture-mapped and hand-drawn graphics. The game is played mostly from the third-person perspective, and game characters are cyberpuppets. Background music and sound effects are unobtrusive. The navigation interface uses left-click to examine an object, right-click to use, interact with or combine objects in the game or in inventory. Hotspots are indicated with on-screen text. Many of the game's plot elements rely on finding a single object. For this amount of pixel hunting, a large-screen monitor is recommended. An inventory bar is accessible {{at the bottom of the}} screen, and the Escape key is used for the game <b>control</b> <b>menu.</b> The Escape key can also be used to skip video and dialog sequences, and right-clicking on screen exits avoids waiting for character walking. Useful [...] "Go to..." [...] text indicates previously-unexplored exits. A handy instant-navigation feature is also available for part of the game.|$|E

While empirical evaluations showed a speed advantage for ToolGlass, {{they did not}} examine {{the relative importance of}} two possible factors in its improved performance: (1) the use of two hands and (2) the merging of command selection and direct manipulation. We conducted a study comparing the relative benefits of three command selection techniques that merge command selection and direct manipulation: one two-handed technique, Toolglass, and two one-handed techniques, namely, <b>control</b> <b>menus</b> [Pook et al. 2000] and FlowMenu [Guimbretière and Winograd 2000]. Participants performed sequences of operations that required both selecting a color and designating the endpoints of a line.

40|$|Consider a {{firm with}} an {{arbitrary}} profit function whose relative price follows a Brownian motion with negative drift. When the firm faces a fixed cost of price adjustment, we prove the optimal pricing {{policy is a}} control band if the following sufficient conditions are met: the profit function is continuous, strictly concave and single-peaked; moreover, together with its first and second derivatives, it is bounded in absolute value by a polynomial. We also demonstrate various ways of constructing the value function associated with the control band policy and show it has certain properties carried over from the profit function. Numerical examples {{are found to be}} consistent with empirical estimates regarding the frequency of price adjustments. (Copyright: Elsevier) stochastic <b>control,</b> <b>menu</b> cost...|$|E
40|$|Many {{interactive}} {{computer systems}} use menus {{as an important}} part of their interface. Menus allow users to select operations but not to control their execution. A second interactor, such as a dialog box, has to be used to control the chosen operation and thus complete the interaction. This decomposition of what is a single action from the user's point of view into two distinct steps slows down interaction with computer systems. This thesis proposes a new contextual pop-up menu, called a <b>Control</b> <b>Menu,</b> that includes proportional control of the chosen operation with immediate feedback. Using this menu gives a more fluid control of complex interfaces and has the advantage of an expert form of use that is very similar to, and thus easily learnt from, the novice usage...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new kind of marking menu that was {{developed}} for use with a pen device on display surfaces such as large, high resolution, wall-mounted displays. It integrates capabilities of previously separate mechanisms such as marking menus and Quikwriting, and facilitates the entry of multiple commands. While using this menu, the pen never has to leave the active surface so that consecutive menu selections, data entry (text and parameters) and direct manipulation tasks can be integrated fluidly.

40|$|Zoomable User Interfaces (ZUIs) are {{difficult}} to use on large information spaces {{in part because they}} provide insufficient context. Even after a short period of navigation users no longer know where they are in the information space nor where to find the information they are looking for. We propose a temporary in-place context aid that helps users position themselves in ZUIs. This context layer is a transparent view of the context that is drawn over the users ’ focus of attention. A second temporary in-place aid is proposed {{that can be used to}} view already visited regions of the information space. This history layer is an overlapping transparent layer that adds a history mechanism to ZUIs. We complete these orientation aids with an additional window, a hierarchy tree, that shows users the structure of the information space and their current position within it. Context layers show users their position, history layers show them how they got there, and hierarchy trees show what information is available and where it is. ZUIs, especially those that include these new orientation aids, {{are difficult}} to use with standard interaction techniques. They provide a large number of commands which must be used frequently and on a changing image. The mouse and its buttons cannot provide a rapid access to all these commands without new interaction techniques. We propose a new type of menu, a <b>control</b> <b>menu,</b> that facilitates the use of ZUIs and which we feel can also be useful in other types of applications. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Although point-of-purchase calorie {{labeling}} {{at restaurants}} {{has been proposed}} as a strategy for improving consumer food choices, {{a limited number of}} studies have evaluated this approach. Likewise, little research has been conducted to evaluate the influence of value size pricing on restaurant meal choices. Methods To examine the effect of point-of-purchase calorie information and value size pricing on fast food meal choices a randomized 2 × 2 factorial experiment was conducted in which participants ordered a fast food meal from one of four menus that varied with respect to whether calorie information was provided and whether value size pricing was used. Study participants included 594 adolescents and adults who regularly ate at fast food restaurants. Study staff recorded the foods ordered and consumed by each participant. Participants also completed surveys to assess attitudes, beliefs and practices related to fast food and nutrition. Results No significant differences in the energy composition of meals ordered or eaten were found between menu conditions. The average energy content of meals ordered by those randomized to a menu that included calorie information and did not include value size pricing was 842 kcals compared with 827 kcals for those who ordered their meal from a menu that did not include calorie information but had value size pricing (<b>control</b> <b>menu).</b> Results were similar in most analyses conducted stratified by factors such as age, race and education level. Conclusion Additional research is needed to better evaluate the effects of calorie labeling and value size pricing on fast food meal choices. Studies in which participants are repeatedly exposed to these factors are needed since long term exposure may be required for behavior change. </p...|$|E
