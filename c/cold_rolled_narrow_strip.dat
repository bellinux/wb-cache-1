5000|$|Roll {{slitting}} is {{a shearing}} operation that cuts a large roll of material into <b>narrower</b> <b>rolls.</b> There {{are two types}} of slitting: log slitting and rewind slitting. In log slitting the roll of material is treated as a whole (the 'log') and one or more slices are taken from it without an unrolling/re-reeling process. In rewind slitting the web is unwound and run through the machine, passing through knives or lasers, before being rewound on one or more shafts to form <b>narrower</b> <b>rolls.</b> The multiple <b>narrower</b> <b>strips</b> of material may be known as mults (short for multiple) or pancakes if their diameter is much more than their width. For rewind slitting the machine used is called a slitter rewinder, a slitter or a slitting machine - these names are used interchangeably for the same machines. [...] For particularly narrow & thin products the pancakes become unstable, and then the rewind may be onto a bobbin-wound reel: the rewind bobbins are much wider than the slit width and the web oscillates across the reel as it is rewound. Apart from the stability benefit it is also then possible to put very long lengths, (frequently many tens of kilometres), onto one bobbin.|$|R

The results show that this method can reliably predict the mechanical performance of <b>cold</b> <b>rolled</b> ribbed steel bars, and the predictive effect of the 5 -in & 1 -out RBF network model based on whole variable space is superior to the 5 -in & 2 -out RBF network model...|$|R

This influence is researched using hydraulic drawing of <b>cold</b> <b>rolled</b> sheet steel with previous derived ellipse shaped openings placed in the directions of plane anisotropy. The research aims to show how the position of the previous derived ellipse holes can influence on improving the processing of the <b>cold</b> <b>rolled</b> sheet steel and that will help to solve technological problems in the production when the method of drawing the <b>cold</b> <b>rolled</b> sheet steel with previous derived holes in the starting material is used. ...|$|R

Billets are hot or <b>cold</b> <b>rolled</b> into bars, rods, and wire. [...] Blooms are hot or <b>cold</b> <b>rolled</b> into {{structural}} steel, such as I-beams and rails. [...] In modern steel mills these processes often occur in one assembly line, with ore {{coming in and}} finished steel products coming out. Sometimes after a steel's final rolling it is heat treated for strength, however this is relatively rare.|$|R

40|$|Abstract A {{squeeze casting}} 15 vol. %SiCw/Al and pure {{aluminum}} were <b>cold</b> <b>rolled</b> to 50 pct reduction in thickness and then annealed at 500 °C for 1 h. The textures of the treated materials were examined using XRD. The dominant texture {{components in the}} <b>cold</b> <b>rolled</b> composites consisted of { 112 }、{ 100 } and { 123 } and were much weaker {{than those in the}} <b>cold</b> <b>rolled</b> aluminum. The new texture components in annealed composites were { 211 }、{ 013 } and { 011 } and had the similar intensity as those remained from the deformation state. This indicated that the recovery reaction and recrystallization occurred simultaneously when the <b>cold</b> <b>rolled</b> composite was annealed at 500 °C. Also, the annealing texture was much weaker in the composite than that in the aluminum. The weaker deformation and annealing textures in the composites {{can be attributed to the}} introduction of the whiskers...|$|R

Microstructure evolution during ECAP and subsequent annealing was investigated. The deformed and annealed states were characterized by EBSD, TEM and microhardness tests.

The study revealed a very low thermal stability of ECAP deformed pure Cu samples compared to <b>cold</b> <b>rolled</b> material with same total strain.
