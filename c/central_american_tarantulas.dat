5000|$|Harpactira pulchripes is {{a bright}} yellow bodied and {{metallic}} blue legged tarantula found in South Africa. [...] It is a very highly desired tarantula in the European and <b>American</b> <b>tarantula</b> keeping hobby.|$|R
50|$|This spider can {{be up to}} 6 inch cm long, {{the males}} black and females dark brown. Like most North <b>American</b> <b>tarantulas,</b> they are {{relatively}} harmless to humans, unlikely to bite and with venom only mildly irritating.|$|R

50|$|The new {{categorization}} of this spider {{is part of}} an effort to more carefully catalog <b>American</b> <b>tarantula</b> species. For decades there has been a suspicion that there are more species than identified, but that they are similar enough to be overlooked. The new effort has broken them down according to behavior and observable traits, though there has not been genetic testing done to truly ascertain where the species lines are drawn.|$|R
40|$|Psalmotoxin 1, a peptide {{extracted}} from the South <b>American</b> <b>tarantula</b> Psalmopoeus cambridgei, has very potent analgesic properties against thermal, mechanical, chemical, inflammatory and neuropathic pain in rodents. It exerts its action by blocking acid-sensing ion channel 1 a, and this blockade results in an activation of the endogenous enkephalin pathway. The analgesic properties of the peptide are suppressed by antagonists of the mu and delta-opioid receptors and are lost in Penk 1 (-/-) mice...|$|R
50|$|Most {{species of}} North <b>American</b> <b>tarantulas</b> are brown. Elsewhere {{species have been}} found that {{variously}} display cobalt blue (Cyriopagopus lividus), black with white stripes (Aphonopelma seemanni), yellow leg markings (Eupalaestrus campestratus), metallic blue legs with vibrant orange abdomen and green prosoma (Chromatopelma cyaneopubescens). Their natural habitats include savanna, grasslands such as the pampas, rainforests, deserts, scrubland, mountains, and cloud forests. They are generally classed among the terrestrial types. They are burrowers {{that live in the}} ground.|$|R
50|$|Central America {{already has}} several {{supranational}} {{institutions such as}} the <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> Parliament, the <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> Bank for Economic Integration and the <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> Common Market.|$|R
2500|$|All {{the species}} of Brachypelma {{that have been}} studied in detail live in burrows. These have a single entrance, a little larger than the spider, opening into a {{horizontal}} tunnel that usually leads to two chambers: one where it molts and one where it rests and consumes its prey. The entrance is blocked with material, such as soil and leaves, bound together by silk when the spider is inactive for significant length of time; otherwise the entrance is open with some silk visible. North <b>American</b> <b>tarantulas</b> like Brachypelma are [...] "sit and wait" [...] predators, seizing prey passing by the burrow entrance.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to mambalgins, {{at least three}} other peptides from three different taxa have been identified as interacting with ASICs: PcTx1, from the South <b>American</b> <b>tarantula</b> Psalmopoeus cambridgei; APETx2, from the sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima; and MitTx, a heterodimer from the snake Micrurus tener tener. PcTx1 and APETx2, like mambalgins, are ASIC inhibitors, albeit with different subtype specificities; MitTx is an activator associated with causing pain in vivo. The four proteins have no detectable sequence similarity. The natural function of ASIC-inhibiting analgesic peptides is unclear, as all are produced by predator animals yet have no known toxic effects on the corresponding prey.|$|R
50|$|The most {{effective}} and best-known inhibitor of ASICs is PcTX1. PcTX1 specifically inhibits ASICa and has an IC50 value in the nanomolar range- a smaller IC50 than all other known ASIC inhibitors which {{have been in the}} micromolar range. In addition, PcTX1 does not inhibit other voltage-gated ion channels or ligand-gated channels. The structure of this inhibitor is 40 amino acids linked with disulfide bonds. It was identified as a peptide toxin from the South <b>American</b> <b>tarantula</b> Psalmopoeus Cambridge. When PcTX1 was administered within the basolateral amygdala of rats, the emotion and anxiety related symptoms associated with pain were significantly decreased.|$|R

The <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> Free Trade Agreement was signed by five <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> countries, the Dominican Republic, and the United States.
