The Unites States government in particular has threatened to invoke trade legislation to retaliate against countries that fail to attack domestic piracy activities. This paper briefly reviews the economic consequences of international product counterfeiting. It cautions that while such piracy has net costs, widespread retaliation through trade protectionism could also prove costly. It recommends a policy approach that facilitates “private” protection of property rights. © 1988 JIBS. Journal of International Business Studies (1988) 19, 497 – 504...|$|E
40|$|According to FDA {{estimates}} about 10 % of all drugs sold worldwide are counterfeit. Annual {{global trade}} in counterfeit goods {{is estimated to}} be $ 600 billion and growing. Counterfeit goods and drugs leads real threat to consumer safety as well as to loss of companies brand value and profits. Till date, dosage authentication required forensic analysis in a laboratory which is a slow process involving application of sophisticated equipment. Now days to avoid <b>counterfeiting</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> many companies are coming with various techniques of product authentication. One of the newest, innovative securities ways is by applying micro-tags to the dosage. Unlike forensic systems, micro tags can provide quick, reliable, economical identification and authentication of a drug product in the field within a few minutes, without destroying the product. Not only this much, end-users also can monitor the tags with a simple, inexpensive, hand-held detection system. Each tag is unique to the drug and cannot be reverse-engineered by a counterfeiter. Micro-tag provides safe, easily implementable, reliable means of authentication of product...|$|E

Thus, protection against counterfeiting {{becomes more and more}} important. One possibility to ensure protection against forgery is to label the original products with special markers. In our study, we investigate and develop new, effective procedures to generate and use diatom shells as such security particles. The following characteristics offer considerable advantages: •	Diatoms have very characteristic 3 D-shell structures •	The silica shells are very stable against high temperatures and acids •	They show an enormous richness in species diversity •	Significant modifications of the shell structure can be carried out •	They can be combined with other security particles The aim of our study is 1) to select, sample and cultivate appropriate species, 2) to modify their shells in an efficient, highly specific way, 3) to gain new insights in morphogenesis and its regulation and 4) to develop ideal solutions to apply and verify specific diatoms on selected products. ...|$|E

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Apparel, Textiles, and Interior DesignJoy KozarChina is the world’s largest apparel producer, exporter, and {{maintains}} the largest domestic apparel market. Since economic {{reform in the}} 1980 s that opened up the Chinese market for foreign investors, China’s domestic apparel market has attracted many foreign (Western) apparel brands (Shenkar, 2005). More than 10, 000 different international apparel brands share China’s domestic apparel market, including brands from France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States, Britain, and South Korea, among others. Around 2, 000 Chinese domestic apparel brands have experienced difficultly surviving in China’s domestic apparel market. Besides {{the large number of}} foreign (Western) apparel brands, counterfeit apparel products have grown faster than China’s government can control. As a result, China has become the world’s largest counterfeit market. This has become a secondary threat to China’s domestic apparel market and national economy. Additionally, because of economic growth and modernization in China, Chinese consumers have accepted more Westernized values, but also retained their traditional face-saving values. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} is to explore how their attitudes toward counterfeit apparel products, China’s domestic apparel brands, and foreign (Western) apparel brands are influenced by their level of perception about knowledge and attitudes toward counterfeit apparel products, face-saving values, materialistic values, and ethical values. This study utilized a sample of males and females between the ages of 18 and 64, who reside in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Chengdu, and Wuhan, China. A questionnaire was utilized as part of this study and data was collected online by SOJUMP Survey Company. A total of 1, 192 participants (736 males and 456 females) participated in this study. There are in total nine significant relationships that have been found in this study. First, the researcher found a positive relationship between Chinese consumers’ perception about knowledge <b>of</b> <b>counterfeit</b> apparel <b>products</b> and their attitudes about counterfeit apparel products. Second and third, the present study also discovered that Chinese consumers with favorable attitudes of foreign apparel brands or negative attitude of China’s domestic apparel brands would similarly hold positive attitudes <b>of</b> <b>counterfeit</b> apparel <b>products.</b> Fourth, the present scholar concluded that Chinese consumers with favorable attitudes of China’s domestic apparel brands tend to hold negative attitudes <b>of</b> <b>counterfeit</b> apparel <b>products.</b> Fifth and sixth, it was found that Chinese consumers with high level of face-saving values show positive attitudes of foreign (Western) apparel brands and counterfeit apparel products. Seventh, Chinese consumers with high level of face-saving values also possess strong materialistic values. Consequently Chinese consumers with strong materialistic values tend to hold positive attitudes <b>of</b> <b>counterfeit</b> apparel <b>products</b> and foreign (Western) apparel products, but negative attitudes of China’s domestic apparel brands. The findings of this study show that Chinese consumers have a very low level of perception about knowledge <b>of</b> <b>counterfeit</b> apparel <b>products.</b> It is necessary to connect educators, government, apparel industry, and brand owners to develop and enhance anti-counterfeit educational programs. These programs should clearly explain the perception about knowledge of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), trademark, and the negative causes <b>of</b> <b>counterfeit</b> <b>products</b> are warranted. Also, it is better for China’s domestic apparel brand companies to develop better brand images and improve product quality to meet Chinese consumers’ face-saving standards and materialistic values...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{examined}} the effects of image congruence and self-monitoring on <b>product</b> evaluations <b>of</b> <b>counterfeit</b> <b>products.</b> Study results show that image congruence is positively related to both product attitude and purchase intentions. Specifically, they found that ideal self-image congruence is more relevant to genuine products, while actual self-image congruence is more relevant to counterfeit products. The study provides further evidence that high self-monitored consumers would have better product evaluations on a genuine product compared to the low self-monitored consumers. In contrast, low self-monitored consumers would have higher product evaluations on counterfeits compared to high self-monitored consumers. The evaluation of image congruence–product relationship is also found to be positively moderated through self-monitoring in the context <b>of</b> genuine <b>products.</b> The major theoretical contribution of this study is an extension of the image congruence hypothesis to the context <b>of</b> <b>counterfeit</b> <b>products</b> and the acknowledgment of the role of self-monitoring in consumer behavior.
