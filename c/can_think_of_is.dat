2500|$|After {{the tour}} of South Africa, Wilkinson's 1939 season was disappointing. A hand injury {{prevented}} him from playing {{early on in the}} season. He finished the year with 63wickets at an average of 30.85, although he did manage career best figures of 8/53 against Hampshire in May 1939. Talking about why he thought he hadn't matched his success from the previous year, Wilkinson said [...] "I don't know why but nothing really went right. The only thing I <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>is</b> that I tried to be too perfect, particularly with the googly. I had an England cap and as an England player I had to be good".|$|E

He was {{completely}} shocked by the situation he had just photographed. He said to Silva [...] "I see all this, and all I <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>is</b> Megan". Megan was his young daughter. He lit a cigarette and became more and more emotional by the minute. [...] "I can't wait to hug her when I get home."

2500|$|In their {{penultimate}} {{debate on}} August 28 of that year, the two disagreed over {{the actions of}} the Chicago Police Department and the protesters at the ongoing convention. In reference to the response of the police involved in supposedly taking down a Viet Cong flag, moderator Howard K. Smith asked whether raising a Nazi flag during the Second World War would have elicited a similar response. Vidal responded that people were free to state their political views as they saw fit, whereupon Buckley interrupted and noted that people were free to speak their views but others were also free to ostracize them for holding those views, noting that in the U.S. during the Second World War [...] "some people were pro-Nazi and they were well treated by those who ostracized them—and I'm for ostracizing people who egg on other people to shoot American Marines and American soldiers. I know you [...] don't care because you have no sense of identification with—". Vidal then interjected that [...] "the only sort of pro- or crypto-Nazi I <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>is</b> yourself," [...] whereupon Smith interjected, [...] "Now let's not call names." [...] Buckley, visibly angered, rose several inches from his seat and replied, [...] "Now listen, you queer, stop calling me a crypto-Nazi or I'll sock you in your goddamn face, and you'll stay plastered." [...] Buckley later apologized in print for having called Vidal a [...] "queer" [...] in a burst of anger rather than in a clinical context, but also reiterated his distaste for Vidal as an [...] "evangelist for bisexuality": [...] "The man who in his essays proclaims the normalcy of his affliction, and in his art the desirability of it, is {{not to be confused with}} the man who bears his sorrow quietly. The addict is to be pitied and even respected, not the pusher." [...] The debates are chronicled in the 2015 documentary Best of Enemies.|$|E

5000|$|An Béal Bocht (The Poor Mouth) is a 1941 {{novel in}} Irish by Brian O'Nolan (Flann O'Brien), {{published}} under the pseudonym [...] "Myles na gCopaleen". It {{is widely regarded}} as one of the greatest Irish-language novels of the 20th century. An English translation by Patrick C. Power appeared in 1973. Stan Gebler Davies wrote: [...] "The Poor Mouth is wildly funny, but there is at the same time always a sense of black evil.

Wargrave, however, is still downstairs. The others find him seated, immobile and crudely dressed up in the attire of a judge. Wargrave is examined briefly by Dr Armstrong and pronounced dead from a gunshot to the forehead.|$|R

40|$|Borcherds algebras {{represent}} {{a new class}} of Lie algebras which have almost all the properties that ordinary Kac-Moody algebras have, and the only major difference is that these generalized Kac-Moody algebras are allowed to have imaginary simple roots.

We study the fundamental representation of this class of examples and prove that an irreducible module is given by the full tensor algebra over some integrable highest weight module of the underlying Kac-Moody algebra. We also comment on possible realizations of these Lie algebras in physics as symmetry algebras in quantum field theory. Comment: 8 page...|$|R

The only possible explanation of his indifference that I <b>can</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>is</b> that he must have made some low marriage in London, and does not care about introducing his wife to the county; it is just the sort of thing that a man with his irregular Bohemian habits might do--a pretty model, perhaps, or some peasant girl he has come across when out sketching." ...|$|E
