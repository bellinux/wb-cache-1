40|$|An {{innovative}} approach to condition-based maintenance of <b>coal</b> <b>grinding</b> subsystems at thermoelectric power plants is {{proposed in the}} paper. Coal mill grinding tables become worn over time {{and need to be}} replaced through time-based maintenance, after a certain number of service hours.

Considerable financial losses are incurred when the entire <b>coal</b> <b>grinding</b> subsystem is shut down and the grinding table found to not actually require replacement. The only way to determine whether replacement is necessary is to shut down and open the entire subsystem for visual inspection. The proposed algorithm supports condition-based maintenance and involves the application of T 2 control charts to distinct acoustic signal parameters in the frequency domain and the construction of Hidden Markov Models whose observations are coded samples from the control charts. In the present research, the acoustic signals were collected by coal mill monitoring at the thermoelectric power plant “Kostolac” in Serbia.

A {{statement}} of the project objectives {{is included in the}} Introduction of this report. Two additional biomass co-firing test burns were conducted during this quarter. In the first test (Test 10), up to 20 % by weight dry hardwood sawdust and switchgrass was compiled with Galatia coal and injected through the dual-register burner. Galatia coal is a medium-sulfur Illinois Basin coal ({approx} 1. 0 % S). The dual-register burner is a generic low-NO{sub x} burner that incorporates two independent wind boxes. In the second test (Test 11), regular ({approx} 70 % passing 200 mesh) and finely ground ({approx} 90 % passing 200 mesh) Pratt Seam coal was injected through the single-register burner to determine if <b>coal</b> <b>grind</b> affects NO{sub x} and unburned carbon emissions.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{number of}} coal fired {{industrial}} systems and utility power plants is rapidly increasing {{because of the}} high cost and uncertain availability of fuel oil and natural gas. For many cement producers in the United States, the conversion from fuel oil and natural gas to pulverized coal has been difficult, frustrating, and in a few cases, very costly. This study deals mainly with coal safety requirements in the cement industry which accounts for {{a very small percentage of}} coal usage in pulverized coal firing systems. It also deals with the safety requirements associated with <b>coal</b> <b>grinding,</b> drying, blending. transporting, and storing. Case histories investigated by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) will be discussed, and recommendations will be made for future fire and explosion prevention.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} the development of improved technology for the preparation of coal-water slurries that have potential for replacing fuel oil in direct combustion. This should be of major importance to the United States in its efforts to reduce dependence on imported oil and to rely more on its enormous low-cost coal resources. In accordance with this objective, in the first stage of this project, considerable work was conducted to standardize experimental procedures for sample preparation, <b>coal</b> <b>grinding,</b> and Theological measurements to assure reproducibility of the experimental results. Since a Haake RV- 12 viscometer with an MV-DIN sensor system was found to give the most reproducible results for measurement of slurry viscosities, it has subsequently been used for all of our Theological measurements. Methods were developed for applying the acoustophoresis technique for studying the electrokinetic behavior of concentrated coal-water suspensions. These measurements were carried out using this technique to identify the potential of chemical additives for functioning as reagents for effective dispersion. Detailed investigations of the effect of solids content and chemical additives on the rheology of coal-water slurries, prepared with fines produced by the ball milling of Pittsburgh No. 8 coal, were conducted during the first phase of our research program.

40|$|Grinding coals to a {{pulverised}} coal specification for {{blast furnace injection}} can be costly, which is why some iron manufacturers choose a larger granulated coal size specification. However, there is a concern that these coals may have lower burnout in the raceway region {{so there is a}} technical and economic balance with <b>coal</b> <b>grinding.</b> This paper investigates how the process of grinding alters the physical properties, plus the surface chemistry, of coals and their chars formed in a drop tube furnace; it was found that in many cases the larger particle size coals gave improved combustion burnout compared to smaller sizes. The physical properties of the chars, formed from grinding coals to different sizes, resulted in char swelling in the smaller particle sizes, compared to char fragmentation for the larger size classifications. Minerals phases associated with better coal reactivity were found to undergo higher conversion to other chemical forms with the larger size coals, suggesting a potential catalytic or synergistic contribution to their burnout. A closer look at the surface chemistry suggests that the action of grinding coals has an important effect on the surface chemistry. The XPS spectra of the chars, formed in a drop tube furnace, indicated that grinding the coals to a smaller particle size reduced the carbon–oxygen and carbon–mineral interactions compared to the larger sizes and correlated with the higher burnouts. An increasing trend was identified for the carbon sp 2 bonding with larger size and higher rank coals which correlated with their burnout at low carbon conversions; however, this did not hold at higher conversions, suggesting other factors were more dominant...|$|E

40|$|Currently in South Africa {{there is}} no {{acceptable}} standard method for testing coals for abrasion. Abrasion is the tendency of coals to wear away machinery. The technique referred to as YGP (Yancey, Geer and Price), proposed and accepted in 1951, is most commonly used to test for abrasion. Over the years {{there have been some}} modifications to this method by both mining houses and coal users (such as Eskom) which have resulted in inconsistent and conflicting results. To this end, this study serves {{as part of a larger}} project that will aim at devising a standard method acceptable for testing coals for abrasion in South Africa. The underlying principle behind this research was to determine the main characteristics in South African run of mine (ROM) coals that may cause abrasion. This research work specifically seeks to: (1) determine if the Abrasion Index (AI) and Hardgrove Grindability Index (HGI), empirical correlations, developed by Scieszka (1985), can be verified using experimental results; (2) determine if excluded minerals and included minerals are equally abrasive; (3) establish the type of abrasive wear that occurred during <b>coal</b> <b>grinding.</b> Five ROM coals from the Witbank Coalfields were analysed. An abrasion index tester pot and Hardgrove machine were used to determine the grinding properties of the coal samples. XRD (Rietveld method), XRF, Petrography and SEM-EDS were used to characterise the coals samples in terms of their inorganic and organic components. SEM-EDS was also used for the particle morphology analysis, and blade surface topography analysis. TGA, moisture oven and sieve method were used for proximate analysis, moisture analysis, and particle size distribution analysis respectively. The results indicated that the key characteristics that influenced the AI of the coal samples were moisture, vitrinite, and minerals and mineral associations (excluded and included minerals and carbominerite) and HGI. Results indicated that coal weathering renders coals less abrasive, compared to unweathered coals.

40|$|Blast furnace is {{the heart}} of every steel plant. Steel {{production}} is based on the blast furnace process, as it is where the iron is extracted from the iron ore and turned into liquid iron, which will subsequently be used to make liquid steel. Therefore, without hot iron, steel can not be produced. Blast furnaces in this process are supplied among others with pulverized coal. Raw coal should be prepared for the blast furnaces in the form of fine coal powder. This fine coal powder should then be injected into the blast furnaces in order to continue the production. This process is carried out by the Pulverized Coal Injection System, which changes raw coal into dry fine coal powder. The system consists of a hot gas generator, a coal mill, a bagfilter as well as various valves, fans and piping. The general idea is to burn specific gases with the help of equipments and to use them to dry the coal in the cycle. When the amount of the gases inserted into the system is changed, the dried coal amount is directly affected. Based on this background the following project is carried out, which aims at the investigation of bottlenecks and critical points in the process. The most important bottleneck is the limited possibility of fresh air usage, as the oxygen in fresh air can cause explosions if existent in exceeding amounts in the system and thus, is dangerous. In order to prevent this explosive condition in the system, additional gases need {{to be added to the}} system. The aim of this project is to introduce additional gases to the system in order to increase the upper limit of the fresh air amount. Increasing the amount of fresh air in the recirculation gas should provide more amount of dried coal,hence increasing the drying capacity of the <b>coal</b> <b>grinding</b> plant. To understand the situation better, tests about gas injection are carried out in the system. The results of the tests are analyzed and the performance changes in the system are calculated. For this, programs in Excel and also inLabVIEW are created to interpret the situations easily. As it is understood from the results of the tests, when the amount of the additional gases isincreased, approximately 10 % increase in the amount of dried coal is observed. Subsequently, Pulverized Coal Injection mill productivity isincreased. Additionally, oxygen percentage in the mill circuit will decrease and this is important for the safety conditions. To conclude, this project aims to show the usage and recycling of additional gases in “PulverizedCoal Injection” process by implying various programs and interpretations...|$|E
