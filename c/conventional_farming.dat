Spore communities of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and glomalin, a glycoprotein produced by AMF, were analyzed. Spores of Glomus clarum, G. etunicatum, G. mosseae, G. sp., Acaulospora longula, A. spinosa, Gigaspora margarita, and Paraglomus occultum were identified at the study sites, based on morphological and molecular characteristics.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{compares the}} {{production}} technology and production risk of organic and <b>conventional</b> arable <b>farms</b> in the Netherlands. Just–Pope production functions that explicitly account for output variability are estimated using panel data of Dutch organic and <b>conventional</b> <b>farms.</b> Prior {{investigation of the}} data indicates that within variation of output is significantly higher for organic farms, indicating that organic farms face more output variation than <b>conventional</b> <b>farms.</b> The estimation results indicate that in both types of farms, unobserved farm-specific factors like management skills and soil quality are important in explaining output variability and production risk. The results further indicate that land has the highest elasticity of production for both farm types. Labour and other variable inputs have significant production elasticities {{in the case of}} <b>conventional</b> <b>farms</b> and other variable inputs in the case of organic farms. Manure and fertilisers are risk-increasing inputs on organic farms and risk-reducing inputs on <b>conventional</b> <b>farms.</b> Other variable inputs and labour are risk increasing on both farm types; capital and land are risk-reducing inputs.

25|$|In {{the event}} of a {{petroleum}} shortage (see peak oil for global concerns), organic agriculture can be more attractive than conventional practices that use petroleum-based pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers. Some studies using modern organic-farming methods have reported yields equal to or higher than those available from <b>conventional</b> <b>farming.</b> In the aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union, with shortages of conventional petroleum-based inputs, Cuba made use of mostly organic practices, including biopesticides, plant-based pesticides and sustainable cropping practices, to feed its populace. However, organic farming may be more labor-intensive and would require a shift of the workforce from urban to rural areas. The reconditioning of soil to restore organic matter lost during the use of monoculture agriculture techniques is important to provide a reservoir of plant-available nutrients, to maintain texture, and to minimize erosion.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a rapid rise in the {{emergence}} of multi-drug-resistant pathogens in the past 10 to 15 yr and some bacteria are now resistant to most antimicrobial agents. Antibiotic use is very restricted on Swiss organic dairy farms, and a purely prophylactic use, such as for dry cow mastitis prevention, is forbidden. A low prevalence of antibiotic resistance in organic farms can be expected compared with <b>conventional</b> <b>farms</b> because the bacteria are infrequently or not exposed to antibiotics. The occurrence of antibiotic resistance was compared between mastitis pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, nonaureus staphylococci, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis) from farms with organic and conventional dairy production. Clear differences in the percentage of antibiotic resistance were mainly species-related, but did not differ significantly between isolates from cows kept on organic and <b>conventional</b> <b>farms,</b> except for Streptococcus uberis, which exhibited significantly more single resistances (compared with no resistance) when isolated from cows kept on organic farms (6 / 10 isolates) than on <b>conventional</b> <b>farms</b> (0 / 5 isolates).
