5|$|A study {{conducted}} at the Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS), at the University of California, Davis (UC Davis) published in 2014 found that many <b>car</b> <b>dealers</b> are less than enthusiastic about plug-in vehicles. ITS conducted 43 interviews with six automakers and 20 new <b>car</b> <b>dealers</b> selling plug-in vehicles in California’s major metro markets. The study also analyzed national and state-level J.D. Power 2013 Sales Satisfaction Index (SSI) study data on customer satisfaction with new car dealerships and Tesla retail stores. The researchers found that buyers of plug-in electric vehicles were significantly less satisfied and rated the dealer purchase experience much lower than buyers of non-premium conventional cars, while Tesla Motors earned industry-high scores. According to the findings, plug-in buyers expect more from dealers than conventional buyers, including product knowledge and support that extends beyond traditional offerings.|$|E
5|$|On March 2009 the Colombian {{government}} {{enacted a}} mandate to introduce E85 flexible-fuel cars. The executive decree applies to all gasoline-powered vehicles with engines smaller than 2.0 liters manufactured, imported, and commercialized in the country beginning in 2012, mandating that 60% of such vehicles must have flex-fuel engines capable of running with gasoline or E85, or any blend of both. By 2014 the mandatory quota is 80% and it will reach 100 percent by 2016. All vehicles with engines bigger than 2.0 liters must be E85 capable starting in 2013. The decree also mandates that by 2011 all gasoline stations must provide infrastructure to guarantee availability of E85 throughout the country. The mandatory introduction of E85 flex-fuels has caused controversy among carmakers, <b>car</b> <b>dealers,</b> gasoline station owners, and even some ethanol producers complained the industry {{is not ready to}} supply enough ethanol for the new E85 fleet.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} reasons for the {{reluctance}} of some dealers to sell plug-in electric vehicles. PEVs do not offer <b>car</b> <b>dealers</b> the same profits as gasoline-powered car. Plug-in electric vehicles take more time to sell because of the explaining required, which hurts overall sales and sales people commissions. Electric vehicles also may require less maintenance, resulting in loss of service revenue, and thus undermining the biggest source of dealer profits, their service departments. According to the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADS), dealers on average make {{three times as much}} profit from service as they do from new car sales. However, a NADS spokesman said there was not sufficient data to prove that electric cars would require less maintenance. According to the New York Times, BMW and Nissan are among the companies whose dealers tend to be more enthusiastic and informed, but only about 10% of dealers are knowledgeable on the new technology.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} recover its losses, Royscot sued the <b>car</b> <b>dealer,</b> Maidenhead Honda Centre Ltd, {{alleging that the}} company's {{reliance}} upon the garage's innocent misrepresentation (fraud was not mentioned) induced it {{to enter into the}} hire purchase contract. It argued that, had the <b>car</b> <b>dealer</b> not given the wrong figures, it would never have entered the credit agreement, and therefore the subsequent loss was the <b>car</b> <b>dealer's</b> fault. The <b>car</b> <b>dealer</b> countered that the real cause of Royscot's loss was Mr Rogerson's dishonest sale of the car, because if he had not sold it, they would be entitled to repossession and discharge of their debt that way. The <b>car</b> <b>dealer</b> argued that Mr Rogerson's independent wrongful act broke the chain of causation between its misrepresentation and Royscot's loss.|$|R

25|$|In the Westward and TSW days, it {{was fairly}} common to see Cornish {{businesses}} advertise on commercial television, both of the 35mm slide voice-over advertisement type, and of full video or filmed productions lasting 30 seconds or more.

25|$|After {{the closure}} of the main works, part of the {{workshop}} was used for the building of Isetta microcars between 1957 and 1964 and some of the land remained in railway use, associated with the stabling of electric multiple unit trains and other maintenance functions. Much of the land later became a large open car park, and was used for a popular market every Sunday morning. Some land on the eastern side was given over to an assortment of retail units including a number of <b>car</b> <b>dealers</b> with temporary structures being the predominant building type, and a strip below the yard was used for retail premises; behind these remained the stone and brick columns over which the yard had been extended when space was at a premium. Much of the land which was not suitable for use either by lock-up traders or for car parking or still in use by British Rail was left derelict. The final traces of the locomotive works vanished with the demolition of the elevated 1930s Southern Railway signal box in the mid-1980s, the signal box having used part of the main locomotive erecting-shop wall as support.|$|E

[...] Political columnist David S. Broder has viewed Biden as having grown since he came to Washington and since his failed 1988 presidential bid: [...] "He responds to real people—that's been consistent throughout. And his ability to understand himself and deal with other politicians has gotten much much better." [...] Traub concludes that [...] "Biden is the kind of fundamentally happy person who can be as generous toward others as he is to himself." ...|$|E
