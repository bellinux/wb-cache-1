The remaining two pillars (jamarah) are not stoned on this day. These pillars are said to represent Satan. Pilgrims climb ramps to the multi-levelled Jamaraat Bridge, from which they can throw their pebbles at the jamarat. Because of safety reasons, in 2004 the pillars were replaced by long walls, with <b>catch</b> <b>basins</b> below to collect the pebbles.|$|E
25|$|When {{planning}} {{these new}} facilities, Metcalf {{was concerned about}} the security of the collection – damage to manuscripts and books from variations in heat and humidity, or worst of all, damage from a flood. In the case of Houghton, the building that was to house the rare collections at Harvard, many features were designed into the air conditioning and plumbing systems that were meant to mitigate the risk of damage. <b>Catch</b> <b>basins</b> were installed under any pipe running horizontally to catch and divert any water from leaks. The plumbing system itself was designed so that the location of leaks could be found quickly through a series of shut-off valves, and the walls were designed with easy access to plumbing. The display cases themselves were designed so that they were well ventilated. This allowed lighting to be installed in the cases (rather than outside) without impacting the temperature and humidity levels. It was features like these that helped keep the collections safe.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "infinite" [...] edge of {{the pool}} terminates at a weir that is 1/16 to 1/4 in lower than the {{required}} pool water level. A trough or <b>catch</b> <b>basin</b> is constructed below the weir. The water spills into the <b>catch</b> <b>basin,</b> from where it is pumped back into the pool.|$|R
50|$|Process: The {{evaporation}} surface (1) suctions {{water out}} of the capillary basin (6), puts the capillary pump (8) for the flooding process in action and quickly fills the surface from top to bottom. Then it drips into the <b>catch</b> <b>basin</b> (2). The water evaporates and sets the air circulation into motion. The drained water closes the hose (3) below. Here, air which flows via pipe into the water tank (5) is interrupted. The water in the tank can no longer flow out because under-pressure occurs. The residual water in the capillary basin (6), on the upper part, is evaporated by the evaporation surface (1). The residual water in the <b>catch</b> <b>basin</b> (2), on the bottom, is suctioned out by the lime separator (7) and evaporated. As soon as the <b>catch</b> <b>basin</b> is empty, air then flows again through the hose (3); water from the tank flows back to the capillary basins (6) and thereby begins the process again. The alternating filling levels for the <b>catch</b> and capillary <b>basins</b> suppress the creation of germs.|$|R
40|$|During {{the period}} 2006 - 2008, the ESTRUS Project (Enhanced and Sustainable TReatment for Urban Storm water) within the LIFE Environment Programme aimed at demonstrating the {{suitability}} and cost-effectiveness of <b>catch</b> <b>basin</b> treatment solutions for storm water runoff in harbour areas and production sites. The project {{consisted of a}} preliminary laboratory study (not described in this paper), and a following field implementation study. For the latter, a monitoring campaign was carried out at four pilot sites in {{the territory of the}} Province of Genoa (two port terminal sites and two production sites). Quali-quantity data were collected at the outlet section of the investigated storm water drainage networks, with and without treatment systems installed directly into the <b>catch</b> <b>basin</b> inlets, in order to assess the field performance of the <b>catch</b> <b>basin</b> treatment devices. This document focuses in particular on the treatment efficiency of suspended solids, hydrocarbons and heavy metals, which represent the main pollutant constituents associated with storm water runoff at the investigated experimental sites...|$|R

5000|$|Explanation:Water {{runs from}} the top over the surface (1), and the {{hydropneumatic}} controller takes {{over control of the}} water flow. The water, which runs over the surface, is collected in a <b>catch</b> <b>basin</b> (2). In order to make running fresh water out from a closed tank (5), it requires air. The water pressure suctions the air from the <b>catch</b> <b>basin</b> via a hose (3). Here the dripping water can close the hose and thereby, through under-pressure in the water tank (5), stops running out of the water tank. The filling process is stopped immediately and is restarted in relation to the humidity of the air. Contamination is once more suppressed, because dripped water immediately evaporates in the lime separator and, if necessary, in the humidity poster.Humidification posters: ...|$|R

40|$|In a May 1995 {{inspection}} of the WIPP-site Exhaust Shaft indicated that water was seeping through the shaft's concrete liner at depths of 50 to 85 feet below ground surface. In March 1996 a <b>catch</b> <b>basin</b> was installed {{at the base of}} the Exhaust Shaft to intercept and prevent fluid from entering the repository horizon. Analyses of fluid samples collected from the <b>catch</b> <b>basin</b> indicated that some samples had concentration levels that exceeded U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) toxicity characteristics for lead under Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) {section} 261. 24. Ventilation system operations, weather conditions, and seepage into the Exhaust Shaft have resulted in operational problems. First, increased moisture in the shaft has affected air filters on sampling probes located near the top of the Exhaust Shaft, thus preventing analysis of air samples. Second, production of fluid in the shaft reporting to the <b>catch</b> <b>basin</b> created a disposal problem of the fluid which has been classified as a hazardous material under 40 CFR {section} 261. 24 for lead. Though these problems do not effect the stability of the shaft they are a nuisance in that they increase operational costs and impact operation of the Exhaust Shaft air-monitoring system...|$|R
50|$|Curb {{extensions}} complicate drainage. They obstruct the gutter, so a <b>catch</b> <b>basin</b> {{is needed}} at the uphill end {{to keep a}} puddle from forming.

50|$|Many storm {{drainage}} systems {{are designed to}} drain the storm water, untreated, into rivers or streams. Many local governments conduct public awareness campaigns about this, lest waste be dumped into the storm drain system.

Trout Unlimited Canada recommends that a yellow fish symbol be painted next to existing storm drains.|$|E
50|$|At 2:30 p.m. on the {{afternoon}} of Friday, October 20, 1944, above ground storage tank number 4, holding liquefied natural gas in the East Ohio Gas Company's tank farm, began to emit a vapor that poured from a seam {{on the side of the}} tank. The tank was located near Lake Erie on East 61st Street, and winds from the lake pushed the vapor into a mixed use section of Cleveland, where it dropped into the sewer lines via the <b>catch</b> <b>basins</b> located in the street gutters.|$|E
50|$|Basins can {{be filled}} with {{concrete}} up to the pipe level to prevent this reservoir from forming. Without proper maintenance, the functionality of the basin is questionable, as these <b>catch</b> <b>basins</b> are most commonly not cleaned annually as is needed to make them perform as designed. The trapping of debris serves no purpose because once filled they operate as if no basins were present, but continue to allow a shallow area of water retention for the breeding of mosquito. Moreover, even if cleaned and maintained, the water reservoir remains filled, accommodating the breeding of mosquitoes.|$|E
25|$|In addition, to {{its legal}} {{activities}} Soundkeeper Inc., under Backer's leadership, restored salt marshes in the Bronx, New York. and has pioneered {{the use of}} <b>catch</b> <b>basin</b> filters to clean polluted storm water of bacteria, metals, and hydrocarbons before it enters Long Island Sound, as well as numerous other projects.|$|R

50|$|<b>Catch</b> <b>basins</b> are {{commonly}} designed with a sump area below the outlet pipe level {{which is a}} reservoir for water and debris to help prevent the pipe from clogging. Unless they are constructed with permeable bottoms to allow water to infiltrate into the underlying soil, this subterranean basin can become a perfect mosquito breeding area because it is cool, dark, and retains stagnant water {{for long periods of}} time. Combined with standard grates which have holes large enough for mosquitoes to enter and leave the basin, this is a major problem in mosquito control.|$|E
