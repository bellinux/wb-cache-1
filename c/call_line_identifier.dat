50|$|In {{the end of}} 1944 the City of Helsinki had {{acquired}} the entirety of HRO, which now became a municipal transport authority under the name Helsingin Kaupungin Liikennelaitos (HKL). This had little to no effect in tram operations. In 1950 secondary <b>line</b> <b>identifier</b> letters were taken into use to distinguish rush hour services from the standard routes (for example 1A, KA. The second letter was a capital letter but in a smaller size from the first). In 1953 the usage of letters as the primary <b>line</b> <b>identifier</b> ended, and the following year line colours were also abandoned.Trams remained the main public transport system until the 1950s and 1960s, when the city rapidly sprawled and private cars became increasingly common; the new suburbs came to be served mainly by buses and commuter trains. During the 1940s and 1950s plans were drawn for a large light rail network incorporating into the tram system, which would have served major suburban centers; in preparation for this the new Kulosaari bridge (built 1956) featured a reserved space for tram tracks, while the new tram depot was built in Koskela next to a planned northeast light rail line - new tracks had to be built linking the depot to the existing network. As of August 2008, this track along Kustaa Vaasan tie has never been used in normal passenger traffic. During the 1950s a total of 105 Finnish-built double-bogie trams (Karia types HM IV and HM V, Valmet types RM 1 and RM 3) were delivered to the HKL.|$|R

40|$|Automotive traffic {{monitoring}} using probe vehicles with Global Positioning System receivers promises {{significant improvements in}} cost, coverage, and accuracy. Current approaches, however, raise privacy concerns because they require participants to reveal their positions to an external {{traffic monitoring}} server. To address this challenge, we propose a system based on virtual trip lines and an associated cloaking technique. Virtual trip lines are geographic markers that indicate where vehicles should provide location up-dates. These markers can be placed to avoid particularly privacy sensitive locations. They also allow aggregating and cloaking sev-eral location updates based on trip <b>line</b> <b>identifiers,</b> without knowing the actual geographic locations of these trip lines. Thus they facil-itate {{the design of a}} distributed architecture, where no single entity has a complete knowledge of probe identities and fine-grained lo...|$|R

50|$|In 1897 HRO {{received}} {{the right to}} construct an electrified tramway into Helsinki. A call for bids was sent out the following year, and the contract was awarded to the Germany-based O.L. Kummer. By terms on the agreement Kummer had to construct and electrify the new tram system as well as construct the trams used on it, and the company {{would be responsible for}} trafficking the new system for up to three years in order to ensure good quality of construction. Electrification of the network was mostly completed in 1900, with one short horse-drawn line lingering until 1901. Kummer had made notable profits from operating the new electrified system, and already in 1901 HRO assumed responsibility for operating the tram network. Following the electrification the number of lines grew into four, but all lines remained single-track. At the same time colours were taken into use as <b>line</b> <b>identifiers.</b>|$|R
