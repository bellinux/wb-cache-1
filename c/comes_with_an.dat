25|$|Because the PSP Go {{does not}} feature a UMD drive, games are {{downloaded}} from the PlayStation Store. While other PSP models {{have included the}} ability to run games and demos downloaded from the PlayStation Store, the PSP Go is the first for which {{this is the only}} means of distribution. The PSP Go has the demo version of Patapon 2 loaded onto the system and it also <b>comes</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ESRB ratings guide, both preloaded into the internal memory in the games section. The removal of the UMD drive effectively region locks the unit due {{to the way in which}} a PSP must be linked to a single PlayStation Network account. Since each account is locked to a single region, this prevents the user from ever playing games from more than one region at a time (since games from accounts other than the currently linked account cannot be started). There are three ways to access the PlayStation Store. The PSP Go can directly download to itself, or users can also download then transfer the games from a PlayStation 3 or the Media Go software on Windows based computers. All current downloadable PSP and PlayStation games available for older PSP models are compatible with the PSP Go. Sony has also confirmed that almost all UMD based PSP games released after October 1, 2009 will be available for download, and a majority of older UMD-only games will also be downloadable at that time.|$|E

While the general profile of original P210 design was followed for the new gun, SIG Sauer this time around chose to use a button-style, frame magazine catch, an elongated 'beavertail' shaped {{similar to those found}} on 1911 and SIG Sauer Elite pistols, more extensive use of stainless steel, as well update of other features and specifications. Two versions were originally offered at launch: a fixed sight base model and the Target version that <b>comes</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> adjustable rear sight. A limited run collector's variant of the basic model was also offered at launch; referred to as the First Edition, this version consisted of a sequentially numbered run to a total number of 210 examples featuring ornate engraving and metal inlay. In 2012, SIG Sauer {{introduced a}} new variant of P210 Legend, called the Super Target, which featured additional modifications such as an extended barrel length to 6 inches, control reconfiguration to a 1911-style thumb safety and wood grips with integral magwell funneling. In 2013 SIG Sauer introduced the Silver series of the P210 Legend, which consists of the existing Legend models finished in silver colored PVD instead of the standard proprietary Nitron finish that is commonly used on SIG Sauer handguns.|$|E
