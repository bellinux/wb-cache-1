The transfer is accomplished by means of an agreement of transfer or oordrags-ooreenkoms between the <b>cedent</b> and the cessionary arising out of a justa causa from which the former's intention to transfer the right (animus transferendi) and the latter's intention to become the holder of the right (animus acquirendi) appears or can be inferred.

It examines the implications of profound change arising from shifts in regulation, consolidation in the key players, and increasing competition both within the reinsurance industry and from alternative capital providers. These changes are driving convergence in a market that was, until recently, characterised by significant cultural variation in buying and selling reinsurance. The findings in this report will help industry participants to take stock of their current position in the industry, the specific types of differentiation available, and how these differentiators can create advantage. Specifically, the report provides evidence-based frameworks and models that firms can use to diagnose their existing strategies and structures and consider alternatives...|$|R
50|$|Under {{the civil}} law system, cession is the {{equivalent}} of assignment, and therefore, is an act by which a personal claim is transferred from the assignor (the <b>cedent)</b> to the assignee (the cessionary). Whereas real rights are transferred by delivery, personal rights are transferred by cession. Once the obligation of the debtor is transferred, the cessionary is entirely substituted. The original creditor (<b>cedent)</b> loses his right to claim and the new creditor (cessionary) gains that right.|$|E

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this thesis is to {{determine}} the methodologies of composing the optimal risk transfer mechanism from the direct insurer's point of view. The study aims to investigate reinsurance optimization approaches developed by the actuarial science with an emphasis on the derivation of mathematical formulation of the retention level, being a prior parameter of the reinsurance agreement. The application of derived techniques to quota share and excess of loss reinsurance treaties is discussed. Since it is usually admitted that reinsurance should ensure <b>cedent’s</b> financial stability, the simulation model is composed to link the direct insurer’s risk process and reinsurance parameter in order to analyze the effects of examined optimization methodologies on the insurer’s general financial performance. Consequently, the conclusions based on obtained simulation results are provided...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Association {{rules have}} {{exhibited}} an excellent {{ability to identify}} interesting association relationships among a set of binary variables describing huge amount of transactions. Although the rules can be relatively easily generalized to other variable types, the generalization {{can result in a}} computationally expensive algorithm generating a prohibitive number of redundant rules of little significance. This danger especially applies to quantitative and ordinal variables. This paper presents and verifies an alternative approach to the quantitative and ordinal association rule mining. In this approach, quantitative or ordinal variables are not immediately transformed into a set of binary variables. Instead, it applies simple arithmetic operations in order to construct the <b>cedents</b> and searches for areas of increased association which are finally decomposed into conjunctions of literals. This scenario outputs rules that do not syntactically differentiate from classical association rules...|$|R

Assuming that market premiums are set according to the expected value principle with varying loading factors, the optimal reinsurance parameters of this contract are obtained under three alternative single and joint party reinsurance criteria: (i) strong minimum of the total retained loss VaR measure; (ii) weak minimum of the total retained loss VaR measure and maximum of the reinsurer's expected profit; (iii) weak minimum of the total retained loss VaR measure and minimum {{of the total variance}} risk measure.

40|$|As a core {{activity}} and discipline of corporate management and corporate governance, risk management is, especially nowadays, {{a central part}} in pursuing the sustainable development desiderates, both {{from the perspective of}} the firm and of the society as a whole. Considering the negative impact natural catastrophes have on the companies’ and countries’ competitiveness, the development of sustainable financial products that make a contribution to transferring the risk and allocating the capital in case of disasters stands for a continual preoccupation, especially for the (re) insurance industry, while the study of catastrophe bonds – insurance-linked securities – is of interest in the specialized literature. In this context, the scope of the present research is to expand the empirical studies within this field while examining the link between the structure of the catastrophe bonds and the risk management approach employed while accessing the capital markets through this transactions. The methodology entailed clustering a selection of transactions developed by European <b>cedents</b> based on the size of each issue and correlating the results with an innovative score, developed to encompass several important catastrophe bonds structural components. The findings reflect that the general structural elements of the financial transactions reflect closely the corporate approach regarding the innovative risk intermediation instruments for the examined catastrophe bonds deals. The outcomes also emphasize, as expected, that companies with a stronger presence on this market seem to have a more sophisticated risk management approach...|$|R

5000|$|The {{doctrine}} of uberrimae fides - {{utmost good faith}} - {{is present in the}} insurance law of all common law systems. An insurance contract is a contract of utmost good faith. The most important expression of that principle, under the doctrine as it has been interpreted in England, is that the prospective insured must accurately disclose to the insurer everything that he knows and that is or would be material to the reasonable insurer. Something is material if it would influence a prudent insurer in determining whether to write a risk, and if so upon what terms. If the insurer is not told everything material about the risk, or if a material misrepresentation is made, the insurer may avoid (or [...] "rescind") the policy, i.e. the insurer may treat the policy as having been void from inception, returning the premium paid. Reinsurance contracts (between reinsurers and insurers/cedents) require the highest level of utmost good faith, and such utmost good faith is considered the foundation of reinsurance. In order to make reinsurance affordable, a reinsurer cannot duplicate costly insurer underwriting and claim handling costs, and must rely on an insurer’s absolute transparency and candor. In return, a reinsurer must appropriately investigate and reimburse an insurer’s good faith claim payments, following the fortunes of the <b>cedent.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{question}} of whether an authority conclude a juristic act on behalf of another can be granted irrevocably is a controversial one. It has been held, {{in a number of}} cases, that an authority is irrevocable, in the strict sense, where the agent is appointed procurator in rem suam: that is, where the agent is authorised to do an act for the agent’s own benefit, and not for the principal’s; or, as it is generally styled, the authority is “coupled with an interest” or “forms part of a security,” for example, where an agent is authorised to pass a bond in his own favour over the principal’s property. This proposition reflects Anglo-American rather than Roman-Dutch law, which consistently refused to recognise the validity of a procurator in rem suam mentioned by Voet. Such a procurator was, in Voet’s time, no more than a cessionary, and, of course, the <b>cedent</b> lacked the power to revoke the cession unilaterally. Whether the Supreme Court of Appeal will accept that an authority “coupled with an interest” is irrevocable remains to be seen. “The better view,” writes Graham Bradfield, “appears to be that an authority is always revocable, even if it is linked with a contract of mandate, which cannot be terminated unilaterally.” Of course, if the principal has contracted not to revoke the authority, but does so, the principal will be liable in damages for breach of contract.|$|E
