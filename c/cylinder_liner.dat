25|$|The {{most likely}} {{reason for the}} {{overheating}} of the port engine was the plate heat exchanger getting clogged by small pieces of coal that had washed overboard from the cargo hold and entered the cooling system via the port side sea chest. The starboard engine was not affected because it used a separate sea water intake {{in the bottom of}} the vessel. Another possible cause was the development of hairline cracks in the <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner</b> or head due to large variations in engine load, allowing hot exhaust gases to mix with the cooling water.|$|E
25|$|The first models, known generically as the T300s, {{all used}} a common piston {{diameter}} (76mm) {{in a common}} wet <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner.</b> Basic engine variations were achieved {{through the use of}} two specifications of piston stroke: 65mm to create individual cylinder capacity of 300cc, and 55mm to create a 250cc individual cylinder. Two 750cc models were released – and the Daytona and Trident 750 triples (3 x 250cc). There was one 1000cc model – the Daytona 1000 four (4 x 250cc). Two 900cc models were the Trophy 900 and Trident 900 triples (3 x 300cc). The Trophy 1200 four was the largest model (4 x 300cc). All were remarkably smooth running. The three cylinder models were equipped with a contra-rotating balance shaft mounted {{at the front of the}} engine. The four cylinder models benefitted from twin balance shafts – unique at the time – mounted beneath the crank shaft. Contemporary road tests noted the solidity and smoothness of performance as positives but the weight of the machines as negatives. For brand new machines produced by a totally new concern, there were remarkably few early problems. These were an insecure oil pressure switch and a longer-lived problem with the starter (or sprag clutch). The cosmetic finish on the first machines was simple and not very robust. Revisions to crankcases for the three-cylinder models in 1993, together with a move to high pressure casting, reduced engine weight considerably. All painting and plating operations were brought in house in 1993, as the Hinckley factory benefitted from further investment after the initial success of the range. The result was improved quality and durability of finish, added to the basic engineering integrity of the engine and chassis, made for a long-lasting and robust motorcycle.|$|E

50|$|Three engines {{have been}} produced: a 1.8 L, a 2.0 L, and a 2.4 L. With 1.8 L variant being used on {{vehicles}} sold {{outside of the}} United States. The initial design of the engine block and cylinder head was handled by Hyundai {{as part of the}} Global Engine Alliance. The engines feature an aluminum engine block with siamesed cast iron <b>cylinder</b> <b>liners</b> (that is <b>cylinder</b> <b>liners</b> that don't allow coolant to flow between adjacent <b>liners).</b> By using <b>cylinder</b> <b>liners</b> the engine's bore can be altered, therefore the displacement as well, just by adding a different set of <b>cylinder</b> <b>liners.</b> The engine also features an aluminum cylinder head with double overhead camshafts and variable valve timing.|$|R
