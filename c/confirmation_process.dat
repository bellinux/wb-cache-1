40|$|The Supreme Court is the {{ultimate}} interpreter {{of the meaning of}} the law in the United States. For this reason, nominations and confirmations of Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States have always been an important process. By being able to distinguish the <b>confirmation</b> <b>processes</b> for these nominees from one another, a more complete comprehension of the nomination process as a whole will further the understanding of the court, as well as its interactions with the other branches of the American government. The objective of this thesis is to compare and contrast the <b>confirmation</b> <b>processes</b> of Justices Roberts and Alito, exploring the reasons why the senate roll call vote for the two justices were so different, even though both candidates were confirmed. Justice Roberts was confirmed 78 - 22, while Justice Alito was confirmed by a 58 - 42 vote. What accounts for this startling 20 -vote difference in the senate’s voting? Essentially, the central hypothesis of the thesis is that several factors contributed to the greater divisions surrounding Alito’s confirmation versus the relative consensus by which Roberts was chosen, despite the fact that both are considered to be strong conservative judges. These factors include the character and personality of th...|$|R

We focus on contradiction resolution by a trustworthiness metric, computed by the popularity of the information in the reachable network and the ranking of the associated node. We further compare this resolution strategy with a another metric based on distrust, where the least trusted content is rejected.|$|R

Two applicants were proposed as subordinates: one high in sociability and competence and the other low in both dimensions. Although participants in the two conditions noticed the superiority of one candidate over the other, illegitimate powerholders selected the least sociable and competent subordinate more often than legitimate powerholders. Illegitimate participants also request more information about the best than about the worse candidate. We interpret our findings in light of the larger literature suggesting an impact of illegitimacy on people's attempts to rationalize and justify their position as well as to perpetuate the existing social arrangement...|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} {{wireless}} communication technology has brought new innovations {{as well as}} challenges to telecommunication. Consequently, the use of handheld devices such as mobile handsets, powered by the Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) networks is on the increase.

25|$|The {{appointment}} process {{stands in}} stark contrast with the highly public selection and <b>confirmation</b> <b>process</b> for justices of the Supreme Court of the United States.

Three Chief Justices (Sir Adrian Knox, Sir John Latham and Sir Garfield Barwick) had previously been conservative politicians prior to their appointment. However, there is frequent criticism of Barwick's intervention in the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, when he gave advice to Governor-General Sir John Kerr. On the other side of politics, Labor politicians Dr H. V. Evatt QC, Sir Edward McTiernan and Lionel Murphy QC were also appointed to the High Court; Murphy, Attorney-General in the Whitlam government, was criticised by the conservative side at the time of his appointment but after a decade in office had risen, on occasion, to the heights of Acting Chief Justice. His reputation was gravely damaged in 1985 after illegal police phone-tapping led to charges that he had attempted to pervert the course of justice. He was eventually acquitted of all charges.|$|E

40|$|This Essay {{questions}} Gerhardt and Stein’s {{interpretation of}} the golden age and whether there were meaningful differences {{in the politics of}} the nomination and <b>confirmation</b> <b>processes</b> of the antebellum era as compared with the contemporary era. In Part II, I suggest that one hallmark of the contemporary judicial selection process is the intense inquiry into the nominees’ personal lives and ethics (whether through confirmation hearings or the media). Gerhardt and Stein do not find much evidence of these practices in the antebellum era, even though historians have noted the nastiness of that era’s presidential election campaigns. Thus, some aspects of the imagined golden era may be true, while others may not. Then, the Essay highlights a few of Gerhardt and Stein’s most interesting findings of discontinuity between the antebellum and contemporary eras. While acknowledging the obvious discontinuities, Gerhardt and Stein emphasize the “patterns of practice that are similar to contemporary developments” 2 and argue that their research shows “surprisingly relative equivalence between the antebellum and contemporary periods. ” 3 Part III discusses how these findings further undercut the notion that a true golden age existed in judicial selection. This Essay draws from that aspect of their research, concluding that the golden age of modern political commentators’ imagination was more a judicial “bronze age” before the transportation and communication revolutions...|$|R

Experiment 4 : Effects of preference and expectation on information selection and interpretation, decision and stopping thresholds, and final decisions [...] 9. General discussion : The DHT model, implications for theories of confirmation bias and practical applications. When assessing a situation to choose the best action, confirmation bias is a potential problem. Confirmation bias is where the final decision is pulled towards the focal decision option. The focal decision option is whichever decision option {{is the focus of}} the individual’s attention. Attention commonly focuses on the decision option that is preferred (preferred decision option), the decision option that is expected to fit the situation (expected decision option), or the decision option that is suggested by the information provided (framed decision option). A framework is developed that breaks confirmation bias down into confirmation of preference, confirmation of expectation, and confirmation of frame, based on which decision option is the focus of attention. Confirmation bias is also distinguished from four groups of <b>confirmation</b> <b>processes.</b> A new model, the dynamic hypothesis testing (DHT) model, is developed towards a unified explanation of the three types of confirmation bias and the associated <b>confirmation</b> <b>processes.</b> Methods: Four experiments were conducted with university students paid for their time. Participants were required to make an action decision based on their situation assessment of a novel business competition scenario. Participants formed situation assessments and chose actions based on information they selected from a grid of information. Action preferences were manipulated in all four experiments. The situation supported by the information was manipulated in the third and fourth experiments. Results: In Experiments 1 and 2, the framed decision option influenced information selection when participants were asked to select all the information required prior to receiving the requested information, but the framed decision option had no effect on information selection when participants received the information immediately after selecting each item of information. Dynamic Hypothesis Testing: Mechanisms that drive decisions under uncertainty Experiments 3 and 4 found that the preferred and expected decision options influenced final situation assessments and chosen actions, but not information selection. Experiments 3 and 4 also found that the preferred decision option influenced decision thresholds, which determine which action is chosen given the situation assessment. Experiment 4 demonstrated that preferred and expected decision options influenced final situation assessments via information interpretation. Both information interpretations and situation assessments were exaggerated by the preferred and expected decision options compared to a yoked control group who were not required to make a decision. When the expected and preferred decision options opposed each other, there was some indication that the expected decision option had a greater influence on information interpretation and final situation assessments than the preferred decision option in this case. Discussion: Empirical findings are used to refine the DHT model. The DHT model provides advancement towards a unified explanation of confirmation of frame, expectation, and preference. A variety of processes that have been called confirmation bias are incorporated into the model and their relationship with confirmation outcomes are outlined. The DHT model expands on parallel constraint satisfaction mechanisms in an associative network to explain <b>confirmation</b> bias <b>processes</b> and outcomes.

500|$|Sotomayor's {{nomination}} won {{praise from}} Democrats and liberals, and Democrats {{appeared to have}} sufficient votes to confirm her. The strongest criticism of her nomination came from conservatives and some Republican senators regarding a line she had used in similar forms {{in a number of}} her speeches, particularly in a 2001 Berkeley Law lecture: [...] "I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life." [...] Sotomayor had made similar remarks in other speeches between 1994 and 2003, including one she submitted as part of her confirmation questionnaire for the Court of Appeals in 1998, but they had attracted little attention at the time. The remark now became widely known. The rhetoric quickly became inflamed, with radio commentator Rush Limbaugh and former Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich calling Sotomayor a [...] "racist" [...] (although the latter later backtracked from that claim), while John Cornyn and other Republican senators denounced such attacks but said that Sotomayor's approach was troubling. Backers of Sotomayor offered a variety of explanations in defense of the remark, and White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs stated that Sotomayor's word choice in 2001 had been [...] "poor". Sotomayor subsequently clarified her remark through Senate Judiciary Committee chair Patrick Leahy, saying that while life experience shapes who one is, [...] "ultimately and completely" [...] a judge follows the law regardless of personal background. Of her cases, the Second Circuit rulings in Ricci v. DeStefano received the most attention during the early nomination discussion, motivated by the Republican desire to focus on the reverse racial discrimination aspect of the case. In the midst of her <b>confirmation</b> <b>process</b> the Supreme Court overturned that ruling on June 29. A third line of Republican attack against Sotomayor was based on her ruling in Maloney v.
