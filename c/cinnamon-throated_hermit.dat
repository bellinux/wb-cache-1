50|$|There {{is quite}} some {{confusion}} about the taxonomic status of birds called Maranhao hermit. It is sometimes treated as a subspecies of the <b>cinnamon-throated</b> <b>hermit,</b> but at present most follow the analysis by Hinkelmann where it merely is considered the male plumage of P. nattereri. But as it seems, the Maranhao hermit only occurs {{in the northern part}} of the range of P. nattereri, and as the two have different voices they seem to warrant recognition as distinct species P. maranhaoensis. It is pending of confirmation by molecular work.|$|E
