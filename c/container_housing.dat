50|$|<b>Container</b> <b>Housing</b> {{units are}} related to the site and land {{occupied}} during {{a certain amount of time}} by the need of water supply and excavation, electricity, telecommunications, etc. Plug-in city is a concept that is developing as more units capable of moving by intermodal means are brought up to the market. Local site is thus of most importance on correct <b>container</b> <b>housing</b> units use. An example of CLU housing is at the Operation Enduring Freedom - Horn of Africa base (Camp Lemonnier) in Djibouti.|$|E

The patent documentation shows what are possibly the earliest recorded plans for constructing shipping <b>container</b> <b>housing</b> and shelters by laying out some very basic architectural concepts.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{structural}} properties {{of a low}} concentration ratio solar array are discussed. The assembled module consists of six interconnected containers which are compactly stowed in a volume of 3. 24 m(3) for delivery to orbit by the shuttle. The containers deploy in accordian fashion into a rectangular area of 19. 4 x 68 meters and can {{be attached to the}} user spacecraft along the longitudinal centerline of the end <b>container</b> <b>housing.</b> Five rotary incremental actuators requiring about 8 watts each will execute the 180 -degree rotation at each joint. Deployable masts (three per side) are used to extend endcaps from the housing in both directions. Each direction is extended by three masts requiring about 780 watts for about 27 minutes. Concentrator elements are extended by the endcaps and are supported by cable systems that are connected between the housings and endcaps. These power generating elements contain reflector panels which concentrate light onto the solar panels consisting of an aluminum radiator with solar cells positioned within the element base formed by the reflectors. A flat wire harness collects the power output of individual elements for transfer to the module <b>container</b> <b>housing</b> harnesses...|$|E

40|$|As {{part of the}} EDEN ISS project, a sea <b>container</b> <b>housing</b> a {{greenhouse}} {{will be sent to}} Antarctica. The purpose of this work is the adaptation of the MEC plant growth model for this greenhouse in order to estimate its productivity and {{to assess the impact of}} the major in uencing factors. The adaptation measure is split into two parts: The incorporation of the EDEN ISS plant selection which differs strongly from the original MEC plant selection and the actual modelling while accounting for the architecture of the greenhouse and integrating a scheduling function. Using the System Dynamics approach, a simulation tool has been created that accepts user input in the form of a cultivation plan and then estimates the edible and inedible biomass the greenhouse produces. However, due to insufficient data, not all of the EDEN ISS plants are represented in the program...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to {{investigate}} a design process in a multicultural society, in which challenges and potentials can arise, when designing a multicultural society. In addition to this, we want {{to investigate}} how included cultural differences can affect the presence of homeyness and homeyness feelings. To specify our field, we found the company Key Elements interesting, {{because they are in}} the process of designing <b>container</b> <b>housing</b> for refugees in Germany. We seek to understand the design process of the <b>container</b> <b>housing</b> project, understand the Syrian Muslim refugees who should inhabit these containers, as well as examine to what extend the users’ cultural differences are included in planning of the design process. In line with this, we want to examine the parameters and values Syrian Muslim refugees associate with home and home feelings. We have chosen to take a phenomenological approach to the projects survey, as we believe that our interviewee’s life-world on the phenomenon of domesticity is a knowledge that can obtain a sufficient validity and interact with our theoretical standpoint can argue for results that may mean some create trends that can be generalized. We have in line with this, chosen interviews as our principal method, because we believe that in this way we can create understanding of our interviewee’s life-world through semistructured life-world interview. In order to gain a deeper understanding of our problem formulation, we chose to read theories on multiculturalism, theories of homeyness, and theories of design processes, where the user is included in the process. This interaction of theories has given us the basis for an analysis of our empirical knowledge. Throughout the conduct completion of this project, we can conclude that, although homeyness is a complex phenomenon to define, it still is essential for human well-being. Furthermore, we can conclude that it is Key Elements’ task to incorporate preconditions for cultural ideas, which in the end can create the homeliness feeling among the users. We can conclude that this can be done through a design process that includes its users throughout the ! ! 4 ! planning, and not a process that is based solely on a Design Person approach. The use of a Design Person approach can, in the end, create a limitation for the users in their search for creating a feeling of homeyness...|$|E
