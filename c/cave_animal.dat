He gave it to Earl Franz von Hohenwart who was unable to determine the species, and gave the specimen in turn to Ferdinand J. Schmidt, a naturalist from Ljubljana. Schmidt recognized the beetle as a new species and described {{it in the paper}} Illyrisches Blatt (1832). He named it Leptodirus Hochenwartii after the donor, and also gave it Slovene name drobnovratnik and German Enghalskäfer, both meaning [...] "slender-necked (beetle)". The article represents the first formal description of a <b>cave</b> <b>animal</b> (the olm, described in 1768, wasn't recognized as a <b>cave</b> <b>animal</b> at the time).

The first formal study on cave organisms was conducted on the blind cave beetle.

40|$|As caves {{represent}} an extreme biotope with limited food sources, {{one might expect}} <b>cave</b> <b>animal</b> communities to exhibit low feeding specialization and to consume generally whatever organic matter is available. To test this hypothesis, we studied the feeding habits of several arthropod species in Slovakian and Romanian caves. A microanatomical approach utilizing histological methods was selected for this study. While saprophagous animals dominated, our study revealed variability within this nutritional group. Preferences ranged from fungal propagules (for the millipede Trachysphaera costata) to bacteria on bat guano (for the oribatid mite Pantelozetes cavaticus) and to cyanobacteria (for the microwhip scorpion Eukoenenia spelaea). The terrestrial isopod Mesoniscus graniger consumed a mixture of organic and inorganic substrates with plant material in various caves. These findings confirm an adaptability and phenoplasticity and, hence, a variability of characteristics developing {{under the pressure of}} extreme environmental factors...|$|E
40|$|Due {{to their}} {{fascinating}} biology and phenomena {{belonging to the}} realm of scientific curiosity, cave animals have been objects of study for zoologists for numerous decades. This chapter not only focuses on the extremes (e. g., absence of eyes, specialization to extreme environments), but also serves as an introduction to understand the geographic distribution patterns and history of these highly diverse ecological groups with their relict characteristics. After an introduction to the subterranean environment in Sect. 1, we briefly review the biology and ecology of cave animals with their regressive and progressive evolutionary tendencies {{in order to understand the}} innate reasons for restricted distribution patterns (Sect. 2).

Morphological {{features such as}} pale color, strongly reduced eyes and very long legs make it a typical <b>cave</b> <b>animal.</b> Surprisingly, it has also retained large wings {{and appears to be}} capable of flight which would make T. hajdi the first flying troglobiont worldwide, disproving previous beliefs that bats are the only animals capable of flying in complete darkness. Morphologically the new species does not readily fit within any described genus, but shares characteristics with genera both in the tribes "Metriocnemini" and "Orthocladiini". Bayesian molecular phylogenetic analysis using the markers COI, 18 S rDNAs, 28 S rDNA, CADI, and CADIV groups it with the genera Tvetenia, Cardiocladius and Eukiefferiella in the tribe "Metriocnemini". Troglocladius hajdi may be parthenogenetic, as only females were collected. The discovery confirms the position of the Dinaric arch as a highly important hotspot of subterranean biodiversity...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAnimals inhabiting the {{darkness}} of caves are generally blind and de-pigmented, regardless of the phylum they belong to. Survival in this environment is an enormous challenge, the most obvious being to find food and mates {{without the help of}} vision, and the loss of eyes in <b>cave</b> <b>animals</b> is often accompanied by an enhancement of other sensory apparatuses. Here we review the recent literature describing developmental biology and molecular evolution studies in order to discuss the evolutionary mechanisms underlying adaptation to life in the dark. We conclude that both genetic drift (neutral hypothesis) and direct and indirect selection (selective hypothesis) occurred together during the loss of eyes in <b>cave</b> <b>animals.</b> We also identify some future directions of research to better understand adaptation to total darkness, for which integrative analyses relying on evo-devo approaches associated with thorough ecological and population genomic studies should shed some light...|$|R
40|$|Cave fauna is an {{important}} component of biodiversity. Guangxi has the most spectacular Karst scenery in China beneath which lies a plenty of unexplored cave fauna. However, very little research has been carried out to document them. We collected and identified 180 <b>cave</b> <b>animal</b> specimens, from eight caves in Yachang Nature Reserve, Leye County, NW Guangxi between May and June of 2007. These specimensbelonged to 4 phyla, 10 classes, 20 orders, 31 families, and 36 species/groups. Among them, cave crickets, millipedes and spiders are the most widely occurring animals, while Cololembola, Scolopendromorpha, the mosquitoes and flies of Diptera are widely distributed. Blattaria and Neuroptera are only occasionally found. There are more cave animals in wet or longer caves than in dry or shorter ones. In the same cave, dry segment has less cave animals than wet segment. In general, moderate temperature, high humidity, a stable cave environment and an absence of exotic invasive species provides an ideal habitat for cave animals. Unfortunately, we found that some caves have been seriously damaged {{due to the lack of}} conservation, which threatens the survival of cave fauna. To avoid loss of Chinese cave biodiversity, we should arouse public awareness of protecting the cave environment.

40|$|Published {{online at}} www. senckenberg. de/arthropod-systematics on 8. iv. 2014. Cave animals have evolved {{specialised}} morphological and behavioural adaptations {{to a dark}} and stable environment. When their ances-tors were surface species living in continental climates, and thus adapted to annual changes from extreme cold to extreme warm periods, it is highly intriguing how adaptation to cave stable temperature took place. The phylogenetic history of the <b>cave</b> <b>animal</b> can thus help to understand the kind of adaptation process undergone in such a different environment. Here we perform a mitochondrial DNA-based phylogeny for the only Palearctic cave-restricted plecopteran species (Protonemura gevi), whose geographic range {{is limited to a}} single cave in the south of the Iberian Peninsula, also including four other Iberian and Moroccan Protonemura species and two other species from different genera as outgroup taxa. Our results indicate that P. gevi shows a genetic distance with P. culmenis being an order of magnitude lower than those with the remaining Protonemura species. Using a relaxed molecular clock, phylogeny dating suggests that their common ancestor probably lived 1. 4 million years ago, i. e. during Pleistocene. P. culmenis currently lives in the Pyrenees, so that it is conceivable that this species (or the common ancestor of both) migrated to a southern refuge during one of Pleistocene glaciations, and a few individu...|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{the process}} of {{evolution}} {{is one of the great}} challenges in biology. <b>Cave</b> <b>animals</b> are one group with immense potential to address the mechanisms of evolutionary change. Amazingly, similar morphological alterations, such as enhancement of sensory systems and the loss of eyes and pigmentation, have evolved multiple times in a diverse assemblage of <b>cave</b> <b>animals.</b> Our goal is to develop an invertebrate model to study cave evolution so that, in combination with a previously established vertebrate cave system, we can address genetic questions concerning evolutionary parallelism and convergence. We chose the isopod crustacean, Asellus aquaticus, and generated a genome-wide linkage map for this species. Our map, composed of 117 markers, of which the majority are associated with genes known to be involved in pigmentation, eye, and appendage development, was used to identify loci of large effect responsible for several pigmentation traits and eye loss. Our study provides support for the prediction that significant morphological change can be mediated through one or a few genes. Surprisingly, we found that within population variability in eye size occurs through multiple mechanisms; eye loss has a different genetic basis than reduced eye size. Similarly, again within a population, the phenotype of albinism can be achieved by two different genetic pathways—either by a recessive genotype at one locus or doubly recessive genotypes at two other loci. Our work shows the potential of Asellus for studying the extremes of parallel and convergent evolution—spanning comparisons within populations to comparisons between vertebrate and arthropod systems...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cave</b> <b>animals</b> have {{historically}} {{attracted the attention}} of evolutionary biologists because of their bizarre ‘regressive’ characters and convergent evolution. However, understanding of their biogeographic and evolutionary history, including mechanisms of speciation, has remained elusive. In the last decade, molecular data have been obtained for subterranean taxa and their surface relatives, which have allowed some of the classical debates on the evolution of cave fauna to be revisited. Here, we review some of the major studies, focusing on the contribution of phylogeography in the following areas: biogeographic history and the relative roles of dispersal and vicariance, colonization history, cryptic species diversity and modes of speciation of <b>cave</b> <b>animals.</b> We further consider the limitations of current research and prospects for the future. Phylogeographic studies have confirmed that cave species are often cryptic, with highly restricted distributions, but have also shown that their divergence and potential speciation may occur despite the presence of gene flow from surface populations. Significantly, phylogeographic studies have provided evidence for speciation and adaptive evolution within the confines of cave environments, questioning the assumption that cave species evolved directly from surface ancestors. Recent technical developments involving ‘next generation’ DNA sequencing and theoretical developments in coalescent and population modelling are likely to revolutionize the field further, particularly in the study of speciation and the genetic basis of adaptation and convergent evolution within subterranean habitats. In summary, phylogeographic studies have provided an unprecedented insight into the evolution of these unique fauna, {{and the future of the}} field should be inspiring and data rich.
