40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{illustrate}} how to conceive, implement and play adaptive Units of Learning (UoLs) that embed educational videogames while adopting a by example approach. For this purpose we describe The Art & Craft of chocolate UoL, {{with the game}} Paniel and the chocolate-based sauce adventure as a key feature. This game introduces learners to the preparation of <b>chocolate</b> <b>sauces</b> and the marrying of such sauces with different dishes. The UoL includes a preliminary test to measure the learner’s prior knowledge on the subject. The outcome of this test is used to adapt the game. Finally, the UoL also assesses the learning process according to an in-game exam. This UoL has been modeled using IMS Learning Design (LD), and the embedded game has been developed using the educational game engine. This UoL may be deployed in any LD-compliant environment, {{although some of the}} features like the adaptation of the game or automatic assessment require special plug-ins that enable the communication between the environment and the engine. These plug-ins have been developed as an open-source modification of the SLeD player...|$|R
