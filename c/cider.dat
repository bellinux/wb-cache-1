5|$|Shepton Mallet is home {{to three}} {{international}} alcoholic drinks producers. The Gaymer <b>Cider</b> Company, a subsidiary of C Group, produces Blackthorn and Gaymer's Olde English <b>cider.</b> However this producer is closing in 2016. Constellation Brands, former owners of Gaymers, produces Babycham. Family-run Brothers Drinks produces Brothers <b>Cider</b> and runs a contract bottling operation for many other drinks companies. In October 2016 {{it was announced that}} the <b>cider</b> factory and bottling plant would be taken over by Brothers Drinks, makers of Brothers <b>Cider.</b>|$|E

40|$|International audienceA set of 90 <b>ciders</b> {{among them}} 50 “brut” (near dry), 30 “demi-sec” (half dry) and 10 “doux” (sweet) were {{collected}} and analysed {{to get a}} data base of about 180 variables including processing conditions, sensory descriptors and physicochemical variables. This data set was treated by a multiple factor analysis (MFA) using the sensory and analytical data as active variables whereas the “processing conditions” data were introduced as illustrative variables. Two MFAs was carried out separating the less sweet (“bruts”) from the sweeter (“demi secs” and “doux”) <b>ciders.</b> For both sets, the MFAs showed a strong polarization of the <b>ciders</b> characteristics: fruity/flowery flavours are associated with cooked flavours and opposed to the descriptors “animal” (animal), “sous-bois” (underwood), “fond de cuve” (vat dregs) themselves associated with bitterness and astringency and also “pomme/cidre” (cider/apple) flavours. The industrial <b>ciders</b> located on axis 1 near the fruity and cooked odours whereas the <b>ciders</b> of small scale producers were close to the second group of flavours and tastes...|$|R
5|$|Fruit in the {{traditional}} cottage garden would have included an apple and a pear, for <b>cider</b> and perry, gooseberries and raspberries. The modern cottage garden includes many varieties of ornamental fruit and nut trees, such as crabapple and hazel, along with non-traditional trees like dogwood.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, {{the town}} is home to local offices for Defra, the Charity Commission for England and Wales, and General Electric. The first ever store of the {{multinational}} clothing retailer New Look opened in Taunton in 1969. Taunton is also famous {{for the production of}} <b>cider.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 20 December, Canadian forces {{tried again}} and The Royal Canadian Regiment {{attacked}} <b>Cider</b> Crossroads at noon. This time, Vokes {{was determined that}} the operation would be successful, with armoured forces of the Three Rivers Regiment moving to the start lines well before 07:00. Due to shortages of fuel and poor weather, H-Hour was postponed until 14:15. When H-Hour came, a powerful creeping barrage supported two companies of the Royal Canadian Regiment eastward. By evening, B Company controlled the <b>Cider</b> Crossroads, having met virtually no resistance in their advance to the objective. However, German forces had already evacuated The Gully, falling back {{to prepare for a}} strong defence of Ortona, with elements of the powerful 1st Parachute Division firmly entrenched in the town.|$|E
40|$|Summary A rapid high {{performance}} liquid chromatography (HPLC) method {{based on the}} formation of dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) derivatives was developed {{for the analysis of}} the major sulphite binding carbonyls in fermented <b>ciders</b> (acetaldehyde, pyruvate, a-ketoglutarate, galacturonic acid and L-xylosone). The synthesis of the DNPH derivative of L-xylosone, for use as an analytical standard, is also described. These data were used to calculate the predicted sulphite binding power of fermented <b>ciders</b> at various levels of free sulphur dioxide. Analysis of free and bound sulphur dioxide in the <b>ciders,</b> after equilibration with known amounts of added sulphite, was used to calculate the experimental sulphite binding power. These techniques were applied to a major study of sulphite binding in <b>ciders</b> which is reported in an accompanying paper...|$|R
40|$|This study {{determined}} benzoic and {{sorbic acid}} contents in Brazilian wines and <b>ciders</b> {{in order to}} verify whether these preservatives are used in accordance with Brazilian regulations. Forty-nine samples of commercially available wines (35 red wines, 11 white wines and 3 <b>ciders)</b> were analyzed by HPLC coupled to a photodiode array detector. Although the use of benzoic acid in wines and <b>ciders</b> is not permitted, this preservative was detected in three samples, one wine and two <b>ciders,</b> which contained benzoic acid levels of 295. 6, 424. 7 and 608. 4 mg. L- 1, respectively. Sorbic acid was detected in 49 % of the analyzed samples, with levels ranging from 91. 0 to 309. 5 mg. L- 1. Considering only the samples containing sorbic acid, the mean content detected was 171. 2 mg. L- 1. Six red wine samples presented sorbic acid content above the maximum level allowed by Brazilian regulations. The results showed that, in some cases, the content of benzoic and sorbic acids in wines and <b>ciders,</b> {{as well as their}} labels, do not meet current national regulations...|$|R

5|$|The Attic Bar is a venue {{located in}} Stokes Croft. Equipped {{with a sound}} system and stage which are used every weekend for gigs of every genre, the bar and the {{connected}} Full Moon Pub were rated by The Guardian, a British daily paper, {{as one of the}} top ten clubs in the UK. Located by Bristol's harbourside, The Apple is a <b>cider</b> bar located by Bristol's harbour side which opened in 2004, in a converted Dutch barge, offering a range of 40 different ciders. In 2014, the Great British Pub Awards ranked The Apple as the best <b>cider</b> bar in the UK.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{farming and}} its {{associated}} industries, including making <b>cider,</b> cheese and yoghurt, and peat extraction, the county has little industry. It {{has been involved in}} the manufacture of helicopters, some heavy industries related to defence, quarrying and the mining of gravels and sands, brick-making and tile-making, and the manufacture of slippers, boots and shoes, but many of these industries have declined. Tourism {{is one of the main}} sources of income.|$|E
5|$|John Nott's The Cooks and Confectioners Dictionary (1723), {{still with}} rather few {{precedents}} to go by, chose an alphabetical treatment for its recipes, from Al to Zest. The book covered everything from soups and salads to meat and fish, {{as well as}} pastries of many kinds, confectionery, {{and the making of}} beer, <b>cider,</b> and wine. Bills of fare are given for each month of the year.|$|E
40|$|Hen {{egg white}} {{lysozyme}} (HEWL) is an enzyme used in alcoholic fermentations {{for its ability}} to control the growth of Gram-positive bacteria and spoilage bacteria, without inhibiting yeast growth, and it allows reducing the use of sulphur dioxide. Nevertheless, considering the potential allergenicity of this protein, the presence of HEWL should be declared on the label of the final product. In this work, we analysed 18 commercial Italian <b>ciders</b> by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and found traces of HEWL in 12 samples without label declaration. We used western blot and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) to verify the immunological activity of HEWL, and to quantify its content in the <b>ciders.</b> Two out of 18 samples resulted positive both to Immunoblot and ELISA. Our results indicate the requirement of a more stringent control of the commercial <b>ciders</b> and the need of label declaration for <b>ciders</b> treated with such compounds...|$|R

5|$|Stout, {{a kind of}} porter beer, {{particularly}} Guinness, {{is typically}} associated with Ireland, although historically it was more closely associated with London. Porter remains very popular, although it has lost sales since the mid-20th century to lager. <b>Cider,</b> particularly Magners (marketed in the Republic of Ireland as Bulmers), is also a popular drink. Red lemonade, a soft-drink, is consumed on its own and as a mixer, particularly with whiskey.|$|E

40|$|An {{analytical}} method for {{the determination of}} free amino acids in <b>ciders</b> is reported. It is based on high-performance liquid chromatography with an automatic precolumn derivatization with o-phthaldehyde and 3 -mercaptopropionic acid and diode array detection. The method was applied to monitor the amino acids during second fermentation of sparkling <b>ciders.</b> This paper reports the influence of yeast strains and aging time on the amino acid composition of sparkling <b>ciders.</b> The application of principal component analysis enables the <b>ciders</b> to be differentiated {{on the basis of}} the two factors considered (yeast strain and aging time). The first principal component, which accounts for 58 % of the total variance, achieved the separation according to aging time with serine, glycine, alanine, valine, ornithine, leucine, and lysine as the most important variables. The second principal component, accounting for 28 % of the explained variance, is closely related to aspartic acid and asparagine and separates the samples according to the yeast strain...|$|R

5|$|Well {{into the}} eighteenth century, the Chesapeake region still relied on home-brewed <b>cider</b> {{as a primary}} beverage. In most small planters' households, women were {{responsible}} for the production of the drink and relied on local products to make the different ciders. This production was seasonal, as only large planters had the funds and the technology necessary to produce alcohol year round.|$|E
5|$|Coate's <b>cider</b> {{factory in}} Nailsea was first opened in 1788 and {{was bought by}} Showerings of Shepton Mallet in 1956. The brand was {{subsequently}} merged with Gaymers and absorbed by Matthew Clark Brands. Prior to Coates, there was Heath Brewery, owned by the Thatcher family, which was situated behind the former Friendship Inn. The site of the old factory is now called 'Coates Estate' and {{is home to a}} diverse range of both local and national businesses.|$|E
5|$|Expansion of the {{population}} and settlements in the county continued during the Tudor and more recent periods. Agriculture and coal mining expanded until the 18th century, although other industries declined during the industrial revolution. In modern times {{the population}} has grown, particularly in the seaside towns, notably Weston-super-Mare. Agriculture continues to be a major business, if no longer a major employer because of mechanisation. Light industries are based in towns such as Bridgwater and Yeovil. The towns of Taunton and Shepton Mallet manufacture <b>cider,</b> although the acreage of apple orchards is less than it once was.|$|E
