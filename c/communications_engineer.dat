25|$|During World War II, an {{air raid}} siren {{built by the}} chief <b>communications</b> <b>engineer</b> for the University, Jack Maguire, was placed {{on top of the}} Tower to notify Austin {{residents}} of incoming air attack.

25|$|After several months, Chikatilo {{found a job}} as a <b>communications</b> <b>engineer</b> in a town located {{north of}} Rostov-on-Don. He {{relocated}} to Russia in 1961, renting a small apartment close to his workplace. The same year, his younger sister, Tatyana, finished her schooling and moved into his apartment (his parents would relocate to the Rostov-on-Don region shortly thereafter). Tatyana lived with her brother for six months before marrying a local youth and moving into her in-laws' home; she noted nothing untoward with regard to her brother's lifestyle, except his chronic shyness around women, and resolved to help her brother find a wife and start a family.|$|E

2500|$|In February 1951, the FCC decided Hush-A-Phone's {{complaint}} {{should be}} dismissed, but held the case {{open for the}} next seven years, permitting further pleadings and reconsideration. A letter to the editor of The Washington Post by John P. Roberts, a <b>communications</b> <b>engineer,</b> described the FCC decision [...] "an invasion of the rights of the individual", adding [...] "even if this quality deterioration had been satisfactorily demonstrated, it is hard to understand why the FCC should have the power to forbid my use of the Hush-A-Phone if I choose to accept the deterioration in quality for the sake of increased privacy". On March 23, 1951, Hush-A-Phone and Harry C. Tuttle submitted filings to the FCC reporting scientific tests proving that the Hush-A-Phone [...] "actually causes a net increase in 'transmission efficiency [...] of the telephone circuit" [...] and that AT and affiliates were [...] "public utility monopolies unlawfully interfering with the natural and inherent rights of a subscriber". [...] FCC official Jack Werner's suggestion was that the telephone company should suspend service to any consumer failing to comply with the regulation prohibiting foreign attachments.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe near-optimal {{performance}} of the turbo decoder {{has been a source}} of intrigue among <b>communications</b> <b>engineers</b> and information theorists, given its ad hoc origins that were seemingly disconnected from optimization theory. Naturally one would inquire whether the favorable performance might be explained by characterizing the turbo decoder via some optimization criterion or performance index. Recently, two such characterizations have surfaced. One draws from statistical mechanics and aims to minimize the Bethe approximation to a free energy measure. The other characterization involves constrained likelihood estimation, a setting perhaps more familiar to <b>communications</b> <b>engineers.</b> The intent of this paper is to assemble a tutorial overview of these recent developments, and more importantly to identify the formal mathematical duality between the two viewpoints. The paper includes tutorial background material on the information geometry tools used in analyzing the turbo decoder, and the analysis accommodates both the parallel concatenation and serial concatenation schemes in a common framewor...|$|R
