25|$|Controller-General of Finances (<b>contrôleur</b> général des finances, {{formerly}} {{called the}} surintendant des finances).|$|E
25|$|Conseil des dépêches ("Council of Messages", {{concerning}} notices {{and administrative}} {{reports from the}} provinces) – composed of the king, the chancellor, the secretaries of state, the <b>contrôleur</b> général des finances, and other councillors according to the issues discussed.|$|E
25|$|Until 1715, {{the council}} met twice a week. After this date, {{financial}} {{decisions were made}} by the king in one-on-one meetings with the <b>contrôleur</b> général des finances, and the council merely rubber-stamped their decisions without much debate. Under the Regent Philippe II, Duke of Orléans and then under Louis XV, the council met every Tuesday. From around 1728–1730, its rhythm slowed to less than once a week, and during the years 1730–1740, it met only once every two weeks.|$|E

60|$|Monsieur Durand {{had indeed}} not exaggerated {{when he spoke}} of M. le <b>Contrôleur's</b> bedchamber being overcrowded this same eventful morning.|$|R
25|$|The {{council was}} {{the largest of the}} royal councils, and was {{composed}} of the chancellor, princes of the royal bloodline ("princes du sang"), dukes with peerage ("ducs et pairs"), the ministers and secretaries of state, the <b>contrôleur</b> général des finances, the 30 councillors of state, the 80 maître des requêtes and the intendants of finance. In general however, only the counsellors of state, the maîtres des requêtes and (at times) the intendants of finances attended regularly. Meetings were composed of generally 40 or so members, and rarely more than 60 members.|$|E
2500|$|Conseil d'en haut ("High Council", {{concerning}} {{the most important}} matters of state) – composed of the king, the crown prince (the [...] "dauphin"), the chancellor, the <b>contrôleur</b> général des finances, {{and the secretary of}} state in charge of foreign affairs.|$|E
2500|$|Conseil royal des {{finances}} ("Royal Council of Finances") – {{composed of}} the king, the [...] "chef du conseil des finances" [...] (an honorary post), the chancellor, the <b>contrôleur</b> général des finances {{and two of his}} counsellors, and the intendants of finance.|$|E
50|$|The {{town was}} part of the Dutch Empire until Indonesia won {{independence}} in 1945-49. The Dutch <b>controleurs</b> house survives as a testament of that era.|$|R
6000|$|... "Until I came," [...] {{she said}} quietly. [...] "I am glad of that, for 'twill be easy enough, I hope, to {{convince}} your Majesty that my presence can {{have made no}} difference to M. le <b>Contrôleur's</b> attitude of deep respect." ...|$|R
60|$|Then, as King Louis gave a sharp {{ejaculation}} of impatience, Mme. de Pompadour broke in, in tones {{which she}} knew how to render velvety and soothing to the ear, whilst her delicate fingers rested lightly on M. le <b>Contrôleur's</b> hand.|$|R
2500|$|F.F.A.H. Brennecke, {{a railway}} {{operation}} <b>controleur,</b> {{is the first}} registered owner of the house at Bahnhoffstraße 37. In 1900, it became Hotel Victoria and Hotel [...] "Viktoria" [...] in 1920 run by Jan Draheim. It is still a hotel today, [...] "Hotel Centralny".|$|E
2500|$|The {{council was}} made up of the king, the [...] "chef du conseil des finances" [...] (an honorary, but well-paid, post), the crown prince, {{occasionally}} the chancellor, the <b>contrôleur</b> général des finances and (generally) two of his consellors, and the intendants of finance.|$|E
2500|$|Conseil privé or Conseil des {{parties or}} Conseil d'État ("Privy Council" [...] or [...] "Council of State", {{concerning}} the judicial system, officially instituted in 1557) – {{the largest of}} the royal councils, composed of the chancellor, the dukes with peerage, the ministers and secretaries of state, the <b>contrôleur</b> général des finances, the 30 councillors of state, the 80 maître des requêtes and the intendants of finance.|$|E
60|$|In the {{meantime}} M. Achille had, with becoming reverence, taken M. le <b>Contrôleur's</b> coat and waistcoat in his august hands, {{and stood there}} holding them with just that awed expression of countenance which a village curé would wear when handling a reliquary.|$|R
50|$|In February 1855, {{he succeeded}} his father, {{to the post}} of Chief Engraver of the Paris Mint. He wrote Graveurs Généraux et particuliers des Monnaies de France, <b>Contrôleurs</b> Généraux des Effigies, Noms de quelques graveurs en Médailles de la Renaissance Française, {{published}} in 1867.|$|R
5000|$|To keep a {{close watch}} on {{developments}} outside the capital, Tunisia's new rulers organised the <b>contrôleurs</b> civils. These French officials replicated, at the local level, of the Resident-General, closely supervising the qaids and cheikhs. [...] After 1884, a network of <b>contrôleurs</b> civils overlay the qaids' administration throughout the country, except in the extreme south. There, because of the more hostile nature of the tribes and the tenuous hold of the central government, military officers, making up a Service des Renseignements (Intelligence Service), fulfilled this duty. Successive Residents-General, fearing the soldiers' tendency toward direct rule — which belied the official French myth that Tunisians continued to govern Tunisia — worked to bring the Service des Renseignements under their control, finally doing {{so at the end}} of the century.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "Conseil des Dépêches" [...] ("Council of Messages") {{oversaw the}} notices and {{administrative}} {{reports from the}} provinces sent by the governors and intendants, and thus dealt with domestic affairs coming under the purview of all four Secretaries of State. Created in 1650, it was originally presided by the Chancellor, but the King began to preside it himself from 1661 on. This council {{was made up of}} ten to twelve members: the first minister (when one existed), the crown prince, the chancellor, the ministers of state and the secretaries of state, the <b>contrôleur</b> général des finances. Other councillors of state or maîtres des requêtes attended according to the issues discussed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{eighteenth century}} saw the {{construction}} of thirty new fountains, of which fourteen still survive, and the building of three châteaux d'eau, water reservoirs located inside large structures. [...] Many of these fountains were the work of Jean Beausire, who, by royal edict, was <b>Contrôleur</b> des bâtiments {{of the city of}} Paris between 1692 and 1740. [...] His fountains were usually small, set against a wall, with a niche and a single spout pouring water into a small basin, but they were dignified and elegant, decorated [...] with seashells, mythological figures, and sometimes had imitations of the calcified walls of grottos, imitating natural springs.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the time}} of the victory at Cassel until the 1690s, Philippe mainly {{concentrated}} his energies on the expansion of his estates, personal fortune, and art collection, including the renovation of his residences, the Palais Royal and the Château de Saint-Cloud. The latter was his favourite residence, the home of an ever-expanding and [...] "stormy" [...] court. Philippe became an important patron of the artists Jean Nocret and Pierre Mignard, both of whom were employed to elaborate the décor at Saint Cloud and the Palais Royal. [...] As early as 1660, Philippe also ordered Antoine Lepautre to begin extensions at Saint Cloud; later he became <b>contrôleur</b> général of Philippe's properties.|$|E
5000|$|... 1964 : {{scission}} of {{the corps}}: {{the corps of}} the TNA remains, despite the departure of air traffic controllers and electricians, respectively to the new corps of [...] "Officiers <b>Contrôleurs</b> de la Circulation Aérienne" [...] (OCCA) - became air traffic controller after that - dans those of electricians - became Air Traffic Safety Electronics Personnel.|$|R
60|$|He laughed till his fat sides ached, {{and tears}} {{streamed}} from his eyes; then, amidst discreet murmurs of admiration at so much condescension, such gracious good humour, the ceremony of putting on M. le <b>Contrôleur's</b> coat was at last {{performed by the}} King of France, and milor, now fully clothed and apparently much relieved in his mind, was able to present his respects to Madame de Pompadour.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then we'll {{call that}} settled," [...] {{concluded}} his Majesty, pushing back his chair preparatory to ending this conversation, {{which he had}} so dreaded and which had turned out so highly satisfactory. Pity about that million livres, of course! five hundred thousand might have done, certainly seven! Nathless, M. le <b>Contrôleur's</b> private fortune was not so large as popular rumour had it, or did Mme. Lydie actually hold the purse strings? ...|$|R
60|$|M. le <b>Contrôleur</b> seemed satisfied, {{and there}} was little else to say. Louis XV began to regret that he had offered him quite so much. Apparently five hundred {{thousand}} would have been enough.|$|E
6000|$|... "His Grace hath offered us, as man to man, fifteen {{millions}} livres for {{the person}} of the Pretender," [...] said the King, with sudden decision, and looking M. le <b>Contrôleur</b> straight in the face.|$|E
6000|$|... "We only seem to {{last long}} enough to make love {{thoroughly}} to half a dozen pretty women in a lifetime," [...] replied M. le <b>Contrôleur,</b> as he gallantly raised her fingers to his lips.|$|E
50|$|Ginger {{then gets}} Lia {{to sneak out}} of the {{classroom}} of Martha Jones. The homesick man tells Lia of England. Martha has him arrested. He is sentenced to three months on the road gang, but that does not satisfy the puritanical pair of Martha Jones and her missionary brother. They want him deported, but Ginger is the <b>Controleur's</b> only real local friend, so he sends him to alcohol-free Agor Island to try to reform him.|$|R
60|$|The buzz of {{talk was}} going on as loudly and incessantly as before. The whispered {{conversation}} around M. le <b>Contrôleur's</b> bedside had excited no violent curiosity. The first surprise occasioned by His Majesty's unparalleled condescension soon gave way to indifference; {{it was obvious that}} the King's assiduity beside the Minister of Finance was solely due to a more than normal desire for money, and these royal demands for renewed funds were too numerous to cause more than passing interest.|$|R
60|$|Mme. de Stainville's rose-coloured gown {{was the one}} vivid {{patch of}} colour in the picture of {{delicate}} hues. She stood close to M. le <b>Contrôleur's</b> bedside and unceremoniously {{turned her back on}} the rest of the company; we must presume that she was a very privileged visitor, for no one--not even Monseigneur le Prince de Courtenai--ventured to approach within earshot. It was understood that in milor's immediate entourage la belle Irène alone was allowed to be frivolous, and we are told that she took full advantage of this permission.|$|R
60|$|But {{then nothing}} ever did go wrong. France went on {{just the same}} as she had done before some of her more meddlesome Parliaments insisted on having a Comptroller of Finance at the head of affairs. Mme. de Pompadour still {{spent a great deal of}} money, and the King still {{invariably}} paid her debts; whereupon, his pockets being empty, he applied to M. le <b>Contrôleur</b> for something with which to replenish them. M. le <b>Contrôleur</b> thereupon ordered M. Achille to bring one more cup of aromatic chocolate for Mme. de Pompadour, whilst His Majesty the King spent an uncomfortable quarter of an hour with Mme. la Marquise d'Eglinton.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here is M. le <b>Contrôleur</b> too bashful {{to sit on}} {{the edge}} of his own bed in my presence," [...] she continued, still laughing. [...] "Nay, milor, I'll wager that you were {{reclining}} on those downy cushions when you were flirting with Mme. de Stainville." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "His Grace's letter, milor," [...] he {{said with}} final supreme condescension, and holding the {{document}} out to M. le <b>Contrôleur,</b> who took it without a word. [...] "Do you glance through it, and see {{that we have not}} been mistaken, that the whole thing is clear, straightforward and----" ...|$|E
60|$|It was the Duke's turn {{to scrutinize}} his daughter's face, vaguely {{wondering}} if she had spoken in bitterness, not altogether sorry if this new train of thought were to divert her mind from that eternal subject of the moribund Stuart cause, which seemed to have become an obsession with her. He half-turned in the direction where Lydie's eyes were still fixed, and saw a patch of bright rose colour, clear and vivid against the dull hangings of M. le <b>Contrôleur's</b> couch, whilst the elegant outline of a woman's stately form stood between his line of vision and {{the face of his}} son-in-law.|$|R
60|$|Then all the {{distinguished}} gentlemen who stood nearest to him {{would have known}} what to do. They had all attended petits levers of kings, courtisanes, and Ministers, ever since their rank and dignities entitled them so to do. Mme. la Comtesse de Stainville, for instance, would have stepped aside at this precise juncture with a deep curtsey and mayhap a giggle or a smirk--since she was privileged to be frivolous--whereupon M. Achille would with the proper decorum due to so solemn a function have handed M. le <b>Contrôleur's</b> day shirt to the visitor of highest rank there present, who was privileged to pass it over milor's head.|$|R
60|$|Apparently {{there was}} to be no end to royal graciousness this morning, as every one who looked could see. Hardly was the coat on M. le <b>Contrôleur's</b> {{shoulders}} than the King engaged him in conversation, whilst Mme. de Pompadour dropped into the armchair lately vacated by Monseigneur de Courtenai. The well-drilled circle of courtiers and ladies, including la belle Irène herself, retired discreetly. Once more there was a barrier of emptiness and parquet flooring round the inner group, now composed of His Majesty, of M. le Contrôleur-Général, and of Mme. de Pompadour. Into these sacred precincts no one would have dared to step. Lydie, having paid her respects to His Majesty, had not joined that intimate circle, and it seemed as if Louis XV had noted her absence, and was duly relieved thereat.|$|R
