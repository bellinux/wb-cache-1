25|$|Other advancements {{on the car}} {{include the}} <b>clutchless</b> direct shift {{technology}} within the gearbox, a new fluid traction control system to replace the previous 2001 traction control system, and upright aerodynamically shaped periscopic exhaust outlets at the rear. The latter technology was incorporated both to use the hot exhaust gases for aerodynamic effect and to raise these gases higher and out {{the way of the}} rear suspension. On previous occasion Ferrari's non chimneyed top exiting exhaust outlets had caused the rear suspension and other elements {{at the rear of the}} car to overheat or even melt when minor cracks occurred.|$|E
500|$|The {{sequential}} shifting three speed gearbox was manually shifted, but <b>clutchless,</b> {{without the}} need for a clutch lever control, using instead a centrifugal clutch along with a plate clutch slaved to the footchange lever to engage and disengage the gearbox from the engine. While not intuitive to learn, once the rider got used to it, the semi-automatic transmission, [...] "took the terror out of motorcycling" [...] for novice riders. Unlike many scooter CVTs, the centrifugal clutch made it possible to push start the Super Cub, a useful advantage if the need arose.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] {{four-cylinder engine}} was offered between 1968 and 1970, then was dropped {{due to lack}} of {{interest}} (besides its other usage in the Jeep DJ-5A a.k.a. the Postal Jeep or a marine/industrial engine) and to clear the field for the Vega. Far more popular were the [...] six-cylinder and the base [...] V8, which replaced the [...] V8 offered in previous years. Several units were produced with the , , engine, four-barrel quadrajet carb and four-speed Saginaw transmission with a heavy duty 12 bolt positraction rear as a [...] "towing option' package. At mid-year, a semi-automatic transmission based on the Powerglide called the Torque-Drive (RPO MB1) was introduced as a low-cost option (~$100 less than the Powerglide) for <b>clutchless</b> motoring. The Torque-Drive transmission was only offered with the four and six-cylinder engines. The two-speed Powerglide was still the only fully automatic transmission available with most engines, as the more desirable three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic was only available with the largest V8 engines.|$|E

50|$|The BRP Can-Am Spyder Roadster is {{available}} with a <b>clutchless</b> automatic transmission (the SE5 or SE6, with {{five or six}} speeds, depending on the model).|$|E
50|$|The Spyder {{also has}} {{front and rear}} brakes which are both {{actuated}} by the same foot pedal, a reverse gear, power steering and an optional electric shift (<b>clutchless)</b> transmission.|$|E
5000|$|CT110s {{are well}} {{regarded}} for their extreme reliability, economy {{and ease of}} operation. The <b>clutchless</b> four speed transmission (centrifugal clutch) {{does not require a}} clutch lever. In Australia and New Zealand the freeing of the left hand of the rider makes mail delivery easier for postal workers, or [...] "posties".|$|E
5000|$|The 1939 Oldsmobiles were {{available}} with the [...] "Safety Automatic Transmission" [...] {{and not with}} the Hydramatic. The safety automatic transmission was semi-automatic, in that it still used a clutch to get the car going and then shifted automatically. The Hydramatic Transmission, a fully, <b>clutchless</b> automatic transmission debuted in the 1940 model year.|$|E
50|$|A {{probable}} {{production car}} {{would use a}} <b>clutchless</b> one- or two-speed transmission with no reverse gear as the electric motor can spin forward or in reverse. Ruf engaged Calmotors in Camarillo, California, specialized {{in the implementation of}} hybrid electric and electric only powertrain design, to combine the latest generation of lithium-ion batteries with its motor.|$|E
50|$|Later {{cars had}} {{shallower}} doors. In 1950, the Vanguard and the Triumph Renown {{were the first}} cars to be fitted with a Laycock de Normanville <b>clutchless</b> overdrive controlled from the gearlever. The Phase 2 car was available with the Laycock overdrive that operated on {{the second and third}} gears of the three-speed transmission, creating, in effect, a five-speed gearbox.|$|E
50|$|Since 1973, {{the most}} popular {{transmission}} was the Lenco planetary design, first used as a four-speed and now as a five-speed. Although the five-speed unit (usually air-shifted) is still used in ADRL and Mountain Motor Pro Stock Association and in Air-Shifted three-speed units in Pro Modified, NHRA Pro Stocks utilize a Liberty or G-Force five-speed <b>clutchless</b> manual transmission.|$|E
50|$|The {{operation}} of semi-automatic transmissions has evolved as vehicle manufacturers experimented with different systems. In one early mass-production example, Ferrari offered their Mondial {{model with a}} <b>clutchless</b> manual, which Ferrari called the Valeo transmission. In this system, the gear stick of a traditional manual transmission was retained; moving the shifter automatically engaged the electro-hydraulic clutch. Saab's Sensonic transmission worked in a similar fashion.|$|E
50|$|The third {{version of}} INVECS was further advanced, and now offered a {{continuously}} variable transmission when in fully automatic mode, or a six-speed <b>clutchless</b> manual if the driver wished to control the up- and down-shift points. A further innovation for Mitsubishi was the introduction of paddle shifters allowing the driver to make manual gearchanges while their hands remain on the steering wheel.|$|E
50|$|Citroën {{produced}} {{a number of}} variants on semi-automatic transmission. The Citroën DS, introduced in 1955, used a hydraulic system to select gears and operate the conventional clutch using hydraulic servos. There was also a speed controller and idle speed step-up device, all hydraulically operated. This allowed <b>clutchless</b> shifting with a single selector mounted behind the steering wheel. This system was nicknamed 'Citro-Matic' in the U.S.|$|E
50|$|The Juno M80/M85 was a {{different}} approach, introduced in November 1961. Unlike the K-series, there is no upper windscreen, the engine is an exposed horizontal-twin rather than an enclosed fan-cooled unit, and the body construction is conventional monocoque steel rather than FRP panels over tube. The M80/M85 also introduced a <b>clutchless</b> Badalini-type hydraulic-mechanical transmission which would {{provide the basis for}} the later Hondamatic motorcycle transmissions.|$|E
5000|$|A tail-finned (with {{optional}} two-tone paint schemes) {{version of}} the Ten, the Standard Pennant was launched in October 1957. Engine power was increased to 37 bhp and an overdrive gearbox was offered as an option. other options included a radio, heater, leather upholstery and <b>clutchless</b> 2-pedal control. Indian-produced Pennants were branded as [...] "Standard 10", and lacked any bootlid trim other than the branding.|$|E
5000|$|The Fiat Idea {{engines are}} all Euro 4 compliant. The petrol engine is the 1.4-litre 16 valve , {{available}} with five- and six-speed gearboxes, and the diesel 1.3-litre 16 valve MultiJet units, with [...] or [...] All of these engines can be matched with a <b>clutchless</b> 5-speed sequential manual shift with a selectable, fully automatic mode [...] - [...] as robotised manual gearbox marketed as Duologic.|$|E
5000|$|There are two {{versions}} of the Be Bop; a sport oriented MPV with a 2.0-litre four-cylinder turbocharged engine producing [...] and front wheel drive and a SUV version with a smaller 1.6-litre four-cylinder engine producing [...] from the Renault Megane with a new six-speed <b>clutchless</b> manual gearbox and an electronic coupling system linking the front and rear wheels. The two variations share 50% of their body components.|$|E
50|$|Beechey {{took the}} lead {{at the start of}} the race ahead of Geoghegan, with Jim McKeown moving into third from sixth place on the grid. Bob Jane's Mustang became jammed in top gear on lap 2, forcing him to retire. Beechey set a new lap record of 1:04.3 as he {{continued}} to build his lead, despite a minor clutch problem which meant that he had to make <b>clutchless</b> shifts.|$|E
5000|$|From model years 1999 to 2002, the rear-wheel-drive S-Type was {{equipped}} with either a five-speed manual (Getrag 221) or a five-speed J-Gate Ford 5R55N transmission [...] From 2003, the S-Type was produced with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a six-speed J-Gate transmission that allows automatic gear selection or <b>clutchless</b> manual gear selection. The 2004 diesel saw {{the introduction of a}} 6-speed manual transmission; it was also available with the six-speed J-Gate automatic transmission.|$|E
50|$|Depending on the implementation, some {{computer-controlled}} electrohydraulic manual transmissions {{will automatically}} shift gears {{at the right}} points (like an automatic transmission), while others require the driver to manually select the gear even when the engine is at the redline. Despite superficial similarity, <b>clutchless</b> manual transmission differ significantly in internal operation and driver's 'feel' from manumatics, the latter of which is an automatic transmission (automatics use a torque converter instead of clutch to manage {{the link between the}} engine and the transmission) with ability to signal shifts manually.|$|E
50|$|Design of the P.531 {{was started}} in November 1957 as a private venture {{improvement}} of the company's earlier Skeeter. The first prototypes were powered by a derated 325 shp Blackburn Turbomeca Turmo 600, a free turbine engine allowing <b>clutchless</b> transmission. The P.531 first flew on 20 July 1958. Three more developed P.531-0s followed and these were delivered to the Royal Navy/Fleet Air Arm for trials and familiarisation. Following evaluation by the Navy a batch of 30 developed aircraft were eventually ordered as the Westland Wasp.|$|E
5000|$|At launch, the Seicento was {{available}} with three trim levels; a basic 'S' with black bumpers and spartan equipment and initially the 899 cc 39 PS FIAT 100 series engine; an 'SX' model, a slight upgrade over the 'S' with colour-coded bumpers, electric windows, central locking and a sunroof - {{which was also}} available as a 'Citymatic' with a <b>clutchless</b> manual gearchange - and a 'Sporting' with the larger FIAT FIRE series 1,108 cc 55 PS engine, 20 mm lower suspension and anti-roll bars added.|$|E
5000|$|The {{new version}} of the Twelve used a four-cylinder 1440 cc side valve engine, {{essentially}} an enlarged version of that fitted to the 1931 Singer Ten. Drive was to the rear axle via a four-speed transmission. Braking was at first by a mechanical system replaced by hydraulics in 1934. It could be had in Saloon, Saloon de-luxe or coupe de luxe versions. The de-luxe option gave the owner all round safety glass, leather upholstery and bumpers. In 1934 the de-luxe also mfeatured <b>clutchless</b> gear changing.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1941 {{brochure}} for Chrysler automobiles, {{a silhouette}} of the car's drivetrain was depicted against {{an outline of}} the car body, with the astonishing caption of an arrow pointing to the transmission: [...] "Miracle Happens Here"! The transmission shown was an early variant (M4 [...] "Vacamatic") of the later M6 transmission and was marketed {{to compete with the}} new Oldsmobile fully automatic, <b>clutchless</b> Hydramatic transmission, introduced in the fall of 1939 on 1940 Model year Oldsmobiles. The Hydramatic was embraced enthusiastically by consumers, and was installed in 45% of 1941 Model Oldsmobiles.|$|E
5000|$|The hill-start assist is {{a variant}} of hill-holder used by some semi-automatic, <b>clutchless</b> {{transmissions}} as well as newer manual transmissions. The system prevents the car from rolling away when trying to pull away on an up or down gradient, simulating a [...] "handbrake hill start" [...] manual drivers will be familiar with. The system engages automatically when a gradient of 3% or more is detected; it then acts to hold the car stationary for two seconds after the brake is released giving the driver time to apply the throttle.|$|E
5000|$|The {{sequential}} shifting three speed gearbox was manually shifted, but <b>clutchless,</b> {{without the}} need for a clutch lever control, using instead a centrifugal clutch along with a plate clutch slaved to the footchange lever to engage and disengage the gearbox from the engine.

50|$|On 4 September 2006, AutoWired {{reported}} that engineer Gordon Murray, {{who created the}} McLaren F1, was to lead the Project Kimber engineering team. Also joining was John Piper, formerly of the Williams Formula One team who recently worked on the JCB Dieselmax car which in August 2006 set a new diesel land speed record. The revised car was to use a 1.0 litre, three-cylinder Mitsubishi Motors engine in both normally aspirated (71bhp) and turbocharged (84bhp) forms as used in the Mitsubishi i. Also the original Smart <b>clutchless</b> transmission was {{to be replaced by}} a Getrag-supplied manual gearbox.|$|E

5000|$|Despite sharing {{its name}} with the {{previous}} system, the second version of INVECS was a radical development, based on Porsche's Tiptronic semi-automatic transmission technology. As with Porsche's version it allowed for either a fully automatic mode, or a <b>clutchless</b> semi-automatic mode if the driver wished to control the up- and down-shift points. It also offered the same Adaptive Shift Control software which monitored and [...] "learned" [...] the driver's habits over time and adjusted the smoothness or aggression of the gearshifts to suit his or her driving style. It was first implemented in the new Mitsubishi FTO in 1994.|$|E
5000|$|The 2C was {{the next}} car with the {{innovative}} in-car adjustable rear wing. The integrated spoiler-wing was designed to lie flat for low drag on the straights and tip up under braking through the corners. This was a direct benefit of the <b>clutchless</b> semi-automatic transmission which kept the driver's left foot free to operate the wing mechanism. The 2C {{was based on a}} Chevrolet designed aluminum chassis and was a smaller car in every dimension than the 2B. Without the natural non-resonant damping of the fiberglass chassis, Hall nicknamed it the EBJ — [...] "eye ball jiggler".|$|E
5000|$|The Cony Guppy {{is a small}} {{pickup truck}} {{manufactured}} by Aichi. The vehicle had suicide doors and siren-like lights on the B-pillar. The brake lights were tiny and circular.The engine, which rests behind the seats is a 2 valve 199 cc single cylinder that produces 11 horsepower, which can power the vehicle to its top speed of 50 mph. Aichi rated the Guppy's fuel economy at 50 km/l.They also claimed the Guppy is able to carry 100 kilograms of cargo. Its low price of ¥225,000 made it attractive to small business owners and cargo transporters. Other features include a 4-wheel independent suspension and a torque converter for <b>clutchless</b> driving.|$|E
5000|$|Teddy Carroll (born 1894) {{was one of}} the {{original}} factory test riders for the Indian Motocycle company {{and a member of the}} first generation of boys who had [...] "caught the fever" [...] to race a motorized bicycle. Born in Springfield, Massachusetts, Carroll was practically raised in the backyard of the giant Hendee Mfg. Co. factory. At twelve, Teddy rode his first [...] "gasoline-fired" [...] two-wheeler and mastered the [...] "run, push, and jump-on style" [...] necessary to get the <b>clutchless</b> cycles underway. As a biographer later recalled: [...] "Many a tumble he took in the dust, but more than anything else, Teddy was determined to ride." ...|$|E
5000|$|The R/T {{model has}} a 2.4 L [...] {{version of the}} World engine, {{equipped}} with the CVT2 transmission, and programmed with an 'AutoStick' feature giving six simulated fixed ratios in a <b>clutchless</b> manual mode {{in addition to the}} standard CVT 'Drive' mode. All-wheel-drive was an option on the R/T model until 2009, but with automatic transmission only. Eighteen-inch aluminum wheels were standard, while chromed versions were optional. At launch, the CVT2 with all-wheel drive was the only powertrain combination available for the R/T. A front-wheel drive variant with the T355 5-speed manual transmission commenced production in late summer 2006. ABS was standard, and the suspension and steering systems were tuned for performance.|$|E
5000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous of all Tempests were the 12 1963 [...] "Super Duty" [...] cars built to compete in the NHRA Factory Experimental class. [...] These were put {{together}} at the Pontiac plant in Michigan over Christmas 1962 with the knowledge of the impending General Motors ban on factory racing. Among those who successfully raced them was Wild Bill Shrewsberry, who turned low 12-second quarter-miles in the 1963 NHRA Winternationals driving for Mickey Thompson. Shrewsberry still owns his car and it is still equipped with Pontiac's [...] "Powershift" [...] transaxle as retrofitted later in the 1963 season. Developed specifically for the Super Duty, this was essentially two Powerglide automatics in a single four-speed unit, allowing <b>clutchless</b> shifting in much the same manner as modern drag racing transmissions.|$|E
