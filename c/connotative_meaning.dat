5000|$|Meanings between {{consumers}} and marketers depict signs and symbols that are encoded in everyday objects. Semiotics {{is the study}} of signs and how they are interpreted. Advertising has many hidden signs and meanings within brand names, logos, package designs, print advertisements, and television advertisements. Semiotics aims to study and interpret the message being conveyed in (for example) advertisements. Logos and advertisements can be interpreted at two levels - known as the surface level and the underlying level. The surface level uses signs creatively to create an image or personality for a product. These signs can be images, words, fonts, colors, or slogans. The underlying level is made up of hidden meanings. The combination of images, words, colors, and slogans must be interpreted by the audience or consumer. The [...] "key to advertising analysis" [...] is the signifier and the signified. The signifier is the object and the signified is the mental concept. A product has a signifier and a signified. The signifier is the color, brand name, logo design, and technology. The signified has two meanings known as denotative and connotative. The denotative meaning is the meaning of the product. A television's denotative meaning might be that it is high definition. The <b>connotative</b> <b>meaning</b> is the product's deep and hidden meaning. A <b>connotative</b> <b>meaning</b> of a television would be that it is top-of-the-line.|$|E

The community will identify a lexical thing that needs to be referred to in their language. By common agreement, a sign (sometimes called a signal) will be selected. Of the many possible shades of meanings that {{it can be used to}} convey, one or more will be selected and encoded, i.e. the chosen meaning(s) will be denoted or associated with the sign within the broader framework of syntactic and semantic systems available within the community. When the audience is exposed to the sign, the expectation is that they will be able to decode the meaning. As Roman Jakobson adds, there will also be an emotional element or value which represents the addresser's attitude towards the thing. This will either become a <b>connotative</b> <b>meaning</b> attached directly to the sign itself, or it will be communicated by the context in which the sign is used by the addresser.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{semiotic}} {{analysts have}} examined music videos to decode messages {{that are being}} sent to viewers. Invisible editing, a semiotic term, that film editors use to almost decode the message for the audience using narrative actions. Daniel Chandler's example from famous film editor, Ralph Rosenblum, [...] "a man awakens suddenly {{in the middle of}} the night, bolts up in bed, stares ahead intensely, and twitches his nose. Then the film directs towards a room where two people are desperately fighting a billowing blaze"(Chandler, pp. 166, 2007). Because of the actions of the actors, the audience is aware of the next scene before it is shown. An example of invisible editing in music videos would be in narrative style, which consist of a plot and storyline of events and characters Michael Jackson's music video, Thriller is considered a narrative script, and it exceeds the song itself. In this case, the context of visual narrative semantically over-powers the meaning of the song itself. Many music videos use narrative style script, which is considered a more formal approach as the editing will add emphasis to the song's chorus, giving it a deeply ingrained musical archetype. Music videos that aren't formally organized usually have no segmentation markings that flow with the lyrics, and contain abstract images. Sledgehammer, by Peter Gabriel is an example of formally unorganized music videos. In general, music videos contain visuals that either represent the potential <b>connotative</b> <b>meaning</b> of the lyrics or the visuals can represent a semiotic system of its own. Although many analysts explain the music video as being a narrative structure, there are many videos that defy narrative conventions.|$|E

This code or position {{is one where}} the consumer takes the actual meaning directly, and decodes it exactly {{the way it was}} encoded. For instance, political and military elites primarily generated the politics of Northern Ireland and the Chilean Coup. These elites created the [...] "hegemonic interpretations" [...] Because these ideas were hegemonic interpretations, they became dominant. Hall demonstrates that if a viewer of a newscast on such topics decoded the message [...] "in terms of the reference code in which it has been encoded" [...] that the viewer would be [...] "operating inside the dominant code" [...] Thus, the dominant code involves taking the <b>connotative</b> <b>meaning</b> of a message in the exact way a sender intended a message to be interpreted (decoded). Under this framework, the consumer is located within the dominant point of view, and is fully sharing the texts codes and accepts and reproduces the intended meaning. Here, there is barely any misunderstanding because both the sender and receiver have the same cultural biases. [...] This means that the intended message was created by the dominant class and that the recipient was also a part of the dominant point of view. [...] A modern-day example of the dominant-hegemonic code is described by communication scholar Garrett Castleberry in his upcoming article [...] "Understanding Stuart Hall's 'Encoding/Decoding' Through AMC's Breaking Bad". Castleberry argues that there is a dominant-hegemonic [...] "position held by the entertainment industry that illegal drug side-effects cause less damage than perceived". If this is the dominant code and television shows like Breaking Bad support such perceptions, then they are operating within the dominant code Likewise, a viewer believing such perceptions will also be operating within the dominant-hegemonic code since they are encoding the message in the way it is intended.|$|E

40|$|Affective imagery, or <b>connotative</b> <b>meanings,</b> play an {{important}} role in shaping public risk perceptions, policy support, and broader responses to climate change. These simple “topof-mind” associations and their related affect help reveal how diverse audiences understand and interpret global warming. And as a relatively simple set of measures, they are easily incorporated into representative surveys, making it possible to identify, measure, and monitor how <b>connotative</b> <b>meanings</b> are distributed throughout a population and how they change over time. Affective image analysis can help identify distinct interpretive communities of like-minded individuals who share their own set of common meanings and interpretations. The images also provide a highly sensitive measure of changes in public discourse. As scientists, political elites, advocates, and the media change the frames, images, icons, and emotions they use to communicate climate change, they can influence the interpretations of the larger public. Likewise, as members of the public directly or vicariously experience specific events or learn more about climate risks, they construct their own <b>connotative</b> <b>meanings,</b> which can in turn influence larger currents of public discourse.

Its novelty is defined {{by the fact that the}} author analyses the new type of discourse - psychotherapeutic one.

Due to the subjective character of the discourse the psychotherapist tries different tactics and techniques. Such a feature of this type of communication is defined as ‘blind tactic’ or ‘empirical wandering’. Strategies used by the clients are also described, the retrospective strategy being in focus.

40|$|This {{experimental}} study investigates the <b>connotative</b> <b>meaning</b> {{of the concept}} “cash”, {{as it relates to}} the cash flow statement, held by the three key parties to the accounting communication process: preparers, auditors and users. Concerns raised in the accounting profession regarding the susceptibility of the cash flow statement to manipulation, coupled with the recent introduction of NZ IAS 7 (cash flow statement) provide the motivation for investigating the potential for miscommunication (either intentional or unintentional) between the main parties to the financial reporting process. The study investigates inter and intra group differences in measured <b>connotative</b> <b>meaning</b> of the old and new definitions of “cash”, and determines the effect of <b>connotative</b> <b>meaning</b> on decision outcomes. Further, the study considers the overall quality of the two definitions, as perceived by the three financial reporting groups. Three key findings are indicated. The first is that the three financial reporting groups do not share the same cognitive structure in which the meaning of the concept “cash” is held. An important implication is that comparisons between the connotative meanings held by the three financial reporting groups cannot be validly made. Secondly, significant differences in the measured meaning were observed across the two definitions within each of the three subject groups. Thirdly, the decision outcomes for each of the three subject groups were significantly different under the two definitions. Also there was some evidence that the differences in the decision outcomes were linked to the differences in the measured <b>connotative</b> <b>meaning.</b> These results raised several concerns regarding the potential for miscommunication between the three key parties to the accounting communication process and highlighted the importance of standard-setters assessing the effect on <b>connotative</b> <b>meaning</b> of possible changes in wording to key concepts within the cash flow statement...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the impact on {{communication}} of changes in an accounting standard arising from the transition to International Financial Reporting Standards. It investigates inter and intragroup differences in measured <b>connotative</b> <b>meaning</b> of the old and new definitions of “cash”, as held by three key groups of parties to the accounting communication process (preparers, auditors and users); and determines the effect of changes in <b>connotative</b> <b>meaning</b> on decision behaviour (outcomes). Design/methodology/approach – The study adopted a between-participants 2 × 3 factorial design whereby the first factor reflected the definition type: old vs new definition of the concept “cash”; while the second reflected three financial reporting groups: preparers, auditors and users. The semantic differential technique developed by Osgood, Suci and Tannenbaum was used to measure <b>connotative</b> <b>meaning.</b> Findings – The study finds that the three financial reporting groups do not share the same meaning of the concept “cash” and that the introduction of the new definition has changed the interpreted <b>connotative</b> <b>meaning</b> for these three groups. A link between measured meaning and the decisions made by the participants was also established. Research limitations/implications – The explanatory power of the typical three (evaluative, potency and activity) factor structure should be acknowledged; these factors typically explain 50 per cent of the total phenomena known as “meaning”. The study's findings make an important contribution to the earnings management and creative accounting literature. Practical implications – The findings are particularly relevant to standard-setters and regulators as a lack of shared meaning may lead to unnecessary misunderstandings and tensions among the many parties to the reporting process. Originality/value – The study extends prior measurement of meaning studies in accounting through first, the inclusion of all three major groups of parties to the accounting communication process; second, examination of an accounting concept which is defined differently by two accounting standards in the same jurisdiction; and last, investigation of the impact on decision behaviour (outcomes) resulting from changes in meaning brought about through the introduction of a new standard across the three groups.
