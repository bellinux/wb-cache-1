50|$|Almost all of Hepworth's {{feature film}} {{output of the}} 1910s and early 1920s has for many decades been assumed to be lost forever, but {{searches}} and appeals to <b>cinema</b> <b>archive</b> facilities and private collectors worldwide continue to be made, notably by the British Film Institute National Archive. In the case of Helen of Four Gates, this finally bore fruit in 2007 when an original print {{was found in the}} vaults of the Cinémathèque québécoise in Montreal. A clip and a panorama of stills were shown to an audience in Hebden Bridge in August 2008, the first known public screening of any of the material since the 1920s. The first showing of the entire film took place in June 2010, again in Hebden Bridge, followed by a screening by the BFI in London in August 2010. The print is now held in the BFI National Archive.|$|E
5000|$|Her newfound celebrity {{helped launch}} {{her career in}} the nascent film {{industry}} and she starred in four silent films. In the first, Inspiration (1915), {{the story of a}} sculptor's model, she appeared fully nude, the first woman to do so in an American motion picture. The censors were reluctant to ban the film, fearing they would also have to ban Renaissance art. Munson's films were a box office success, although the critics were divided. The studio hired a lookalike named Jane Thomas to do Munson's acting scenes, while Munson did the scenes where she posed nude. Her second film, Purity (1916), made in Santa Barbara, California, {{is the only one of}} her films to survive, being rediscovered in 1993 in a [...] "pornography" [...] collection in France and acquired by the French national <b>cinema</b> <b>archive.</b> Her third film, The Girl o' Dreams, also made in Santa Barbara, was completed by the fall of 1916 and was copyrighted on December 31, 1918, but appears never to have been released.|$|E
50|$|Karađorđe {{was last}} {{recorded}} as being screened {{to a group}} of Serbian immigrants in the United States in 1928. A copy of the film existed in Belgrade until 1947-1948, when it was destroyed after its owner tossed it into the Danube to avoid being persecuted by Yugoslavia's new Communist authorities following the Karađorđević dynasty's exile in the aftermath of World War II. After many decades of being considered lost, it was rediscovered in the Austrian Film Archives in Vienna on 16 July 2003 by Aleksandar Erdeljanović and Radoslav Zelenović on behalf of the Yugoslav <b>Cinema</b> <b>Archive</b> (Jugoslovenska kinoteka). Erdeljanović and Zelenović went on to spend more than 3,000 hours attempting to re-master the film, whose quality had been significantly degraded due to the damp conditions in which it was kept. Even then the film was not discovered in its entirety as the original was more than 1800 m in length while the version that Erdeljanović and Zelenović discovered was significantly shorter. Erdeljanović has said that he and Zelenović managed to preserve an estimated eighty to ninety percent of the film during their restoration. Once the pair had completed their work, the film, now with a reduced length of 62 minutes, was broadcast on Serbian television after many decades of being considered lost.|$|E
