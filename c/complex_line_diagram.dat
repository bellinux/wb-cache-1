Their <b>line</b> <b>diagrams</b> should re ect the semantical relationships within the data. Up to now, no satisfactory automatic drawing programs for this task exist. The geometrical heuristic is the most successful tool for drawing concept lattices manually. It uses a geometric representation as intermediate step between the list of upper covers and the <b>line</b> <b>diagram</b> of the lattice. ...|$|R

Thus, one can build up the concept lattice one concept at a time, by finding the neighbors in the <b>line</b> <b>diagram</b> of known concepts, starting from the concept with an empty set of objects.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} demand for data {{transmission}} over digital networks involving mobile terminals. An important class of data required for transmission over mobile terminals is image information such as street maps, floor plans and identikit images. This sort of transmission {{is of particular interest}} to the service industries such as the Police force, Fire brigade, medical services and other services. These services cannot be applied directly to mobile terminals because of the limited capacity of the mobile channels and the transmission errors caused by the multipath (Rayleigh) fading. In this research, transmission of <b>line</b> <b>diagram</b> images such as floor plans and street maps, over digital networks involving mobile terminals at transmission rates of 2400 bits/s and 4800 bits/s have been studied. A low bit-rate source encoding technique using geometric codes is found to be suitable to represent <b>line</b> <b>diagram</b> images. In geometric encoding, the amount of data required to represent or store the <b>line</b> <b>diagram</b> images is proportional to the image detail. Thus a simple <b>line</b> <b>diagram</b> image would require a small amount of data. To study the effect of transmission errors due to mobile channels on the transmitted images, error sources (error files), which represent mobile channels under different conditions, have been produced using channel modelling techniques. Satisfactory models of the mobile channel have been obtained when compared to the field test measurements. Subjective performance tests have been carried out to evaluate the quality and usefulness of the received <b>line</b> <b>diagram</b> images under various mobile channel conditions. The effect of mobile transmission errors {{on the quality of the}} received images has been determined. To improve the quality of the received images under various mobile channel conditions, forward error correcting codes (FEC) with interleaving and automatic repeat request (ARQ) schemes have been proposed. The performance of the error control codes have been evaluated under various mobile channel conditions. It has been shown that a FEC code with interleaving can be used effectively to improve the quality of the received images under normal and severe mobile channel conditions. Under normal channel conditions, similar results have been obtained when using ARQ schemes. However, under severe mobile channel conditions, the FEC code with interleaving shows better performance...|$|R

We discuss a method to avoid unwanted incidences when working with additive <b>diagrams.</b> 1 Additive <b>line</b> <b>diagrams</b> By a <b>line</b> <b>diagram</b> we mean a graph diagram of the simplest kind, with small circles representing the vertices and with line segments for the edges. To draw such a diagram (in the plane P) we need as input a graph (V; E) and a placement function pos : V ! P; that associates coordinates to each vertex. An additive representation of such a placement map pos consists of a set D, a map rep : V ! P(D), and a map vec : D ! P with pos(v) = X d 2 rep(v) vec(d) : A <b>line</b> <b>diagram</b> with a given additive representation is called an additive <b>line</b> <b>diagram</b> [2]. Every placement function has an additive representation, with D := V, rep(v) := fvg and vec(v) := pos(v) for all v 2 V. So, in a sense, every diagram is additive. But much more interesting additive representations are those where D is small compared to V. An example will be given in Figure 2. When an additive diagram is to be modi ed, a natural strategy {{is to keep the}} rep function xed and to manipulate only the vec mapping. If only a single value, say vec(d), is changed by adding a vector a, then the diagram changes as follows: all vertices v with d 2 rep(v) are shifted by a, all other vertices remain xed, see Figure 1. 2 Order diagrams Ordered sets, lattices (i. e., ordered sets with in ma and suprema), and more generally directed acyclic digraphs can be represented by drawings" (also called Hasse diagrams), where the direction of an edge is indicated by an increasing y-coordinate.
