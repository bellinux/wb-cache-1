40|$|Abstract – The {{reaction}} mechanisms occurring when MgO-MgR 2 O 3 refractories {{are exposed}} to SO 2 -containing gas atmospheres were examined. The study examined the characteristic structures of magnesite-chrome, <b>chrome-magnesite</b> and magnesite refractories exposed to SO 2 -O 2 gas mixture at temperatures of 700 °C to 1350 °C. The phase characterization was conducted with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and powder X-ray diffractometry (XRD). The {{results show that the}} physical characteristics of the refractory matrix along the grain boundaries are important refractory features during chemical attack from SO 2 -containing gas. Upon heating in SO 2 -containing gas, the changes in phase-chemical compositions and accompanying grain growth causes loosening of the structure and the pore volume promotes gas diffusion. The chemical reactions that occur form stable sulfate compounds identified as MgSO 4, CaSO 4 and CaMg 3 (SO 4) 4, and lead to disintegration of various phase structures and consequently erosion of the refractory. In conclusion, the reaction mechanisms in MgO-MgR 2 O 3 refractories exposed to SO 2 -containing gases progress through a combination of structural disintegration and chemical attack...|$|E
40|$|The {{fundamental}} reaction mechanisms, when unused <b>chrome-magnesite,</b> magnesite-chrome and magnesite refractories {{are exposed}} to sulfur-bearing gas mixtures of SO 2 -O 2, SO 2 -N 2 and SO 2 at 700 °C to 1350 °C, were investigated. The investigations comprised chemical analyses, thermodynamic analyses and microstructural examination. The extent of the conversion reactions was measured {{as a function of}} temperature and reaction time. Six basic refractories were investigated and characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) methods. The microstructural examination indicated that physical changes in the original microstructure of the refractory could possibly influence the reactions with sulfur-bearing gases and the chemical analyses of the product phases confirmed the formation of secondary sulfates within pores, along grain boundaries and cracks. The structural features in the original refractory were determined by technological processes employed during original firing in production. The factors attributed to the principal physical changes of the original microstructure were related to the diffusion processes, which affected the phase distribution, pore size distribution and grain size. The fundamental reactions involved in the pore size distribution and microstructure were attributed to the differential diffusion mechanism of individual components that resulted in the development of magnesia spinels. The effects on the microstructure demonstrated that the reactions were limited to the grain boundary region due to the product layer formed as the reactions progressed. The chemical product analyses indicated that in the sulfates formed, the sulfation reactions were significantly affected by the equilibrium thermodynamics of the oxygen and sulfur dioxide gas combination in the products of 1 / 2 SO 2 O 2 P P. The phase changes led to the dissolution of the refractory components and crystallization of MgO and CaO. This influenced the permeability of the sulfur-bearing gases that reacted to form MgSO 4 and CaSO 4 found as grain boundary and pore space fillings. Resistance to sulfur-bearing gas infiltration and sulfation in fine-grained direct bonded refractories were found to be better than that of the coarse-grained direct bonded refractories. The decreased sulfation of the fine-grained refractory was related to the restricted diffusion processes due to the stable magnesia spinel phases and retention of the closed pore structure at different temperatures. However, the dissolution and crystallization mechanism described in sulfation, demonstrated that MgSO 4, CaSO 4, CaMg 3 (SO 4) 3 and compound mixtures of sulfate, silica, magnesia and sesquioxides (Fe 2 O 3, Al 2 O 3 and Cr 2 O 3) were formed along the grain boundaries...|$|E
40|$|During the {{refining}} {{of steel}} by basic processes, {{a multitude of}} mineralogical reactions {{take place in the}} refractories with which the furnace is lined. The reactions are caused by an influx of material from the slag and are a function of the composition of the slag and of the refractory. The flow of material from the slag into the refractory resembles the process of metasomatism encountered in nature. The reactions between slags of different composition and magnesiteand chromite-containing refractories could be studied systematically {{as a result of a}} series of four experiments. During each of the experiments four different refractories were subjected to the influence of a slag having a specific composition for a considerable length of time. The experiments were conducted in a rotating furnace at 1700 ° 0 ~ Mineralogical reactions in the refractories used in these experiments can be divided into two main categories, viz. reactions involving the oxides and reactions involving the silicates. The relevant oxides are periclase, the sesquioxides and spinel. Periclase is found to Mndergo reactions like grain growth, resorption and elongation normal to the hot face of the refractory. These reactions are dependent on the composition of the refractory and of the metasomatised components. Reaction between periclase and sesquioxides yield spinel, provided there is no excess of lime. Exsolution of bodies of spinel from periclase is governed by the crystal-chemistry of both minerals. At elevated temperature, spinel, and more specifically chromite, acts as a source of sesquioxides in general, and of ferric oxide in particular. The stability of chromite depends on the molecular ratio between lime and silica of both the refractory and the slag. This ratio determines the amount of sesquioxides present, but not in spinel or in periclase, i. e. in the matrix of the refractory. The postulation of the reactions involving the silicates is possible because of the tendency of the refractory to reach equilibrium with the composition of the slag. The silicates present in acid slags are not in equilibrium with magnesia in the refractory, and consequent reaction yields the minerals monticellite and merwinite. These minerals are not in equilibrium with the bonding silicates of magnesite refractories which have high molecular lime/silica ratios and also not with the bonding silicates of chromite- containing refractories having ver. y low molecular lime/silica ratios. Reaction between metasomatic and autochthonous silicates result in a new set of silicates. The silicates present in basic slags are in equilibrium with magnesia of the refractories as well as with the bonding silicates of magnesite refractories having high molecular lime/silica ratios. Consequently, no reaction results. Reaction does, however, take place between the silicates supplied by basic slags and the bonding silicates of chromite- containing refractories. Ultrabasic slags react mildly with magnesite and drastically with <b>chrome-magnesite</b> bricks. The reason is that in the former reaction, only monticellite and merwinite are not in equilibrium with the composition of the melt, but these minerals have a relatively high mobility, and migrate de~per into the refractory. In chromite-containing refractories, however, neither of the minerals chromite, monticellite or forsterite are in equilibrium with the composition of the slag. Reaction results in the formation of an association of minerals in the area of contact between the slag and the refractory which differs completely from the original minerals of the refractory. The conclusion arrived at is that chromite has a beneficial influence on refractories used in contact with less basic slags, because of the textural superiority of chromite-containing refractories over magnesite refractories. In contact with basic slags, however, metasomatism leads to the formation of components which have low melting points and low viscosities. During the refining of steel by basic processes, ultrabasic slags are preferred and magnesite refractories having high molecular lime/silica ratios are better suited for use in contact with the liquid slag.
