40|$|The {{benefits}} <b>of</b> <b>cross-compliance</b> can be maximised only {{by taking}} into account the trade-off between economic costs due to cross-compliance prescriptions and environmental benefits produced. Both can, however, be strongly differentiated between different areas/farms. In addition, the effects <b>of</b> <b>cross-compliance</b> are conditioned by the ability to design appropriate incentives to compliance for farmers. The objective {{of this paper is to}} develop a framework for the analysis <b>of</b> <b>cross-compliance</b> under asymmetric information when the differentiation of the compliance cost function is explicitly taken into account. This is accomplished by the development from the public regulator of a mathematical model <b>of</b> optimal <b>cross-compliance</b> design under asymmetric information about compliance. The methodology is applied to a case study represented by the municipality of Argenta in Emilia-Romagna Region (Italy). Empirical insights show the potential loss of net social benefits from cross-compliance when undifferentiated policies are implemented in cases with relevant differences in the value of costs of compliance. The analysis demonstrates that when the net social benefits of prescription have differentiated values, optimal policy design requires a differentiation of prescriptions and monitoring intensity. This is primarily addressed in this paper through the consideration of differentiated compliance costs. However, the same would apply to provide appropriate incentives to farmers, {{taking into account}} differentiated environmental benefits produced and Single Farm Payment endowments...|$|R

30|$|Pillar I and II {{policies}} show opposing {{impacts on}} the HNV farmland indicator. Even with the introduction <b>of</b> <b>cross-compliance</b> rules, the amount of SFP received per municipality has {{a negative effect on}} the HNV indicator. Our results confirm expectations and previous findings (Signorotti et al. [2013]; Reinhard and Linderhof [2013]) regarding the positive effects of agri-environmental schemes in promoting the HNV farmland indicator. Despite this, our results highlight that only organic farming positively contributes to the HNV farmland value.|$|R
30|$|Generally, {{many studies}} have shown that low-intensive {{agriculture}} is the main source of environmental quality (Foley et al. [2005]; Caballero and Gil, [2009]) {{and at the same time}} is the most vulnerable farming system (Caballero et al., [2008]). Thus a set of agricultural policy instruments has been implemented to maintain low-intensive farming and to encourage the shift towards less impacting systems. Policy instruments belonging to both CAP pillars have thus been implemented, consisting mainly <b>of</b> <b>cross-compliance</b> measures and agri-environmental schemes.|$|R
40|$|Cross-compliance {{has proven}} its effectiveness, {{as can be}} shown {{by looking at the}} Swiss {{experience}} with cross-compliance since 1999. Besides describing the existing cross-compliance practices in Switzerland, the paper shows different perspectives on the efficiency and fairness <b>of</b> <b>cross-compliance.</b> It concludes that transaction cost advantages justify cross-compliance only in few cases. Usually, it will be more efficient to decouple social and environmental policy. The strong support for cross-compliance by the Swiss population is explained by a perceived unfairness in the distribution of property rights between farmers and society. If property rights would be redistributed, there probably would be no more need for cross-compliance. Agricultural policy, Tinbergen rule, transaction costs...|$|R

30|$|The second {{category}} contains policy variables, belonging to both CAP pillar I and II. The data used {{were obtained by}} aggregating payments received since 2003 under the single payments scheme and from the two RDP programs, namely RDP 2000 - 2006 and RDP 2007 - 2013, by the farms located in each municipality. Policy has {{a prominent role in}} promoting the provision of HNV farmland (Signorotti et al. [2013]; Reinhard and Linderhof [2013]). The first pillar policy can negatively affect the HNV farmland score due to maintenance support and the introduction of commodity crops.

40|$|The {{concept of}} Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC) was {{introduced}} by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform in 2003 within the framework <b>of</b> <b>cross-compliance</b> and implemented by the Member States since 2005.

Following the first observed positive feedbacks obtained via the wide spread enforcement of environmental practices though the first CAP pillar, more and more emphasis is given to cross-compliance, and especially its GAEC component. This paper describes major approaches used in the different Member States in defining minimum requirements for GAEC standards and then discusses main issues and perspectives for a more effective and valuable implementation in the future.

In general, the term ecological awareness encompasses all the ideas, values and opinions about the natural environment as a place where man lives and works. An assessment of the level of farmers’ knowledge about the sustainable development indicates that it is still insufficient. The studies show that farmers have reciprocally contradictory attitudes including, on the one hand, the attitudes indicating high ecological awareness, even if they are declarative in character, and, on the other hand, the opinions revealing lack of knowledge about the environment-man relationships.

We will present both the historical background of the formation of Cumanian mounds, and their relationship with human society in the past centuries. They were of administrative, religious and burial importance in the early centuries. From botanical aspect they are valuable as landscape elements at present because of the specific way they were formed. Unfortunately, the different agricultural activities resulted in their continuous deterioration and their number also decreased over the past centuries. There were remarkable changes in agricultural regulation concerning Cumanian mounds in the EU – and in Hungary too – in 2010.

The maintenance of natural pastures, within the framework of a control program (Italian GAEC standard 4. 1 a of cross compliance), represents a relevant action for a correct ecosystem management in order to preserve the floristic richness and, as a consequence, habitat biodiversity; it can also transform the pastures into a permanent feed resource not only for domestic livestock, but also for wild fauna. When the grazing activity is managed with rational criteria can be vital to preserve biodiversity, allowing the maintenance of those habitats in danger of disappearance. The aim of grazing management should be the preservation of habitat and biodiversity.

40|$|Developing {{and using}} the concept of 'cross compliance' this report {{provides}} {{an examination of the}} primary and secondary effects <b>of</b> agri-environmental policies. <b>Cross-compliance</b> is applied to a number of agri-environmental policies; CAP reform, the 'accompanying measures' of CAP reform and a selection of member state agri-environmental policies. The development of the concept of cross compliance provides a useful tool to perform evaluation on the effectiveness and efficiency of general policy instruments, but specifically policy scenarios designed to reduce nitrate pollution of groundwater due to agriculture and goes some way to help answer policy questions on which mechanism may achieve a wide range <b>of</b> performance criteria. <b>Cross-compliance</b> can be applied at different levels of the policy and can be used to categorise policies into a number of sets according to specified criteria. CAP reform policies designed to control supply, although having positive environmental effects, are not as successful at achieving environmental objectives in comparison to the 'accompanying measures' elements of CAP reform. However a number of the policies from the accompanying measures package, for example the protection of rare breeds and the shelter planting, have very specific and narrow aims and so do not achieve large positive cross compliance for reductions in nitrate pollution. The analysis also deals with a number of other policies, some agricultural in basis, such as the Less Favoured Areas policy, which scored highly in achieving income redistribution to the targeted group but failed in achieving positive environmental effects. A number of useful trends have been identified and these may be useful for formulating future agri-environmental policy in terms of achieving higher degrees <b>of</b> <b>cross-compliance.</b> It is recognised that this technique would be usefully expanded and that it warrants further investigation in order that a quantitative valuation of positive and negative cross-compliance could eventually be attached to each policy. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper's aim is {{to assess}} {{effectiveness}} of the implementation of nature conservation measures in Polish agriculture. Environmental regulations influence main groups of Common Agricultural Policy instruments. In the I pillar of the policy, it refers to cross-compliance, in the II pillar it refers to agri-environmental programmes, the Natura 2000 payments and organic farming support. In Poland they are ineffectively implemented and insufficiently directed to nature conservation. This refers both to domestic environmental and agricultural policy. In some aspects they are not coordinated. This is connected with delay in construction of protection plans which are necessary for proper policy in the Natura 2000 network. Consequently, the specialized payments for farmers in the Natura 2000 network have not been implemented yet while the extent in which agri-environmental measures have been implemented is too small. Moreover, the system of control and certification in organic farming does not involve requirements referring to biodiversity. There are some deficiencies in biodiversity protection standards within domestic regulations <b>of</b> <b>cross-compliance.</b> In this situation, Polish agriculture could contribute to degradation of biological diversity in rural areas...|$|R
40|$|SummaryAnimal {{welfare is}} being accorded an {{increasingly}} important role in today’s civil society. Within the EU this has been enshrined within the specific “Protocol on Protection and Welfare of Animals” of theEC Treaty, obliging Member States and the EU Institutions to pay full regard {{to the welfare of}} animals when formulating and implementing Community policies. There is a growing body of EU legislation on thisissue, founded on clear scientific principles, taking account of public concerns, stakeholder input and possible socioeconomicimplications. Recent Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reforms also testify to animal welfare’s growing stature in policy-making, with the introduction of the principle <b>of</b> <b>cross-compliance</b> regardingeligibility for direct payments and additional financial incentives for producers to achieve higher welfare standards. Animal welfare isbeing increasingly perceived as an integral element of overall food quality, having important implications for animal health andfood safety.

40|$|We analyse the {{development}} of income inequality in Swiss agriculture for the period 1990 - 2009. To this end, Gini coefficients are estimated using FADN data. Furthermore, we estimate concentration ratios and Gini elasticities for market income, direct payments and off-farm income. Our analysis is separated for the three production regions in Swiss agriculture: valley, hill and mountain regions. This study is motivated {{by the fact that}} Swiss agricultural policy reforms resulted in dramatic changes of the importance of different income sources in the here considered period. Our results show that household income inequality increased only slightly between 1990 and 2009. Furthermore, agricultural policy reforms affected the income inequality differently in the considered production regions. More specifically, the introduction of area-based direct payments in 1992 mainly affected the valley region. In contrast, the introduction <b>of</b> <b>cross-compliance</b> and abandonment <b>of</b> farm household payments in 1999 had stronger effects for farmers in the hilly and mountainous region.
