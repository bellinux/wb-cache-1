His first priority was to reduce Mexico's external debt; in mid-1989 the government reached agreement with its commercial bank creditors to reduce its medium- and long-term debt. The following year, Salinas took his next step toward higher capital inflows by lowering domestic borrowing costs, reprivatizing the banking system, and broaching the idea of a free-trade agreement with the United States.

40|$|What {{happens to}} {{domestic}} {{investment in a}} context of massive capital flight? I investigate this research question using annual panel data for the 15 African countries in the Franc Zone (FZ) in the period 1970 to 2005. The econometric analysis shows that capital flight affects negatively and significantly domestic investment, suggesting thus that capital flight lowers domestic investment in the FZ. The results indicate also that the domestic investment influence of capital flight operates through the private investment channel more than the public investment channel, and is caused by capital outflows from CEMAC more than those from WAEMU. The key implication of these results is that <b>capital</b> flight <b>repatriation</b> helps increase the level of domestic investment.

40|$|Abstract: Despite the {{substantial}} recent {{increase in capital}} flows to sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the sub-continent remains largely marginalized in financial globalization and chronically dependent on official development aid. The current debate on resource mobilization for development financing in Africa has overlooked the problem of capital flight, which constitutes an important untapped source of funds. This paper argues that repatriation of flight capital deserves more attention on economic as well as moral grounds. On the moral side, {{the argument is that}} {{a large proportion of the}} capital flight legitimately belongs to the African people and therefore must be restituted to the legitimate claimants. The economic argument is that repatriation of flight capital will contribute to propelling the sub-continent on a higher sustainable growth path while preserving its financial stability and independence and without mortgaging the welfare of its future generations through external borrowing.

40|$|The {{low income}} {{level of the}} Pakistani people is due to {{population}} density and under-utilization of resources. Industrialization will create greater job opportunities for the population and will enable fuller utilization of other kinds of resources. The shift from agricultural production to manufacturing production, in general, promises greater productivity. Moderate industrialization is possible in Pakistan because it possesses an ample volume of agricultural raw materials such as jute, cotton, sugarcane, and tobacco and sizable energy resources and mineral ores, and because the abundant labor supply can be trained with relative ease. Entry into industrialization is hindered by low income levels and a consequent low level of domestic capital formation. Foreign investment must therefore be encouraged. Examination of the investment atmosphere in Pakistan discloses certain factors that tend to retard the flow of incoming capital such as regulations limiting foreign investment to certain fields, local participation requirements, mineral development laws, certain import restrictions, Controls over security issues, and high corporation and personal taxes. On the other hand features encouraging the entry of foreign investment funds include a liberal policy on profit remittances and <b>capital</b> <b>repatriation,</b> tax relief for investors, government aids to new firms, customs exemptions on selected capital goods and raw materials imports, improved government administration, and a generally favorable attitude toward private enterprise.

40|$|This paper takes a broad {{approach}} to the analyses and implications of capital flight for economic growth and development in Africa. It {{provides an overview of}} why capital flight constrains and undermines economic growth and development in Africa because of the resource gap which it exacerbates. Capital flight undermines domestic resource mobilization effort, reduces private domestic investment, and reduces the tax base, and thus brings about reduced public investment and social services. The analysis draws on a distinction between economic growth and development. In drawing out the distinction, the analysis goes beyond economic growth and covers the deeper issues of social development (wellbeing of citizens) as measured by the Human Development Index, and economic transformation. The paper deals with the issues of poverty and inequality. In addition the paper pushes the analysis to the implications of capital flight for developmental policy. Addressed in the paper also are issues of the quality of public finance and the absorptive capacity of a country in the event of reduced capital flight / and <b>capital</b> flight <b>repatriation</b> and its implications for resource management and attainment of developmental objectives.

40|$|The authors examine {{flight capital}} {{in the context of}} {{portfolio}} choice. They estimate the stock of flight capital held abroad and compare it with the stock of real (nonfinancial) capital held within each country. For 51 countries they construct estimates (as of 1990) of private domestic capital and flight capital - which combined add up to domestic wealth. There are large regional differences in the proportion of private wealth that is held abroad, ranging from 3 percent in South Asia to 39 percent in Africa. They explain differences in portfolio choice in terms of the capital to labor ratio, indebtedness, exchange rate distortions, and risk ratings - all proxies for differences in the risk-adjusted rate of return on capital. They then apply the results to four policy questions in which private portfolio choices are potentially important: the effect of the East Asian crisis on domestic capital outflows; spillovers; the effect of HIPC debt relief on capital repatriation; and why Africa has so much of its private wealth outside the continent. Their conclusions: 1) The four most severely affected East Asian countries will eventually lose about $ 250 billion in domestic wealth {{as a result of the}} deterioration in risk between March 1997 and September 1998. 2) They found some support for a spillover model. 3) The effect of the HIPC debt relief initiative on <b>capital</b> <b>repatriation</b> will vary massively between HIPC-eligible countries. 4) Africa has by far the lowest capital per worker, which makes massive capital flight from Africa all the more distinctive.

40|$|Despite {{the recent}} {{increase}} in capital flows to Sub-Saharan Africa, the region remains largely marginalized in financial globalization and chronically dependent on official development aid. And with the potential decline {{in the level of}} official development assistance in a context of global financial crisis, the need to increase domestic resources mobilization as well as non-debt generating external resources is critical now more than ever before. However, the debate on resource mobilization has overlooked an important untapped source of funds consisting of the massive stocks of private wealth stashed in Western financial centers, a substantial part of which left the region in the form of capital flight. This paper argues that the <b>repatriation</b> of flight <b>capital</b> should take a more prominent place in this debate from a moral standpoint and for clear economic reasons. On the moral side, the argument is that {{a large proportion of the}} capital flight legitimately belongs to the Africans and therefore must be restituted to the legitimate claimants. The economic argument is that <b>repatriation</b> of flight <b>capital</b> will propel the sub-continent on a higher sustainable growth path while preserving its financial stability and without mortgaging the welfare of its future generations through external borrowing. The analysis in the paper demonstrates quantitatively that the gains from repatriation are large and dominate the expected benefits from other sources such as debt relief. It is estimated that if only a quarter of the stock of capital flight was repatriated to Sub-Saharan Africa, the region would go from trailing to leading other developing regions in terms of domestic investment, thus initiating a ‘big-push’-led sustainable long-term economic growth. The paper proposes some strategies for inducing <b>capital</b> flight <b>repatriation,</b> but cautions that the success of this program is contingent on strong political will on the part of African and Western governments and effective coordination and cooperation at the global level.

40|$|Abstract: The 1986 Tax Reform Act {{introduced}} {{changes that}} potentially alter capital flows {{into and out}} of the United States, particularly for financial companies. This paper uses data from 1982 to 1997 to assess the evolution of net U. S. <b>capital</b> outflows (net <b>repatriations)</b> in banking and finance relative to other industries. The results of this paper indicate that net U. S. capital outflows in the banking and finance industry were much lower than in other industries after 1986, even after controlling for general finance company differences, a time trend, exchange rates, tax rates, and country fixed effects. Once controlling for the trend over time, net capital outflows were not different before and after 1986 for industries other than banking and finance, but are significantly lower for banking and finance companies after 1986. The results are interpreted to suggest that TRA 86 did not influence net capital outflows for most industries, but that changes in Subpart F for financial companies lead to a significantly lower outflow in the banking and finance industry. 1 Taxation of capital is particularly difficult in a world of increasingly mobile capital flows. U. S. international tax law limits the tax advantage of moving capital overseas to a low tax jurisdiction by taxing the worldwide income of U. S. taxpayers (a credit being given for taxe...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. In {{common with}} {{emerging}} countries in Asia and Latin America, South Africa received substantial capital inflows following socio-political and financial liberalisation in the mid- 1990 s. However, {{unlike many other}} emerging countries, the bulk of South Africa’s post-liberalisation inflows {{have been in the}} traditionally short-term forms of portfolio and other investment. Hence, in this thesis, a macroeconometric analysis of South Africa’s post-liberalisation capital flow components is conducted to investigate the extent to which their divergent impacts have complicated, or even rendered impotent, the dual policy goals of attracting capital inflows on the one hand, while mitigating any significant detrimental impacts on the other. The results of the analysis show that foreign direct investment is responsive to domestic factors, while portfolio and other flows respond to a combination of domestic and foreign factors. However, domestic business cycle fluctuations are found to have a greater effect on the capital outflows than the capital inflows, and are thus associated with heightened <b>capital</b> flight and <b>repatriation</b> during expansionary phases. Although the capital flow components are found to have varied effects on South Africa’s macroeconomy, transmission mechanisms, nominal Rand/U. S. Dollar exchange rate, and economic growth dynamics, the ‘hot’ flows are found to demonstrate greater boom-bust characteristics compared to foreign direct investment. Conventional economic theory posits that the destabilising effects can be controlled using fiscal and monetary policy mechanisms. However, analysis of the cyclical relationships between the capital flows and fiscal policy finds that net direct investment and net other investment tend to be counter-cyclically associated with fiscal policy, while net portfolio investment tends to be acyclical, indicating that the bulk of South Africa’s net capital inflows do not have a significant cyclical relationship with fiscal policy. In addition, net direct investment and net other investment are found to have inconsistent cyclical relationships with monetary policy, while net portfolio investment tends to be procyclical. Thus, this research finds that although South Africa has been able to use exchange rate flexibility and sterilisation to neutralise the early stages of capital inflows, the divergent characteristics of the country’s post-liberalisation capital flow components have limited the fiscal and monetary policy options available to mitigate the detrimental capital flow effects arising from structural factors...|$|R

The Genoese Levantine colonies {{originated}} {{during the}} era of the Crusades (eleventh through fifteenth centuries) in a complex dynamic with the Byzantine Greeks, the Turkic dynasties of Anatolia, and various Latin warlords. In the eastern Mediterranean, the Aegean, and the Black Sea, a Genoese feudal aristocracy traded with the Byzantine and Turkic dynasties, and many Genoese families became extremely rich. But the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in 1453 signaled {{the beginning of the end}} of Genoese commercial dominance. Individual Genoese merchants continued to reside at Pera, just across the Golden Horn from Constantinople, and the Genoese colony of Caffa in Crimea held out until 1475. Chios continued under Genoese rule into the middle of the sixteenth century. Despite the loss of their Levantine colonies, the Genoese had by this point become the most powerful bankers in Europe. My hypothesis is that <b>capital</b> <b>repatriation</b> from the colonies to the western Mediterranean in the late fifteenth century contributed significantly to the success of Genoese banking in the sixteenth century.

40|$|The {{literature}} on the benefits and costs of financial globalization for developing countries has exploded in recent years, but along many disparate channels and {{with a variety of}} apparently conflicting results. For instance, there is still little robust evidence of the growth benefits of broad capital account liberalization, but a number of recent papers in the finance literature report that equity market liberalizations do significantly boost growth. Similarly, evidence based on microeconomic (firm- or industry-level) data shows some benefits of financial integration and the distortionary effects of capital controls, while the macroeconomic evidence remains inconclusive. We attempt to provide a unified conceptual framework for organizing this vast and growing literature. This framework allows us to provide a fresh synthetic perspective on the macroeconomic effects of financial globalization, in terms of both growth and volatility. Overall, our critical reading of the recent empirical literature is that it lends some qualified support to the view that developing countries can benefit from financial globalization, but with many nuances. On the other hand, there is little systematic evidence to support widely cited claims that financial globalization by itself leads to deeper and more costly developing country growth crises.

If these export items and the movements of some raw material prices are removed from the data no export enhancing effect can be found. In addition, in the past the composition of Georgian exports remained highly biased towards raw materials and simple products. Improvements in export came from the export of services, namely tourism and pipeline transport service. Later is a significant source of income as well as the transfers of Georgian migrants working abroad? The export of pipeline service might increase in future further if envisaged additional pipelines over Georgian soil realize. Since these are mainly built with foreign <b>capital</b> increasing profit <b>repatriation</b> will result in higher capital outflows in future. At the moment the EU negotiates an deep and comprehensive free trade agreement with Georgia which foresees beyond the abolition of tariffs the removal of all types of non-tariff barriers (NTBs). An important part of trade facilitation would be the adoption of EU standards and norms which hinder at the moments Georgian exporters. Although the EU is prepared to contribute with financial and technical help the removal of NTBs is costly for Georgian firms. The available studies forecast however significant positive effects from a comprehensive trade liberalization between the partners. Al-though not captured by the mentioned feasibility studies on a comprehensive EU-Georgian trade agreement, the strongest export enhancing effect for Georgia will only come from broadening the existing export basket. To do so best chances for Georgian firms are seen in transit services and the production of parts and components as a supplier for multinational firms. The existing range of export goods does not exploit effectively the comparative advantages of the country. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} short- and long-run effects of {{financial}} liberalization on capital markets. To do so, we construct a new comprehensive chronology of financial liberalization in 28 mature and emerging market economies since 1973. We also construct an algorithm to identify booms and busts in stock market prices. Our {{results indicate that}} financial liberalization is followed by more pronounced boom-bust cycles in the short run. However, financial liberalization leads to more stable markets in the long run. Finally, we analyze the sequencing of liberalization and institutional reforms to understand the contrasting short- and long-run effects of liberalization.
