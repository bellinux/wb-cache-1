5000|$|An {{injection}} molded plastic part {{is considered}} [...] "safe" [...] to remove from its mold {{once it is}} near or below the HDT. This means that part deformation will be held within acceptable limits after removal. The molding of plastics by necessity occurs at high temperatures (routinely 200 °C or higher) due to the low viscosity of plastics in fluid form (this issue can be addressed to some extent {{by the addition of}} plasticizers to the melt). Once plastic is in the mold, it must be cooled to a temperature to which little or no dimensional change will occur after removal. In general, plastics do not conduct heat well and so will take quite a while to cool to room temperature. One way to mitigate this is to use a <b>cold</b> <b>mold</b> (thereby increasing heat loss from the part).

This is of value to material processing applications which encompass extrusion, flow into <b>cold</b> <b>mold,</b> and generalized processing of nanocomposites. Through control {{and understanding of the}} structure processing relationships entailed through nanoscale additive materials, we begin to manage dispersion characteristics for more reliable and defect-free product development. In pursuit of identifying system characteristics that produce non-Einstein-like responses we isolate and characterize homogenous fractions of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) with singular lengths. This enables the definition of a well-defined nanoscale particulate phase, within the polymer matrices. The effect of nanotube length and weight fraction on the polyisobutylene (PIB) matrices was evaluated with thermal and rheological testing. Our findings show that the viscosity of the produced nanocomposite systems has a length dependence and does not demonstrate the expected monotonous increases in the viscosity with an increase in weight fraction of nanotube additive within the matrix, demonstrating a non-Einstein-like viscosity response. Furthermore, we demonstrate length dependent crystallization in the studied systems, as an intermediate length nanotube initiates crystallization of polyisobutylene (PIB) affecting viscosity and mechanical properties...|$|E

40|$|Carbon-fiber-reinforced {{thermoplastic}} (CFRTP) {{is viewed}} as a prospective material for high-cycle production of CFRP parts. This paper deals with a process whereby a preheated thermoplastic plain-woven carbon fiber fabric sheet is formed into a circular cup by a mechanical servo-press. The effects of press parameters, specifically the bottom dead center and slide speed in the forming of CFRTP cup, on the press load, pressure, internal temperature, shape accuracy, and internal structure have been investigated. A plain-woven carbon-fiber-reinforced PA 6 thermoplastic sheet was used. The sheet consisted of four layers of woven 3 K carbon and had a thickness of 1 mm. The sheet was heated to 320 °C under a halogen heater so that it would be around the recommended temperature for forming 260 °C after transfer to the mold. The sheet was pressed into a circular cup shape by a <b>cold</b> <b>mold</b> while the periphery was cramped by a heated holder so as not to cool the sheet before it was pulled into the mold cave. Die clearance was designed considering the thickness increase due to the fiber concentration during the forming. By increasing the slide stroke to the bottom dead center, the applied press load was increased and the internal structure was improved, showing no voids. By increasing the slide speed, the final press load was reduced and shape accuracy was improved through a good pressure distribution on the mold. Measurement of the surface temperature of the sheet during the forming revealed that it remained in the melting region of the resin in the case of fast slide speed, but dropped below the melting temperature in the case of low slide speed. This difference apparently led to spring-in or spring-back after the forming. The experimental results indicate that appropriate balance among press speed, bottom dead center, and sheet temperature is important in the high-cycle forming of CFRTP. © 2016, Fuji Technology Press.
