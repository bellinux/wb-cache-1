Muller settled down in The Hague, where he was {{originally}} only occupied with his consular duties for Liberia, his membership of the Commission for Consular Examinations (since 1890) and his writing. Early in 1896 Muller was appointed as consul for the Orange Free State in the provinces of North and South Holland, assisting the consul general H.A.L. Hamelberg. He received the appointment on the strength of his publications about South Africa. After Hamelberg's death later in 1896 Muller succeeded him as consul general. It was an honorary position. In the following years Muller wholeheartedly set out to work for the Orange Free State and its interests in Europe. His predecessor Hamelberg had not only been consul general, but had on occasion also acted as special envoy to be able to negotiate treaties and accords with foreign powers. Muller also acted as special envoy and in this capacity inter alia enrolled the Orange Free State in the Universal Postal Union, the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, and the Geneva Conventions, and negotiated treaties of friendship and trade with Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. He also strengthened the <b>consular</b> <b>representation</b> of the Orange Free State in Europe and inquired into all kinds of practical issues like a cure for rinderpest and improved methods of irrigation.|$|E

5000|$|In 1932 the Portuguese {{dictatorship}} of Antonio de Oliveira Salazar had begun and by 1933 {{the secret police}} was created, the State Defense and Surveillance Police, PVDE. According to historian Avraham Milgram by 1938 Salazar [...] "knew the Nazis' approach to the 'Jewish question'. From fears that aliens may undermine the regime, entry was severely limited. Toward this end the apparatus of the PVDE was extended with its International Department given greater control over border patrol and the entry of aliens. Presumably most aliens wishing to enter Portugal at that time were Jews." [...] Portugal during World War II like its European counterparts adopted tighter immigration policies preventing refuges from settling in the country. Circular 10, on October 28 of 1938, addressed to <b>consular</b> <b>representations,</b> deemed that settling was forbidden to Jews, allowing entrance on a tourist visa for thirty days.|$|R

This paper analyses the cooperation established between Slovenian public servants and diplomats and their European counterparts during their country’s term in office as Presidency of the EU {{in the first half}} of 2008. The findings are based on a survey conducted among 667 Slovenian public servants, experts and diplomats directly involved in the policy-making process during Slovenia’s Presidency. It looks into the nature, frequency and importance (as rated by Slovenes themselves) of formal and informal cooperation and contacts of Slovenian public servants, experts and diplomats with officials of the Council Secretariat and European Commission as well as national representatives of the other member states. The analysis distinguishes between responses by capital- and Brussels-based staff and also reflects the views of traditional diplomats at Slovenian diplomatic and <b>consular</b> <b>representations.</b> The paper analyses their perception on the cooperation established in selected policy fields in which the Presidency assumed different roles: organiser, broker, leader and national representative...|$|R

40|$|OS REGISTROS administrativos dos vistos consulares de residência, mesmo quando disponibilizados, tanto pelos consulados estrangeiros no Brasil quanto por aqueles do país no exterior, não permitem {{calcular}} os fluxos de imigrantes e de emigrantes internacionais, em razão da alta proporção de migrantes clandestinos ou ilegais. Como conseqüência, não se pode saber, a partir dos registros, nem sequer se o Brasil tem tido saldos migratórios internacionais positivos ou negativos. Técnicas indiretas permitem estimar o saldo migratório internacional, a partir das populações enumeradas em dois censos consecutivos. Na data do segundo censo, são comparadas as populações observada (recenseada) e esperada (aquela que se teria, se porventura a população do país tivesse permanecido fechada entre os dois censos). A diferença entre elas corresponde, em princípio, ao saldo migratório internacional. Apesar das dificuldades técnicas, advindas principalmente da significativa variação de cobertura entre os Censos de 1991 e de 2000, concluiu-se que o Brasil teria tido, entre 1980 e 1990, um saldo migratório negativo de aproximadamente 1. 800 mil pessoas. O saldo, também negativo, teria caído significativamente, no decênio 1990 / 2000, para em torno de 550 mil pessoas. Esse declínio teria ocorrido em razão, quase que inteiramente, da diminuição da emigração brasileira. A imigração internacional aumentou muito pouco, como se pode constatar a partir dos dados censitários de 1991 e 2000. ADMINISTRATIVE {{records from}} <b>consular</b> <b>representations</b> in Brazil and abroad are not adequate to estimate international migration balance (the difference between inmigration and emigration) for two main reasons. First, such {{data are not}} always available. Second, even if available, these data are not reliable sources of internatonal migration flows due to underestimation of illegal migration. Thus, {{it is not possible}} to use these records to unveil the magnitude and direction of Brazil’s international migration balance. Indirect techniques allows estimating international migration balance from two consecutive censuses. These techniques involve comparing the population in the second census (the "observed population") and an "expected population", which is an estimation of the closed population in the second census (that is, the expected population in the second census assuming absence of international migration - emigration and inmigration - between the two censuses). The difference between the observed and the closed population is a proxy of the international migration balance. Even considering problems in these estmations, notably the variability in census coverage rates between 1980 and 1991, it can be inferred that Brazil had a negative migraton balance (or alternatively, a higher number of emigrants compared to inmigrants) of about 1. 8 million people. The balance, still negative, felt to about 550, 000 people between 1990 - 2000. This decline can be attributed almost entirely to the decline in Brazilian emigration. The 1991 and 2000 censuses reveal a very small increase in Brazilian international inmigration...|$|R
