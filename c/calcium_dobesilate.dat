40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Calcium</b> <b>dobesilate</b> is an angioprotective {{agent that}} has {{positive}} effects on hemorheological parameters. It is an antioxidant that increases endothelial-derived vasodilator substance secretion, there are none that analyze its effects during the postoperative period of patients undergoing myocardial revascularization. OBJECTIVE: We aimed {{to determine the effects}} of <b>calcium</b> <b>dobesilate</b> on hemorheological parameters, such as reduced glutathione and malondialdehyde in patients with ischemic heart disease undergoing myocardial revascularization in the postoperative period. METHODS: One hundred and thirty-four patients operated for coronary heart disease were included in this study. Hemorheological, oxidant and antioxidant parameters were measured two days after surgery and after a period of treatment with <b>calcium</b> <b>dobesilate.</b> Then, 500 mg of <b>calcium</b> <b>dobesilate</b> was given twice a day to one group of 68 patients for three months. The control group was composed of 66 patients who did not receive this medication. RESULTS: The increase in the erythrocyte deformability index was found to be significant compared with both the pretreatment values and with the 1 st and 2 nd values of the control group after <b>calcium</b> <b>dobesilate</b> administration, whereas there were no significant changes in blood viscosity, glutathione (GSH) or malondialdehyde (MDA) values after the <b>calcium</b> <b>dobesilate</b> administration. The same improvement in the CCS class was observed in patients regardless of they received the <b>calcium</b> <b>dobesilate</b> treatment. CONCLUSION: In the present investigation, the same improvement in the CCS class was observed in patients regardless of they received the <b>calcium</b> <b>dobesilate</b> treatment. Improvements with <b>calcium</b> <b>dobesilate</b> were statistically significant only in the increase in erythrocyte flexibility...|$|E

40|$|Chronic venous {{insufficiency}} (CVI) causes much discomfort and sick leave. Many randomized clinical trials (RCTs) {{have shown a}} beneficial effect of <b>calcium</b> <b>dobesilate,</b> but consensus is lacking about efficacy and safety. The authors report a meta-analysis of the effectiveness and safety of <b>calcium</b> <b>dobesilate</b> in CVI. Ten RCTs (778 patients) in which <b>calcium</b> <b>dobesilate</b> for CVI was compared with placebo met the inclusion criteria. Only 3 trials (608 patients) were of good methodological quality. <b>Calcium</b> <b>dobesilate</b> significantly improved night cramps and discomfort nearly twice as well as placebo, with the number needed to treat (NNT) being 8 (95 % CI 4 – 50) and 4 (95 % CI 3 – 7), respectively. Frequency of adverse events was not signifi-cantly different from placebo. Subgroup analysis found a differential response with respect to disease severity, with greater improvements in pain, heaviness, and malleolar swelling being seen in the severe group than in the mild group. <b>Calcium</b> <b>dobesilate</b> improved paresthesias significantly more than placebo in the severe {{but not in the}} mild group and the effect on leg volume was also significantly better in the severe group (– 7. 2 % vs – 1. 6 %).

40|$|Purpose <b>Calcium</b> <b>dobesilate</b> {{has been}} found to correct the {{excessive}} vascular permeability associated with diabetes in the retina of diabetic patients and in experimental diabetes. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are not elucidated yet. In this study, we investigated the potential protective effect of <b>calcium</b> <b>dobesilate</b> against changes in tight junction proteins (occludin, ZO- 1 and claudin- 5) induced by diabetes in the retina. Methods Diabetes was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (65 mg/kg) in two months old male Wistar rats (1 month diabetes duration). The animals were divided in three groups (7 - 8 animals/group) : control, diabetic, diabetic treated with <b>calcium</b> <b>dobesilate</b> (100 mg/kg/day; orally given) during the last 10 days of diabetes. The protein levels and distribution of the tight junction proteins were evaluated by western blotting and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Results Diabetes decreased occludin and claudin- 5 protein levels (65. 2 ± 7. 6 % and 63. 2 ± 5. 4 % of the control, respectively) in the retina. ZO- 1 levels were unchanged, but its distribution in retinal vessels was altered in the retinal vessels of diabetic animals. The treatment with <b>calcium</b> <b>dobesilate</b> prevented the changes in tight junction proteins induced by diabetes. Conclusion In conclusion, <b>calcium</b> <b>dobesilate</b> is able to prevent changes in tight junction proteins in retinal vessels induced by diabetes, which may explain its beneficial effects against diabetes-induced blood-retinal barrier breakdown.

Methods: Male Wistar rats were divided into seven groups: normal control, diabetes model(DM), diabetes with TWMM (3. 6, 7. 2, and 14. 4 g/kg) treatment, the positive control treatment groups of Qi Ming granules and <b>Calcium</b> <b>dobesilate</b> capsules. All rats were treated for 8 weeks. The levels of body weight, fasting blood glucose (FBG) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c) in blood were measured to evaluate the antihyperglycemic activity of TWMM. Furthermore, malondialdehyde (MDA), intracellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in serum were measured to study effects of TWMM on oxidative stress and inflammatory in DM 2 rats. VEGF, JAK/STAT signaling pathway and SOCS 3 in retina was detected by immunohistochemistry. Results: TWMM and the positive control drugs Qi Ming and <b>Calcium</b> <b>dobesilate</b> showed a remarkable suppression of retinal neovascularization and amelioration of retinal internal limiting membrane morphology. Moreover, TWMM significantly decreased HbA 1 c, MDA, ICAM- 1, and VEGF levels in serum of diabetic rats. However, Qi Ming granules showed significantly reduced MDA and VEGF levels (P < 0. 01, and P < 0. 05, respectively), <b>Calcium</b> <b>dobesilate</b> showed significantly reduced MDA and ICAM- 1 levels (P < 0. 01 and P < 0. 05, respectively) in serum.

40|$|To {{assess the}} effect of CLS 2210 (a new {{formulation}} of <b>calcium</b> <b>dobesilate)</b> {{on the evolution of}} acute myocardial infarction, 100 patients presenting their first infarct were distributed, according to their sequential admissions to the hospi-tal, into CLS 2210 -treated group (50 patients) or a comparison group (50 pa-tients not receiving CLS 2210). The two groups were similar in age, sex, predisposing factors, and site of infarction. Intravenous infusion of CLS 2210 was begun within six hours of onset of chest pain and continued for seventy-two hours. Thereafter, it was given, as oral capsules, in a dose of 1, 000 mg every eight hours throughout the hospitaliza-tion. Before and during the trial, blood samples were drawn for the measure-ments of serum concentrations of creatine kinase (CK), and twelve-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) were obtained serially in each patient. All objective data were analyzed on a coded basis without reference to the treatment. In the comparison group, thirty-six to forty-eight hours was required for C...|$|E
40|$|The {{syndrome}} “Palmar foot pain” often disguises {{the early}} stages of navicular disease. These early signs can be represented by an increased signal intensity in the navicular bone in fat suppressed images on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Increased signal intensity in these fat suppressed images probably represents bone oedema and potentiates an increased risk of osteoarthritis. One potential treatment modality for this condition is the use of <b>Calcium</b> <b>dobesilate.</b> This has an effect on pressure dynamics and could potentially be used as a treatment for navicular disease in horses if administered during {{the early stages}} of the syndrome. The aim of this study was to monitor both the degree of lameness and the MRI changes seen in twelve horses treated with <b>Calcium</b> <b>dobesilate</b> and displaying increased signal intensity from fat suppressed images in the spongiosa region of the navicular bone. Twelve horses with a front foot lameness which had been present for between one month and two years were selected for the study. Inclusion criteria were: absence of radiographic findings on standard foot radiographs and an increased signal intensity in fat suppressed images of the navicular bone spongiosa region without concurrent lesions being detected elsewhere on MRI scans of the foot. Horses were treated with <b>Calcium</b> <b>dobesilate</b> and were then subjected to a controlled exercise regime. They were re-evaluated at two and four months after treatment. In the first follow-up examination 83 % of the horses showed a reduced level of lameness whilst two months later this had increased to 91 %. At the end of the trial eight of the twelve horses were found to be sound. During the pilot study fat suppressed images of the navicular bone showed a reduction in the intensity of the signal from the medullary cavity following treatment. Polyacrylamide Hydrogel is a potential new treatment for degenerative osteoarthritis of the Distal Interphalangeal Joint (DIP joint) when conventional medication fails. In this case one ml of Polyacrylamide Hydrogel was applied to the DIP joint of twelve affected horses. All horses were displaying a chronic recurrent lameness on one or both fore limbs which had been present for more than three months and which had been found to be due to osteoarthritis of the DIP joint. These horses had been previously treated on at least two occasions with intra-articular medication such as Hyaluronic acid, Glucocorticoides and/or autologous conditioned serum. These treatments had proved unsuccessful. The diagnosis of osteoarthritis was based on the abolition of lameness using both regional and intra-articular anaesthesia and by using radiological and MRI findings. These cases were re-examined one and six months following treatment. Six months after treatment eight of the treated horses were now sound whilst a further two horses showed some improvement. The other two horses were unchanged. This case report demonstrates the development of an osseous cyst-like lesion in the spongiosa of the navicular bone in a “high level” show jumping horse displaying chronic intermittent fore limb lameness. The first evidence of navicular bone pathology was an increased signal intensity on fat suppressed images in the medulla of the right navicular bone. This progressed to a cystic lucency which could be identified radiographically at twenty four months of age. The horse´s progress was monitored over a period of twenty six months; this monitoring included lameness investigations, treatment, diagnostic radiographs and six follow-up standing low field MRI sessions. At the last clinical recheck the horse no longer showed signs of lameness and continued to perform in international showjumping events...|$|E
40|$|AIM:To {{observe the}} {{protective}} effect of <b>calcium</b> <b>dobesilate</b> on optic nerve of glaucoma patients whose intraocular pressure {{has been under}} control through operation. METHODS: A total of 78 inpatients(89 eyes) with glaucoma in this hospital from January, 2011 to February, 2012 were enrolled. All patients were randomly divided into treatment group and control group with 6 months in a course. The visual acuity, visual field(mean sensibility, MS), and intraocular pressure were measured at the experiment onset and 6 months later to evaluate the clinical effect. RESULTS: There were {{no statistically significant differences}} in the visual acuity, intraocular pressure between the two groups neither at the experiment onset nor after 6 months(P > 0. 05). The mean sensibility(MS) of the treatment group was obviously improved(14. 56 ± 5. 03 vs 18. 9 ± 5. 77, P vs 13. 48 ± 4. 69). There are statistically significant difference between the treatment group and the control group. Compared to the ratio of improvement, stability, and deterioration in the control group(10. 3 %, 48. 7 %, 41. 0 %), the indexes were changed obviously in the treatment group(64. 1 %, 28. 2 %, 7. 7 %, P CONCLUSION:Calcium dobesilate can improve mean retinal sensitivity and protect the optic nerve in glaucoma patients whose intraocular pressure has been controlled...|$|E
40|$|<b>Calcium</b> <b>dobesilate</b> (CaD) {{has been}} {{prescribed}} to some {{patients in the}} early stages of diabetic retinopathy to delay its progression. We previously reported that the treatment of diabetic animals (4 weeks of diabetes) with CaD, during the last 10 days of diabetes, prevents blood-retinal barrier breakdown. Here, we aimed to investigate whether later treatment of diabetic rats with CaD would reverse inflammatory processes in the retina. Diabetes was induced with streptozotocin, and 6 weeks after diabetes onset, CaD (100 mg/kg/day) was administered for 2 weeks. The treatment with CaD significantly increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels in the retina of nondiabetic animals (138. 6 ± 12. 8 % of control) and enhanced the diabetes-induced increase in GFAP levels (174. 8 ± 5. 6 % of control). In addition, CaD prevented the increase in mRNA and protein expression of tumor necrosis factor and interleukin- 1 β, as well as the formation of oxidized carbonyl residues and the increase in nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity, particularly in the ganglion cell layer of diabetic animals. We demonstrate that the treatment of diabetic animals with CaD can reverse the established proinflammatory processes in the retina. These beneficial effects appear to be attributed, at least partially, to the antioxidant properties of CaD. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|Copyright 2007 Adis Data Information BVBasal cell {{carcinoma}} (BCC) {{is the most}} common non-melanoma skin cancer, and its incidence continues to rise. Current management options are numerous and focus on tumour eradication while maximising cosmetic and functional capacity. Although surgery continues to be considered the main treatment modality, new pharmacological agents, such as immunomodulators, topical chemotherapeutic agents and photodynamic therapy, have emerged and show promising results. Pharmacological agents offer the potential for lower morbidity and improved tissue preservation compared with surgery and radiotherapy. However, pharmacological treatments possess higher failure rates when compared with surgery, and most studies have investigated only low-risk lesions. Several prospective, randomised, double-blind, vehicle-controlled studies have established the efficacy of imiquimod for superficial BCC. This review summarises the evidence regarding the mechanism, efficacy and safety of pharmacological agents based on the literature from the past 10 years. Experimental treatments that have been successfully utilised in the treatment of BCC are also discussed. Treatment of BCC with other agents, such as tazarotene, glycoalkaloid (BEC- 5) cream, cidofovir and <b>calcium</b> <b>dobesilate</b> have been reported, but further studies are needed to ascertain the efficacy and adverse-effect profiles of these treatments.

40|$|Cyclic edema is a {{clinical}} condition in women {{that leads to}} fluid retention in the orthostatic position. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the prevalence of idiopathic cyclic edema in women with lower limb lymphedema. The prevalence of idiopathic cyclic edema was evaluated in a retrospective study of 100 consecutive female patients submitted to leg lymphedema treatment at the Clínica Godoy. The diagnosis of lymphedema was clinical, based on patient history and a physical examination. Patients with clinical stage II lymphedema were included in the study with those in stages I and III being excluded. The diagnosis of idiopathic cyclic edema was based on the patient’s history and fluid retention of more than one kilogram between 7 : 00 a. m. and 5 : 00 p. m. Clinical signs of this disease include difficulty removing rings in the morning that becomes easier during the course of the day, waking up with a swollen face, and abdominal discomfort during the day. After diagnosing cyclic edema, a therapeutic test was performed using aminaphtone or <b>calcium</b> <b>dobesilate</b> with which fluid retention was reduced to less than 300 g during the same period.

40|$|Some {{cardiovascular}} disturbances which {{occur in}} diabetics are {{a consequence of}} alterations in vascular contractility {{as well as in}} endothelium-dependent relaxation. <b>Calcium</b> <b>dobesilate</b> (DOBE) is a drug used in diabetic retinopathy and its mechanism of action is not yet understood. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of DOBE on synthesis and release of endothelium-dependent relaxing factor (EDRF) and endothelium-dependent hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) in rabbit isolated aorta. Endothelium-dependent relaxation induced by acetylcholine (ACh) (10 − 8 – 10 − 5 [*]M) increased in the presence of DOBE 10 − 5 [*]M only when vascular endothelium was kept intact. NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 10 − 8 – 10 − 4 [*]M progressively decreased the enhancing effect of DOBE on endothelium-dependent relaxation whereas it was progressively increased by L-Arg. DOBE 10 − 5 [*]M increased in a non-significant manner endothelium-dependent relaxation induced by ACh when the arteries were incubated with both L-NAME 10 − 4 [*]M and indomethacin 10 − 6 [*]M. DOBE (10 − 6 [*]M and 10 − 5 [*]M) was able to scavenge superoxide anion radicals generated by the hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase reaction.

40|$|A {{shortage}} of available experimental data {{exists in the}} available bibliography on the release rate of <b>calcium</b> <b>dobesilate</b> (CD) from hydrogel formulations. Thus, {{the aim of the}} study was to evaluate the effect of selected hydrophilic nonionic polymers and anionic polymers on the release rate of CD from formulation provided for dermal application, as compared to the reference product in the market. The work utilized excised pork skin, while, Methylcellulose (MC), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), and anionic polymers (copolymers of acrylic acid) were used as CD carriers. The release study was executed by the pharmacopoeial paddle method, with extraction cells and fresh excised porcine skin as a membrane. CD in aqueous acceptor fluid was quantified by UV-VIS spectrometry at 300 nm. Subsequently, the kinetic curves were fitted to a zero-order kinetics model, a first-order kinetics model, a second-order kinetics model, as well as to the Higuchi model. The work saw that porcine ear skin influences the release pattern of the CD, compared to the artificial membrane. In the study, the evaluated formulations with MC, polyacrylic acid (PA) and polyacrylate crosspolymer 11 (PC- 11) deliver over 60 % of the active component (AC), within 250 min, through the excised porcine ear skin, to the acceptor compartment. Moreover, the release observed via porcine ear skin to the aqueous acceptor compartment is congenial to zero-order or first-order kinetics. In addition, the formulations prepared on the basis of MC and PA appear to control AC delivery, independently of actual concentration of AC...|$|E
40|$|We have {{evaluated}} {{the participation of}} endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) in the endothelium-dependent relaxation of isolated human penile resistance arteries (HPRA) and human corpus cavernosum (HCC) strips. In addition, {{the effect of the}} angioprotective agent, <b>calcium</b> <b>dobesilate</b> (DOBE), on the endothelium-dependent relaxation of these tissues was investigated. Combined inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX) nearly abolished the endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine (ACh) in HCC, while 60 % relaxation of HPRA was observed under these conditions. Endothelium-dependent relaxation of HPRA resistant to NOS and COX inhibition was prevented by raising the extracellular concentration of K+ (35 mM) or by blocking Ca 2 +-activated K+ channels, with apamin (APA; 100 nM) and charybdotoxin (CTX; 100 nM), suggesting the involvement of EDHF in these responses. Endothelium-dependent relaxation to ACh was markedly enhanced by DOBE (10 μM) in HPRA but not in HCC. The potentiating effects of DOBE on ACh-induced responses in HPRA, remained after NOS and COX inhibition, were reduced by inhibition of cytochrome P 450 oxygenase with miconazole (0. 3 mM) and were abolished by high K+ or a combination of APA and CTX. In vivo, DOBE (10 mg kg− 1 i. v.) significantly potentiated the erectile responses to cavernosal nerve stimulation in male rats. EDHF {{plays an important role in}} the endothelium-dependent relaxation of HPRA but not in HCC. DOBE significantly improves endothelium-dependent relaxation of HPRA mediated by EDHF and potentiates erectile responses in vivo. Thus, EDHF becomes a new therapeutic target for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) and DOBE could be considered a candidate for oral therapy for ED...|$|E
