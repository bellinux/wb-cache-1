40|$|Illustrated in Figure 3 and 4 are {{the results}} {{obtained}} during testing of the scaled <b>blast</b> <b>chamber.</b> In both cases the pressure dissipates over time, showing pulsating behaviour as the shockwaves reflect off the chamber walls. By looking at the peak pressure readings from the confined and unconfined graphs, {{it is clear that}} in both cases the pressure has increased by partially confining the open side by 65 %. Face-on pressure increased from 1 MPa up to 1. 7 Mpa, while side-on pressure readings increased from 0. 8 MPa to 0. 95 MPa in the confined state.

40|$|Gamma Chambers {{carrying}} {{radioactive source}} are transported in public domain {{and in addition}} are also used in various research laboratories and industries and hence the associated security concerns are important. With increase in global terrorism, these devices can potentially be targeted. Hence, {{it is imperative to}} study the performance of Gamma <b>Chambers</b> under <b>blast</b> loading. Numerical simulations were carried out using finite element analysis and later verified by experimental tests. There is a good agreement between the simulated and experimental results. The results show that there is hardly any damage to the containment of the Gamma <b>Chamber</b> under <b>blast</b> loading of 10 kg TNT equivalent charge at 1 m stand-off distance {{from the surface of the}} Gamma Chamber. However, components in the lower part of the Gamma Chamber get deformed exposing lead when 10 kg TNT equivalent charge is detonated below the main body of the Gamma <b>Chamber.</b> Post <b>blast</b> microstructure study was carried out to know the mode of fracture. It is concluded that the Gamma Chamber maintains its structural and shielding integrity under the conditions simulated in this experiment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|In the 1950s, the Swedish Air Board {{constructed}} {{an unusual}} test facility at Flygmotor. This was an engine test facility, {{a form of}} wind tunnel, which could operate at high inlet pressures, thus high Reynolds numbers. This tunnel was unique in being water-powered. A sealed underground <b>chamber</b> was <b>blasted</b> out of the granite beneath the Göta Canal. When the canal was allowed to flood the chamber, air was driven from it at high pressure and through the test chamber. A supersonic test of an engine could be carried out for around 10 minutes, after which it took 24 hours to pump the chamber dry again. Use of this test facility was shared with Rolls-Royce, who used it in 1953 to develop the afterburners of the Avon RA7 engine for the Supermarine Swift F3 and Saab 32 Lansen. The Avon RA14 afterburner would also be tested here, produced as the Flygmotor RM6B for the Saab 35 Draken.|$|R
40|$|Given the {{frequent}} use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) around the world, the study of traumatic blast injuries is of increasing interest. The ear {{is the most common}} organ affected by blast injury because it is the body's most sensitive pressure transducer. We fabricated a <b>blast</b> <b>chamber</b> to re-create <b>blast</b> profiles similar to that of IEDs and used it to develop a reproducible mouse model to study blast-induced hearing loss. The tympanic membrane was perforated in all mice after blast exposure and found to heal spontaneously. Micro-computed tomography demonstrated no evidence for middle ear or otic capsule injuries; however, the healed tympanic membrane was thickened. Auditory brainstem response and distortion product otoacoustic emission threshold shifts were found to be correlated with blast intensity. As well, these threshold shifts were larger than those found in control mice that underwent surgical perforation of their tympanic membranes, indicating cochlear trauma. Histological studies one week and three months after the blast demonstrated no disruption or damage to the intra-cochlear membranes. However, there was loss of outer hair cells (OHCs) within the basal turn of the cochlea and decreased spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) and afferent nerve synapses. Using our mouse model that recapitulates human IED exposure, our results identify that the mechanisms underlying blast-induced hearing loss does not include gross membranous rupture as is commonly believed. Instead, there is both OHC and SGN loss that produce auditory dysfunction...|$|R

It is the best-preserved of the Koryo dynasty royal tombs, and a popular tourist site. Construction on the tombs began after Queen Noguk's death in 1365, and was {{completed}} seven years later in 1372.

40|$|NUKEM Technologies was {{contracted}} to supply a dry, automated drum belt (tumbling) Abrasive Blasting Unit (ABU) to the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission in Ispra, Italy. The ABU {{was installed in}} the centralised radioactive waste management area of the JRC-Ispra site in Italy. The unit is to be employed for the decontamination to clearance levels of slightly contaminated metal components and, where practical, concrete or heavy concrete (density ~ 3200 kg/m³) blocks arising from the dismantling of nuclear facilities. The presentation {{is based on the}} successful construction and installation of the ABU at the JRC Ispra site. Among the several possibilities of adapting conventional abrasive units to nuclear applications, an automatic tumbling machine was preferred, due to the larger output and (mainly) for the ease of operation, with minimum direct handling of contaminated material by operators, thus satisfying the ALARA principle. Consideration was also given to Belgoprocess' successful experience with a predecessor, similar unit. After adequate size reduction batches of up to about 800 kg of material to be decontaminated are automatically introduced into the <b>blasting</b> <b>chamber.</b> Pieces between 100 mm and 800 mm long, between 100 mm and 500 mm wide and between 5 mm and 300 mm high can be effectively treated in the unit, the maximum weight of a single piece being limited to 100 kg. Pipes less than 300 mm long and with an internal diameter larger than 40 mm and other components with hard-to-reach surfaces may be included. The content of the chamber is tumbled by two bladed drums, while sharp steel grit is sprayed onto the contaminated components, thus removing the surface layer including any contamination. From experience, 30 minutes of treatment is sufficient to remove contamination to levels below expected clearance levels for most materials. The decontaminated components are removed from the <b>blasting</b> <b>chamber</b> automatically and collected in skips. Dust and grit are led to a series of separators; the grit gets recycled to the <b>blasting</b> <b>chamber,</b> cleaned off contaminants such as paint are fed to collection bins, and the dust is bagged into waste drums. Airflow through the whole system cleans the decontaminated components, transports the dust to the collecting area, and acts as a dynamic barrier to limit risks of contamination of the surrounding areas. Prior to release back into the room, the air is filtered in a series of automatically cleaned filters, followed by HEPA filters. The whole facility is operated in an automatic mode: the operators are only required to place drums or pallets of contaminated material onto the feeder, and remove skips of decontaminated material and drums of secondary waste such as dust. The presentation will describe the system and potential applications in the nuclear industry in detail. JRC. C. 1 -Nuclear Decommissionin...|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, the BATF {{has ruled}} that since the sound waves are not {{dampened}} and are metered at the same levels at two measuring points (1 m {{to the left and}} 0 m in front of the muzzle and 1 m left and 5 m forward of the muzzle) this is not a sound suppressing device. The only action which a muzzle shroud performs is shielding the area directly behind the muzzle from the worst blast pressures. Muzzle brakes direct the escaping gases rearward toward the shooter, thus increasing blast pressure directed toward the operator's ears. The same principle that lessens felt recoil also acts to enhance the sound levels reaching the shooter. Some of the muzzle brakes designed for heavy-caliber rifles (.338 Lapua, [...]408 CheyTac, [...]50 BMG) incorporate [...] "blast shields" [...] projecting laterally from the sides of the muzzle crown. Thus, reflecting sound waves traveling rearward via the muzzle brake <b>blast</b> <b>chambers.</b> These small leaves, however, do not fully enclose the muzzle diameter, and so block only the worst blast path, while allowing the majority of escaping gases to circumvent the shield by traveling around them, still reaching the shooter's ears, causing unacceptable hearing damage.|$|R
40|$|To better {{understand}} the effects of hypervelocity impact generated debris on S-band radio frequency (RF) transmission, a conical aeroshell was impacted by a Lexan projectile traveling at 6. 7 km/s. RF signals from four transmitting patch antennas mounted on the target were {{used to measure the}} debris effects. The aft impact produced a back-scattered debris cloud that slowed as it moved through the 2 torr atmosphere in the evacuated <b>blast</b> <b>chamber,</b> and the debris attenuated S-band signals by 2 to 4 orders of magnitude from their preimpact values. The average velocity of the RF-inhibiting debris ranged from 0. 7 to 1. 1 km/s depending on the distance traveled. At an intercept altitude of 230 km, the atmospheric pressure is 10 " 7 torr, there is no resistive force, and the debris should continue at its initial velocity. To gain {{better understand}}ing of the chamber atmosphere effects, a simple momentum transfer model for debris slowing in a nonviscous media was used to model debris propagation. The resistive force is proportional to V 2, and an initial (exoatmospheric) velocity of 1. 5 km/s was calculated. Therefore, debris velocities measured at 2 torr will overestimate telemetry link lifetimes by Vexo/Vavei which ranges from 1. 4 to 2. 1 in this experiment...|$|R
40|$|Combustion of {{reactive}} materials {{forms an}} active {{area of research}} for reactive fragment and structural materials applications. Currently, reactive fragment tests involve high velocity (1 - 2 km/s), large caliber projectiles directed into <b>blast</b> <b>chambers</b> where overpressure is measured to quantify output. Unfortunately, these existing facilities suffer many issues including high cost per test, which limits the ability to perform true parametric studies, as well as limited access in some cases for diagnostics other than transient pressure. To address these issues, we developed a small-scale reactive materials combustion test facility based on the Remington. 17 caliber rifle which safely launches projectiles at velocities approaching 1. 3 km/s. By making custom projectiles and firing these into a small chamber with complete optical access, {{we are able to}} obtain transient pressure and capture high-speed imagery. The setup also allows for optical measurements including pyrometry and spectroscopy. In this work the diagnostic measurements are primarily the bullet velocity and chamber overpressure. After completion of the design and installation of the laser optical chronograph and the appropriate pressure transducers, several tests at velocities of 1. 2 km/s were performed comparing inert bullets with those comprised of reactive metals in air, 100 % nitrogen, and 40 % oxygen rich environments. Therefore this paper outlines the major components of the combustion test facility, the system diagnostics and the effect that different intermetallics in various environments have on combustion performance. Results indicate that the facility performed as intended by capturing quantitative differences in the chemical energy release of various energetic systems. Further, through the post-processing of specimen residue with X-ray diffraction, the identification of reaction products provided better insight into the chemical reactions contributing to the observed energy release assisting in the determination of elements responsible for combustion performance...|$|R
40|$|Damage to the {{eye from}} blast {{exposure}} can occur {{as a result of}} the overpressure air-wave (primary injury), flying debris (secondary injury), blunt force trauma (tertiary injury), and/or chemical/thermal burns (quaternary injury). In this study, we investigated damage in the contralateral eye after a blast directed at the ipsilateral eye in the C 57 Bl/ 6 J and DBA/ 2 J mouse. Assessments of ocular health (gross pathology, electroretinogram recordings, optokinetic tracking, optical coherence tomography and histology) were performed at 3, 7, 14 and 28 days post-trauma. Olfactory epithelium and optic nerves were also examined. Anterior pathologies were more common in the DBA/ 2 J than in the C 57 Bl/ 6 and could be prevented with non-medicated viscous eye drops. Visual acuity decreased over time in both strains, but was more rapid and severe in the DBA/ 2 J. Retinal cell death was present in approximately 10 % of the retina at 7 and 28 days post-blast in both strains. Approximately 60 % of the cell death occurred in photoreceptors. Increased oxidative stress and microglial reactivity was detected in both strains, beginning at 3 days post-injury. However, there was no sign of injury to the olfactory epithelium or optic nerve in either strain. Although our model directs an overpressure air-wave at the left eye in a restrained and otherwise protected mouse, retinal damage was detected in the contralateral eye. The lack of damage to the olfactory epithelium and optic nerve, as well as the different timing of cell death as compared to the blast-exposed eye, suggests that the injuries were due to physical contact between the contralateral eye and the housing <b>chamber</b> of the <b>blast</b> device and not propagation of the blast wave through the head. Thus we describe a model of mild blunt eye trauma...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} collect solid {{debris from the}} target chamber {{following}} a NIF shot has application for both capsule diagnostics, particularly for fuel-ablator mix, and measuring cross sections relevant to the Stockpile Stewardship program and nuclear astrophysics. Simulations have shown that doping the capsule with up to 10 {sup 15 } atoms of an impurity not otherwise found in the capsule does not affect its performance. The dopant is an element that will undergo nuclear activations during the NIF implosion, forming radioactive species that can be collected and measured after extraction from the target chamber. For diagnostics, deuteron or alpha induced reactions {{can be used to}} probe the fuel-ablator mix. For measuring neutron cross sections, the dopant should be something that is sensitive to the 14 MeV neutrons produced through the fusion of deuterium and tritium. Developing the collector is a challenge due to the extreme environment of the NIF chamber. The collector surface is exposed to a large photon flux from x-rays and unconverted laser light before it is exposed to a debris wind that is formed from vaporized material from the target chamber center. The photons will ablate the collector surface to some extent, possibly impeding the debris from reaching the collector and sticking. In addition, the collector itself must be mechanically strong enough to withstand the large amount of energy it will be exposed to, and it should be something that will be easy to count and chemically process. In order to select the best material for the collector, a variety of different metals have been tested in the NIF chamber. They were exposed to high-energy laser shots in order to evaluate their postshot surface characterization, morphology, degree of melt, and their ability to retain debris from the chamber center. The first set of samples consisted of 1 mm thick pieces of aluminum that had been fielded in the <b>chamber</b> as <b>blast</b> shields protecting the neutron activation diagnostic. Ten of these pieces were fielded at the equator and one was fielded on the pole. The shields were analyzed using a combination of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), x-ray fluorescence (XRF), neutron activation analysis (NAA) and chemical leaching followed by mass spectrometry. On each shield, gold debris originating from the gold hohlraum was observed, as well as large quantities of debris that were present {{in the center of the}} target chamber at the time of the shot (i. e., stainless steel, indium, copper, etc.) Debris was visible in the SEM as large blobs or splats of material that had encountered the surface of the aluminum and stuck. The aluminum itself had obviously melted and condensed, and some of the large debris splats arrived after the surface had already hardened. Melt depth was determined by cross sectioning the pieces and measuring the melted surface layers via SEM. After the SEM analysis was completed, the pieces were sent for NAA at the USGS reactor and were analyzed by U. Greife at the Colorado School of Mines. The NAA showed that the majority of gold mass present on the shields was not in the form of large blobs and splats, but was present as small particulates that had most likely formed as condensed vapor. Further analysis showed that the gold was entrained in the melted aluminum surface layers and did not extend down into the bulk of the aluminum. Once the gold mass was accounted for from the NAA, it was determined that the aluminum fielded at the equator was collecting a fraction of the total gold hohlraum mass equivalent to 120 % {+-} 10 % of the solid angle subtended by the shield. The attached presentation has more information on the results of the aluminum blast shield analysis. In addition to the information given in the presentation, the surfaces of the shields have been chemically leached and submitted for mass spectrometric analysis. The results from that analysis are expected to arrive after the due date of this report and will be written up at a later time. Based on the results of the aluminum blast shield analysis, it was determined that additional materials needed to be tested as potential collectors in the NIF chamber. 1 - 2 mm thick pieces of tantalum, niobium, vanadium, silver, titanium, molybdenum, and graphite foil were fielded in the Wedge Range Filter (WRF) mount at a distance of 50 cm from target chamber center during the shock timing campaign. The pieces were subsequently removed and analyzed in a similar fashion to the aluminum shields. As of this writing, the pieces are still under analysis, but initial results indicate that gold debris was collected on the various materials. Currently, the pieces are being cross-sectioned so that the melt depths of each material can be compared. In addition, NAA and/or mass spectrometry will be performed in order to determine the total gold mass that was collected on each surface...|$|R
