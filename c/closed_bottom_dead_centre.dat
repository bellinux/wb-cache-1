40|$|A new {{hydraulic}} {{cam follower}} with {{variable valve timing}} (VVT) properties is described. Experimental {{results show that the}} point of closure of the valve may be delayed as a linear function of engine speed without external control. No other parameter of the valve event is modified by the device. An obvious application is the control of intake valve timing for engines with a wide speed range, where the point of valve closure could be scheduled with engine speed in order to maximise the trapped mass, hence improving the torque curve at low and high speeds. The device is considered for application to the Ford 2. 5 litre DI diesel engine, where it may be used to retard inlet valve closure from <b>close</b> to <b>bottom</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (BDC) at cranking speed to 50 - 60 deg after BDC at rated speed. This reduces the compromise in inlet valve timing across the speed range, thereby improving starting or allowing a small reduction of compression ratio, and improving the volumetric efficiency at low and high speeds. An experimental program is reported which consists of rig and engine work based on the Ford 2. 5 litre DI diesel engine. The engine testing shows that the device may be operated quietly, albeit on a diesel engine, and reliably over a wide speed range. The device is seen to be sensitive to oil inlet temperature such that when cold, measures are required to prevent late inlet valve closure...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} into in-cylinder swirl and tumble flow characteristics with reduced maximum valve lifts (MVL) is presented. The experimental work {{was conducted in}} the modified four-valve optical spark-ignition (SI) test engine with three different MVL. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) was employed for measuring in-cylinder air motion and measurement results were analyzed for examining flow field, swirl and tumble ratio variation and fluctuating kinetic energy distribution. Results of ensemble-averaged flow fields show that reduced MVL could produce strong swirl flow velocity, then resulted in very regular swirl motion in the late stage of the intake process. The strong swirl flow can maintain very well until the late compression stage. The reduction of MVL can also increase both high-frequency and low-frequency swirl flow fluctuating kinetic energy remarkably. Regarding tumble flow, results demonstrate that lower MVLs result in more horizontal intake flow velocity vectors which can be easily detected under the valve seat area. Although the result of lower MVLs show a higher tumble ratio when the piston is <b>close</b> to the <b>bottom</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (BDC), higher MVLs substantially produce higher tumble ratios which can be confirmed when most cylinder area lies in the measuring range...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. A decisive {{criterion}} for {{the selection of}} the optimal press line within the press shop's layout plan is the required press force. The press force necessary to form the component is defined significantly by the stroke range and the corresponding <b>bottom</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre.</b> The latter finalises the embossing process commonly used for reinforced structures on body components. The high forces required hereby strongly impact the deformation behaviour of the tool and the press and result in force requirements specific to individual presses. This paper examines the significant influences on the maximum force requirements. Examinations of the force requirements using parameter studies on bending, bulge test as well as embossing tests will be presented. The impact of the presses and tools rigidity was determined by way of extensive measurements performed on a mechanical and on a hydraulic press. The decisive criterion here is the <b>bottom</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre,</b> which can be reproducibly determined using a simple and reliable measurement technique...|$|R

40|$|The study {{investigates the}} {{mechanism}} of ring-liner lubrication {{in the vicinity of}} the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centres</b> of an internal combustion engine. Predicting lubricant transient behaviour is critical when the inlet reversal leads to thin films and inherent metal-to-metal interaction. It was found that the cavitation, which is located at the trailing edge of the contact before reversal, briefly survives after reversal as a confined bubble at the leading edge. This depletes the film promoting starvation. Several algorithms were compared. It is concluded that the lubricant film is thinner than initially thought...|$|R
50|$|This is {{different}} from the design of other oval style chainrings, which have the smaller effective chainring diameter coincide with the cranks being at top and <b>bottom</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (TDC and BDC), thus making the crank easier for the rider to turn through BDC for a constant chain tension. By having the chainring at its peak effective diameter with the cranks level, where the rider has maximum leverage over the crank during the power stroke, these designs are supposed to make better use of the rider's power output.|$|R
5000|$|While the {{coupling}} rods of a locomotive can be completely balanced by weights on the driving wheels since their motion is completely rotational, the reciprocating {{motions of the}} pistons, piston rods, main rods and valve gear cannot be balanced in this way. A two-cylinder locomotive has its two cranks [...] "quartered" [...] — set at 90° apart — so that the four power strokes of the double-acting pistons are evenly distributed around the cycle {{and there are no}} points at which both pistons are at top or <b>bottom</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> simultaneously.|$|R

[...] Therefore, if the crank is stationary and happens to be at one of these two points, it cannot be started moving by the connecting rod. [...] For this reason, in steam locomotives, whose wheels are driven by cranks, the connecting rods are attached to the wheels at points separated by some angle, so that regardless of the position of the wheels when the engine starts, at least one connecting rod will be able to exert torque to start the train.|$|R

50|$|The Scotch yoke is {{not used}} in most {{internal}} combustion engines because of the rapid wear of the slot in the yoke caused by sliding friction and high contact pressures.

Also, increased heat loss during combustion due to extended dwell at top <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> offsets any constant volume combustion improvements in real engines. In an engine application, less {{percent of the time}} is spent at <b>bottom</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> when compared to a conventional piston and crankshaft mechanism, which reduces blowdown time for two-stroke engines.

They push on two cranks/flywheels which cause them to rotate, each in opposite directions.

50|$|The {{high oil}} {{consumption}} problem {{associated with the}} Knight double sleeve valve was fixed with the Burt-McCollum single sleeve valve, as perfected by Bristol. The models that had the complex 'junk head' installed a non-return purging valve on it; as liquids cannot be compressed, the presence {{of oil in the}} head space would result in problems. Mike Hewland, after adding an expander ring that worked in reserve, found the oil consumption of his single sleeve valve engines was half that of a similar poppet valve engine. 'In this engine all we really have to lubricate is the crankshaft, the rest seems to lubricate itself' (C&D, Jul 1974). At top <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (TDC), the single-sleeve valve rotates in relation to the piston.

40|$|Incremental equal channel angular {{pressing}} (I-ECAP) is {{a process}} used for production of continuous ultrafine grained bars, plates and sheets.

50|$|In a {{naturally}} aspirated engine, air for combustion (diesel cycle in a diesel engine, or {{specific types of}} Otto cycle in gasoline engines - namely gasoline direct injection), or an air/fuel mixture (traditional Otto cycle petrol engines) is drawn into the engines cylinders by atmospheric pressure acting against a partial vacuum that occurs as the piston travels downwards toward <b>bottom</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> during the intake stroke. Owing to innate restriction in the engine's inlet tract which includes the intake manifold, a small pressure drop occurs as air is drawn in, resulting in a volumetric efficiency of less than 100 percent - and a less than complete air charge in the cylinder. The density of the air charge, and therefore the engine's maximum theoretical power output, {{in addition to being}} influenced by induction system restriction, is also affected by engine speed and atmospheric pressure, the latter which decreases as the operating altitude increases.|$|R
5000|$|Longevity, as {{demonstrated}} in early automotive applications of the Knight engine. Prior to the advent of leaded gasolines, poppet-valve engines typically required grinding of the valves and valve seats after 20,000 to 30,000 miles (32,000 to 48,000 km) of service. Sleeve valves did not suffer from the wear and recession caused by the repetitive impact of the poppet valve against its seat. Sleeve valves were also subjected to less intense heat build-up than poppet valves, owing to their greater area of contact with other metal surfaces. In the Knight engine, carbon build-up actually helped to improve the sealing of the sleeves, the engines being said to [...] "improve with use", in contrast to poppet valve engines, which lose compression and power as valves, valve stems and guides wear. Due to the continuous motion of the sleeve (Burt-McCollum type), the high wear points linked to poor lubrication in the TDC/BDC (<b>bottom</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre)</b> of piston travel within the cylinder are suppressed, so rings and cylinders lasted much longer.|$|R

The friction between piston ring pack and cylinder accounts for major portion of friction in {{an internal}} combustion engine and it also significantly affects the mechanical efficiency of the engine. In the piston ring pack, friction is mainly due to the compression ring, especially at the top <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> and <b>bottom</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> where boundary lubrication exists.

40|$|The {{piston rings}} {{are the most}} {{important}} part in engine which controls the lubricating oil consumption and blowby of the gases. The lubricating film of oil is provided to seal of gases towards crankcase and also to give smooth friction free translatory motion between rings and liner. Of the three rings present top ring is more crucial as it does the main work of restricting gases downwards the crankcase. Boundary lubrication is present at the Top <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (TDC) and <b>Bottom</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (BDC) of the liner surface. In addition to this, top ring is exposed to high temperature gases which makes the oil present near the top ring to get evaporated and decreasing its viscosity, making metal-metal contact most of the time. Due to this at TDC, excess wear happens on the liner which is termed as Top ring reversal bore wear. The wear rate depends upon many parameters such as lubrication condition, viscosity index, contact type, normal forces acting on ring, geometry of ring face, surface roughness, material property. The present work explores the wear depth for different geometries of barrel ring using Finite Element model with the help of Archard wear law and the same is validated through experimentation.

Under this condition, the demand of diesel oil mixing and combusting will be better satisfied. Moreover, the new structure will no longer forma small fluid retention zone at the lower end outside the chamber and will be more beneficial to the mixing of fuel oil and air, which has presented a new idea and theoretical foundation for the design and optimization of swirl chamber structure and is thus of good significance of guiding in this regard...|$|R
