50|$|Two matched {{transistors}} of {{the same}} polarity can be arranged to supply opposite halves of each cycle {{without the need for}} an output transformer, although in doing so the driver circuit often is asymmetric and one transistor will be used in a <b>common-emitter</b> <b>configuration</b> while the other is used as an emitter follower. This arrangement is less used today than during the 1970s; it can be implemented with few transistors (not so important today) but is relatively difficult to balance and to keep a low distortion.|$|E
50|$|This {{arrangement}} {{is not very}} common in low-frequency discrete circuits, where it is usually employed for amplifiers that require an unusually low input impedance, for example {{to act as a}} preamplifier for moving-coil microphones.However, it is popular in integrated circuits and in high-frequency amplifiers, for example for VHF and UHF, because its input capacitance does not suffer from the Miller effect, which degrades the bandwidth of the <b>common-emitter</b> <b>configuration,</b> and because of the relatively high isolation between the input and output. This high isolation means that there is little feedback from the output back to the input, leading to high stability.|$|E

40|$|An {{analytical}} {{study to}} quantify the substrate parasitic effects on SiGe HBT amplifiers in both common-base and <b>common-emitter</b> <b>configuration</b> is presented. The power gain relations and stability factors are derived from the modelled S-parameters which are computed at a fixed bias point from the small-signal hybrid-&# 8719; model of SiGe HBT in both configurations. It {{has been shown that}} the power gains of SiGe HBT amplifiers in both configurations are degraded when extrinsic and substrate parasitics are taken into account. The degradation in power gains is found to be more pronounced for CB configuration, which makes the design of HBT amplifiers, particularly in the CB mode, difficult. Close matching of the modelled data with the reported experimental results validates the proposed methodology...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We investigate, for {{the first}} time, the {{feasibility}} of operating silicon–germanium (SiGe) heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) in a weakly saturated bias regime to en-able ultralow-voltage RF front-end design. Measured dc, ac, and RF characteristics of third-generation high-performance SiGe HBTs operating in weak saturation are presented. Robust RF operation of 0. 12 × 6. 0 μm 2 SiGe HBTs are demonstrated in a <b>common–emitter</b> <b>configuration</b> at collector-to-emitter voltages above 0. 15 V. A noise figure of 1. 33 dB and an input third-order intercept point above − 8 dBm for a 3 -GHz input tone are achieved at 0. 30 V. These results have potential implications for RF circuits used in severely power-constrained systems.

40|$|A simple UHF Mixer {{operating}} at 430. 0 MHz is designed. The RF signal at 430. 0 MHz is down converted into IF frequency of 20. 0 MHz. • The mixer is targeted {{to have no}} attenuation (conversion gain of 0 dB) and an operating noise figure of less than 10 dB. • The design steps are divided into 5 parts. These are the DC biasing of the mixer circuit, S-parameters measurement for RF and IF, input matching, output matching and final design verification. Background: • The transistor chosen for the job is BFR 92 A which comes in SOT- 23 package. The maximum IC sustainable by the transistor is 30. 0 mA, with transition frequency fT = 5 GHz. • Since this is a large signal nonlinear circuit, substantial harmonics will be generated, therefore the chosen simulation method is the Harmonic Balance Method. • The transistor is biased in emitter degenerated <b>common-emitter</b> <b>configuration.</b> • The mixer is driven by a RF source with 50 Ohms source resistance, and LO (local oscillator) source with 50 Ohms source resistance and sustaining a load resistance of 50 Ohms. The block diagram of the mixer is shown in Figure 1. Power supply and decouplin...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the operating characteristics of NPN 4 H-SiC (a polytype of silicon carbide) {{bipolar junction transistor}} (BJT) and 4 H-SiC Darlington Pairs. A large amount of experimental data was collected. The wafer BJTs were able to block over the rated 600 V in the <b>common-emitter</b> <b>configuration</b> and the TO- 220 BJTs were able to block over the 1200 V rated voltage. In the thermal analysis, it is found out that at higher temperatures the forward and reverse (blocking) characteristics were stable at 100 °C and 200 °C. The transistors show positive temperature coefficients of forward voltage (Vf). In general the current gain () characteristics obtained (with VCE = 6 V) were approximately as expected for the BJTs. The ’s were very low (2 to 5 for wafer BJTs, 5 to 20 for the wafer Darlington Pairs, and 5 to 30 for TO- 220 BJTs). The large amount of experimental data collected confirms some of the superior properties of the Silicon carbide mate-rial when used to fabricate power semiconductor devices, namely high thermal conductivity and high tem-perature operability. The data presented here will establish the trends {{and the performance of}} silicon carbide devices. The silicon carbide BJT has fast switching and recovery characteristics. From the analysis, silicon carbide power devices will be smaller (about 20 times) than a similar silicon power device and with reduced power losses. Silicon carbide will also be very useful for device integration in high densities, as found in in...|$|E
40|$|Limited by {{increased}} parasitics and thermal effects as the device size becomes large, current commercial SiGe power HBTs {{are difficult to}} operate at X-band (8 - 12 GHz) with adequate power added efficiencies at high power levels. We found that, by changing the heterostructure and doping profile of SiGe HBTs, their power gain can be significantly improved without resorting to substantial lateral scaling. Furthermore, employing a common-base configuration with proper doping profile instead of a <b>common-emitter</b> <b>configuration</b> improves the power gain characteristics of SiGe HBTs, which thus permits these devices to be efficiently operated at X-band. In this paper, we report the results of SiGe power HBTs and MMIC power amplifiers operating at 8 - 10 GHz. At 10 GHz, 22. 5 dBm (178 mW) RF output power with concurrent gain of 7. 32 dB is measured at the peak power-added efficiency of 20. 0 % and the maximum RF output power of 24. 0 dBm (250 mW) is achieved from a 20 emitter finger SiGe power HBT. Demonstration of single-stage X-band medium-power linear MMIC power amplifier is also realized at 8 GHz. Employing a 10 -emitter finger SiGe HBT and on-chip input and output matching passive components, a linear gain of 9. 7 dB, a {{maximum output power of}} 23. 4 dBm and peak power added efficiency of 16 % is achieved from the power amplifier. The MMIC exhibits very low distortion with third order intermodulation (IM) suppression C/I of - 13 dBc at output power of 21. 2 dBm and over 20 dBm third order output intercept point (OIP 3) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{ever-increasing}} {{demand for}} broadband {{capacity of the}} global optical communication networks puts enormous requirements on the semiconductor laser used in the optical transmitter. Industrial standard bodies for optical communication project requirements of single-channel data rates as high as 100 Gbit/s around year 2020. This is a significant step with respect to today's technology which is only at the verge of introducing 25 Gbit/s emitters. The preferred light source for these applications is the vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) which can offer cost- and power-efficient directly modulated operation. However, it has proven extremely difficult to push the modulation bandwidth of VCSELs beyond 30 GHz and radically new device concepts are demanded to meet the upcoming needs. One such new device paradigm consists of the transistor laser which is the fusion of a semiconductor laser and a high-speed heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) into a single device, with potential significant advantages in modulation bandwidth, noise properties and novel functionality {{by virtue of the}} three-terminal configuration. The present thesis deals with the design, fabrication and analysis of vertical-cavity surface-emitting transistor-lasers (T-VCSELs), a device previously not realized or investigated in great detail. GaAs-based T-VCSELs are investigated both theoretically and experimentally. A three-dimensional model is set up with a commercial software package and used for performance predictions and analysis as well as design and optimization purposes. It is concluded that a T-VCSEL biased in the common-base configuration may have a bandwidth surpassing those of conventional diode-type VCSELs or a T-VCSEL itself in the <b>common-emitter</b> <b>configuration.</b> Fabricated T-VCSELs make use of an epitaxial regrowth design to homogeneously integrate an AlGaAs/GaAs HBT and an InGaAs/GaAs VCSEL. An intracavity contacting scheme involving all three terminals, undoped distributed Bragg reflectors and modulation doping are used to ensure a low-loss laser structure. The first generation of devices showed sub-mA range base threshold current in combination with a high output power close to 2 mW but did not fulfill the requirements for a fully operational transistor laser since the transistor went into saturation before the onset of lasing (IBsat<IBth). From numerical simulations this premature saturation was demonstrated being due to a lateral potential variation within the device and large voltage drops along the base and collector regions. As a remedy to this problem the base region was redesigned for a reduced resistance and transistor current gain, and the saturation current could thereby be extended well beyond threshold. These devices showed excellent transistor-laser characteristics with clear gain-compression at threshold, mA-range base threshold current, mW-range output power, high-temperature operation to at least 60 °C, low collector-emitter offset voltage and record-low power dissipation during lasing. Furthermore, the collector-current breakdown characteristics was investigated in some detail and it is concluded that this, in contrast to previous models, presumably not is due to an intracavity photon reabsorption process but rather to a quantum-well band-filling effect.
