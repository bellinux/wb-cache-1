A large percentage of <b>cold</b> <b>laminate</b> for use in the print industry is PVC, although a wide range of other materials are available. Cold laminating processes are also used outside of the print industry, for example coating sheet glass or stainless steel with protective films.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- The {{resulted}} <b>cold</b> <b>laminated</b> {{aluminum foil}} is rolled in bales; the foil is then unrolled and rewound in rolls with some imposed parameters: the exterior {{diameter of the}} roll, the length and mass of the rewound foil. These parameters must be measured with imposed precision and during the technological process. The paper presents a measurement method that solves this practical problem in the aluminum processing industry; the method {{is based on the}} pulses generated by two rotary incremental encoders and an IBM-PC compatible computer displays the measured values, enables the parameter prescribing and assures a simple dialog with the user. An error analysis is also presented; it enables the estimation of the maximum probable absolute error for each parameter. Key-Words:- encoder, parameter, measurement, precision, error analysis. ...|$|R
50|$|Some substances, such as non-cubic crystals, can exhibit {{different}} thermal conductivities along different crystal axes, due {{to differences}} in phonon coupling along a given crystal axis. Sapphire is a notable example of variable thermal conductivity based on orientation and temperature, with 35 W/(m·K) along the C-axis and 32 W/(m·K) along the A-axis.Wood generally conducts better along the grain than across it. Other examples of materials where the thermal conductivity varies with direction are metals that have undergone heavy <b>cold</b> pressing, <b>laminated</b> materials, cables, the materials used for the Space Shuttle thermal protection system, and fiber-reinforced composite structures.|$|R

For the preparation of composite specimen, ARADUR HY 951 used as hardener with ARALDITE LY 556. From the experiment, moisture gain trends for different temperatures which vary with time.

50|$|Whether {{small office}} or {{industrial}} machines their primary {{function is to}} embellish or protect printed works. Such laminators are used to apply varying thicknesses of lamination film onto substrates such as paper or fabrics. The main advantage {{to the use of}} heated roll laminators is that of speed. Heated laminators use heated rollers or heated shoes to melt the glue which is applied to lamination film. The process of heating the glue prior to applying the film to a substrate allows for a faster application of the film. The laminates and adhesives used are generally cheaper to manufacture than <b>cold</b> roll <b>laminates,</b> often as much as half the cost depending on the comparison made. As the materials are non-adhesive until exposed to heat, they are much easier to handle. The glue is solid at room temperature, so lamination of this type is less likely to shift or warp after its application than pressure activated laminates, which rely on a highly viscous, adhesive fluid.|$|R
50|$|The {{replica of}} Friendship was {{commissioned}} by the National Park Service as The Friendship of Salem. It was built using modern materials and construction methods, while retaining {{the appearance of the}} original 18th-century ship. The hull is <b>cold</b> molded with <b>laminated</b> wood and epoxy. The replica's design is based on a model in the collections of the Peabody Essex Museum. The model was built by Thomas Russell, the Friendship's second mate, and Mr. Odell, the Friendship's carpenter, as a gift for Captain William Story's infant son. Russell and Odell made the model during a voyage to China and Sumatra from June 1802 to August 1804. The replica's color scheme was taken from an 1805 painting of the ship by marine artist, George Ropes.|$|R
40|$|The Sustainable Highway, {{consisting}} of a transparent canopy of <b>cold</b> bendable <b>laminated</b> glass, is a potential solution to negative effects of road traffic. It can be placed over the highway and uses several sub-systems to reduce noise nuisance, local air pollution {{as well as the}} emission of CO 2. As a consequence of this reduction, spatial development in general and more specifically the construction of houses becomes possible alongside the highway, where this previously was prohibited by environmental regulations. This research project has investigated the technological and socio-economical feasibility of the concept in addition to possible implementation strategies by answering the following research question: To what extent can the concept of The Sustainable Highway provide a technologically and socio-economically feasible solution to the negative side effects of road traffic and how could The Sustainable Highway be successfully implemented given the institutional context? From a technological perspective, The Sustainable Highway is a feasible concept. Technological systems which are applied in the concept are to a large extent proven and an independent second opinion endorses the advantages which Movares claims to offer with this concept. Although several technological uncertainties remain, on the whole the concept provides a technologically feasible alternative to common practices such as a noise barriers or a tunnel. The socio-economic feasibility of the concept depends on the location in which it will be realised. The possibility for spatial development and the revenues from building land form a large component of the benefits the concept can achieve. Therefore, when The Sustainable Highway is realised on a highway running through a densely populated urban area, where local residents experience severe hindrance from noise and air pollution and where building land can be developed in the area, it is a socio economically feasible alternative. From an institutional perspective, {{there has to be a}} window of opportunity in order to successfully introduce the concept, and the institutional context should not pose additional limitations to the concept. Gaining the support of local parties and forming a consortium of private parties which is able to realise The Sustainable Highway are the first steps towards implementing the concept into its institutional context.

Laminated glass is comprised of multiple plates of glass bonded together with polymorphous interlayers. The interest in the use of architectural laminated glass in the construction industry has increased due to its possible advantages over monolithic glass. Some of the advantageous properties of laminated glass include a greater impact resistance, improved sound resistance, and better thermal insulation inside the structure. The most important advantage of laminated glass as compared to monolithic glass is its improved safety. Should failure of laminated glass occur, the interlayer would adhere to the surrounding glass plates. This would prevent the glass from shattering and potentially harming any inhabitants of the structure. Although these advantages are generally accepted, the performance of laminated glass is highly disputed. Of particular interest are the performance of laminated glass at various temperatures and its response to loading over a duration of time. There are two primary objectives of this thesis. First, the effect of temperature on the elastic bending stiffness of laminated glass with a polyvinyl butyral (PVB) based interlayer is to be resolved. The creep response with respect to temperature will also be observed. Second, the design method for laminated glass will be evaluated. This includes determining the effectiveness of the existing models of laminated glass. This investigation will include typical three point loading on two types of architectural laminated glass. These tests will be conducted at various temperatures to determine the effect of temperature on the bending of laminated glass. The results of these experiments show that temperature is the most influential property in the determination of the behavior of laminated glass beams. It is shown in this thesis that at <b>cold</b> temperatures, <b>laminated</b> glass approaches the performance of the true monolithic model. Furthermore, it is shown that at hot temperatures, laminated glass is bound by the performance of the layered model. The results of this thesis indicate that a return to the traditional design procedure is warranted until further research is conducted...|$|R
