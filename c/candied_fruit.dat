25|$|The liquid used in Snap-dragon was {{typically}} brandy, although similar flammable liquors {{could also be}} used.

40|$|The {{production}} of <b>candied</b> <b>fruits</b> {{is a priority}} development area of the food industry. The basic process in <b>candied</b> <b>fruits</b> production is diffusion of sugar syrup into vegetable raw material. Kinetics of the diffusion processes depends on sucrose concentration, medium temperature, particles size and internal structure of the fruits. The experiments to determine the factors influencing the diffusion processes were carried out using the installation designed by the authors; the experimental dependences of sucrose concentration change in pumpkin <b>candied</b> <b>fruits</b> on time have been determined at temperatures of 20, 40, 60 and 80 °C. Cell sizes and diameter of pores between the cells in raw and blanched pumpkin have been determined. This {{makes it possible to}} determine the internal porosity of the pumpkin particle, the value of which determines the coefficient of mass transfer. On the basis of the experiments we derived the dependence, allowing to determine the mass transfer coefficients for sucrose molecules in blanched pumpkin fruits within the temperatures corresponding {{to the quality of the}} finished product. The experimental studies and the chosen mathematical model allow us to calculate the change in sucrose concentration in the pumpkin fruits in time at different temperatures and to determine the time required for the <b>candied</b> <b>fruits</b> to reach the equilibrium concentration. Also, the coefficients not depending on temperature, but depending only on the shape of the particles being saturated with sugar syrup, have been determined using the kinetic model of diffusion processes. The obtained theoretical dependences are in good agreement with the experimental data and substantiate the expediency of the chosen temperature and concentration ranges. The designed installation, the obtained experimental and theoretical dependences, and the calculated coefficients allow to create an intensive sucrose diffusion process in pumpkin particles during pumpkin <b>candied</b> <b>fruits</b> production. </p...|$|R
