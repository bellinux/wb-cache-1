50|$|At the League of Nations {{and during}} the San Francisco Conference (1945) before the formal {{founding}} of the United Nations, the interpreters played a vital and visible role in meetings. In consecutive interpretation, conference interpreters spoke from the same dais as the original speakers, and the speaker stops periodically so that the interpreter can interpret what has just been said while {{the participants in the}} meeting viewed and listened to the <b>consecutive</b> <b>interpreter.</b> The conference interpreters were often exposed to selected or large audiences and the media.In the late 1940s and the early 1950s, United Nations officials introduced simultaneous interpretation as a preferred method for the majority of UN meetings because it saved time and improved the quality of the output. Simultaneous interpreting - a mode that confined the interpreters in glass-encased booths aided with earpieces and microphones - arose in the 1920s and 1930s when American businessman Edward Filene and British engineer A. Gordon-Finlay developed simultaneous interpretation equipment with IBM, and was also used in the post-World War II Nazi war crime trials held in Nuremberg, Germany.|$|E
40|$|Taking {{notes in}} {{consecutive}} interpreting is of eminent significance. It {{is directly related}} to the specificity of consecutive interpreting, in the first line to the phase displacing: at first there is a text presented to be translated and afterwards its respective translation is produced. Written texts which are read aloud are more difficult in the reception than spoken texts. Even more difficult are specialized texts. If a specialized written text is presented orally in longer sequences the <b>consecutive</b> <b>interpreter</b> is able to translate it in the proper way only with help of taking notes...|$|E
40|$|In {{his paper}} ‘The Interpreter as a Performer’ Dr. Boris Naimushin argues that <b>consecutive</b> <b>interpreters</b> need focused {{training}} to develop specific performance skills different from linguistic skills and consecutive interpretation techniques. Teaching interpretation students about performing {{is not like}} teaching them how to reformulate or take notes. Of course, technical perfection is a given at any professional level, including conference interpretation. However, pretty much like successful solo performers who develop an ability to personally connect with the audience via their music, professional <b>consecutive</b> <b>interpreters</b> {{should be able to}} make that personal connection with their client and their audience via their behaviour and their voice developing the ability to do their best in almost any situation...|$|R

When working with specialized areas, interpreters are frequently faced with variation in terminology, especially due to the spoken language in use.

40|$|The {{author of}} this chapter {{discusses}} {{some aspects of the}} production stage in consecutive interpreting, such as text condensation, coherence and cohesion, linguistic register, the improvisation skill, public speaking as well as the notion of psychological stress in conference interpreting. The aim of the chapter is also to provide the reader with a handful of didactic suggestions and examples of exercises that should lead to enhanced quality of interpretation as a product. It is suggested in the present chapter that providing an accurate rendition of a speech in the target language is not enough to ensure a perfect interpretation. As an indispensable participant of a communication act, the <b>consecutive</b> <b>interpreter</b> should learn how to speak clearly, coherently and convincingly...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{translation}} {{literature is}} replete with discussions on the need of precision in interpretation. However, the functional theories, for instance, emphasize the role of function rather than precision, as being of primary importance. This study is aimed to highlight this priority in diplomatic settings where imprecise renderings may be needed by <b>consecutive</b> <b>interpreter</b> for subject-specific reasons. These causes are, mainly, non-cognitive, and classified into 3 groups in the paper, namely, commissioner-, commission- and commissionee-originated causes. It is suggested that in the consecutive interpreting of “sensitive” diplomatic texts, precision {{is not necessarily a}} norm. Though the research was made with Turkish-English language pair, the general conclusion of the unsuitability of maintaining blind faith in precision can readily be applied to any other language pair in the process of interpreting, in such sensitive settings...|$|E
40|$|This {{chapter is}} devoted to memory {{as one of the}} most {{important}} assets of a <b>consecutive</b> <b>interpreter.</b> First, it presents the most influencial models of memory, which divide memory generally into sensory, working and long-term memory. Then, applications of various memory types in consecutive interpreting are described: short-term auditory memory in decoding phonetic stimuli, phonological loop in processing complex sentences and long words, visuo-spatial sketchpad in visualisations, semantic long-term memory in tapping into background knowledge and episodic memory when working with previously interpreted speakers. Studies of memory involving interpreters and trainees are briefly reviewed to show that memory training is useful as part of interpreter training. This is followed by a range of exercises involving visualisations to show students if and to what extent imagery can be helpful to them in processing and remembering information when interpreting consecutively. Other exercises focus on long-term memory: students are trained to acquire terminology in short periods of time preceding interpreting in class and are shown how to practice memory individually at home...|$|E

25|$|Interpreters were {{recruited}} and {{examined by the}} respective countries in which the official languages were spoken: US, UK, France, the Soviet Union, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, {{as well as in}} special cases Belgium and the Netherlands. Many were former translators, army personnel, and linguists, some were experienced <b>consecutive</b> <b>interpreters,</b> others were ordinary individuals and even recent secondary school-graduates who led international lives in multilingual environments. It was, and still is believed, that the qualities that made the best interpreters were not just a perfect understanding of two or more languages, but more importantly a broad sense of culture, encyclopædic knowledge, inquisitiveness, as well as a naturally calm disposition.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} mental imagery as {{an important}} part of information processing performed during interpreting. Mental imagery is examined to see if visual processing used to remember the source text or to facilitate its understanding helps to ‗off-load‘ other cognitive (mainly linguistic) resources in interpreting. The discussion is based on a neurocognitively-oriented depictivist model by Kosslyn (1994). The overview of mental imagery processes and systems is followed by the discussion of imagery used in interpreting. First, imagery development in student interpreters is described {{on the basis of a}} note-taking course for would-be <b>consecutive</b> <b>interpreters</b> organized by the author at AMU. The initial part of the course devoted to imagery involves visualizations of geographical, descriptive and narrative texts. The description abounds in authentic examples and presents conclusions for interpreting trainers. Later, imagery as employed by professional interpreters is discussed on the basis of a qualitative survey. General implications of the use of mental imagery for cognitive processing limitations in interpreting are presented in the concluding section...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} {{the role of the}} Slovak-English {{interpreter}} working in the consecutive mode in the business environment especially with regard to rendering cultural references from source texts, whether these are (British) English or Slovak. Since culture in this thesis is taken in the broad sense of the whole way of life, cultural references can also be wide-ranging. The strategy an interpreter will opt for when interpreting cultural references depends on the circumstances under which he or she operates. Interpreting puts constraints on interpreters which make their activity distinct from translation of written texts, where in cases of unknown cultural references, translators can resort to the use of notes. Interpreters are engaged in mediating communication between (two) clients who do not share the same language and who come from differing cultural backgrounds. Due to differences between the (British) English and the Slovak cultures - in their material, spiritual and behavioural aspects - as well as due to lack of knowledge of cultural references which the clients of English-Slovak interpreting have and which was caused historically, some intercultural mediation is needed. Its particular forms are the outcome of the weighing of the circumstances under which the English-Slovak <b>consecutive</b> <b>interpreter</b> works. Moreover, business interpreting contains challenges {{in the form of the}} vocabulary of business, a relatively new area for Slovak interpreters. An interpreter, under all the above mentioned constraints, has to fulfil his or her role: to establish and maintain communication between the two parties. Therefore some of the strategies used will try to prevent miscommunication, while others will try to deal with miscommunication once it has occurred...|$|E
40|$|Among {{the tasks}} usually {{carried out by}} conference interpreters, the {{question}} was which task demands most attention or is the deepest {{in terms of the}} depth of processing hypothesis proposed by Craik and Lockhart (1972). Simultaneous interpretation is a complex form of human information processing, involving the perception, storage, retrieval, transformation and transmission of verbal information. Shadowing involves the imediate vocalization of auditorily presented stimuli in the same language, whereas simultaneous interpretation involves translation of the incoming message. Mic <b>consecutive</b> <b>interpreter</b> listens to a message in L 1, makes concurrent notes in L 2, and then delivers an oral translation of the original speech by way of his notes. In Experiment I, conference interpreters (both trainee and professional) shadowed, interpreted simultaneously and consecutively, as well as listeneýd to French passages before (a) recalling in English and (b) answering three recognition tests in source language measuring lexical, semantic and syntactic retention. Listening and consecutive interpretation, which yielded significantly higher recall scores than did shadowing, were considered deeper forms of processing than shadowing. Also, simultaneous listening and speaking impaired recall of the material. A second experiment eliminated the translation variable. Subjects listened to, shadowed and interpreted consecutively, English passages, followed by retention ffeasures in the same language. Only consecutive interpretation (labeled as 'consecutive reiteration') yielded scores that were significantly higher than shadowing. Listening and recalling in the same language demands less processing or effort than listening in one language and recalling in another. In a third experiment designed to examine the role played by notes, subjects (a) listened to, (b) interpreted a text consecutively and (c) took notes but had their notes unexpectedly removed and were asked to recall the original without rehearsal. Consecutive interpretation with notes kept during delivery yielded significantly higher retention scores than either other condition. Listening is as good a form of attending to a message as note-taking when notes are an external form of encoding. Notes coupled with review represent a useful strategy for subsequent recall but note-taking alone is of questionable value...|$|E
40|$|Misunderstanding {{has been}} deeply {{investigated}} in literature up to date. However, {{not much has}} been analyzed {{in the context of}} consecutive interpreting. Drawing on the experience as a practitioner in consecutive interpreting and as an instructor, this study revisits the initially intralingual model on triggers of misunderstanding, at interlingual level, in the sensitive setting of political and defense related bilateral talks. It is known that cognitive / non-cognitive loads become higher in such contexts, which would affect the occurrences of misunderstanding. The main aims of the study are twofold: i. to expand the analysis for the consecutive interpreting process. ii. to use this practical data accompanied by cases to discuss them during the consecutive interpreting classes as part of situated learning. Firstly, triggers of misunderstanding are noted, then cases, where possible, are given, followed by suggestions as to how would-be <b>consecutive</b> <b>interpreters</b> can cope with such misunderstanding. These are complemented by reactions to cases from class versus real settings about the mentioned types of misunderstanding. Thus, this descriptive paper proposes a tested constructivist approach to grow awareness and better cope with misunderstanding in sensitive settings for consecutive interpreting classes...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims {{to explore}} the complex role of <b>consecutive</b> <b>interpreters</b> in {{relation}} to context. Context shapes how interpreters are positioned within an interaction, conceived of as a multi-level framework comprising the textual level, the interactional level, and the institutional level. The empirical focus is interpreting in seminars run by a Turkish public institution and supported by an international organization {{in the framework of}} the country’s development towards EU accession. The case study relies on the triangulation of several types of data, different research methods and settings in order to provide {{a deeper understanding of the}} interpreter’s role in context. In accordance with the fieldwork strategy, the focus is on naturally occurring data, including user and interpreter surveys, interviews, and video-recordings of interpreted interactions. The findings of the study reveal that there may be a gap between the general role definitions of interpreters and the strategies they are expected to adopt. User expectations vary depending on situational factors and the role perceptions of interpreters do not necessarily match reality. The analysis of the interpreter’s role in two different events exhibiting a varying degree of formality and interactivity but sharing the same institutional context, interpreting mode, and interpreter, demonstrates the influence of context on the interpreter’s role...|$|R
40|$|In <b>consecutive</b> mode, <b>interpreters</b> {{take notes}} so that, when {{delivering}} {{the message in}} another language, they will remember the original in its entirety. Generally speaking, no two interpreters will take exactly the same notes for the same speech, as techniques and personal choices often differ. However, most interpreters use symbols and abbreviations, which are more quickly jotted down than words and which allow interpreters {{to distance themselves from}} words and better render ideas. This M. A. thesis describes the conception and development of a collaborative software application for symbol exchange among students of the University of Geneva’s Faculty of Translation and Interpreting (and possibly others). The sharing of symbols is expected to result in increased efficiency in the acquisition of note-taking as a skill. A prototype is proposed...|$|R
25|$|The Nuremberg Trials {{employed}} four official languages: English, German, French, and Russian. In {{order to}} address the complex linguistic issues that clouded over the proceedings, interpretation and translation departments had to be established. However, it was feared that consecutive interpretation would slow down the proceedings significantly. What is therefore unique in both the Nuremberg tribunals {{and history of the}} interpretation profession was the introduction of an entirely new technique, extempore simultaneous interpretation. This technique of interpretation requires the interpreter to listen to a speaker in a source (or passive) language and orally translate that speech into another language in real time, that is, simultaneously, through headsets and microphones. Interpreters were split into four sections, one for each official language, with three interpreters per section working from the other three languages into the fourth (their mother tongue). For instance, the English booth consisted of three interpreters, one working from German into English, one working from French, and one from Russian, etc. Defendants who did not speak any of the four official languages were provided with <b>consecutive</b> court <b>interpreters.</b> Some of the languages heard {{over the course of the}} proceedings included Yiddish, Hungarian, Czech, Ukrainian, and Polish.|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of a study carried out in Graz in 2009, the paper deals with the {{question}} of whether or not interpreting via Skype can be a viable alternative to in situ interpreting. The field of interpreting has been undergoing continuous changes (see Riccardi 2000 : 75). After the ascent of <b>consecutive</b> interpreting, when <b>interpreters</b> had to improvise by learning by doing and the subsequent breakthrough of simultaneous interpreting with the Nuremberg Trials (see Baigorri Jalón 1999 : 29 f; 21 ff.), another type of interpreting has gradually evolved: Remote Interpreting (RI). RI is defined as follows: “Remote Interpreting [ [...] . ] refer[s] to situations in which interpreters are no longer present in the meeting room, but work from a screen and earphones without a direct view of the meeting room or the speaker ” (Mouzourakis 2006 : 46; original emphasis...|$|R
40|$|The well-know “Tightrope Hypothesis” of Daniel Gile (2009) as {{a result}} of his equally famous Effort models in interpreting, states that interpreters work, most of the time, close to saturation. We must hereby take into account that Gile is almost {{exclusively}} speaking about conference interpreting. Moreover, it seems that this tightrope situation occurs mostly in simultaneous interpreting, but, this may even be more the case in consecutive interpreting. That does not sound logical, since in <b>consecutive</b> the <b>interpreter</b> has more time to analyze (the structure of) a speech and has on overview of it. A closer look though learns us though that the Effort Model of consecutive is pretty “overburdened” with 8 components (as opposed to 5 in simultaneous interpreting). Indeed, while doing <b>consecutive</b> interpreting, an <b>interpreter</b> is constantly doing more than one cognitive effort at a time. The most interesting benefit of the model(s) is the awareness that can be raised by trainers to students about this simultaneously ongoing efforts, by splitting them up and by giving training accordingly. In other words: if we distinguish different efforts, we can train students in different coping strategies to prevent the risk of saturation as defined by Gile. But how is all of this connected to the rather established practice of training consecutive before simultaneous? And is this practice really established or is it commonly accepted by the interpreter trainer “community”? Once decided on the best training practice for would-be interpreters, do we train coping strategies for spoken languages in a different way compared to sign languages? In other words: how language specific are interpreting tactics? Debra Russel (2005 : 147) states the following: Bruton (1985), Lambert (1984) and Seleskovitch and Lederer (1995) emphasize that it is through a progression of exercises aimed at teaching interpreters to grasp, analyze, remember, and only then reproduce the message of the speaker, that it is subsequently possible to proceed to acceptable simultaneous interpretation where required or desired. This last point is an interesting one when contrasted with the practices of some signed language interpreter education programs, where students are placed in a position to interpret simultaneously without the foundation of progressive exercises designed to hone text analysis and consecutive interpreting skills. Moreover, how can all this be seen in the light of liaison interpreting (be it medical, public services, legal or other) that is a specific kind of interpreting, mostly characterized by more cultural-specific issues, inter-personal realities (the interpreter is often face to face with his interlocutors) and shorter, not constructed or prepared, i. e. spontaneous forms of “speech”. In our presentation, we will try to highlight these issues, building not only on interpreting research, but mostly on experience we have gained through workshops and Training for trainers for spoken language interpreters. More specifically, we will give examples of the transition period and exercises from consecutive to simultaneous. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{empirical}} and interdisciplinary {{investigation into the}} <b>consecutive</b> conference <b>interpreter’s</b> (CCIr) role as intercultural mediator. It seeks {{to determine whether there}} is a case for intercultural mediation in conference interpreting despite the greater degree of cultural transparency that characterises discourse in conference interpreting situations (CISs) when compared with other settings such as community and/or court interpreting. It also proposes an account of the CCIr’s role as intercultural mediator as an alternative to other accounts of the interpreter’s role in the literature on conference interpreting because those accounts do not explain clearly the CCIr’s role or are in conflict with very well-established concepts and principles associated with translation/interpreting such as faithfulness, accuracy, neutrality or accessibility. The account of the CCIr’s role as intercultural mediator is derived from the principles of a theoretical framework that draws on the findings of the theory of sense (Seleskovitch and Lederer 1995) and Sperber and Wilson’s (1986; 1995) relevance theory of communication (RT). The account provides the basis for formulating a clearer definition of the concept of intercultural mediation in the context of consecutive conference interpreting (CCI). Analyses of two types of data underpin the investigation: data from authentic examples from interpreters’ actual performance and data from 295 responses to a worldwide survey of professional conference interpreters conducted by this researcher for use in this thesis. Results of both analyses confirm the case for intercultural mediation in CISs and the validity of the proposed account of the CCIr’s role as intercultural mediator though situationality has been found {{to play an important role}} in the extent to which intercultural mediation is needed. Results also shed light on CCIrs’ use of cultural mediation procedures and the role of interpreters’ professional status, experience and language direction on their ability/willingness to perform intercultural mediation.
