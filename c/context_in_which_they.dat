25|$|The Torah's {{story of}} {{creation}} {{is not intended}} as a scientific treatise, worthy of equal time with Darwin's theory of evolution in the curriculum of our public schools. The notes it strikes in its sparse and majestic narrative offer us an orientation to the Torah's entire religious worldview and value system. Creation is taken up first not because the subject has chronological priority but rather to ground basic religious beliefs in {{the very nature of}} things. And I would argue that their power is quite independent of the scientific <b>context</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> were first enunciated.|$|E
25|$|Many sources can be {{considered}} either primary or secondary, depending on the <b>context</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> are used. Moreover, the distinction between primary and secondary sources is subjective and contextual, so that precise definitions are difficult to make. For example, if a historical text discusses old documents to derive a new historical conclusion, it {{is considered to be}} a primary source for the new conclusion, but a secondary source of information found in the old documents. Other examples in which a source can be both primary and secondary include an obituary or a survey of several volumes of a journal counting the frequency of articles on a certain topic.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people with}} {{neurologic}} disorders exhibit uncontrollable episodes of laughing, crying, or both {{that are either}} exaggerated or contradictory to the <b>context</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> occur. Where patients have significant cognitive deficits (e.g., Alzheimer's) it can be unclear whether it is true PBA {{as opposed to a}} grosser form of emotional dysregulation, but patients with intact cognition often report the symptom as disturbing. Patients report that their episodes are at best only partially amenable to voluntary control, and unless they experience a severe change of mental status, they often have insight into their problem and judge their emotional display as inappropriate and out of character. The clinical effect of PBA can be severe, with unremitting and persistent symptoms that can be disabling to patients, and may significantly affect quality of life for caregivers.|$|E

25|$|Monogyne workers kill foreign queens {{and aggressively}} defend their territory. However, not all {{behaviours}} are universal, primarily because worker behaviours {{depend on the}} ecological <b>context</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> develop, and the manipulation of worker genotypes can elicit change in behaviours. Therefore, behaviours of native populations can {{differ from those of}} introduced populations. In a study to assess the aggressive behaviour of monogyne and polygyne red fire ant workers by studying interaction in neutral arenas, and to develop a reliable ethogram for readily distinguishing between monogyne and polygyne colonies of red imported fire ants in the field, monogyne and polygyne workers discriminated between nestmates and foreigners as indicated by different behaviours ranging from tolerance to aggression. Monogyne ants always attacked foreign ants independently if they were from monogyne or polygyne colonies, whereas polygyne ants recognised, but did not attack, foreign polygyne ants, mainly by exhibiting postures similar to behaviours assumed after attacks by Pseudacteon phorids. Hostile versus warning behaviours were strongly dependent on the social structure of workers. Therefore, the behaviour toward foreign workers was a method of characterising monogyne and polygyne colonies. Most colonies in the southeastern and south-central US tend to be monogynous.|$|E
25|$|Platel (2005) defined musical {{semantic}} memory as memory for pieces without memory for the temporal or spatial elements; and musical episodic memory as memory for pieces and the <b>context</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> were learned. It {{was found that}} two distinct patterns of neural activations existed when comparing semantic and episodic components of musical memory. Controlling for processes of early auditory analysis, working memory and mental imagery, Platel found that retrieval of semantic musical memory involved activation in the right inferior and middle frontal gyri, the superior and inferior right temporal gyri, the right anterior cingulate gyrus and parietal lobe region. There was also some activation {{in the middle and}} inferior frontal gyri in the left hemisphere. Retrieval of episodic musical memory resulted in activation bilaterally in the middle and superior frontal gyri and the precuneus. Although bilateral activation was found there was dominance in the right hemisphere. This research suggests independence of episodic and semantic musical memory. The Levitin Effect demonstrates accurate {{semantic memory}} for musical pitch and tempo among listeners, even without musical training, and without episodic memory of the original learning context.|$|E

In this approach, mystical experiences are privatised, separated from the <b>context</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> emerge. Well-known representatives are William James, R.C.

2500|$|This implies {{another level}} of masking, because the {{economic}} character masks are then straightforwardly ("vulgarly") equated with authentic behaviour. The effect in this case is, that the theory of [...] "how the economy works" [...] masks how it actually works, by conflating its surface appearance with its real nature. Its generalities seem to explain it, but in reality they do not. The theory is therefore (ultimately) arbitrary. Either things are studied in isolation from the total <b>context</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> occur, or generalizations are formed which leave essential bits out. Such distortion can certainly be ideologically useful to justify an economic system, position or policy as a good thing, but it can become a hindrance to understanding.|$|E

He also depicted a significant number of black men in his drawings, with no overt racial or political message in the <b>context</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> appear; although they bear some commonality with racist caricatures of the [...] "hypersexual" [...] black male, these traits are shared by Laaksonen's white characters as well.|$|E

2500|$|One of the centerpieces of Marx's {{critique}} of political economy {{is that the}} juridical labour contract between the worker and his capitalist employer obscures the true economic relationship, which is (according to Marx) that the workers do not sell their labor, but their labor power, making possible a profitable difference between what they are paid and the new value they create for the owners of capital (a form of economic exploitation). Thus, the very foundation of capitalist wealth creation involves – as Marx says explicitly – a [...] "mask". More generally, Marx argues that transactions in the capitalist economy are often far from transparent – they appear {{different from what they}} really are. This is discovered, only when one probes the total <b>context</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> occur. Hence Marx writes: ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{process of}} {{structures}} (re)producing systems is called structuration. Systems here mean to Giddens [...] "the situated activities of human agents" [...] (The Constitution of Society.) and [...] "the patterning {{of social relations}} across space-time" [...] (ibid.). Structures are then [...] "...sets of rules and resources that individual actors draw upon in the practices that reproduce social systems’" [...] (Politics, Sociology and Social Theory) and [...] "systems of generative rules and sets, implicated in the articulation of social systems" [...] (The Constitution of Society.), existing virtually [...] "out of time and out of space" [...] (New rules....). Structuration therefore means that relations that took shape in the structure, can exist [...] "out of time and place": in other words, independent of the <b>context</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> are created. An example {{is the relationship between}} a teacher and a student: when they come across each other in another context, say on the street, the hierarchy between them is still preserved.|$|E
