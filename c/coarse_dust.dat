40|$|Mineral dust {{has a large}} {{impact on}} {{regional}} and global climate, depending on its particle size. Especially in the Atlantic Ocean downwind of the Sahara, the largest dust source on earth, the effects can be substantial but are poorly understood. This study focuses on seasonal and spatial variations in particle size of Saharan dust deposition across the Atlantic Ocean, using an array of submarine sediment traps moored along a transect at 12 ° N. We show that the particle size decreases downwind with increased distance from the Saharan source, due to higher gravitational settling velocities of coarse particles in the atmosphere. Modal grain sizes vary between 4 and 32  µm throughout the different seasons and at five locations along the transect. This is much coarser than previously suggested and incorporated into climate models. In addition, seasonal changes are prominent, with <b>coarser</b> <b>dust</b> in summer and finer dust in winter and spring. Such seasonal changes are caused by transport at higher altitudes and at greater wind velocities during summer than in winter. Also, the latitudinal migration of the dust cloud, associated with the Intertropical Convergence Zone, causes seasonal differences in deposition as the summer dust cloud is located more {{to the north and}} more directly above the sampled transect. Furthermore, increased precipitation and more frequent dust storms in summer coincide with <b>coarser</b> <b>dust</b> deposition. Our findings contribute to understanding Saharan dust transport and deposition relevant for the interpretation of sedimentary records for climate reconstructions, as well as for global and regional models for improved prediction of future climate...|$|R

Assessing this large size range may be possible using real-time cloud and aerosol spectrometer (CAS) light-scattering measurements.

40|$|The dust {{generated}} from mining {{activities in the}} mining area is an important environmental issue for modern mining industries with many environmental problems involved. Number of researcher worked on small dust particle transport, but few work related to the <b>coarser</b> <b>dust</b> particles with 10 to 100 micro meters diameters had been made {{despite the fact that}} <b>coarser</b> <b>dust</b> transport have significant influence on the human lives (e. g. dust deposit on the residential area nearby, and mining facilities which may bring commercial and safety problem to the people living close by and the mine operators). More complaints from the residents and the workers deserve such research work. The research on dust transport is aiming to track how dust transport and deposit around the mining area and its interrelationship with local climate and topographic conditions. The modeling work is based on some fluid sediment transport dynamic models, with 1 D, 2 D and 3 D when the research steps go further on. The models illustrate the transport progress and the amount transported by the wind. A case study from Malmberget mine in northern Sweden has been made in 2010. The dust characteristic information was obtained from laboratory work in LTU, and local climate information was supplied by the SMHI (Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute). Two transport models were developed and applied here: One is the computational model based upon the classical Bagnold’s (1941) equation; and the other one is the simulation model based upon the sedimentation engineering work from Al-Ansari (1976). The computational model calculates dust retention time for estimating the amount of dust transport in certain time period with provided wind and dust characteristic information. The simulation model used simple sediment transport model to simulate the dust grain movement in air flow, and conclude the transport amount of dust. Both models were enhanced by Matlab GUI to simplify the calculation procedure. The comparison of the results from the two models gave the similar variations and estimation of the transport amount for the given data. With more modification methods the models are expected to be more accurate. The application of the model is aiming to be enlarged to snow particles with changed criteria, 2 D and 3 D models would be designed in the future work to obtain the better results.

30|$|Some {{researchers}} have left aside {{the complexities of}} aesthetic judgement, and have concentrated on the limits on the perception of soiling. Bellan et al. [60] have measured the human eye ability to detect soot deposition on flat, plain colour surfaces using printed dots (60 - 160 μm) on white and coloured matte surfaces. Their results show that some observers are able to discern a soiled surface from a clean one when the covered area is just a bit higher than 1 % of the total, and that deposition becomes obvious to all at around 9 % coverage. The perceptive ability is improved if the soiled surface is observed alongside a clean one, in which case all observers identify soiling when just 3.5 % of the area is covered. Experiments with larger dots (0.5 - 1 mm) {{have led to a}} threshold of 0.2 % area coverage [102].

40|$|We {{present the}} {{development}} of the adjoint of a physically based cirrus formation parameterization that computes the sensitivity of formed crystal number concentration to numerous model variables (e. g., updraft velocity, soluble aerosol geometric mean diameter and number concentration, insoluble aerosol geometric mean diameter and number concentration, and ice deposition coefficient). The adjoint is demonstrated in the CESM Community Atmosphere Model Version 5. 1, where sensitivity information is computed and used to quantify which variables are most responsible for modeled variability in formed crystal number concentration. The sensitivity of formed crystal number concentration to updraft velocity is positive and largest over the tropics where regions of deep convection are collocated with large sulfate number concentrations. Sensitivity to sulfate number concentration is largest over the tropics where updraft cooling is sufficient and sulfate number concentration is low, pointing to a sulfate limited regime. Outside of the tropics, crystal production is dominated by heterogeneous freezing; unexpectedly, sensitivities to insoluble aerosol number concentration for accumulation and <b>coarse</b> mode <b>dust,</b> black carbon, and organic carbon are negative in sign here. This is a result of infrequent, anomalously high updraft velocity events causing shifts in the dominant modes of freezing which act to bias sensitivity information when annually averaged. Updraft velocity is responsible for ~ 95 % of the variability in formed crystal number concentration in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. In the tropics, sulfate number concentration controls variability in formed crystal number concentration since crystal production here is sulfate limited. Insoluble aerosol species play a secondary role in influencing the variability of crystal concentrations; <b>coarse</b> mode <b>dust</b> is the largest contributor to crystal number variability at nearly 60 %, although the spatial extent of this influence is small and concentrated over highly localized dust events. When globally averaged, nearly 90 % of the variability in crystal number concentration can be described by only updraft velocity, sulfate number, temperature, and <b>coarse</b> mode <b>dust</b> number concentration. Although these results depend on parameter assumptions, the robustness of the underlying physics of the cirrus formation parameterization used throughout this work suggests that this approach can be a powerful method for efficiently identifying the origin of microphysical dependencies within large scale atmospheric simulations.

30|$|Dust {{deposition}} {{is among}} the top subjects of concern to have attracted the conservation scientists’ attention with increasing concern lately [8, 9]. Indeed, particulate matter (PM) can be hazardous to fragile works of art in multiple ways. First of all, dust affects aesthetic quality through a phenomenon called soiling. It {{can be caused by}} soot and calcite particles [10] that settle in layers, thus hindering the reading of the artefact. Fine particles can penetrate through cracks [4, 11], <b>coarse</b> <b>dust</b> can cement under particular relative humidity (RH) conditions [12], making cleaning operations difficult. Furthermore, PM deposition causes and catalyses physical and chemical degradations: <b>coarse</b> <b>dust</b> abrades surfaces [4], sulphur-rich particles discolour pigments or bloom on varnishes [13], alkaline aerosols speed up cellulose degradation [14]. Dust layers also form an attractive environment for mould and insects [15]. These conservation concerns are major ones and even more so as the artefact is precious and fragile.|$|E
