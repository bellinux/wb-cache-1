50|$|The book {{spans the}} years 1805 through 1925. Initially Protestants and Catholics both {{supported}} {{the establishment of}} public schools, but a rise in nativism, activism to use the King James Bible, preferred by Protestants, caused the cooperation to collapse. By the 1880s immigrant Catholics established their own school system {{in response to these}} social <b>changes.</b> <b>The</b> Catholics <b>believed</b> that education according to their faith was crucial and that the family had the responsibility of their children's education rather than the government. The author discusses the differences in Catholic schools in different parishes. The book discusses how there was overall less anti-Catholic sentiment and more inter-denominational cooperation in Detroit compared to other American cities. The later parts of the book document a failed Ku Klux Klan attempt to abolish Catholic schools by state constitutional amendment.|$|R
