It is therefore likely that Urbicus led the reoccupation of southern Scotland , probably using the 2nd Augustan Legion. He evidently campaigned against several British tribes (possibly including factions of the northern Brigantes), certainly against the lowland tribes of Scotland, the Votadini and Selgovae of the Scottish Borders region, and the Damnonii of Strathclyde.

The Invasion of French Indochina on 22 September 1940 (which by then {{was controlled by}} the collaborating government of Vichy France), and Japan's ongoing bloody conflict with China, put a severe strain on American-Japanese relations. On 26 July 1940, the United States had passed the Export Control Act, cutting oil, iron and steel exports to Japan. This <b>containment</b> <b>policy</b> was Washington's warning to Japan that any further military expansion would result in further sanctions.

40|$|During {{the past}} several decades, most U. S. {{metropolitan}} areas have experienced strong suburbanization of housing and jobs (i. e., urban sprawl). The sprawl that arises from urban growth has become a big issue in many metropolitan areas in the U. S. In response, there has been increased interest in urban <b>containment</b> <b>policies.</b> There are contrasting views (planning-oriented vs. market-oriented) of urban sprawl and urban <b>containment</b> <b>policies.</b> Planning-oriented scholars asserted the problems of 2 ̆ 7 geographic sprawl (GS) 2 ̆ 7 and {{the positive effects of}} urban containment polices, while market-oriented scholars asserted the problems of 2 ̆ 7 economic sprawl (ES) 2 ̆ 7 and the negative or negligible effects of urban <b>containment</b> <b>policies.</b> Therefore, this dissertation analyzed whether urban <b>containment</b> <b>policies</b> affect urban sprawl, employment center formation, and urban commuting. The results of this dissertation indicate that urban <b>containment</b> <b>policies</b> {{play an important role in}} affecting urban sprawl, employment center formation, and urban commuting, as well as explaining the contrasting views (planning-oriented vs. market-oriented) of urban <b>containment</b> <b>policies.</b> Implementing urban <b>containment</b> <b>policies</b> can produce positive effects such as compact development, which can promote J-H balance.

40|$|Background: Urban <b>containment</b> <b>policies</b> {{attempt to}} manage the location, character, and timing of growth to support a variety of goals such as compact development, {{preservation}} of greenspace, and efficient use of infrastructure. Despite prior research evaluating the effects of urban <b>containment</b> <b>policies</b> on land use, housing, and transportation outcomes, the public health implications of these policies remain unexplored. This ecologic study examines relationships among urban <b>containment</b> <b>policies,</b> state adoption of growthmanagement legislation, and population levels of leisure and transportation-related physical activity in 63 large metropolitan statistical areas from 1990 to 2002. Methods: Multiple data sources were combined, including surveys of urban <b>containment</b> <b>policies,</b> the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, the U. S. Census of Population, the National Resources Inventory, and the Texas Transportation Institute Urban Mobility Study. Mixed models were used to examine whether urban <b>containment</b> <b>policies</b> and state adoption of growth-management legislation were associated with population levels of leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) and walking/bicycling to work over time. Results: Strong urban <b>containment</b> <b>policies</b> were associated with higher population levels of LTPA and walking/bicycling to work during the study period. Additionally, residents of states with legislation mandating urban growth boundaries reported significantly more minutes of LTPA/week compared to residents of states without such <b>policies.</b> Weak urban <b>containment</b> <b>policies</b> showed inconsistent relationships with physical activity. Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence that strong urban <b>containment</b> <b>policies</b> are associated with higher population levels of LTPA and active commuting. Future research should examine potential synergies among state, metropolitan, and local policy processes that may strengthen these relationship...|$|R

An {{agreement between the}} ambassadors of Malaysia and Vietnam was reached in 1975. The following year, Malaysia first opened its embassy in Hanoi, while Vietnam also opened its embassy in Kuala Lumpur on 29 May 1976. In {{the mid to late}} 1970s, bilateral ties were strained as Malaysia pressured Vietnam to embrace the ZOPFAN concept, which the latter interpreted as a version of the anti-communist <b>containment</b> <b>policy.</b> During a bilateral summit in August 1977, Malaysia's Prime Minister Hussein Onn made promises to provide economic and technical assistance to rebuild Vietnam's war-torn economy. When Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1979, many Vietnamese sought refuge in Malaysia from that time onwards and into the 1980s, and caused economic and national security problems to Malaysia especially to its racial balance as most the Vietnamese refugees resemble the Chinese people. Bilateral ties normalised from 1988 onwards, when Vietnam announced plans to withdraw from Cambodia. In the early 1990s, government leaders of both countries held several diplomatic visits and summits, which produced many agreements that emphasised economic co-operation and development. Strengthening ties also saw the opening of a consulate office in Ho Chi Minh City in January 1991. Vietnam expressed its interest in joining ASEAN with Malaysia's support in 1994 as the countries continued to foster close economic ties.

US President Harry S.

25|$|However, the {{collapse}} of the North Korean regime and unification by Seoul would also present a number of problems for China. A sudden and violent collapse might cause a mass exodus of North Koreans fleeing or fighting poverty into China, causing a humanitarian crisis that could destabilize northeast China. The movement of South Korean and American soldiers into the North could result in their being temporarily or even permanently stationed on China's border, seen as a potential threat to Chinese sovereignty and an imposition of a China <b>containment</b> <b>policy.</b> A unified Korea could also more strongly pursue its territorial disputes with China and might inflame nationalism among Koreans in China. Some have claimed the existence of contingency plans for China intervening in situations of great turmoil in North Korea (with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Northeast Project on the Chinese identity of the Goguryeo kingdom potentially used to justify intervention or even annexation).|$|E
25|$|The {{war started}} badly for the US and UN. North Korean forces struck massively {{in the summer}} of 1950 and nearly drove the outnumbered US and ROK {{defenders}} into the sea. However the United Nations intervened, naming Douglas MacArthur commander of its forces, and UN-US-ROK forces held a perimeter around Pusan, gaining time for reinforcement. MacArthur, in a bold but risky move, ordered an amphibious invasion well behind the front lines at Inchon, cutting off and routing the North Koreans and quickly crossing the 38th Parallel into North Korea. As UN forces continued to advance toward the Yalu River on the border with Communist China, the Chinese crossed the Yalu River in October and launched a series of surprise attacks that sent the UN forces reeling back across the 38th Parallel. Truman originally wanted a Rollback strategy to unify Korea; after the Chinese successes he settled for a <b>Containment</b> <b>policy</b> to split the country. MacArthur argued for rollback but was fired by President Harry Truman after disputes over the conduct of the war. Peace negotiations dragged on for two years until President Dwight D. Eisenhower threatened China with nuclear weapons; an armistice was quickly reached with the two Koreas remaining divided at the 38th parallel. North and South Korea are still today in a state of war, having never signed a peace treaty, and American forces remain stationed in South Korea as part of American foreign policy.|$|E
40|$|Background Despite {{the large}} volume of public effort devoted to {{restrain}} drug supply and the growing attention given to drug demand reduction policies, the use of cocaine and heroin remains steady. Furthermore, retail drug prices have fallen significantly in Europe and the US. This puzzling evidence leads us to develop a model aiming at systematically analysing illicit drug markets. Methods We model the markets of cocaine and heroin from production to the final retail markets. One novelty of the analysis consists in characterising the retail market as a monopolistic competitive one. Then, upper level dealers have some market power in the retail market. This allows them to charge a markup and to earn extra profits. These extra profits attract newcomers so that profits tend to fall over time. Results Theoretical model was used to analyse the effect of supply <b>containment</b> <b>policies</b> on the retail market, the producer market and the export–import business. This introduces {{the discussion of the}} impact of demand reduction policies on the high level traffickers’ profit. Finally, globalisation enters in the model. Conclusions Law enforcement measures increase the risk premia received by the lower and higher level traffickers. Consequently, trafficking intermediation margins tend to increase. However, globalisation has the opposite effect. It lowers intermediation margins and, then, pushes retail prices down, thereby stimulating consumption. In doing so, globalisation offsets the effects of supply <b>containment</b> <b>policies.</b> Finally, we discuss how the effectiveness of supply <b>containment</b> <b>policies</b> can be enhanced by combining them with demand reduction policies...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effectiveness of}} urban <b>containment</b> <b>policies</b> to protect forestland from residential conversion and to increase the provision of forest public goods {{in the presence of}} irreversible investments and policy uncertainty. We develop a model of a single landowner that allows for switching between competing land uses (forestry and residential use) {{at some point in the}} future. Our results show that urban <b>containment</b> <b>policies</b> can protect (even if temporarily) forestland from being developed but must be supplemented with policies that influence the length and number of harvesting cycles if the goal is to increase nontimber benefits. The threat of a development prohibition creates incentives for preemptive timber harvesting and land conversion. In particular, threatened regulation creates an incentive to shorten rotation cycles to avoid costly land-use restrictions. However, it has an ambiguous effect on forestland conversion as the number of rotation cycles can also be adjusted to maximize the expected returns to land. Finally, in the presence of irreversibility, forestland conversion decisions should be done using real option theory rather than net present value analysi...|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} of urban <b>containment</b> <b>policies</b> is increasingly attracting attention in environment management. Rapid urban {{growth and the}} coexistence of decentralisation and marketisation challenge containment strategies that are implemented to control urban sprawl. This challenge {{is likely to be}} greater in a transformation country than in developed countries. This paper evaluates the performance of containment strategies in Beijing. The analysis shows that, to a large extent, containment strategies perform well; however, the decreased compactness of the fringes of the inter-suburban areas, caused by dispersed and illegal development, suggest that municipal containment strategies are being challenged by new trends towards local autonomy. Two similar dilemmas to those faced by developed countries are confronting those involved in the {{implementation of}} containment strategies in the current transformation process in Beijing: first, the municipal environmental goal might not be achieved by all local jurisdictions when local economic motivations are involved; and second, macro-scale <b>containment</b> <b>policies</b> are unlikely to control an urban sprawl fuelled by the growing power of market forces. containment strategies, urban sprawl, transformation, environment management, Beijing,...|$|R

We distinguish four primary targets to contain costs: volume controls, price controls, budgeting and market oriented policies. Price controls and budgeting, both seen as relatively effective, appear substantially less often in literature than volume controls and market oriented policies.
