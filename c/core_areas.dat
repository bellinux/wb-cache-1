5|$|By 1591, {{the king}} of Jaffna Ethirimanna Cinkam was {{installed}} by the Portuguese. Although he was nominally a client, he resisted missionary activities and helped the interior Kandyan kingdom in its quest to get military help from South India. Eventually, a usurper named Cankili II, resisted Portuguese overlordship only to find himself ousted and hanged by Phillippe de Oliveira in 1619. The subsequent rule by the Portuguese saw the population convert to Roman Catholicism. The population also decreased due to excessive taxation, as most people fled the <b>core</b> <b>areas</b> of the former kingdom.|$|E
5|$|In Spain, the red-billed chough has {{recently}} expanded its range by utilising old buildings, with 1,175 breeding pairs in a mi) study area. These new breeding areas usually surround the original montane <b>core</b> <b>areas.</b> However, the populations with nest sites on buildings {{are threatened by}} human disturbance, persecution {{and the loss of}} old buildings. Fossils of both chough species were found in the mountains of the Canary Islands. The local extinction of the Alpine chough and the reduced range of red-billed chough in the islands may have been due to climate change or human activity.|$|E

Highway 146 (Bayport Blvd.) is a coastal highway linking the waterfronts of the communities. The Gulf Freeway and Bayport Blvd. {{together}} are the main arteries linking the Clear Lake Area communities and Pasadena, though Highway 225, East Beltway 8, Highway 3 and others are important as well. The Fred Hartman Bridge on Highway 146 crosses the ship channel connecting Baytown and La Porte, while the Galveston Causeway on the Gulf Freeway crosses the bay connecting Texas City and Galveston Island.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} social {{differences}} {{between males and}} females. Females typically have many affiliates and bond strongly with other females {{both within and outside}} their <b>core</b> <b>areas,</b> but do not affiliate with individuals outside the community range, except during mating season. Males, on the other hand, are more solitary, interact with only a couple of conspecifics, have weak social bonds with other males, and rarely associate with others outside their core group. Furthermore, field studies suggest that only females play a role in communal home range defense. Males may scent-mark and remain relatively silent, but otherwise show little involvement during disputes.|$|E
5|$|Both species {{usually are}} solitary foragers, {{although}} the northern giant mouse lemur {{tends to be}} the most social, possibly due to its higher population density. Up to eight (typically four) adult males, adult females, and juveniles may be found in a northern giant mouse lemur nest, whereas Coquerel's giant mouse lemurs do not nest communally, except when females share their nest with their offspring. Males do groom and call to females when they come into contact, and according to radio-tracking and direct observations at Analabe near Kirindy, they form pair bonds, sometimes briefly traveling together during the dry season. However, most interactions between adults are infrequent and typically occur later at night and particularly during the dry season in overlapping <b>core</b> <b>areas,</b> often involving chases and other agonistic behavior, and only rarely social grooming. During the mating season, males act aggressively towards one another, pulling out fur around the head and shoulders and biting the head.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Resolution [Ordinance] is to foster and {{strengthen}} economic vitality in the local jurisdiction’s downtown <b>core</b> <b>area</b> while respecting and enhancing the special character of the existing development in the downtown <b>core</b> <b>area.</b> The downtown <b>core</b> <b>area</b> is a compact assembly of storefront buildings, short walkable blocks, mixed uses, pedestrian amenities, and consolidated on- and off-street parking. The community’s downtown core character is especially vulnerable to intrusion from incompatible uses and physical development practices. The city’s downtown is so important and significant to the city, that it justifies a special set of regulations designed to protect and enhance its character in light of new development. The potential to impact existing development is much less {{in other areas of}} the community than in the downtown <b>core</b> <b>area,</b> and hence the regulations outside the downtown <b>core</b> <b>area</b> do not merit the same protection. The {{purpose of this}} Resolution [Ordinance] is to establish requirements for building and site design for new developments and for the significant modification of existing developments within the designated downtown <b>core</b> <b>area.</b> This Resolution [Ordinance] is intended to protect the existing character of the downtown and encourage orderly development in accordance with the comprehensive plan for the city and with a study and specific plan for the downtown <b>core</b> <b>area.</b> The following principles serve as the foundation for the Downtow...|$|R

5|$|In a {{study done}} at Masoala Peninsula on red ruffed lemurs three levels of {{organization}} were identified and defined: communities, core groups, and subgroups. Communities are individuals that affiliated regularly with each other, but rarely with conspecifics outside of the community. Although the entire multi-male/multi-female community lives within a discrete home range, all individuals are never seen in the same location at the same time. Instead, individuals form dispersed social networks, known as core groups, within the community. Core groups are individuals that shared the same core area within a community territory throughout the year. Core groups typically consist of two reproductive females, as well as reproductive males and subadults, {{ranging in size from}} two individuals to nine. Females within the groups are cooperative, but male encounters are often agonistic. Subgroups, on the other hand, vary daily in size, composition, and duration, and consist of associated individuals from either the same core group or different core groups, depending on the season. It is from the consistent, daily changes in these subgroups that occur throughout the year, as well as the seasonal formations of core groups in <b>core</b> <b>areas,</b> that demonstrate the fission-fusion nature of ruffed lemur social structure.|$|E
