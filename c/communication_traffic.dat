The method is useful especially in mobile-IP or VPN environment, a popular technology for mobile computers, where the most part of <b>communication</b> <b>traffics</b> flows be-tween the mobile computer and a specific host. We also propose and evaluate a technique of measuring the bandwidth of communication path between specific two hosts. The technique, based on the packet-pair algo-rithm, measures the bandwidth {{on both sides of the}} path. It requires small amount of traffics and takes short time to measure.

40|$|Abstract: Cell {{adhesion}} molecules {{provide the}} foundation for cell <b>communication,</b> <b>trafficking,</b> and immune surveillance central to host defense. These adhesion molecules which include selectins, integrins {{and members of the}} Ig superfamily, provide a recog-nition system between leukocytes, endothelial cells and matrix molecules. Leukocyte-endothelial inter-actions initiate recruitment at sites of injury, infec-tion and inflammation. Cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions also influence leukocyte phenotype and function. Dysregulation of these adhesion and signal transduction pathways can contribute to continued recruitment and persistent leukocyte activation with unresolved inflammation. Based on the pivotal roleS adhesive interactions play, the adhesion molecules provide potential targets for intervention. Selected synthetic fibronectin peptides, which inhibit leuko-cyte integrin binding and signal transduction in vitro, block recruitment and activation to limit inflamma-tion in vivo. J. Leukoc.

50|$|With {{the spread}} use of {{distributed}} object-oriented systems like CORBA, client-side use of Java and weaknesses in mail readers {{and the like}} {{there is a wide}} variety of threats residing in the application and intermediate level of <b>communication</b> <b>traffic.</b> Firewall mechanisms at the perimeter can come useful by inspecting incoming e-mails for known malicious code fingerprints, but can be confronted with complex, thus resource-consuming situations when making decisions on other code, like Java.Using the framework of a distributed firewall and especially considering a policy language which allows for policy decision on the application level can circumvent some of these problems, under the condition that contents of such communication packets can be interpreted semantically by the policy verifying mechanisms. Stateful inspection of packets shows up to be easily adapted to these requirements and allows for finer granularity in decision making. Furthermore, malicious code contents may be completely disguised to the screening unit at the network perimeter, given the use of virtual private networks and enciphered <b>communication</b> <b>traffic</b> in general and can completely disable such policy enforcement on conventional firewalls.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{features}} offered exclusively on G-Book mX is Probe <b>Communication</b> <b>Traffic</b> Information. According to the press release from Toyota dated April 10, 2007, [...] "This unique Toyota traffic information service gathers driving data - such as speed and position - from vehicles equipped with G-Book mX to provide drivers with alternate routes for avoiding traffic congestion. Because it makes use of the on-board DCM (data communications module), the information gathering capability of this service is superior to similar systems, which rely solely on cell phones, and efficiently stores information about traffic congestion in real time at the G-Book Center. In this way the Probe <b>Communication</b> <b>Traffic</b> Information service supplements Vehicle Information and Communication System (VICS) information with updates on traffic congestion, providing drivers with highly accurate predictions about the current traffic situation and suggestions for the best alternate routes to take." [...] This feature is being marketed as an ability to drive eco-friendly, by helping to avoid pollution created by cars idling in traffic and allowing the driver to reach their destination sooner, and affording the opportunity to turn the car off, limiting emissions being added to the atmosphere.|$|E

The break disrupted 75% of communication between the Middle East and Asia {{and the rest of}} the world. The breaks caused companies including Vodafone, Verizon Communications, Portugal Telecom, GO (Malta) and France Telecom to experience disruption in their systems and forced them to reroute communications through different means. Others, such as AT&T, also received reports of service disruption. The rerouting of these communications caused large slowdowns in some areas. Interoute director Jonathan Wright stated that [...] "You can reroute the data through other cables, but that increases traffic and can potentially create bottlenecks, so Internet connections may slow down and some phone calls could get disrupted." [...] The GO-1 cable connecting Malta and Sicily was also cut.|$|E
5000|$|Pers Z S was the the {{civilian}} Signal Intelligence Agency of the German Foreign Office. Pers Z S believed {{it has a}} monopoly on diplomatic <b>communication</b> <b>traffic</b> and was also a rival to Reichswehr Cipher bureau. It dealt specifically with diplomatic ciphers and relied on the German Post Office for diplomatic intercepts, who transmitted and received the encrypted communications from embassies located in Germany, and across the world. The post service routinely retained copies of all embassy messages and passed the messages to Per Z S cryptanalysts for study and the Post Office only dealt with the Foreign Ministry. Fenner argued that OKW/Chi needed diplomatic traffic as they included information of military interest and military analysts {{were more likely to}} identify such items in messages and understand their significance. He convinced his opposite number in the foreign office ministry Kurt Selchow, that cooperation would benefit both units. Specifically, he promised Selchow that as the OKW/Chi expanded and improved its radio monitoring network, the foreign ministry cryptanalysts would have access to all diplomatic messages intercepted. Fenner also offered access to share other OKW/Chi materials and results. The result of the inter-agency collaboration was considered rare in a normally hostile and competitive German intelligence community.|$|E
