50|$|The Housing Commission of Victoria was {{established}} under the Housing Act 1937 to improve existing housing conditions {{and to provide}} adequate housing for persons of limited means; the Slum Reclamation Act 1938 and the Reclamation and Housing (Financial) Act 1938 provided the framework for the Commission's work. On {{the passing of the}} legislation, the Victorian Premier, Albert Dunstan, declared the beginning of the Commission's activities as a 'war on slums', but also recognised the magnitude of the task before it. The legislation not only gave the <b>Commission</b> <b>powers</b> for housing construction and improvement, but also made it 'a planning authority in its own right'. The Commission's chief concerns however, were the 'slum pockets' which required 'excision' for the 'common good'. The Commission developed a plan of action in March 1938, concentrating its attention on 1,240 houses in lanes, rights-of-way and slum pockets, referred to in HISAB's earlier report. Slums were to be reclaimed and people rehoused.|$|E

40|$|Research PaperThe {{failure of}} the European Union’s Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) to develop a {{sustainable}} fishing environment for all member states is often blamed on the incompatibility of the territorial logic of national interests and the market forces of a de-territorialized European Union. Ironically, {{it is precisely this}} incompatibility that a common approach sought to overcome. This policy attempts to address scientific, market and socio-economic concerns within a shared state-led policymaking arena. Within this arena, the Commission’s institutional significance as initiator of conservation regulations and overseer of policy implementation has often been derided within the literature. A small policing budget and a Council populated by logrolling preference outliers only add to the perception that the Commission’s authority lacks any real teeth. This view neglects to consider the evolution of <b>Commission</b> <b>powers</b> in relation to ministers’ preferences for decision-making autonomy over the policy’s history. When these powers are seen in this light it becomes clear that both ‘push’ factors from the Council and ‘pull’ factors from the Commission are altering the institutional balance within this arena. This paper considers how Total Allowable Catch determination has evolved and puts the Commission’s increasing use of emergency legislation into the context of this institutional evolution...|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{analysis of}} the European Commission's general role in supervising member state compliance with EU law, this book provides a detailed assessment of centralized EU enforcement. It starts out by asking whether it is viable to establish stronger <b>Commission</b> <b>powers</b> of enforcement {{at this point in}} time. Against this backdrop, and as a means of exploring the role of the Commission, the chapters examine a number of different aspects pertaining to enforcement of EU law. Beginning with an appraisal of the Commission's function under the general EU infringement procedure stipulated in Articles 258 and 260 TFEU, the volume argues that the EU lacks independent self-sustained regime authority. Moreover, this is reflected in both substantive EU law and procedural law, including the general EU infringement procedure. Chapter two makes the case that Article 258 TFEU can usefully be explained in terms of managerialism. Chapter three analyses Article 260 TFEU concerning repetitive infringements. In particular, it asserts, EU member state sanctions sustain the managerial approach. It then goes on to examine the Commission's unsuccessful attempts to gain sharper enforcement powers through secondary legislation, and identifies the effective points of functional overlap between enforcement powers and certain types of implementing tools. Finally, it discusses the Commission's role under various non-binding, ad hoc arrangements. The concluding chapter places the general EU infringement procedure in the broader context of a comprehensive (negotiated) policy process. It argues that the enforcement stage shares many features with earlier steps in the legislative process, including flexibility and deliberation. •	Introduction •	 1 : The Commission's General Powers of Enforcement •	 2 : Failure to Comply with EU Law: Article 258 TFEU •	 3 : Failure to Comply with a Judgement of the Court: Article 260 TFEU •	 4 : The Commission's Quest for Stronger Powers of Enforcement •	 5 : The Functional Overlap of Enforcement and Implementation Tools •	 6 : The Emergence of Non-Binding, Auxiliary Enforcement Procedures: Expert Management of Compliance with Directives •	 7 : The Commission's Enforcement Powers in Context •	BibliographyPublished version of EUI PhD thesis, 200...|$|E

40|$|The Treaty of Lisbon (TFEU) {{significantly}} {{changes the}} {{theory and practice of}} the delegation of executive powers to the European <b>Commission,</b> <b>powers</b> which resulted in 14, 522 legally binding implementing measures during the sixth legislature under the Barroso I Commission (2004 - 2009) (in comparison to only 454 legislative acts). The Treaty of Lisbon fundamentally alters the way this system works, and in turn the way everyone works with it, especially European and national public administrations. From obscure and informal beginnings in the field of purely technical agricultural markets in the 1960 s, the Lisbon Treaty has in fact made the so-called ‘comitology’ system (and the name) partially redundant. Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December 2009, there are now two new legal bases; Delegated Acts (Article 290) and Implementing Acts (Article 291). This means that the ‘comitology’ world has been split into two. The new system makes a clear separation between tasks delegated to the Commission that only require pure implementation, Implementing Acts, and those that allow the Commission to amend, supplement or delete non-essential elements of the legislative act, Delegated Acts. The main changes in the Lisbon system are related to this new category of Delegated Acts, where committees cease to exist and the legislators have equal rights to object to individual Delegated Acts or even to revoke the delegation to the Commission altogether. Under this new situation the Parliament thus stands on an equal footing with the Council. The implications of these changes are considerable, in both practical and political terms, and therefore require serious attention from the EU institutions, Member States, and outside stakeholders. This short article attempts to address the key changes and questions. Based on the institutions’ Common Understanding on Delegated Acts and the new ‘Comitology’ Regulation 182 / 2011 /EU, which entered into force on 1 March 2011, we present the two new avenues and highlight all the important changes. We conclude with our considerations of the practical implications of the new Lisbon system for European and national public administrations...|$|E
