40|$|In August 2009, {{a blowout}} of the Montara H 1 well 260 km off the {{northwest}} coast of Australia {{resulted in the}} uncontrolled release of about 4. 7 M L of light <b>crude</b> oil and <b>gaseous</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> into the Timor Sea. Over the 74 day period of the spill, the oil remained offshore and {{did not result in}} shoreline incidents on the Australia mainland. At various times slicks were sighted over a 90, 000 km 2 area, forming a layer of oil which was tracked by airplanes and satellites but the slicks typically remained within 35 km of the wellhead platform and were treated with 183, 000 L of dispersants. The shelf area where the spill occurred is shallow (100 - 200 m) and includes off shore emergent reefs and cays and submerged banks and shoals. This study describes the increased inputs of oil to the system and assesses the environmental impact. Concentrations of hydrocarbon in the sediment at the time of survey were very low (total aromatic hydrocarbons(PAHs) ranged from 0. 04 to 31 ng g- 1) and were orders of magnitude lower than concentrations at which biological effects would be expected...|$|R

40|$|The {{pyrolysis}} of <b>gaseous</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> {{is discussed}} an {{the basis of}} the so-called 'droplet-' or'agglomerate-model'. This quantitativemechanism describes the formation of pyrocarbon by the four foilowing steps: 1.

The formation of nuclei is favored by enrichment of the gasphase with carbonaceous species. 3. These nuclei can grow by the capture of other molecules or species, thus forming agglomerates. 4.

As a consequence of this model the physical properties of the resulting pyrocarbon layers are mainly influenced by the morphology of the agglomerates.

40|$|It is {{important}} to look at converting methane into larger molecular weight hydrocarbons because the worlds 2 ̆ 7 supply of natural gas {{is equivalent to the}} worlds 2 ̆ 7 crude oil reserves. There are known processes such as the Fischer Tropsch process that can convert methane into larger molecular weight hydrocarbons but this process and other known processes are generally multistep processes. The study of using methane plasmas to produce larger molecular weight hydrocarbons {{is important}} because the plasma process converts methane to larger molecular weight hydrocarbons in a single step. ^ A methane plasma can produce liquid, polymeric, and <b>gaseous</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> products. Previous plasma research has focused on characterizing only one product. In this study all the products that form in a methane plasma in both a microwave plasma and in a tubular dielectric barrier discharge reactor were studied. A new sampling system was developed for the microwave plasma system to better determine product selectivity and conversion. ^ Using the new sampling system the overall conversion of methane in both plasma systems could be modeled as a zero order plug flow reactor. The reaction rate constant was modified to be dependent on pressure and voltage or power. The modifications to the reaction rate constants were consistent with Huang and Suib. ^ Previous plasma studies reported either acetylene or ethane as the most abundant <b>gaseous</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> product. Only one person has been able to produce either ethane or acetylene as the most abundant <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>gaseous</b> product. The microwave plasma system was able to produce either acetylene or ethane as the most abundant <b>gaseous</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> product. The specific energy (kJ/mole) of methane was important in determining whether ethane or acetylene is the most abundant <b>gaseous</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> product. ^ In microwave systems, high surface area catalysts have been used to convert methane into larger hydrocarbons. In the tubular reactor the electrode was coated with different metals and even though the electrode had a relatively low surface area catalytic affects have been reported for water splitting, CO 2 decomposition, and NO reduction. By studying all the products and reactor conditions the specific energy of the tubular reactor was reduced to prevent polymer formation so that a catalytic effect was found with methane by using electrodes of different metals. A catalytic cycle was also demonstrated in the plasma system, which no plasma catalyst study had ever reported. ...|$|R
