5|$|Gliders {{are often}} {{launched}} using a stationary ground-based winch {{mounted on a}} heavy vehicle. This method is widely used at many European clubs, often {{in addition to an}} aerotow service. The engine is usually powered by LPG, petrol or diesel, though hydraulic fluid engines and electrical motors are also used. The winch pulls in a 1,000 to 2,500-metre (3,000 to 7,500ft) cable, made of high-tensile steel wire or a synthetic fiber, attached to the glider. The cable is released at a height of about 35% of the <b>cable</b> <b>length</b> after a short, steep ride. A strong headwind will result in higher launches.|$|E
5|$|The IEEE 802.3af Power over Ethernet (PoE) {{standard}} specifies a {{more elaborate}} power negotiation scheme than powered USB. It operates at 48VDC and can supply more power (up to 12.95W, PoE+ 25.5W) over a cable up to 100meters compared to USB2.0, which provides 2.5W {{with a maximum}} <b>cable</b> <b>length</b> of 5meters. This has made PoE popular for VoIP telephones, security cameras, wireless access points, and other networked devices within buildings. However, USB is cheaper than PoE provided that the distance is short and power demand is low.|$|E

500|$|USB2.0 {{provides}} for a maximum <b>cable</b> <b>length</b> of [...] for devices running at high speed (480Mbit/s). The primary reason for this limit is the maximum allowed round-trip delay of about 1.5μs. If USB host commands are unanswered by the USB device within the allowed time, the host considers the command lost. When adding USB device response time, delays from {{the maximum number of}} hubs added to the delays from connecting cables, the maximum acceptable delay per cable amounts to 26ns. The USB2.0 specification requires that cable delay be less than 5.2ns per meter ( [...] , [...] - which is close to the maximum achievable transmission speed for standard copper wire).|$|E
500|$|The {{engineering}} of the masts {{was complicated}} because stability {{was so important}} to the overall design success of the suspension structure. [...] Mast displacements could significantly alter <b>cable</b> <b>length</b> and tension and redistribute loads through the superstructure contrary to design. [...] The key to successful design was control of the foundation settlement. [...] The sites natural underlying subsurface conditions were stiff silty clay below a medium dense sand layer, which was determined to be too accommodating to settlement to host the structure. [...] Ground improvement, consisting of triple-fluid jet grouting, was performed to reduce the compressibility of the silty clay, stiffen the sand deposit and provide a desirable shallow foundation system. [...] This site marked the first time that these geotechnical ground improvement techniques were employed.|$|E

500|$|One {{measure of}} cable {{manufacturing}} and installation quality is how closely the characteristic impedance adheres to the nominal impedance along its length. [...] Impedance {{changes can be}} caused by variations in geometry along the <b>cable</b> <b>length.</b> [...] In turn, these {{can be caused by}} a faulty manufacturing process or by faulty installation (such as not observing limits on bend radii). [...] Unfortunately, there is no easy, non-destructive method of directly measuring impedance along a cable's length. [...] It can, however, be indicated indirectly by measuring reflections, that is, return loss. [...] Return loss by itself does not reveal much, since the cable design will have some intrinsic return loss anyway due to not having a purely resistive characteristic impedance. [...] The technique used is to carefully adjust the cable termination to obtain as close a match as possible and then to measure the variation of return loss with frequency. [...] The minimum return loss so measured is called the structural return loss (SRL). [...] SRL is a measure of a cables' adherence to its nominal impedance {{but it is not a}} direct correspondence, errors further from the generator have less effect on SRL than those close to it. [...] The measurement must also be carried out at all in-band frequencies to be significant. [...] The reason for this is that equally spaced errors introduced by the manufacturing process will cancel and be invisible, or at least much reduced, at certain frequencies due to quarter wave impedance transformer action.|$|E

At 9:45, the two frigates sailed side by side and for twenty minutes French boarding parties attempted to storm San Fiorenzo, but British small arms fire repelled them. A fire breaking out in the orlop deck of Psyché further distracted her crew from the fight.|$|E

These were being drawn up and collected in a place of safety by gangs of peasants.
