25|$|Perceived pitch {{typically}} {{depends on}} the fundamental frequency, though the dependence could be mediated solely {{by the presence of}} harmonics corresponding to that fundamental frequency. The perception of a pitch without the corresponding fundamental frequency in the physical stimulus is called the pitch of the missing fundamental. Neurons lateral to A1 in marmoset monkeys were found to be sensitive specifically to the fundamental frequency of a <b>complex</b> <b>tone,</b> suggesting that pitch constancy may be enabled by such a neural mechanism.|$|E

40|$|The {{cortical}} neural correlates for {{the perception}} of harmonic sounds have remained a puzzle despite intense study over several decades. This study approached the problem {{from the point of}} view of the spectral fusion evoked by such sounds. Experiment 1 tested whether ferrets automatically fuse harmonic <b>complex</b> <b>tones.</b> In baseline sessions, three ferrets were trained to detect a pure tone terminating a sequence of inharmonic <b>complex</b> <b>tones.</b> After the ferrets reached proficiency in the baseline task, a small fraction of the inharmonic <b>complex</b> <b>tones</b> were replaced with harmonic tones. Two out of three ferrets confused the harmonic <b>complex</b> <b>tones</b> with the pure tones and responded as if detecting the pure tone at twice the false-alarm rate, indicating that ferrets can automatically fuse the partials of a harmonic complex. Experiment 2 sought correlates of harmonic fusion in single units of ferret primary auditory cortex (AI), by contrasting responses to harmonic <b>complex</b> <b>tones</b> with those to inharmonic <b>complex</b> <b>tones.</b> The effects of spectrotemporal filtering were accounted for by using the measured spectrotemporal receptive field to predict responses and by seeking correlates of harmonic fusion in the predictability of the responses. Ten percent of units exhibited some correlates of harmonic fusion, which is consistent with previous findings that no special processing for harmonic stimuli occurs in AI...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} the dependence of perceived roughness on the frequency ratio of two simultaneous harmonic <b>complex</b> <b>tones.</b> A set of 36 dyads forming mu-sical intervals of various tuning systems was presented in three pitch registers.

Results show that roughness considerably varies with the frequency ratio of the two <b>complex</b> <b>tones,</b> what is a well-known phenomenon. A new finding, being in contrast to published theories of roughness, is that some of the equally-tempered intervals are perceived less rough than their counterparts based on integer frequency ratios. This effect is attributed to slow beats that arise between the harmonics of two <b>complex</b> <b>tones</b> when the frequency ratio of the tones slightly departs from the integer ratio...|$|R

40|$|We {{compared}} magnetoencephalographic {{responses for}} natural vowels and for sounds {{consisting of two}} pure tones that represent the two lowest formant frequencies of these vowels. Our aim {{was to determine whether}} spectral changes in successive stimuli are detected differently for speech and nonspeech sounds. The stimuli were presented in four blocks applying an oddball paradigm (20 % deviants, 80 % standards) : (i) /α/ tokens as deviants vs. /i/ tokens as standards; (ii) /e/ vs. /i/; (iii) <b>complex</b> <b>tones</b> representing /α/ formants vs. /i/ formants; and (iv) <b>complex</b> <b>tones</b> representing /e/ formants vs. /i/ formants. Mismatch fields (MMFs) were calculated by subtracting the source waveform produced by standards from that produced by deviants. As expected, MMF amplitudes for the <b>complex</b> <b>tones</b> reflected acoustic deviation: the amplitudes were stronger for the <b>complex</b> <b>tones</b> representing /α/ than /e/ formants, i. e., when the spectral difference between standards and deviants was larger. In contrast, MMF amplitudes for the vowels were similar despite their different spectral composition, whereas the MMF onset time was longer for /e/ than for /α/. Thus the degree of spectral difference between standards and deviants was reflected by the MMF amplitude for the nonspeech sounds and by the MMF latency for the vowels...|$|R

40|$|We {{designed}} a melody perception experiment involving eight harmonic <b>complex</b> <b>tones</b> of missing fundamental frequencies (hidden auditory object) {{to study the}} short-term neuronal plasticity of the auditory cortex.

The harmonics of the <b>complex</b> <b>tones</b> were chosen so that the spectral melody had an inverse contour when compared with the virtual one. Evoked magnetic fields were recorded contralaterally to the ear of stimulation from both hemispheres. After a base line measurement, the subjects were exposed repeatedly to the experimental stimuli for 1 hour a day. All subjects reported a sudden change in the perceived melody, indicating possible reorganization of the cortical processes involved in the virtual pitch formation. After this switch in perception, a second measurement was performed. Cortical sources of the evoked gamma-band activity were significantly stronger and located more medially after a switch in perception. Independent Component Analysi...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to determine the dependence of perceived roughness on the frequency ratio of two simultaneous harmonic <b>complex</b> <b>tones.</b> In the first experiment, the frequency ratios of the tone pairs corresponded to 35 within-octave intervals of various musi-cal tuning systems. In the second experiment 12 intervals were used; six of them ranged from 10 cents below to 10 cents above an equally-tempered fourth and the other six encompassed a similar range centred around the equally-tempered fifth. In both experiments the amount of roughness was assessed by absolute magnitude estimation. Results show that roughness considerably varies with the frequency ratio {{of a pair of}} harmonic <b>complex</b> <b>tones,</b> which is a well-known phenomenon. A new finding, that is in contrast to published theories of roughness, is that equally-tempered intervals produce less roughness than their counterparts based on in-teger frequency ratios. This effect is attributed to slow beats that arise between the harmon-ics of two <b>complex</b> <b>tones</b> when the frequency ratio of an equally-tempered interval slightly departs from integer ratio. Such beats, heard as fluctuations, impart a smooth character to the sound...|$|R
40|$|Pitch {{differences}} between concurrent sounds are important cues used in auditory scene analysis and {{also play a}} major role in music perception. To investigate the neural codes underlying these perceptual abilities, we recorded from single fibers in the cat auditory nerve in response to two concurrent harmonic <b>complex</b> <b>tones</b> with missing fundamentals and equal-amplitude harmonics. We investigated the efficacy of rate-place and interspike-interval codes to represent both pitches of the two tones, which had fundamental frequency (F 0) ratios of 15 / 14 or 11 / 9. We relied on the principle of scaling invariance in cochlear mechanics to infer the spatiotemporal response patterns to a given stimulus from a series of measurements made in a single fiber as a function of F 0. Templates created by a peripheral auditory model were used to estimate the F 0 s of double <b>complex</b> <b>tones</b> from the inferred distribution of firing rate along the tonotopic axis. This rate-place representation was accurate for F 0 s ≳ 900 Hz. Surprisingly, rate-based F 0 estimates were accurate even when the two-tone mixture contained no resolved harmonics, so long as some harmonics were resolved prior to mixing. We also extended methods used previously for single <b>complex</b> <b>tones</b> to estimate the F 0 s of concurrent <b>complex</b> <b>tones</b> from interspike-interval distributions pooled over the tonotopic axis. The interval-based representation was accurate for F 0 s ≲ 900 Hz, where the two-tone mixture contained no resolved harmonics. Together, the rate-place and interval-based representations allow accurate pitch perception for concurrent sounds over the entire range of human voice and cat vocalizations...|$|R

50|$|Researchers have {{demonstrated}} that by creating banks of tones whose note names are clearly defined perceptually but whose perceived heights are ambiguous, one can create scales that appear to ascend or descend endlessly in pitch. Roger Shepard achieved this ambiguity of height by creating banks of complex tones, with each tone composed only of components that stood in octave relationship. In other words, {{the components of the}} <b>complex</b> <b>tone</b> C consisted only of Cs, but in different octaves, and the components of the <b>complex</b> <b>tone</b> F consisted only of Fs, but in different octaves. When such complex tones are played in semitone steps the listener perceives a scale that appears to ascend endlessly in pitch. Jean-Claude Risset achieved the same effect using gliding tones instead, so that a single tone appeared to glide up or down endlessly in pitch.Circularity effects based on this principle have been produced in orchestral music and electronic music, by having multiple instruments playing simultaneously in different octaves.|$|E
