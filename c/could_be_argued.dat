5|$|Another flaw {{with both}} Wilberforce's and Millett's {{explanations}} {{is that if}} the interest is retained by the lender from the outset of the contract, it is not a resulting trust at all; the complete transfer of money should end the lender's equitable interest. It <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that the creation of a Quistclose trust is not based on the recovery of the original interest, but {{the creation of a new}} one. Doubts have also been raised about the Twinsectra case in general, in that the facts of the case did not create a stereotypical Quistclose trust; this causes problems with applying Millett's analysis.|$|E
5|$|One {{commonly}} held misconception connected to Dyer {{is that he}} holds the second longest unbeaten record of fights of any boxer in world history, after fellow Welsh fighter Jimmy Wilde. This information was published in Nat Fleischer's The Ring: Record Book And Boxing Encyclopedia, in which it states Dyer fought 94 unbeaten fights between 1908 and 1912. Although it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that Dyer may have boxed 94 fights between these years, and may have turned professional in 1908, it is widely accepted that his fight with Dick Emden in 1911 in which he dislocated his knee was a loss. This therefore challenges Fleischer's claim.|$|E
5|$|Victor Watson and Ranny Barton began holding {{tournaments in}} the UK and US, respectively. World Champions were {{declared}} in the United States in 1973 and 1974 (and are still considered official World Champions by Hasbro). While the 1973 tournament, the first, matched three United States regional champions against the UK champion and thus <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> {{as the first}} international tournament, true multinational international tournaments were first held in 1975. Both authors (Orbanes and Brandreth) agree that John Mair was the first true World Champion, as decided in tournament play held in Washington, D.C. days after {{the conclusion of the}} European Championship (which Mair had also won), in November 1975.|$|E

25|$|After this {{decision}} it <b>could</b> plausibly <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> {{that the overall}} ban on translations announced in the encyclicals of 1836 and 1839 {{was no longer in}} force.|$|R
50|$|Yet it <b>could</b> also <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that, {{given that}} this is correct, we as human beings, by our very nature, are {{incapable}} of understanding why it is true.|$|R
5|$|A {{study by}} Sanchez and Wiley showed that seductive details caused poor {{learning}} outcomes because they take {{up some of}} the limited space in working memory. The experiment compared people's ability to control their attention to scientific text that contained either seductive images, relevant images, or no images. The study showed that people with low working memory capacity were especially vulnerable to the seductive details effect. Sanchez and Wiley also did an experiment where eye-tracking was monitored to evaluate how people were reading the same seductively illustrated scientific text. The results showed that people with low working memory looked at the seductive illustrations more often and for longer than those with high working memory capacity. It <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that differences in performance between high- and low- working memory capacity individuals is really due to general reading ability, an attribute that has been correlated with working memory capacity in other studies.|$|E
25|$|It <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued,</b> however, {{that any}} concept which {{attempts}} to assess degree or extent is inherently quantitative.|$|E
25|$|According to Hynek, points 1 through 6 <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued,</b> but point 7 {{represented}} an insurmountable {{barrier to the}} validity of the ETH.|$|E
5000|$|It <b>could</b> also <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> {{that the}} {{horseshoe}} curves immediately South of Bergün at [...] also form a spiral {{as it appears}} that one curve overlaps the other.|$|R
50|$|Watchmen: The {{character}} of Silk Spectre II, Laurie Juspeczyk, is partially based on Nightshade, though it <b>could</b> also <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that the {{character of}} Silhouette had more of her visual style.|$|R
5000|$|While, {{as in the}} {{previous}} verse, the wording seems to imply that God is the final judge, Fowler mentions other possibilities. This <b>could</b> <b>be</b> a teaching on healthy interpersonal relations, and the verse <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>arguing</b> that any who judges their fellows will themselves be judged by those around them. If you find fault with others, others will find fault with you. It could also refer to the danger of excessive internal criticism and self-consciousness. If you are constantly judging others, you will feel others are doing the same and will force yourself to try and meet their standards, in direct contrast to the condemnation of worry in {{the previous}} chapter.|$|R
25|$|It <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> (as, for example, Justice Breyer has) that constitutions {{are meant}} to endure over time, {{and in order to}} do so, their {{interpretation}} must therefore be more flexible and responsive to changing circumstances than the amendment process.|$|E
25|$|With {{the arrival}} of Mike Gascoyne as {{technical}} director, alongside the announcements of Jarno Trulli and Ralf Schumacher for 2005, it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that the Toyota F1 operation took on a slightly different feel {{over the course of}} the 2004 season.|$|E
25|$|Afterwards another truce was {{concluded}} between Holland and the Frisians, which was extended {{again and again}} without many difficulties. No acts of war were undertaken anymore, although it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that a warlike state continued to exist for over a century, until, in 1524, Holland and Friesland both came under Habsburg rule.|$|E
5000|$|The {{book was}} adapted into an Emmy award winning miniseries also called The Corner. Simon {{served as the}} show's writer and {{executive}} producer. It <b>could</b> also <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that this book serves as an inspiration for the TV series [...] "The Wire".|$|R
50|$|The cave {{system is}} {{disposed}} {{more or less}} in a level plane and consists of four interconnected caverns. Two of these caverns are further subdivided by 'walls' composed of dripstone, and it <b>could</b> thus <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that Karaca comprises not four but six chambers.|$|R
50|$|Overpopulation, {{immigration}} and imperialism (of both the militaristic and cultural kind) are reasons {{that have been}} suggested to explain any such decline. However, it <b>could</b> also <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that {{with the advent of}} globalism, a decline in cultural diversity is inevitable because information sharing often promotes homogeneity.|$|R
25|$|Jerry Grossman {{has written}} that it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that Baseball Hall of Famer Hank Aaron can be {{considered}} to have an Erdős number of 1 because they both autographed the same baseball (for Carl Pomerance) when Emory University awarded them honorary degrees on the same day. Erdős numbers have also been proposed for an infant, a horse, and several actors.|$|E
25|$|During his tenure, Sánchez Vilella {{tried to}} change his party's membership, urging a younger {{generation}} to rise in the friends party's organization. It <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that Sánchez Vilella {{was influenced by the}} youth movement that the island was experiencing countrywide during the 1960s, a period where many social areas in Puerto Rico, including television, music and sports, were being introduced to fresh, younger personalities.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 2nd century, Victor, {{bishop of}} Rome, {{attempted}} to resolve the Quartodeciman controversy by excommunicating churches in the Roman province of Asia. This incident is cited by some Orthodox Christians as the first example of overreaching by the Bishop of Rome and resistance of such by Eastern churches. Laurent Cleenewerck suggests that this <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> to be the first fissure between the Eastern and Western churches.|$|E
5000|$|Each of the 51 entries has a caption {{of one or}} {{two lines}} {{indicating}} the moral, followed by an engraving and an epigram (rhyming in couplets). This set of elements is followed by a prose explanation of varying length (up to 12 pages). That there are prose explanations in the first place (and that some of them <b>are</b> so lengthy) <b>could</b> <b>be,</b> <b>argues</b> Els Stronks, because Brune had doubts about the use of images; he considered images to be ambiguous where text was stable and [...] "has a greater potential than the visual arts". Stronks <b>argues</b> that this <b>was</b> characteristic of the attitudes of the Dutch Reformed Church of the time.|$|R
40|$|The {{settlement}} of tools and devices of participatory democracy {{at the regional}} level in Europe, for few years, has been the occasion {{to wonder about the}} “scale” issue in the modern democracy. Indeed, in the specific case of French regions, the problem of a too larger scale, which <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argue</b> against the idea of a regional active citizenship, is overcome thanks to two key resources: methodological “market” of participatory democracy and regional politics. Based on this empirical example, the whole “scalar” argument is now seen as a political argument (that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> contested or ignored) and not a self-evident truth. This definition leads to a proposition for a more clear debate about local democracy, which make the difference between political and technical issues...|$|R

25|$|In the 1930s, the Manchester Grammar School {{moved to}} new {{premises}} in Fallowfield, from its original position {{near the site of}} the present Manchester Cathedral. Although seen to be in Fallowfield, its location <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> to be within the boundaries of the Withington locality. The school has been attended by actors such as Ben Kingsley and Robert Powell, cricketer Mike Atherton, and writer and broadcaster Martin Sixsmith.|$|E
25|$|A seventh step {{could in}} {{principle}} be added, namely a big crisis in society which sparks off a revolution and overturns the existing capitalist system. In that case, it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued,</b> the false masks are torn off, {{and people have}} to stand up for what they really are, and what they really believe in. But that is a possibility which Marx did not comprehensively theorize in Das Kapital.|$|E
25|$|Lankester {{therefore}} had a {{far better}} education than most English biologists of the previous generation, such as Huxley, Wallace and Bates. Even so, it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that the influence of his father Edwin {{and his friends were}} just as important. Huxley was a close friend of the family, and whilst still a child Ray met Hooker, Henfrey, Clifford, Gosse, Owen, Forbes, Carpenter, Lyell, Murchison, Henslow and Darwin.|$|E
50|$|But, in this case, the Court {{held that}} Sony {{did not have}} actual {{knowledge}} of the infringing activities of its customers. At the most it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argues</b> that Sony had constructive knowledge {{of the fact that}} “its customers may use that equipment to make unauthorised copies of copyrighted material.” The court then relied on the “staple article of commerce” doctrine of patent law and applied it to copyrights. The 'staple article of commerce' defence is available under Patent law in the United States and it lays down that when an infringing article is capable of 'substantial non infringing uses', it would become a 'staple article of commerce' and therefore, not attract any liability for infringement.|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to the first objection, the court declared that since the Fifteenth Amendment had been accepted as valid for more than fifty years, and dealt with a similar matter (in this case, that voting rights <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> denied on account of race), it <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that the new amendment was invalid due to its subject matter.|$|R
50|$|Schottky's {{contributions}} in surface science/emission electronics and in semiconductor-device theory now form {{a significant and}} pervasive part of the background to these subjects. It <b>could</b> possibly <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that - perhaps {{because they are in}} the area of technical physics - they are not as generally well recognized as they ought to be.|$|R
25|$|Space {{manufacturing}} {{could enable}} self-replication. Some think it {{the ultimate goal}} because it allows an exponential increase in colonies, while eliminating costs to and dependence on Earth. It <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that the establishment of such a colony would be Earth's first act of self-replication. Intermediate goals include colonies that expect only information from Earth (science, engineering, entertainment) and colonies that just require periodic supply of light weight objects, such as integrated circuits, medicines, genetic material and tools.|$|E
25|$|But {{discrimination}} {{was perhaps}} less overt than such events suggest. It <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that some politicians and publicists may have promoted and disseminated controversial ideologies through popular {{books such as}} H. Glynn-Ward’s 1921 The Writing on the Wall and Tom MacInnes’s 1929 The Oriental Occupation of British Columbia. Newspapermen such as L. D. Taylor of the Vancouver World and General Victor Odlum of the Star generated a glut of editorials analyzing and warning about the “Oriental Menace,” as did Danger: The Anti-Asiatic Weekly.|$|E
25|$|West Frisian: Frysk-Hollânske oarloggen), were {{a series}} of short medieval wars (ranging from single battles to entire campaigns) {{consisting}} of the attempts made by the counts of Holland to conquer the free Frisian territories, which lay {{to the north and}} east of their domain. These wars were waged off and on from 1256 to 1289, 1296 to 1299, and from 1345 to 1422, although it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that a state of war continued to exist between the County of Holland and the Frisian territories till well after the year 1500.|$|E
50|$|Rӧmerstadt {{failed to}} achieve its socialist, utopian goals mainly due to the {{hyperinflation}} of the 1920s, {{which led to a}} prohibitive power prices. It <b>could</b> also <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> that it failed to truly consider the working class. Despite this, as a concept and achievement it was unique and has left a planning legacy worth remembering.|$|R
