25|$|During slow {{freezing}}, {{cells are}} placed in a medium which is cooled below the freezing point using liquid nitrogen. This causes an ice mass to form in the medium. As {{the water in the}} medium freezes, the concentration of the sugars, salts, and <b>cryoprotectant</b> increase. Due to osmosis, the water from the cells enters the medium to keep the concentrations of sugars, salts, and <b>cryoprotectant</b> equal. The water that leaves the cells is eventually frozen, causing more water to diffuse out of the cell. Eventually, the unfrozen portion—cellular—becomes too viscous for ice crystals to form inside of the cell.|$|E

The effect of coating of CS-NPs with hyaluronic acid (HA) and alginic acid (ALG) before and after lyophilization was also evaluated. The ionic gelation method was used for the preparation of NPs and six different types of <b>cryoprotectants</b> (sucrose, glucose, trehalose, mannitol, polyethylene glycol- 2000, and polyethylene glycol- 10, 000) were investigated at 5 %, 10 %, 20 %, and 50 % concentration levels. Coating of CS-NPs with HA and their protection with high amount of <b>cryoprotectants</b> indicated better particle size stability. Samples that were lyophilized without <b>cryoprotectants</b> resulted in an increase in average size due to high agglomeration. All <b>cryoprotectants</b> with varying amount provided some sort of size stability for the NPs except for the PEG- 10, 000 which had no protective effect at higher concentrations.

25|$|In the laboratory, {{glycerol}} is {{a common}} component of solvents for enzymatic reagents stored at temperatures below 0°C due to the depression of the freezing temperature of solutions with high concentrations of glycerol.

25|$|Slow cooling methods rely on {{the fact}} that cells contain few {{nucleating}} agents, but contain naturally occurring vitrifying substances that can prevent ice formation in cells that have been moderately dehydrated. Some cryobiologists are seeking mixtures of cryoprotectants for full vitrification (zero ice formation) in preservation of cells, tissues, and organs. Vitrification methods pose a challenge in the requirement to search for <b>cryoprotectant</b> mixtures that can minimize toxicity.|$|E

25|$|For {{red blood}} cells, the optimum cooling rate is very rapid (nearly 100°C per second), whereas for stem cells the optimum cooling rate is very slow (1°C per minute). Cryoprotectants, such as {{dimethyl}} sulfoxide and glycerol, {{are used to}} protect cells from freezing. A variety of cell types are protected by 10% dimethyl sulfoxide. Cryobiologists attempt to optimize <b>cryoprotectant</b> concentration (minimizing both ice formation and toxicity) and cooling rate. Cells may be cooled at an optimum rate to a temperature between 30 and 40°C before being plunged into liquid nitrogen.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} idea {{to explain}} the greater prevalence of diabetes in more northerly populations was suggested by Moalem et al. who noted that recent animal research has uncovered {{the importance of the}} generation of elevated levels of glucose, glycerol and other sugar derivatives as a physiological means for cold adaptation. High concentrations of these substances depress the freezing point of body fluids and prevent the formation of ice crystals in cells through supercooling, thus acting as a <b>cryoprotectant</b> or antifreeze for vital organs as well as in their muscle tissue. They consequently suggested that factors predisposing to elevated levels of glucose, glycerol and other sugar derivatives may have been selected for, in part, as adaptive measures in exceedingly cold climates. The authors suggest that this cryoprotective adaptation would have protected ancestral northern Europeans from the effects of suddenly increasingly colder climates, such as those believed to have arisen around 14,000 years ago and culminating in the Younger Dryas. A major issue with this whole idea, however, is that glucose, gycerol and sugar derivatives only become useful as cryoprotectants as the body temperature falls to the point where tissues are at risk of freezing – which is below 0 oC. Since no human ever survived a period of hypothermia with a body temperature less than 10 oC, because of heart failure, there is no possibility that this could ever have provided any selective advantage in our past history – no matter how cold the external temperature was.|$|E
500|$|P.exclamans {{lives in}} a {{hierarchical}} society with one queen that lays the eggs. However, all of the females have the same morphology {{and they all have}} the physiological capability of taking over the egg laying if necessary (queen death, queen migration). Since the queen has the same morphology {{as the rest of the}} workers in the colony, this raises the question as to how the queen role is assigned and what makes her special. Studies have found that queens and males have higher levels of glucose, fructose and trehalose than workers, leading to higher <b>cryoprotectant</b> levels. P.exclamans use these sugars as <b>cryoprotectant,</b> which work by increasing the solute concentration in cells. This results in a greater survivability in colder weather. It was found that queens have a 76% survival rate in [...] weather compared to 17% survival of the workers over a 15-day test period. The queens also have a 0.5mm layer of fat surrounding their bodies. This allows them to live longer into the winter and possibly extend their mating season. The queens seem to be the only ones capable of diapause.|$|E

500|$|The crystal {{is mounted}} for {{measurements}} {{so that it}} may be held in the X-ray beam and rotated. There are several methods of mounting. In the past, crystals were loaded into glass capillaries with the crystallization solution (the mother liquor). [...] Nowadays, crystals of small molecules are typically attached with oil or glue to a glass fiber or a loop, which is made of nylon or plastic and attached to a solid rod. [...] Protein crystals are scooped up by a loop, then flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen. This freezing reduces the radiation damage of the X-rays, as well as the noise in the Bragg peaks due to thermal motion (the Debye-Waller effect). However, untreated protein crystals often crack if flash-frozen; therefore, they are generally pre-soaked in a <b>cryoprotectant</b> solution before freezing. Unfortunately, this pre-soak may itself cause the crystal to crack, ruining it for crystallography. Generally, successful cryo-conditions are identified by trial and error.|$|E
