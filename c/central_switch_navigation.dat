5000|$|Scalability {{and speed}} - Connecting all the devices to one <b>central</b> <b>switch,</b> either {{directly}} or through hubs, increases the potential for collisions (due to hubs), reduced speed at which the data can be transmitted and additional time for the <b>central</b> <b>switch</b> to process the data. It also scales badly and increases the chance of the network failing if excessive hubs are used and {{there are not enough}} switches to control the flow of the data through the network.|$|R

40|$|STARNET is a {{fiber optic}} based network which {{facilitates}} the interconnection of distributed Local Area Networks. Configured as a sixteen pointed star topology with a multiprocessor based controller {{at the center}} of the star (named the <b>Central</b> <b>Switch).</b> STARNET is capable of scheduling calls from users connected to User Access Nodes located at the points of the star. Messages are passed from one node to another through the <b>Central</b> <b>Switch</b> via duplex fiber optic lines connecting each node to the center. This paper presents a multiprocessor based design of the User Access Node. The hardware and software structure is examined in depth, providing solid guidelines for the physical construction of the unit. The performances of statistical STARNET models using parameters obtained from the design (and three different <b>Central</b> <b>Switch</b> models) are plotted and compared for five different examples of external traffic. The model analysis gives an indication of the expected message delays, supporting the feasibility of the design...|$|R

50|$|Electromechanical <b>central</b> <b>switch</b> {{has to be}} {{carefully}} selected as it has inherent operating times both opening and closing. It {{has to have a}} stored-energy mechanism and a DC operated release solenoid for a controllable “open” command signal. Detection of the motor current zero crossing may be obtained from a current transformer/resistor voltage sensing circuit, not a voltage crossing. The use of electromechanical contactors is not recommended for a <b>central</b> <b>switch</b> as their switch opening speed consistency is subjected to the voltage applied to the hold-in coil. During a motor start the line voltage drop will fluctuate and the magnetic flux in the hold-in device will also vary, causing deviations in opening times.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Most {{of current}} {{asynchronous}} on-chip routers use the virtual channel flow control method which com-promises throughput and latency. Instead of using virtual channels, an asynchronous spatial division multiplexing (SDM) router {{has been proposed}} recently. The major design overhead of an SDM router is the enlarged <b>central</b> <b>switch</b> which increases proportionally {{to the number of}} virtual circuits. Clos switches provide theoretically the optimal structure for high-radix switches. A novel 2 -stage Clos switch is proposed and integrated into an SDM router. It is shown that the 2 -stage Clos switch significantly reduce the area consumption of the <b>central</b> <b>switch</b> and the switch allocator. It is also found that SDM and the 2 -stage Clos switch reduce power consumption. I...|$|R

ISSWN combines a standard powered wheelchair with a laser rangefinder, a single switch scanning interface and a computer. It provides the user with context sensitive and task specific scanning options that reduce driving effort based on an interpretation of sensor data together with user input.

50|$|The {{report found}} that the ship's fathometer, which {{measures}} water depth, was broken, as well as both radar repeaters on the cruiser's bridge. Some time before the grounding, the ship <b>switched</b> <b>navigation</b> systems from a Global Positioning System, called the Voyage Management System, to a gyroscope. The switch caused a 1.5 mi discrepancy in the ship's reported position. Audible alarm bells triggered by the discrepancy were disregarded by the ship's crew. During the small-boat transfer, the cruiser's operations officer took a binocular bearing to the harbor landing from the boat deck and noted the position discrepancy, {{but was unable to}} correct the ship's course in time. Shortly thereafter, the ship ran soft aground, but then quickly was forced hard aground by the force of the waves.|$|R
