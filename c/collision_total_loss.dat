40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} secure the policyholders against losses due to {{earthquakes}} that are common natural calamities in Taiwan, the government launched a residential earthquake insurance system several years ago. Policyholders can be indemnified by <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> claim for quake-related losses of property. Despite {{there are many other}} professionals involved in the assessment procedure for <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> claim, the qualified adjustors from underwriters are pivotal to the assessment of <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> claims. The qualified adjustors are personnel of non-life insurance companies that underwent training courses for earthquake building damage assessment {{and many of them are}} not professionals in civil engineering. Their determination of <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> claims are based on claim standard operation procedure (SOP) established by Taiwan Residential Earthquake Insurance Fund (TREIF) and mainly relies on personal experience and knowledge of earthquake building damages. Furthermore, considering that reinforced concrete buildings account for more than 76 % effective policies in Taiwan, a quantified <b>loss</b> model for <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> claim determination for RC buildings has been developed in 2009. In this paper, we developed an information system based on the quantified loss model and claims SOP that includes a <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> claim determination system (TLCDS) for qualified adjustors of insurance companies and a centralized database management system (TLDBMS) for TREIF.

40|$|To {{what extent}} should insureds expect {{compensation}} on interruption to their voyage by loss of possession or free use or disposal {{of their property}} where it remains undamaged? Marine insurance does not compensate for partial losses occasioned by delay. Recent authority (Masefield v Amlin Corporate Member) confirmed an insured could not recover for an actual <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> following capture where pirates would accept ransom then release the property. Property was not an actual <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> even after condemnation by a foreign tribunal (Panamanian Oriental Steamship Corporation v Wright), although condemnation might establish constructive <b>total</b> <b>loss.</b> Where the voyage becomes impossible by detention or embargo, the insured’s right to abandon to insurers for constructive <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> may be unpredictable (eg after one year’s duration in The Bamburi). In each scenario, insurers are excused making prompt payments, and from dealing themselves {{with the consequences of}} the peril. In each the insured is either uncompensated, or at best must wait. These authorities document an evolution; historically, English and American laws allowed the insured to abandon and recover for a <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> while these perils lasted, ignoring ongoing hopes of recovery. This thesis argues that a presumption of <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> still applies to all perils causing loss of possession. This appeared first in Continental treatises and was later applied in English law. No universal test of <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> applies equally to all marine perils. Instead, situations of loss of possession should be governed by peril-specific rules, including the presumption of <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> for perils causing loss of possession...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{aimed at}} {{determining}} the <b>total</b> <b>losses</b> {{associated with the}} season, transportation distance, and slaughter age during the transportation of broilers from poultry farms to slaughterhouses in Turkey. All data and parameters were statistically analyzed and the change in <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> during transportation was evaluated by two-way analysis of variance to determine which factors or variables affect this change. <b>Total</b> transportation <b>losses</b> were compared among the four seasons of the year, two slaughter ages (younger broiler, 31 - 39 days of age; older broilers 40 - 46 days of age) and three distance ranges (short, ≤ 50 km; medium, 51 - 150 km; and long, ≥ 151 km). <b>Total</b> <b>losses</b> of 259. 40 g, 307. 35 g, and 350. 14 g were determined for short, medium and long distances, respectively, indicating that losses increased with transportation distance (p< 0. 05). Broilers slaughtered {{at a younger age}} presented lower <b>total</b> <b>losses</b> than those slaughtered at an older age (p< 0. 05). When seasons were evaluated, the highest <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> was determined in the summer, which was not statistically different from that calculated for autumn, whereas <b>total</b> transportation <b>losses</b> in spring and winter were found relatively lower.

40|$|Embodying a thin {{metallic}} layer {{underneath the}} core of a sharply bent polymer waveguide is shown in this work to considerably reduce the <b>total</b> <b>losses</b> of both the quasi-transverse-electric and quasi-transversemagnetic modes.

The radii range exhibiting such low <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> can be tuned by properly selecting the parameters of the structure.

40|$|A <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> of all {{heat sinks}} is {{considered}} a severe accident with a low probability of occurrence. Following a <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> of all heat sinks, the degasser/condenser relief valves (DCRV) become the sole means available for the depressurization of the primary heat transport system. If {{a nuclear power plant}} has a <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> of heat sinks accident, high-temperature steam and differential pressure between the primary heat transport system (PHTS) and the steam generator (SG) secondary side can cause a SG tube creep rupture. To protect the PHTS during a <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> of all heat sinks accident, a sufficient depressurization capability of the degasser/condenser relief valve and the SG tube integrity is very important. Therefore, an accurate estimation of the discharge through these valves is necessary {{to assess the impact of}} the PHTS overprotection and the SG tube integrity of the primary circuit. This paper describes the analysis of DCRV discharge capacity and the SG tube integrity under a <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> of all heat sink using the CATHENA code. It was found that the DCRV's discharge capacity is enough to protect the overpressure in the PHTS, and the SG tube integrity is maintained in a <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> of all heat accident...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A typical {{problem of}} radial {{magnetic}} bearing is chosen and bearing involving n-pole pairs, where n = 2, 4, 6, 8, are designed. The <b>total</b> <b>losses</b> {{in each case}} are computed for different rotor speeds. A comparative study of the <b>total</b> <b>losses</b> in each case is performed theoretically in order to arrive at possible optimum situations. The major dimensions required {{for the analysis of}} losses were obtained in all those cases. A loss analysis was performed and the results were presented. It was found that there was a drastic decrease in the <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> from two pole pair to four pole pair. On the whole, it appeared as though four pole pair gives the minimum <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> for all the speeds. Further a better analysis of <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> in four pole pair radial magnetic bearing was performed using genetic algorithms in two sections. Initially objective functions have been considered, namely minimization <b>total</b> power <b>loss</b> considering three variables like air gap length, rotor speed, and lamination thickness of rotor.
