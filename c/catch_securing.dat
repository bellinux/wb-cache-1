First actual fishery situation become sharply cleared by concerning about characteristic of the area for fishing from 'the rate of fishing' is the ratio which catches occupied per quantity of quota. Second, it is cleared that there is group which has been continuously making the Over-Fishing and the number of these groups are increasing year after year. The cause of continuous the Over-Fishing is fisherman tend to catch not only quantity of quota but also catches that they can pay a penalty.

5000|$|The sail {{was held}} in place by the mast which was up to 16 m tall. Its base was about 250 x 180 mm. The mast was {{supported}} by a large wooden maststep called a kerling ("Old Woman" [...] in Old Norse) that was semicircular in shape. (Trent) The kerling was made of oak, and about 700 mm wide and up to 6 m long in the larger ships. It usually heavily tapered into a joint with the internal keelson, although keelsons were by no means universal. The kerling lay across two strong frames that ran width-wise above the keel in the centre of the boat. The kerling also had a companion: the [...] "mast fish," [...] a wooden timber above the kerling just below deck height that provided extra help in keeping the mast erect. It was a large wooden baulk of timber about 3 m long with a 1.4 m slot, facing aft to accommodate the mast as it was raised. This acted as a mechanism to <b>catch</b> and <b>secure</b> the mast before the stays were secured. It was an early form of mast partner but was aligned fore and aft. In later longships there is no mast fish-the mast partner is an athwartwise beam similar to more modern construction. Most masts were about half the length of the ship so that it did not project beyond the hull when unstepped. When lowered the mast foot was kept in the base of the mast step and the top of the mast secured in a natural wooden crook about 1.5 - 2.5 m high, on the port side, so that it did not interfere with steering on the starboard side.|$|R
25|$|The Glock's frame, {{magazine}} body, {{and several}} other components are made from a high-strength nylon-based polymer invented by Gaston Glock, called Polymer 2. This plastic was specially formulated to provide increased durability and is more resilient than carbon steel and most steel alloys. Polymer 2 is resistant to shock, caustic liquids, and temperature extremes where traditional steel/alloy frames would warp and become brittle. The injection-molded frame contains four hardened steel guide rails for the slide: two {{at the rear of}} the frame, and the remaining pair above and in front of the trigger guard. The trigger guard itself is squared off at the front and checkered. The grip has an angle of 109° and a nonslip, stippled surface on the sides and both the front and rear straps. The frame houses the locking block, which is an investment casting that engages a 45° camming surface on the barrel's lower camming lug. It is retained in the frame by a steel axis pin that holds the trigger and slide catch. The trigger housing is held to the frame by means of a polymer pin. A spring-loaded sheet-metal pressing serves as the slide <b>catch,</b> which is <b>secured</b> from unintentional manipulation by a raised guard molded into the frame.|$|R

40|$|This study, part of {{a broader}} {{investigation}} of the history of exploitation of right whales, Balaena glacialis, in the western North Atlantic, emphasizes U. S. shore whaling from Maine to Delaware (from lat. 45 °N to 38 ° 30 'N) in the period 1620 – 1924. Our broader study of the entire catch history is intended to provide an empirical basis for assessing past distribution and abundance of this whale population. Shore whaling may have begun at Cape Cod, Mass., in the 1620 ’s or 1630 ’s; it was certainly underway there by 1668. Right whale catches in New England waters peaked before 1725, and shore whaling at Cape Cod, Martha’s Vineyard, and Nantucket continued to decline {{through the rest of the}} 18 th century. Right whales continued to be taken opportunistically in Massachusetts, however, until the early 20 th century. They were hunted in Narragansett Bay, R. I., as early as 1662, and desultory whaling continued in Rhode Island until at least 1828. Shore whaling in Connecticut may have begun in the middle 1600 ’s, continuing there until at least 1718. Long Island shore whaling spanned the period 1650 – 1924. From its Dutch origins in the 1630 ’s, a persistent shore whaling enterprise developed in Delaware Bay and along the New Jersey shore. Although this activity was most profi table in New Jersey in the early 1700 ’s, it continued there until at least the 1820 ’s. Whaling in all areas of the northeastern United States was seasonal, with most catches in the winter and spring. Historically, right whales appear to have been essentially absent from coastal waters south of Maine during the summer and autumn. Based on documented references to specific whale kills, about 750 – 950 right whales were taken between Maine and Delaware, from 1620 to 1924. Using production statistics in British customs records, the estimated total <b>secured</b> <b>catch</b> of right whales in New England, New York, and Pennsylvania between 1696 and 1734 was 3, 839 whales based on oil and 2, 049 based on baleen. After adjusting these totals for hunting loss (loss-rate correction factor = 1. 2), we estimate that 4, 607 (oil) or 2, 459 (baleen) right whales were removed from the stock in this region during the 38 -year period 1696 – 1734. A cumulative catch estimate of the stock’s size in 1724 is 1, 100 – 1, 200. Although recent evidence of occurrence and movements suggests that right whales continue to use their traditional migratory corridor along the U. S. east coast, the catch history indicates that this stock was much larger in the 1600 ’s and early 1700 ’s than it is today. Right whale hunting in the eastern United States ended by the early 1900 ’s, and the species has been protected throughout the North Atlantic since the mid 1930 ’s. Among the possible reasons for the relatively slow stock recovery are: the very small number of whales that survived the whaling era to become founders, a decline in environmental carrying capacity, and, especially in recent decades, mortality from ship strikes and entanglement in fishing gear...|$|R
