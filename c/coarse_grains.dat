25|$|The Magadha economy, under Mauryan royal government, {{depended}} {{mainly on}} agriculture {{and the state}} owned large farm lands for cultivation. The other income of the state came from the taxes levied on agriculture, land, trade, and industrial products such as handicrafts. Mauryan agriculture had two type of landholdings, one were the Rashtra type of holdings which were the direct descendants of the holdings of the former tribal oligarchies who had been subjugated in pre-Mauryan times. The Rashtra landholdings were independent of the state machinery in their internal functioning and administration. Their only obligation was the regular payment of the Rashtra taxes to the state. The second major type of landholdings were the Sita landholdings. These were formed by clearing forest lands {{with the help of}} the tribesmen whose tribal way of life had been systematically and annihilated by the Mauryan statecraft. Rice, Wheat, <b>Coarse</b> <b>grains,</b> Sesame, Pepper, Saffron, Pulses, Linseed, mustard, vegetables and fruits of various kinds and sugarcane were grown. The state owned huge farms and these were cultivated by slaves and farm labourers. Water Reservoir and dam were built during this period and they were measured and distributed. The chief industries were mining, metallurgy, jewellery, pot making, textile. The trade was regulated by the state. Artisans and the craftsmen were specially protected by the state and any offences against them were severely punished. Guilds were powerful institutions during this period and they provided economic, political and judicial powers to craftsmen. The chief of the guild was called Jesthaka. A few guilds issued their own coins. These guilds also made donations to learned brahmans and to the destitute. The Mauryan empire supplied western countries with Indigo and other medicinal substances, cotton, silk. Trade was carried out in both land and sea. Godowns, Warehouses were built and special provisions were made to protect the trade routes. The state controlled the weights and measures.|$|E
