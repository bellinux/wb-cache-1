5000|$|An {{alternative}} technology, branched DNA assay, can be {{used for}} RNA (mRNA, lncRNA, and miRNA [...] ) in situ hybridization assays with single molecule sensitivity without the use of radioactivity. This approach (e.g., ViewRNA assays) {{can be used}} to visualize up to four targets in one assay, and it uses patented probe design and bDNA signal amplification to generate sensitive and specific signals. Samples (cells, tissues, and CTCs) are fixed, then treated to allow RNA target accessibility (RNA un-masking). Target-specific probes hybridize to each target RNA. Subsequent signal amplification is predicated on specific hybridization of adjacent probes (individual oligonucleotides oligos that bind side by side on RNA targets). A typical target-specific probe will contain 40 oligonucleotides, resulting in 20 oligo pairs that bind side-by-side on the target for detection of mRNA and lncRNA, and 2 oligos or a single pair for miRNA detection. Signal amplification is achieved via a series of sequential hybridization steps. A pre-amplifier molecule hybridizes to each oligo pair on the target-specific RNA, then multiple amplifier molecules hybridize to each pre-amplifier. Next, multiple label probe oligonucleotides (conjugated to alkaline phosphatase or directly to fluorophores) hybridize to each amplifier molecule. A fully assembled signal amplification structure “Tree” has 400 binding sites for the label probes. When all target-specific probes bind to the target mRNA transcript, an 8,000 fold signal amplification occurs for that one transcript. Separate but <b>compatible</b> <b>signal</b> amplification systems enable the multiplex assays. The signal can be visualized using a fluorescence or brightfield microscope.|$|E

Rolling circle amplification (RCA) is a molecular amplification method with the unique property of product localization. This report describes the application of RCA signal amplification for multiplexed, direct detection and quantitation of nucleic acid targets on planar glass and gel-coated microarrays. As few as 150 molecules bound to the surface of microarrays can be detected using RCA. Because of the linear kinetics of RCA, nucleic acid target molecules may be measured with a dynamic range of four orders of magnitude. Consequently, RCA is a promising technology for the direct measurement of nucleic acids on microarrays without the need for a potentially biasing preamplification step...|$|E
40|$|The growing {{efficiency}} in manufacturing of semiconductor devices combined with increased speed, size {{and performance of}} integrated products puts an incredible pressure on testing and verification technology. While negligible in the past, the cost of verification for a modern semiconductor design can {{be as high as}} half of the total manufacturing cost. In order to accommodate testing requirements, modern test equipment is required to operate up to 100 times faster than the state-of-the-art production circuits while using technologies several generations older. The challenge for a test engineer is to adopt older equipment to new testing needs. The challenge for a researcher is to develop unique methodology to overcome performance limitations and to reduce testing costs. The challenge of this dissertation is to design and manufacture a testing system {{for the next generation of}} testing equipment. This dissertation is based on prior research into the capability of Iddt and Vddt testing methods. The primary goal is to develop an interface for capturing high speed analog transients visible on the chip power supply. This involves acquisition of multiple transient signals in parallel at rates above 1 GHz. This goal is achieved by adopting technologies such as Delta Sigma modulation for size reduction and Equivalent Time Sampling for timing resolution and bandwidth reduction. The secondary goal is to demonstrate the signal processing practicality of the proposed data acquisition system. A <b>compatible</b> <b>signal</b> processor design is required to demonstrate the validity of the proposed data acquisition approach.

40|$|UnrestrictedWe {{are living}} in a world that has {{constant}} demands for increasing communication channel throughput as new applications emerge every day. However, spectrum as a limited resource, cannot be allocated to new applications. On the other hand, existing applications are not utilizing the allocated bands to their maximum throughput. Naturally reusing the spectrum used by existing applications is considered. Since the existing applications cannot be disturbed in most of the cases, the reuse of the spectrum must be backward compatible with existing systems.; In this thesis, a backward <b>compatible</b> <b>signal</b> design technique for throughput improvement has been proposed.

In addition, the design makes full use of the advantages of GPU parallel processing and improves the efficiency of signal acquisition.

40|$|Process {{diagnosis}} {{is essential to}} ensure anaerobic fermentation stable and efficient. Here, a novel sensor system combining microbial fuel cell (MFC), gas flow meter and pH meter was developed to evaluate its feasibility for probing the anaerobic process established on a model high-rate bioreactor. Repeated transient responses of electrical signal, proton concentration, and gas flow rate, were observed subject to external disturbances. The transient response lasted from < 1 h to 6 h. In addition, MFC obtained <b>compatible</b> <b>signal</b> variations with other sensors, and biofilm MFC (MFCBiofilm) resulted in better agreements than control MFC (MFCControl). These results revealed that 1) the composite sensor system was capable to probe anaerobic process, suggesting a novel approach for process analysis and diagnosis of biogas or biohydrogen production; 2) the variations of sensor signals might provide more valuable information for process diagnosis than sensor signals themselves.

The monochrome frame buffer supports 1-bit color and a resolution of 1024 × 864 pixels, while the color frame buffer supports 8-bit color and the same resolution as the monochrome frame buffer. Both frame buffers use the Brooktree Bt478 RAMDAC with three 256-entry, 8-bit color maps. The hardware cursor is generated by DC503 PCC (Programmable Cursor Chip), which can provide a 16 × 16 pixel, 2-bit color cursor. The color frame buffer has an 8-bit write mask, used to select which pixel(s) are to be updated.

40|$|Animal {{communication}} {{relies on}} conspicuous signals and <b>compatible</b> <b>signal</b> perception abilities. Good signal perception abilities {{are particularly important}} for polymorphic animals where mate choice can be a challenge. Behavioral studies suggest that polymorphic damselflies use their varying body colorations and/or color patterns as communication signal for mate choice and to control mating frequencies. However, solid evidence for this hypothesis combining physiological with spectral and behavioral data is scarce. We investigated this question in the Australian common blue tail damselfly, Ischnura heterosticta, which has pronounced female-limited polymorphism: andromorphs have a male-like blue coloration and gynomorphs display green/grey colors. We measured body color reflectance and investigated the visual capacities of each morph, showing that I. heterosticta have at least three types of photoreceptors sensitive to UV, blue, and green wavelength, and that this visual perception ability enables them to detect the spectral properties of the color signals emitted from the various color morphs in both males and females. We further demonstrate that different color morphs can be discriminated against {{each other and the}} vegetation based on color contrast. Finally, these findings were supported by field observations of natural mating pairs showing that mating partners are indeed chosen based on their body coloration.

For these computers clock rate was considered a technical detail of interest only to users needing accurate timing for their own programs.
