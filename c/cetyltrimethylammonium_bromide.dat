40|$|Aqueous {{solutions}} containing amphiphilic polycations and micelle-forming surfactants of {{the same}} charge were examined by potentiometric, fluorescence, sedimentation, and viscometric techniques. Copolymers containing N-ethyl- 4 -vinylpyridinium bromide units and relatively small numbers of either N-dodecyl- 4 -vinylpyridinium bromide or N-cetyl- 4 -vinylpyridinium bromide units were used as amphiphilic polycations. The surfactants were dodecyl- and <b>cetyltrimethylammonium</b> <b>bromides</b> and their pyridinium analogs. The formation of copolymer-surfactant complexes in dilute solution was established, and the complexation behavior was shown to depend upon the copolymer to surfactant concentration ratio in the mixture. At surfactant concentrations lower {{than or equal to}} the critical micelle concentration (cmc) complexation leads to compact structures via formation of intrachain aggregates containing several hydrophobic chain units and surfactant molecules. At the cmc, the maximum number of surfactant ions bound per hydrophobic copolymer chain unit increases with increasing length of the polymer side group and decreases for copolymers that are initially in the compact conformation. At surfactant concentrations greater than the cmc the intrachain aggregates are disrupted and copolymer coil expansion occurs. The resultant copolymer-surfactant complexes consist of surfactant micelles, each bound to one hydrophobic chain unit of the copolymer...|$|R

50|$|The seed-mediated growth {{method is}} the most common and {{achieved}} method for synthesizing high-quality gold nanorods. A typical growth protocol involves the addition of citrate-capped gold nanospheres, served as seeds, to the bulk HAuCl4 growth solution. The growth solution is obtained by the reduction of HAuCl4 with ascorbic acid in the presence of <b>cetyltrimethylammonium</b> <b>bromide</b> (CTAB) surfactant and silver ions. Longer nanorods (up to an aspect ratio of 25) can be obtained in the absence of silver nitrate by use of a three-step addition procedure. In this protocol, seeds are sequentially added to growth solution in order to control the rate of heterogeneous deposition and thereby the rate of crystal growth.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, the {{amphiphilic}} {{nature of}} the Janus nanoparticles was examined by measuring the adhesion force between the atomic force microscopy (AFM) tip and the particle surface. The stronger interactions between the hydrophilic AFM tip and the hydrophilic side of the Janus nanoparticles were reflected by a greater adhesion force. The Janus nanoparticles were dropcast onto both hydrophobically and hydrophilically modified substrates. The hydrophobic hemisphere of the Janus particles was exposed when a hydrophilic substrate surface was used, resulting in disparities in adhesion force measurements. Thus, the Janus nanoparticles adopted a conformation that maximized the interactions with the substrate surface. The nature of amphiphilic Janus nanoparticles to orient themselves spontaneously at the interface between oil and water has been well known. This behavior allows considering amphiphilic Janus nanoparticles as analogues of molecular surfactants for the stabilization of emulsions. In 2005, spherical silica particles with amphiphilic properties were prepared by partial modification of the external surface with an alkylsilane agent. These particles form spherical assemblies encapsulating water-immiscible organic compounds in aqueous media by facing their hydrophobic alkylsilylated side to the inner organic phase and their hydrophilic side to the outer aqueous phase, thus stabilizing oil droplets in water. In 2009, hydrophilic surface of silica particles was made partially hydrophobic by adsorbing <b>cetyltrimethylammonium</b> <b>bromide.</b> These amphiphilic nanoparticles spontaneously assembled at the water-dichloromethane interface. In 2010, Janus particles composed from silica and polystyrene, with the polystyrene portion loaded with nanosized magnetite particles, were used to form kinetically stable oil-in-water emulsions that can be spontaneously broken on application of an external magnetic field. Such Janus materials will find applications in magnetically controlled optical switches and other related areas.The first real applications of Janus nanoparticles were in polymer synthesis. In 2008, spherical amphiphilic Janus nanoparticles, having one polystyrene and one poly(methyl methacrylate) side, were shown to be effective as compatibilizing agents of multigram scale compatibilization of two immiscible polymer blends, polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate). The Janus nanoparticles oriented themselves at the interface of the two polymer phases, even under high temperature and shear conditions, allowing the formation of much smaller domains of poly(methyl methacrylate) in a polystyrene phase. The performance of the Janus nanoparticles as compatibilizing agents was significantly superior to other state-of-the-art compatibilizers, such as linear block copolymers.|$|E
40|$|The {{adsorption}} of <b>cetyltrimethylammonium</b> (CTA) <b>bromide</b> and cetylpyridinium (CP) chloride on Na+-rich montmorillonite (MMT) was studied. An ad hoc isotachophoretic (ITP) {{method was}} developed for the simultaneous and rapid determination of the cationic surfactants (CSs) adsorbed. In order to decrease the detection limits, ITP was on-line coupled with capillary zone electrophoresis. Adsorption data were analysed by their fitting with adsorption isotherms. The adsorption of CP is well described by the Langmuir isotherm. It indicates the monolayer arrangement of CP on the MMT surface. In case of the CTA data, the best fitting Langmuir- Freundlich model with the power constant r< 1 was found.

50|$|The {{one-step}} Stöber {{process may}} {{be modified to}} manufacture porous silica by adding a surfactant template to the reaction mixture and calcining the resulting particles. Surfactants {{that have been used}} include cetrimonium <b>bromide,</b> <b>cetyltrimethylammonium</b> chloride, and glycerol. The surfactant forms micelles, small near-spherical balls with a hydrophobic interior and a hydrophilic surface, around which the silica network grows, producing particles with surfactant- and solvent-filled channels.

30|$|The {{review on}} catanionic systems between 1943 and early 1996 {{was done by}} Khan and Marques 1997 and they noticed {{that most of the}} mixed cationic-anionic {{surfactant}} systems, commonly known as catanionic systems, precipitate at equimolar concentrations at very high water content. At nonequimolar concentration, the mixture forms micelles with different sizes and shapes, closed bilayer vesicles and dilute lamellar phases. The formation of aggregates and their transformation are rationalized in terms of interaction forces and surfactant geometry. These features were also illustrated by Tomasic et al. (1999) on the mixed system of <b>cetyltrimethylammonium</b> <b>bromide</b> - sodium dodecyl sulphate. The precipitation occurred while mixing the equimolar amount of cationic (<b>cetyltrimethylammonium</b> <b>bromide)</b> and anionic (sodium dodecyl sulphate) surfactants. Therefore, while making the solution of surfactants’ mixture, we used excess amount of sodium dodecyl sulphate in comparison to <b>cetyltrimethylammonium</b> <b>bromide</b> because at a very high excess of one of the surfactants, the systems became clear due to mixed micelle formation (Tomasic et al. 1999).|$|E
40|$|Extraction of iron(III) from sulphuric and {{hydrochloric}} acid solutions containing {{an excess of}} thiocyanate ions with tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP) chloride and <b>cetyltrimethylammonium</b> (CTMA) <b>bromide</b> in chloroform was investigated. Optimum conditions for extraction by both extractants were determined. The extraction behaviour of CTMA {{was found to be}} more efficacious than that of TPP because less thiocyanate and extractant was required. Better extraction efficiency of CTMA can be attributed to surface-active properties of this substance. Formation of an extractable iron(III) thiocyanate complex with CTMA or TPP was also determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance of the organic phase at 473 nm or 506 nm, respectively. The composition of the extracted iron(III) complexes was determined by distribution and spectrophotometric methods. The molar ratio Fe:SCN:TPP of the extracted complex was 1 : 4 : 1; accordingly, its composition was [TPP][Fe(SCN) 4]. The molar ratio Fe:CTMA of the extracted complex was 1 : 3. The molar ratio Fe:SCN in the complex extracted with CTMA could not be determined because of the turbidity in solutions containing less than 0. 01 mol dm– 3 thiocyanate ion, but it was concluded that the composition of the extracted complex was [CTMA] 3 [Fe(SCN) 6]...|$|R

The formation of an extractable copper(II) thiocyanate complex with CTMA could also be determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance of the organic phase at 409 nm. The presence of ascorbic acid decreased the absorbance at 409 nm but the formed copper(I) thiocyanate was quantitatively extracted with CTMA, independently of the ascorbic acid concentration. Thiocyanate ions also exercised a reducing effect on copper(II) at pH > 1. 3; with increasing pH and/or prolonged shaking time of the aqueous and organic phases, the reducing effect increased. The composition of the extracted copper(II) complex was determined by the distribution and spectrophotometric methods.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} avenues towards improving the efficiency of organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells is the design and synthesis of novel donor materials. A series of synthesized alternating copolymers are described, containing 2 -decylseleno(3, 2 -c) thiophene as the donor and fluorene, benzene or benzothiadiazole as the acceptor. The benzothiadiazole-containing copolymer shows the best spectral overlap with the solar spectrum among the three synthesized. Furthermore, the copolymers show deeper HOMO values compared to the homopolymer poly[2 -decylseleno(3, 2 -c) thiophene]. The power conversion efficiency predictions made using Schaber 2 ̆ 7 s model reveals that these copolymers are good donor materials for fullerene-based BHJ solar cells. ^ An organic-processable copper phthalocyanine-surfactant complex was prepared as a donor material for BHJ solar cells. The fullerene-based solar cells made using this complex as the donor were compared to those made with poly(3 -hexylthiophene) a. k. a P 3 HT as the donor. Even though the efficiencies of the copper phthalocyanine solar cells were low compared to the P 3 HT solar cells, this approach provides a facile way to make small molecular solar cells. ^ On a different note, DNA 2 ̆ 7 s complex with the cationic surfactant <b>cetyltrimethylammonium</b> (CTMA) <b>bromide</b> was utilized for photonic and environmental applications. The studies on hemicyanine dye (Hemi- 22) loaded thin films of DNA-CTMA and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) showed that Hemi 22 demonstrates high photostability and reduced aggregate formation in DNA-CTMA compared to PMMA. An efficient cascade Förster resonance energy transfer was also realized in a solid-state matrix of DNA-CTMA using a three-dye system, without any necessity for covalent attachments. The improved energy transfer efficiency {{can be attributed to the}} ability of DNA to interact with the encapsulated dyes, and to provide the required proximity and orientation. ^ In addition to photonic applications of DNA-CTMA, its environmental applications were explored by preparing a DNA-magnetite hybrid with DNA-CTMA and oleic acid coated magnetite nanoparticles. This hybrid was fabricated into uniform and high surface area nanofibers, which were used to remove organic and inorganic toxicants from aqueous media. The superparamagnetic behavior of the hybrid nanofibers enabled fast and easy separation under an external magnetic field. ...|$|R
