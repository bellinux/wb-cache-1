50|$|The <b>conical</b> <b>refiner</b> is {{a chamber}} with metal bars mounted around {{the inside of}} the container. The {{material}} to be refined is pumped into the chamber at high-pressure rate in order to create an abrasive effect as the material is forced through the machine, abraided by the metal bars. At {{the opposite end of the}} chamber the resulting pulp is pumped out.|$|E
40|$|Widely used in {{the early}} 1900 s, conical {{refiners}} have been reworked to eliminate high energy requirement, tendency to cut short fibers Early in the 20 th Century, <b>conical</b> <b>refining</b> evolved away from beaters used for fiber defibrillation (i. e., why some mills still call the refining area "the beater room"). The conical fit {{the requirements of the}} time quite well, because it was very good for shortening the long, non-wood fibers then in use. The conical continued to be applicable for stock refining into the 1960 s because, as wood fibers began to replace non-wood fibers, long fiber softwoods were used, and cutting was still desired. However, the tackle system of the older conical refiners limited their ability to fibrillate without cutting. This became more and more of a drawback as short-fiber hardwoods entered the stock furnish. The shorter hardwood fibers require fibrillation with minimal or no cutting to achieve their best papermaking potential. Refining intensities down to 0. 2 Ws/M are recommended, 1 and this is usually not possible with the older style conicals...|$|R

It {{is shown}} that bounded {{solutions}} to semilinear elliptic Fuchsian equations obey complete asymptotic expansions {{in terms of}} powers and logarithms in {{the distance to the}} boundary.

40|$|Low {{consistency}} (LC) refining {{and high}} consistency refining (HC) {{has been studied}} in a TMP mill. When strength properties were increased, the development of fiber properties was different in LC- and HC-refining. Fiber curl decreased in LC-refining but increased in HC-refining. LC-refining decreased fiber curl and increased tensile index simultaneously in this study. It is therefore likely that the decreased fiber curl contributes to the increase of tensile index in LC-refining. Furthermore, fiber wall thickness decreased and external fibrillation increased in HC-refining, while these properties were only slightly influenced in the LC-refining. Fibrillation was found to decrease in most cases for LC-refining while fiber wall thickness index increased slightly but consistently, which might indicate a less dense structure of the fiber wall or its surface layers. Double-disc HC-refining with the same energy input as in a <b>conical</b> single-disc <b>refiner</b> resulted in fibers of higher external fibrillation, lower fiber wall thickness and higher fiber curl at a given fiber length. The results indicate that analyzing individual fiber dimensions could be a better tool for understanding how fibers develop in different kinds of refining than analyzing conventional handsheet properties...|$|R

40|$|Työssä selvitettiin kahden erilaisen jauhinterätyypin toimivuutta. Testattiin OptiFiner Pro-kartiojauhimeen uutta terää ja TwinFlo-levyjauhimeen tarkoitettua puristusjauhatusterää. Selvitettiin myös mäntysellun lujuuspotentiaalia ja käsiarkkien kuivatusmenetelmien eroavaisuuksia. Kirjallisuusosassa tarkasteltiin taivekartongin rakennetta, sellun jauhatusta ja kuitujen käyttäytymistä jauhatuksessa. Käsiteltiin myös yleistä jauhatusteoriaa ja puristusjauhatusta, sekä työssä käytettyjä jauhintyyppejä. Työn kokeellisessa osassa tutkittiin koivu-/mäntyselluista tehtyjen käsiarkkien ominaisuuksia. Tavoitteena oli selvittää saadaanko uusilla OptiFiner Pro:n terillä parempaa vetolujuutta. Nitrobar-koeterillä tavoitteena oli myös parantaa vetolujuutta, mutta myös selvittää koeterien puristusjauhatusmenetelmän toimivuutta. Kokeellisessa osassa ilmeni, että vetolujuus ei parantunut OptiFiner Pro:n terillä. Nitrobar-koeterillä ei saatu toivottua vaikutusta aikaiseksi, eli puristusjauhatusmenetelmä ei onnistunut. Syynä saattoi olla liian kovat teräkuormat. Työssä selvisi, että jatkotutkimuksia ja kehitystä molemmilla terillä kannattaa jatkaa. Näiden tutkimusten perusteella osoittautui myös, että käsiarkkien kuivatusmenetelmillä ei ole huomattavia kutistumiseroja ja että mäntysellulla on vielä lujuuspotentiaalia, eli sitä kannattaa jauhaa enemmän. Two {{different}} kinds of refiner plates were tested in this work. One of the plates tested was for an OptiFiner Pro <b>conical</b> <b>refiner</b> {{and the other for}} a TwinFlo disk refiner. The test-plates for the disk refiner were designed for internal refining. In both cases of the tests, the objective was to attain higher tensile strength to the product. The tensile strength potential of pine pulp and differences between two drying methods of hand sheets were also evaluated. The profile of folding boxboard, refining of pulp and the impact on the fibres before and after refining was discussed in the theory part of the work. The most common refining theories and theory behind internal refining was also discussed, likewise the refiners use in this work. The features of the hand sheets were deliberated in the experimental study. The main goal was to determine if the pulp obtained better tensile strength during the refining with the OptiFiner Pro plates. This was also the case with the Nitrobar internal reining plates, but the aim was also to examine the performance of the internal refining technique. In the experimental study {{it turned out that the}} tensile strength did not developed with the OptiFiner Pro test plates. A desired effect did not either occur with the Nitrobar plates. The conclusion is that the internal refining technique did not work in this case. The result of this study is that further development and trials are needed to accomplish the targets of both refining plates. Furthermore, there were no significant differences between the two drying methods in order of shrinkage and the pine pulp could be refined further to optimize its tensile strength potential...|$|E
