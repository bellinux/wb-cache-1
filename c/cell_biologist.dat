40|$|High-throughput omics {{technologies}} generate huge datasets on the protein, transcript, lipid, and metabolite {{content of}} cells. By integrating and analyzing these data, systems biologists study complex networks {{of physical and}} functional interactions that go beyond the traditional focus on individual proteins or linear pathways. Many <b>cell</b> <b>biologists</b> have greeted these developments with healthy skepticism, complaining that long lists of genes or “hairballs” of interactions provide little insight into biological questions of genuine meaning. As omics techniques move beyond acquisition into hypothesis-driven applications, the chasm between systems <b>biologists</b> and <b>cell</b> <b>biologists</b> is narrowing {{and the benefits of}} working together are increasingly clear. While <b>cell</b> <b>biologists</b> need omics and computer analyses to extend their understanding of biological processes, omics scientists need <b>cell</b> <b>biologists</b> to help them interpret and use their vast amounts of data...|$|R

Or, the {{so-called}} “self-renewal ” of stem cells is just a self-cheating of <b>cell</b> <b>biologists?</b> “Self-renewal ” has been claimed as a defining feature for stem cells. However, this so-called hallmark feature is not only non-exclusive for stem cells but also untrue for stem cells. The “self-renewing” capability in fact is a common capability for all cells to reproduce them selves.
