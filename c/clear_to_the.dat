5|$|By this time, on {{both the}} Eastern and Western Front, the {{activities}} of the SS were becoming <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Allies, as the concentration and extermination camps were being overrun.

5|$|At 05:00 on 15 May a German {{messenger}} reached The Hague, inviting Winkelman to Rijsoord for {{a meeting}} with von Küchler to negotiate the articles of a written capitulation document. Both quickly agreed on most conditions, Winkelman declaring to have surrendered army, naval and air forces. When von Küchler demanded that pilots still fighting for the allies should be treated as francs-tireurs—seen by the Germans as guerilla fighters outside the laws of war—Winkelman's refusal made it <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Germans that only the armed forces in the homeland, with the exception of Zealand, would capitulate, not the country itself. On other points a swift agreement was reached and the document was signed at 10:15.|$|E
5|$|By 26 December, strong German defences had stalled Canadian {{forces in}} Ortona and British and New Zealand forces in Orsogna. Although both Ortona and Villa Grande were {{captured}} {{by the end of}} December, general exhaustion among the Allied forces prevented the capture of Orsogna and an advance to Pescara. When harsh winter weather set in, it became <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Allied commanders that no further progress would be made and General Alexander called off the offensive.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, when Bauer {{again was}} asked to {{illustrate}} the book, he made it <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> publisher {{that he wanted to}} retain his pictures along with the copyrights after publication. The publishing house had kept the original illustrations for the previous editions and considered them their property. Bauer was backed up in his request by other artists facing the same problem. The publishers did not budge from their position and without Bauer's illustrations, book sales dropped.|$|E

5|$|Malta was {{invaded by}} the French First Republic in June 1798, and the Order was {{expelled}} from the island, resulting in the French occupation of Malta. Grand Master Hompesch was pressured to capitulate, as the Maltese nobility and the Magistrate of the Castellania, together with influential and high ranking figures made it <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Fiscal of the Castellania that, unless he surrenders, those resisting the French would have to simultaneously face an internal revolution. The French reformed the legal system with the country being divided into provinces for roughly each 3,000 inhabitants, all with their own Justice of Peace.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the British {{government}} {{comes under}} public pressure {{to resolve the}} problem. It becomes <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> British diplomats assigned {{to find a solution}} that defeating the Burgundians through starvation is both difficult and unpopular with the British people, so they negotiate. The sticking point {{turns out to be the}} disposition of the unearthed treasure. Wix, now the Burgundian Chancellor of the Exchequer, suggests a Burgundian loan of the treasure to Britain. With the final piece of the deadlock eliminated, Burgundy reunites with Britain, which also sees the return of rationing for food and clothing to the area. The celebratory outdoor banquet is interrupted by heavy rain.|$|E

While he showed occasional signs {{of his old}} form that season, it became <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Browns' coaching staff {{that he was no}} longer in his prime. Motley finished the year with 444 yards of rushing and 4.3 yards per carry, a career low. The Browns finished with an 8–4 record but still captured the conference title and secured another spot in the NFL championship game. Motley performed well in that matchup against the Detroit Lions, rushing for 95 yards. The Browns, however, lost 17–7.|$|E

5|$|On 9 July {{a meeting}} between Kluge, Model, Joachim Lemelsen and Josef Harpe {{was held at the}} {{headquarters}} of the XLVII Panzer Corps.

5|$|The {{importance}} of 'joint' warfare was made <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Australian military during World War II when Australian naval, ground and air units frequently served {{as part of}} single commands. Following the war, several senior officers lobbied for {{the appointment of a}} {{commander in chief of the}} three services. The government rejected this proposal and the three services remained fully independent. The absence of a central authority resulted in poor co-ordination between the services, with each service organising and operating on the basis of a different military doctrine.|$|E
5|$|A bicycle-mounted {{detachment}} of the 183rd Infantry Division captured Murska Sobota without encountering resistance. During the day, the German Luftwaffe bombed and strafed Yugoslav positions and {{troops on the}} march. By the afternoon, German troops had captured Dolnja Lendava, and by the evening it had become <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Germans that the Yugoslavs would not be resisting stubbornly at the border. XLVI Motorised Corps was then ordered to begin seizing bridges over the Mura at Mursko Središće and Letinja, and over the Drava at Gyékényes and Barcs. The local attacks were sufficient to inflame dissent within the largely Croat 4th Army, who refused to resist Germans they considered their liberators from Serbian oppression during the interwar period. In the afternoon, German Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers of Sturzkampfgeschwader 77 escorted by Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighters caught the Breguet 19s of the 4th Air Reconnaissance Group {{on the ground at}} Velika Gorica, destroying most of them.|$|E

5|$|According to Roberts, it {{is clear}} that the next phase of {{negotiations}} was intended to go beyond prisoner exchanges, as the prisoner of war negotiator Stilinović was not involved. Đilas and Velebit were passed through the German lines to Sarajevo and were then flown to Zagreb on 25 March in a military aircraft. These negotiations were with German representatives supervised by Ott, apparently on all the points discussed at Gornji Vakuf, and the Partisans made it <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Germans that their proposals did not amount to an offer of surrender. Velebit met personally with Glaise-Horstenau, as the Austrian had known Velebit's father, a Yugoslav general. After this first visit to Zagreb, Velebit visited Partisan commanders in Slavonia and eastern Bosnia passing on orders for the suspension of attacks on the Germans and their rail communications, and the release of prisoners.|$|E
5|$|According to the Venetian senator Andrea Suriano, Venice {{spent on}} average 60,000 ducats {{per year in}} this {{seemingly}} fruitless conflict, but the Venetians themselves were hesitant to commit their resources fully to Thessalonica; its proximity to the centre of Ottoman power made their ability to retain it doubtful in the long term, {{while at the same}} time, closer to home, Venice was pursuing a conflict with the Duchy of Milan over control of northern Italy. The Republic had long tried to avoid declaring war on the Ottomans, but now it had little choice: Dandolo's imprisonment, the increasing Ottoman naval threat (with the open assistance of the Genoese colonies at Chios and Lesbos), in conjunction with the end of their war with Hungary, made <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Venetians that the Sultan was preparing to settle the question of Thessalonica by force. As a result, on 29 March 1429, the Great Council voted an official declaration of war against the Sultan, and ordered more ships to be activated to join the fleet.|$|E
5|$|After the German {{invasion}} of Norway and Denmark, {{followed by a}} warning by the new Japanese naval attaché Captain Tadashi Meada that a German attack on the Netherlands was certain, it became <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Dutch military that staying out of the conflict might prove impossible. They started to fully prepare for war, both mentally and physically. Dutch border troops were put on greater alert. Reports of the presumed actions of a Fifth Column in Scandinavia caused widespread fears that the Netherlands too had been infiltrated by German agents assisted by traitors. Countermeasures were taken against a possible assault on airfields and ports. On 19 April {{a state of emergency}} was declared. However, most civilians still cherished the illusion that their country might be spared, an attitude that has since been described as a state of denial. The Dutch hoped that the restrained policy of the Entente and Central Powers during the First World War might be repeated and tried to avoid the attention of the Great Powers and a war in which they feared a loss of human life comparable to that of the previous conflict. On 10 April Britain and France repeated their request that the Dutch enter the war on their side, but were again refused.|$|E

5|$|Although O'Malley was {{loyal to}} his {{employees}}, {{he did not}} take kindly to demands from employees such as manager Charlie Dressen's request for a three-year contract. When Dressen requested a multi-year contract after losing a second consecutive World Series to the Yankees, he was released. Then when he hired Walter Alston as a replacement, he made it <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> press that Alston would only receive one-year contracts and would not attempt to show up the management in the national media. There were rumors that Alston even signed blank contracts in the fall and showed up in the spring to find out his salary. O'Malley also did not support those who remained friends with Rickey, which was a large factor in Red Barber quitting as Dodgers announcer.|$|E
5|$|Early on 6 April 1941, the German XLVI Motorised Corps {{launched}} preliminary attacks {{along the}} Drava between Ždala and Gotalovo {{in the area}} of the 27th Infantry Division Savska with the intention of securing crossings over the river, but they were unsuccessful. By the evening, German successes along the Hungarian border made it <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Germans that the Yugoslavs would not be resisting stubbornly at the frontier. The XLVI Motorised Corps was then ordered to begin seizing bridges over the Drava right along the 4th Army front, including at Zákány near Gyékényes. These local attacks were sufficient to inflame dissent within the largely Croat 4th Army, who refused to resist the Germans which they considered their liberators from Serbian oppression during the interwar period.|$|E
5|$|German Army {{headquarters}} {{wanted to}} capture the bridges over the Drava intact, and from 1 April had issued orders to the 2nd Army to conduct preliminary operations aimed at seizing the bridge at Barcs and the railway bridge northeast of Koprivnica by coup de main. As a result, limited objective attacks were launched {{along the line of}} the Drava by the XLVI Motorised Corps, {{despite the fact that they}} were not expected to launch offensive operations until 10 April. During the day, the German Luftwaffe bombed and strafed Yugoslav positions and troops on the march, and by the evening it had become <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Germans that the Yugoslavs would not be resisting stubbornly at the border. XLVI Motorised Corps was then ordered to begin seizing bridges over the Drava, including at Barcs.
