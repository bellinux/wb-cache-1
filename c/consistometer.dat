The objectives were to evaluate the potential use of the mixograph and farinograph to study DMF mixing and hydration properties and also to evaluate the use of the Rapid Visco Analyzer (RVA), <b>consistometer</b> and penetrometer to study DMF properties. The effect of sample size, moisture level, mixing speed, temperature, particle size distribution and CMC level on the mixing characteristics of DMF were evaluated. Reformulated and commercial flours with and without CMC were also evaluated using a <b>consistometer,</b> penetrometer, RVA and also were subjectively evaluated for their machinability properties. Reduced moisture levels produced firmer masas which produced higher and wider curves. At increased moisture levels masa develops maximum consistency and stickiness faster. Excess water produced soft masas that exhibited decreased maximum consistency. Three stages were observed during mixing. The first stage involves hydration of the DMF causing the curve to go up. During the second stage, masa develops cohesiveness; the curve becomes wider and reaches maximum consistency. During the third stage, masa becomes sticky due to overmixing and the curve becomes narrower and lower. Mixing stages were developed at different times reflecting differences among DMF. Finer DMF required less mixing time to reach maximum consistency and to develop stickiness, whereas coarser flours produced firmer masas with increased maximum consistency. Masas from DMF containing 0. 5 % CMC exhibited the highest maximum consistency, while time to reach maximum consistency increased along with CMC level. Reduced penetrometer readings and shorter distances traveled in the <b>consistometer,</b> as well as increased viscosities in the RVA were significantly correlated to increased maximum consistency in the mixograph and farinograph. Subjective machinability determinations were also significantly correlated to mixograph and farinograph parameters. The mixograph and farinograph are simple techniques with acceptable repeatability to detect differences in mixing characteristics of DMF. Mixograph and farinograph as well as <b>consistometer,</b> penetrometer and RVA have potential for rapid evaluation of DMF properties and mixing performance in a quality control program...|$|E

30|$|As {{one of the}} {{important}} information of the rheology, the viscoelastic properties are associated with the slurry microstructure. Several researchers have investigated viscoelastic properties of cement slurry mixtures. Tattersall and Banfill (1983) demonstrated that the paste undergoes the breakdown of structure while the amplitude of shear increases. Cooke et al. (1988) examined viscoelastic parameters for both flowing and curing cement slurries. Chow et al. (1988) discussed the use of the viscoelastic parameters as an alternative to <b>consistometer</b> studies. Saaka et al. (2001) measured viscoelastic properties of cement paste, and illustrated the effect of wall slip on the shear yield stress. Figura and Prud’homme (2010) considered the viscoelastic response of cements with curing-rate control additives. However, little {{attention has been paid to}} the viscoelastic properties of flowing materials for examining the flow behaviors, particularly in the pumping industry.|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{find the}} effect lost {{circulation}} materials has on cement slurries through testing in viscometer, pressurised <b>consistometer</b> and static gel strength analyser at selected concentrations. A worksheet containing a basic cement slurry recipe was used as basis for comparison against the slurries containing lost circulation material. SafeCarb 250, OptiSeal II, OptiSeal IV and G-Seal were the materials used to obtain the results for this thesis. The chosen concentrations for lost circulation material were, by recommendation, 100 kg/m^ 3, 150 kg/m^ 3 and 200 kg/m^ 3. For the thickening time and compressive strength tests, only the highest and lowest concentrations were chosen. All three concentrations were used when conducting tests on the viscometer. The rheology of the slurries were tested in the viscometers subjected to surface and downhole conditions. It was found that OptiSeal II, containing both graphite and calcium carbonate, had 73, 5 % higher viscosity and 15, 24 % higher yield stress at surface conditions compared to the base slurry. G-Seal, containing coarse-sized graphite, had 100 % higher viscosity and 56, 4 % higher yield stress at downhole conditions. OptiSeal IV, a calcium carbonate, showed the overall lowest values compared to the base slurry with 28, 1 % lower yield stress at surface conditions, 32 % lower yield stress and 8, 36 % lower viscosity at downhole conditions. Thickening times were tested in a pressurised <b>consistometer.</b> Tests showed that the addition of SafeCarb 250, a calcium carbonate, decreased thickening time with 18 % as concentrations of SafeCarb increased. Compressive strengths were tested in a static gel strength analyser. All materials containing calcium carbonate achieved a higher compressive strength than the base slurry. OptiSeal II was 47, 5 % higher than base slurry on the highest concentration. G-Seal had a 34 % lower compressive strength on the lowest concentration but exceeded the base slurry again at the highest concentration...|$|E

This work is on how mixing energy and shear rate affect the thickening time of cement slurry. Using conventional pressurized <b>consistometer,</b> fitted with a variable speed motor, a comparative thickening time test was obtained. This device allows for simulation of shear rate, temperature and pressure found in the well bore during pumping. The API procedure {{was used to evaluate}} the mixing energy applied to the slurry. Results obtained show that for mixing energy, the principal thing is deflocculation. Once the slurry is deflocculated, then no other effect of mixing energy is felt on the thickening time and it is not a function of the geometry of wellbore. Results also show that the temperature profile and geometry of the well from surface to bottom is an important consideration in modeling the influence of shear on how long the cement slurry will remain pumpable. Modeling along this line will lead to optimum slurry quality and design...|$|E

The consistency of complementary food {{is of particular}} importance for infants who cannot masticate and therefore, depend on liquid or semi solid foods. In Nigeria mothers regard cereal malting and supplementation with legume as extra-labor. Increase of gruel energy density is important to improve the energy intake of young children in developing countries. This study investigated the effect of malting and co-fermentation bi-component flour (co-fermented maize/cowpea 70 : 30 w/w) on {{the consistency of the}} gruel product. Five processes in which either of the grain is germinated, un-germinated, un-germinated and boiled, un-germinated boiled, wet-milled and sieved before co-fermentation were explored.

Abstract The {{purpose of this study}} was to produce an acceptable dessert product that met the dietary needs of an individual with an egg allergy. Three variations of pumpkin bars were analyzed to determine sensory and objective differences in taste, mouthfeel, overall acceptability, batter viscosity, and springiness that resulted due to the elimination of eggs in the recipe. The experimental variations consisted of a replacement of eggs with ground flaxseed, a replacement of eggs with sweet potato baby food, and a control recipe utilizing eggs. Samples of each variation’s batter were subjected to viscosity testing using a Bostwick <b>Consistometer.</b> The distance that each 30 mL batter sample travelled was recorded at two and four minutes. Once the pumpkin bars were baked and cooled, they were cut into 1 ”x 1 ” squares for sensory analysis. A total of thirty-nine participants completed a randomized taste test of the pumpkin bars and filled out a ballot to rate the samples on a four-point Likert scale for taste, mouthfeel, and overall acceptability.

40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to {{determine}} the water-binding capacity of each individual trimming in a multicomponent system. Three types of experimental cooked sausages (finely chopped luncheon sausage, coarsely chopped sausage and ring sausage with potato starch) were made of five different meat trimmings: two pork trimmings and two beef trimmings, and one beef trimming used as a replacer. The water-binding was determined by the Tuominen-Honkavaara method by stepwise addition of water (basic formulation and four water additions) to the formulations and determining the firmness by a <b>consistometer.</b> The water-binding of each trimming was obtained by replacing the trimming by an additional trimming. A total of 3 sausage types x 5 meat trimmings x 5 water levels giving 75 experimental batches of five kg each were made. The average water-binding values of the same meat trimming combination in each sausage type were practically the same, and therefore the total averages for the same meat trimming combinations of each of the three sausage types were used for the subsequent calculations. The determination of the water-binding values of the meat trimmings were solved by forming five equations with four unknowns each, and then solving the unknowns using Microsoft Excel's ‘Solver’ function. By this procedure it was possible to determine the water-binding of individual meat trimmings in sausage systems. This procedure can be used for the determination of the technological properties of meats for linear programming. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is based on the investigation of the use of short fibres in structural concrete to enhance the mechanical properties of concrete. The objective {{of the study was to}} determine and compare the differences in properties of concrete containing no fibres and concrete with fibres, as well as the comparison on the effects of different type and geometry of fibres to the concrete. This investigation was carried out using several tests, which included workability test, compressive test, indirect tensile test, flexural test and modulus of elasticity test. A total of ten mix batches of concrete containing 0 %, 0. 5 %, 1. 0 % and 1. 5 % fibre volume dosage rate on 'wave cut' steel fibres, high performance polypropylene fibres and Fibremesh were tested to determine the enhancement of mechanical properties of concrete. The workability of concrete significantly reduced as the fibre dosage rate increases. This was assessed through standard slump test, compacting factor test and VEBE <b>consistometer</b> test. Results of compressive strength test indicated that the use of fibre in concrete might not efficiently increase in strength. In flexural and indirect tensile test showed specimens with fibres that drastic increase in strength from specimens without fibres. A moderate increase in modulus of elasticity of the fibre reinforced concrete was indicated in modulus of elasticity test. The usage of fibres were fully utilised when it comes to post-cracking stage, as it increase on ductility and toughness of concrete. This was examined through the load/deformation curve of flexural strength test and stress/strain diagram of modulus of elasticity test. It was found that different type and geometry of fibres influence the mechanical properties of concrete in a different manner. As to create a cost efficient fibre reinforced structure, these changes on fibres are vital to the design and construction. However, further investigations were highly recommended and should be carried out to understand more mechanical properties of fibre reinforced concrete...|$|E
40|$|Oil {{companies}} need {{to evaluate the}} risk of annular fluid or gas migration if cement fails during {{the life of the}} well. Sustained casing pressure can lead to shutting in the wells to avoid health, safety, and environment (HSE) risks and government fines. To understand the long-term integrity of cement in high temperature and high pressure (HTHP) conditions and the mechanical properties that affect the ability of cements to seal fluids, this project used finite-element models (FEMs) to study the stress-causing phenomena. FEM analyses in ABAQUS version 6. 11 were used to determine the potential of cement failure in oil wells. The model uses a 3 D section of a well {{that can be used for}} different casing and formation types under different loading conditions. The model built in ABAQUS version 6. 11 allows incorporating materials with nonlinear mechanical properties; it also uses FEM analysis to forecast fractures inside the cement under different loading scenarios like hydraulic fracture jobs or casing tests. The finite-element model included cases for cement cracking, cement debonding, and plastic deformation of the cement and rock that can generate loss of zonal isolation. Linear manner: set cements behave elastically until a failure criterion is reached, and then they can behave plastically. The FEM approach can reproduce stresses, strains, and volume changes in the material under different environmental HTHP conditions. Cemented wells have both tensile and compressive stresses that make some parts of the cement sheath experience fracture initiation, plastic deformation, or debonding. This dissertation provides a model that will help drillers design the set cement for long-term integrity in HPHT well conditions. The FEM predicts if the cement sheath can develop debonding, cracks or plastic deformations during the life of the well. The cement sheath needs to be designed for long-term zonal isolation to avoid interzonal communications, remedial costs and environmental problems related to cement seal. A CMS?- 300 Automated Permeameter, a mechanical properties analyzer, HPHT cement <b>consistometer,</b> annular expansion molds, and tri-axial test equipment were used in this study to test cements for specific applications in three Colombian oil fields, including an oil field with in-situ combustion project...|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringBoth {{ultrasound}} and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) {{have previously}} been investigated {{for the potential}} of monitoring barite sag in drilling fluids. The Ultrasonic Cement Analyzer (UCA) registers the speed of ultrasound waves travelling through a media, which {{is dependent on the}} speed of sound of the base fluid, density stratification, particle concentration, shape and size. The NMR measures the longitudinal and transverse relaxation time of the fluid, being dependent on three relaxation mechanisms. These are bulk relaxation, depending upon physical properties such as viscosity; surface relaxation, that accounts for the effect of contact between fluid and solids; and relaxation due to molecular diffusion. An experimental study has been performed with the aim to investigate the ability of these two apparatus to detect sag in low sag potential drilling fluids with micronized barite. Experiments have been carried out on four different oil water ratios. Direct weight measurement has been performed using a modified atmospheric <b>consistometer,</b> in order to evaluate the behavior of the particles in the drilling fluid at a static condition. Comparison of the results from the UCA and the NMR with the direct weight measurement have indicated possibilities and restrictions in the use of these two methods. The UCA has showed potential in detecting accumulation of particles, as sediment beds are formed {{at the bottom of the}} test cell. A clear trend with an increasing transit time was indicated to take place after accumulation of approximately 3 grams of particles. 1 D profile experiments performed by the use of a bench-top NMR spectrometer have shown potential in detecting sediment accumulation at the bottom of fluid samples. However, it seems like this test method may have a limited sensitivity restricting the gain in applying this test method on low sag potential drilling fluids. It has been observed that transverse relaxation time, T 2, changes with changing oil water ratio. As the number of signal peaks and their placement on the axis representing the relaxation time are probably representing hydrogen nuclei in different structural configurations, this measurement technique might also be applicable in emulsion stability analysis...|$|E
