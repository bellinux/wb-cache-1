5|$|An {{enormous}} {{variety of}} genomic structures <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>among</b> viral species; as a group, they contain more structural genomic diversity than plants, animals, archaea, or bacteria. There {{are millions of}} different types of viruses, although only about 5,000 types have been described in detail. As of September 2015, the NCBI Virus genome database has more than 75,000 complete genome sequences. but there are doubtlessly many more to be discovered.|$|E

José Carioca and Panchito Pistoles, never having seen Mickey Mouse, ask Donald what is wrong, but Donald replies he is just tired. Later in the same story, the Caballeros free several animals from a poacher. One panel shows the animals fleeing; Mickey <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>among</b> them.|$|E
25|$|Indigenous {{military}} organization also encompasses Africa’s substantial cavalry or mounted tradition, {{from the}} armored chevaliers of Western Africa, {{to the desert}} horsemen of North Africa, to the mounted fighters of the Basotho in their southern redoubts. On {{the waters of the}} continent, naval activities must be accounted for, not simply canoe transport, but fighting vessels, ports, and troop landings covered by poisoned arrows, bullets and cannonballs. Different styles of warfare and modes of organization are also demonstrated by indigenous systems, from the patient tactical defensive of the Basotho, the elaborate armies of Ashanti, the sweeping offensive horns of the Zulu impi, and the protracted guerrilla styles and archery of forest peoples like the Lobi, or the San (Bushmen) further south. As regards styles of organization, different approaches over different eras <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen.</b> <b>Among</b> the Kongo kingdoms of the 18th century for example, a mixture of unit types was deployed – heavy infantry with strong shields for example, backed by lighter contingents armed with bows and spears. Special units of elite troops and bodyguards were also maintained. Like the reorganized Roman legions of old however, the later Zulu system dispensed with such distinctions in favor of one streamlined combat organization and method. Such standardized methods were to be copied by other tribes, and were to dominate or influence large parts of southern Africa and beyond during the 19th century. Such complexity again illustrates that African military systems cannot be conceived of in static, one-dimensional terms.|$|E

25|$|The spiral-horned antelopes are {{medium to}} large antelopes and {{generally}} are tall and long-legged. Horns {{are present in}} the males of all species, while females lack them with the exception of bongos and elands. The horns primarily role is used for defensive horn-wrestling which are common during territorial disputes, as well has for horn soiling and sexual display. Other examples of extreme sexual dimorphism <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>among</b> spiral-horned antelopes. Males are much larger in size than the females, and both sexes have very contrasting pelage coloration. The coloration in females is generally tan to red-brown. Males area a darker hue of the female coloration, which they darken as the animal gets older. Regardless of the coloration of the sexes, most species of spiral-horned antelopes have disruptive coloration that is a distinctive white vertical barring (striped pattern). A spotting pattern can occur as well. Both patterns are individually and geographically variable. These patterns help them to conceal themselves in the dense vegetation from predators. Most species have a white chevron between the eyes, spotted cheeks, the throat having a white patch and the upper-forelegs with dark garters. All except the nyala and the greater kudu have a chest crescent. In addition there are also physical attributes that serve a purpose in social communication such as dorsal crests, white scuts and white tips on the horns. These features help express the animal’s emotions as well as alerting members of the herd from predators. Underneath the hair fringe in the hind feet are special glands that encircles the false hooves.|$|E
25|$|Until the {{initiation}} ceremony and induction into {{the society and}} the receiving of the word, the horseman who were not {{members of the society}} but potential candidates would have trouble with horses. This would often be caused by older ploughmen who were members of the society tampering with their horses. They would put things like tacks under the horse's collar to cause it to behave irrationally. This would be unknown to the potential candidate as the techniques for training and controlling the horses were not yet given to him. Most of these techniques were based on the horse's sharp sense of smell. Foul substances placed in front of the horse or on the animal itself would cause it to refuse to move forward. This technique is known as jading and is still used by horse trainers today. There were also pleasant smelling things that were used to make a horse move forward or calm down. If the substance was an oil it could be wiped on the trainer's forehead, they would then {{stand in front of the}} animal and the smell would draw it towards them. This practice was often used in taming unruly horses. There were also pleasant smelling and inviting materials, such as sweets, that the horseman could keep in their pocket in order to calm, attract, and subdue a crazed horse. Keeping these techniques secret, along with the myth that there was a word that only the horseman knew that gave them and them alone power over horses helped guarantee their reputation, prestige, job security, and pay. The same type of logic and protection of trade secrets <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>among</b> modern magicians who keep their tricks secret and only share them with other members of their trade.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} blunders <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>among</b> the early coins {{produced}} at the Mint under Longacre, {{though it is}} uncertain to whom these errors should be attributed. [...] These include the 1844 half dollar struck at the New Orleans Mint (1844-O) with a doubled date, and the 1846 half dollar with the 6 overlying an identical digit, but one which had been placed horizontally. [...] Bowers indicates that Longacre likely delegated such work, although in 1849 he wrote that his daily work was punching dates into working dies. [...] Tom DeLorey, in his 2003 article on Longacre, notes that Peale and his staff often made punches without consulting the Engraver's Department (headed by Longacre), and believes the chief coiner {{more likely to be}} responsible.|$|E

500|$|Peter, {{who tries}} to shave Quagmire's cat in the episode, ends up killing it and cutting it six times because of the legend of cats having nine lives. As he is arresting Brian, one of the police {{officers}} states {{that he will not}} release him since he is a [...] "family guy". In their campaign, Brian and Stewie perform their musical number, '"A Bag o' Weed", to the tune of [...] "Me Ol' Bamboo" [...] as featured in the film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. During the song, a picture of Woody Harrelson is shown. Harrelson also wanted marijuana legalized. Towards the end of the musical number Shaggy from the television show Scooby Doo <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>among</b> the crowd, referencing a number of jokes about his stoned-like demeanor. After cannabis is legalized, its effects include phenomenal ratings for Doctor Who. Peter then tries to remember something but ends up remembering the names of celebrities whom he does not like. While helping out with Carter's smear campaign, Peter comes up with an advertisement that involves Adolf Hitler claiming that the Holocaust was started by smoking cannabis. The campaign is then dropped after Carter informs Peter that Fox News holds Hitler's image rights and they cannot smear it. He later tries to film a new advertisement which informs that unlike the events of the film Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, he made it there earlier since he was not stoned. He then says Neil Patrick Harris was cast on How I Met Your Mother based on his work in that film, and brings up a point that confuses him: since Josh Radnor is already an adult, why is the narrator of the show voiced by Bob Saget? Carter later tells Brian that he will release his novel with an Oprah's Book Club induction.|$|E
