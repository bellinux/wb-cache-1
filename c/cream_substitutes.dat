5000|$|Simplesse {{began in}} 1979 as [...] "a {{substance}} that gelled like egg white but crumbled like Styrofoam." [...] At that time, Shoji Yamamoto, {{an associate of}} Norman S. Singer at Canadian beer company John Labatt Ltd. in London, Ontario, brought Singer the whey protein substance. After sensing that it gave the taste texture of cream cheese, another scientist put a sample under a powerful microscope and saw [...] "tiny spheres of protein rolling over each other" [...] about a tenth the size of particles of powdered sugar. It was this particle rolling action that gave a smooth creaminess sensation. Another associate of Singer, scientist Nina Davis, worked for three years with Simplesse (then called microcurd) to adapt it to and incorporate it into many different food products. After Singer's boss observed that the product tasted like cheesecake, Singer filed for and received a United States patent for his efforts with the product. Labatt licensed the product to NutraSweet, a subsidiary of Creve Coeur, Missouri, United States chemical conglomerate Monsanto, in 1984. The product was given the trademark [...] "Simplesse" [...] in January 1988. An initial version of the product, approved for use in frozen desserts like low-fat ice <b>cream</b> <b>substitutes</b> by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), {{was introduced to the}} public about that same time as being [...] "the first completely natural fat substitute." [...] The FDA approved a second version of the product in 1991 for use in salad dressings, butter, and baked goods.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to survey the fatty acid profiles of fat spreads, margarines, shortenings, vegetable fat ice creams, vegetable fat milk-based <b>cream</b> <b>substitutes,</b> vegetable fat cheese substitutes, and reduced-fat cheeses on the Finnish market. The evaluation of the nutritional quality of fat in these products is of significance to dieticians and to the development of fat products with enhanced nutritional value. Remarkable differences between fatty acid profiles of vegetable fat products were found. Vegetable fat ice creams may have a lot of saturated fat and, in addition, the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids may be very low. Vegetable fat half creams had, in general, less saturated fat and more polyunsaturated fatty acids than cream. The spreads and shortenings studied contained less than 2 % trans fatty acids of total fatty acids. Consumption of reduced-fat cheese in place of full-fat cheese does not negatively affect the nutritional quality of the consumed fat...|$|E

50|$|It {{is known}} that by the 1880s the Boston Cooler was being served in Detroit, made with the local Vernors.

50|$|The milk in bubble tea is optional, {{though many}} tea stores use it. Some cafés use a non-dairy <b>creamer</b> milk <b>substitute</b> instead of milk because many East Asians are lactose {{intolerant}} {{and because it}} is cheaper and easier to store and use than perishable milk. In Western countries, soy milk options are widely available for those who avoid dairy products. This adds a distinct flavor and consistency to the drink.Flavorings can be added to bubble tea. Some widely available fruit flavors include strawberry, green apple, passion fruit, mango, lemon, watermelon, grape, lychee, peach, pineapple, cantaloupe, honeydew, banana, avocado, coconut, kiwifruit, and jackfruit. Other popular non-fruit flavors include taro, pudding, chocolate, coffee, mocha, barley, sesame, almond, ginger, lavender, rose, caramel, violet, and Thai tea. Some of the sour fruit flavors are available in bubble tea without milk as the acidity tends to curdle the milk.|$|R

5000|$|Filled milk is any milk, cream, or {{skim milk}} {{that has been}} reconstituted with fats, usually {{vegetable}} oils, from sources other than dairy cows. [...] Pure evaporated filled milk is generally considered unsuitable for drinking because of its particular flavor, but is equivalent to unadulterated evaporated milk for baking and cooking purposes. Other filled milk products with substituted fat are used to make ice cream, sour cream, whipping <b>cream,</b> and half-and-half <b>substitutes</b> among other dairy products. Coconut oil filled milk became a popular cost-saving product sold throughout the United States in the early 20th century. Coconut oil could be cheaply imported, primarily from the Philippines (at the time under American rule), and this product was able to undercut the market for evaporated and condensed milk. At the time, liquid milk was not widely available or very popular because of the rarity of refrigeration and the problems of transportation and storage.|$|R
50|$|In Hungarian cuisine, {{sour cherry}} soup or meggyleves is a soup {{made from the}} fruits of the sour cherry tree (Prunus cerasus), and not from sweet cherries. The name is formed from hideg meaning 'cold', meggy meaning 'sour-cherries' / morellos, and leves meaning 'soup'. It is {{traditionally}} served as a dinner course, usually as either the appetizer, soup or dessert, on warm summer nights or for hot summer luncheons. The soup is cooked with whole sour cherries, including the pits. Sour cherry trees are numerous in Hungary, and the soup {{is a good example of}} the quintessentially Hungarian fusion of Eastern/Asian influences and traditional Continental European cuisine. It is customary that the soup contain fresh sour cherries, fresh cream and sometimes cloves and cinnamon. Canned regular cherries are sometimes added and sour <b>cream</b> is often <b>substituted</b> for fresh <b>cream.</b> A small amount of sweet white or dry red wine is also sometimes added before serving.

40|$|Ice cream {{has been}} {{manufactured}} commercially in the United States {{since the middle}} of the 19 th century. Ice cream and frozen dessert products comprise an important and relatively stable component of the United States dairy industry. As with many other dairy products, ice cream is differentiated in several dimensions. A censored translog demand system model was employed to analyze purchases of 3 ice cream product categories. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the effect that changes in retail prices and consumer income have on at-home ice cream consumption. The analysis was based on Nielsen 2005 home scan retail data and used marital status, age, race, education, female employment status, and location in the estimations of aggregate demand elasticities. Results revealed that price and consumer income were the main determinants of demand for ice cream products. Calculated own-price elasticities indicated relatively elastic responses by consumers for all categories except for compensated bulk ice cream. All expenditure elasticities were inelastic except for bulk ice cream, and most of the ice <b>cream</b> categories were <b>substitutes.</b> Ongoing efforts to examine consumer demand for these products will assist milk producers, dairy processors and manufacturers, and dairy marketers as they face changing consumer responses to food and diet issues. ...|$|R

Flavored non-dairy creamer made {{by combining the}} ingredients and additives that contribute to a milk-like taste. The objectives of this research were to determine the shelf life of flavored non-dairy creamer in three level temperatures using accelerated shelf life testing (ASLT) and to calculate the degradation rate of creamer during storage (Q 10). Other objectives {{of this research was}} to analyze the effect of different storage temperatures on the sensory, physical and chemical properties of creamer, as well as to evaluate the correlation among them. Flavored non-dairy creamers were stored in climatic chamber for 8 weeks at 40 oC and 16 weeks at 20 oC and 30 oC. The Relative Humidity (RH) was set at 75 %. The observations were done once a week for the products that were stored at 40 oC and every 2 weeks for product that was stored at 20 oC and 30 oC. The observed parameters were physical (coffee test, color, flowability and bulk density), chemical (moisture content, water activity, ash content, and fat content) and sensory (flavor overall and mouthfeel). The correlation analysis showed that the increasing of moisture content was followed by the increasing of water activity, sinkability, flowability, and bulk density. The shelf life of flavored non-dairy creamer based on moisture content was 69. 26 weeks at 20 oC, 21. 74 weeks at 30 oC, and 7. 35 weeks at 40 oC.
