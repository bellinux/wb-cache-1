5|$|The {{shedding}} {{of almost}} every doctrine the Worldwide Church of God once <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> is a story almost without parallel in American religious history.|$|E
5|$|From 1959 onwards, the LCL {{government}} <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> {{power with}} the support of two independents, as Labor gained momentum. Always at the forefront, Dunstan lambasted the government for perceived underspending on social welfare, education, health and the arts. Dunstan heavily promoted himself as a reformer.|$|E
5|$|He {{assumed the}} worst in people and he brought out {{the worst in}} them... He <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> {{the idea of being}} 'tough'. He thought that was what had brought him to the edge of greatness. But that was what betrayed him. He could not open himself to other men and he could not open himself to greatness.|$|E
60|$|As Hetty {{said the}} last words, she <b>clung</b> closer <b>to</b> Dinah, shuddering.|$|R
60|$|Our {{new friend}} <b>clung</b> tight <b>to</b> me. 'My husband!' she whispered, gasping.|$|R
60|$|Mapuhi's {{face was}} a ghastly yellow. He <b>clung</b> weakly <b>to</b> his wife.|$|R
5|$|Mississippi scored another {{touchdown}} before halftime, and the Hokies <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> a 1714 lead at {{the beginning}} of the second half. That three-point lead quickly evaporated, however, as 21seconds into the third quarter, Mississippi's Steve Hindman ran for 79yards and a touchdown to give Mississippi a 2117 lead. Ole Miss added 13 more points before the game ended and earned the victory, 3417.|$|E
5|$|Response to {{the reforms}} was mixed. The {{religious}} houses {{had been the}} only support of the impoverished, and the reforms alienated much of the population outside London, helping to provoke the great northern rising of 1536–1537, known as the Pilgrimage of Grace. Elsewhere the changes were accepted and welcomed, and those who <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> Catholic rites kept quiet or moved in secrecy. They would re-emerge during the reign of Henry's daughter Mary (1553–1558).|$|E
5|$|Despite failing health, Mansfield {{refused to}} officially leave his post as Lord Chief Justice because George III {{was opposed to}} the {{appointment}} of Mansfield's protégé Francis Buller to the position after Mansfield resigned. The government of the time instead suggested Lloyd Kenyon as a possible successor. Mansfield <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> office until 1788, (despite not sitting in court for two years) {{in the hope that}} the government would fall before he was forced to retire. This was not to be, and on 3 June, he wrote a letter of resignation effective the next day.|$|E
5000|$|He <b>clung</b> precariously <b>to</b> an upturned {{boat and}} {{avoiding}} being dashed against the rocks ...|$|R
60|$|At {{her voice}} Willy looked up, <b>clung</b> faster <b>to</b> his father, and whispered {{something}} unintelligible.|$|R
60|$|Poor little Di, who {{had been}} terribly frightened, <b>clung</b> closer <b>to</b> her father's arm on hearing this.|$|R
5|$|During {{the second}} half, however, {{things began to}} fall apart for Virginia Tech. Hokie quarterback Sean Glennon threw three interceptions and fumbled the ball once, giving Georgia {{excellent}} field position and many chances to score. Tech <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> a 21–13 lead {{at the end of}} the third quarter, but halfway through the fourth quarter, Georgia took a 31–21 lead over Virginia Tech. The Hokies closed the gap to 31–24 with a late field goal, but Georgia's defense held and the Bulldogs clinched the victory.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Locke, driving Rocket, now {{saw that}} there were people on the line ahead. Rocket was an {{engineering}} prototype, and had not been equipped with brakes. Locke threw the engine into reverse gear, a process which took ten seconds to engage. As Rocket continued to approach, Huskisson and Holmes panicked. Holmes <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> the side of the Duke's carriage, while Huskisson made two efforts to run across the track to safety, each time returning {{to the side of the}} carriage.|$|E
5|$|Mississippi scored another {{touchdown}} before halftime, and the Hokies <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> a 17–14 lead at {{the beginning}} of the second half. That three-point lead quickly evaporated, however, as 21seconds into the third quarter, Mississippi's Steve Hindman ran for 79yards and a touchdown to give Mississippi a 21–17 lead. Ole Miss added 13 more points before the game was over and earned the victory, 34–17. The Virginia Tech offense was stymied by repeated turnovers. Tech fumbled the ball threetimes and Tech quarterback Humphries threw twointerceptions. Tech committed 120yards in penalties and was held to just twopassing yards for the entire game.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned her}} wonder-stricken face towards him still; but drew back, and <b>clung</b> closer <b>to</b> her friend.|$|R
60|$|Idella had <b>clung</b> fast <b>to</b> Annie's hand; as Annie {{started toward}} the dining-room she got before her, and whispered vehemently.|$|R
60|$|But Spinkie did {{not seem}} to {{perceive}} the necessity, for he <b>clung</b> closer <b>to</b> his master with a remonstrative, croak.|$|R
5|$|On 23 October 1817, a British sloop, William and Mary, foundered {{after hitting}} the rock islands near Flat Holm known as The Wolves (Bristol Channel). The ship {{was en route}} from Bristol to Waterford and sank within fifteen minutes. The Mate, John Outridge, and two sailors made off in the only lifeboat. Fifteen {{survivors}} were later rescued, having <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> the ship's rigging, but fifty-four other passengers were lost. Fifty of the bodies were recovered from the ship and were buried on Flat Holm.|$|E
5|$|Social {{rigidification}} {{became a}} common feature of Soviet society. During the Stalin {{era in the}} 1930s and 1940s, a common labourer could expect promotion to a white-collar job if he studied and obeyed Soviet authorities. In Brezhnev's Soviet Union {{this was not the}} case. Holders of attractive positions <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> them as long as possible; mere incompetence was not seen as a good reason to dismiss anyone. In this way, too, the Soviet society Brezhnev passed on had become static.|$|E
5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Great Depression in the United Kingdom, the {{government}} became more parsimonious with funding for science. At the same time, Lawrence's recent invention, the cyclotron, promised to revolutionise experimental nuclear physics, and Chadwick felt that the Cavendish laboratory would fall behind unless it also acquired one. He therefore chafed under Rutherford, who <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> the belief that good nuclear physics could still be done without large, expensive equipment, and turned down the request for a cyclotron.|$|E
60|$|Annette <b>clung</b> weakly <b>to</b> the {{telephone}} box. Her mind {{was in a}} whirl, but {{she was beginning to}} see many things.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do not stop, mejuffrouw, to parley {{with any}} of these scamps," [...] said Maria as she <b>clung</b> fearsomely <b>to</b> her mistress's cloak.|$|R
60|$|Billy said nothing, but <b>clung</b> closer <b>to</b> his father, {{while his}} heart was filled with solemn, rather than fearful, {{thoughts}} of death.|$|R
5|$|During the night, {{the company}} <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> {{the edge of}} the plateau upon which the Sattelberg mission was situated, as fresh {{supplies}} were brought up from the rear. The attack was resumed at 08:35 hours the next day, supported by heavy artillery and mortar fire, however, as the 2/48th crested the ridge they found the position unoccupied, with the Japanese having abandoned it the previous night. For his actions the previous day, Derrick was given the honour of raising the Australian flag over the mission and was later awarded a Victoria Cross—the battalion's fourth—to go with the Distinguished Conduct Medal he had received for actions during the fighting around El Alamein. Later, Derrick was sent to an Officer Training Unit, after which he was commissioned and, returned to the battalion as a lieutenant; this was a departure from usual Army policy and was the result of intensive lobbying on Derrick's behalf.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the storm, about 21,800fishing boats in the Chinese province of Hainan returned to port, and about 120,000people evacuated from fish farms and low-lying areas on the island. Officials halted ferry service between Hainan and the Leizhou Peninsula in Guangdong province. Offshore, 56fishermen rode out the storm in a shelter on the Paracel Islands; 38people were rescued shortly after the storm, and initially eighteen people were reported missing. The eighteen missing fishermen were found thirty hours after Neoguri struck. The ship they were on had sunk, and the crew <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> debris and made makeshift rafts {{to survive in the}} waters. However, another 18 Chinese fisherman and 22 Vietnamese fisherman remain missing. On Hainan island, the storm left the city of Wenchang without power.|$|E
5|$|That rebellious {{attitude}} really came, I think, when {{my father}} remarried. Because for the three years before he married, I <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> him. It was like, OK, now you're mine, and you're not going anywhere. Like all young girls, I {{was in love with}} my father and I didn't want to lose him. I lost my mother, but then I was the mother, my father was mine. Then he got taken away from me when he married my stepmother. It was then that I said, OK I don’t need anybody. No one's going to break my heart again. I'm not going to need anybody. I can stand on my own and be my own person and not belong to anyone.|$|E
6000|$|Stephen <b>clung</b> close <b>to</b> Harold in a {{state of}} {{agitation}} which was almost hysterical. She buried her face in his shoulder, sobbing brokenly: ...|$|R
60|$|But Hal had <b>clung</b> fast <b>to</b> that locket {{as a sort}} of birthright, and it was at {{this moment}} safe in his {{trousers}} pocket.|$|R
60|$|Confidence and dismay {{seemed to}} {{struggle}} {{together in the}} face of the girl, but the former rose uppermost, for she <b>clung</b> fast <b>to</b> hope.|$|R
5|$|Chief Gunner's Mate Michael B. Wallrath, who had {{assisted}} in lowering three lifeboats while he remained on board, jumped overboard after seeing {{to it that}} all the boats were away. Wallrath was pulled into lifeboat number 6 just before a wave capsized it and drowned two of its occupants. Lieutenant commander R. B. Vandervoort, USNRF, West Gates commanding officer, remained on board until he felt sure that the entire crew had departed the sinking ship. When he climbed up on the deckhouse to cut free a life raft and leave the ship, he discovered six men huddled on deck. Vandervoort {{was able to get}} the six on the life raft, but the suction caused by West Gates final plunge pulled him away and below the surface. After he managed {{to get back to the}} surface, he <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> floating wreckage for two hours until pulled aboard the very raft he had missed earlier. Vandervoort and the six men aboard the raft were rescued by one of Americans lifeboats at 06:00, after some 3½ hours in the water.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s, Playford and the LCL's {{share of}} the vote {{declined}} continually despite the economic growth, and they <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> power mainly due to the Playmander. Playford became less assured in parliament as Labor became more aggressive, their leading debater Don Dunstan combatively disrupting the previously collaborative style of politics, targeting the injustice of the Playmander in particular. Playford's successful economic policies had fuelled a rapid expansion of the middle class, which wanted more government attention to education, public healthcare, the arts, the environment and heritage protection. However, Playford was an unrelenting utilitarian, and was unmoved by calls to broaden policy focus beyond economic development. This was exacerbated by Playford and his party's failure to adapt to changing social mores, remaining adamantly committed to restrictive laws on alcohol, gambling and police powers. A turning point in Playford's tenure was the Max Stuart case in the 1950s, when Playford came under heavy scrutiny for his hesitation to grant clemency to a murderer on death row amid claims of judicial wrongdoing. Although Playford eventually commuted the sentence under heavy criticism of the judicial review process, the controversy was seen as responsible for his government losing its assurance, and he eventually lost office in the 1965 election. He relinquished the party leadership to Steele Hall and retired at the next election, serving on various South Australian company boards {{until his death in}} 1981.|$|E
5|$|Following the annulment, Cromwell was {{executed}} on 28 July. Cranmer now {{found himself in}} a politically prominent position, with no-one else to shoulder the burden. Throughout the rest of Henry's reign, he <b>clung</b> <b>to</b> Henry's authority. The king had total trust in him and in return, Cranmer could not conceal anything from the king. At the end of June 1541, Henry with his new wife, Catherine Howard, left for his first visit to the north of England. Cranmer was left in London {{as a member of a}} council taking care of matters for the king in his absence. His colleagues were Lord Chancellor Thomas Audley and Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford. This was Cranmer's first major piece of responsibility outside the Church. In October, while the king and queen were away, a reformer named John Lascelles revealed to Cranmer that Catherine engaged in extramarital affairs. Cranmer gave the information to Audley and Seymour and they decided to wait until Henry's return. Afraid of angering the king, Audley and Seymour suggested that Cranmer inform Henry. Cranmer slipped a message to Henry during mass on All Saints Day. An investigation revealed the truth of the marital indiscretions and Catherine {{was executed}} in February 1542.|$|E
60|$|Maria {{was already}} {{dissolved}} in tears. Mrs. Posttlethwaite was struck dumb by the awfulness of the occasion, and <b>clung</b> fast <b>to</b> her sister Matilda.|$|R
60|$|At first their {{fall was}} swift as an arrow, but {{presently}} {{they seemed to}} be going more moderately and Trot was almost sure that unseen arms were about her, supporting her and protecting her. She could see nothing, because the water filled her eyes and blurred her vision, but she <b>clung</b> fast <b>to</b> Cap'n Bill's sou'wester, while other arms <b>clung</b> fast <b>to</b> her, and so they gradually sank down and down until a full stop was made, when they began to ascend again.|$|R
6000|$|... "How should I know?" [...] she {{answered}} with a shrug. [...] "Beatrice saved his life somehow, <b>clung</b> fast <b>to</b> him even after she was insensible." ...|$|R
