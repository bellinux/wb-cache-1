40|$|The {{consequences}} for direct {{reactions of the}} dynamical non-locality generated by the excitation of the target and projectile are much less studied than the effects of non-locality arising from exchange processes. Here we {{are concerned with the}} dynamical non-locality due to projectile excitation in deuteron induced reactions. The consequences of this non-locality can be studied by the comparison of deuteron induced direct reactions calculated with alternative representations of the elastic <b>channel</b> <b>wave</b> functions: (i) the elastic <b>channel</b> <b>wave</b> functions from coupled channel (CC) calculations involving specific reaction processes, and, (ii) elastic <b>channel</b> <b>wave</b> functions calculated from local potentials that exactly reproduce the elastic scattering $S$-matrix from the same CC calculations. In this work we produce the local equivalent deuteron potentials required for the study of direct reactions involving deuterons. These will enable the study of the effects of dynamical non-locality following a method previously employed in an investigation of the effects of non-locality due to target excitation. In this work we consider only excitations due to deuteron breakup, and some new properties of the breakup dynamical polarization potential (DPP) emerge that reveal dynamical non-locality directly. In addition, we evaluate the TELP inversion method and find that it fails to reproduce some features of the DPP due to breakup. Comment: 29 pages, 8 figure...|$|E

40|$|The {{scattering}} of a weakly bound (halo) projectile nucleus by a {{heavy target nucleus}} is investigated. A new approach, called the Uncorrelated Scattering Approximation, is proposed. The main approximation involved is to neglect {{the correlation between the}} fragments of the projectile in the region where the interaction with the target is important. The formalism makes use of hyper-spherical harmonics, Raynal-Revay coefficients and momentum-localized wave functions to expand projectile <b>channel</b> <b>wave</b> functions in terms of products of the <b>channel</b> <b>wave</b> function of the individual fragments. Within this approach, the kinetic energy and angular momentum of each fragment is conserved during the scattering process.

40|$|The {{adiabatic}} hyperspherical {{technique is}} applied to investigate the asymptotic behavior of three-body systems. Here our {{attention is focused on}} deriving the analytical expressions for the asymptotic effective potential curves and the corresponding <b>channel</b> <b>wave</b> functions of the system, which, so far, cannot be obtained otherwise by conventional numerical methods to the required accuracy. ^ Firstly, we consider a system of three charged particles of which two have opposite charges. We study such asymptotic regions in which one particle is far away from the other two, leaving them in either the ground state or, more importantly, excited ones. Asymptotic adiabatic hyperspherical potential curves and <b>channel</b> <b>wave</b> functions, valid through 1 /R 4 and 1 /R 2 respectively, are obtained. The wave functions and potentials include the polarization potential characteristic of the polarized orbital approximation. Terms specific to the separation in hyperspherical coordinates are identified. This investigation is then extended to three-body systems such as Helium and other iso-electronic ions in which two of the particles are identical. A symmetrization treatment of such systems leads us to a reasonable approximation to their asymptotic potential curves. ^ Secondly, we study three neutral bosons with two-body short range interactions characterized by the so-called effective range r o and scattering length c o. Analytical expressions for the effective hyper-radial potential are also obtained without explicit use of the two-body potential. The analytical results are then used to compare the general asymptotic behaviors of three-body systems interacting via short range potentials with those interacting via long range Coulomb ones. Possible loosely bound states of the system have also been analyzed quantitatively and the result confirms the prediction by Efimov. At the same time, some new characteristics of the three-body system are discussed. This investigation, once again, demonstrates the adiabatic hyperspherical method as a comprehensive framework for quantitative treatment of three-body systems. ...|$|E
