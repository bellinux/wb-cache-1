5|$|The {{conquest of}} the Danelaw by West Saxon kings had united England in a single kingdom for the first time, {{enabling}} kings from Æthelstan onwards {{to see themselves as}} heirs of the Carolingian emperors; the regulation of monasteries by a uniform Benedictine rule was designed to unite the kingdom ideologically and enhance royal prestige. The monks depended on the king {{in a way that the}} local ealdormen did not, so their loyalty <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>trusted</b> and they could act as a counterbalance to powerful local families. The Regularis Concordia required that psalms be said for the king and the queen in monasteries several times a day, and specified that royal consent must be obtained for the election of abbots. The reformers aimed to enhance the Christian character of kingship, and one aspect of this was to raise the status of the queen; Edgar's last wife, Ælfthryth, was the first king's consort to regularly witness charters as regina.|$|E

Say to one of these gentlemen, by way of experiment, if you please, that you believe occasions may occur where x squared + px is not altogether equal to q, and, having made him understand what you mean, get out of his reach as speedily as convenient, for, beyond doubt, he will endeavor to knock you down.|$|E

50|$|The Constitutional Court held Dlamini {{primarily}} responsible for the crisis, with Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng saying there was no explanation for the incompetence displayed by her and SASSA. According to constitutional scholar Pierre de Vos, the Constitutional Court had concluded that SASSA and Dlamini <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> <b>trusted</b> to do their constitutionally mandated job to ensure delivery of social grants, and <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> <b>trusted</b> not to lie to the courts in the future.|$|R

25|$|Richard {{served as}} a member of the Virginia House of Delegates from 1784 to 1788, 1796, and again from 1799 to 1806. During his second term in the state {{legislature}} he was involved in debates surrounding the ratification of the United States Constitution which he wholeheartedly supported. Following ratification he opposed efforts by Patrick Henry and others to call a second constitutional convention to add a bill of rights, believing the new system should be given a chance to operate before wholesale alterations were made. He also believed that the new congress <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>trusted</b> to add the necessary amendments.|$|E
25|$|Armies {{during the}} Revolution became noticeably larger than their Holy Roman counterparts, and {{combined}} with the new enthusiasm of the troops, the tactical and strategic opportunities became profound. By 1797 the French had defeated the First Coalition, occupied the Low Countries, {{the west bank of}} the Rhine, and Northern Italy, objectives which had defied the Valois and Bourbon dynasties for centuries. Unsatisfied with the results, many European powers formed a Second Coalition, but by 1801 this too had been decisively beaten. Another key aspect of French success was the changes wrought in the officer classes. Traditionally, European armies left major command positions to those who <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>trusted,</b> namely, the aristocracy. The hectic nature of the French Revolution, however, tore apart France's old army, meaning new men were required to become officers and commanders.|$|E
25|$|Once a case came to court, {{the method}} used {{to come to a}} {{decision}} was usually by compurgation. Under this system the person accused or the parties to a dispute would give their version under oath, following which they had to find a number of others who would take an oath that the principal's oath <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>trusted.</b> The number of compurgators required depended {{on the nature of the}} case. The judge or judges would then come to a decision. Capital punishment was only prescribed for a small number of crimes. Homicide was usually dealt with by the payment of compensation to the victim's family, while theft could be punished by death only if it was theft by stealth and the thief was caught with the goods in hand; the value of the goods stolen also had to exceed four pence. Most other offences were punished by a fine.|$|E

25|$|In July 1894, Holmes {{was arrested}} and briefly incarcerated for the first time, on the charge of selling mortgaged goods in St. Louis, Missouri. He was {{promptly}} bailed out, but while in jail he {{struck up a conversation}} with a convicted outlaw named Marion Hedgepeth, who was serving a 25-year sentence. Holmes had concocted a plan to swindle an insurance company out of $10,000 by taking out a policy on himself and then faking his death. Holmes promised Hedgepeth a $500 commission in exchange for the name of a lawyer who <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>trusted.</b> Holmes was directed to a young St. Louis attorney named Jeptha Howe. Howe was in practice with his older brother, Alphonso Howe, who had no involvement with Holmes or Pitezel or their fraudulent activities. Jeptha Howe, however, found Holmes' scheme brilliant. Nevertheless, Holmes' plan to fake his own death failed when the insurance company became suspicious and refused to pay. Holmes did not press the claim; instead, he concocted a similar plan with Pitezel.|$|E

[...] At this member's request, the ayuntamiento of San Antonio de Béxar forwarded the letter to state officials in Coahuila. [...] The new governor, Francisco Vidaurri y Villaseñor, ordered Austin's arrest. Austin was arrested in December on suspicion of treason.

It was enough that they knew it existed to keep the rental money, legal fees and other gratuities flowing from their families, fees that {{anywhere}} else would have seen them living in the lap of luxury, but which in the Marshalsea <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>trusted</b> merely to stave off disease and starvation.|$|E

Langlais ordered another counterattack the following afternoon against [...] "Dominique 2" [...] and [...] "Eliane 1", using virtually [...] "everybody {{left in the}} garrison who <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>trusted</b> to fight". The counterattacks allowed the French to retake [...] "Dominique 2" [...] and Eliane 1, but the Viet Minh launched their own renewed assault. The French, who were exhausted and without reserves, fell back from both positions late in the afternoon. Reinforcements were sent north from [...] "Isabelle", but were attacked en route and fell back to [...] "Isabelle".|$|E
500|$|When John Stroger, who {{was first}} elected to the Cook County Board of Commissioners in 1970 and who served three terms as President {{beginning}} in 1994, suffered a stroke on March 14, 2006, Daley was mentioned as a likely fill-in who <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>trusted</b> until Stroger's son, Todd Stroger, could run to replace his father as President and William Beavers could run for his seat in the November 2006 elections.

500|$|After all, {{the carpet}} {{was only one}} of a number of disputed items, and the real issue lay not in the mere money value of these things, but in whether Carte <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>trusted</b> with the {{financial}} affairs of Gilbert and Sullivan. Gilbert contended that Carte had at best made a series of serious blunders in the accounts, and at worst deliberately attempted to swindle the others. It is not easy to settle the rights and wrongs of the issue at this distance, but it does seem fairly clear that there was something very wrong with the accounts at this time. Gilbert wrote to Sullivan on 28 May 1891, a year after the end of the [...] "Quarrel", that Carte had admitted [...] "an unintentional overcharge of nearly £1,000 in the electric lighting accounts alone." ...|$|E

500|$|In June 1812, he was {{appointed}} Solicitor General for England and Wales, receiving the customary knighthood, and, in May 1813, he {{was appointed}} Attorney General. The Attorney General was the senior Crown prosecutor, {{during a time when}} the Prince Regent feared liberal changes to the criminal law and Parliamentary structure. Garrow, as [...] "a mere creature of the Regent", <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>trusted</b> to oppose this; rather than the progressive, defensive work undertaken in his early career, this period was one of conservative aggression against the reformers. Garrow ran particularly foul of Sir Samuel Romilly, who was one of those looking to reform a penal code many claimed was not working. On 5 April 1813, Romilly's Bill on Attainder of Treason and Felony came before Parliament. Its intent was to remove corruption of the blood from cases involving treason and felony; Garrow, then Solicitor General, declared that the Bill would remove one of the safeguards of the British Constitution. The Bill eventually failed, and corruption of the blood was not removed from English law until the Forfeiture Act 1870.|$|E
500|$|With {{an eye to}} {{a presidential}} bid in 1860, Seward tried to appear a statesman who <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>trusted</b> by both North and South. Seward {{did not believe the}} federal {{government}} could mandate emancipation but that it would develop by action of the slave states as the nation urbanized and slavery became uneconomical, as it had in New York. Southerners still believed that he was threatening the forced end of slavery. While campaigning for Republicans in the 1858 midterm elections, Seward gave a speech at Rochester that proved divisive and quotable, alleging that the U.S. had two [...] "antagonistic system [...] are continually coming into closer contact, and collision results.… It is an irrepressible conflict between opposing and enduring forces, and it means that the United States must and will, sooner or later, become entirely either a slave-holding nation, or entirely a free-labor nation." [...] White southerners saw the [...] "irrepressible conflict" [...] speech as a declaration of war, and Seward's vehemence ultimately damaged his chances of gaining the presidential nomination.|$|E
500|$|Other known works {{exist in}} {{fragments}} alone, including the four eschatological {{works in the}} secret tradition: Hypotyposes, Excerpta ex Theodoto, Eclogae Propheticae and the Adumbraetiones. These cover Clement's celestial hierarchy, a complex schema in which the universe is headed by the Face of God, below which lie seven protoctists, followed by archangels, angels and humans. According to Jean Daniélou, this schema is inherited from a Judaeo-Christian esotericism, followed by the Apostles, which was only imparted orally to those Christians who <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>trusted</b> with such mysteries. The proctocists are the first beings created by God, and act as priests to the archangels. Clement identifies them both as the [...] "Eyes of the Lord" [...] and with the Thrones. Clement characterizes the celestial forms as entirely different from anything earthly, although he argues that members of each order only seem incorporeal to those of lower orders. According to the Eclogae Propheticae, every thousand years every member of each order moves up a degree, and thus men can become angels. Even the protoctists can be elevated, although their new position in the hierarchy is not clearly defined. The apparent contradiction between {{the fact that there}} can be only seven protoctists but also a vast number of archangels to be promoted to their order is problematical. The commonest modern explanation is that the number seven is not meant to be taken literally, but has a principally numerological significance.|$|E
