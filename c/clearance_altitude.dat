50|$|For example, see the {{illustration}} above. In this case, {{a segment of}} an airway ending at fix ABC has a MEA of 5200 feet MSL, and the minimum obstacle <b>clearance</b> <b>altitude</b> (MOCA) required to clear an obstacle six nautical miles from the fix within the next segment is 6620 feet MSL. The total increase in altitude from 5200 feet to 6620 feet over that distance is 1420 feet. At a normal rate of climb (120 feet per nautical mile at this altitude), the maximum altitude that can be gained over that distance is 720 feet, which is 700 feet below the required MOCA. Thus, a MCA for fix ABC of 5900 feet MSL (700 feet above the MEA of the previous segment) will be published for fix ABC for traffic continuing into the airway segment concerned from that fix.|$|E
50|$|Minimum Obstruction <b>Clearance</b> <b>Altitude,</b> or MOCA, is {{the lowest}} {{published}} altitude in effect between fixes on VOR airways or route segments that meets obstacle (like a building or a tower) clearance requirements for the entire route segment. Within the United States, this altitude also assures acceptable navigational signal coverage only within 22 nm of a VOR. The MOCA seen on the NACO en route chart, may have been computed by adding the required obstacle clearance (ROC) to the controlling obstacle in the primary area or computed by using a TERPS chart if the controlling obstacle {{is located in the}} secondary area. This figure is then rounded to the nearest 100 foot increment, i.e. 2,049 feet becomes 2,000, and 2,050 feet becomes 2,100 feet. An extra 2,000 feet is added in mountainous areas, 1,000 in non-mountainous. The MOCA is based upon obstacle clearance over the terrain or over manmade objects, adequacy of navigation facility performance, and communications requirements. The MOCA is always at or below the Minimum en route altitude (MEA), and may put an aircraft below air traffic control radar coverage and also below Minimum reception altitude (MRA) for navigation aids; as a result, it is typically used only in emergencies, especially to get below icing.|$|E
40|$|NASA and the U. S. Army have designed, developed, {{and flight}} {{evaluated}} a Computer Aiding for Low Altitude Helicopter Flight (CALAHF) guidance system. This system {{provides guidance to}} the pilot for near terrain covert helicopter operations.

The symbology is a 'pilot-centered' design which preserves pilot flexibility and authority over the CALAHF system's automation. An extensive flight evaluation of the system has been conducted using the U. S. Army's NUH- 60 STAR (Systems Testbed for Avionics Research) research helicopter.

40|$|Task-analytic models {{structure}} {{essential information}} about operator interaction with complex systems, {{in this case}} pilot interaction with the autoflight system. Such models serve two purposes: (1) they allow researchers and practitioners to understand pilots' actions; and (2) they provide a compact, computational representation needed to design 'intelligent' aids, e. g., displays, assistants, and training systems. This paper demonstrates {{the use of the}} operator function model to trace the process of mode engagements while a pilot is controlling an aircraft via the, autoflight system. The operator function model is a normative and nondeterministic model of how a well-trained, well-motivated operator manages multiple concurrent activities for effective real-time control. For each function, the model links the pilot's actions with the required information. Using the operator function model, this paper describes several mode engagement scenarios. These scenarios were observed and documented during a field study that focused on mode engagements and mode transitions during normal line operations. Data including time, ATC <b>clearances,</b> <b>altitude,</b> system states, and active modes and sub-modes, engagement of modes, were recorded during sixty-six flights. Using these data, seven prototypical mode engagement scenarios were extracted. One scenario details the decision of the crew to disengage a fully automatic mode in favor of a semi-automatic mode, and the consequences of this action. Another describes a mode error involving updating aircraft speed following the engagement of a speed submode. Other scenarios detail mode confusion at various phases of the flight. This analysis uses the operator function model to identify three aspects of mode engagement: (1) the progress of pilot-aircraft-autoflight system interaction; (2) control/display information required to perform mode management activities; and (3) the potential cause(s) of mode confusion. The goal of this paper is twofold: (1) to demonstrate the use of the operator functio model methodology to describe pilot-system interaction while engaging modes And monitoring the system, and (2) to initiate a discussion of how task-analytic models might inform design processes. While the operator function model is only one type of task-analytic representation, the hypothesis of this paper is that some type of task analytic structure is a prerequisite for the design of effective human-automation interaction...|$|R

40|$|A {{conflict}} detection and resolution tool, Terminal Tactical Separation Assurance Flight Environment (T-TSAFE), {{is being developed}} to improve the accuracy and reduce the false alert rate beyond currently deployed technology. The legacy system in use today, Conflict Alert, relies primarily on a dead reckoning algorithm. By adding altitude intent information for {{conflict detection}} and resolution, T-TSAFE may improve conflict detection accuracy. In addition to verifying T-TSAFE’s efficacy over Conflict Alert, an initial human-in-the-loop study suggested possible avenues of tool improvement through heuristic analysis. Results of this analysis were then used to guide a follow-up T-TSAFE investigation, which is described in this paper. This follow-up study tested four experimental conditions. The first two conditions varied conflict detection with and without <b>altitude</b> <b>clearances</b> entered into the tool by the controllers via keyboard. The other two conditions varied the presence of Automatic Terminal Proximity Alert (ATPA), an FAA tool used for monitoring final approach [1]. One of these final approach conditions used regular alerts in the data block without cones and the others used ATPA cones between different aircraft (i. e., a cone graphic shown in the flight display) as a warning for possible compression errors in the final approach. Entering <b>altitude</b> <b>clearances</b> into T-TSAFE was expected to reduce false alerts but did not, possibly due to the short duration of the runs, which did not allow for a large enough frequency of altitude entries to study the issue adequately. Also, the test conditions did not significantly impact {{the duration of the}} alert or the controller’s response time to the alert. The subjective data showed that controllers favored the ATPA cones over the T-TSAFE alerts in the data blocks on final approach.

40|$|Algorithms {{for resolving}} air traffic {{conflicts}} are tested on archived tracking data from 102 actual operational errors (violations of minimum required separation due to controller error).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a conflict resolution algorithm {{that can provide}} automated separation assurance {{for the next generation}} air traffic control system. The algorithm generates resolution trajectories that can be sent to the aircraft from a ground-based system via data link. The algorithm can also be installed on board aircraft. It handles the complete spectrum of conflict types encountered in en route airspace, including ascents and descents to arrival fixes. The resolution trajectories consist of amendments and changes to flight plans (route changes), <b>altitude</b> <b>clearances,</b> and descent speed profiles. The trajectories are similar to those that controllers customarily issue to pilots in resolving conflicts. The algorithm generates 4 D resolution trajectories by evaluating successive alternative trial resolution maneuvers. Each conflict type determines a set of acceptable trial resolution maneuvers and what the preferred aircraft is to perform the maneuver. A trajectory engine generates a 4 D trajectory for each trial maneuver, and an associated conflict detector checks it to ensure it is conflict free. If it is not, the algorithm selects an alternative maneuver. This iterative process continues until a successful resolution is found. The resolution algorithm has been implemented and evaluated in a non-real time simulation, and its performance in resolving conflicts for a range of traffic levels is presented in this paper. Results indicate that the algorithm has the potential to resolve conflicts efficiently at significantly higher than current traffic levels. ...|$|R

40|$|Air traffic {{systems have}} long relied on {{automated}} short-term conflict prediction algorithms to warn controllers of impending conflicts (losses of separation). The complexity of terminal airspace has proven difficult for such systems as it {{often leads to}} excessive false alerts. Thus, the legacy system, called Conflict Alert, which provides short-term alerts in both en-route and terminal airspace currently, is often inhibited or degraded in areas where frequent false alerts occur, even though the alerts are provided only when an aircraft is in dangerous proximity of other aircraft. This research investigates how a minimal level of flight intent information {{may be used to}} improve short-term conflict detection in terminal airspace such that it can be used by the controller to maintain legal aircraft separation. The flight intent information includes a site-specific nominal arrival route and inferred <b>altitude</b> <b>clearances</b> in addition to the flight plan that includes the RNAV (Area Navigation) departure route. A new tactical conflict detection algorithm is proposed, which uses a single analytic trajectory, determined by the flight intent and the current state information of the aircraft, and includes a complex set of current, dynamic separation standards for terminal airspace to define losses of separation. The new algorithm is compared with an algorithm that imitates a known en-route algorithm and another that imitates Conflict Alert by analysis of false-alert rate and alert lead time with recent real-world data of arrival and departure operations and a large set of operational error cases from Dallas/Fort Worth TRACON (Terminal Radar Approach Control).

Furthermore, there were 46 controlled satellites and 170 uncontrolled objects with no TLE information at all. Thus, the total number of known objects in the geostationary region was 1186, out of which 381 were controlled, 800 were uncontrolled and 5 could not be classified. During the year 2008, 12 GEO spacecraft reached their end of life. Seven of them were re-orbited following the IADC guidelines, two were re-orbited with an insufficient GEO clearance and three spacecraft were abandoned without any re-orbiting manoeuvre. The re-orbiting statistics of the years from 1997 to 2008 show that the adherence to the IADC space debris mitigation guidelines is slowly improving over time. Also the re-orbiting practice of GPS satellites is analysed. For 22 of the 56 launched GPS satellites a disposal manoeuvre was identified from the DISCOS TLE data. Since the year 2000, the orbits of the GPS satellites are usually raised by about 1000 km at end-of-life. Finally the re-orbiting options of Galileo satellites are compared. An alternative to the currently proposed orbit raising after end-of-life is the re-orbiting into a lower orbit with the highest achievable eccentricity. It will take more than 100 years until a satellite will finally decay. But the average risk that the satellite will encounter a collision during its long journey towards its final decay is about 10 - 7 which can be considered low enough to make it an attractive re-orbiting alternative...|$|R
