In 2013 JSC “NIIEFA” delivered 95 high <b>voltage</b> <b>insulation</b> breaks to the IO ITER, i. e. 65 breaks with spiral channels and 30 breaks with uniflow channels. These high <b>voltage</b> <b>insulation</b> breaks were designed, manufactured and tested {{in accordance with the}} ITER Technical Specifications: «Axial Insulating Breaks for the Qualification Phase of ITER Coils and Feeders». The high <b>voltage</b> <b>insulation</b> breaks consist of the glass-reinforced plastic cylinder equipped with channels for cryoagent and stainless steel end fittings. The operating voltage is 30 kV for the breaks with spiral channels (30 kV HV IBs) and 4 kV for the breaks with uniflow channels (4  kV HV IBs). The main design feature of the 30  kV HV IBs is the spiral channels instead of a linear one. This approach has enabled us to increase the breakdown voltage and decrease the overall dimensions of the high <b>voltage</b> <b>insulation</b> breaks. In 2013 the manufacturing technique was developed to produce the high <b>voltage</b> <b>insulation</b> breaks with the spiral and uniflow channels that made it possible to proceed to serial production. To provide the acceptance tests of the breaks a special test facility was prepared.

This electrical insulation is achieved with {{a printed circuit}} board (PCB) and classical copper windings.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} used cable-in-conduit {{conductor}} (CICC) coils {{in trying to}} develop an AC superconducting magnet because of its enormous potential if AC losses were low and <b>insulation</b> <b>voltage</b> was high. The strands {{in the most recent}} CICC magnets are coated with chromium or another metal with high electrical resistance to order to induce current re-distribution among the strands and to avoid a quench caused by a current imbalance. Current re-distribution is highly complex and very difficult to analyze because the conditions of the strand surfaces and the contact areas vary greatly with the operation of the conductor. If, however, the cable currents were well-balanced, insulating the strands would {{be the best way to}} reduce AC losses. We propose a new CICC magnet structure featuring a current lead that balances the strand currents via its resistance. Having calculated current balances, we find that strand currents are well within the present parameters for nuclear fusion experiments and superconducting magnet energy storages. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- As {{the power}} density {{requirement}} for new compul-sator (CPA) designs increases, designers are driven {{to use more}} composites to reduce mass, spin the rotors faster to store more energy, and operate the machine at higher voltages to increase machine power output. In any particular compulsator design, the rotor windings are subjected to high strain levels as the rotor is spun and experiences radial growth. A critical component in the rotor winding design is the high <b>voltage</b> <b>insulation.</b> As the rotor is spun, the induced strains are applied to the insulation system on the coil conductors.
