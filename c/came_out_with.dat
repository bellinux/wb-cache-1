5|$|On August 23, the modest-sized Austrian film {{industry}} <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> a talkie: G'schichten aus der Steiermark (Stories from Styria), an Eagle Film–Ottoton Film production. On September 30, the first entirely German-made feature-length dramatic talkie, Das Land ohne Frauen (Land Without Women), premiered. A Tobis Filmkunst production, {{about one-quarter of}} the movie contained dialogue, which was strictly segregated from the special effects and music. The response was underwhelming. Sweden's first talkie, Konstgjorda Svensson (Artificial Svensson), premiered on October 14. Eight days later, Aubert Franco-Film <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> Le Collier de la reine (The Queen's Necklace), shot at the Épinay studio near Paris. Conceived as a silent film, it was given a Tobis-recorded score and a single talking sequence—the first dialogue scene in a French feature. On October 31, Les Trois masques debuted; a Pathé-Natan film, it is generally regarded as the initial French feature talkie, though it was shot, like Blackmail, at the Elstree studio, just outside London. The production company had contracted with RCA Photophone and Britain then had the nearest facility with the system. The Braunberger-Richebé talkie La Route est belle, also shot at Elstree, followed a few weeks later.|$|E

5|$|During Harper's tenure, Canada had {{budgetary}} surpluses from 2006 to 2008 of $13.8 and 9.6 billion respectively. Following the 2008 financial crisis, Canada ran deficits from 2009-2013. The {{deficit was}} $55.6 billion in 2009 and was gradually lowered to $5.2 billion in 2013. In 2014, {{the federal budget}} was balanced with a surplus of $1.9 billion. For the first 11 months of 2015, {{the federal government was}} on track for a $7.5 billion surplus. Following the 2015 federal election and a change in government, the 2015 fiscal year ended in a $1 billion deficit instead. In 2010, Canada had the lowest debt-to-GDP ratio in the G7 economies. The Economist magazine stated that Canada had come out the recession stronger than any other rich country in the G7. In 2013, Canada <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> Global Markets Action Plan to generate employment opportunities for Canadians.|$|E

I don't have many friends in my personal life, but I have so many fans. So when I go outside and people recognize me, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, like I don't recognize the fans. I don't really have it like they probably think I have it. I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now. I don't have a girlfriend no more, and I have this money, but I'm not satisfied with my life. It's this weird feeling of being incomplete, and I need to find myself.

Then, an emissary <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> a white flag to negotiate {{the terms of the}} fort’s surrender. General Maison replied that the terms had been negotiated {{at the beginning of the}} month at Patras. He added that he did not trust a group of besieged men who had not respected a first agreement to respect a second one. He gave the garrison half an hour to evacuate the fort, without arms or baggage. The aghas submitted. However, the fortress’ resistance had cost 25 men, killed or wounded in the French expedition.|$|E
5|$|That year, the Red Sox won an eventful season {{series against}} the Yankees. A 13-inning {{comeback}} win for the Yankees on July 1 was punctuated by a catch from Derek Jeter, who ran and dove into the stands at full speed and <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> facial lacerations when Trot Nixon hit a pop up in an area deep behind third base. On July 24, Jason Varitek shoved his glove {{into the face of}} the Yankees' Álex Rodríguez after Rodríguez was hit by a pitch from Bronson Arroyo, causing a bench-clearing brawl. Though he was ejected (along with Rodríguez) from the game following the incident, the moment sparked Boston to an 11–10 come-from-behind victory. Both Rodríguez and Varitek were each suspended four games and fined $2,000 for the brawl.|$|E
5|$|The morning draw {{consisted}} of mixed doubles play, where Team North America dominated Team World and earned the first sweep of three {{points in the}} event.

Glenn Howard and Natalie Nicholson held an early lead over Greg Drummond and Anna Sloan after a four-point second end, but Drummond and Sloan came back to make it a close game. In the end, Howard and Nicholson scored two to win the game. Brent Laing and Jennifer Jones played a back-and-forth game with Torger Nergård and Carmen Küng, but retained control through most of the game and <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> the victory after Küng's last shot left Team North America having shot stone, effectively giving Laing and Jones the win.|$|E

5|$|Bogdan-Pitești was by then an {{inspiration}} for the blooming Romanian Symbolist movement. In effect, {{he was the first}} Romanian expert on the work of Symbolist celebrities like Odilon Redon, Gustave Moreau, and (his favorite) Alexandre Séon. He soon became a contributor to Literatorul, a Symbolist magazine, and was close friends with its founder, Alexandru Macedonski. In 1897, he was chosen by the latter to edit and promote his book of French-language poems, Bronzes. In the end, Bogdan-Pitești provided the funds needed for Bronzes to be published in Paris. It <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> an introductory note, in which Bogdan-Pitești favorably compared Macedonski with arch-rival Mihai Eminescu. In more general terms, the preface showed Bogdan-Pitești as an unyielding Francophile, who reported with alarm that Romania risked being seduced and then engulfed by German culture. Himself a disciple of Macedonski, T. Vianu comments that Bogdan-Pitești was probably unsuited for the task of introducing Bronzes, and that, despite expectations, the volume failed to impress the French public. He notes the virtually complete lack of press reviews—with the notable exception of a May 1898 article in Mercure de France, written by the Symbolist-anarchist Pierre Quillard.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of 1896, Edison had {{turned his attention to}} promoting a projector technology, the Phantoscope, developed by young inventors Charles Francis Jenkins and Thomas Armat. The rights to the system had been acquired by Raff and Gammon, who redubbed it the Vitascope and arranged with Edison to present himself as its creator. With Dickson having left his employ, the Kinetophone was soon mothballed and Edison suspended work on sound cinema for an extended period. Departing the Vitascope operation after little more than a year, Edison commissioned the development of his own projection systems, the Projectoscope and then multiple iterations of the Projecting Kinetoscope. In 1912, he introduced the ambitious and expensive Home Projecting Kinetoscope, which employed a unique format of three parallel columns of sequential frames on one strip of film—the middle column ran through the machine in the reverse direction from its neighbors. It was a commercial failure. Four years later, the Edison operation <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> its last substantial new film exhibition technology, a short-lived theatrical system called the Super Kinetoscope. Much of the Edison company's most creative work in the motion picture field from 1897 on involved the use of Kinetoscope-related patents in threatened or actual lawsuits for the purpose of financially pressuring or blocking commercial rivals.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} the {{propulsion}} plant, {{which was to be}} built in the Netherlands, was taking shape. Requirements sent out in August 1939 mandated that the ships have eight boiler rooms, four sets of geared turbines, and 180,000shp. After further improvements, Nevesbu and two German firms (Germaniawerft was responsible for the turbines and Deschimag for the boilers) began sketching preliminary plans. These were then incorporated into two different design studies, one by Nevesbu and the other by NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw (IvS). IvS was purportedly a Dutch company linking Dutch and German designers, but in reality functioned as a front company for German interests. Their design was probably based upon a set of plans drawn up by the Ship Construction Office of the German Navy and received in the Netherlands on 31 August. It did not give the propulsion machinery enough space, and it was thought that this design did not provide enough room for magazines. Nevertheless, it was taken into discussions with the Dutch, where the 11 July design was merged with it. IvS <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> one further plan on 11 March 1940, the merits of which were discussed with the Dutch in April of that year.|$|E

5|$|In 1930, {{the first}} Polish talkies premiered, using sound-on-disc systems: Moralność pani Dulskiej (The Morality of Mrs. Dulska) in March and the all-talking Niebezpieczny romans (Dangerous Love Affair) in October. In Italy, whose once vibrant film {{industry}} had become moribund {{by the late}} 1920s, the first talkie, La Canzone dell'amore (The Song of Love), also came out in October; within two years, Italian cinema would be enjoying a revival. The first movie spoken in Czech debuted in 1930 as well, Tonka Šibenice (Tonka of the Gallows). Several European nations with minor positions in the field also produced their first talking pictures—Belgium (in French), Denmark, Greece, and Romania. The Soviet Union's robust film industry <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> its first sound features in December 1930: Dziga Vertov's nonfiction Entuziazm had an experimental, dialogueless soundtrack; Abram Room's documentary Plan velikikh rabot (The Plan of the Great Works) had music and spoken voiceovers. Both were made with locally developed sound-on-film systems, two of the two hundred or so movie sound systems then available somewhere in the world. In June 1931, the Nikolai Ekk drama Putevka v zhizn (The Road to Life or A Start in Life), premiered as the Soviet Union's first true talking picture.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opinion}} of the Moscow Helsinki Group {{chairwoman}} Lyudmila Alexeyeva, the attribution of a mental illness to a prominent figure who <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> a political declaration or action is the most significant factor in the assessment of psychiatry during the 1960–1980s. The practice of forced confinement of political dissidents in psychiatric facilities in the former USSR and Eastern Europe destroyed the credibility of psychiatric practice in these countries. When psychiatric profession is discredited {{in one part of the}} world, psychiatry is discredited throughout the world. Psychiatry lost its professional basis entirely with its abuse to stifle dissidence in the former USSR and in the so-called euthanasia program in Nazi Germany. There is little doubt that the capacity for using psychiatry to enforce social norms and even political interests is immense. Now psychiatry is vulnerable because many of its notions have been questioned, and the sustainable pattern of mental life, of boundaries of mental norm and abnormality has been lost, director of the Moscow Research Institute for Psychiatry Valery Krasnov says, adding that psychiatrists have to seek new reference points to make clinical assessments and new reference points to justify old therapeutical interventions.|$|E
5|$|It was lauded {{as one of}} the {{greatest}} matches ever by former players, legends, and analysts of the sport. John McEnroe claimed it surpassed the 2008 Wimbledon final as the best tennis match of all time, while legends Pete Sampras, Mats Wilander, and Björn Borg said it was the best match they saw in their lifetime. After the 2012 Australian Open, Rod Laver <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> his greatest in the amateur and Open Era lists, Djokovic was ranked 6th and Nadal 5th on the Open Era list.

Djokovic said it was the finest win in his career and also commented on the high level of tennis played. Not only was this the longest Grand Slam tournament final, but according to Tennis Channel and the Australian Open TV networks, this w{{as one of the}} most-watched finals, despite ending late into the night locally. Soon after the conclusion of the 2012 Australian Open, there were sources claiming that Djokovic sealed his spot as a tennis great and in the Tennis Hall of Fame.|$|E

5|$|The {{contributors}} to Seara and Libertatea were, in general, outspoken {{social and cultural}} critics, with diverse grievances against the establishment. Historian Lucian Boia argues that, even though Bogdan-Pitești was on the German payroll, his switch from the Francophiles {{could have been a}} genuine form of conservatism. Boia thus notes that Seara was supportive of the Central Powers from the 1914 build-up to the war, that is even before Cantacuzino had come to decide which side he liked best. The core group of Seara men included socialists of various hues: Arghezi, who claimed that Serbian nationalism was the spark of the war; Felix Aderca, who depicted the German Empire as the more progressive belligerent; and Rodion, who rendered the complains of Germanophile intellectuals from Moldavia. Others were left-wing refugees from the Russian Empire, who wanted Romania to join the Central Powers and help liberate Bessarabia: Alexis Nour, from the Poporanist faction, and the old anarchist Zamfir Arbore. Seara was also a platform for some disgruntled Romanians from Transylvania region, a Romanian irredenta under Austro-Hungarian rule. They included a mainstream Conservative commentator, Ilie Bărbulescu, who advised Romanians to not to focus on Transylvania, and prioritized action against the Russians. Two distinct voices were those of poet Dumitru Karnabatt, who identified the Entente Powers with Pan-Slavism or British imperialism; and Ion Gorun, the Transylvanian writer and Habsburg loyalist. Beyond politics, Seara <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> news on culture, selected for publishing by Ion Vinea and poet Jacques G. Costin.|$|E
5|$|Montoya {{made his}} pit stop on lap 22. However, his pit stop proved problematic: the signal lights at his pit box stopped working, causing the Williams refuller {{to switch to}} the fuel rig for Ralf Schumacher and Montoya {{remained}} stationary for 20 seconds longer than usual. Montoya was also fuelled for longer than his team planned. Ralf Schumacher thus inherited the lead with Michael Schumacher behind him and Montoya re-emerged in fourth place. One lap later, Michael Schumacher took his pit stop and he <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> a fuel pressure problem which meant he pulled {{to the side of}} the main straight and retired. Burti spun off and beached his car in the gravel trap at Nordkurve on the same lap. Ralf Schumacher made his pit stop on lap 24 and rejoined with a 10-second advantage. Villeneuve, Button and Alonso all followed Ralf Schumacher into the pit lane on the same lap. Alonso encountered a problem when leaving his pit box: the Minardi refuelling valve had a problem, and his car's afterburner remained on, though the flames extinguished themselves when Alonso accelerated out of the pit lane. Montoya pulled over {{to the side of the}} track on lap 25, with smoke billowing from his engine, and retired. Fisichella made a pit stop from fourth on lap 26 and re-emerged in fifth behind Villeneuve. Marques retired from the race with a gearbox problem on the same lap. Coulthard made a pit stop on lap 27 and immediately became the race's next retirement when he acclerated away from his pit box with a blown engine. The resulting event meant he pulled to the side of the circuit. Panis made his pit stop on lap 31 and came out behind Button and Alesi. Barrichello became the final driver to make a scheduled pit stop on the 32nd lap.|$|E
5|$|On March 13, Michigan {{received}} an at-large bid to the 2016 NCAA Tournament. The Wolverines are the No. 11 {{seed in the}} East Region and faced No. 11 Tulsa in the First Four on March 16 in Dayton, Ohio. Michigan is in the tournament field {{for the fifth time}} in the last six seasons after missing out on the 2015 tournament field. Beilein's Wolverines advanced to the national title game in 2013 and followed with an Elite Eight performance in 2014. Michigan is one of three Big Ten teams in the east region (along with Wisconsin and Indiana). On March 16 in the First Four, Michigan defeated Tulsa, 67–62, to advance to the First Round of the NCAA Tournament. After falling behind 16–9, Michigan ended the first half on a 19–4 scoring run to take an eight-point lead into halftime. Irvin hit the go-ahead three-pointer with 53 seconds left to put the Wolverines up by two points. Michigan was led by Abdur-Rahkman and Irvin with 16 points, while Robinson recorded his first double-double with 13 points and 11 rebounds. The game was the first-ever meeting between the two teams in program history. Michigan recorded six three-pointers in the game to extend their single-season record for three-pointers in a season to 332. On March 18, Michigan lost to No. 6 seed Notre Dame, 63–70. Michigan finished the first half on a 7–0 run to take a 41–29 lead at halftime. Notre Dame <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> a 15–5 run to start the second half, cutting Michigan's lead to three points. Notre Dame did not take a lead in the game until Beacham's three-pointer with 9:26 left to make it 51–48. From there on there were five lead changes and three ties. Abdur-Rahkman led Michigan in scoring with 15 points, four rebounds, three assists and one steal, while Walton recorded a career-high six steals, along with 10 points, eight assists and four rebounds. Michigan recorded 10 three-pointers in the game to extend their single-season record for three-pointers in a season to 342.|$|E
