5000|$|On 1 April 2016, ADS {{confirmed}} {{that it was}} working to resolve manufacturing faults affecting fourteen propeller gear boxes (PGBs) produced by TP400 supplier Europrop International (EPI) {{in the first half}} of 2015. The gearboxes are made by Italian supplier Avio Aero, owned by General Electric. The issue involved a specific heat treatment process in manufacturing that adversely affected the strength of the ring gear; no other PGBs before or since were affected and the units involved either have been or are being changed. Airbus noted that [...] "pending full replacement of the batch, any aircraft can continue to fly with no more than one affected propeller gear box installed and is subject to continuing inspections." [...] Another PGB issue involves cracking of the input pinion plug, which in some cases can result in the release of small metallic particles into the oil system, where they are detected by a magnetic <b>chip</b> <b>detector.</b> Only engines 1 and 3, which have propellers that rotate to the right, are affected. The European Aviation Safety Agency has issued an Airworthiness Directive mandating immediate on-wing inspection, followed by replacement if evidence of damage is found, or else return-to-service and continuing inspections. On 27 April 2016, when delivering Q1 2016 financial results, Airbus warned there could be a significant cost in repairing the gearbox. In June 2016, two German A400Ms received in December 2014 - aircraft 54-01 and 54-02 - were temporarily grounded after inspections found heavy engine wear in the clockwise rotation PGBs after only 365 and 189 hours of operations, respectively. An interim fix for this PGB issue was certified in July 2016, which extends the inspection phase from 100 hours to 650 hours, with follow-up inspections every 150 hours, up from 20 hours.|$|E

40|$|A {{prototype}} instrument {{has been}} developed that enables the quantification of significant metallic wear debris captured on either a filter patch (also known as a porous membrane) or a magnetic <b>chip</b> <b>detector.</b> With the introduction of fine filtration to machinery lubrication systems, the effectiveness of traditional oil analysis methods such as Spectrometric Oil Analysis (SOA) is significantly reduced, often {{to the point where}} it ceases to provide useful information about machinery health. The filter element in a lubrication system is a rich source of machinery health information however it is not often considered or exploited for condition monitoring. Whilst the filter patch technique is a convenient way for extracting the debris from a filter element, analysis of the captured debris has traditionally been tedious, time consuming and can lack repeatability. Other methods do exist to quantify filter debris, however they typically involve the transportation of the entire filter element to a laboratory, which is not always practical. The instrument that {{has been developed}} enables the metallic content of a filter patch to be quantified for trending or to identify which filter patches require further detailed examination.

The target accuracy for a sensor based on this chip is 0, 01 degree of arc 1 o which would give an unprecedented level of performance. The actual sensor could be {{the same size as the}} chip although a slight increase in height would be needed (0, 8 mm) in case no connections would be required. An actual application however would require both power to be supplied to the chip as well as data connections to and from the chip. In order to optimize the total system size and mass, TNO has been investigating several approaches among which autonomous powering through a dedicated solarcell and wiretess data communication. In all cases investigated the peripheral circuitry by far exceeds the actual sensor core. In a number of cases the connector is even the largest part of the system. Since alignment problems have to be taken into account also (10 µm error on a 5 mm sensor constitutes a 2 mrad or approximately 0, 01 degree alignment error) our tendency is to look at micro sunsensors as part of integrated sensor systems. Further miniaturization of sunsensors (from micro to nano) is currently seen as not profitable as the size of the overall system will not be significantly Influenced by a smaller sensor. Since there is no clear definition for a nano sensor (the above mentioned chip uses a 180 nm CMOS process so could be considered a nano sensor with a lot of fantasy) the discussion will be blurred, but our preliminary conclusion is that no further mintaturization of the sensor is ret quired. A similar effort to minimize the peripheral circuitry will have a much larger effect on the overall system size.

40|$|International audienceXPAD 3 is {{a single}} photon {{counting}} chip based on hybrid pixel counters, with low noise, high dynamics and high speed readout. Its features have been improved to provide an high counting rate capability, a very low threshold, an energy discrimination and a fast image readout. The chip is designed in 0. 25 μm IBM technology, and contains 9600 pixels (130 μm x 130 μm) distributed into 80 columns of 120 elements each. An innovative architecture has been designed {{in order to prevent}} the digital circuits from disturbing the very sensitive analogue cells. XPAD 3 was realized into two versions. The XPAD 3 -S version accepts positive input charges and offers an energy range from 4 keV to 40 keV with a single threshold. The XPAD 3 -C version accepts negative input charge and has an energy range from 6 keV to 60 keV with a windowed energy selection set by two independent thresholds.

40|$|Timepix chip detectors, being quantum area pixel {{electron}} detectors, provide greater {{incident particle}} energy specificity {{and are less}} noise sensitive than traditional integrating electron detector systems. Moreover, the charge sharing properties of the Timepix detector provide a potential opportunity for superresolution, increasing the effective detection resolution beyond the 55 μm pixel pitch and improving transmission electron microscope imaging. However, {{little is known about}} the trajectories and corresponding observed tracks of 300 keV electrons [...] - as typically used in transmission electron microscopy [...] - in silicon. The goal of this project is to generate simulated 300 keV electron trajectories and emulate charge carrier transport and Timepix pixel function to obtain a set of pixel tracks resembling those observed during irradiation of a Timepix <b>chip</b> <b>detector</b> with 300 keV electrons. Simulated electron trajectories were obtained using Geant 4; subsequently, charge sharing was simulated using an energy deposition [...] to [...] pixel distance power law approximation (qpixel ∝ Δxpixel- 3). Using a Gaussian Fano noise approximation, an optimum correspondence of Gaussian peak fit sigma to peak position ratio was found at a simulated Fano factor of 0. 0915. This optimum simulated Fano factor is within 25 % of Fano factors obtained in prior ab initio Fano simulations. Additionally, both observed and simulated pixel track signal intensities were added together aligned by peak signal pixel, in which a pixel charge carrier threshold was applied to all individual pixels in each simulated pixel track. At a pixel charge carrier threshold of + 4. 0 × 104 e to each individual simulated pixel tracks, the ratio between peak pixel row and column signal and the bordering pixel rows and columns is equal for both observed and simulated cumulative tracks. Yet, observed cumulative track tails contain more signal compared to peak level than simulated cumulative track tails; this effect is well explained by the non-linearity of Timepix pixel response to incident charges. These results indicate that it may be feasible to accurately recreate Timepix 300 keV electron pixel tracks using computer simulations; still, more in-depth research towards scattering of 300 keV electron tracks in silicon and towards resulting charge carrier production and transport is needed to ascertain whether superresolution transmission electron microscope imaging is in any way feasible in Timepix chip detectors.

40|$|A few {{components}} and debris collected from an aeroengine retrieved {{from the wreckage}} of a crashed helicopter were sent to this laboratory for analysis. The items received for laboratory tests/investigation are: (a) drive sleeve, (b) coupling sleeve, (c) debris/deposits and (d) non-metallic pieces collected from {{various parts of the}} engine, and (e) metal pieces collected from magnetic <b>chip</b> <b>detector</b> (MCD). Debris collected from various parts of the engine was found to be either dust and soil or fragments of non-metallic fabric that was used {{in some parts of the}} engine. Compositional analysis confirmed that the metallic particles collected from the MCD were from the shaved off splines of drive and coupling sleeves. The mode of failure in the drive and coupling sleeves was identified to be progressive in nature. There were three fatigue cracks in the coupling sleeve; all of them being initiated at the spline root region. However, it is to be noted that no fracture was associated with these cracks. Hence, fatigue cracks per se were not responsible for the failure of the drive and coupling sleeves. Rather, evidences suggest that the fatigue crack initiation and propagation had occurred subsequent to some other mechanism of failure. It was not possible to unambiguously establish the mode of failure of the splines of the drive and coupling sleeves because of the severe destruction that took place following the failure. But, there were tell-tale marks on the working flank of the available portion of the splines, which were indicative of relative movement between these components in the axial direction. Considering the nature of failure in the present case, this assumes significance. Analysis shows that in the event of such movement, wear on the meshing surfaces of the splines is inevitable. As wear progresses, the clearance between the engaging splines increases. This induces cyclic load of higher magnitude on the splines which increases the vulnerability for fatigue crack initiation at the spline root region. Moreover, the wear on the splines results in loss of material and thereby reduces cross section of the splines. When the cross section reduces to critical limit such that the splines can no longer sustain the application load, they fold or shear off. Although direct evidences to this proposed mechanism is scarce on the component because of the post failure destruction, available signatures, however, point towards such a sequence of failure. This is further supported by metallurgical investigation wherein both drive and coupling sleeves were found conforming to the specifications with respect to (a) chemical composition, (b) microstructure, (c) surface treatment, and (d) hardness profile. The reason(s) for possible axial movement between the drive and coupling sleeves, however, could not be established from the laboratory investigation. In view of the progressive failure in the drive and coupling sleeves, it is justifiable to state that the failure in these components was primarily responsible for the sudden loss of power in the engine. This report provides a detailed account of laboratory investigation with test results and analysis. Also, a few recommendations are suggested for identification of probable cause(s) which could give rise to axial movement between drive and coupling sleeves...|$|E
