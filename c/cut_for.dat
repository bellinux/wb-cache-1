5|$|A 3-CD {{set of the}} Tertiary Phase was {{released}} in mid-October 2004, before the final episodes were broadcast. These CDs contain extended material, previously cut to make 27-minute episodes for radio. A 2-CD set of the Quandary Phase {{was released}} {{at the end of}} May 2005, and a 2-CD set of the Quintessential Phase was released at the end of June 2005. Both sets again include material that was originally <b>cut</b> <b>for</b> reasons of timing.|$|E
5|$|A longer 116-minute copy of {{the film}} has not been {{released}} officially, but has been found as a bootleg. This copy is a poor-quality videocassette dub and has a burned-in time code in the corner indicating that the film was not meant for public viewing. However, the European, Japanese and Australian DVD releases restore three minutes of the violent footage missing from the Region 1 DVD (that was <b>cut</b> <b>for</b> an R rating), making them the versions closest to Woo's original cut.|$|E
5|$|After being <b>cut</b> <b>for</b> {{the second}} time by the Blue Bombers, Alford {{moved back to the}} United States and worked in a glove factory in Memphis. He {{expected}} that his professional football career was over, but he was signed by the Montreal Alouettes in 1999. During training camp, he competed against 11 other receivers for a place on the active roster, with head coach Charlie Taaffe expecting to cut at least five receivers. Alford failed to make the active roster and was released {{before the start of the}} regular season.|$|E

5|$|Garamond {{worked as}} an {{engraver}} of punches, the masters used to stamp matrices, the moulds used to cast metal type. His designs followed the model of an influential design <b>cut</b> <b>for</b> Venetian printer Aldus Manutius by his punchcutter Francesco Griffo in 1495, and helped to establish {{what is now called}} the old-style serif letter design, letters with a relatively organic structure resembling handwriting with a pen, but with a slightly more structured and upright design.|$|E
5|$|M-146 {{was a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan that initially served as a bypass for traffic going around Port Huron and as a short <b>cut</b> <b>for</b> traffic between U.S. Highway25 (US 25) and M-21. Later it connected to the Blue Water Bridge before it was truncated to its final form. Segments of M-146 still exist today as state highways as part of Interstate94 (I-94) and I-69 and the Lapeer Connector.|$|E
5|$|On 17 February 2012, Henry {{returned}} to Red Bulls {{to prepare for}} the 2012 season.

40|$|Abstract. We analyze split {{cuts from}} the {{perspective}} of cut generating functions via geometric lifting. We show that α-cuts, a natural higher-dimensional generalization of the k-cuts of Cornuéjols et al., gives all the split <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> the mixed-integer corner relaxation. As an immediate consequence we obtain that the k-cuts are equivalent to split <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> the 1 -row mixed-integer relaxation. Further, we show that split <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> finite-dimensional corner relaxations are restrictions of split <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> the infinite-dimensional relaxation. In a final application of this equivalence, we exhibit a family of pure-integer programs whose split closure have arbitrarily bad integrality gap. This complements the mixed-integer ex-ample provided by Basu et al. ...|$|R

5|$|Since the 17th century, peat {{has been}} <b>cut</b> <b>for</b> fuel for {{domestic}} heating and cooking {{and it is}} called turf when so used. The process accelerated as commercial exploitation of bogs grew. In the 1940s, machines for cutting turf were introduced and larger-scale exploitation became possible. In the Republic, this became the responsibility of a semi-state company called Bord na Móna. In addition to domestic uses, commercially extracted turf is used {{in a number of}} industries, especially electricity generation though peat is being combined with biomass for dual-firing electricity generation.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{generalization}} of split and intersection cuts from Mixed Integer Linear Pro-gramming {{to the realm}} of Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming. Constructing such cuts requires calculating the convex hull of the difference of two convex sets with specific geometric structures. We introduce two techniques to give precise characterizations of such convex hulls and use them to construct split and intersection <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> several classes of sets. In particular, we give simple formulas <b>for</b> split <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> essentially all convex sets described by a single quadratic inequality and for more general intersection <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> a wide variety of convex quadratic sets...|$|R

5|$|Tuition is {{paid for}} by general {{taxation}} in Germany, although only 27% of young people gain higher education qualification there, whereas in the UK the comparable figure is 48%. Fully or partly funding universities from general taxation has been criticised by the Liberal Democrat party as a 'tax <b>cut</b> <b>for</b> the rich and a tax rise for the poor' because people would be taxed to pay for something that many would not derive a benefit from, while graduates generally earn more due to their qualifications and only have to pay them back.|$|E
5|$|During the eight-month period, Beyoncé {{recorded}} over seventy {{songs and}} decided during the editing process {{that she did}} not want to reconcile the two approaches into one disc. If a song was meaningless to her, she cut them off during the process of elimination for the final track listing. After a process of elimination, twelve tracks were selected to be placed on the standard edition of the album, while five additional tracks were chosen to make the final <b>cut</b> <b>for</b> the deluxe edition of the album. Beyoncé later revealed that songs from established producers like The Neptunes and Danja were not able to make the final cut.|$|E
5|$|Mariah Carey is {{the debut}} studio album by American singer Mariah Carey, {{released}} on June 12, 1990 by Columbia Records. Its music incorporates {{a range of}} contemporary genres {{with a mix of}} slow ballads and up-tempo tracks. Originally, Carey wrote four songs with Ben Margulies, which solely constituted her demo tape. While altered and partially re-sung after being signed to Columbia, all four songs made the final <b>cut</b> <b>for</b> the album. Aside from Margulies, Carey worked with a range of professional writers and producers, all of whom were hired by Columbia CEO, Tommy Mottola. Mariah Carey featured production and writing from Rhett Lawrence, Ric Wake and Narada Michael Walden, all of whom were top record producers at the time. Together with Carey, they conceived the album and reconstructed her original demo tape.|$|E

5|$|The first European American {{settlers}} {{arrived in}} Chingleclamouche Township in about 1793, {{and the first}} sawmill in Clearfield County began operating in 1805. Settlers initially occupied land along the river and creeks, as these provided a means of transportation. Some settlers would harvest timber and float it downstream once a year to make money for items they could not produce themselves, but by 1820 the first full-time lumbering operations began in the region. The white pine was the most sought after tree, yielding spars for ships and timber for buildings. Hardwoods were also harvested, and eventually hemlocks were <b>cut</b> <b>for</b> their wood and their bark, which contained tannins used in tanning leather.|$|E
5|$|The navigations often form a short <b>cut</b> <b>for</b> boaters {{between the}} River Nene at Peterborough and the River Great Ouse at Salters Lode Lock. The {{suggested}} route passes through Stanground Sluice, along King's Dyke to Ashline Lock, and then along Whittlesey Dike to Flood's Ferry junction. From here the route is along the old {{course of the}} River Nene, passing through the twin villages of Outwell and Upwell, where the abandoned Wisbech Canal once formed a route back to the new course of the River Nene. The final stretch to Salters Lode lock is along Well Creek, passing {{over the top of}} the Middle Level Main Drain on Mullicourt Aqueduct.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, the badnjak {{ceremony}} {{begins on}} Christmas Eve, {{but there are}} many regional variations surrounding the details. Early in the morning the head of each family, usually accompanied by several male relatives, selects and fells the tree from which a log will be <b>cut</b> <b>for</b> their household. The group announces its departure by firing guns or small celebratory mortars called prangija. The Turkey oak is the most popular species of tree selected in most regions, but other oaks are also chosen. Beech, pear, quince, hornbeam, and plum trees are used in eastern Serbia, although less frequently than oak trees. In some areas of Montenegrin Littoral where oaks do not grow, olives, bay laurels, elms, or strawberry trees are used instead. Young, straight, and undamaged specimens are preferred. The badnjak may be more valued if it is felled stealthily in someone else's rather than in one's own woods.|$|E

Besides the new character artwork by Gibbons during conversations, the Director's Cut also features a new first person view for certain puzzles. In the DS version, there is no spoken dialogue, only subtitles. A version of the Director's <b>Cut</b> <b>for</b> iPhone and iPod Touch was released on January 20, 2010. In May 2010, a version with higher resolution and a digital comic was released on the iPad. A PC version was released on August 27, 2010 on various digital distribution services. An Android version, which is an enhanced version of the iPhone version, was released on Google Play on June 28, 2012. The Wii and Nintendo DS versions of the Director's Cut are available only in stores.|$|E
5|$|With {{the onset}} of the recession, the UK {{government}} lead calls to stimulate aggregate demand. Throughout 2008, a number of fiscal measuresincluding a £145 tax <b>cut</b> <b>for</b> basic rate (below £34,800 pa earnings) tax payers, a temporary 2.5% cut in Value Added Tax (VAT), £3billion worth of spending brought forward from 2010 and a £20billion Small Enterprise Loan Guarantee Schemewere introduced. The cost of these measures, most of which were announced in the November 2008 Pre-Budget Report, was about £20billion excluding counting loan guarantees. Further measures worth £5billionincluding training for the young unemployed and a car scrappage scheme which offered a £2,000 subsidy for the purchase of a new car in exchange for the scrapping of a car more than 10 years oldwere announced in the 2009 budget.|$|E
5|$|At 12, Westenra {{entered a}} {{professional}} recording studio to record Walking in the Air, a demo album originally created {{for friends and}} family. At first, her parents paid for 70 copies; soon after, 1,000 more were <b>cut</b> <b>for</b> sale, hand-out, and publicity. After finishing her album, Westenra and her sister Sophie busked in Christchurch, giving away {{a few of the}} original 70 albums (at the behest of passersby) and selling some of the latter 1000. The pair drew large crowds, and one woman asked the girls if they had ever recorded anything. The woman, a journalist with Canterbury Television, asked Westenra to appear on air. Gray Bartlett, the director of a concert promotion company, saw the show and became interested in working with Westenra. Shortly after, she was offered a recording deal with Universal Records New Zealand. On that label, Westenra, who in the meantime was attending Burnside High School, released a self-titled album of show tunes and light classical songs, as well as My Gift to You, a CD of Christmas music. Following the success of her albums, she was offered and later received lessons from Dame Malvina Major.|$|E
