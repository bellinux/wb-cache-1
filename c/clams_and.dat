5|$|All nemerteans move slowly, {{using their}} {{external}} cilia {{to glide on}} surfaces on a trail of slime, while larger species use muscular waves to crawl, and some swim by dorso-ventral undulations. A few live in the open ocean while the rest find or make hiding places on the bottom. About a dozen species inhabit freshwater, mainly in the tropics and subtropics, and another dozen species live on land in cool, damp places. Most nemerteans are carnivores, feeding on annelids, <b>clams</b> <b>and</b> crustaceans. A few species are scavengers, and a few species live commensally inside the mantle cavity of molluscs. Some species have devastated commercial fishing of <b>clams</b> <b>and</b> crabs. Nemerteans have few predators. Two species are sold as fish bait.|$|E
5|$|Most are carnivores, {{feeding on}} annelids, <b>clams</b> <b>and</b> crustaceans, and may kill annelids of {{about their own}} size. They {{sometimes}} take fish, both living and dead. Insects and myriapods are the only known prey of the two terrestrial species of Argonemertes.|$|E

5|$|Sea otters consume over 100 {{different}} prey species. In {{most of its}} range, the sea otter's diet consists {{almost exclusively}} of marine benthic invertebrates, including sea urchins, fat innkeeper worms, a variety of bivalves such as <b>clams</b> <b>and</b> mussels, abalone, other mollusks, crustaceans, and snails. Its prey ranges in size from tiny limpets and crabs to giant octopuses. Where prey such as sea urchins, <b>clams,</b> <b>and</b> abalone are present {{in a range of}} sizes, sea otters tend to select larger items over smaller ones of similar type. In California, they have been noted to ignore Pismo clams smaller than 3inches (7cm) across.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{this ability}} to digest food outside the body, starfish can hunt prey much larger than their mouths. Their diets include <b>clams</b> <b>and</b> oysters, arthropods, small fish and {{gastropod}} molluscs. Some starfish are not pure carnivores, supplementing their diets with algae or organic detritus. Some of these species are grazers, but others trap food particles from the water in sticky mucus strands that are swept towards the mouth along ciliated grooves.|$|E
5|$|Order Bdellonemertea. Includes seven species, {{of which}} six live as commensals in {{the mantle of}} large <b>clams</b> <b>and</b> one in that of a {{freshwater}} snail. The hosts filter feed and all the hosts steal food from them. These nemerteans have short, wide bodies and have no stylets but have a sucking pharynx and a posterior stucker, with which they move like inchworms.|$|E

5|$|Some {{of the sea}} otter's {{preferred}} prey species, particularly abalone, <b>clams,</b> <b>and</b> crabs, {{are also}} food sources for humans. In some areas, massive declines in shellfish harvests have been blamed on the sea otter, and intense public debate has taken place over how to manage the competition between sea otters and humans for seafood.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all {{octopuses}} are predatory; bottom-dwelling octopuses eat mainly crustaceans, polychaete worms, {{and other}} molluscs such as whelks and clams; open-ocean octopuses eat mainly prawns, {{fish and other}} cephalopods. Major items in the diet of the giant Pacific octopus include bivalve molluscs such as the cockle Clinocardium nuttallii, <b>clams</b> <b>and</b> scallops, and crustaceans such as crabs and spider crabs. Prey that {{it is likely to}} reject include moon snails, because they are too large, and limpets, rock scallops, chitons and abalone, because they are too securely fixed to the rock.|$|E
5|$|The Fonteyn Kill and its {{riparian}} zone {{are home to}} a variety of species. Caddisflies, <b>clams</b> <b>and</b> mussels, crayfish (Astacidae), damselflies, gammarids, isopods (Asellidae), oligochaetes, black flies, leeches, chironomids, bladder snails, and other snails were recorded in the stream in 2010. Trees {{along the banks of the}} Fonteyn Kill include American elms, sugar maples, black cherries, Norway maples, and red maples, while barberry, privet, holly, Japanese knotweed, honeysuckle, spicebush, common reeds, and Japanese roses make up the kill's riparian shrubs. Carp, mallards, great blue herons, frogs, snapping turtles, and other birds also reside in and around the stream. A 1924 source observed that trout fishing occurred on the kill.|$|E

5|$|The diet of {{the leopard}} shark {{consists}} of small benthic and littoral animals, most significantly crabs (Cancridae, Grapsidae, and Hippoidea), shrimp, bony fish (including anchovies, herring, topsmelt, croakers, surfperch, gobies, rockfish, sculpins, flatfish, and midshipmen), fish eggs, <b>clams,</b> <b>and</b> the echiurid fat innkeeper worm (Urechis caupo). This opportunistic hunter {{has also been}} known to eat ghost shrimp, polychaete worms, and the young of smoothhounds, shovelnose guitarfish (Rhinobatos productus), and bat rays (Myliobatis californicus). Eelgrass (Zostera) and algae may be swallowed incidentally.|$|E
5|$|There {{are various}} types of shallow-water coral reef, {{including}} fringing reefs, barrier reefs and atolls; most occur in tropical and subtropical seas. They are very slow-growing, adding perhaps one centimetre (0.4in) in height each year. The Great Barrier Reef {{is thought to have}} been laid down about two million years ago. Over time, corals fragment and die, sand and rubble accumulates between the corals, and the shells of <b>clams</b> <b>and</b> other molluscs decay to form a gradually evolving calcium carbonate structure. Coral reefs are extremely diverse marine ecosystems hosting over 4,000 species of fish, massive numbers of cnidarians, molluscs, crustaceans, and many other animals.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{that are}} {{important}} to the marsh rice rat's diet include insects, fiddler crabs, and snails, but the species is known to eat many other animals, including fish, <b>clams,</b> <b>and</b> juvenile Graptemys and Chrysemys turtles. They scavenge on carcasses of muskrats, deermice, and sparrows, and {{may be the most important}} predator on eggs and young of the marsh wren. Rice rats also eat eggs and young of the seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus) and are aggressive towards the sparrow, apparently leading it to avoid nesting in Juncus in a seaside salt marsh in Florida. On islands in North Carolina, rice rats consume eggs of Forster's tern (Sterna forsteri). They have been observed preying on alligator eggs in Georgia.|$|E

5|$|The {{fresh water}} {{entering}} Florida Bay from the Everglades creates ideal conditions for vast beds of turtle grass and algae formations that foster animal {{life in the}} bay. Sea turtles and manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris) eat the grass, while invertebrates such as worms, <b>clams,</b> <b>and</b> other mollusks consume algae formations and microscopic plankton. Female sea turtles return annually to nest on the shore, and manatees spend the winter months in the warmer water of the bay. The Calusa Indians had various uses for shells of marine invertebrates, {{due to the lack}} of dense rock with which to make tools. They used the horse conch (Pleuroploca gigantea), left-handed whelk (Busycon contrarium), and the Florida crown conch (Melongena corona) as drinking vessels, picks, hammers, knives and awls.|$|E
5|$|All {{pinnipeds}} are carnivorous and predatory. As a whole, {{they mostly}} feed on fish and cephalopods, followed by crustaceans and bivalves, and then zooplankton and endothermic ("warm-blooded") prey like sea birds. While most species are generalist and opportunistic feeders, {{a few are}} specialists. Examples include the crabeater seal, which primarily eats krill, the ringed seal, which eats mainly crustaceans, the Ross seal and southern elephant seal, which specialize on squid, and the bearded seal and walrus, which feed on <b>clams</b> <b>and</b> other bottom-dwelling invertebrates. Pinnipeds may hunt solitarily or cooperatively. The former behavior is typical when hunting non-schooling fish, slow-moving or immobile invertebrates or endothermic prey. Solitary foraging species usually exploit coastal waters, bays and rivers. An exception to this is the northern elephant seal, which feeds on fish at great depths in the open ocean. In addition, walruses feed solitarily but are often near other walruses in small or large groups that may surface and dive in unison. When large schools of fish or squid are available, pinnipeds such as certain otariids hunt cooperatively in large groups, locating and herding their prey. Some species, such as California and South American sea lions, may forage with cetaceans and sea birds.|$|E
5|$|C.maenas is a predator, {{feeding on}} many organisms, {{particularly}} bivalve molluscs (such as clams, oysters, and mussels), polychaetes and small crustaceans. They are primarily nocturnal, although activity {{also depends on}} the tide, and crabs can be active {{at any time of}} day. In California, preferential predation of C.maenas on native clams (Nutricola spp.) resulted in the decline of the native <b>clams</b> <b>and</b> an increase of a previously introduced clam (the amethyst gem clam, Gemma gemma). C.maenas has been implicated in the destruction of the soft-shell clam (Mya arenaria) fisheries on the east coast of the United States and Canada, and the reduction of populations of other commercially important bivalves (such as scallops, Argopecten irradians, and northern quahogs, Mercenaria mercenaria). The prey of C.maenas includes the young of bivalves and fish, although the effect of its predation on winter flounder, Pseudopleuronectes americanus is minimal. C.maenas can, however, have substantial negative impacts on local commercial and recreational fisheries, by preying on the young of species, such as oysters and the Dungeness crab, or competing with them for resources.|$|E
