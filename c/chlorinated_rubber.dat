These have many disadvantages though, such as poor mechanical strength and sensitivity to oxidation. Thus, soluble matrix paints can only remain functional for a 12-15 month period, and are unsuitable for slow vessels. In contrast, insoluble matrix paints must use higher molecular weight binders: acrylics, vinyls, <b>chlorinated</b> <b>rubbers,</b> etc. and maintain stronger resistance to oxidation.

50|$|Putting on latex {{clothing}} can be difficult, because latex {{has high}} friction against dry skin. To {{make it easier}} to put on, wearers often use talc to reduce friction against the skin when putting the clothes on; then, because stray talc is very visible against the rubber, wearers generally polish off any visible talc. Another method of dressing is using lubricant (or 'lube') which provides a slippery surface for the latex to glide over. A third method of reducing or eliminating the high friction of latex when dressing is to <b>chlorinate</b> the <b>rubber.</b> Chlorine in gaseous form is generated by the reaction of hydrochloric acid and sodium hypochlorite. This chlorine bonds to the first few molecules {{on the surface of the}} isoprene (latex) and transforms them into neoprene. This process affects metallic colours, but does not affect strength.|$|R
40|$|The {{internal}} {{energy and the}} entropy components of the elastic restoring force in rubbers were determined for natural rubber up to an extension ratio of about 3. 0. Four different experimental measurements were necessary to determine these components: (1) the force-temperature coefficient at constant temperature and length; (2) the force-pressure coefficient at constant temperature and length; (3) the thermal expansion coefficient at constant length; and (4) the isothermal compressibility at constant length. The force-temperature and the force-pressure coefficients were functions of strain whereas the expansion coefficients and the isothermal compressibilities were independent of strain. These measurements gave an {{internal energy}} contribution of 23 % for natural rubber independent of the strain over the range of extensions studied. To describe the thermal {{as well as the}} elastic behavior of rubbers a new phenomenological description of elastomers based on a generalized measure of strain was developed. The incompressible form of the strain energy function correctly described the elastic data on various elastomers (natural <b>rubber,</b> styrene-butadiene <b>rubber,</b> <b>chlorinated</b> ethylene-propylene copolymer <b>rubber)</b> in both homogeneous and non-homogeneous deformation fields. For a given rubber the same set of parameters fitted the data in simple tension, simple compression, equal biaxial tension and pure shear up to the point of rupture. The compressible form of the strain energy function also described the thermoelastic data on natural rubber. The thermoelastic data on <b>chlorinated</b> ethylene-propylene copolymer <b>rubber,</b> taken out of the literature, were also predicted. From the new strain energy function it was possible to determine the interchain interactions. For natural rubber the interchain energy effects were found to be small (4 %) as compared to the intrachain energy effects. The experimental results on natural rubber established the range of validity of the statistical mechanical (molecular) and the continuum mechanical (phenomenological) theories. The temperature coefficient of the unperturbed dimensions of natural rubber determined from the internal energy component of the force yielded the conformational energies associated with the cis-polyisoprene chain...|$|R

50|$|The {{decommissioning}} {{begins with}} the draining of fuel and fire fighting liquid, which is sold to the trade. Any re-usable itemsâwiring, furniture and machineryâare sent to local markets or the trade. Unwanted materials become inputs to their relevant waste streams. Often, in lower income nations, these industries are no better than ship breaking. For example, the toxic insulation is usually burnt off copper wire to access the metal. Some crude safety precautions existâchickens are lowered into the chambers of the ship, and if the birds return alive, they are considered safe. Workers also do not have proper clothing, footwear and masks.Sledgehammers and oxy-acetylene gas-torches are used to cut up the steel hull. Cranes are not typically used on the ship, because of costs. Pieces of the hull simply fall off and are dragged inland, possibly aided with a winch or bulldozer. These are then cut into smaller pieces away from the coast. 90% of the steel is re-rollable scrap: higher quality steel plates that are heated and reused as reinforcement bar for construction. The remainder is transported to electric arc furnaces to be melted down into ingots for re-rolling mills. In the re-rolling mills, the heating of painted steel plates (in particular, those painted with <b>chlorinated</b> <b>rubber</b> paints) generates dioxins. Substances which are costly to dispose of, such as hazardous waste, are left on the beach or set on fire, even old batteries and half-empty cans of paint.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of {{the thermal}} decompositions of <b>chlorinated</b> natural <b>rubber</b> (CNR) from latex under both air and nitrogen atmospheres were studied with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The thermooxidative decomposition of CNR had two weight-loss step {{changes in the}} TGA curves, which occurred at the two distinct temperature ranges of about 160 - 390 and 390 - 850 Â°C, respectively. The gaseous products of the first step change were mainly HCl with a little CO 2, and the apparent reaction order (n) was 1. 1. The reaction activation energy (E) increased linearly with the increment of heating rate (B), and the apparent activation energy (E 0), calculated by extrapolation back to zero B, was 101. 7 kJ/mol. Bs ranging from 5 to 30 Â°C/min were used. The initial temperature of weight loss (T 0) was 1. 31 B + 252 Â°C, where B is in degrees Celsius per minute. The final temperature of weight loss (Tf) was 0. 93 B + 310 Â°C, and the temperature of maximum weight-loss rate (Tp) was 1. 03 B + 287 Â°C. The decomposition weight-loss percentage at Tp (Cp) and that at Tf(Cf) were not affected by B, and the average values were 38 and 60 %, respectively. The second weight-loss step change was an oxidative decomposition of the molecular main chain. The value of n was 1. 1. E increased linearly with the increment of B, and E 0 was 125. 0 kJ/mol. Cf after the second step approached 100 %, which indicated complete decomposition. The thermal decomposition of CNR in a N 2 atmosphere had only one weight-loss step change with an n of 1. 1. E increased linearly with the increment of B, and E 0 was 98. 6 kJ/mol. T 0 was 1. 25 B + 251 Â°C, Tf was 0. 91 B + 315 Â°C, and Tp was 1. 09 B + 286 Â°C. Cp and Cf were not affected by B, and the average values were 37 and 68 %, respectively. The weight percentage of more stable, nonthermal decomposed residue was about 30 %. The thermal decompositions of CNR in both atmospheres were similar, mainly by dehydrochlorination, at the low temperature range (160 - 390 Â°C) but were different at the high temperature range (390 - 850 Â°C).

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was the {{development}} of screening methods for the identification and quantification of plastic additives, their degradation products, residual solvents and degrada-tion products of the polymer materials. After having done comprehensive researches on the subject in literature and communication with different manufacturers of plastics and elastom-ers an overview was compiled about commonly used plastic additives and additionally degra-dation products and residual solvents which often migrate. For volatile extractables and leach-ables a HS-GC-FID was developed and for semi volatile components the GC-MS with direct injection was used. The HPLC-UV and the UPLC-UV-MS were applied for the determination of non volatile compounds. With these screening methods 64 potential extractables like anti-oxidants, UV stabilizers, plasticizers, lubricants, silicone derivates or residual solvents could be identified. By means of selected substances which represented {{a broad range of}} chemical and physical properties it could be shown that these methods are amenable to validation. Solely the contrast medium led to difficulties during validation of the HPLC-UV method caused by the highly concentrated radio-opaque substance which results in overloading of the column. An optimized sample preparation shall avoid these effects. Extraction with non polar solvents could be an opportunity. Additionally extraction methods for the investigation of different plastic and elastomers con-cerning their extractable profiles after extraction with water, isopropanol and hexane were developed. The plastic additives Irganox 1010, BHT, Irganox 1076, MTBC, DEHP, stearic acid, sulphur, as well as residual solvents and degradation products like different tertiary alco-hols (p. a. t-butanole), 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanole, various hydrocarbons (p. a. dodecane, tetradecane, eicosane, tetracosane), Irgafos 168 oxide, palmitic-, myristic acid, benzyls and silicone deri-vates were the commonly extracted substances. These extractable profiles serve as an essential basis for assessing the suitability of materials as primary packaging materials during the development of new container closure systems. Thus COP, COC, PC and PP as plastics and the <b>chlorinated</b> butyl <b>rubbers</b> C and D would be appropriated. The extractable profiles of these materials are least comprehensive. Among these properties additional factors are important during the development of packaging, p. a. process ability and barrier properties. A compromise between these claims shall be identified. Afterwards oneâs own hand assembled devices, filled with water or rather contrast medium, was investigated concerning their migration profiles. These devices (cartridges and vials with different composition) were being stored at 40 Â°C and 75 % relatively humidity for six months. After sterilization, tri- and the storage for six month the devices were investigated with the developed analytical methods. T-butanole, BHT, m-Xylene, o-Xylene, Ethylbenzene and silicone derivates were migrated compounds. With the help of statutory provisions the toxicological assessment didn`t show any health haz-ard neither for water nor for contrast medium as filling. For the assessment of migrated un-known substances the Kunststoffrichtlinie 2002 / 72 /EG was used. According to FDA using regulations from the food sector is possible. Concentrations of known leachables as well as the global migration limits, summarizing concentrations of known and unknown substances were not exceeded. The toxicological risk was estimated being harmless. For unknown sub-stances identification should be conducted to exclude any toxicological risk if a registration as primary packaging material is targeted. When comparing extractable and leachable profiles in many cases a similar screen was shown concerning known compounds. However a quantitative correlation couldnât be demonstrated. The reason was the use of different moulded articles. The different moulding processes caused an allocation of plastic additives in plastics and elastomers which wasnât comparable. Within the scope of this work screening methods to investigate plastics and elastomers con-cerning their extractable and leachable profiles has been developed successfully. It is possible to select materials already during the development process considering the potential of migra-tion of the used plastic additives. The following toxicological assessment allows an early de-cision about the suitability as primary packaging material. Caused by the multiplicity of plas-tic additives which are currently on the market and their possibility to create reaction products with the filling it is necessary to adapt or amend the developed methods...|$|R

The success of these materials is due to the high properties of coatings formed. These coatings have high adhesion, strength properties and corrosion resistance. The advanages of these materials is feed-stock availability, low cost compared to other polyurethanes, their usability. Uralkyd materials is one-component and low-toxicity system. So they are promising in the protection of various metal from corrosion. Uralkyd oligomers sufficiently versatile in use. They can be applied a lot of methods and combined with many types of paints (nitrocellulose, <b>chlorinated</b> <b>rubber</b> and oily alkyd oligomers). They can be used at the factory painting and refit painting of metal products...|$|E
40|$|Aluminium {{pigmented}} <b>chlorinated</b> <b>rubber</b> coatings, {{widely used}} for steel ship protection, can be bleached {{when exposed to}} total immersion conditions. A deep study {{on the development of}} the decolouration processes of these coatings, applied on rolled steel specimens exposed to total immersion conditions in aqueous solutions with different salinity, has been carried out. The relationship between external salinity and contamination by sodium chloride of the steel/coating interface in the bleaching processes has been analysed. Besides, the influence of the osmotic processes in the coating bleaching has been established. Periodic visual inspections of the coating films, together with a deep analysis of the coating microstructure, by means of optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy provided with microsonde analysis, were used. The bleaching processes of the coatings mainly depend on the salinity of the external solution, while the influence of the steel/coating interface contamination is not relevant. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|MEK {{is listed}} in Reprotext as a class A- for its {{potential}} to be a human reproductive hazard. 1 Evidence is principally based on animal evidence of developmental effects at high doses. 2 - 5 Some of the animal evidence for MEK comes from studies of 2 -butanol which is rapidly converted to MEK in mammals. EPAâs oral refence dose for MEK is based on developmental effects seen in a reproductive and developmental toxicity study of 2 -butanol in rats. 6 Human evidence of reproductive and developmental effects is limited and is not specific to MEK as workers were also exposed to other solvents. 1, 6 Exposure MEK is a solvent used in various coatings, adhesives, and inks. It is a solvent for nitrocellulose, lacquers, rubber cement, printing inks, paint removers, vinyl films, resins, rosins, polystyrene, <b>chlorinated</b> <b>rubber,</b> polyurethane, acrylic coatings, and cleaning solutions. 7 MEK was detected in a childrenâs slimy toy and in 3 out of 6 tents in testing by the Danish EPA. ...|$|E
