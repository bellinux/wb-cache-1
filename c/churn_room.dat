50|$|The {{southern}} end accommodates the receiving and despatch docks, main room, cream platform, <b>churn</b> <b>room,</b> chill and cold rooms, salt room, packing rooms, testing rooms {{and the office}} mezzanine. Concrete platforms, approximately 700mm above {{the level of the}} main room, run along the east, south and west sides and form the receiving and despatch docks. These docks service the former railway siding to the east and vehicle loading area to the south and west. The deck of the cream platform is formed by the concrete ceilings of the chill and cold stores, salt room, packing and other rooms below. A fibrous cement sheeted partition runs part the way down the west side and stout timber posts continue around the perimeter. The posts to the west side carry large metal brackets that supported the pulleys and belts once associated with the motors for the churns which stood on the floor below. The main room now accommodates machinery and equipment for the current oil pressing business. The chill/cold stores, salt room and packing rooms retain original features including hatches, doors and doorways, concrete upstands and floor drains.|$|E
