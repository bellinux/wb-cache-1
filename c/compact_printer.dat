5000|$|Synqera Loyalty Generator - a <b>compact</b> <b>printer</b> with {{integrated}} touch-screen and card-reader delivering customized shopping lists, {{recipes and}} store maps {{at the store}} entrance. The hardware part is developed by Star Micronics.|$|E
50|$|Jack Hall, {{an award-winning}} {{industrial}} designer, {{was chosen to}} work out the ergonomics, mechanics and overall appearance of the Gavilan. An extremely <b>compact</b> <b>printer</b> module {{was the result of a}} collaboration between Hall Design and C. Itoh of Japan. Additionally, several patentable features such as the unique display hinge and printer attachment mechanism were embodied in the design.|$|E
50|$|The Gavilan, however, {{was more}} {{affordable}} than the GRiD, at a list price of around US$4000. Unlike the GRiD, it {{was equipped with}} a floppy disk drive and used the MS-DOS operating system, although it was only partially IBM PC-compatible. Powered by a 5 MHz Intel 8088 processor, it was equipped with a basic graphical user interface, stored in its 48 kb of ROM. An internal 300-baud modem was standard. A <b>compact</b> <b>printer</b> that attached {{to the rear of}} the machine was an option.|$|E
50|$|Zink Imaging {{makes all}} the paper; makes a printer for {{printing}} labels and other designs on rolls of Zink zRoll; and licenses its technology to other companies that make <b>compact</b> photo <b>printers,</b> and combined camera / <b>compact</b> photo <b>printers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most <b>compact</b> photo <b>printers</b> share {{a similar}} design. They are small units, usually with large LCDs {{in order to}} allow people to browse and edit their photos, as can be done on a computer. The editing options are usually {{somewhat}} advanced, allowing the user to crop photos, remove red eye, adjust color settings as well as other functions. <b>Compact</b> photo <b>printers</b> typically feature a large number of connection options, including USB and most memory card formats.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Compact</b> photo <b>printers</b> came on {{the market}} shortly after the {{popularity}} of home photo printing took off in the early 2000s. They were designed {{as an alternative to}} developing photos or printing them on a standard inkjet photo printer. The majority of <b>compact</b> photo <b>printers</b> can only print 4" [...] x 6" [...] pictures. Given this limitation, they are not meant to replace standard inkjets. Many manufacturers advertise the cost per page of photos printed on their machines; this theoretically convinces people that they can print their own pictures just as cheaply as retail stores or through online printing services.|$|R
40|$|A generic <b>compact</b> <b>printer</b> and a {{corresponding}} parser are constructed. These programs transform values of any regular datatype {{to and from}} a bit stream. The algorithms are constructed along with a proof that printing followed by parsing is the identity. Since the binary representation is very compact the printer {{can be used for}} compressing data - possibly supplemented with some standard algorithm for compressing bit streams. The <b>compact</b> <b>printer</b> and the parser are described in the polytypic Haskell extension Poly...|$|E

The <b>compact</b> <b>printer</b> and the parser are described in the polytypic Haskell extension PolyP. 1 Introduction Many programs convert data from one format to another; examples are parsers, pretty printers, data compressors, encryptors, functions that communicate with a database, etc. Some of these programs, such as parsers and pretty printers, critically depend on the structure of the input data. Other programs, such as most data compressors and encryptors, more or less ignore the structure of the data. We claim that using the structure of the input data in a program [...] ...|$|E
5000|$|Zink (stylised as ZINK), a {{portmanteau}} of [...] "zero ink," [...] is a full-color {{printing system}} for digital devices {{that does not}} require ink cartridges and prints in a single pass. The printing technology and its thermal paper are developed by Zink Imaging, Inc., a US company. Zink Imaging makes all the paper; makes a printer for printing labels and other designs on rolls of Zink zRoll; and licenses its technology to other companies that make <b>compact</b> photo <b>printers,</b> and combined camera / <b>compact</b> photo <b>printers</b> that print photographs onto mostly 2×3” (about 5×8 cm) sheets of Zink Paper.|$|R
50|$|A <b>compact</b> photo <b>printer</b> is a {{stand-alone}} inkjet printer designed to produce 4×6 or 2×3 inch prints from digital cameras. It works {{without the use}} of a computer. It is also known as a portable photo printer or a snapshot printer.|$|R
50|$|<b>Compact</b> photo <b>printers</b> are {{currently}} manufactured {{by most of}} the leading printer manufacturers such as Epson, Canon, HP, Lexmark and Kodak. While they have increased in popularity in recent years, they still make up a relatively small share of the inkjet printer market.|$|R
5000|$|The other <b>compact</b> photo <b>printer</b> is Pocket Photo from LG {{which can}} print 600 dpi on 2"×3" [...] paper and support Android, iOS and Windows 8. The Pocket Photo uses Zink thermal paper which has {{chemistries}} imbedded on each inkless photo {{paper and the}} image will appear with the heat.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Polaroid {{developed}} the Zink [...] "zero-ink" [...] technology. [...] The paper {{is used in}} <b>compact</b> photo <b>printers.</b> It has several layers: a backing layer with optional pressure sensitive adhesive, heat-sensitive layers with cyan, magenta and yellow pigments in colorless form, and overcoat. Zink technology allows the printing of full-color images {{in a single pass}} without requiring ink cartridges.|$|R
50|$|Marking {{the third}} {{anniversary of the}} initial Kickstarter launch, Kudo3D {{launched}} their new printer once again on Kickstarter. Dubbed the Bean, this <b>compact</b> 3D <b>printer</b> was created to solve the consumer's desire for a high resolution, low cost 3D printer. The Bean was able to reach their goal of $50,000 within 2 minutes and $100,000 in 3 minutes. The Bean 3D printer is a LCD SLA 3D printer, meaning it uses a LCD to project images slices onto the resin container.|$|R
5000|$|As digital cameras, <b>compact</b> photo <b>printers,</b> {{and flat}} screen {{computer}} monitors became {{widely available in}} the early 2000s, people connected these together using a personal computer and software and created their own photo booths. Entrepreneurs began renting machines built along these lines at weddings and parties and the idea spread. From 2005 to 2012, interest in the United States for photo booth rentals grew significantly. By 2016 more people were searching for photo booth rentals than DJ rentals in 15 of North America's largest cities. Photo booth rentals have also become popular in other countries such as Canada, Australia, and the UK. So far in 2016 there is an average of 226,000 monthly searches for a photo booth globally, this has risen by 48.9% since 2015 (In the UK alone this is nearly 20,000 searches a month) ...|$|R

In the modern era such as this are now many tools that we have encountered using the laser. Equipment that uses laser components can be found everywhere, as readers of the code (barcode) price, laser <b>printers,</b> <b>compact</b> disc player, DVD player, Blueray, the jet plane, a tool with the laser eye surgery and laser shows in the music festival. The goal of making this tool {{is the use of}} lasers as a tool to display the characters. This tool displays the characters using only one laser. Modulation of laser rays is controlled by the microcontroller turned on and off that will form the dots on the screen. Ray laser reflected by rotating octagonal mirror. Octagonal mirror mounted on the dc motor. Laser display can show 80 characters...|$|R
40|$|A laser is {{a device}} that {{produces}} a coherent, intense, highly directional beam of light of a single wavelength or tunable over a band of wavelengths. These properties have made lasers highly useful tools for research and manufacturing. Lasers are found everywhere. <b>Printers,</b> <b>compact</b> disc players, bar scanners, laser pointers, and alignment lasers are commonly found at SLAC and {{are designed to be}} safe when used as intended. Also at SLAC, high-power, ultra-fast lasers are used in research and represent hazards that must be mitigated. This chapter describes these hazards and the methods used for their mitigation. 1. 1 Hazards / Impacts Laser hazards are related principally to the intensely powerful beam emitted, which can cause eye damage and skin burns. Related hazards include electrical currents, explosions, fires, toxic material, laser-generated air contaminants, collateral radiation, noise, and ultraviolet light. Information on these hazards can be found in related chapters of this manual. 1. 1. 1 Hazard Classifications Laser safety requirements are specified according to the classification of the laser (see Section 4, “Definitions”) based on The ability of the laser beam to cause injury to the eye or skin. For example, a Class 4 laser is capable of causing greater injury than a Class 1 laser. The level of the laser’s accessible radiation. For example, a Class 1 laser system can contain an embedded Class 4 laser. ...|$|R
