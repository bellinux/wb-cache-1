5|$|Booker assumed {{office as}} mayor of Newark on July 1, 2006. After his first week in office, he {{announced}} a 100-day plan to implement reforms in Newark. The proposed changes included increasing police forces, ending background <b>checks</b> <b>for</b> many city jobs to help former offenders find employment in the city, refurbishing police stations, improving city services, and expanding summer youth programs.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, a study {{published}} in the Lancet reported that state laws only requiring background checks or permits for gun sales at gun shows were associated with higher rates of gun-related deaths. The same study also found that state laws that required background <b>checks</b> <b>for</b> all gun sales were strongly associated with lower rates of gun-related deaths.|$|E

5|$|An {{infinite}} loop may occur if the exit {{conditions for the}} loop are not defined correctly. Once L exceeds R, the search has failed and must convey {{the failure of the}} search. In addition, the loop must be exited when the target element is found, {{or in the case of}} an implementation where this check is moved to the end, <b>checks</b> <b>for</b> whether the search was successful or failed at the end must be in place. Bentley found that, in his assignment of binary search, most of the programmers who implemented binary search incorrectly made an error defining the exit conditions.|$|E
5|$|Rialto paid Burton by monthly <b>checks</b> <b>for</b> {{the first}} four months. Burton {{received}} the first check on November 22. Burton indorsed and deposited the checks at Riggs National Bank in Washington, D.C., which in turn sent the checks to Rialto's bank, the Commonwealth Trust Company in St. Louis, Missouri, for payment. The last $500 was paid in cash to Burton in person, at Rialto's office in St. Louis, on March 26, 1903, after which Burton's representation of Rialto terminated.|$|E
5|$|In April 2012, the USDA {{received}} {{requests from}} beef processors to allow voluntary labeling of products with the additive, and stated it planned to approve labeling after <b>checks</b> <b>for</b> label accuracy. Both BPI and Cargill {{made plans to}} label products that contain the additive to alleviate these concerns and restore consumer confidence. Following the USDA announcement to allow choices in purchasing decisions for ground beef, many school districts stated that they would opt out of serving ground beef with LFTB. By June 2012, 47 out of 50 U.S. states declined to purchase any of the product for the 2012–2013 school year while South Dakota Department of Education, Nebraska, and Iowa chose to continue buying it.|$|E
50|$|This {{construction}} {{is analogous to}} the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Instead of <b>checking</b> <b>for</b> remainders of integers modulo prime numbers, we are <b>checking</b> <b>for</b> remainders of polynomials when divided by linears.|$|R

5|$|Microsoft Security Essentials is an {{antivirus}} software (AV) product that fights malicious software (malware), including computer viruses, spyware, Trojan horses and rootkits. It replaces Windows Live OneCare, a discontinued commercial subscription-based AV service, {{and the free}} Windows Defender, which until Windows 8 only protected users from adware and spyware. It automatically <b>checks</b> <b>for</b> and downloads the virus definitions it relies on from Microsoft Update, a web-based software service updated three times a day. Users may alternatively download the updates manually from the Microsoft Security Portal website. On 30 September 2011, a faulty definition update caused the product to incorrectly tag Google Chrome as malware. The issue was resolved within three hours. MSE originally ran on Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7, although versions 4.5 and later do not run on Windows XP and Microsoft stopped producing definition updates for Windows XP on 14 July 2015.|$|E
5|$|On September 20, {{two days}} after Hurricane Isabel passed the state, Governor Ruth Ann Minner made a formal request for a federal {{disaster}} declaration for the state. Later that day, President George W. Bush issued a federal disaster declaration for Delaware, one of twelve disaster declarations for the state. The declaration allowed {{for the use of}} federal disaster funds and emergency resources to help families and businesses recover from the effects of Hurricane Isabel. State and federal officials opened a disaster recovery center in Georgetown and Wilmington to assist individuals who suffered losses from Isabel and the remnants of Tropical Storm Henri just days before. 761people visited the recovery centers before they closed. One week after the disaster declaration, residents began receiving <b>checks</b> <b>for</b> those who applied for aid. By about two months after the passage of Hurricane Isabel, 659 residents applied for assistance, with slightly over $1million (2003USD, $1.1million 2006USD) being distributed to the victims. 141 loan applications were received, as well. FEMA distributed about $2.5million ($ USD) in Small Business Administration loans, and also received 183 public assistance loans for repair or replacement of public facilities.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} the model <b>checking</b> problem <b>for</b> probabilistic pushdown automata (pPDA) and properties expressible in various probabilistic logics. We start with properties {{that can be}} formulated as instances of a generalized random walk problem. We prove that both qualitative and quantitative model <b>checking</b> <b>for</b> this class of properties and pPDA is decidable. Then we show that model <b>checking</b> <b>for</b> the qualitative fragment of the logic PCTL and pPDA is also decidable. Moreover, we develop an error-tolerant model <b>checking</b> algorithm <b>for</b> PCTL and the subclass of stateless pPDA. Finally, we {{consider the}} class of ω-regular properties and show that both qualitative and quantitative model <b>checking</b> <b>for</b> pPDA is decidable. 1...|$|R

50|$|Diagnosis of aquagenic {{urticaria}} {{will begin}} with {{an evaluation of the}} patient's clinical history looking for any signs of what might be causing this severe reaction. The patient will then be put to a water treatment test where water will be applied to the upper body for 30 minutes. Water may be placed directly on the skin or a soaked paper towel may be applied. In many cases distilled water, tap water and saline will be used to <b>check</b> <b>for</b> a difference in reaction. After this is removed the skin will be <b>checked</b> <b>for</b> a reaction for the next 10-15 minutes. Because aqugenic urticaria frequently accompanies other types of physical urticaraia, the doctor may perform tests to <b>check</b> <b>for</b> these other conditions. An ice cube may be placed on the forearm for a few minutes to <b>check</b> <b>for</b> cold urticarial, exposure to a hot bath will be used to <b>check</b> <b>for</b> Cholinergis uticaria and the lesions will be inspected to determine the root cause of their appearance.|$|R
30|$|Considering the {{independent}} set problem as an example, the independence criterion {{does not need}} to be <b>checked</b> <b>for</b> every vertex because all vertices that have the same properties in this regard will have the same label. This is ensured by the design of the labeling function, which is described in the following section. Consequently, for a group of vertices with the same label, a <b>check</b> <b>for</b> independence requires only a single check rather than one <b>check</b> <b>for</b> each vertex in that group.|$|R
