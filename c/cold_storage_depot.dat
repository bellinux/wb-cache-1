The immense <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> <b>depot</b> which had just been completed at Manila was in need of cats. According to the Pittsburgh Chronicle Telegraph, the facility was to be supplied with cats developed about five or six years earlier at the Union Storage company. The Union Storage company was said to have experimented with various cat breeds to find cats suitable for living in the cold rooms. It had, according to the news story, tried a pair of high-bred cats, but they had sickened and died. Finally a pair of white felines without a pedigree were obtained and were first placed In the general storage room for a time; and then into a room where the temperature was gradually lowered until it was below the freezing point. When they were accustomed to the low temperature they were placed in the cold storage rooms where the temperature was never above 32 Fahrenheit (0 Celsius).|$|E

The goal {{of the study was to}} learn how to solve problems with the certification process and what opportunities certification offered to farmers. With this aim, the organizational structure of a cooperative which markets fresh fruit and vegetables was examined and fifty nine cooperative members were selected for interview by the purpose sampling method. All Fifty nine members were interviewed on subjects related to certification and the data were analyzed. The results of the study showed that the cooperative’s priorities were investment projects such as a <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> <b>depot</b> and a packaging line. Although the cooperative knew the benefits of the Good Agricultural Practices certificate, it was not a priority for them to establish a new unit to deal with the certification and to invest with this aim. Although the cooperative members ’ knowledge about certification is limited, in the situation where the cooperative makes efforts to obtain certification, farmers will support the management of the cooperative and will apply the principles and rules of the certification...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The present {{work is to}} {{investigate}} {{the effect of the}} different stacking arrangements on the performance of the <b>cold</b> <b>storage.</b> To analyze performance of the <b>cold</b> <b>storage,</b> an experiment is carried out in which the temperature distribution within the <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> and power consumption in the different stacking arrangement are kept under observation. The temperature inside the chamber is a crucial parameter on which whole performance of <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> depends. Various arrangement of stacking is accomplished by the changing the gap between the columns of stack. The experiment is carried out for the three arrangements with gap between the columns of stack of 10 cm, 20 cm and 30 cm. For better temperature distribution within the <b>cold</b> <b>storage,</b> good air circulation inside the <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> is desirable. And it is also done by the changing arrangement of stacking. Therefore, the optimization of temperature within the <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> is carried out in different stacking arrangement and resulting in improving the performance of <b>cold</b> <b>storage...</b>|$|R

To prevent premature decay of perishable products. 2. To lengthen the period of consumption and thus greatly increase production. 3. To enable the owner to market his products at will. 4.

40|$|International audienceStorage at low {{temperature}} {{is a valuable}} method for increasing the shelf-life of natural enemies such as insect parasitoids. <b>Cold</b> <b>storage</b> is usually performed under sub-optimal temperatures, and therefore it is generally associated with major fitness costs. Tolerance to <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> is a very plastic trait influenced by {{a wide range of}} endogenous (biotic) and exogenous (abiotic) factors experienced before, during, or after cold exposure. In fact, every hierarchical level from inter-species to inter-individuals shows a high plasticity in the response to cold exposure. Mortality represents the ultimate level of a range of sub-lethal perturbations accumulating during chilling. Even if individuals remain alive after <b>cold</b> <b>storage,</b> a reduction of several fitness-related traits may be observed directly, later in development or even in the next generation. The present review focuses on <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> of insect parasitoids. We first consider the genotypic-based plasticity in <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> tolerance and the complex network of endogenous and exogenous factors affecting the phenotypic plasticity in <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> tolerance. We also summarize and examine the wealth of fitness-related traits affected by <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> in parasitoids.

40|$|Warm {{ischemia}} (WI) {{produces a}} significant deleterious effect in potential kidney grafts. Hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) seems to improve immediate graft function after transplant. Our {{aim was to}} analyze the effect of short pretransplant periods of pulsatile HMP on histology and renal injury in warm-ischemic kidneys. Twelve minipigs were used. WI was achieved in the right kidney by applying a vascular clamp for 45 [*]min. After nephrectomy, autotransplant was performed following one of two strategies: <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> of the kidneys or <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> combined with perfusion in pulsatile HMP. The graft was removed early to study renal morphology, inflammation (fibrosis), and apoptosis. Proinflammatory activity and fibrosis were less pronounced after <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> of the kidneys with HMP than after <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> only. The use of HMP also decreased apoptosis compared with <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> only.

40|$|In recent years, the {{application}} of a centralized air-conditioning system (CACS) with <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> refrigeration in high-rise residential buildings has gradually increased.
