Specially designed in USML proposal These comments on “specially designed ” should not be interpreted as abandoning recommendations re the November 28 State rule to remove from <b>Category</b> <b>XI</b> many other ambiguous words and phrases. The July 25 proposal retains “specially designed ” in 20 of the 22 USML sub-items in which it appeared in the November 28 proposal and adds four more. The July 25 proposal omits the November 28 proposed sub-item XI(a) (12) entirely. The July 25 omission of “specially designed ” from XI(c) (1) was not accompanied by my recommendation, repeated now, {{to add to the}} control of application specific integrated circuits that the functionality is “a characteristic in the text of a U. S. Munitions List description of a controlled defense article. ” Without that addition, the specific application could concern a trivial functionality having no connection to the reason for the control of the defense article.

A <b>category</b> <b>xis</b> called an A-topos {{if there is}} a site (ϱ, τ), i. e. a small category ϱ together with a Grothendieck topology τ such that xis equivalent to the category Shτ[C 0. A] of τ-sheaves on C with values in C. If xis an C-topos, then so is Shτ'[ϱ 0, x] for any site (ϱ', τ'). It is shown that if for every site (ϱ,τ) the associated sheaf functor from presheaves to τ-sheaves with values in A exists (and preserves finite inverse limits), then the same holds if Ais replaced by any A-topos x. Roughly speaking, the main result is that for a site (ϱ,τ) the associated sheaf functor [ϱ 0, A] → Shτ [ϱ 0, A] exists and preserves finite inverse limits, provided A has filtered direct limits which commute with finite inverse limits, e. g. if A is a Grothendieck category or {{a category}} of sheaves with values in a locally finitely presentable category [8. 7. 1]. Analogous results hold in the additive case...|$|R

40|$|Let G be {{a compact}} Lie group. What is the {{appropriate}} generalization of singular cohomology to the <b>category</b> of G-spaces <b>XI</b> The simplest choice is the ordinary cohomology of EG xG X, where EG is the total space of a universal principal G-bundle. This Borel cohomology [1] is readily computable and has many applications, but is clearly inadequate for such basic parts of G-homotopy theory as obstruction theory. Another choice is Bredon cohomology [2], as generalized from finite to compact Lie groups by several authors. This gives groups HQ(X;M) for n> 0 and for a "coefficient system " M. Here M is a contravariant functor from the homotopy category of orbit spaces G/H and G-maps to the category Ab of Abelian groups. (Subgroups are understood to be closed.) Bredon cohomology is adequate for obstruction theory. For finite G, Triantafillou has used it to algebraicize rational G-homotopy theory [11], and she and two of us have used it {{to set up the}} foundations of the theory of localization of G-spaces for general G [8]. When M is constant at an Abelian group A, written M = A, we have (*) H"G(X;A) = H n (X/G;A). In particular, we have H...|$|R

The independent variables are: (a) knowledge of the environment (X 1), the attitude towards the environment (X 2), and the motivation to maintain an environment (X 3). The dependent variable is {{the behavior}} of the environmental maintenance (Y). The study location is in the Walenae watershed namely Soppeng, Wajo, and Bone District. The research areas selected by purposive sampling consist of one village of each district near the Walenae watershed. A total of 200 households as respondents which were selected by systematic random sampling of the three sample areas. Data were analized by descriptive and inferential statistical. Inferential analysis are a simple and multiple regression. The results showed that all of variables are in moderate <b>category.</b> Environmental knowledge (<b>XI),</b> the attitude towards the environment (X 2), and the motivation to maintain an environment (X 3) give the positive effect and significant contribution either individually or simultaneously on the people's behavior to maintain the environment (Y) in the Walenae watershed of South Sulawesi Provinc...|$|R
