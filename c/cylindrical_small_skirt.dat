2500|$|Another major {{pioneering}} {{effort of}} the early hovercraft era {{was carried out by}} Jean Bertin's firm in France. Bertin was an advocate of the [...] "multi-skirt" [...] approach, which used a number of <b>smaller</b> <b>cylindrical</b> <b>skirts</b> instead of one large one {{in order to avoid the}} problems noted above. During the early 1960s he developed a series of prototype designs, which he called [...] "terraplanes" [...] if they were aimed for land use, and [...] "naviplanes" [...] for water. The best known of these designs was the N500 Naviplane, built for Seaspeed by the Société d'Etude et de Développement des Aéroglisseurs Marins (SEDAM). The N500 could carry 400 passengers, 55 cars and five buses. It set a speed record between Boulogne and Dover of [...] It was rejected by its operators, who claimed that it was unreliable.|$|R

5000|$|The {{engine was}} {{strengthened}} {{in a few}} areas and the cam duration was increased. The pistons were lighter with a <b>smaller</b> <b>skirt</b> area. 510 cc injectors were replaced with 560 cc injectors for better engine reliability due to more electrical [...] "headroom" [...] and the ECU was changed to include a flash ROM, allowing more boost pressure to the same TD05-HR as the Mitsubishi Evolution IV.|$|R

50|$|Foster {{is a small}} lunar crater {{that lies}} to the {{southeast}} of the larger crater Joule, {{on the far side}} of the Moon. The rim of Foster is slightly eroded, and the narrow inner walls slope directly down to the relatively dark interior floor. The rim has a small outward bulge along the southwest side. There is a small craterlet on the floor next to the northern rim.

5000|$|There {{are several}} {{variants}} {{of the ski}} cap, starting with the 's ski cap. This {{was the first in}} the family of caps, and was recognized by a high peak, a teardrop shaped top, a short bill, and a <b>small</b> <b>skirt</b> that folds down to protect the ears in cold. All [...] had a small edelweiss or a grouping of [...] leaves, depending on the unit. During the Second World War, the ski cap was generally made of field grey or field blue wool, depending on whether it was used by the Heer, SS, or the Luftwaffe.|$|R

5000|$|Neo-Taíno sexual {{freedom is}} well {{documented}} by such as Bartolomé de las Casas, Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés and Amerigo Vespucci. Father de las Casas writes: [...] "The Indian women of Cuba, as once did women of many places, went naked. Married women wore a <b>small</b> <b>skirt</b> or apron, called an enagua, which did not cover their breasts and rarely reached the knee. These women in the marriage ceremony, took to the marriage chamber all {{the friends of the}} husband, and later emerged to the cry Manikato, the cry of victory." [...] (Father Bartolomé de la Casas, circa 1500). Yet there are some who question this in a debate recalling the old controversies surrounding Margaret Mead.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Small</b> <b>cylindrical</b> object {{navigating}} near free-surface {{is subject}} to wave disturbance. Wave disturbance can dramatically influence the depth control of the near-surface navigating object. A self-regulating fuzzy depth control method is proposed to keep the <b>small</b> <b>cylindrical</b> object navigate at the expected depth under free-surface disturbance. The near-surface dynamic model of the cylindrical object is presented and the fuzzy depth control method is modeled. The results obtained {{by a series of}} hardware-in-loop simulations demonstrate that the self-tuning fuzzy depth control method is valid to keep the <b>small</b> <b>cylindrical</b> object navigate steadily in the expected depth under free-surface disturbances...|$|R

5000|$|Columbus {{thought the}} Lucayans resembled the Guanche of the Canary Islands (in {{part because they}} were {{intermediate}} in skin color between Europeans and Africans). The Lucayans were described as handsome, graceful, well-proportioned, gentle, generous and peaceful, and customarily going almost completely naked. Peter Martyr d'Anghiera said that the Lucayan women were so beautiful that men from [...] "other countries" [...] moved to the islands to be near them. Women past puberty wore a <b>small</b> <b>skirt</b> of cotton, and the men might wear a loincloth made of plaited leaves or cotton. Some people wore head bands, waist bands, feathers, bones and ear and nose jewelry on occasion. They were often tattooed and usually applied paint to their bodies and/or faces. They also practiced head flattening. Their hair was black and straight, and they kept it cut short {{except for a few}} hairs in back which were never cut. Columbus reported seeing scars on the bodies of some of the men, which were explained to him as resulting from attempts by men from other islands to capture them.|$|R

2500|$|Dry ice is {{typically}} produced in three standard forms: large blocks, <b>cylindrical</b> <b>small</b> (5/8 or 1/2 inch diameter) pellets and cylindrical tiny (1/8 inch diameter), high surface to volume pellets that float on oil or water {{and do not}} stick to skin because of their high radii of curvature. Tiny dry ice pellets are used primarily for ice blasting, quick freezing, fire fighting, oil solidifying and {{have been found to}} be safe for experimentation by middle school students wearing appropriate Personal Protective Equipment such as gloves and safety glasses. A standard block weighing approximately 30kg covered in a taped paper wrapping is most common. These are commonly used in shipping, because they sublime relatively slowly due to a low ratio of surface area to volume. Pellets are around [...] in diameter and can be bagged easily. This form is suited to small scale use, for example at grocery stores and laboratories where it is stored in a thickly insulated chest.|$|R
