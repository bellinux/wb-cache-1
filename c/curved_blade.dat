25|$|Other common blade {{patterns}} {{include the}} circle pattern or curved pattern and the hawk's-bill pattern. Circle pattern snips have a <b>curved</b> <b>blade</b> {{and are used}} to cut circles. Hawk's-bill snips are used to cut small radii {{on the inside and}} outside of a circle. The shape of the blades allow for sharp turns without buckling the sheet metal. A common use is cutting holes in pipes.|$|E
25|$|These rites {{often include}} a special set of magical tools. These usually include a knife called an athame, a wand, a pentacle and a chalice, but other tools include a broomstick {{known as a}} besom, a cauldron, candles, incense and a <b>curved</b> <b>blade</b> known as a boline. An altar is usually present in the circle, on which ritual tools are placed and {{representations}} of the God and the Goddess may be displayed. Before entering the circle, some traditions fast for the day, and/or ritually bathe. After a ritual has finished, the God, Goddess and Guardians are thanked, the directions are dismissed and the circle is closed.|$|E
50|$|Though <b>curved</b> <b>blades</b> are {{as old as}} {{the sword}} itself, they did not become {{widespread}} in Asia and the Middle East until after the dominance of the Mongol Empire. Japanese warriors of the Kamakura Shogunate experienced the effectiveness and lethality of <b>curved</b> <b>blades</b> firsthand during the Mongol invasions of Japan. Rudimentary forms what would eventually become the tachi gradually began to eclipse the chokutō in popularity as the <b>curved</b> <b>blades</b> demonstrated greater ease of handling and lethality in mounted combat.|$|R

500|$|Richard's mark stood {{untouched}} for 16 seasons until Bernie Geoffrion {{became the}} second player to score 50 goals in , also for Montreal, {{doing so in}} his 62nd {{game of the season}} (and the Canadiens' 68th). Early in the 1960s, Chicago Black Hawks teammates Stan Mikita and Bobby Hull began experimenting with curved blades, noticing that different bends made shots more unpredictable for goaltenders. Mikita led the NHL in scoring four times using a <b>curved</b> <b>blade,</b> while Hull became the third player in NHL history to score 50 goals in [...] It was the first of five times he would reach the milestone.|$|E
500|$|In 1943, {{to make it}} more entertaining, {{the rules}} {{committee}} looked to increase the game's speed. [...] Rangers coach Frank Boucher proposed the neutral zone divided by a centre red line, so teams could pass the puck out of the defensive zone into their half of the neutral zone. [...] Previously, the league required defensive players carry the puck from the defensive zone, not permitting a pass across the blue line. [...] Introduced in 1943–44, the new rule changed the game. [...] Formerly, strong fore-checking pinned opponents in their own zone for minutes at a time; subsequently, teams rushed up the ice with defencemen passing to forwards beyond the blue line. [...] Scoring increased 10% league-wide; four of six teams topped 200 goals, the first time teams did so. In the early 1960s, Stan Mikita inadvertently introduced the <b>curved</b> <b>blade</b> to a hockey stick. [...] Cracking his blade during a practice and not wanting to retrieve another, Mikita shot the puck in anger. He noticed the curve in the cracked blade caused the puck to behave differently. Both Mikita and Bobby Hull experimented with heating and bending their stick blade to create different curves. [...] Using a <b>curved</b> <b>blade,</b> Mikita went on to win four Art Ross Trophies as the NHL's leading scorer. [...] He later said he regretted the idea: [...] "It's one of the worst inventions in hockey, because it eliminated the use of the backhand." ...|$|E

The advantages of variable pitch are: high starting torque; a wide, relatively flat torque curve; [...] a higher coefficient of performance; more efficient operation in turbulent winds; and a lower blade speed ratio which lowers blade bending stresses. Straight, V, or <b>curved</b> <b>blades</b> may be used.|$|R

2500|$|The saber (sabre) {{and similar}} blades {{such as the}} cutlass were built more heavily and were more {{typically}} used in warfare. Built for slashing and chopping at multiple enemies, often [...] from horseback, the saber's long <b>curved</b> <b>blade</b> and slightly forward weight balance gave it a deadly character all its own on the battlefield. Most sabers also had sharp points and double edged blades, making them capable of piercing soldier after soldier in a cavalry charge.

The US Navy kept {{tens of thousands of}} sturdy cutlasses in their armory well into World War II and many were issued to marines in the Pacific as jungle machetes.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1858–59, a skating pond opened in New York's Central Park, re-igniting {{interest}} in the activity. Sex segregation at ponds disappeared early on and skating became [...] "one of the only activities that single men and women could do together unchaperoned." [...] Additional skating ponds opened in Brooklyn, Hoboken, Jersey City, and Staten Island as the activity grew in popularity. The Skating Club of New York was founded in 1863. Jackson Haines, an American, was the first skater to incorporate ballet and dance movements into his skating, as opposed to focusing on tracing patterns on the ice. He also invented the sit spin and developed a shorter, <b>curved</b> <b>blade</b> for figure skating that allowed for easier turns. Haines {{was also the first}} to wear blades that were permanently attached to the boot. He won the first Championships of America held in Troy, New York in 1864.|$|E
2500|$|As of April 2008, the British {{government}} added swords with a <b>curved</b> <b>blade</b> of 50cm (20in) or over {{in length}} ("the {{length of the}} blade shall be the straight line distance {{from the top of}} the handle to the tip of the blade") to the Offensive Weapons Order. [...] This ban was a response to reports that samurai swords were used in more than 80 attacks and four killings over the preceding four years. Those who violate the ban would be jailed up to six months and charged a fine of £5,000. Martial arts practitioners, historical re-enactors and others may still own such swords. The sword can also be legal provided it was made in Japan before 1954, or was made using traditional sword making methods. It is also legal to buy if it can be classed as a [...] "martial artist's weapon". This ban applies to England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. This ban was amended in August 2008 to allow sale and ownership without licence of [...] "traditional" [...] hand-forged katana.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} to use a straight or <b>curved</b> laryngoscope <b>blade</b> depends partly on the specific anatomical features of the airway, and partly on the personal experience and preference of the laryngoscopist. The Macintosh blade is {{the most widely used}} <b>curved</b> laryngoscope <b>blade,</b> while the Miller blade is the most popular style of straight blade. Both Miller and Macintosh laryngoscope blades are available in sizes 0 (infant) through 4 (large adult). There are many other styles of straight and <b>curved</b> <b>blades,</b> with accessories such as mirrors for enlarging the field of view and even ports for the administration of oxygen. These specialty blades are primarily designed for use by anesthetists and otolaryngologists, most commonly in the operating room.|$|R
40|$|Small-scale {{hydroelectric}} power generation has recently attracted considerable attention. The authors previously proposed an undershot cross-flow water turbine {{with a very}} low head suitable for application to open channels. The water turbine was of a cross-flow type and {{could be used in}} open channels with the undershot method, remarkably simplifying its design by eliminating guide vanes and the casing. The water turbine was fitted with <b>curved</b> <b>blades</b> (such as the runners of a typical cross-flow water turbine) installed in tube channels. However, there was ambiguity as to how the blades’ shape influenced the turbine’s performance and flow field. To resolve this issue, the present study applies straight blades to an undershot cross-flow water turbine and examines the performance and flow field via experiments and numerical analyses. Results reveal that the output power and the turbine efficiency of the Straight Blades runner were greater than those of the <b>Curved</b> <b>Blades</b> runner regardless of the rotational speed. Compared with the <b>Curved</b> <b>Blades</b> runner, the output power and the turbine efficiency of the Straight Blades runner were improved by about 31. 7 % and about 67. 1 %, respectively...|$|R
60|$|In the {{meantime}} the girl moved about the room, keeping {{out of the}} way of the duelists, and as she did so, Bradley caught a glimpse of her full face and immediately recognized her as the girl of the place of the yellow door. He did not dare intervene now until one of the Wieroo had overcome the other, lest the two should turn upon him at once, when the chances were fair that he would be defeated in so unequal a battle as the <b>curved</b> <b>blade</b> of the red Wieroo would render it, and so he waited, watching the white-robed figure slowly choking the life from him of the red robe. The protruding tongue and the popping eyes proclaimed that the end was near and a moment later the red robe sank to the floor of the room, the <b>curved</b> <b>blade</b> slipping from nerveless fingers. For an instant longer the victor clung to the throat of his defeated antagonist and then he rose, dragging the body after him, and approached the central column. Here he raised the body and thrust it into the aperture where Bradley saw it drop suddenly from sight. Instantly there flashed into his memory the circular openings in the roof of the river vault and the corpses he had seen drop from them to the water beneath.|$|E
