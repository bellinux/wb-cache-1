50|$|Various {{neurodegenerative}} diseases {{have been}} associated with excessive NMDA receptor activation meant to mediate calcium dependent neurotoxicity. Researchers have examined many different NMDA antagonists and their therapeutic efficacy, none of which have concluded to be both safe and effective. For years, researchers have been investigating the effects of an open <b>channel</b> <b>block,</b> memantine, as a treatment option for neurotoxicity. They hypothesized that the faster blocking and unblocking rates, and overall kinetics, of memantine could be the underlying reason for the clinical tolerance. As an uncompetitive antagonist, memantine should bring NMDA levels close to normal despite high glutamate concentration. Based on this information, researchers speculated that some day memantine could be used as an open <b>channel</b> <b>block</b> to prevent increasing glutamate levels associated with neurotoxicity with little to no side effects compared to other treatment options.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Lamotrigine is a sodium <b>channel</b> <b>blocking</b> {{agent that}} is widely {{prescribed}} {{for treatment of}} seizure. Although life-threatening effects are rarely observed in overdose, some previous reports have described the occurrence of cardiac toxicity. The management of sodium <b>channel</b> <b>blocking</b> agent-induced cardiotoxicity conventionally requires sodium bicarbonate administration. Recent case reports describe intravenous lipid administration as a successful treatment for refractory cardiovascular collapse induced by sodium <b>channel</b> <b>blocking</b> medications. OBJECTIVE: The objective {{of this study is}} to report the use of intravenous lipid emulsion as adjunctive therapy in a case of lamotrigine overdose in which electrocardiographic changes were unresponsive to bicarbonate therapy. CASE REPORT: We report a case of intentional lamotrigine overdose in a 50 -year-old woman who lost consciousness and developed electrocardiographic aberrations, including widening of QRS with occurrence of left bundle branch block. The patient was initially treated with sodium bicarbonate without effect. Recovery of cardiac conduction was rapidly achieved after infusion of a 20 % lipid emulsion. The exact mechanism of action of lipid emulsion is not fully understood. The lipophilic properties of lamotrigine suggest that it was partially removed by the plasmatic lipid emulsion. CONCLUSION: This case provides additional insight into the potential benefit of using lipid emulsion in refractory sodium <b>channel</b> <b>blocking</b> intoxications...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} various sodium <b>channel</b> <b>blocking</b> agents on acute thermal and {{mechanical}} nociception, as assessed using the plantar and tail pressure tests, respectively, {{were compared with}} the effects of morphine. The drugs used were mexiletine, lidocaine, carbamazepine, phenytoin, eperisone, tolperisone, and zonisamide. The sodium <b>channel</b> <b>blocking</b> agents exhibited a rather preferential elevation of the threshold for thermal nociception. By contrast, morphine produced similar analgesic effects on thermal and mechanical nociception. In the sciatic nerve isolated from mice, mexiletine, lidocaine, eperisone, and tolperisone impaired the propagation of low frequency action potentials (evoked at 0. 2 Hz). Carbamazepine, phenytoin, and zonisamide generated a more frequency-dependent local anesthetic action with their obvious effects on higher frequency action potentials (evoked at 5 and/or 10 Hz). Our results show that sodium <b>channel</b> <b>blocking</b> agents have a preferential antinociceptive action against thermal stimulation that is likely to be attributed to their local anesthetic action...|$|R

5000|$|Tools such as X-ray {{crystallography}} and electrophysiology {{have been}} essential in locating the binding sites of open <b>channel</b> <b>block</b> molecules. By studying {{the biological and}} chemical makeup of ion channels, researchers can determine {{the makeup of the}} molecules that bind to certain regions. X-ray crystallography provides a structural image of the channel and molecule in question. Determining the hydrophobicity of channel domains through hydrophobicity plots also provides clues to the chemical makeup of the molecule and why it binds to a certain region. For example, if a protein binds to a hydrophobic region of the channel (and therefore, has a transmembrane region), the molecule in question might be composed of the amino acids alanine, leucine, or phenylalanine, as they are all hydrophobic themselves. Electrophysiology is also an important tool in identifying channel structure, as analyzing the ionic factors that lead to channel activation can be critical to understanding the inhibiting actions of open <b>channel</b> <b>block</b> molecules.|$|E

40|$|Objective(s) : The structure- {{activity}} {{relationship of}} a series of 36 molecules, showing L-type calcium <b>channel</b> <b>blocking</b> was studied using a QSAR (quantitative structureâ€“activity relationship) method. Materials and Methods: Structures were optimized by the semi-empirical AM 1 quantum-chemical method which was also used to find structure-calcium <b>channel</b> <b>blocking</b> activity trends. Several types of descriptors, including electrotopological, structural and thermodynamics were used to derive a quantitative relationship between L-type calcium <b>channel</b> <b>blocking</b> activity and structural properties.

Results:Multiple linear regressions (MLR) was employed to model the relationships between molecular descriptors and biological activities of molecules using stepwise method and genetic algorithm as variable selection tools. The accuracy of the proposed MLR model was illustrated using cross-validation, and Y-randomisation -as the evaluation techniques.

In the renal transplant population, a role for calcium channel blockers in allograft protection and in prevention of sepsis has been postulated. We hypothesized that any important survival benefit or risk related to chronic use of calcium <b>channel</b> <b>blocking</b> agents should be discernable through an analysis of a large database of stable recipients of renal allografts who had enrolled in a large international trial. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 4, 110 renal transplant recipients who enrolled in the international Folic Acid for Vascular Outcome Reduction in Transplantation trial between 2002 and 2007 and were followed until 2010 was undertaken comparing cohorts (FAVORIT) of patients either taking (n= 1, 436) or not taking (n= 2, 674) calcium <b>channel</b> <b>blocking</b> medications. The endpoint was all-cause mortality (cardiovascular, noncardiovascular mortality, or unknown). Results were adjusted for country, age, race, sex, smoker, systolic blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, low-density lipoprotein, and chronic kidney disease status. Results: There were no statistically significant differences in incidence rates of cardiovascular, noncardiovascular, and all-cause mortality between patients taking or not taking calcium <b>channel</b> <b>blocking</b> medications. Conclusion: Although physiologic reasoning and small series results suggest a benefit for calcium <b>channel</b> <b>blocking</b> agents for allograft protection and sepsis prevention in immunosuppressed patients, we find no clear survival benefit in a large international renal transplant trial.
