Information technologies (IT) formative teachers in the primary schools, and academicians in the faculties of education were interviewed to investigate the process and results of implementing <b>computer-aided</b> <b>instruction</b> methods whose basis is strengthened in theory. Analysis of the results gained from two separate surveys demonstrated that capability of the teachers in elementary education institutions for carrying into effect <b>computer-aided</b> <b>instruction</b> and technical infrastructure has not been established for <b>computer-aided</b> <b>instruction</b> practices yet. Prospective teachers must be well-equipped in ICT to duly fulfill requirements of modern education and also must be self-confident.

40|$|<b>Computer-Aided</b> <b>Instruction</b> (<b>CAI)</b> is {{a mature}} {{technology}} {{used to teach}} students {{in a wide variety}} of domains. The introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology of the field of CAI has prompted research and development efforts in an area known as Intelligent Computer-Aided Instruction (ICAI). In some cases, ICAI has been touted as a revolutionary alternative to traditional CAI. With the advent of powerful, inexpensive school computers, ICAI is emerging as a potential rival to CAI. In contrast to this, one may conceive of Computer-Based Training (CBT) systems as lying along a continuum which runs from CAI to ICAI. Although the key difference between the two is intelligence, there is not commonly accepted definition of what constitutes an intelligent instructional system...|$|E

40|$|The cost of {{alternative}} communications networks for {{the dissemination of}} PLATO IV <b>computer-aided</b> <b>instruction</b> (<b>CAI)</b> was studied. Four communication techniques are compared: leased telephone lines, satellite communication, UHF TV, and low-power microwave radio.

These costs are derived as functions of student population density, a parameter which can be calculated from census data for one potential market for CAI, the public primary and secondary schools. Calculating costs in this way allows one to determine which of the four communications alternatives can serve this market least expensively for any given area in the U. S.
