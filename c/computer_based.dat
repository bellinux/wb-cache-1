25|$|While Intel {{created the}} first commercially {{available}} microprocessor (Intel 4004) in 1971 {{and one of the}} first microcomputers in 1972, by the early 1980s its business was dominated by dynamic random-access memory chips. However, increased competition from Japanese semiconductor manufacturers had, by 1983, dramatically reduced the profitability of this market. The growing success of the IBM personal <b>computer,</b> <b>based</b> on an Intel microprocessor, was among factors that convinced Gordon Moore (CEO since 1975) to shift the company's focus to microprocessors and to change fundamental aspects of that business model. Moore's decision to sole-source Intel's 386 chip played into the company's continuing success.|$|E

At the present time, <b>computer</b> <b>based</b> software is dominated by big companies that offer their services to a worldwide public, such as Google Maps, Bing Maps, National Geographic maps, ESRI Geographic Information System (GIS), CartoDB, Mapbox, etc. Many other state-based, regional and smaller initiatives and companies offer their services. The list of online map services is quite long and is growing everyday.|$|E
25|$|Many {{remediation}} {{strategies have}} not taken into account that people with autism suffer from difficulties in learning social rules from examples. Computer-assisted autism therapy has been proposed to teach not simply via examples but to teach the rule along with it. A reasoning rehabilitation strategy, based on playing with a <b>computer</b> <b>based</b> mental simulator {{that is capable of}} modeling mental and emotional states of the real world, has been subject to short-term and long-term evaluations. The simulator performs the reasoning in the framework of belief-desire-intention model. Learning starts from the basic concepts of knowledge and intention and proceeds to more complex communicative actions such as explaining, agreeing, and pretending.|$|E

25|$|The {{examination}} is of 3 hours duration, {{and contains}} {{a total of}} 65 questions worth a maximum of 100 marks. From 2014 onward, the examination for all the papers is carried out in an online <b>Computer</b> <b>Based</b> Test (CBT) mode where the candidates are shown the questions in a random sequence on a computer screen. The questions consist of both multiple choice questions (four answer options out of which the correct {{one has to be}} chosen) and numerical answer type questions (answer is a real number, to be entered via an on-screen keypad and computer mouse). Candidates are provided with scribble pads for rough work and these have to be returned after the examination. At the end of the 3-hour window, the computer automatically closes the screen from further actions.|$|E
25|$|In humanâ€“{{computer}} interaction, computer accessibility (also {{known as}} accessible computing) {{refers to the}} accessibility of a computer system to all people, regardless of disability or severity of impairment, examples include web accessibility guidelines. Another approach is for the user to present a token to the computer terminal, such as a smart card, that has configuration information to adjust the computer speed, text size, etc. to their particular needs. This is useful where users want to access public <b>computer</b> <b>based</b> terminals in Libraries, ATM, Information kiosks etc. The concept is encompassed by the CEN EN 1332-4 Identification Card Systems - Man-Machine Interface. This development of this standard has been supported in Europe by SNAPI and has been successfully incorporated into the Lasseo specifications, but with limited success {{due to the lack}} of interest from public computer terminal suppliers.|$|E
