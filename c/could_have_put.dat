5|$|The Art Nouveau Chadderton Baths was {{a public}} {{swimming}} facility opened in 1937. Henry Taylor, the British Olympic freestyle swimming triple gold medallist and champion was an attendant at Chadderton Baths where many of his awards were displayed. Chadderton Baths were closed indefinitely in 2006 after a structural survey found faults which <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> the public at risk. Chadderton Sports Centre, built onto the Baths, was closed and replaced by the Chadderton Wellbeing Centre in January 2010. An application to demolish the Baths was made in March 2011, but is now in private ownership with conversion work due soon. The Wellbeing Centre is a multi-purpose facility with a swimming pool, dance studio, library, gym, meeting rooms, and café.|$|E

25|$|Von Braun's {{insistence on}} further tests after Mercury-Redstone 2 flew higher than planned has been {{identified}} as contributing to the Soviet Union's success in launching the first human in space. The Mercury-Redstone BD flight was successful, but took up the launch slot that <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> Alan Shepard into space three weeks ahead of Yuri Gagarin. His Soviet counterpart Sergei Korolev insisted on two successful flights with dogs before risking Gagarin's life on a manned attempt. The second test flight took place one day after the Mercury-Redstone BD mission.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, Tyrone {{reached their}} very first All-Ireland Final. However, {{they were the}} rank outsiders to beat Kerry, who were going for their third title in a row (and eighth in twelve years). At one stage in the second half, Tyrone had amassed a seven-point lead (a penalty that <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> them nine points ahead was struck over the bar by Kevin McCabe), but two of their leading players on the day, Eugene McKenna, and John Lynch had to be {{replaced}} due to injury, {{and the experience of}} Kerry shone through, going on to win by 2–15 to 1–10 (21 points to 13).|$|E
25|$|After the {{disappointment}} of losing to North Melbourne in the 1977 Preliminary Final, the Hawks were back {{to play in}} the 1978 Grand Final, again against North Melbourne. It was the third time in four seasons that these two sides were to meet in a grand final. North Melbourne were competing in their fifth successive grand final and were the reigning premiers. At half-time North Melbourne led by four points but Hawthorn finished victors by three goals thanks largely to a strong third quarter which saw them kick 7.6. The turning point occurred when two North players spoiled each other in the goalsquare at the 6-minute mark, when a mark and a goal <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> them 17 points up. The Hawks went on to dominate play after this incident and never looked back.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{concerns}} over legal issues WCW refrained from having Awesome appear on their television shows with the ECW belt. Eventually, a compromise was reached. Awesome (a WCW employee and ECW champion) appeared {{a few days}} later at an ECW event in Indianapolis, Indiana, accompanied by WCW's head of security, where he lost the title to Tazz (a World Wrestling Federation employee), who lost it a week later to Tommy Dreamer (a full-time ECW wrestler) (who incidentally lost it approximately 20 minutes later to Justin Credible). In the extreme shoot interview released by Highspots in 2005, Awesome expressed that he would have rather faced off with his former ECW and WWE colleague, Rhyno and suggested that they <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> on a more entertaining match regardless of the circumstances {{and the manner in which}} he had left ECW.|$|E
500|$|According to Kimmelman, {{the reason}} for their {{reluctance}} to produce the detailed photos, which <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> to rest the worst fears {{of many of the}} interested parties, was the intention of the company to produce a large limited-edition two-volume coffee-table book ("as large as a coffee table"). This book, when produced retailed for US$1,000. Kimmelman refers to the fact that these photos were only made available to the few who could afford the exorbitant price as [...] "ungenerous" [...] and [...] "immoral".|$|E
500|$|In 2014 HART CEO Dan Grabauskas blamed lawsuits, {{launched}} in 2011, {{for some of}} the cost overruns after bids to construct the first nine stations exceeded the budget by $100million.

He went into further detail on Front Row, in which he was asked if this was a shift in his beliefs: [...] "A shift in me in the sense I heard my father talk to me when I was in the garden one day. But I'm absolutely certain that what I heard was my memories of my father. An engram, or something in my head...This is not about God, but somewhere around there is where gods come from." ...|$|E
500|$|On 1 March Sunderland drew 0–0 away to Derby County. Michael Chopra <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> {{the team}} in the lead, only {{for it to be}} ruled out for offside. Sunderland's manager said, [...] "He [...] was clearly onside and we are always told that the {{advantage}} goes with the attacking player." [...] An Andrew Johnson goal on the verge of half time helped Everton to a 1–0 win at the Stadium of Light on 8 March. Sunderland lost consecutive games when Chelsea beat them 1–0 on 15 March due to a Didier Drogba goal. Andy Reid came close to putting Sunderland in front as his free kick was plucked from the top corner by Carlo Cudicini. Sunderland's first away win of the season came on 22 March when they won 1–0 at Villa Park against Aston Villa. An 83rd minute Michael Chopra scored the winning goal for Sunderland. A 2–1 win at home to West Ham United on 29 February helped Sunderland to their first consecutive wins of the season. Kenwyne Jones' first goal since late December levelled the score at 1–1 and a 95th minute Andy Reid goal won the game.|$|E
500|$|Others media {{publications}} {{were more}} critical of the show. Television critic Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that Stewart was more [...] "amusing than funny". He added, [...] "Many of his jokes fell flat with {{the stars in the}} Kodak Theatre, and his tendency to bow down before celebrities quickly grew tiresome." [...] Tom Shales from The Washington Post commented, [...] "It's hard to believe that professional entertainers <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> together a show less entertaining than this year's Oscars, hosted with a smug humorlessness by comic Jon Stewart, a sad and pale shadow of great hosts gone by." [...] Moreover, he derided the [...] "piles and piles and miles and miles of clips from films present and past" [...] writing that it [...] "squandered the visual luster" [...] of the ceremony. Associated Press television critic Frazier Moore remarked, [...] "Stewart, usually a very funny guy, displayed a lack of beginner's luck as first-time host...His usually impeccable blend of puckishness and self-effacement fell flat in the service of Oscar." [...] He also criticized the decision to play music over the winner's acceptance speeches calling it [...] "distracting and obnoxious." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2009–10 season, on 29 August 2009, Tasci {{extended}} his contract with Stuttgart until the summer of 2014. A buy-out clause was included as part of signing a new contract. He scored his first Champions League goal as Stuttgart drew 1–1 with Romanian side Unirea Urziceni in the group stage matchday two on 29 September 2009. In his first half of the season, Tasci captained three matches as a replacement for Thomas Hitzlsperger. He, however, sustained [...] "a stress fracture in his foot" [...] that <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> him out for the reminder of the season. He recovered after a few weeks and returned to the first team, where he scored his first goal of the Bundesliga season, in a 1–1 draw against VfL Bochum on 5 December 2009. Following Hitzlsperger removal of captaincy, Tasci was reportedly furious over not being chosen as a vice-captain. On 12 March 2010, he scored his second league goal of the season, in a 2–1 loss against Schalke 04. A week later on 19, Tasci was declared injured as he suffered a adductor problem. Six days later, he was declared fit, and was an unused substitute in a match against Bayern Munich. That season, Tasci made twenty-seven appearance despite recurrence of injuries he sustained during the 2009–10 season.|$|E
500|$|Twilight was in {{development}} for approximately {{three years at}} Paramount Pictures's MTV Films, during which time a screen adaptation differing significantly from the novel was written. For example, the script transformed Bella into a star athlete. Stephenie Meyer stated {{that there was some}} debate in allowing the movie to be made because of the negative or positive outcome of the movie compared to the book, '"They <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> that [...] movie out, called it something else, and no one would have known it was Twilight!" [...] The idea of seeing a scene converted correctly, specifically the meadow scene, convinced Meyer to sell the rights. In seeing the script, she was frightened that she had made the wrong decision. When Summit Entertainment reinvented itself as a full-service studio in April 2007, it successfully acquired the rights to the novel. Erik Feig, President of Production at Summit Entertainment, guaranteed a close adaptation to the book. The company perceived the film as an opportunity to launch a franchise based on the success of Meyer's book and its sequels. Meyer felt that Summit was open to letting her {{be a part of the}} film. Catherine Hardwicke was hired to direct the film, and soon afterward, Melissa Rosenberg was selected to be the film's structural base as the writer of the film.|$|E

Kozenczak as to where he believed Gacy had placed Piest's body, Rossi replied: [...] "In the crawl space; he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> him in the crawl space." [...] A polygraph test conducted upon the youth showed his responses to questions to be inconclusive; however, upon his agreeing to a subsequent visual test in which a map of Cook County was divided into 12 grid sections numbered 1 to 12, with Gacy's home marked in the fourth grid section, Kozenczak noted an extreme response in Rossi's blood pressure when asked: [...] "Is the body of Robert Piest buried in grid number 4?" [...] Upon hearing this question, Rossi refused to continue the polygraph questioning, although he did discuss further his digging trenches in the crawl space and remarked upon Gacy's insistence that he not deviate from where he was instructed to dig.|$|E
2500|$|Things did {{not improve}} for Bentley in 1945. She began {{an affair with a}} man whom she came to suspect was either an FBI or a Soviet agent sent to spy on her, and her Soviet contact {{suggested}} that she should emigrate to the Soviet Union—a move Bentley feared would end with her execution. In August 1945, Bentley went to the FBI office in New Haven, Connecticut and met with the agent in charge. She did not immediately defect, however. Instead she seemed to be [...] "feeling out" [...] the FBI, and it would not be until November that she began to tell her full story to the FBI. In the meantime, her situation continued to worsen. In September she met with Anatoly Gorsky, her latest NKGB controller, and arrived at the meeting drunk. [...] She became angry with Gorsky, called him and his fellow Russian agents [...] "gangsters", and obliquely threatened to become an informer.

2500|$|One of Hathcock's {{most famous}} accomplishments was {{shooting}} an enemy sniper through the enemy's own rifle scope, hitting {{him in the}} eye and killing him. Hathcock and John Roland Burke, his spotter, were stalking the enemy sniper in the jungle near Hill 55, the firebase from which Hathcock was operating, southwest of Da Nang. The sniper, known only as the [...] "Cobra," [...] had already killed several Marines and was believed to have been sent specifically to kill Hathcock. When Hathcock saw a flash of light (light reflecting off the enemy sniper's scope) in the bushes, he fired at it, shooting through the scope and killing the sniper. Surveying the situation, Hathcock concluded that the only feasible way he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> the bullet straight down the enemy's scope, through his eye, would have been if both snipers were zeroing in on each other at the same time, which gave him only a few seconds to act, and Hathcock fired first. Given the flight time of rounds at long ranges, the snipers could have simultaneously killed one another. Hathcock took possession of the dead sniper's rifle, hoping to bring it home as a [...] "trophy", but after he turned it in and tagged it, it was stolen from the armory.|$|E
