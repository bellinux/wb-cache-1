5|$|Unlike most artisan cheese makers, Beecher's mainly uses {{pasteurized milk}} and {{operates}} a high-volume modern production facility, with multiple farms supplying milk. When Beecher's encountered problems in guaranteeing the standard {{flavor of the}} milks they were using to make cheese, the company bought their own herds of dairy cattle and farms to ensure control of the <b>cheese</b> <b>products</b> from beginning to end. Beecher's uses various cheese cultures when mixing cheeses, so a cheddar cheese produced by Beecher's may use cultures not normally intended for cheddar cheese production.|$|E
5|$|Processed {{pizza cheese}} is {{manufactured}} to produce optimal qualities in browning, melting, stretchiness and fat and moisture content. Several studies and experiments have analyzed {{the impact of}} vegetable oil, manufacturing and culture processes, denatured whey proteins and other changes to create ideal and economical pizza cheeses. In 1997, {{it was estimated that}} annual production of pizza <b>cheese</b> <b>products</b> was 2 billion pounds in the United States and 200 million pounds in Europe, and in 2000 demand for the product in Europe was increasing by 8% per year. The trend of steadily-increasing production and consumption of mozzarella and pizza cheese continued into {{the first decade of the}} 21st century in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Salt {{is present}} in most foods, but in {{naturally}} occurring foodstuffs such as meats, vegetables and fruit, it {{is present in}} very small quantities. It is often added to processed foods (such as canned foods and especially salted foods, pickled foods, and snack foods or other convenience foods), where it functions as both a preservative and a flavoring. Dairy salt {{is used in the}} preparation of butter and <b>cheese</b> <b>products.</b> Before the advent of electrically powered refrigeration, salting {{was one of the main}} methods of food preservation. Thus, herring contains 67mg sodium per 100g, while kipper, its preserved form, contains 990mg. Similarly, pork typically contains 63mg while bacon contains 1,480mg, and potatoes contain 7mg but potato crisps 800mg per 100 g. The main sources of salt in the diet, apart from direct use of sodium chloride, are bread and cereal products, meat products and milk and dairy products.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{the demand}} for cheese has been {{increasing}} though {{the demand for}} other dairy products has been declining in Japan. Japanese Government has tried to support the enhancement of cheese production. Accordingly, major cheese manufacturers have been building up large-scale factories and are increasing production of cheese. However, {{there is a possibility}} that the demand for imported cheese increases while the demand for domestic <b>cheese</b> <b>product</b> remains the same level if the tariff of cheese is reduced by WTO agriculture negotiation in the future. In this paper, we analyze the substitutability between domestic <b>cheese</b> <b>product</b> and imported one by making use of POS data. Moreover, we forecast future demand for the domestic <b>cheese</b> <b>product</b> assuming two trade scenarios under the condition of reduction in tariff. The main results are as follows. First of all, the substitutability between domestic <b>cheese</b> <b>product</b> and imported one is low. Besides, the demand for the domestic <b>cheese</b> <b>product</b> continues to increase if the tariff is reduced. Therefore, it can be said that the support of the government to cheese production is appropriate. 本稿では,POSデータにより国産と外国産チーズを区別した上で,メーカー別に需要関数を推計し国産チーズと外国産チーズの代替性を明らかにした上で, 得られた推計値から関税削減下でのチーズの需要の将来予測を行ってきた. その結果,国産と外国産との代替性は有意でないメーカーが多く,有意である場合も非弾力的であることが明らかとなった. また,関税削減下での将来予測の結果,国産ナチュラルチーズに関 しては今後も需要量の増加が期待できるが,プロセスチーズに関しては,需要量が減少することが明らかと なった. つまり,国産チーズ増産支援政策によってチー ズの増産を行うことは,今後関税が削減された場合でも有効である可能性が高い. ただし,その内容は,ナ チュラルチーズを中心に行うべきであると考えられる...|$|R

In a two-year campaign to promote sales, Vegemite was given away free with Kraft Walker <b>cheese</b> <b>products</b> (with a coupon redemption) and {{this was followed by}} poetry competitions with imported American Pontiac cars being offered as prizes.

40|$|A {{reformed}} Swiss <b>cheese</b> <b>product</b> (RSCP) {{that does}} not contain emulsifying salts and which possess textural properties {{similar to that of}} natural Swiss cheese was developed. The product differs from a processed <b>cheese</b> <b>product</b> due to the absence of emulsifying salts, which were substituted with starch. Development of this product may add value to the natural Swiss cheese trimmings that are by-products of cheese manufacture as another option to processed cheese. The development began with the exploration of the effects of starch on the properties (texture, melting behavior, and chemical profile) of a processed <b>cheese</b> <b>product</b> which contained emulsifying salts. Results of texture profile analysis using a TAXT 2 texture analyzer suggest that starch addition may significantly increase hardness and chewiness. Modified Schreiber melt test results suggest that starch affects melting behavior by reducing the spread of the melt. These results corroborated with those reported for imitation and processed cheeses enriched with starch. Some authors associated these effects to the leaching of amylose into the protein matrix during cooking. However, in this study, the starches use...|$|R

Cheese curds containing polyphenolic compounds at a concentration of 0. 5 mg/mL showed a decrease of curd moisture content (CMC) while the gel strength (GS) was not affected.
