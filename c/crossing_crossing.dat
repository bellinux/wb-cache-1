30|$|In California, CalTrain {{developed}} their own design criteria regarding grade crossings and began implementing them in 1999 [6]. These standard practices utilize active warning devices similar to those at vehicular crossings: signal equipment modified from that of vehicular <b>crossing,</b> <b>crossing</b> gate arm, and a crossing configuration which channels pedestrians. Different design criteria apply for pedestrian crossings in general regarding warning time, center fence, warning devices, safety buffer zone, warning assemblies, gate recovery, as well as pedestrian crossings at stations, at stations and roadway, and crossings between roadway crossings.|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} few years, traffic {{accidents}} & congestion has increased enormously. Even in our daily life, we come across many problems caused due to traffic rule violation by some people. Also when {{we go through the}} daily newspaper, we realize that road accidents {{is one of the major}} problems now a days in every city. These problems cause disturbance to the whole system and also consumes our precious time. So in an attempt to reduce it & improve the traffic discipline, advanced technological solutions has been proposed. In this project, we are designing a system which will automatically incur penalty to the car driver for violation of traffic rules. The penalty will be automatically charged to the car owner if PUC has been expired or if car is standing on zebra crossing when the signal is red, for illegal signal <b>crossing,</b> <b>crossing</b> the speed limit in speed limit zone or parking the car in no parking zone. Also the car will not start if the driver does not have license or if he is drunk. This will help to bring discipline on roads...|$|E
40|$|Visual stimuli and {{socialization}} influence exploratory behaviour in crayfish. The predominant components of spontaneous exploratory behaviour {{were determined by}} observing the activity of solitary adult crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) in a glass aquarium containing fresh water and no objects. Five distinct behaviours were observed: rearing up (climbing on the wall), turning around, cornering (facing the comer), backward walking, and <b>crossing</b> (<b>crossing</b> the midline of the aquarium). The frequency of rearing up, cornering and turning around decreased when reflection from the glass wall was blocked with black cardboard, black paint or non-reflective transparent plastic. In a tank containing mirrors {{on one side and}} non-reflective plastic on the other, crayfish cornered, reared up, and turned around more in front of the mirrors. Socialization was necessary for crayfish to respond to the reflection. Crayfish that were housed in pairs for two weeks exhibited more rearing up, turning around and cornering in front of the mirrors than in the non-reflective side. Crayfish isolated for two weeks did not show these differences. Socialized crayfish also exhibited more rearing up, turning around and cornering than did isolated crayfish. Thus, crayfish respond to visual stimuli provided by a glass tank, but the responds depends on socialization...|$|E

40|$|Pedestrians {{are exposed}} to risks when {{crossing}} roads in urban areas. The crossing behaviour of pedestrians was studied as a factor contributing to their exposure to risks {{on the road and}} to their involvement in road accidents. This work explores two specific aspects of crossing behaviour: crossing speed and head pitches – the proportion of time pedestrians point their heads down (rather than towards the traffic) when crossing a road. The last one is used as an indicator of the (lack of) attention to cross-traffic. We also explored the possible effect of fear of falling (FOF) among pedestrians, as it might be associated with slow walking, less attention to cross traffic, and more attention to the pavement and their footsteps. This paper reports on a field study that combined an observatory technique with short survey. 203 pedestrians in two sites (signalised and unsignalised crosswalks) were video recorded while crossing the road. The FOF of pedestrians and other measures of pedestrian behaviour at crosswalks were revealed by means of questionnaire. Age and gender had the most significant effects on crossing speed, and FOF had a significant effect on the proportion of downward head pitches during <b>crossing.</b> <b>Crossing</b> behaviour; FOF (fear of falling); Age...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} an optimisation procedure {{for improvement of}} crossing performance by adjusting the cro sing (including the wing rail) geometry. The improvement of the crossing performance is achieved by reducing the normal contact pressure and wear index, while shifting {{the location of the}} wheel impact (fatigue area) along the crossing. By shifting the fatigue area the life of the crossing can be prolonged. To demonstrate the proposed procedure the geometry of a <b>crossing</b> (<b>crossing</b> angle 1 : 15) has been optimised. The effect of two typical wheel profiles used on the considered crossing is taken in to account during the optimisation. The robustness of the obtained geometries has been verified using the numerical simulations with track geometrical irregularities. Using the optimisation procedure two improved geometries of the crossing have been obtained. In both designs the normal contact pressure was reduced as compared to the reference design, while the fatigue area in the second crossing was shifted further from the tip point of the crossing as compared to the first crossing. Important is that the second crossing geometry can be obtained from the first crossing simply by grinding. To implement the new crossing geometry a new measurement device has been proposed. The device can be used for assessment of wear of existing crossings and during adjusting/restoration of the crossing geometry. Accepted Author ManuscriptRailway Engineerin...|$|E
