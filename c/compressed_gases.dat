GMAW produces smoke containing particles {{of various types}} of oxides, {{and the size of}} the particles in question tends to influence the toxicity of the fumes, with smaller particles presenting a greater danger. Additionally, carbon dioxide and ozone gases can prove dangerous if ventilation is inadequate. Furthermore, because the use of <b>compressed</b> <b>gases</b> in GMAW pose an explosion and fire risk, some common precautions include limiting the amount of oxygen in the air and keeping combustible materials away from the workplace.|$|E
5|$|Welders {{are often}} exposed to {{dangerous}} gases and particulate matter. Processes like flux-cored arc welding and shielded {{metal arc welding}} produce smoke containing particles of various types of oxides. The size of the particles in question tends to influence the toxicity of the fumes, with smaller particles presenting a greater danger. This is because smaller particles {{have the ability to}} cross the blood–brain barrier. Fumes and gases, such as carbon dioxide, ozone, and fumes containing heavy metals, can be dangerous to welders lacking proper ventilation and training. Exposure to manganese welding fumes, for example, even at low levels (<0.2 mg/m3), may lead to neurological problems or to damage to the lungs, liver, kidneys, or central nervous system. Nano particles can become trapped in the alveolar macrophages of the lungs and induce pulmonary fibrosis. The use of <b>compressed</b> <b>gases</b> and flames in many welding processes poses an explosion and fire risk. Some common precautions include limiting the amount of oxygen in the air, and keeping combustible materials away from the workplace.|$|E

2500|$|Because many common welding {{procedures}} involve an open {{electric arc}} or flame, {{the risk of}} burns from heat and sparks is significant. [...] To prevent them, welders wear protective clothing {{in the form of}} heavy leather gloves and protective long sleeve jackets to avoid exposure to extreme heat, flames, and sparks. The use of <b>compressed</b> <b>gases</b> and flames in many welding processes also pose an explosion and fire risk; some common precautions include limiting the amount of oxygen in the air and keeping combustible materials away from the workplace.|$|E
2500|$|Multiple disk {{machines}} and [...] "triplex" [...] electrostatic machines (generators with three disks) were also developed extensively {{around the turn}} of the 20th century. In 1900, F. Tudsbury discovered that enclosing a generator in a metallic chamber containing compressed air, or better, carbon dioxide, the insulating properties of <b>compressed</b> <b>gases</b> enabled a greatly improved effect to be obtained owing to the increase in the breakdown voltage of the compressed gas, and reduction of the leakage across the plates and insulating supports. In 1903, Alfred Wehrsen patented an ebonite rotating disk possessing embedded sectors with button contacts at the disk surface. In 1907, Heinrich Wommelsdorf reported a variation of the Holtz machine using this disk and inductors embedded in celluloid plates (DE154175; [...] "Wehrsen machine"). [...] Wommelsdorf also developed several high-performance electrostatic generators, of which the best known were his [...] "Condenser machines" [...] (1920). These were single disk machines, using disks with embedded sectors that were accessed at the edges.|$|E
