50|$|<b>Clumped</b> <b>distribution</b> is {{the most}} common type of {{dispersion}} found in nature. In <b>clumped</b> <b>distribution,</b> the distance between neighboring individuals is minimized. This type of distribution is found in environments that are characterized by patchy resources. Animals need certain resources to survive, and when these resources become rare during certain parts of the year animals tend to “clump” together around these crucial resources. Individuals might be clustered together in an area due to social factors such as selfish herds and family groups. Organisms that usually serve as prey form clumped distributions in areas where they can hide and detect predators easily.|$|E

These clumps are possible targets to search for dark matter annihilation with present and future γ-ray instruments. Many uncertainties exist on the <b>clump</b> <b>distribution,</b> leading to disputed conclusions about the expected number of detectable clumps and the ensuing limits that {{can be obtained from}} non-detection. In this paper, we use the CLUMPY code to simulate thousands of skymaps for several <b>clump</b> <b>distributions.</b> This allows us to statistically assess the typical properties (mass, distance, angular size, luminosity) of the detectable clumps. Varying parameters of the <b>clump</b> <b>distributions</b> allows us to identify the key quantities to which the number of detectable clumps is the most sensitive. Focusing our analysis on two extreme clump configurations, yet consistent with results from numerical simulations, we revisit and compare various calculations made for the Fermi-LAT instrument, in terms of number of dark clumps expected and the angular power spectrum for the Galactic signal. We then focus on the prospects of detecting dark clumps with the future CTA instrument, for which we make a detailed sensitivity analysis using open-source CTA software. Based on a realistic scenario for the foreseen CTA extragalactic survey, and accounting for a post-trial sensitivity in the survey, we show that we obtain competitive and complementary limits to those based on long observation of a single bright dwarf spheroidal galaxy.

50|$|<b>Clumped</b> <b>distribution</b> {{in species}} {{acts as a}} {{mechanism}} against predation {{as well as an}} efficient mechanism to trap or corner prey. African wild dogs, Lycaon pictus, use the technique of communal hunting to increase their success rate at catching prey. Studies have shown that larger packs of African wild dogs tend to have a greater number of successful kills. A prime example of <b>clumped</b> <b>distribution</b> due to patchy resources is the wildlife in Africa during the dry season; lions, hyenas, giraffes, elephants, gazelles, and many more animals are clumped by small water sources that are present in the severe dry season. It has also been observed that extinct and threatened species {{are more likely to be}} clumped in their distribution on a phylogeny. The reasoning behind this is that they share traits that increase vulnerability to extinction because related taxa are often located within the same broad geographical or habitat types where human-induced threats are concentrated. Using recently developed complete phylogenies for mammalian carnivores and primates it has been shown that the majority of instances threatened species are far from randomly distributed among taxa and phylogenetic clades and display <b>clumped</b> <b>distribution.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Variance/Mean ratio method focuses {{mainly on}} {{determining}} whether a species fits a randomly spaced distribution, but {{can also be used}} as evidence for either an even or <b>clumped</b> <b>distribution.</b> To utilize the Variance/Mean ratio method, data is collected from several random samples of a given population. In this analysis, it is imperative that data from at least 50 sample plots is considered. The number of individuals present in each sample is compared to the expected counts in the case of random distribution. The expected distribution can be found using Poisson distribution. If the variance/mean ratio is equal to 1, the population is found to be randomly distributed. If it is significantly greater than 1, the population is found to be <b>clumped</b> <b>distribution.</b> Finally, if the ratio is significantly less than 1, the population is found to be evenly distributed. Typical statistical tests used to find the significance of the variance/mean ratio include Student's t-test and chi squared.|$|E

50|$|When {{a species}} with a clumped pattern is {{compared}} with {{one that is}} randomly distributed with equal overall densities, p will be less for the species having the <b>clumped</b> <b>distribution</b> pattern.

50|$|Other {{causes of}} clumped {{distributions}} are {{the inability of}} offspring to independently move from their habitat. This is seen in juvenile animals that are immobile and strongly dependent upon parental care. For example, the bald eagle's nest of eaglets exhibits a clumped species distribution because all the offspring are in a small subset of a survey area before they learn to fly. <b>Clumped</b> <b>distribution</b> can be beneficial to the individuals in that group. However, in some herbivore cases, such as cows and wildebeests, the vegetation around them can suffer, especially if animals target one plant in particular.|$|E
30|$|At {{negative}} temperature like‐sign vortices tend to cluster {{very rapidly}} by the violent relaxation and make two clumps exclusively {{consisting of the}} same‐sign vortices. The self‐rotation time scale of the clumps is approximately T∼ 10.

After the violent relaxation, the <b>clump</b> <b>distribution</b> quasi‐statically maintains up to T= 200 which {{is the end of the}} simulation. On the other hand, at positive temperature both types of vortices spread over the circular area uniformly. There is no rapid relaxation process as the value of the stream function is almost zero due to the uniform and symmetric distributions of the positive and negative vortices. Thus, the induced velocity is almost zero everywhere in the circular domain.|$|R

40|$|The {{structural}} parameters, {{like the}} inclination, i {{and the position}} angle {{of the line of}} nodes (PA_lon) of the disk of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) are estimated using the JH photometric data of red clump stars from the Infrared Survey Facility - Magellanic Cloud Point Source Catalog (IRSF-MCPSC). The observed LMC region is divided into several sub-regions and stars in each region are cross identified with the optically identified red clump stars to obtain the near infrared magnitudes. The peak values of H magnitude and (J-H) colour of the observed red <b>clump</b> <b>distribution</b> are obtained by fitting a profile to the distributions and also by taking the average value of magnitude and colour of the red clump stars in the bin with largest number. Then the dereddened peak H 0 magnitude of the red clump stars in each sub-region is obtained. The RA, Dec and relative distance from the center of each sub-region are converted into x, y & z Cartesian coordinates. A weighted least square plane fitting method is applied to this x,y,z data to estimate the structural parameters of the LMC disk. A reddening map based on (J-H) colour of the RC stars is presented. When the peaks of the red <b>clump</b> <b>distribution</b> were identified by averaging, an inclination of 25. 7 +/- 1. 6 and PA_lon = 141. 5 +/- 4. 5 were obtained. We estimate a distance modulus of 18. 47 +/- 0. 1 mag to the LMC. Extra-planar features which are in front as well as behind the fitted plane are identified which match with the optically identified extra-planar features. The bar of the LMC is found {{to be part of the}} disk within 500 pc. The estimates of the structural parameters are found to be independent of the photometric bands used for the analysis.

50|$|The {{distribution}} of species into clumped, uniform, or random depends on different abiotic and biotic factors. Any non-living chemical or physical {{factor in the}} environment is considered an abiotic factor. There are three main types of abiotic factors: climatic factors consist of sunlight, atmosphere, humidity, temperature, and salinity; edaphic factors are abiotic factors regarding soil, such as the coarseness of soil, local geology, soil pH, and aeration; and social factors include land use and water availability. An example {{of the effects of}} abiotic factors on species distribution can be seen in drier areas, where most individuals of a species will gather around water sources, forming a <b>clumped</b> <b>distribution.</b>|$|E
50|$|Biotic factors, such as predation, disease, and {{competition}} for {{resources such as}} food, water, and mates, can also affect how a species is distributed. A biotic factor is any behavior of an organism that affects another organism, such as a predator consuming its prey. For example, biotic factors in a quail’s environment would include their prey (insects and seeds), competition from other quail, and their predators, such as the coyote. An advantage of a herd, community, or other <b>clumped</b> <b>distribution</b> allows a population to detect predators earlier, at a greater distance, and potentially mount an effective defense. Due to limited resources, populations may be evenly distributed to minimize competition, as is found in forests, where competition for sunlight produces an even distribution of trees.|$|E

A mixed Poisson incidence process with a zero-truncated negative binomial <b>distribution</b> for the <b>clump</b> sizes is shown to give an adequate description, suggesting that the acquisition of hydatid cysts in the sheep population is heterogeneous, and that the clump sizes are aggregated.

Highly aggregated distributions of C. rubens occur within and among umbrella trees. <b>Clumped</b> <b>distributions</b> within trees appear {{to result from}} variable birth and death rates and limited movement of first instar crawlers.

50|$|Disturbances {{alter the}} {{population}} dynamics of Dioon edule populations. If {{a population is}} heavily dominated by adult plants, the disturbance will be minimal {{as compared to the}} population consisting of younger plants. This is due to their ability to survive harsh conditions. D. edule exemplifies a Type III survivorship curve and clumped distributions. It is found mostly on shallow, rocky soils due to competition with other, faster growing species for water, nutrients and seed dispersal. In response, they have developed a selective advantage for growing in these harsh climates including vigorous tap roots for anchorage and water conduction. Furthermore, it is harder for rodents to reach the plant and seeds if they are established in difficult locations to reach. In addition to competition, causal agents of D. edule's random, <b>clumped</b> <b>distribution</b> include predation, variations in temperature and precipitation, and measures of seed dispersal.|$|E
50|$|Blue mussels {{occasionally}} form clumps, or aggregates, {{of individuals}} when population density is low.The mussels attach {{to one another}} via collagenous protein strands called byssal threads. The aggregates are observed mostly in Mussel fields, which are short-lived populations of Mussels, usually exhibiting a <b>clumped</b> <b>distribution</b> pattern. It is hypothesized that the mussels form these aggregates to increase reproductive success in low density populations. This hypothesis, however, {{has yet to be}} conclusively proven. Alternative possible reasons for the behavior include resisting wave action and increasing water flow through the siphons of the mussel. The significance of the behavior is its relation to the formation of mussel beds from mussel fields. Mussel beds are persistent, dense mussel populations. Beds generally form from fields that persist long enough to establish a dense population. Thus in areas where blue mussels are threatened, such as the Wadden Sea, it is of great importance to enhance the survival of mussel fields, of which mussel aggregates are the primary component.|$|E
5000|$|Less {{common than}} <b>clumped</b> <b>distribution,</b> uniform distribution, {{also known as}} even distribution, is evenly spaced. Uniform {{distributions}} are found in populations in which the distance between neighboring individuals is maximized. The need to maximize the space between individuals generally arises from competition for a resource such as moisture or nutrients, or {{as a result of}} direct social interactions between individuals within the population, such as territoriality. For example, penguins often exhibit uniform spacing by aggressively defending their territory among their neighbors. The burrows of great gerbils for example are also regularly distributed, which can be seen on satellite images. Plants also exhibit uniform distributions, like the creosote bushes in the southwestern region of the United States. Salvia leucophylla is a species in California that naturally grows in uniform spacing. This flower releases chemicals called terpenes which inhibit the growth of other plants around it and results in uniform distribution. [...] This is an example of allelopathy, which is the release of chemicals from plant parts by leaching, root exudation, volatilization, residue decomposition and other processes. Allelopathy can have beneficial, harmful, or neutral effects on surrounding organisms. Some allelochemicals even have selective effects on surrounding organisms; for example, the tree species Leucaena leucocephala exudes a chemical that inhibits the growth of other plants but not those of its own species, and thus can affect the distribution of specific rival species. Allelopathy usually results in uniform distributions, and its potential to suppress weeds is being researched. [...] Farming and agricultural practices often create uniform distribution in areas where it would not previously exist, for example, orange trees growing in rows on a plantation.|$|E

40|$|Dual-frequency VLA and multifrequency VLBI {{observations}} {{of a number}} of sources in the Galactic plane have been made and used to estimate the amount of interstellar scattering in the Galactic plane as manifested by angular broadening of the observed sources.

The observed scattering in the Galactic plane decreases with increasing Galactic longitude, reaching a minimum at l roughly 60 deg and then becomes prominent again in the Cygnus region. The magnitude of scattering in the interarm region between l = 50 - 70 deg is comparable to that predicted by a model calculation of a 'smooth' component of interstellar turbulence.

40|$|Simple {{simulations}} {{suggest that}} the phase space structure of haloes identified in cosmological calculations is invariant under the dynamics induced by sinking substructure satellites [...] the background expands so as to leave the total distribution unchanged. We use a Fokker-Planck formulation to show {{that this is the}} case. The solutions obtained are valid for any mass spectrum of substructure, because the governing equation is linear in their mass weighed phase space <b>distribution.</b> If the <b>clumps</b> are considered solid, an exchange of poulations takes the form of an exponential instability, with characteristic timescale of the order of the dynamical friction time, leading to a low energy cutoff in the distribution function of the background and a constant density core. We show that there are long lived solutions with such a cutoff. They approximate a situation whereas the clumps are made of dense baryonic material. When stripping is important, {{as in the case of}} dissipationless substructure, it is likely that this situation is reversed [...] the cutoff is now in the <b>clump</b> <b>distribution</b> function. A simple description suggests that this renders equilibria even more long lived. The results of this paper suggest that halo profiles similar to those found in dissipationless cosmological simulations are approximately invariant under the interaction induced by the presence of substructure satellites [...] a necessary condition for the observed `universality'. In addition, the total profile, including baryons, should also be invariant; provided the latter are initially in the form of dense <b>clumps,</b> whose <b>distribution</b> follows that of the dark matter.
