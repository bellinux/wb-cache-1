50|$|Traktor {{was first}} {{released}} in 2000 and {{has gone through}} several major application changes. The initial versions of Traktor were Traktor Studio and Traktor DJ, with Traktor Studio being more full featured (and expensive). In 2002, Traktor DJ Studio 2 was released, which offered several new features including scratch macros. It also expanded its looping, MIDI, and <b>cue</b> <b>point</b> functionality. In 2003, Traktor DJ Studio 2.5 was released. This new version expanded the time stretching functionality, added Open Sound Control (OSC) support, and gave the user limited ability to customize {{the look of the}} interface.|$|E
5000|$|A {{rudimentary}} form of turntable manipulation {{which is}} related to scratching {{was developed in the}} late 1940s radio DJs (music program hosts) or the radio program producers who did their own technical operation as audio console operators. It was known as back-cueing, and was used to find {{the very beginning of the}} start of a song (i.e., the <b>cue</b> <b>point)</b> on a vinyl record groove. This was done to permit the operator to back the disc up (rotate the record or the turntable platter itself counter-clockwise) in order to permit the turntable to be switched on, and come up to full speed without ruining the first few bars of music with the [...] "wow" [...] of incorrect, unnaturally slow-speed playing. This permitted the announcer to time her or his remarks and start the turntable a scant moment before she or he actually wanted the music on the record to begin.|$|E
30|$|After {{determining}} the transition type, <b>cue</b> <b>points</b> are determined {{for each of}} the six remaining song candidates. Given that particular choice of <b>cue</b> <b>points,</b> the automatic DJ system estimates the quality of the crossfades in the two final steps to make a final selection for the next song.|$|R

30|$|Rolling transition: the <b>cue</b> <b>point</b> in {{the current}} song is 32 {{measures}} before the next transition from a high to a low segment. The <b>cue</b> <b>point</b> in the next song is the downbeat 16 measures before a drop. The fade-in and fade-out are both 16 measures long. In this transition, the second song its drop continues the energetic nature of the high section of the preceding song.|$|E
30|$|To {{achieve this}} performance, {{dedicated}} algorithms for tempo estimation, beat detection, downbeat detection, and <b>cue</b> <b>point</b> selection were developed.|$|E

30|$|Once the <b>cue</b> <b>points</b> are known, the {{crossfade}} is established. This happens by time-stretching the audio, applying volume fading and equalization {{filters and}} then adding the two songs {{together in a}} beatmatched way. The tempo is fixed at 175 BPM for the entire mix. This process is explained in more detail in Section 4.3.|$|R
30|$|The system is, to {{the best}} of the author’s knowledge, the first {{complete}} and fully integrated automatic DJ system that considers all basic DJing best practices, i.e., beatmatching, <b>cue</b> <b>point</b> selection, music style-based track selection, equalization, and different transition types. It is released as open-source 1 and could hence serve as a robust basis for further research to build upon.|$|E
30|$|Relaxed transition: the <b>cue</b> <b>point</b> in {{the current}} song is 16 {{measures}} before the next transition from a high to a low segment. The next song is started at the beginning, i.e., its first structural boundary. The fade-in and fade-out are both 16 measures long. In this way, the energetic nature of the mix is interrupted, giving the listener some time to relax.|$|E
30|$|Section 3 {{described}} how the proposed DJ system analyzes music {{to gain a}} detailed understanding of it much like a human DJ has. The current section elucidates how the proposed DJ system also simulates parts of the creative process of a human DJ, i.e., a creative track and <b>cue</b> <b>point</b> selection and a variation of transition types, leveraging the detailed musical understanding to generate high-quality mixes.|$|E

30|$|Jehan [4] {{proposes a}} simple {{automatic}} DJ system that automatically matches downbeats and crossfades songs. Cue points {{are determined by}} finding rhythmically similar sections in the mixed songs, {{but it does not}} consider the high-level structure of the music. Bouckenhove and Martens [5] describe a system that uses vocal activity detection to avoid overlapping vocal sections of two songs. With their Music Paste system, Lin et al. [6] automate the track and <b>cue</b> <b>point</b> selection process by maximizing a measure for musical similarity. The length of the transition is optimized such that the rate of tempo change remains under an acceptable threshold, which is determined in a subjective experiment. Ishizaki et al. [7] also focus on the optimization of a crossfade with a changing tempo. They propose to use an intermediary tempo in between the tempi of the original songs, such that the discomfort caused by the tempo change is spread evenly between the two songs. Finally, the MusicMixer project by Hirai [8] improves the track and <b>cue</b> <b>point</b> selection process by means of two similarity measures related to the beat structure and a high-level abstraction of the chromatic content of the audio, inspired by natural language processing techniques.|$|E

These mechanisms store meta data about the sound files. In this paper, we identity and describe how these formats are encoded, and process meta data information with a focus on cue points. Finally, we conclude with the direction of our future research for improving multimedia browsing mechanisms and additional applications by leveraging the use of cue points within those applications...|$|E
50|$|Most DJ {{controllers}} emulate two turntables/CDJs and a DJ mixer. However, DJ controllers {{are much}} cheaper than two turntables or CDJs plus a mixer. Unlike turntables, controllers {{can take advantage}} of the flexibility of computer software, for example, by allowing the DJ to store multiple <b>cue</b> <b>points</b> with music files. Also, DJ software allows users to remap the components of controllers to perform different functions than the controller manufacturer intended.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 46 - 47) The mixed standard scale {{developed by}} Blanz & Ghiselli (1972) {{was compared to}} two graphic rating scale formats {{to determine if the}} mixed standard scale reduced the common rating errors of halo, leniency and central tendency, and improved the interrater reliability. Thirty-six Ss were randomly assigned to three equal groups with each group using a different rating scale. The three scales used were the mixed standard scale, a graphic scale with descriptive <b>cue</b> <b>points</b> identical to those used in the mixed standard scale, and a graphic scale with non-descriptive <b>cue</b> <b>points.</b> The Ss viewed and rated three video-taped speeches using one of the scales. The results indicate no clear superiority of any one scale format in terms of halo, leniency, central tendency or reliability. There were, however, trends towards less halo and more central tendency when using the mixed standard scale. The differences between scales were very much dependent on the particular speech being rated. It was concluded that the mixed standard scale did not reduce the common rating errors...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{proposed}} here the graphical password authentication system in replacement/alternative {{of the text}} password using <b>Cued</b> Click <b>Point</b> (CCP) method[1]. It based on <b>cued</b> click <b>points.</b> Users click on point of the image from the sequence of the images. The next image/input depends on the past click or past input. It is simply nothing {{but the use of}} image or sequence of images appearing one by one in a sequence and task related it to drive the password authentication activity. The main purpose of this system is generating complex to guess to hackers but easy to remember the password to user. User preferred to select using one point rather on image rather than selecting multiple <b>points.</b> <b>Cued</b> click <b>point</b> is easy for user to use and implement as well as it is easy to recognize. CCP is best than pass point because maximum number of images can reduce the guessing attacks and makes it confusable to the hackers...|$|R
30|$|With {{the songs}} and cue points in mind, the DJ {{performs}} the actual mixing. He or she plays the first song and waits until it reaches the <b>cue</b> <b>point</b> to start the second song. For some time, both songs will be heard simultaneously, gradually fading out the first song and fading in the next. When simultaneously playing two songs, {{it is imperative that}} their beats align in time: even a very small misalignment is easily noticed even by the amateur. To make this possible, one or both songs may have to be slowed down or sped up by time-stretching them such that their tempi are equal. The beats are then aligned in a process called beatmatching.|$|E
30|$|During {{the mixing}} process, {{the track and}} <b>cue</b> <b>point</b> {{selection}} algorithm determines the next song and cue points, given the current song. Three transition types, inspired by how professional DJs compose their mix and perform crossfades, are possible. The type is chosen using a Finite State Machine, which ensures variation in the mix by preventing that certain transition types happen twice in a row. The transition type defines which segments (“low” or “high”) of the first song and the new song are overlapped, i.e., it defines possible cue points (Section 4.2. 3). The next song is selected such that the resulting mix is musically coherent as a whole while ensuring that individual song transitions are enjoyable to listen to. Details of this selection process are explained in Section 4.2.|$|E
30|$|However, {{some aspects}} of the system could still be {{evaluated}} in more detail, while others could be improved or extended. An obvious direction of further evaluation is to adapt the proposed system to different EDM genres. For some genres, this can be as straightforward as adapting the tempo range, and potentially retraining the downbeat tracker on some annotated songs in the target genre. However, as different genres might require different styles of mixing [2], for some genres, more modifications might be required (e.g., implementing additional transition types). Additionally, comparing the different transition types or even the DJ system as a whole with for example transitions performed by a human expert or a commercial automatic DJ system would also be very informative, and offers a great direction of further research. Several extensions and augmentations are also possible. Firstly, the annotation modules would benefit from a built-in reliability measure to discard songs with uncertain annotations. Furthermore, the used vocal activity detection and key estimation algorithms are simple baseline versions and subject to improvement. To improve the <b>cue</b> <b>point</b> selection, a finer distinction between section types could be implemented, instead of only considering “low” and “high” sections. This could lead to more precise <b>cue</b> <b>point</b> positions or a more diverse set of transition types. It would furthermore be very interesting to make the volume and equalization progressions throughout the transitions adapt to the songs being mixed, instead of following a fixed pattern as in the current implementation. Finally, even though the track selection method yields pleasing results, it might be an oversimplification of how professional DJs compose their sets and create a deliberate progression of energy and mood throughout the mix. A model that better understands the long-term structures and composition of a good Drum and Bass mix, e.g., learned using the abundance of professional Drum and Bass mixes that can be found online, might therefore lead to a better result.|$|E

30|$|The {{track and}} <b>cue</b> <b>point</b> {{selection}} {{is done in}} five steps that iteratively narrow down the options for potential successors of the current song. Firstly, only songs that are in key with the current song are considered (Section 4.2. 1). Of these songs, the six most similar songs in terms of musical style are selected as potential successors (Section 4.2. 2). In the third step, cue points are determined for the current song and for the candidate successors (Section 4.2. 3). The two final steps heuristically estimate the musical quality of each potential overlap. More specifically, vocal activity is detected such that overlapping vocals of both songs is avoided (Section 4.2. 4), and rhythmic similarity is estimated by comparing the songs their ODFs (Section 4.2. 5). The song with the highest rhythmic similarity to the current song and without vocal clashes is selected as the next song.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to measure subtle disturbances in information processing after mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) for spatially presented stimuli as compared to a sample of control participants. Participants completed a temporal order judgment task requiring the correct identification of the order of two asynchronously presented stimuli that were precued either by a peripheral or central <b>cue.</b> <b>Point</b> of subjective simultaneity (PSS) scores demonstrated a dissociation in spatial attentional control. Specifically, deficits for the group with mild TBI were observed for peripheral cues, while volitional attentional control during the centrally cued task was spared, when compared with controls. These data suggest that peripheral distraction strongly captures attention, possibly making disengagement from that location difficult, whereas directed and volitional control over attention is largely spared, as indicated by indistinguishable PSS scores when compared with healthy controls after central cues.

30|$|It {{should be}} pointed out that the {{workflow}} described above is a simplification and not an exact step-by-step recipe of the DJing workflow. For conciseness, some aspects of the DJing process have not been elaborated on in detail. For example, depending on the audience or type of event, DJs might employ a different mixing style and consider some aspects of the process (e.g., correct beatmatching) to be less or more important than other DJs in other scenarios [2]. It should also be clear that DJing is an iterative process, i.e., the steps shown in Fig.  1 are often repeated and interwoven as the mix progresses. For example, improvisation plays an important role in DJing ([3], p. 312) and DJs do not always know beforehand which songs they will play: the track selection and <b>cue</b> <b>point</b> selection process are hence repeated “on the fly” while the DJ is mixing. For a more thorough introduction into the art of DJing, we refer to relevant works in non-academic [1, 2] and academic literature [3].|$|E
