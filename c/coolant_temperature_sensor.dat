50|$|Once the new sensor {{has been}} installed, start {{the engine and}} {{disconnect}} the blue <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor.</b> Rev the engine through 3,000 rpm three times, each time allowing the throttle to close completely. This clears the Digifant ECM fault memory.|$|E
50|$|The ECU {{sends out}} a {{regulated}} reference voltage (typically 5 volts) to the <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor.</b> The voltage drop across the sensor will change {{according to the}} temperature because its resistance changes. The ECU is then able to calculate {{the temperature of the}} engine, and then (with inputs from other engine sensors) uses lookup tables to carry out adjustments to the engine actuators, i.e. change the fuel injection or ignition timing.|$|E

50|$|The M70 has two Motronic 1.7 ECUs (one {{for each}} {{cylinder}} bank). To provide redundancy, the M70 also has two fuel pumps, fuel rails, distributors, {{mass air flow}} sensors, crankshaft position <b>sensors,</b> <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors</b> and throttle bodies.|$|R
50|$|The {{assembled}} controller takes {{input from}} several sensors {{in order to}} manage the fuel injectors, including a throttle position sensor (TPS), exhaust gas oxygen sensor (EGO or O2 sensor), MAP sensor, tach signal (or crank position sensor), {{intake air temperature sensor}} (IAT), and a <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor</b> (CLT). The latter two sensors themselves are usually the General Motors type, although the controller can recalibrated to use other sensors including Ford and Bosch.|$|E
50|$|The engine <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor</b> {{is located}} in the coolant flange,(under the {{distributor}} on the Polo Fox Coupe) {{on the front of the}} cylinder head (on transverse-engine vehicles). The bad earth/ground can be traced to an essential ground strap on the front upper transmission bolt. Without this, the ECU tends to earth/ground elsewhere, causing a specific trace to burn out on the circuit board and killing the ECU. This causes the injectors to stay open constantly, flooding the engine.|$|E
50|$|The <b>coolant</b> <b>{{temperature}}</b> <b>sensor</b> is used {{to measure}} the temperature of the engine coolant of an internal combustion engine. The readings from this sensor are then fed back to the engine control unit (ECU), which uses this data to adjust the fuel injection and ignition timing. On some vehicles the sensor may also be used to switch on the electric cooling fan. The data may also be used to provide readings for a coolant temperature gauge on the dashboard.|$|E
40|$|Cal Poly Supermileage is a student-run {{engineering}} {{club that}} builds prototype gasoline vehicles optimized maximum fuel-efficiency. To power their vehicles, the Supermileage team {{makes use of}} single-cylinder, 4 -stroke, electronically fuel-injected (EFI) gasoline engines. This report details the development, iterative design 2 ̆ 6 test cycles, and integration of an EFI system for the Supermileage club. This project develops an EFI system that interfaces to the most common types of sensors found in the low-power Supermileage-range of engines, including throttle-position sensors, manifold absolute pressure sensors, gear-tooth hall-effect sensors, variable-reluctance position <b>sensors,</b> engine <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors,</b> intake air <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors,</b> and exhaust oxygen sensors. This system also control engine actuators, including inductive ignition coils and fuel injectors. To ensure the success of EFI system integration into the Supermileage vehicle, the current vehicle communication and electrical power systems are incorporated into this system’s design. In order for the club to test their vehicle properly and implement a data-acquisition system, the EFI system communicates current sensor data, fuel map information, and any software-detected errors...|$|R

50|$|Some {{versions}} of the engine implemented switchable Traction Control (commonly included in the early Astra GSi models). The inlet had a secondary throttle valve sandwiched underneath the primary throttle body. This is closed by a motor/arm assembly when the traction control ECU senses loss of grip/spin at the wheels. The engine was also equipped with a different throttle position sensor (six pin, as opposed to three), and a different <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor</b> (which was black, {{as opposed to the}} normal light blue colour).|$|E
5000|$|Data {{representing}} {{the amount of}} power output desired by the driver (sometimes known as [...] "engine load") is also used by the engine control unit in calculating the amount of fuel required. A throttle position sensor (TPS) provides this information. Other engine sensors used in EFI systems include a <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor,</b> a camshaft or crankshaft position sensor (some systems get the position information from the distributor), and an oxygen sensor which is installed in the exhaust system {{so that it can}} be used to determine how well the fuel has been combusted, therefore allowing closed loop operation.|$|E
5000|$|Most modern engines {{use some}} type of fuel {{injection}} to deliver fuel to the cylinders. The ECU determines the amount of fuel to inject based {{on a number of}} sensor readings. Oxygen sensors tell the ECU whether the engine is running rich (too much fuel/too little oxygen) or running lean (too much oxygen/too little fuel) as compared to ideal conditions (known as stoichiometric). The throttle position sensors tell the ECU how far the throttle plate is opened when you press the accelerator. The mass air flow sensor measures the amount of air flowing into the engine through the throttle plate. The engine <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor</b> measures whether the engine is warmed up or cool. (If the engine is still cool, additional fuel will be injected.) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{stabilization}} of a front pattern in a homogeneous tubular reactor model is studied. Linear stability analysis {{combined with the}} Galerkin method is used for state feedback control of the distributed parameter system. The capabilities of the global control and point-sensor control to stabilize the front solution are studied by manipulation of various reactor parameters including uid ow and feed conditions. Point-sensor control in coolant ow (heat-loss coecient) or <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature</b> are the most eective when the <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor</b> is located close to the front position. Global control, based on a space-averaged sensor, and other strategies failed. A qualitative analysis is suggested for selection of proper control of front stabilization...|$|R

5000|$|The SBEC {{controlled}} the ignition, {{as well as}} the opening and closing of the fuel injectors. During cold startup, wide-open throttle and deceleration, it did this based on [...] "open-loop", pre-programmed operating parameters. During normal idle and cruising, it began [...] "closed-loop" [...] operation, during which the module acted based upon inputs from a variety of sensors. The basic sensors that provided input to the SBEC included the Oxygen sensor (O2), Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor, Throttle Position Sensor (TPS), Intake Air Temperature (IAT) sensor and <b>Coolant</b> <b>Temperature</b> <b>sensor</b> (CTS). The basic actuators controlled by the SBEC's outputs included the fuel injectors, ignition coil and pickup, and the Idle Air Control (IAC) valve. The latter controlled idle characteristics. However, the SBEC also {{controlled the}} operation of the charging system, air conditioning system, cruise control and, in some vehicles, transmission shifting. By centralizing control of these systems, the operation of the vehicle was simplified and streamlined.|$|E
5000|$|The first EGR {{systems were}} crude; some were {{as simple as}} an orifice jet between the exhaust and intake tracts which {{admitted}} exhaust to the intake tract whenever the engine was running. Difficult starting, rough idling, and reduced performance and fuel economy resulted. By 1973, an EGR valve controlled by manifold vacuum opened or closed to admit exhaust to the intake tract only under certain conditions. Control systems grew more sophisticated as automakers gained experience; Chrysler's [...] "Coolant Controlled Exhaust Gas Recirculation" [...] system of 1973 exemplified this evolution: a <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor</b> blocked vacuum to the EGR valve until the engine reached normal operating temperature. This prevented driveability problems due to unnecessary exhaust induction; NOx forms under elevated temperature conditions generally not present with a cold engine. Moreover, the EGR valve was controlled, in part, by vacuum drawn from the carburetor's venturi, which allowed more precise constraint of EGR flow to only those engine load conditions under which NOx is likely to form. Later, backpressure transducers {{were added to the}} EGR valve control to further tailor EGR flow to engine load conditions. Most modern engines now need exhaust gas recirculation to meet emissions standards. However, recent innovations have {{led to the development of}} engines that do not require them. The 3.6 Chrysler Pentastar engine is one example that does not require EGR.|$|E
50|$|The {{most notable}} {{change of the}} RC45 when {{released}} {{was the use of}} Programmed Fuel Injection. Fuel injection had been used on bikes previously but these had either been rather antiquated analog computers or very simple digital units with a minimal number of sensors for input, which resulted in very crude fueling. The RC30 had used 38 mm constant velocity carburettors which, for road use are quite nice, maintaining a high air velocity across a wide rpm range, though were not as well suited for racing. The RC45 did away with carburetors and in their absence a brace of four 46 mm throttles were replaced, Honda now had the throttle area it needed to make big horsepower at high revolutions. The system Honda used on the RC45 was very similar to the system used on the NR750. Contrary to popular belief the RC45’s fuel injection is not like a 4-stage carburetor, rather it is a proper fuel only system. Honda kept the ignition system separate. The Honda system obtained information from the following sensors: crankshaft position sensor, camshaft position sensor, air temperature sensor, <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor,</b> manifold absolute pressure sensor, throttle position sensor, barometric sensor and battery voltage. With all of these sensors relaying information to the ECU, Honda could have quite easily incorporated the ignition control unit. The reason that they had not came down to the supplier of parts: they had different manufacturers supplying the ecu and cdi units. Regardless, it allowed the use of very large throttle plates seamlessly over a very wide engine operating range. The engine of the RC45 also used many magnesium castings, as of rather recently, it has become quite common to see fuel injection and magnesium engine parts on motorcycles, though in the early-to-mid 1990’s this was expensive and incredibly innovative.|$|E
40|$|Engine thermal {{management}} systems (TMS) are gaining importance in engine development and calibration to achieve low fuel consumption and meet future emissions standards. To benefit from their full potential, {{a thorough understanding}} of the effects on engine behavior is necessary. Steady state tests were performed on a 2. 0 L direct injection diesel engine at different load points. A design of experiments (DoE) approach was used to conduct exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and injection timing swings at different <b>coolant</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The effect of the standard engine controller and calibration was observed during these tests. The injection timing strategy included a significant dependency on <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature,</b> retarding injection by about 3 °crank angle between <b>coolant</b> <b>temperatures</b> of 70 °C and 86 °C. In contrast, EGR strategy was essentially independent of <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature,</b> though physical interactions were present {{due in part to the}} EGR cooler. Of the three mechanisms investigated, EGR had the largest effect on Nitrous oxides (NO) and fuel consumption and also had the largest potential for NO reduction over the stable engine operating range. Despite this, a reduction in <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature</b> from 86 °C to 50 °C reduced NO by 4. 5 % at high load condition. However, <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature</b> adjustments offer similar or better trade-offs than the other calibration parameters. For example, <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature</b> offers 10 % improvement NO per percentage increase in fuel consumption, compared to 4 % for injection timing and 13 % for EGR. Higher <b>coolant</b> <b>temperatures</b> reduce ignition delay and premix burn during combustion, but this effect is more pronounced at lower engine loads. Analysis of mean effective pressures (MEP) showed friction MEP (FMEP) and pumping MEP (PMEP) reduce with higher operating temperatures, which yielded lower gross indicated MEP (IMEP). FMEP was slightly higher at higher load, with a 1. 5 % to 5. 4 % increase depending on operating temperature. This increase was expected to be due to the increased loading between parts within the engine, but would be offset by potentially higher local oil temperatures...|$|R
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} Navier Stokes code {{has been}} used to study the effect of <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature,</b> and <b>coolant</b> to mainstream mass flow ratio on the adiabatic effectiveness of a film-cooled turbine blade. The blade chosen is the VKI rotor with six rows of cooling holes including three rows on the shower head. The mainstream is akin to that under real engine conditions with stagnation temperature = 1900 K and stagnation pressure = 3 MPa. Generally, the adiabatic effectiveness is lower for a higher <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature</b> due to nonlinear effects via the compressibility of air. However, over the suction side of shower-head holes, the effectiveness is higher for a higher <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature</b> than that for a lower <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature</b> when the <b>coolant</b> to mainstream mass flow ratio is 5 % or more. For a fixed <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature,</b> the effectiveness passes through a minima on the suction side of shower-head holes as the coolant to mainstream mass flow, ratio increases, while on the pressure side of shower-head holes, the effectiveness decreases with increase in coolant mass flow due to coolant jet lift-off. In all cases, the adiabatic effectiveness is highly three-dimensional...|$|R
50|$|If {{the design}} of the {{liquid-cooling}} system allows for high <b>coolant</b> <b>temperatures,</b> energy can be saved or even reused, depending on the climate conditions and on the local infrastructure. For example, free cooling is possible if the <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature</b> is higher than the ambient temperature. In that case the energy for chillers can be saved. If the <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature</b> is even higher, the waste heat from the compute equipment could be used for heating purposes or to drive an adsorption chiller to generate chilled water. The former option is implemented, e.g., by theLeibniz-Rechenzentrum in Germany, where SuperMUC drives the heating of the data center during winter with roughly 1 MW recovered from the compute equipment. The latter option, which is the design target of iDataCool, requires a high quality of the heat, which can only be achieved by direct hot-water cooling. One example for direct hot-water cooling is the Aquasar project at ETH Zürich, which is operated at <b>coolant</b> <b>temperatures</b> around 60°C.The aim of iDataCool was to achieve <b>coolant</b> <b>temperatures</b> of more than 65°C, at which commercially available adsorption chillers tend to become efficient, and to demonstrate the long-term stability of a large production machine under these conditions.|$|R

40|$|Wax {{deposition}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} flow assurance problems in the oil industry. It can result in the restriction of crude oil flow in the pipeline, creating pressure abnormalities and causing an artificial blockage leading to a reduction or interruption in the production. Wax can precipitate as a solid phase on the pipe wall when its <b>temperature</b> (inlet <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature)</b> drops below the Wax Appearance Temperature (WAT). An experimental flow loop system was built in the lab to study the variation of wax deposition thickness under the single phase transport. A series of experiments were carried out at different flow rates (2. 7 and 4. 8 L/min) to study wax deposition and measure the wax thickness using four different techniques including direct technique pigging, pressure drop, heat transfer and liquid displacement-level detection (LD-LD). The effect of factors on wax formation such as inlet <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature,</b> inhibitor and spiral flow has been examined.
