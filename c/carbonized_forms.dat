The {{addition of the}} bone particles ranges from 5 to 25 wt% in uncarbonized and <b>carbonized</b> <b>forms</b> in the polypropylene matrix.

The results revealed that the addition of carbonized bone particles reinforcement has superior properties than uncarbonized bone particles composite based materials with an increase in the compressive strength, hardness values, tensile strength and flexural strength by 53 %, 45 % and 35 % respectively, and a decrease in the % elongation and impact energy by 75 % and 32 %, respectively at 25 wt% carbonized bone, with 28 % increase in tensile strength at 15 wt% carbonized bone addition. The increase in strength and hardness values was attributed to the distribution of hard phases of bone particles in the ductile polypropylene matrix...|$|E
30|$|The present work aims at {{evaluation}} of the potential of cyanobacterial biomass to remove Cu(II) from simulated wastewater. Both dried and <b>carbonized</b> <b>forms</b> of Lyngbya majuscula, a cyanobacterial strain, {{have been used for}} such purpose. The influences of different experimental parameters viz., initial Cu(II) concentration, solution pH and adsorbent dose have been examined on sorption of Cu(II). Kinetic and equilibrium studies on Cu(II) removal from simulated wastewater have been done using both dried and carbonized biomass individually. Pseudo-second-order model and Langmuir isotherm have been found to fit most satisfactorily to the kinetic and equilibrium data, respectively. Maximum 87.99 and 99.15  % of Cu(II) removal have been achieved with initial Cu(II) concentration of 10 and 25  mg/L for dried and carbonized algae, respectively, at an adsorbent dose of 10  g/L for 20  min of contact time and optimum pH 6. To optimize the removal process, Response Surface Methodology has been employed using both the dried and carbonized biomass. Removal with initial Cu(II) concentration of 20  mg/L, with 0.25  g adsorbent dose in 50  mL solution at pH 6 {{has been found to be}} optimum with both the adsorbents. This is the first ever attempt to make a comparative study on Cu(II) removal using both dried algal biomass and its activated carbon. Furthermore, regeneration of matrix was attempted and more than 70 % and 80 % of the adsorbent has been regenerated successfully in the case of dried and carbonized biomass respectively upto the 3 rd cycle of regeneration study.|$|E

30|$|Dalbergia sissoo pods, a {{lignocellulosic}} nitrogenous waste biomass, {{was evaluated}} for sequestering of Cr(VI) from synthetic wastewater. Dalbergia sissoo pods (DSP) {{were used in}} three different forms, viz. natural (DSPN), impregnated {{in the form of}} hydrated beads (DSPB), and in <b>carbonized</b> <b>form</b> (DSPC) for comparative studies. Batch experiments were performed for the removal of hexavalent chromium. Effects of pH adsorbent dose, initial metal-ion concentration, stirring speed, and contact time were investigated. The removal of metal ions was dependent on the physico-chemical characteristics of the adsorbent, adsorbate concentration, and other studied process parameters. Maximum metal removal for Cr(VI) was observed at pH 2.0. The experimental data were analyzed based on Freundlich and Langmuir adsorption isotherms. Kinetic studies indicated that the adsorption of metal ions followed a pseudo-second-order equation.|$|R
30|$|To {{establish}} {{the mechanism of}} Cu(II) removal using algal adsorbents, kinetic study was done. A stock solution of Cu(II) (1000  mg/L) was prepared by dissolving definite amount of CuSO 4 · 5 H 2 O (AR grade, MERCK) in distilled water. Various concentrations of Cu(II) were prepared from the stock solution by diluting it with suitable amount of distilled water. Pre-weighted adsorbents (dried and carbonized) prepared from algal biomass were added separately to each flask containing 50  mL of metal solution and agitated in a BOD incubator with shaker (Make Digitech, India) at 35  ±  1  °C. Initially experiments were conducted for 60  min; however, no remarkable change in concentration was observed after 20  min. Therefore, during kinetic study, all the experiments were run for 20  min only. To assess Cu(II) removal, samples were collected at different time intervals. The solutions were then centrifuged at 5000  rpm for 10  min and supernatant was analyzed for Cu(II) concentration spectrophotometrically using UV–Visible Spectrophotometer (TECHCOM, UV 2300) at 460  nm (Greenberg et al. 1992). Sorption kinetics of Cu(II) by dried biomass and its <b>carbonized</b> <b>form</b> has been studied by varying three operating parameters viz., initial Cu(II) concentration (10 – 50  mg/L), solution pH (2 – 6) and adsorbent dose in a judicial manner. Sorption of Cu(II) is highly dependent on adsorbent dose. Initially sorption of Cu(II) was examined with different amount of dried biomass and its <b>carbonized</b> <b>form</b> separately and found that 0.5  g of carbonized biomass had similar capacity as that obtained with 1.0  g of dried biomass under identical condition. Therefore, during kinetic study, doses of dried algal biomass and carbonized biomass were varied individually from 0.1 to 1.0  g and from 0.1 to 0.5  g, respectively, and all other parameters were kept constant.|$|R

Particularly, a CO molecule release from carbonyl oxygen complexes {{in the presence of}} different oxygen environments was analyzed. Molecular carbonyl models of different sizes in the zigzag, armchair, and tip shapes of the active sites were selected. It was found that the shape of the local active site has a strong effect on the CO desorption energy, and they are correlated with the broaden feature of the CO molecule desorption in the temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments of oxidized carbonaceous material. The calculated desorption activation energy range is in good agreement with experimental data. Molecular size convergence analyses on the carbonyl models suggest that the smallest graphene molecular system for accurate desorption structure on char is a three-ring molecule. The activation energy and normal-mode analyses for selected carbonyl complexes suggest that carbonyl surface oxygen complexes are stable structures and that they can be considered as labile surface oxygen complexes.
