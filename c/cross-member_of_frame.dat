It had an unstepped planing bottom and was divided into several watertight compartments to keep the aircraft afloat even with fuselage damage. In an emergency over water the land undercarriage was jettisoned and the aircraft stabilised by a planing float on each side, mounted on the wing struts {{at the lower end}} of the jury struts. The land wheels were on a single axle, sprung from the <b>cross-member</b> <b>of</b> a <b>frame</b> formed by longitudinal V-struts from the lower fuselage and a transverse V from the same points to the centre <b>of</b> the <b>cross-member.</b> The pilot's open cockpit was under a wing trailing edge cut-out and was provided with a small, streamlined head-rest.

The original engine had a peak output of [...] at 2600 rpm. Although there was a conventional looking radiator it was a dummy.

Two <b>cross-members</b> <b>of</b> the <b>frame</b> supported at three points the assembled unit of engine and clutch and a three speed gearbox with reverse. The rear wheels were driven through a fabric joint and propellor shaft to a universal joint and an under-worm wheel type rear axle. A dynamo was belt driven from the propeller shaft. An electric starter was optional from 1923. [...] A six volt lighting set was provided.|$|R

40|$|One {{approach}} {{to ease the}} construction <b>of</b> <b>frames</b> is to first construct local components and then build a global frame from these. In this paper we will show {{that the study of}} the relation between a frame and its local components leads to the definition <b>of</b> a <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> subspaces. We introduce this new notion and prove that it provides us with the link we need. It will also turn out that <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> subspaces behave as a generalization <b>of</b> <b>frames.</b> In particular, we can define an analysis, a synthesis and a frame operator for a <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> subspaces, which even yield a reconstruction formula. Also concepts such as completeness, minimality, and exactness are introduced and investigated. We further study several constructions <b>of</b> <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> subspaces, and also <b>of</b> <b>frames</b> and Riesz frames using the theory <b>of</b> <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> subspaces. An important special case are harmonic <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> subspaces which generalize harmonic frames. We show that wavelet subspaces coming from multiresolution analysis belong to this class.

Also, it should be rigid enough to withstand the shock, twist, vibration and other stresses. Along with strength, {{an important}} consideration in chassis design is to have adequate bending stiffness for better handling characteristics. So, maximum stress, maximum equilateral stress and deflection are important criteria for the design of the chassis. This project is the work performed towards the optimization of the automotive chassis with constraints of maximum shear stress, equivalent stress and deflection of chassis under maximum load.

40|$|The rate {{at which}} frames are {{rendered}} in a computer game directly impacts player performance, influencing both the game playability and enjoyability. However, despite the importance <b>of</b> <b>frame</b> rate and the wide-spread popularity of computer games, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, there is little quantitative understanding of the effects <b>of</b> <b>frame</b> rate on player performance in computer games. This paper provides a unique classification of actions in First Person Shooter (FPS) games based on interaction requirements that allow qualitative assessment of the impact <b>of</b> <b>frame</b> rates on player performance. This qualitative assessment is supported by quantitative analysis from two large user studies that measure the effects <b>of</b> <b>frame</b> rate on the fundamental player actions in a FPS game. Nearly 100 users participated in the two user study experiments, providing performance and perception data over a range <b>of</b> <b>frame</b> rates commonly studied for video streaming and inclusive <b>of</b> <b>frame</b> rates found in many computer game platforms. In general, the analysis shows that actions that require precise, rapid response, such as shooting, are greatly impacted by degradations in frame rates, while actions with lower precision and response requirements, such as moving, are more tolerant <b>of</b> low <b>frame</b> rates. These insights into the effects <b>of</b> <b>frame</b> rates on player performance can guide players in their choice for game settings and new hardware purchases, and inform system designers in their development of new hardware...|$|R
