Her speeches included one to the Royal Society on 27 September 1988 and to the UN General Assembly in November 1989.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to reveal the {{relationship}} between 1) the variables of position and working age of each objective and 2) responses variables on organizational environmental <b>protection</b> <b>climate</b> of an organizational climate in a rubber products factory located in North China.

Unlike human teeth, which are composed mostly of enamel on {{the portion of}} the tooth outside of the gum, whale teeth have cementum outside the gum. Porpoises, like other odontocetes, possess only one blowhole. Breathing involves expelling stale air from the blowhole, forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs. All porpoises have a thick layer of blubber. This blubber can help with insulation from the harsh underwater <b>climate,</b> <b>protection</b> to some extent as predators {{would have a hard time}} getting through a thick layer of fat, and energy for leaner times.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In many {{countries}} with fair-skinned populations, skin cancer is major health problem. Over-exposure to UV radiation {{is a leading}} cause. Along {{with the use of}} sun-screen, environmental shade is a recognised strategy in reducing UV exposure. In temperate <b>climates</b> <b>protection</b> from UV is often required when the warmth of sun is desired for comfort. The use of opaque shading materials can form spaces that are too cool for comfort. This is especially relevant at outdoor swimming pools were people often relax by sun-bathing. Some transparent and translucent materials transmit the sun’s warmth while shielding UV. Assuming diffuse UV can be controlled, a laminated glass sun-shade structure could allow people to enjoying sun-bathing safely without the risk of sun-burn. This paper presents a case study of a recently constructed glass clad sun-shade structure at an outdoor swimming pool in Wellington, New Zealand. The preliminary shading design study is presented as well as the results of a study of UV protection and thermal comfort performance of the built structure...|$|R
