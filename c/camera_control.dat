5|$|Moving {{from the}} PlayStation Portable to the PlayStation 3 allowed the {{development}} team {{to add more}} details to the character designs, additional atmospheric sounds, as well as slightly tweak the gameplay system, now allowing <b>camera</b> <b>control</b> with the right analog stick. In addition, the Mirage Arena (a multiplayer component from the original game) has been reworked to only be a single-player experience. Yasue said enemy strengths and AI in the arena were adjusted to account for this. The inclusion of the Final Mix version in the collection {{marked the first time}} for this version to be released outside Japan.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario Sunshine {{received}} critical acclaim, with reviewers {{praising the}} game's graphics, Mario's array of moves, {{and the addition}} of FLUDD as a mechanic, though some critics criticized the game's <b>camera</b> <b>control.</b> The game was also a commercial success, selling 5.5 million copies worldwide as of 2006, and is the 3rd best-selling GameCube game of all time. The game was re-released as a Player's Choice title in 2003.|$|E

5|$|A {{remake of}} Conker's Bad Fur Day, titled , was {{ultimately}} released for the Xbox in 2005 to generally favourable critical reception. Developers {{noted that it}} was difficult to port the game to the Xbox system because Bad Fur Days microcoded performance optimisations had been deeply customised for the Nintendo 64 hardware. Conker: Live & Reloaded features updated graphics and a multiplayer mode that supports the Xbox Live service. Additionally, some aspects in the single-player mode were adjusted: several minor obscenities within the voice dialogue that are present in the Nintendo 64 game were censored at Microsoft's request, the <b>camera</b> <b>control</b> was refined and improved with a zoom function, and an auto-targeting system was added to the game.|$|E
5|$|Studio Ghibli's Yoshiyuki Momose {{served as}} the {{director}} of animation, drawing character designs and storyboards. Hino wished Dominion of the Dark Djinn and Wrath of the White Witch to have a heartwarming feel; the artwork and character movements was greatly inspired by Studio Ghibli's work, particularly due to their attention to detail, as well as their talent in creating storyboards and utilizing <b>camera</b> <b>control.</b> The development team constantly watched Studio Ghibli's films during development. The team wanted the theme of the game to resonate with children; they initially considered the idea of expressing adventure and dreams. They later explored the concept of a child's greatest influence, their mother, and the possibility of losing them. The game's main playable character, Oliver, is a 13-year-old boy. The team decided to make him a child as they wished to showcase a coming of age story. They wanted children to empathize with Oliver's development, and adults to relive the excitement of their adolescence.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd Birthday {{was created}} as a {{conceptual}} rebirth for Aya's character, {{as well as a}} means of re-introducing her to the gaming community, with it being over a decade since the last game in the series. Among the staff were Hajime Tabata, Yoshinori Kitase, Motomu Toriyama, Isamu Kamikokuryo, and Aya's original designer Tetsuya Nomura. Originally announced as an episodic title for mobile phones, the game was later changed into a PSP exclusive. Upon release, the game reached sixth place in Japanese sales charts, and was among the top five games in North American and UK sales charts during its opening months. Reviews have been mixed; critics praised the presentation and several parts of the gameplay, while opinions were mixed about the story, and many cited difficulties with <b>camera</b> <b>control</b> and some of the shooter mechanics. Several reviewers have also made negative comments on Aya's portrayal.|$|E

5|$|The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword is an action-adventure {{video game}} in which players take {{on the role of}} series protagonist Link through a series of overworlds {{populated}} by monsters and navigating dungeons featuring puzzles and further enemies including dedicated bosses. Link is controlled using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, and the Wii MotionPlus expansion device is required to play. The greater majority of gameplay mechanics revolve around use of motion controls: these include <b>camera</b> <b>control</b> with the Nunchuck and general hotkey actions and movement linked to the Wii Remote. Jumping across gaps and scaling ledges happen automatically within context. The Nunchuck is also used to make Link perform a forward roll. In addition to his standard pace, Link can sprint for short distances. Sprinting and other actions such as climbing and carrying heavy objects is limited by a stamina meter, which recharges after a few seconds when not performing actions that drain it. When depleted entirely, Link's movement speed is reduced and he is left vulnerable until the meter refills. Standard navigation takes place from a third-person perspective, while the Dowsing search function switches to a first-person view: Dowsing scans an area for a selected object, with new Dowsing objectives appearing depending on game context.|$|E
5|$|Development on Crash: Mind over Mutant began {{immediately}} {{after the completion of}} Crash of the Titans. The idea of preserving a titan for later use came from the play testing sessions of Crash of the Titans, in which the testers were found to be reluctant to leave the titans behind after an epic battle was won. Fans of the series were also a source of inspiration for Crash: Mind over Mutant, having such wishes as a free-roaming environment, Coco Bandicoot being a playable character and the return of the character Doctor Nitrus Brio. Full <b>camera</b> <b>control</b> was considered for the game, but was rejected for graphical reasons and to avoid having to insert a split-screen view in the cooperation mode. Online gameplay was also considered as a feature in the finished game, but was omitted due to the brief development schedule. Coco Bandicoot as a playable character was omitted from the PlayStation 2 version of the game due to her distinct animations taking up much of the console's memory. The Wii version of Crash: Mind over Mutant was created first, with the graphics scaled up for the Xbox 360, and scaled down for the PlayStation 2. A PlayStation 3 version of the game was rumored, but was promptly debunked by Radical Entertainment as a mistake on many press sites' behalf.|$|E
5|$|Type-0 HD was {{released}} on March 17, 19 and 20, 2015 for North America, Japan and Europe respectively. It came with both English and Japanese voice tracks for all regions. The game included a demo of Final Fantasy XV, titled Final Fantasy XV: Episode Duscae. The demo was only available in limited quantities: it was exclusive to physical first-print editions, and came with the digital edition for two months after release. The collector's edition, available through Square Enix's online store and at Amazon.com, came with a special CD featuring tracks from Type-0 and Agito, a calendar featuring official artwork, a Vermillion Peristylium ID card, a set of five cards modeled after those used by Ace in battle, and a cadet scarf. Limited editions of the game were produced for North America and Europe, for sale at selected high street and online stores. A PlayStation 4 hardware bundle was also produced for Japan, featuring {{a copy of the}} game and download code for the XV demo along with a console themed after the game. A port to Microsoft Windows via Valve Corporation's Steam platform was developed. This port was created in response to fan demands for a PC version. In contrast to the console version, the PC port allowed graphic adjustments, and included fixes for <b>camera</b> <b>control</b> and motion blur issues raised by players and reviewers after release. The port {{was released}} on August 18, 2015. As part of the promotion for the port, Final Fantasy-themed pre-order gifts for use in Dota 2 were created.|$|E

5|$|Type-0 was {{released}} on October 27, 2011, receiving both physical and digital releases. It was initially announced for release in summer of that year, but unspecified difficulties with development including the stoppage of PlayStation Network caused a delay. It was then announced for released on October 13, but was delayed by two weeks. While Square Enix stated it wanted to improve its quality, no other information was given. It was speculated {{to be due to}} complaints surrounding the <b>camera</b> <b>control</b> and other gameplay elements. The releases of the soundtrack and the theme song were also delayed. Type-0 was one of a few releases for the PSP to be released on two UMDs, as Tabata wanted to cut as little content as possible, which would have been impossible if they had settled for using one UMD. A demo for the original game {{was released}} in August 2011, featuring seven playable characters and four missions at locked difficulty levels. Sava data could be transferred to the full game, unlocking special costumes and items and keeping experience points. A second demo {{was released on}} November 22, a month after the full game's release. It replaced the original demo and gave players access to exclusive items and costumes. A collector's edition was released exclusively through Square Enix's online store, containing artwork, a limited edition version of the soundtrack, postcards and a booklet of character introductions. The title was later added to their Ultimate Hits budget title collection.|$|E
25|$|The first {{attempts}} to bring platform games into 3D used 2D graphics and an isometric perspective. These games are nearly {{as old as}} the genre itself, one of the earliest examples being Sega's Congo Bongo in 1983. The first platformers to simulate a 3D perspective and moving camera emerged in the early-mid-1980s. An early example of this was Konami's platform game Antarctic Adventure, where the player controls a penguin in a forward-scrolling third-person perspective while having to jump over pits and obstacles. Originally released in 1983 for the MSX computer, it was subsequently ported to various platforms the following year, including an arcade version, NES, and ColecoVision. That same year, I, Robot, though not a platformer, featured filled 3D polygonal graphics, flat shading, and <b>camera</b> <b>control</b> options, which were not widely adopted by platformers until the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|The first Tomb Raider used a {{custom-built}} game engine, {{as other}} equivalent engines available to Core Design {{at the time}} were not versatile enough to realise the team's vision. The engine was designed by Paul Douglas, who also handled the game's artificial intelligence (AI) and the three-dimensional (3D) graphics. The choice of a 3D game was influenced by the team's opinion that the game type was under-represented when compared to first-person shooters such as Doom. Its 3D style meant multiple elements were difficult to implement, including the AI and <b>camera</b> <b>control.</b> Another noted aspect was the multi-layered levels, as compared to equivalent 3D action-adventure games of the time which were limited to a flat-floor system. Lara's movements were hand-animated and coordinated rather than created using motion capture. The reason for this was that the team wanted uniformity in her movement, which was not possible with motion capture technology of the time. For Tomb Raider II, only minor upgrades were made to the engine, with the main improvements being to the AI and smoothing out Lara's model. Tomb Raider III underwent major revisions, including rewrites to the graphics engine and improvements in the lighting and AI systems. The engine was given a major overhaul for The Last Revelation. The first five games make use of full-motion video cutscenes. For the first three games, they were primarily used as transitional periods depicting Lara moving from one level to another or one location to another. For Chronicles, fairly minor revisions were made.|$|E

500|$|The PS2 port {{was not as}} well {{received}} by reviewers, with a lower aggregate score of 70 out of 100, indicating [...] "mixed or average reviews". The graphics of the port were considered by reviewers to be {{not as good as}} the PSP release and other installments in the series for the PS2. Conversely, a reviewer for GameZone wrote that despite some technical issues with the graphics, the visuals of the port sufficed. Other issues with the port commented on by critics include the lack of manual <b>camera</b> <b>control,</b> the absence of a mini-map or overall map for the more challenging areas, and no new bonus material for the port.|$|E
500|$|While much of {{the prior}} work in {{automated}} virtual <b>camera</b> <b>control</b> systems has been directed towards reducing {{the need for a}} human to manually control the camera, the Director's Lens solution computes and proposes a palette of suggested virtual camera shots leaving the human operator to make the creative shot selection. [...] In computing subsequent suggested virtual camera shots, the system analyzes the visual compositions and editing patterns of prior recorded shots to compute suggested camera shots that conform to continuity conventions such as not crossing the line of action, match placement of virtual characters so they appear to look at one another across cuts, and favors those shots which the human operator had previously used in sequence.|$|E
500|$|The game {{received}} critical acclaim, with {{reviews from}} video game news websites typically praising its gameplay innovations, action, visuals, <b>camera</b> <b>control,</b> and gothic ambience.

500|$|Many reviewers {{cited the}} game's unusual setting as the {{counterbalance}} to the mediocre gameplay, repetitive environments and poor <b>camera</b> <b>control.</b> Overall, {{the first game}} was moderately well received, with reviewers overlooking gameplay flaws because of a compelling story. Christian Nutt of GameSpy awarded if four stars out of five and commended Bandai for breaking new ground and Cyber Connect 2 for providing an engrossing RPG experience. Gary Steinman of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine wrote, [...] "t its core, [...]hack {{is not a good}} game", calling the battle systems [...] "wildly unbalanced" [...] and the graphics [...] "spectacularly underwhelming", but said the [...] "mind-bending" [...] story allowed him to look past its obvious flaws and anticipate future games in the series. Greg Kasavin of GameSpot was less forgiving, deriding [...]hack//Infection as a sub-par version of Kingdom Hearts.|$|E
500|$|GamePro did {{not find}} the game worthy of its name, {{although}} the cutscenes were praised, stating, [...] "The cinemas {{at the opening of}} the game and between each level are stunning; however, the game graphics, particularly buildings and enemies, are lackluster at best. The sound effects are bland, and there are no weapon power-ups to be found. Put that all together and you get a very generic game." [...] Next Generation criticized the game for being tedious, but recognized that it is still an enjoyable game. Computer and Video Games offered similar criticism, declaring that [...] "it was too repetitive to become anything more than a good game." [...] Edge criticized the gameplay features such as <b>camera</b> <b>control</b> and boss difficulty. Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewers criticized the game for its easy bosses and its repetitive and short gameplay value. Famitsu liked the battles but complained about the Fuchikoma attaching to walls when not intended.|$|E
