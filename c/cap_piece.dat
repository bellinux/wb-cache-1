5000|$|The Power ROK-Lift is a Rokenbok {{accessory}} {{which is}} used to take a large load of ROKs up at to a high point of a Rokenbok build. The ROK-Lift has a plate on the front as a button to operate an elevating mechanism similar to the RC Elevator. The mechanism contains gears which ride along a Rokenbok piece called [...] "Elevator Racks" [...] with grooved edges designed for the ROK Lift and the RC Elevator. An RC vehicle dumps ROKs into a storage bin {{on either side of the}} lift module, then bumps into the button to start the elevating motion; once the module reaches a <b>cap</b> <b>piece,</b> the bins automatically dump into a receiving container or chute, and the module returns to the bottom.|$|E
5000|$|The town of Greenwood {{was settled}} in the late 19th century and {{incorporated}} in 1816, roughly organized around three large land grants. It was an agricultural area, and {{like many of the}} period, the issue of stray livestock was a significant one. In 1835, the town voted to approve the construction of an animal pound [...] "forty feet Square inside", with walls [...] "five feet high with A Wooden <b>Cap</b> <b>piece,</b> ... well hewed and well put on"; this structure was apparently complete the following year. The site selected was located just north of what was then the civic center of the town. Greenwood City, as that area was known, was almost completely destroyed by fire in 1862, and the economic and civic focus of the town shifted to Locke Mills, where textile mills and the railroad were located. The pound's importance declined after the invention of barbed wire made the fencing of pasturage economically feasible, and no pound masters are recorded after 1871. Greenwood's agrarian economy started to give way to recreational activities {{around the turn of the}} 20th century.|$|E
5000|$|The {{building}} has a fanciful steep pitch terracotta tiled roof with sprocketted eaves and projecting gables {{to the east}} and west. Three turrets, to the centre, and the north and south bays, have been formed by the ridge being deleted between them and a curved <b>capping</b> <b>piece</b> inserted. The centre turret has a [...] "pot bellied", sheet metal roof ventilator, the other two have rounded finials.|$|R
50|$|The {{retaining}} wall stepping {{down from the}} southern {{side of the bridge}} supports flights of stairs alternating with gentle ramps. The stonework is finished to the profile of the stairs and ramps and capped with concrete. The capping, in turn, supports a balustrade of solid concrete panels spanning between stonework piers. Like the piers on the bridge itself, these consist of Brisbane Tuff ashlaring with a bevelled <b>capping</b> <b>piece.</b>|$|R

Sometimes also {{referred}} to as the: Baker Boy, Bandit Cap, Apple <b>Cap,</b> Eight <b>Piece</b> <b>Cap,</b> Eight Panel, Cabbie, Jay Gatsby (from The Great Gatsby), Fisherman's Cap, Pageboy, Applejack Hat, Lundberg Stetson, Chiz Hat and the Poor Boy Cap.|$|R
50|$|For the 2015-16 Formula E season Félix da Costa {{retained}} {{his seat}} with Team Aguri but had several good races {{taken away from}} his due to unreliability. For the first 3 races of the season he raced alongside Nathanaël Berthon before the French driver was dropped in favor of season 1 driver Salvador Durán, who himself was replaced by Ma Qinghua just 3 races later in to the season. Due to DTM commitments da Costa was unable to race the 2016 Berlin ePrix and was himself replaced by René Rast for the race, he would return for the double header to end the season in London. Da Costa's best finish of the season was 6th place which he achieved 3 times, at Putrajaya, Punta del Este and London(1). During the 2015 Beijing ePrix he was running in the podium positions when the car had a mechanical failure putting {{him out of the}} ePrix. At the 2016 Buenos Aires ePrix he was going for a potential back to back win at the track when another car failure, this time a safety <b>cap</b> <b>piece,</b> put him out of the race. Again bad luck would strike the Portuguese driver at the 2016 Long Beach ePrix when he claimed a sensational pole position only to be disqualified due to his right rear tyre pressure being 0.3psi below minimum. At the 2016 London ePrix for race 2 da Costa finished an impressive 4th only to have a penalty for using too much power demote him to 9th, then a second penalty for track limits down to 11th. When the season had finished, Motorsport.com placed him 4th overall in the top 10 drivers of the season due to keeping cool at all times even when faced with so much bad luck.|$|E
5000|$|According to {{most other}} accounts, {{the source of}} the wing {{failures}} lay not in the design, but in shoddy and rushed construction. Fokker had subcontracted construction of the E.V wings to the Gebrüder Perzina Pianoforte Fabrik factory. Due to poor quality control, inferior timber had been used and the spar [...] "caps", forming the upper and lower members of each spar assembly, had been placed too far apart during the fabrication. Because the resulting spars were vertically too large to pass through the ribs, excess material was simply planed away from the exposed upper and lower surfaces of the <b>cap</b> <b>pieces,</b> leaving the assembled spars dangerously weak. Other problems included water damage to glued parts, and pins that splintered the spars, rather than securing them.|$|R

500|$|Parts of the Air Tractor {{are already}} known to exist: The Australian Antarctic Division has one wheel from the frame, and its ice-rudder – {{both of which}} were found in the harbour. [...] In January 2009 the remains of a seat from the air-tractor were found in rocks near the hut, about [...] from where the team {{believes}} the frame to be buried. On 1 January 2010, a day of unusually low tide, 4 small <b>capping</b> <b>pieces</b> from the end section of the tail were found by the edge of the harbour. The tail and a section of fuselage had been removed {{from the rest of the}} air-tractor before it was abandoned in 1913, therefore this discovery did not shed much light on the location of the rest of the frame, but it suggests that [...] "the frame, or parts of it, can survive for nearly 100years in this environment".|$|R
50|$|At {{some point}} {{it appears that}} the main flow of Glengallan Creek became {{diverted}} down Backwater Creek, for what reason is not known. By 1892 three dams had been constructed on Glengallan Creek to provide irrigation to the paddocks. Water was still being pumped from the creek in the 1890s, but by the early 1900s water was being supplied by a bore on the northwest of Mt Marshall to a holding tank near the woolshed, and the house water system was reliant on rain water. The original timber shingles to the roof of Glengallan were sheeted over with corrugated iron and stormwater drainage was introduced. Pipes were installed at both the northwest and southwest corners of the house, with the northwest pipe feeding into the stone lined channel that runs along the west side of house with sandstone <b>capping</b> <b>pieces.</b> Pipes also fed into the roof tank.|$|R

50|$|Built to an L-shaped {{plan the}} outer faces {{of which are}} {{oriented}} {{to the north and}} east, Fassifern Homestead has a bungalow-style hipped roof clad in corrugated iron. The southern projection of the L ends in a half-hip centred beneath which is a small gabled porch with timber framing, later lattice infill, and timber stairs. Two brick chimneystacks (one of which is a double chimney) pierce the roof ridge running parallel with the north-facing wing of the house. Four decorative sheet metal roof ventilators straddle the two roof ridges, two along each line. They consist of two cylinders surmounted by an overhanging low-pitched cone with a highly decorative edge and <b>capping</b> <b>piece.</b> Timber-framed, with exterior walls clad variously with two widths of chamferboard and weatherboards, the house is raised off the gently sloping ground on ant-capped timber stumps. The spaces between the perimeter stumps have been in-filled with painted, slatted timber screens.|$|R

50|$|M. rubi is {{a solitary}} bee species and nests in {{holes in the}} ground. Holes are {{excavated}} by the female at an angle of 20° to 45° from the horizontal and then level out underground. A small spoil heap of sandy material is thrown up near the entrance. The female constructs one or more cells in the burrow. Each cell is lined with pieces of cut leaf, the sweet birch (Betula lenta) being used in some instances. Each cell has 2 to 6 rounded base pieces, 8 to 14 rectangular side pieces forming several layers round the perimeter, and 2 to 6 rounded <b>cap</b> <b>pieces.</b> Each leaf portion is carefully cut {{and in the case}} of the side pieces, the portions forming the inner layers are smaller than the outer ones. The leaf-lined cell is two-thirds filled with a pollen and nectar mix and an egg is laid at one side before the cap is placed in position. In multi-cell nests, the next cell adjoins the previous one, end to end. Blister beetles (Lytta sp.) sometimes lay their eggs in the cell as parasites. When the last cell is capped and the nest is complete, the female drags sandy soil back into the burrow from the spoil heap, plugging the entrance.|$|R

A similar doorway is located in the centre under the internal staircase, but the door is missing. These doors are accessed by rough sandstone steps and a timber ramp, and a stone lined stormwater drain is located in front of and running parallel to this wall. A tall sash window is located above the central door, with a smaller sash to either side. This symmetrical elevation has two chimney stacks which have picked-faced sandstone to the base, and smooth-faced sandstone above surmounted by a large cornice with curved <b>capping</b> <b>pieces.</b> The western wall has marks in the sandstone above the northern door which indicate the roof profile of the covered way which was originally located connected there.Internally, the building has a symmetrical plan with a central hall and stairwell flanked by the former dining room on the north and former drawing room on the south. The first floor has a bedroom at either end, separated from the stairwell by an ante room and linked by a short hallway. The plaster finishes are thought to be original, but have suffered much water damage.|$|R
