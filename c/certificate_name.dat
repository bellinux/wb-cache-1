5000|$|A typical basic ("class 1") {{personal}} certificate verifies the owner's [...] "identity" [...] {{only insofar as}} it declares that the sender {{is the owner of}} the [...] "From:" [...] email address {{in the sense that the}} sender can receive email sent to that address, and so merely proves that an email received really did come from the [...] "From:" [...] address given. It does not verify the person's name or business name. If a sender wishes to enable email recipients to verify the sender's identity in the sense that a received <b>certificate</b> <b>name</b> carries the sender's name or an organization's name, the sender needs to obtain a certificate ("class 2") from a CA who carries out a more in-depth identity verification process, and this involves making inquiries about the would-be certificate holder.

40|$|Transport Layer Security (TLS) is {{a mature}} {{cryptographic}} protocol, but has flexibility during implementation which can introduce exploitable flaws. New vulnerabilities are routinely discovered {{that affect the}} security of TLS implementations. We discovered that discrete logarithm implementations have poor parameter validation, and we mathematically constructed a deniable backdoor to exploit this flaw in the finite field Diffie-Hellman key exchange. We described attack vectors an attacker could use to position this backdoor, and outlined a man-in-the-middle attack that exploits the backdoor to force Diffie-Hellman use during the TLS connection. We conducted an Internet-wide survey of ephemeral finite field Diffie-Hellman (DHE) across TLS and STARTTLS, finding hundreds of potentially backdoored DHE parameters and partially recovering the private DHE key in some cases. Disclosures were made to companies using these parameters, resulting in a public security advisory and discussions with the CTO of a billion-dollar company. We conducted a second Internet-wide survey investigating X. 509 <b>certificate</b> <b>name</b> mismatch errors, finding approximately 70 million websites invalidated by these errors and additionally discovering over 1000 websites made inaccessible due {{to a combination of}} forced HTTPS and mismatch errors. We determined that name mismatch errors occur largely due to certificate mismanagement by web hosting and content delivery network companies. Further research into TLS implementations is necessary to encourage the use of more secure parameters...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This study {{compares the}} {{prevalence}} of high neonatal risk among very-low-birth-weight babies (VLBW) referred to North Carolina’s Infant/Toddler Program and those VLBW babies not referred to the program. The study also compares demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of mothers with VLBW babies referred and not referred to the program. Methods: The sample {{for this study was}} obtained from the North Carolina Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS). The study design incorporates a case-control approach. High neonatal risk includes birth weight {{less than or equal to}} 800 grams, gestational age less than or equal to 28 weeks, and extended infant hospitalization after birth (75 + days). For the study period, July 1997 through December 1999, there were 616 VLBW PRAMS babies. The case group consisted of 200 of these infants whose birth <b>certificate</b> <b>name</b> and date of birth matched to the Infant/Toddler service records, leaving 416 infants in the control or non-Infant/Toddler group. Results: No significant demographic differences were found among mothers with VLBW babies in the Infant/Toddler and non-Infant/Toddler groups. The prevalence rates for extreme low birth weight, extreme preterm birth, and extended infant hospitalization after birth were all significantly higher in the Infant/Toddler group. Among the four low socioeconomic indicators, two were significantly elevated in the Infant/Toddler group: Medicaid payment for prenatal care and annual household income below $ 12, 000. Conclusion: The study confirms that high neonatal risk is strongly associated with an infant being referred to North Carolina’s Infant/Toddler program. Monitoring program coverage rates for extremely low birth weight and extremely preterm babies over time will help assess program efforts to enhance coverage of this high risk population...|$|E

40|$|This Article answers {{questions}} {{created by}} the financing statement requirements for sufficiency {{of the name of}} an individual debtor under the amendments to Uniform Commercial Code Article 9 —Secured Transactions. An individual debtor in a security interest transaction could be known by various names: birth <b>certificate</b> <b>name,</b> driver’s license name, passport name, or nickname. Revised Article 9 provides no guidance on what name is the correct name of the debtor for entry on the financing statement, and a financing statement that does not provide the correct name of the debtor does not perfect the security interest. To resolve this problem, the Joint Review Committee for Article 9 considered possible amendments to the individual debtor name requirements. Even the Joint Review Committee struggled with the issue, finally adopting two alternatives for sufficiency of the name of an individual debtor and asking states to choose between them. The Uniform Law Commission and the American Law Institute accepted the proposal and have offered the alternatives to the states, along with other amendments to Article 9. The proposed effective date of the amendments to Article 9 is July 1, 2013. To date, most states have adopted Alternative A to section 9 - 503 (a) (4) of amended Article 9. It is known as the “only if” rule. In accordance with this rule, a financing statement is sufficient only if it provides the name of the individual debtor as indicated on the debtor’s unexpired driver’s license. However, a secured party complying with section 9 - 503 (a) (4) Alternative A could still face many questions regarding the debtor’s name. This Article asks and answers twenty such questions. The Article also examines the statutory requirements of section 9 - 503 (a) (4) Alternative A and how a filed financing statement that does not satisfy those requirements could nevertheless remain effective...|$|E
40|$|The {{land title}} {{transfer}} {{is defined as}} every legal act which meant to transfer the ownership of the land to anyone or any corporate entity. Trading Land {{is one of many}} ways to do it. The habit of trading land nowadays is expected to be able to ensure legal certainty through the land title transfer. Buyers who already have the deed made by Land Title Registrar. Thus the buyer who has become the legal owner can immediately register their land at the Local Land Office. Considering the importance of legal certainty in every land title transfer as the result of trading land, therefore The Agrarian Land Act obliges to register the land title transfer due to trading. This research uses descriptive empirical method. Using secondary and primary data. The data are collected through library research and field study. And analyzed through normative qualitative method. Based on the research and discussion, it can be concluded that in the process of trading land there are 3 (three) phases which must be carried out. First, the preparation phase before the process of trading land. Second, the stage of making the deed. Third, the land title transfer of the traded land. There are some hindrances in the process of land title transfer, they are The Span of Standard Operational Procedure of The Land Title Transfer in which the deed is still in the form of Letter C from Urban Village; Trading of Hereditary Land; Incongruity between the Name in the Deed and the Seller; Tax Arrears to be Paid off; Queues At the National Land Agency (BPN).
