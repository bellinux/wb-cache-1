5|$|During the Industrial Revolution the Welsh woollen {{industry}} {{was slow to}} mechanize compared to the mills of northern England. When railways reached mid Wales in the 1860s they brought a flood of cheap mass-produced products that destroyed the local industry.

At one time {{there were more than}} 300 working wool mills. The industry went into steady decline after World War I, and only a few mills <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>operate.</b>|$|E
