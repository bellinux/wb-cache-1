The sea is more calm in the gorge, and {{it was better to}} take the boats from Múlagjógv up in the air, pulled by man power using the <b>cable</b> <b>way,</b> better than using the dangerous sea around Heltnarnar to Kleivin. The <b>cable</b> <b>way</b> {{was one of the reasons}} that the first electricity power plant in the Faroe Islands was made a few kilometers north of Vágseiði, on the other side of the mountain Gjógvárafjall in a place called Botn or Í Botni (In the Bottom). They wanted electricity for the <b>cable</b> <b>way</b> in order to drag the boats ashore.

The construction of the radio centre and the <b>cable</b> <b>way</b> as a whole was proposed by engineer Jānis Linters. When the construction of the whole <b>cable</b> <b>way</b> was finally commenced in 1932, 10 Latvian men were assigned to the Madona Radio Towers, with radio engineer Remberts Martinsons preparing the plans for the construction. In the same year, the <b>cable</b> <b>way</b> finally finished its half-a-year wide construction, with the Madona Radio Towers being the tallest. The towers were later on dismantled in July 1944 by the invading Nazi German soldiers during the second world war in the year 1944.|$|E

50|$|The park {{which is}} divided into three zones has a network of hiking trails. The National Park Service (NPS) {{maintains}} good information system about these trails. One such trail goes up the Mount Alava, a high peak within the park rising to a height of 491 m. A TV tower exists on this mountain and also the ruins of a cable car station of a 1.8 km long <b>cable</b> <b>way</b> which once ran over Pago Pago Harbor to Solo hill in Utulei. (524m). This <b>cable</b> <b>way,</b> which was the only single way cable in the world at that time built in 1965, was damaged when a Navy plane attempted to fly under it and was caught by one of the cables, on April 17, 1980 and was permanently put out of commission. The <b>cable</b> <b>way</b> was used to transport the TV technicians to the transmission station. The descent from the peak passes through lovely vistas of the lowlands of the park and the rain forests which abounds in several bird species. Another ridge trail runs from Fagasa Pass over a length of 6.5 km, goes through a very steep slopes behind the rest fale (hurricane shelter), which is also negotiated through a stairway and further leads down to the serene Vatia village on the coral bay.|$|E

Deserted, too, were the artificial gardens among the ruins. The city limits were indeed as sharply defined as in the ancient days when the gates were shut at nightfall and the robber foeman prowled to the very walls. A huge semi-circular throat poured out a vigorous traffic upon the Eadhamite Bath Road. So the first prospect of the world beyond the city flashed on Graham, and dwindled.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{experimental}} study of linear dynamic response a structure (Euler- Bernoulli beam) under a moving mass. The moving mass is constant in magnitude and moves at constant velocity. The dynamic analysis of beam is done by taking two different cases. In the first case effects of inertia of the load were neglect and in second case effects of the beam inertia were also not considered. The study of the moving load is a great importance {{in the field of}} transportation. Examples of the structural elements which support the moving masses are bridges, guide <b>ways,</b> overhead cranes, <b>cable</b> <b>ways,</b> railway, roadways, runways, tunnels and pipelines etc. in the first phase, dynamic equation of motion with the moving load for simply supported beam is solved by analytical method and then experimental analysis is given. In the present work, effect of moving mass on both simply supported and cantilever beam for two different materials is investigated. The effect of variation of parameters on dynamic response of Euler- Bernoulli beam is studied. The beam is divided into 20 stations and the deflection of beam at mid-span is recorded while mass moves at constant velocity through different stations. The deflection at mid-span for different station is taken with the help of oscilloscope. The result obtained is plotted in the form of graphs for different velocities of mass...|$|R

5000|$|The cyclone {{destroyed}} over 65% of {{the residential}} homes on American Samoa {{and even more}} on the Samoan islands of Upolu and Savai'i. Cyclone Val cut communications and power lines on the islands. It devastated fire stations, hospitals, government buildings, schools, and churches, particularly wooden buildings of the pre World War I colonial era. Cyclone Val destroyed over 80% of agricultural crops. One of the first areas hit was the Western Samoan island of Savai'i, which was described as looking like an atomic bomb had hit. A local remarked that [...] "there was no green, no buildings standing, no shelter; just total and complete devastation." [...] Cyclone Val {{was reported to have}} killed 17 people and left 4,000 people homeless in American Samoa alone. Cyclone Val was assessed to have had an impact 50% worse than Cyclone Ofa, costing about $50 million in damage and putting a severe strain on agricultural production and the livelihoods of farmers on the islands. In Fagatele Bay at Tutuila Island, where Cyclone Val made a direct pass, the coral reef was completely destroyed. A large strip of the coast was also eroded. In response to this disaster, the NOAA deputed an assessment team to survey the damage to the reefs. In Tutuila, which accounts for 68% of American Samoa, the funicular railway, the longest single span <b>cable</b> <b>way</b> in the world, was permanently put out of service by Cyclone Val. The cable had previously connected Pago Pago harbor with the TV tower erected on Mt. Alava (491m). The TV tower at Utulei, one of the three TV channels in Samoa, was completely ruined by Cyclone Val, resulting in it being cannibalized for parts to maintain the two remaining channels. The Fagalele Boys School, one of the oldest European-style buildings on the island in Leone, was destroyed by Cyclone Val. According to a report of Greenpeace mission, the airport of Western Samoa was also devastated.|$|E
50|$|Königstein is {{situated}} about 40 km southeast of Dresden in the Elbe Sandstone Mountains. Königstein castle {{is one of}} the major attractions in this touristic area. Exploration for uranium started in the early 1960s for sandstone hosted uranium mineralisation similar to the ones discovered further south in the Czech Republic. Finally a major mineralisation was discovered in 1963, hosted by Cretaceous sandstones with disseminated uranium minerals in Rollfront-type ore bodies. However, there are also small veins containing barite and pitchblende and the nature of this deposit is under discussion. Most likely it is a combination of a sedimentary style and hydrothermal mineralisation. Construction of the mine started immediately after the discovery and two main shaft along with several ventilation shafts were sunk to depths up to 300 m. Mining started in 1967 and it developed into one of the main producers of SDAG Wismut in the 1970s, with more than 1,000 tonnes of uranium per year in this decade. The ore mined was transported by a <b>cable</b> <b>way</b> down to the Elbe river valley from where it was transported by rail to the mill at Seelingstädt. Besides conventional mining using drilling, blasting and transport of the ore to the mill, already in 1969 studies were started on unconventional production methods for low grade ore using leaching. The low permeability of the sandstone prevented usual in-situ leaching from drillings. Therefore, different methods were developed to blast the ore underground, seal the blasted blocks, and press sulphuric acid into them. Heap leaching was also carried out as well as uranium extraction from mine water before it was released into the Elbe River. In 1984 conventional ore production ceased and only unconventional methods were used from that year on. Production sunk to about 450 tonnes uranium per year, but the Königstein mining division produced at the lowest costs of all Wismut mining divisions. The uranium bearing solution from leaching was transported by rail to the Seelingstädt mill where the final concentrate was produced. Total production of uranium until 1990 was about 18,000 tonnes, with 12,250 tonnes by conventional mining and 5,750 tonnes by unconventional methods.|$|E
