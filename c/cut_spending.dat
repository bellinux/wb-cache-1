5|$|Paul {{held one}} of his {{numerous}} press conferences in Helena, Montana, where he pushed for the Reagan administration {{to balance the budget}} and <b>cut</b> <b>spending</b> and taxes. He argued that Reagan had reneged on his 1980 campaign promise to balance the budget, resulting in voter dissatisfaction. Paul stated that Treasury Secretary James Baker should be removed from his office for the administration's monetary policy.|$|E
5|$|The state legislature, {{with the}} governor's support, <b>cut</b> <b>spending</b> by $1.6billion, {{including}} $700million in reductions in state aid to cities and towns. The cuts {{also included a}} $140million reduction in state funding for higher education, which led state-run colleges and universities to increase fees by 63percent over four years. Romney sought additional cuts in his last year as governor by vetoing nearly 250items in the state budget; a heavily Democratic legislature overrode all the vetoes.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} half of Letcher's term, the state was still {{struggling}} to recover from the financial Panic of 1837. Consistent with his Whig views, Letcher blamed the crisis on the federal government's failure to recharter the Second Bank of the United States. To ameliorate the state's dire financial situation, Letcher drastically <b>cut</b> <b>spending,</b> including the suspension of turnpike construction and improvements on the Green, Kentucky, and Licking rivers. These actions greatly reduced the state's deficit and improved its credit. In each of Letcher's years in office, the state showed a small but growing budget surplus.|$|E

5|$|Randall's {{determination}} to <b>cut</b> <b>spending,</b> combined with Southern Democrats' desire to reduce federal power {{in their home}} states, led the House to pass an army appropriation bill with a rider that repealed the Enforcement Acts, which {{had been used to}} suppress the Ku Klux Klan. The Enforcement Acts, passed during Reconstruction over Democratic opposition, made it a crime to prevent someone from voting because of his race. Hayes was determined to preserve the law protecting black voters, and he vetoed the appropriation. The Democrats did not have enough votes to override the veto, but they passed a new bill with the same rider. Hayes vetoed this as well, and the process was repeated three times more. Finally, Hayes signed an appropriation without the rider, but Congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals, who were vital to the enforcement of the Enforcement Acts. The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were curtailed. Randall's role in the process was limited, but the Democrats' failure to force Hayes's acquiescence weakened his appeal as a potential presidential candidate in 1880.|$|E
25|$|During 1991 and 1992 Kirner {{took several}} {{decisions}} to cut {{government spending and}} raise revenue to some extent, however her government failed to <b>cut</b> <b>spending</b> in many areas including education. Most of the Kirner Government attempts to <b>cut</b> <b>spending</b> were actively opposed by trade unions and {{some members of the}} government. The interest bill alone was $3.5billion per year, the government sold off trains and trams and leased them back. Another decision was the sale of the state-owned State Bank of Victoria to the Commonwealth Bank in 1991.|$|E

50|$|The 1981 tax cuts, some of {{the largest}} in U.S. history, also eroded the revenue base of the federal {{government}} in the short-term.

25|$|Davis {{had tried}} to {{maintain}} a middle-of-the-road approach, but ultimately alienated many of the state's liberals who viewed him as too conservative and many conservatives who viewed him as too liberal.

Some critics attributed the proposal to the California Correctional Peace Officers Associations donations to Davis' re-election campaign.|$|E

In the spring of 1937, American industrial production exceeded that of 1929 and remained level until June 1937.

25|$|The {{value of}} the Australian pound {{remained}} tied to the pound sterling. Inflation in Australia thus increased, less than in Britain, but {{more than in the}} United States. The case for a central bank was increased by the need for the government to <b>cut</b> <b>spending</b> after the war to reduce its debt. Commonwealth Bank Governor Denison Miller had been arguing for the issue of Australian currency to be switched from the treasury to the bank, as it had more staff and more monetary knowledge.|$|E

25|$|The {{welfare system}} {{that had been}} growing rapidly since the 1970s could not be {{sustained}} with a falling GDP, lower employment and larger welfare payments. In 1994 the government budget deficit exceeded 15% of GDP. The response of the government was to <b>cut</b> <b>spending</b> and institute a multitude of reforms to improve Sweden's competitiveness.

25|$|In 2005, a {{state budget}} plan that <b>cut</b> <b>spending</b> on {{libraries}} a further five percent {{was passed in}} the Ohio House of Representatives, after being proposed by Ohio governor Bob Taft. The budget prompted the library to distribute flyers and hold rallies in Downtown Cincinnati, calling on the state to repeal the proposed cuts. The cuts resulted in a periodic hiring freeze, reductions in hours, branch and department closings, and the layoff of approximately forty librarians. Librarians responded by voting to join the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 1199 in 2006.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, Finland {{fell into}} a {{depression}} caused {{by a combination of}} economic overheating, fixed currency, depressed Western, Soviet, and local markets. Stock market and housing prices declined by 50%. The growth in the 1980s was based on debt and defaults started rolling in. GDP declined by 15% and unemployment increased from a virtual full employment to one fifth of the workforce. The crisis was amplified by trade unions' initial opposition to any reforms. Politicians struggled to <b>cut</b> <b>spending</b> and the public debt doubled to around 60% of GDP. Some 7–8% of GDP was needed to bail out failing banks and force banking sector consolidation. After devaluations the depression bottomed out in 1993.|$|E

To win the election, Schricker focused on his personal popularity rather than his connection to the party. He won the election by less than 4,000 votes and was the only Democrat elected in any statewide election. Republicans swept to power and took strong majorities in the General Assembly {{for the first time in}} 15 years.
