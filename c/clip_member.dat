Most people have {{a high degree of}} regularity in their movements (such as a daily commute), including repeated contacts with others possessing similar seasonal movement patterns. We argue that this behaviour can be exploited in connection selection, and outline a system for the identification of long-term companions and sources that have previously provided quality content, in order to maximise the successful receipt of content files. We utilise actual traces and existing mobility models to validate our approach, and show how consideration of the colocation history and the quality of previous data transfers leads to more successful sharing of content in realistic scenarios.

50|$|Whitwell {{has become}} renowned for the Paper Clips Project, a Holocaust {{memorial}} and educational project, that {{was carried out}} by children of the local middle school starting in 1998. A subsequent documentary was made about the children's achievement. This project started because students at the local middle school wanted to visually grasp how much six million was. The students started collecting paper clips, one for every Jewish individual that died in the Holocaust during World War II. This project soon attracted media attention and international support. Many Jewish notables sent paper <b>clips</b> representing lost <b>members</b> of their families. The children collected well over the number of paper clips they wanted (11 million, representing all noncombatant prisoners---Jew and Gentile---killed by the Nazis). The total collected number of paper clips now stands between ten and fifty million. This number is approximately equal to the total number of war deaths between 1939-1945. The rail car that appears in the movie is original rolling stock, actually used to transport Jews to the concentration camps. This rail car is located at the Whitwell Middle School. The Middle School routinely hosts Holocaust survivors as well as other guest speakers {{on the subject of the}} Holocaust.|$|R
