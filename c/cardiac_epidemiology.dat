Although primary cardiac tumours are extremely uncommon (various postmortem studies report rates between 0. 001 % and 0. 28 %), secondary tumours are not, and at least in theory, the heart can be metastasised by any malignant neoplasm able to spread to distant sites. In general, cardiac metastases {{are considered to be}} rare; however, when sought for, the incidence seems to be not as low as expected, ranging from 2. 3 % and 18. 3 %.

40|$|Abstract—Hypertension is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} risk factor for incident atrial fibrillation (AF). Recently, even high normal blood pressures (BPs) have been established as predictive of AF in women. We aimed to study the long-term impact of upper normal BP on incident AF in a population-based study of middle-aged men. From 1972 to 1975, 2014 healthy Norwegian men were included in a prospective cardiovascular survey and underwent a comprehensive clinical examination including standardized BP measurements. During up to 35 years of follow-up, 270 men were documented with AF by scrutinizing all hospital discharges. Risk estimations for incident AF were analyzed in quartiles of BP using multivariate adjusted Cox proportional hazards. Men with baseline systolic BP 140 mm Hg and upper normal BP 128 to 138 mm Hg had 1. 60 -fold (95 % CI 1. 15 – 2. 21) and 1. 50 -fold (1. 10 – 2. 03) risk of AF, respectively, compared with men with BP 128 mm Hg. Baseline diastolic BP 80 mm Hg increased the risk of incident AF 1. 79 -fold (95 % CI 1. 28 – 2. 59) compared with diastolic BP 80 mm Hg. When adjusting for the occurrence of diabetes mellitus or cardiovascular diseases before an AF event, the results still maintained significance. Additional analyses, on average 7 years after baseline, including men still healthy, showed that sustained upper normal systolic BP remained {{a significant predictor of}} subsequent AF. In conclusion, upper normal blood pressures are long-term predictors of incident AF in initially healthy middle-aged men.

40|$|Sarcoidosis is a {{systemic}} disease of unknown aetiology characterised by {{the formation of}} noncaseating epitheloid cell granulomas, which can occur in virtually any organ. Cardiac involvement is of critical importance, due to the poor prognosis if this organ manifestation is left undiagnosed and untreated. Early initiation of therapy seems {{to be associated with}} a good prognosis; therefore, the diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis should be made before irreversible damage has occurred. Nevertheless, the diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis still remains "an imperfect science, a hesitant art " [1]. <b>Epidemiology</b> <b>Cardiac</b> sarcoidosis was first described by Bernstein et al. [2] in an autopsy case. A period of 4 yrs later, Schaumann [3] demonstrated cardiac involvement in two further autopsy cases. In 1937, Gentzen [4] reported about giant cell granulomas in two patients with endomyocardial fibrosis, which was the first publication of death due to cardiac sarcoidosis. Until 1980, literature reports were limited to mainly anecdotal descriptions of single or small numbers of patients. Clinically apparent cardiac involvement has since been noted in 2 – 10 % of patients with proven sarcoidosis [1, 5 – 18]. Prior to th...|$|R
40|$|Myotonic {{dystrophy}} (dystrophia myotonica, DM) is {{the most}} frequently inheritedneuromuscular disease of adult life. DM is a multisystem disease with major cardiacinvolvement. Core features of myotonic dystrophy are myotonia, muscle weakness, cataract, and cardiac conduction abnormalities. Classical DM (first described by Steinert and called Steinert’s disease or DM 1) {{has been identified as}} an autosomal dominant disorder associated with the presence of an abnormal expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat on chromosome 19 q 13. 3 (the DM 1 locus). A similar but less common disorder was later described as proximal myotonic myop-athy, caused by alterations on a different gene on chromosome 3 q 21 (the DM 2 locus). This article will mainly focus on DM 1. It will provide an insight into the epidemiology and genetic alterations of the disease and provide up-to-date information on postmortem and clinical findings and on diagnostic and therapeutic options in patients presenting <b>cardiac</b> involvement. c <b>EPIDEMIOLOGY</b> AND CLASSIFICATION OF DM 1 The incidence of DM 1 is estimated to be 1 in 8000 births and its worldwide prevalence ranges from 2. 1 to 14. 3 / 100 000 inhabitants. 1 Based on the age of onset and on its clinical features, DM 1 can be divided into three forms: congenital, classical, and minimal, which may occur in the same kindred.

However, the relationship between resting heart rate and NT-proBNP is unclear. Objective: This study focuses on this relativity between resting heart rate and plasma NT-proBNP levels in a surveyed community-based population. Methods: We evaluated the relativity between resting heart rate and plasma levels of NT-proBNP in 1, 567 participants (mean age 61. 0 years, range 21 – 96 years) from a community-based population in Beijing, People’s Republic of China. Results: In patients with high resting heart rate (≥ 75 beats/min), NT-proBNP was higher than in those having low resting heart rate (< 75 beats/min). In multiple linear stepwise regression analysis, plasma NT-proBNP was associated with resting heart rate (partial correlation coefficient, 0. 82; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 18 – 1. 51; P= 0. 011). A subsequent subgroup analysis revealed that the association between resting heart rate and plasma NT-proBNP was strengthened in subjects over 60 years old (partial correlation coefficient 1. 28; 95 % confidence interval,  0. 49 – 2. 36; P= 0. 031); while the relativity between resting heart rate and plasma NT-proBNP was not emerged in the younger subgroup (< 60 years old). Conclusions: Resting heart rate was associated with plasma NT-proBNP in the elderly, which indicated a relationship between resting heart rate and cardiac function damage.

40|$|Bac k g r o u n d: Heart rate {{variability}} (HRV), {{a marker}} of cardiac autonomic function, {{has been associated with}} particulate matter (PM) air pollution, especially in older patients and those with cardiovascular diseases. However, the effect of PM exposure on cardiac autonomic function in young, healthy adults has received less attention. Objectives: We evaluated the relationship between exposure to traffic-related PM with an aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2. 5 µm (PM 2. 5) and HRV in a highly exposed panel of taxi drivers. Met h o d s: Continuous measurements of personal exposure to PM 2. 5 and ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring were conducted on 11 young healthy taxi drivers for a 12 -hr work shift during their work time (0900 – 2100 hr) before, during, and after the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games. Mixedeffects regression models were used to estimate associations between PM 2. 5 exposure and percent changes in 5 -min HRV indices after combining data from the three time periods and controlling for potentially confounding variables. Res u l t s: Personal exposures of taxi drivers to PM 2. 5 changed markedly across the three time periods. The standard deviation of normal-to-normal (SDNN) intervals decreased by 2. 2 % [95 % confidence interval (CI), – 3. 8 % to – 0. 6 %] with an interquartile range (IQR; 69. 5 µg/m 3) increase in the 30 -min PM 2. 5 moving average, whereas the low-frequency and high-frequency powers decreased by 4. 2 % (95 % CI, – 9. 0 % to 0. 8 %) and 6. 2 % (95 % CI, – 10. 7 % to – 1. 5 %), respectively, in association with an IQR increase in the 2 -hr PM 2. 5 moving average.

40|$|Background: Out-of-hospital {{cardiac arrest}} (OHCA) {{is a common}} cause of cardiac {{emergency}} and death. Worldwide, there is wide variation in epidemiology and survival of OHCA. Racial and ethnic disparities are important contributors towards such variation. OHCA is mostly cardiac in origin, however {{there are several other}} non-cardiac etiologies of OHCA including trauma, submersion, drugs intoxication, asphyxia, conflagration, electrocution. With increasing trauma burden, traumatic cardiac arrest (TCA) is becoming more common. There are limited population-based studies on OHCA in the Asian region. Aim: The aims were to establish a national OHCA registry and determine the epidemiology, prehospital interventions, emergency management and outcomes of OHCA of cardiac and noncardiac origin, with focus on TCA. Since Qatar, has a high trauma burden, TCA studies are feasible, important for public health and serve as important benchmarking indicators for EMS, cardiac and trauma services. Methods: Utstein based guidelines were followed for data collection on prospectively enrolled OHCA patients resuscitated by EMS for establishment of OHCA registry, in Qatar, from June 2012 to May 2015. Study I and II, utilized data from the OHCA registry, while Study III and IV also utilized data from the Trauma registry, in Qatar. Study I was a nationwide population-based study that analyzed OHCA registry patients to describe <b>epidemiology,</b> <b>cardiac</b> arrest features, emergency management, health services delivery and outcomes. Study II was a retrospective cohort study that compared epidemiology, clinical presentation, emergency management, health services delivery and outcomes between Middle Eastern Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Arab ethnic and North African ethnic OHCA patients. Study III was a nationwide population-based observational study that analyzed out-of-hospital traumatic cardiac arrest (OHTCA) patients utilizing the OHCA registry and Trauma registry. Study IV was a retrospective cohort study that redefined TCA in two distinct categories and compared in-hospital traumatic cardiac arrest (IHTCA) patients with OHTCA patients. Results: In Study I, the age-sex incidence of cardiac origin OHCA resuscitated by EMS was 87. 8 per 100, 000 population. Of the 447 OHCA patients analyzed, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) rate was 20. 6 % and survival rate was 8. 1 %. In multivariable regression analysis, survival was associated with initial shockable rhythm (OR 13. 4, 95 % CI 5. 4 – 33. 3), male gender (OR 0. 27, 95 % CI 0. 1 – 0. 8) and advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) (OR 0. 15, 95 % CI 0. 04 – 0. 5). In Study II, there were 285 Middle Eastern GCC Arab ethnicity OHCA patients compared with 112 North African ethnicity OHCA patients, in Qatar. Multivariable regression analysis model showed that North African OHCA patients were associated with initial shockable rhythm (OR 2. 86, 95 % CI 1. 30 - 6. 33), greater scene time (OR 1. 02 95 % CI 1. 0 - 1. 04) and diabetes (OR 0. 48, 95 % CI 0. 25 - 0. 91). In Study III, the mean annual crude incidence rate of OHTCA patients was 4. 0 per 100, 000 population, in Qatar. Of 410 OHTCA patients, majority had blunt injuries (94. 3 %) with survival rate of 2. 4 %. Multivariable regression analysis for return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) showed association with initial shockable rhythm (OR 6. 4, 95 % CI 1. 3 - 30. 7), external hemorrhage control (OR 5. 9, 95 % CI 1. 9 - 18. 0), and prehospital needle thoracostomy (OR 5. 3, 95 % CI 1. 3 - 21. 7). Univariate analysis for survival to hospital discharge showed association with initial shockable rhythm (OR 10. 12, CI 0. 97 – 105. 23), Adrenaline (OR 0. 045, CI 0. 006 – 0. 358), external hemorrhage control (OR 4. 2, CI 1. 03 – 16. 8), blood transfusion (OR 9. 22, CI 2. 5 – 33. 7) and surgery (OR 32. 1, CI 7. 54 136. 6) In Study IV, there were 410 OHTCA patients compared with 199 IHTCA patients, in Qatar. The mean annual crude incidence of IHTCA was 2. 0 per 100, 000 population with a survival rate of 7. 5 %. In multivariable regression analysis, IHTCA was associated with cardiac re-arrest (OR 6. 0, 95 % CI 3. 3 - 10. 8, p < 0. 00), abdominal injury (OR 2. 0, 95 % CI 1. 0 - 3. 8), spinal injury (OR 3. 5, 95 % CI 1. 5 - 8. 3), higher prehospital GCS (OR 1. 4, 95 % CI 1. 4 - 1. 6) and survival (OR 6. 3, 95 % CI 1. 3 - 31. 2). Conclusions: Standardized OHCA incidence and survival rates were comparable to industrialized countries but bystander CPR and defibrillation rates can be improved with tailored public education and training programs. North African OHCA patients were younger, associated with less risk factors, greater shockable rhythm, and received greater ACLS interventions with higher median EMS scene time compared to GCC Arab OHCA patients. Incidence of OHTCA was comparatively less than international rates and disproportionately low, relative to the trauma burden, in Qatar. Prehospital and emergency department (ED) management; hemorrhage control, needle thoracostomy, blood transfusion and surgery, were beneficial for survival and intervention studies are required to further guide management. IHTCA was a new sub-category of traumatic cardiac arrest that was defined and was associated with greater cardiac re-arrest, mean GCS score, initial shockable rhythm, and survival rates compared to OHTCA...|$|R
