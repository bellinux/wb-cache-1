30|$|<b>Contrast</b> of {{an image}} is quantitatively hard to measure. Moreover, there are several more {{definitions}} proposed for <b>contrast</b> measurement as stated in (Rizzi et al. 2004). However, there is no reference to compare an image from another in terms of <b>contrast.</b> <b>Contrast</b> value is just a scale. Low value of <b>contrast</b> causes the image <b>contrast</b> to under-saturate whereas high value of <b>contrast</b> causes the image <b>contrast</b> to over-saturate. The optimal <b>contrast</b> should lie between low and high <b>contrast</b> values. However, there is no comparative <b>contrast</b> value to show that one image {{is better than the}} other image in terms of <b>contrast.</b> Therefore, in the proposed method, the evaluation of image <b>contrast</b> is done through the evaluation of human visual system (HVS).

A letter <b>contrast</b> threshold function describes the lowest <b>contrast</b> letters that a client can recognize, over a range of sizes. <b>Contrast</b> sensitivity is the reciprocal of <b>contrast</b> threshold; higher sensitivity is better.

40|$|The human {{visual system}} changes with aging {{and one of}} the most {{important}} changes is the decrease of spatial <b>contrast</b> sensitivity. We investigated this change both for luminance <b>contrast</b> and chromaticity <b>contrast,</b> and both for threshold <b>contrast</b> and preferred <b>contrast,</b> (preferred by users to carry out a visual recognition task), in a series of psycho-physical experiments with achromatic and chromatic sinusoid gratings of different values of spatial frequency, hue, and luminance level, and with two observer groups: young and elderly observers. We investigated the spatial frequency range of 0. 1 - 10 cycles per degrees. Our results indicate that, beyond the expected luminance <b>contrast</b> sensitivity decline of the elderly observers, the difference between the preferred luminance <b>contrast</b> of the elderly and the preferred luminance <b>contrast</b> of the young is even more significant than the threshold difference. The small preference differences between the age groups for chromaticity <b>contrast</b> compared to luminance <b>contrast</b> suggests that while with increasing age both the chromatic and the achromatic <b>contrast</b> sensitivity drops, preferred <b>contrast</b> stays more stable for chromaticity <b>contrast</b> than for luminance <b>contrast.</b> close...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1987 A well-defined, {{quantitative}} {{model for}} determining soil <b>contrast</b> {{was developed to}} improve soil survey interpretations concerning the effects of mixtures {{of different kinds of}} soils on agricultural land use. The model was evaluated by determining the levels and reasons for soil <b>contrast</b> on mapped soil areas representing 5 different landscapes, each dominated by a different soil order. Several preliminary models are discussed. The final model is based on twelve soil properties including slope, drainage, depth of rooting, texture and pH. For each property, the range of possible values was divided into a small number of classes. By comparing classes, five levels of <b>contrast</b> (Very Similar, Similar, Somewhat <b>Contrasting,</b> <b>Contrasting,</b> Very <b>Contrasting)</b> were established within each property. These same five terms, plus an additional Exceedingly <b>Contrasting</b> class, were used to characterize the overall degree of <b>contrast</b> between any two soils. Overall <b>contrast</b> was determined by first comparing the property values of a pair of soils and determining the degree of <b>contrast</b> for each property. Then the overall <b>contrast</b> was set equal to either the <b>contrast</b> level for the most <b>contrasting</b> property or properties, or to the next higher <b>contrast</b> level if several properties varied between the two soils. Distributions of <b>contrast</b> levels within soil landscapes show that areas of Inceptisols, Ultisols, Alfisols and Mollisols are characterized by a high percentage of similar soils. The Aridisol landscape sampled had the highest percentage of exceedingly <b>contrasting</b> soils. The Alfisols and Mollisols sampled have the highest percentage of somewhat <b>contrasting</b> and very <b>contrasting</b> soils, respectively. Reasons for soil <b>contrast</b> were determined both by identifying those few properties that actually dictated the <b>contrast</b> level and by calculating a weighted average contribution of each of the 12 soil properties. In general, lower levels of <b>contrast</b> were controlled by one or two properties. At higher levels of <b>contrast,</b> more properties varied, and no property had as dominant an effect. Slope was the major factor controlling the <b>contrast</b> of similar soils. Drainage, pH, texture, and depth of rooting differences, all of which reflected differences in parent materials, were most often expressed at somewhat <b>contrasting</b> or <b>contrasting</b> levels. The most common reason for very <b>contrasting</b> soils was flooding, and that occurred where an alluvial soil was adjacent to an upland soil...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-Text can be {{depicted}} by luminance <b>contrast</b> (i. e., differences in luminance between characters and background) or by color <b>contrast</b> (i. e., differences in chromaticity). We used a psychophysical method {{to measure the}} reading speeds of eight normal and ten low-vision subjects for text displayed on a color monitor. Reading speed was measured {{as a function of}} luminance <b>contrast,</b> color <b>contrast</b> (derived from mixtures of red and green), and combinations of the two. When color <b>contrast</b> is high, normal subjects can read as rapidly as with high luminance <b>contrast</b> (> 300 words/min). Curves of reading speed versus <b>contrast</b> have the same shape for the two forms of <b>contrast</b> and are superimposed when <b>contrast</b> is measured in multiples of a threshold value. When both color and luminance <b>contrast</b> are present, {{there is no sign of}} additive interaction, and performance is determined by the form of <b>contrast</b> yielding the highest reading rate. Our findings suggest that color <b>contrast</b> and luminance <b>contrast</b> are coded in similar ways in the visual system but that the neural signals used in letter recognition are carried by different pathways for color and luminance. We found no advantages of color <b>contrast</b> for low-vision reading. For text composed of 6 ° characters, all low-vision subjects read better with luminance <b>contrast</b> than with color <b>contrast...</b>|$|R

The suprathreshold apparent <b>contrast</b> and threshold <b>contrast</b> sensitivity was repeatedly assessed during the recovery phase. Generally, an attenuation of suprathreshold apparent <b>contrast</b> was found for high and intermediate spatial frequencies in the eye with optic neuritis. At a low spatial frequency, however, the suprathreshold <b>contrast</b> vision was spared. The threshold <b>contrast</b> sensitivity was not however, spared at low spatial frequencies.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the spatial-frequency bandwidth of perceived suprathreshold <b>contrast.</b> It has been shown that for grating stimuli <b>contrast</b> detection thresholds depend on spatial frequency, grating area and the number of orientation components. However, suprathreshold <b>contrast</b> perception exhibits <b>contrast</b> constancy, i. e. suprathreshold <b>contrast</b> matches are independent of these stimulus parameters. To study whether <b>contrast</b> constancy applies to spatial-frequency bandwidth, <b>contrast</b> matching was performed and detection thresholds were measured for spatial noise stimuli at various bandwidths centred at 2 c/deg. At high <b>contrast</b> levels, <b>contrast</b> matches were nearly independent of stimulus spatial-frequency bandwidth up to about 6 octaves, even though detection thresholds increased with bandwidth. Thus, a broad band of spatial frequencies contributed to perceived suprathreshold <b>contrast.</b> The requisites for this are <b>contrast</b> constancy with respect to spatial frequency, and integration of <b>contrast</b> information across different spatial frequencies so that the effective bandwidth of the system is broad...|$|R

The results also suggested that simple statistics based metrics might produce a higher Pearson correlation value with both projector <b>contrast</b> and projector brightness than more complex <b>contrast</b> metrics. Our results demonstrated that the rank order of un-calibrated camera based measured <b>contrast</b> and radiometer based measured <b>contrast</b> is preserved for large steps of projector setting differences...|$|R
