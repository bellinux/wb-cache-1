5|$|Stratton wrote Social Psychology for International Conduct {{for social}} science {{teachers}} {{who wanted to}} use psychology to analyze international affairs. The book's first part evaluated races. Stratton concluded the <b>Caucasoid</b> and Mongoloid races were innately more intelligent enabling them to build strong cultures. He also stated the prejudice of other people was from {{the social and political}} advantages it brought. Stratton saw nations as made up of individuals and possessing a national character similar to what individuals had. Reviewing the book in the American Journal of Sociology, Ellsworth Faris objected to the author concluding the Northern and Central Europeans were more intelligent than Southern and Eastern Europeans, noting intelligence measures correlated also with length of stay in America.|$|E
25|$|The Turkic people {{display a}} great variety of ethnic types. They possess {{physical}} features ranging from <b>Caucasoid</b> to Northern Mongoloid. Mongoloid and <b>Caucasoid</b> facial structure is common among many Turkic groups, such as Chuvash people, Tatars, Kazakhs, Uzbeks, and Bashkirs.|$|E
25|$|The Andronovo {{have been}} {{described}} by archaeologists as exhibiting pronounced <b>Caucasoid</b> features. A 2004 study also established that, during the Bronze/Iron Age period, {{the majority of the}} population of Kazakhstan (part of the Andronovo culture during Bronze Age) was of West Eurasian origin (with mtDNA haplogroups such as U, H, HV, T, I and W), and that prior to the thirteenth to seventh century BC, all Kazakh samples belonged to European lineages. Other studies confirm that during Bronze Age in areas to the north of present-day China, the boundary between <b>Caucasoid</b> and Mongoloid populations was on the eastern slopes of the Altai, in Western Mongolia. Some <b>Caucasoid</b> influence extended also into Northeast Mongolia, and the population of present-day Kazakhstan was <b>Caucasoid</b> during the Bronze/Iron Age period. Archaeological investigations likewise suggest that in the steppe region of Central Asia and the Altai Mountains, the first food production began towards the end of the 3rd millennium BC and that the peoples who first entered this region were <b>Caucasoid</b> of the Afanasevo culture who came from the Aral Sea area (Kelteminar culture).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An {{interleukin}} 4 polymorphism {{has been}} studied in Teleutians, Shorians, and <b>Caucasoids</b> living in the Kemerovo Region. The groups of Teleutians and <b>Caucasoids</b> are characterised with even or close-to-even distribution of the IL- 4 alleles. The most widespread genotype in populations of Teleutians and <b>Caucasoids</b> was the 2 R/ 3 R heterozygosity, and 3 R/ 3 R {{proved to be the}} mostly rare. These data are indicative for mixing processes among Teleutians in the Kemerovo Region and Siberian <b>Caucasoids.</b> The major IL- 4 genotype in Shorian population was 3 R/ 3 R, and the heterozygotic genotype 2 R/ 3 R took the second position. </p...|$|R
2500|$|A study took {{panoramic}} radiographs of {{two sites}} at {{the angle of}} the mandible of 79 dental students, consisting of 20 male <b>Caucasoids,</b> 20 female <b>Caucasoids,</b> 17 male Mongoloids and 22 female Mongoloids. The abstract for the study said that the Mongoloids in the study had about [...] "20% higher bone density at {{the angle of the}} mandible" [...] than the <b>Caucasoids</b> in the study with a p-value of 0.0094 for the males and a p-value of 0.0004 for females.|$|R
25|$|In 1962, Carleton S. Coon {{said that}} one of the reasons that Mongoloids have flatter faces than <b>Caucasoids</b> is due to the {{masseter}} and temporalis jaw muscles in the faces of Mongoloids being positioned more toward the front of the faces of Mongoloids relative to where these jaw muscles are positioned in the faces of <b>Caucasoids.</b>|$|R

25|$|In the 19th century Meyers Konversations-Lexikon (1885–90), <b>Caucasoid</b> {{was one of}} {{the three}} great races of humankind, {{alongside}} Mongoloid and Negroid. The taxon was taken to consist of a number of subtypes. The <b>Caucasoid</b> peoples were usually divided into three groups on ethnolinguistic grounds, termed Aryan (Indo-European), Semitic (Semitic languages), and Hamitic (Hamitic languages i.e. Berber-Cushitic-Egyptian).|$|E

25|$|According to George W. Gill {{and other}} modern {{forensic}} anthropologists, physical traits of <b>Caucasoid</b> crania {{can be distinguished}} {{from those of the}} people from Mongoloid and Negroid racial groups based on the shapes of specific diagnostic anatomical features. They assert that they can identify a <b>Caucasoid</b> skull with an accuracy of up to 95%. However, Alan H. Goodman cautions that this precision estimate is often based on methodologies using subsets of samples. He also argues that scientists have a professional and ethical duty to avoid such biological analyses since they could potentially have sociopolitical effects.|$|E
25|$|Carleton Coon (1962) {{argued that}} <b>Caucasoid</b> traits emerged {{prior to the}} Cro-Magnons, and {{were present in the}} Skhul and Qafzeh hominids. However, these fossils and the Predmost {{specimen}} were held to be Neanderthaloid derivatives, because they possessed short cervical vertabrae, lower and narrower pelves, and had some Neanderthal skull traits. Coon further asserted that the <b>Caucasoid</b> race was of dual origin, consisting of early dolichocephalic(e.g. Galley Hill, Combe-Capelle, Téviec) and Neolithic Mediterranean Homo sapiens (e.g. Muge, Long Barrow, Corded), as well as Neanderthal-influenced brachycephalic Homo sapiens dating to the Mesolithic and Neolithic (e.g. Afalou, Hvellinge, Fjelkinge).|$|E

50|$|Nordic theory, in Grant's formulation, {{was similar}} to many 19th century racial philosophies which divided the human species into {{primarily}} three distinct races: <b>Caucasoids</b> (based in Europe), Negroids (based in Africa), and Mongoloids (based in Asia). Nordic theory, however, further subdivided <b>Caucasoids</b> into three groups: Nordics (who inhabited Northern Europe {{and other parts of}} the continent), Alpines (whose territory included central Europe and parts of Asia), and Mediterraneans (who inhabited Southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{subpopulation}} {{structure of}} immunocompetent cells of peripheral blood, concentration of IgA, IgM, IgG, IgE and serum levels of IL- 4 and IL- 10 for the patients was studied. Reduced contents of CD 8 +, CD 56 + lymphocytes and increased contents of CD 4 +, CD 22 + lymphocytes, serum levels of IgA, IgM, IgG, IgE are revealed in Hkakass with asthma compared to healthy Hkakass. It was also revealed in Hkakass with asthma that contents of CD 3 + and CD 8 + lymphocytes, serum concentration of IgA, IgE increased compared to <b>Caucasoids</b> with asthma. The serum level of cytokines IL- 4 {{were found to}} be considerably increased in Hkakass with asthma compared to healthy Hkakass and to <b>Caucasoids</b> with asthma.

25|$|Hispanics with mostly <b>Caucasoid</b> or Negroid {{features}} may not {{be recognized}} as such in the United States {{in spite of the}} ethnic and racial diversity of most Hispanic American populations. Hispanics who do not look like the stereotypical Hispanic may have their ancestral status questioned or even challenged by others. Actors Martin Sheen, Alexis Bledel and Cameron Diaz, for example, are Hispanic even though they may be presumed not to be so because, being white, they do not fit the stereotype. If Hispanics with mostly <b>Caucasoid</b> features are to be considered Hispanic, they have stereotypical Mediterranean/Southern European appearance - olive skin, dark hair, and dark eyes.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, Carleton Coon argued that the <b>Caucasoid</b> race is of dual origin {{consisting}} of Upper Paleolithic (mixture of H. sapiens and H. neanderthalensis) types and Mediterranean (purely H. sapiens) types.

25|$|The Europeans {{believed}} that some Tutsis had facial characteristics that were generally atypical of other Bantus.
