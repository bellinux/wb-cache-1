40|$|Biopolitics, <b>Civil</b> <b>Society</b> and Political Eschatology: Foucault’s {{distrust}} in the population’s inherent forces Michel Foucault’s scepticism toward discourses on {{the organic}} vitality of populations {{is not only}} explainable by {{his attention to the}} dark ‘underside of biopolitics – the risks of persecution of individuals, who threaten the population’s vitality from the inside. Moreover, it should be understood in light of Foucault’s acute sensitivity to the deep-seated, conflict-ridden nature of the population in terms of its inherent potential for cultural clashes, violent struggles, suspicions, hatred, or, in short, the perpetual conflicts of <b>civil</b> <b>society.</b> Foucault’s work led him to a position of ambiguous support for the state and to a more evident distrust in the forces of the population. He used the term “political eschatologies” about antipolitical visions that pronounce the end of politics in a final accord where social contradictions dissolve and the community will prevail over the state. Foucault played on the religious significations of the term, especially in regard to the religious, fanatic rejection of the duality between state and <b>civil</b> <b>society,</b> a <b>rejection</b> that rests on the belief in a completion of historical and political time and the final salvation of all in “the city of God”. The article demonstrates Foucault’s highly ambiguous view of <b>civil</b> <b>society,</b> it examines his discussion Ferguson’s work on <b>civil</b> <b>society,</b> and it considers Foucault’s use of the term “political eschatologies” to indicate the dangers of extreme, anti-state, political movements. It challenges the image of Foucault as an unequivocal proponent of grass roots and identity politics.   Sociologisk Forsknings digitala arkiv</p...|$|R

40|$|What is {{happening}} to <b>civil</b> <b>society?</b> Until recently, we have equated itwith the nation-state. Or rather, the nation-state has defined <b>civil</b> <b>society.</b> We speak of Danish <b>civil</b> <b>society,</b> French <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> and so on. This makes good sense. <b>Civil</b> <b>society</b> is indeed anchored in an institutional and legal complex set-up and maintained by the state (Cohen and Arato, 1992). As a consequence, <b>civil</b> <b>societies</b> exist under {{a wide variety of}} conditions depending on regime type. Military dictatorships suppress <b>civil</b> <b>society,</b> while democracies promote it. In some cases, <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> is even seen as a force of change. In the 1980 s and 1990 s, there was much excitement among sociolo-gists about its role in bringing about changes towards democracy in Latin America and Eastern Europe. Again, this power was attributed to national <b>civil</b> <b>societies.</b> What took place in Polish <b>civil</b> <b>society,</b> and what did Brazil-ian <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> do? But something happened in the early 1990 s when the concept of globaliz-ation made its way into the social sciences to a fanfare. <b>Civil</b> <b>society</b> was easily appended to this discussion {{and all of a sudden}} everyone was speaking about global <b>civil</b> <b>society.</b> Globalization was apparently pulling up the national tent pegs of <b>civil</b> <b>society,</b> pushing it into a global sphere where indi-viduals and social movements interact across physical, social, political and cultural distances. Despite the slightly sarcastic tone I am using here, there is no doubt that something like this is occurring. And the concept of global <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> may even be convenient shorthand for describing it. But how well does the concept work analytically and theoretically?
