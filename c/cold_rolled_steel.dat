500|$|Colossus's {{movements}} were re-recorded with performer T.J. Storm, as Tricoteux {{had been unable}} to move athletically due to the platform shoes he had to wear on set to replicate the character's height. LaSalle was used for his facial performance. DD then mapped these performances onto a digital model that was designed to be comic-accurate. The team sought specific reference for Colossus's metallic finish to avoid looking [...] "chromey", visiting a metal company to look at various samples. They settled on <b>cold</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>steel,</b> with the darker hot rolled steel used for his hair. The model also includes ridges on the character, which could be moved separately {{from the rest of the}} model to keep them always perfectly straight as in the comic books. DD also created the model of Deadpool that was used by all vendors. His mask is animated around the eyes to be expressive as in the comics, which helped balance out the [...] "chinwag" [...] caused by Reynolds' acting coming through the bottom of the mask. Replacing Deadpool's head fully was going to be too costly, so Weta Digital instead warped each shot based on facial reference from Reynolds, and adjusted the lighting to reflect the changes. This was called an [...] "ingenious 2D-ish solution".|$|E

40|$|Cold-formed steel {{products}} find extensive application in modern construction in both low-rise and high-rise steel buildings. In low-rise construction, primary {{as well as}} secondary framing members are fabricated using cold-formed steel sections, while in high-rise buildings; roof and floor decks, steel joists, wall panels, door/window frames, and sandwich panel partitions are successfully built using cold-formed <b>steel</b> sections. In <b>cold</b> <b>roll</b> <b>steel</b> construction, fibre cement board is used as cladding material over steel sections on inside and outside, which creates a cavity wall action. Later on, glass wool and mineral wool insulation are also inserted in these walls making buildings more energy efficient in summer {{as well as in}} winter. In this paper, a comparison has been carried out between ordinary/conventional construction of a two roomed simple building and <b>cold</b> <b>roll</b> <b>steel</b> construction for the same type of building. The comparison includes design, analysis, structural detailing, cost and management on site for execution of both types of systems. It was found that <b>cold</b> <b>roll</b> <b>steel</b> construction has highest strength-to-weight ratio, easy to handle, quick and precise in manufacturing, fast in construction and dimensionally stable - does not expand or contract with moisture content. Also there is less probability of foundation problems due to less weight and less probability of damage due to earthquakes and heavy winds. Lighter structure with stronger connections results in less seismic forces. As <b>cold</b> <b>roll</b> <b>steel</b> construction is new in Pakistan and most of the material is being imported, so its prices are on higher side but still approximately 40 %- 50 % less than conventional construction beside it’s all other benefits and energy efficiency behaviour...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the adhesiveness of uncoated and zinc-electrogalvanized steel sheets used in the automotive industry. Three types of adhesives, one acrylic and two epoxy resins, were employed to join low carbon <b>cold</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>steels,</b> one uncoated and another electrogalvanized, both previously degreased or chemically pickled. Mechanical strength of the joints was evaluated by the T-peel and tensile strength tests. Steel grade, surface condition and heating below the cure temperatures did not influence the joints' mechanical strength. However, their shear strength decreased drastically as the test temperature increased. The exposure of the joints to an atmosphere with 90 % relative humidity at 40 °C caused reduction of their shear strength. Epoxy adhesives showed higher mechanical strength, but exhibited higher degradation by humidity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Stored {{energy in}} {{deformed}} metals {{plays an important}} role during the annealing process by providing the initial driving force for recovery and recrystallization. Many direct or indirect measurement and calculation methods have been used to evaluate the amount and distribution of the stored energy in the past decades. The advent of relatively new analytical techniques such as Electron Back-Scattered Diffraction (EBSD) has permitted the development of mathematical models such as Sub-grain Method, Image Quality (IQ) Method and Taylor Factor Method etc., these new techniques have permitted a much better understanding of the annealing behavior of <b>cold</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>steels.</b> The sub-grain method based on the level of sub-grain structure is used in our study to quantify the stored energy distribution prior to and its evolution during the batch annealing process of <b>cold</b> <b>rolled</b> HSLA <b>steels.</b> Orientation dependent stored energy distribution maps at different annealing stages have been constructed and analyzed. The results of this study show that the stored energy increases with cold rolling reduction ratio and its distribution through the thickness of the steel sample is not uniform due to the inherit inhomogeneous deformation process. The stored energy was continuously consumed during annealing. The amount of γ-fiber was relatively lower than the α-fiber in the specific steel sample, which can have a strong effect on the available drivin...|$|R
