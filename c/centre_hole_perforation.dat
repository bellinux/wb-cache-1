40|$|AbstractTo {{investigate}} the radiation characteristics of reflector antennas with surface deformation and perforation, the physical optics (PO) method and physical theory of diffraction (PTD) technique {{are used to}} calculate the far field and the diffraction of the reflector edge. The computational method is verified reliably by comparing the calculation curve with the experimental curve. As a consequence, the radiation patterns for different deformation properties and different perforation densities are computed.

A graphic is printed on the front side of the film which contains circular <b>holes</b> (<b>perforations)</b> covering up to {{fifty percent of the}} surface area. The eye focuses on light reflecting from the printed colors of the graphic rather than light passing through the perforations. The other side of the film is usually black to create a one-way effect (the graphic on the front side is not visible). From this side the view through the film is dominant because the black layer absorbs more light than is reflected.|$|R

40|$|Austenitic {{stainless}} steel cylinders and rings are spray water quenched to create residual stresses at {{or greater than}} the yield strength. The residual stresses are measured using neutron diffraction, and two mechanical strain relaxation methods: deep hole drilling and incremental <b>centre</b> <b>hole</b> drilling. This paper compares the measurements with predictions of quenching using finite element analysis. Also finite element analysis is used to mimic deep <b>hole</b> and incremental <b>centre</b> <b>hole</b> drilling methods and to reconstruct residual stresses {{as if they have}} been measured. The measurements reveal similar trends to the predictions but there is only limited agreement between their magnitudes. However, there is better agreement between the reconstructed stresses and the measurements. Both the two mechanical strain relaxation methods reveal that large discrepancies occur between measurements and predictions arise because of plasticity. Irrespective of this and surprisingly there is good agreement between deep hole drilling and neutron diffraction measurements...|$|R

30|$|When {{perforating}} with an abrasive water jet, it {{is possible}} that the pressure in the <b>hole</b> (<b>perforation)</b> will be higher than that in the annulus because of water jet blasting against the hole wall, which also is the theoretical basis for the technology of hydro-jet fracturing. This paper analyzes the mechanism of generating pressure stagnation in water jet hole, and puts forward a new concept of hydroseal. Then, the distribution of pressure in the hole was simulated with the finite element method. The simulation results showed that the pressure in the hole was higher than that in the annulus. Also, the lower the annular pressure (confining pressure) and the higher the blasting pressure, the greater the pressure difference. An experiment indicated that the cement sample was lifted up under the pressure stagnation in the hole, which proved the finite element simulation results obviously.|$|R

This thesis investigates {{the use of}} partial-length steel cover plates about column mid-height to improve the weak-axis buckling resistance. The present research first reviews literature concerning the Euler buckling of members with partial-length reinforcement. Inelastic buckling is simulated by 3 -D finite element analysis accounting for cover plate length, cover plate area, bolt <b>hole</b> <b>perforations,</b> yield stresses, residual and locked-in dead load stresses, and initial out-of-straightness. The model is validated by a load test of a full-scale column with bolted reinforcement plates.

An equation developed through multiple linear regression is proposed for a simplified procedure for preliminary design...|$|R

Under a bias voltage of 4. 0 V, MOS cells with perforated ITO and plain ITO, respectively, presented conversion efficiencies of 17. 53 % and 15. 80 %.

50|$|The {{pressure}} of fluid in an infected middle ear onto the eardrum may {{cause it to}} rupture. Usually this consists of a small <b>hole</b> (<b>perforation),</b> which allows fluid to drain out. If this does not occur naturally, a myringotomy (tympanotomy, tympanostomy) can be performed. A myringotomy is a surgical procedure in which a tiny incision is created in the eardrum to relieve pressure caused by excessive buildup of fluid, or to drain pus from the middle ear. The fluid or pus comes from a middle ear infection (otitis media), which is a common problem in children. A tympanostomy tube is inserted into the eardrum to keep the middle ear aerated for a prolonged time and to prevent reaccumulation of fluid. Without the insertion of a tube, the incision usually heals spontaneously {{in two to three}} weeks. Depending on the type, the tube is either naturally extruded in 6 to 12 months or removed during a minor procedure.|$|R

40|$|The thermo-acoustic {{behaviour}} {{of multiple}} premixed laminar flames is analysed. The idea {{is used to}} (de) compose the flame Transfer Function (TF) of composite multiple flame configurations to/from the TF of constituent sub-systems of the flame. The TF superposition approach {{is based on the}} additive nature of the flame heat release rate. It is shown that the cumulative (total) flame TF can be represented as a weighted sum of elemental TF’s of the flame sub-systems where the weighting factors are related to the thermal power of the particular flames. On the basis of this approach, the thermo-acoustic TF’s of the burner decks with regular round <b>hole</b> <b>perforation</b> are experimentally studied. It is found that, the <b>perforation</b> <b>hole</b> diameter and the perforation pattern porosity are the governing parameters of the constituent TF’s. For burner decks with square patterns of unisize round holes the TF was studied {{as a function of the}} hole diameter, inter-hole spacing and mean flow rate. The TF composed via the superposition of TF’s measured for unisize perforations gives a good indication of the TF of the composite (multi-size) pattern if the elemental (unisize) TF’s are measured for the burner deck with the same porosity as the composite one. Possible simplifications and extensions of the proposed TF (de) composition principle are discussed. The practical perspective of this research is to offer an opportunity for the design of burner deck patterns with desirable acoustic characteristics...|$|R
50|$|An unfortunate mishap is the {{resemblance}} between Latin thyroidea and English thyroid {{on the one}} side and Ancient Greek θυροειδής on the other side, as the latter does not mean shield-like, but actually means like a door, derived from θύρα, door. Θυροειδής is however used in anatomic nomenclature in the expression θυροειδές τρῆμα (τρῆμα = <b>hole,</b> <b>perforation,</b> aperture), coined by the Greek physician Galen. Ancient Greek θύρα can be translated, besides the earlier mentioned door, as gate, entrance and opening. The Greek name θυροειδές τρῆμα for this opening between the os pubis and the os ischii, currently called obturator foramen, clearly originates for being an opening (θύρα), while bearing no resemblance to a shield (θυρεός). The Latin translation foramen thyreoideum for θυροειδές τρῆμα of the 18th-19th-century German physician and anatomist Samuel Thomas von Sömmerring is clearly mistaken. The current foramen thyroideum of the Terminologia Anatomica is not a Latin translation of Galen's θυροειδές τρῆμα, but an orthographic revision of what was previously known in the Nomina Anatomica as foramen thyreoideum, an inconstantly present opening in the lamina of the thyroid cartilage.|$|R
50|$|Deep hole {{drilling}} (DHD) is a residual stress measurement technique {{used to measure}} locked-in and applied stresses in engineering materials and components. DHD is a semi-destructive mechanical strain relaxation (MSR) technique, which seeks to measure the distribution of stresses along the axis of a drilled reference hole. The process is unique {{in its ability to}} measure residual stresses at a microscopic level with a penetration of over 750 mm, without total destruction of the original component. DHD is considered deep in comparison to other {{hole drilling}} techniques such as <b>centre</b> <b>hole</b> drilling.|$|R
