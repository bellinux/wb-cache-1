[...] I've lost {{perspective}} on that now, because to me, the honest truth is I geek out on little stuff now as much as anybody.

500|$|Voorhis's {{supposed}} {{involvement with}} and endorsement by the CIO's P.A.C., which {{was believed to}} be a Communist front organization, was a major issue in the campaign. Nixon's campaign manager claimed to have proof of Voorhis's involvement with the group. On September 13, the two candidates met at a debate at South Pasadena Junior High School. When Nixon was challenged to produce proof of the allegation, Nixon took from his pocket a local bulletin of the National Citizens Political Action Committee that contained an endorsement of Voorhis. This was a different group, also affiliated with the CIO. While Voorhis's staff was aware of this endorsement, no one had told the representative. Voorhis, confronted with the bulletin, noted that these were two different groups. Nixon responded by reading the names of the boards of directors of the two groups, with many names in common. After the debate, Voorhis asked Congressman Chester E. Holifield for his view of how it had gone, and Holifield responded, [...] "Jerry, he <b>cut</b> <b>you</b> to pieces." [...] Voorhis had been successfully linked with [...] "the PAC", though he had refused to accept the endorsement of any PAC unless it renounced Communist influence. Nixon defeated Voorhis by over 15,000 votes and Time magazine praised the future president for [...] "politely avoid personal attacks on his opponent".|$|E

Select's Ian Harrison liked the song, but felt that it [...] "pilfers from The Smiths 'How Soon Is Now?'". In a review for Billboard, Larry Flick rated [...] "Vow" [...] his Critic's Choice and wrote, [...] "Move over Courtney Love. Garbage combine the tough-headed hooks of Hole with an unforgettable vocal prowl which rivals 'Miss World'.

2500|$|The album drew a mixed {{critical}} reaction, {{with many}} reviewers commenting favorably on it but criticizing its traditional rock sound. The staff of Ultimate Guitar enjoyed the album, rating it 7 stars out of 10, but declared that it [...] "seems to be {{frozen in the}} '70s", criticizing Heppner's singing and the overt influences from bands such as AC/DC, Black Sabbath and Motörhead (even though Heppner has stated {{he is not a}} Motörhead fan), but otherwise praising the group for the song [...] "Time Will <b>Cut</b> <b>You</b> Down" [...] and the cowbell on [...] "Run Home". Tom Breihan wrote for Pitchfork Media that Hello Master was largely derivative of some of the aforementioned acts plus Ted Nugent, but noted that that was not necessarily a bad thing; Breihan mainly disliked [...] "Living Like a Dog" [...] but praised [...] "Talk to Her" [...] and [...] "Time Will <b>Cut</b> <b>You</b> Down", the latter in particular for its chorus, and gave the record 7.3 points out of 10. Prefix writer Zach Hothorn, giving the album a 6.0 out of 10, considered [...] "Time Will <b>Cut</b> <b>You</b> Down" [...] as [...] "a nice reprieve from the incessant open-A Angus Young riffing", and criticized [...] "Blood" [...] as [...] "sound like an afterthought" [...] and compared it to Queens of the Stone Age. Rating the album 3.0 out of 5 and suggesting that the band were having a crisis of musical identity on the record, as the album art seemed indicative of a different style of music than was present on the album, Sputnikmusic staff reviewer Irving Tan wrote that {{the second half of the}} album strove too diligently to mimic Metallica, Black Sabbath and Budgie, except for closing track [...] "Blood" [...] (which he said was the album's [...] "most intriguing" [...] song and evidence of the band's true potential). IGN's Chad Grishow gave a mixed review of 6.6 out of 10 and explained that [...] "Two Kids" [...] (mistakenly identifying Heppner as singing lead vocals on that song) and [...] "Blood" [...] (which he said sounded like a [...] "completely different band" [...] and would have been most fitting as a B-side) were the best tracks on the album, but that Priestess were inferior to like-minded [...] "retro sound" [...] contemporaries Wolfmother.|$|E
