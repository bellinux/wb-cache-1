5000|$|As a {{political}} animal, man {{has come to}} see himself as possessed of rights, whether these are the Rights of Englishmen of old, or the universal human rights advocated vigorously toward establishment today through the matrix of commercialism. At least in the today dominant American model, deprivation of right amounts to injury (consider especially Justice Stevens dissenting opinion in Castle Rock v. Gonzales), and injury—so goes the prevailing theory—amounts, when coupled with requisite intent, in most cases, to crime, when it does not admit of <b>civil</b> <b>redress.</b> Thus, again in simple terms, {{and to the extent}} that human beings are indeed political beings, crime does seem to have an ontological basis.

This, further, seems to hold if ontology itself is divided into political and trans- or supra- or meta- political ontology—i.e., what once was the realm of Christian theology. Of course, it does not matter whether that theology is Christian or belonging to some other apolitical belief. The point is that one may, with some justice, argue persuasively that being is divided.

40|$|The Open Society Justice Initiative has {{released}} a report assessing the availability of legal remedies for addressing corrupt practices in the natural resource industries. Legal Remedies for the Resource Curse is a digest of practical experience in using law to combat corruption across jurisdictions. When resource extraction companies can obtain oil, diamonds, gold, coltan, timber, and other natural resources through covert contacts with unaccountable government officials, the losers are {{the people in the}} communities where the wealth originates. The power of corrupt governments frequently derives from monopoly access to natural wealth, bolstered by foreign government and industry allies. Local populations suffer the effects of the "resource curse," including the destruction of their immediate environment and the social and economic devastation that follows: arbitrary eviction and dispossession, unlawful arrest or harassment, and neglect of health care, housing, and education. This report reviews some of the main legal instruments used to date to combat natural resource corruption—as well as new, untested legal remedies that appear promising. Focusing on resource spoliation in Africa, it provides case studies to demonstrate what has and has not worked. The report treats the "home countries" of resource extraction companies separately from the "host countries" where they operate. It looks at both criminal and <b>civil</b> means of <b>redress.</b> Although corruption in transnational resource extraction is generally subject to inadequate legal safeguards, the report identifies opportunities for civil society action...|$|R

The major premise of this work is that the existing orthodox methods of <b>redressing</b> <b>civil</b> claims, of small value, are totally insufficient and unsuitable for processing and adjudicating upon such claims. The function and effectiveness of public agencies, in pursuing individual claims, is examined. Both state and federal agencies' powers are considered.

The dichotomy of court and tribunal structures is of particular importance; the study examines all major aspects of the fora and relies upon empirical surveys conducted in the United States and Australia. Next the class- action device is examined in the Anglo-Australian context (drawing particular comparison with both the New York- and Canadian experiences).

40|$|At {{the time}} this Article was written, {{delegations}} from forty-five countries {{were in the process}} of drafting the Convention on Jurisdiction and Foreign Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters (2 ̆ 2 the Hague Convention 2 ̆ 2) under the auspices of the Hague Conference on Private International Law. [Since the writing of this Article, the drafters significantly scaled back the project, which now addresses only commercial disputes. Prior to this change of emphasis, drafters adopted draft text similar to that advocated in this Article. ] The Hague Convention sought to establish a foundation for a worldwide regime for the free enforcement of civil judgments in exchange for the rigid regulation of assertions of personal jurisdiction. Accordingly, the proposed Hague Convention would have obliged signatories to prohibit the exercise of certain bases of personal jurisdiction and would have required the enforcement of only those judgments obtained through the application of a mandatory basis of jurisdiction. Other bases of jurisdiction were to be allowed, but the enforcement of any resultant judgment would have been discretionary. The deliberations raised high stakes for parties engaged in litigation seeking to enforce international human rights, international humanitarian law, and international criminal law through civil actions in domestic courts. Civil actions initiated by victims or the families of victims of human rights violations likely fell under the draft Hague Convention 2 ̆ 7 s proposed definition of 2 ̆ 2 civil and commercial matters. 2 ̆ 2 This would include suits brought under the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), the Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA), the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA), and the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act (FSIA) in the United States. Similarly, the ability of victims of human rights abuses to bring claims for reparations in connection with criminal trials (i. e., parties civiles), as is allowed in many civil law jurisdictions, would also have been affected by the Hague Convention 2 ̆ 7 s proposed provisions. If such criminal cases involved an extraterritorial assertion of jurisdiction, companion civil suits may have been prohibited by the proposed Hague Convention 2 ̆ 7 s jurisdictional regime. This Article addresses the impact the proposed Hague Convention might have had on these lawsuits. The Article begins with a brief survey of the way in which such litigation proceeds in domestic courts in both civil and common law jurisdictions. It examines the exercise of jurisdiction in these suits with reference to exemplary cases. It then recounts the genesis of the proposed Hague Convention and the impact it could have had on civil human rights cases if the drafters had not included language exempting such litigation from the proposed jurisdictional regime. The Article demonstrates that if the Hague Convention were adopted without a special provision protecting human rights litigation, it could severely hamper one of the most innovative developments in international law and unduly interfere with present and future efforts by states to comply with duties under international treaty and customary law. The Article argues that the Hague Convention must not foreclose civil cases based on human rights violations, particularly given the importance to victims of <b>civil</b> <b>redress</b> in domestic courts and the paucity of legal institutions in which victims of human rights abuses can seek <b>civil</b> <b>redress</b> from responsible individuals. Finally, the Article suggests adjustments to the draft then under consideration and presents a proposal for interpretation that will disarm these threats, leave intact existing avenues for the <b>civil</b> <b>redress</b> of human rights violations, and enhance the enforcement of international norms in national courts...|$|E

40|$|The American <b>Civil</b> Rights Movement <b>redresses</b> one of {{the great}} injustices in American history: the racial {{inequality}} faced by African‐Americans. However, the dominant understanding of the challenge to racial injustice is an incomplete one. It largely caters to only the Civil Rights period in the public sphere. The public sphere focused upon men and public events and legislations, while the private sphere was both feminized and centered on the home. In terms of a wider understanding, many historians have failed to account for the home as providing insight into race relations and racial encounters during the Civil Rights era. This dissertation argues the importance of studying the laws of Jim Crow’s neglected “other half”: Jane Crow. It focuses upon the home and the relationship between African‐American domestics and white housewives in terms of the long‐standing unjust race‐relations in America. Racial discrimination was a dynamic embedded within Southern culture. However, it was concealed through the superficial and external ideology of the Jim Crow laws. These laws advocated the notion of separate but equal, but were ultimately a power mechanism. Jim Crow functioned to segregate African‐Americans and whites in a way that constantly reminded African‐Americans of their supposed inferiority. This research is conducted through both primary and secondary source material. The primary sources consist of mainly fiction including: novels, a film and an autobiography. These sources offer a window into the private sphere of the home. They showcase racism through exploring the racial interactions in an environment that required intimacy. The secondary material will provide supporting factual evidence for the themes and ideas found in the primary sources. These will consist of scholarly books, reviews and journal articles...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{offers a}} new {{approach}} for conceptualizing vote dilution claims. Professor Gerken argues that abridgment {{of the right to}} an undiluted vote is a special kind of injury, one that does not fit easily within a conventional individual rights framework. She demonstrates that vote dilution claims require a court to examine the relative treatment of groups in determining whether an individual has been harmed. Professor Gerken terms rights that share this special characteristic 2 ̆ 2 aggregate rights. 2 ̆ 2 After closely examining the unique attributes of aggregate rights, the Article uses the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Shaw v. Hunt - specifically its application of a traditional form of strict scrutiny to a remedy for vote dilution - to explore how the differences between conventional individual rights and aggregate rights play out in practice. Professor Gerken demonstrates that a doctrinal structure built around a traditional conception of individual rights fails to achieve its purpose when applied {{in the context of an}} aggregate harm. She further explains how a doctrine like strict scrutiny can be tailored to fit within an aggregate rights framework. Finally, Professor Gerken examines the difficult normative questions raised by an aggregate rights approach. She suggests that although an aggregate right does notfit easily with conventional assumptions about individual rights, it nonetheless can properly be deemed an individual right. She notes, however, that to the extent that the group-based characteristics of aggregate rights seem inconsistent with individualist principles, there is no easy doctrinal fix for this problem because these characteristics stem from the nature of the underlying injury. Thus, she concludes that the Court 2 ̆ 7 s adherence to a highly individualist notion of rights in Shaw v. Hunt portends a serious constitutional battle. At stake will be the constitutionality of Section 2 and other measures to <b>redress</b> <b>civil</b> rights injuries that share dilution 2 ̆ 7 s unique attributes, as well as some of the basic principles that undergird our representative democracy...|$|R
40|$|Whether an {{individual}} becomes {{a party to}} judicial proceeding involuntarily, as a criminal or civil defendant, or voluntarily, as a <b>civil</b> plaintiff seeking <b>redress</b> of an injury, the assistance of counsel will increase his chances for a favorable disposition. When an impecunious litigant is unable to retain counsel, the question arises of who must bear the burden created by the complexity of adjudication. Although the Supreme Court has been sympathetic {{to the need for}} counsel in criminal cases, an indigent litigant in civil cases often will be denied legal assistance, and therefore will bear the burden himself In other instances, the public will assume this burden by procuring and compensating attorneys or public defenders to represent litigants who cannot afford counsel. Finally, members of the legal profession themselves may be required to carry this burden by representing the poor without compensation upon court appointment. The alternative that places the cost of representing impecunious litigants upon individual attorneys, rather than upon the public or upon the litigants themselves, might at first glance seem the least equitable. Such a system runs contrary to general expectations that professionals be compensated for their services. However, American courts have long exercised the authority, at least in criminal cases, to compel attorneys to donate their services. Recent constitutional challenges to this practice generally have been rejected, based either upon the broad licensing authority of the states or upon the unique relationship of attorneys to the courts. This Note considers the constitutionality of requiring attorneys to provide uncompensated legal assistance. While the discussion centers upon court appointment of attorneys in civil cases, the analysis is also applicable to criminal cases. First, the Note outlines the demand for legal assistance to the poor and the types of constitutional challenges usually raised to compelled representation. The Note then examines the power of courts to compel attorneys to provide gratuitous legal services, analyzing the traditional justifications advanced by courts to shield compelled representation from constitutional scrutiny. Finding these justifications unpersuasive, the Note proceeds to examine the constitutional challenges to court appointment of attorneys, concluding that there is no constitutional bar to compelling attorneys to render uncompensated legal assistance to poor litigants in civil cases...|$|R
40|$|Corporate {{criminal}} liability is a controversial beast. To a large extent, the controversies surround three core questions: first, {{whether there is}} a basic conceptual justification for using a system of criminal justice constructed for individuals against inanimate entities like corporations; second, what value corporate {{criminal liability}} could have given co-existent possibilities of <b>civil</b> <b>redress</b> against them; and third, whether corporate criminal liability has any added value over and above individual criminal responsibility of corporate officers. In this paper, I use examples from the frontiers of international criminal justice to criticize all sides of these debates. In particular, I harness the latent possibility of prosecuting corporate actors for the pillage of natural resources and for complicity through the supply of weapons, to highlight the shortcomings of corporate criminal theory to date. Throughout, I draw on principles derived from philosophical and legal pragmatism to reveal a set of recurring analytical flaws in this literature. These include: a tendency to presuppose a perfect single jurisdiction that overlooks globalization, the blind projection of local theories of corporate criminal responsibility onto global corporate practices; and a perspective that sometimes seems insensitive to the plight of the many who have fallen victim to corporate crime in the developing world. To begin anew, we need to embrace a pragmatic theory of corporate criminal liability that is forced upon us in a world as complex, unequal, and dysfunctional as that we presently inhabit...|$|E
40|$|This Note, {{focusing}} on New York law, {{demonstrates that the}} statute of limitations is the primary procedural difficulty that adult victims of childhood incest abuse encounter in bringing their civil claims. Specifically, the traditionally short statutes of limitations for assault, battery and infliction of mental distress often preclude the adult victim of childhood incest from seeking a remedy within the statutorily prescribed time. Part II of this Note presents an overview of the nature of incest abuse and its resultant injuries and considers the purposes and policies behind statutes of limitations. Part II also sets out the various common law counter-measures and statutory tolling exceptions to statutes of limitations, including the discovery rule. Next, Part III evaluates these common law doctrines and tolling exceptions to determine whether they are applicable to incest-based tort claims. Based on this analysis, the Note argues that New York 2 ̆ 7 s common law doctrines of equitable estoppel and duress, as well as its statutory tolling exception for mental disability, if properly construed, would ordinarily enable the incest victim to prevail against a defendant 2 ̆ 7 s assertion of a statute of limitations defense. Because courts. tend to construe these doctrines and exceptions narrowly, however, Part III of this Note concludes that New York should enact a discovery rule applicable to incest-based tort victims. Finally, in Part IV, the Note offers a proposed statute that addresses the particular difficulty that adult victims of childhood incest abuse encounter in seeking <b>civil</b> <b>redress</b> for their injuries...|$|E
40|$|Excerpt] “A {{well-known}} cliché came to {{life when}} “[t]he pope’s butler was convicted... of stealing the pontiff’s private documents and leaking them to a journalist.... ” His lawyer’s unsuccessful argument—that taking “only photocopies, not original documents” should not be criminal—prompted this paper. When tangible property is taken, owners retain nothing. When documents or equivalents are duplicated, however, even if owners retain originals, they suffer loss of control and may lose substantial present and potential advantages, not necessarily economic. <b>Civil</b> <b>redress</b> for such losses has therefore long been available through copyright and trade secret laws. Indeed, {{it has often been}} available when injuries occasioned by unauthorized reproduction seem unrelated to goals traditionally advanced by either body of law. Thus, the way information is expressed may be protected by copyright and, until published, if it otherwise qualifies, information as such may also enjoy trade secret protection. When civil remedies are inadequate to deter theft and vindicate interests of owners and the public, civil remedies can be augmented with criminal penalties. Differences between tangibles and intangibles, however, are often seen to warrant different prosecutorial requirements and penalties. The second part of this paper explains how federal courts, recognizing those differences, have come to find the National Stolen Property Act (“NSPA”) inapplicable to theft of at least some intangibles. Ones addressed there fall within the scope of the Federal Copyright Act (“FCA”) and the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 (“EEA”). … The paper concludes, first, by echoing a suggestion that lack of uniformity in state law justifies federal penalties and expanded jurisdiction. It also advocates more uniformity and better articulation of the subject matter contemplated by the term “intangibles” in, for example, the Model Penal Code. Finally, the paper argues that even when tangibles such as media are taken, courts should, for example, not base their value on the value of its intangible contents. ...|$|E
40|$|In Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, the Supreme Court {{adopted a}} new {{standard}} of factual particularity a plaintiff must meet to satisfy the requirement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 (a) (2) that a complaint plead a “short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief. ” In Ashcroft v. Iqbal, the Court {{made clear that the}} Twombly pleading standard extended to <b>civil</b> actions seeking <b>redress</b> for deprivation of constitutional rights in particular, and universally to all Complaints filed in federal court. Commentators have debated whether after Iqbal, victims of constitutional wrongdoing will be able to survive a 12 (b) (6) motion to dismiss where the government and its officials exclusively harbor knowledge of the facts that animated the deprivation. Where constitutionality turns on the government’s motive or justification for its actions, how can the plaintiff assert factual allegations sufficient to “nudge [his] claims across the line from conceivable to plausible?” A second, less-discussed aspect of Iqbal is not new at all. Rather, Iqbal is but the latest instance {{in a long line of}} cases in which the Supreme Court, acting sua sponte, legislates a doctrine freeing government and its officials from accountability for proven violations of the Constitution. The Iqbal Court held that a supervisory official who is aware of, and deliberately indifferent to, the unconstitutional conduct of subordinates is not liable for damages caused by the deprivation. Rather, plaintiff must prove the supervisor independently violated the Constitution. Notably, Attorney General Ashcroft and FBI Director Mueller never argued before either the district court or court of appeals that plaintiff must prove a heightened level of culpability to establish their liability for infringements of constitutional rights physically inflicted by public employees under their command. Likewise, Ashcroft and Mueller did not ask the Supreme Court to revise the law of supervisory liability by elevating the requirements of plaintiff’s prima facie case. The Iqbal Court’s abandonment of well-entrenched limits on judicial authority in order to unilaterally shelter the government from accountability to persons deprived of their constitutional rights is not an aberration. This article will examine the Court’s penchant, without the benefit of the views of the lower courts and advocates, to excuse government entities and public officials from paying damages for injuries caused by their constitutional wrongdoing. As a result of the Court’s judicial legislation, the innocent citizen is often left to bear the losses caused by the government’s invasion of the most fundamental rights, those secured by the United States Constitution...|$|R
40|$|Consider two children—one born in sub-Saharan Africa and {{the other}} in the United States. The African child is twenty-five times more likely to die in {{the first five years of}} life; if she lives to child-bearing age, she is a two hundred times more likely to die in labor; and overall, she will die thirty years earlier than the American child. The {{international}} community is deeply resistant to taking bold remedial action—more concerned with their geostrategic interests than the health of the poor. The scale of foreign aid is both insufficient and unsustainable and fails to address the key determinants of health. As a result, the world’s distribution of the “good” of human health remains fundamentally unfair, causing enormous physical and mental suffering by those who experience the compounding disadvantages of poverty and ill health. If the health gap is unfair and unacceptable, then how can the international community be galvanized to make a genuine difference? In this article, I propose an international call to action through the adoption of a Global Plan for Justice (GPJ) —a voluntary compact among states and their partners in business, philanthropy, and <b>civil</b> society to <b>redress</b> health inequalities. The GPJ would be a form of “soft” norm setting, rather than a legally binding treaty, achieved with the passage of a World Health Assembly resolution. Under the GPJ, states would devote resources to a Global Health Fund based on their ability to pay—for example, 0. 25 % of Gross National Income (GNI) per annum—in addition to maintaining current development assistance devoted to programs and activities of their choice. Global Health Fund resources would be allocated based on the health needs of developing countries measured by poverty, morbidity, and premature mortality. The core missions of the Global Plan for Justice would be to (1) ensure the fair allocation of essential vaccines and medicines, with particular attention to low- and middle-income countries in a public health emergency; (2) meet basic survival needs, creating the conditions in which people can be healthy; and (3) help countries that will suffer most to adapt to the health impacts of climate change.

40|$|America 2 ̆ 7 s {{fantasy of}} a post-racial society was {{shattered}} on July 16, 2009, when a white police officer arrested Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates, a well-respected African-American academic, {{in his own}} home. Our historical racial fissure was widened. Once again, our thoughts were plagued with tortured images of our system of racialized law enforcement: the torture of Abner Louima, the beating of Rodney King, the killing of Amadou Diallo. Predictably, Americans became further polarized, as they simultaneously blamed and defended responses to racism. In what was perceived {{by some as a}} dramatic and unanticipated turn of events, and perceived by others as a necessary political response, on July 30, 2009, President Obama convened the 2 ̆ 2 beer summit, 2 ̆ 2 a metaphorical mediation. President Obama invited Professor Gates and Police Sergeant James Crowley to the White House South Lawn to resolve the issues surrounding the arrest of Professor Gates by Sergeant Crowley. As Professor Gates and Sergeant Crowley sat around the table drinking beer with President Obama, their discussion about race shifted from a demonizing conversation to a humanizing conversation. The two men gained insight into what had happened and began exploring what might be done to prevent this from happening again. The beer summit 2 ̆ 7 s success challenges the long-held taboo proscribing the mediation of civil rights violations such as racial profiling. Civil rights activists, critical race scholars, and the benefactors of civil rights advancement have long considered the mediation of civil rights violations as a neutering of civil rights law and a muting of compelling injustice narratives. This commentary encourages civil rights purveyors to step back from such absolutes and reconsider the appropriateness of mediation in select instances of civil rights offenses. Nothing in this commentary should be misconstrued as a blanket endorsement of mediation in lieu of litigation to <b>redress</b> <b>civil</b> rights violations. Rather, this is an invitation to re-examine the possibilities and reconsider mediation as one forum of choice in addressing race-based civil rights conflicts with law enforcement. Understandably, you may react to this difficult discussion from your personal vantage point about race. After all, whether you consider racial profiling to be a ubiquitous societal problem or a societal ill of the past depends on who you are, your personal experience, your professional perspective, and your definition of the problem. In this commentary, racial profiling is broadly defined as “the practice of ‘police routinely [using] race as a negative signal that, along with an accumulation of other signals, causes an officer to react with suspicion. ’” For some, the definition will be too encompassing; for others, not broad enough. This commentary proceeds with this discussion in five parts. Part One reviews the facts surrounding Professor Gates 2 ̆ 7 arrest. Part Two analyzes the transformation in the participants 2 ̆ 7 conflict discourse that was used to narrate their experience before and after the beer summit. Part Three then hypothesizes why racial profiling remains so pernicious today despite rigorous legislative and judicial enforcement. Part Four offers how mediation might be used as a responsive complement to the existing legal framework. In conclusion, Part Five invites the reader to consider the possibilities that mediation offers as one forum to respond to the multi-dimensional elements of racial profiling, as it exists today...|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{distinction between}} criminal law and civil {{law in the}} common law jurisdiction has been increasingly distorted. There is now a growing concern to suggest that such a differentiation is no longer obvious in today’s society. The use of Blackstone’s Commentaries to describe the two divisions of law as public wrongs versus private wrongs may appear to lack contemporary application especially in dealing with corporate regulation. In Australia, the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) uses civil penalties {{as a form of}} strategic regulation of corporate conduct. It is viewed as an alternative to criminal prosecution or <b>civil</b> <b>redress</b> for corporate wrongdoing. For this reason, civil penalties are often referred to as a hybridisation of the criminal and civil law. Arguably though, they exhibit remedial aspects of both criminal sanctions and civil compensation. Unfortunately, many civil penalty proceedings have presented with procedural problems during the course of litigation. Therefore, it is suggested that the time is right for legislative intervention in developing a new procedural rule specifically for civil penalty proceedings. This thesis explores the development of civil penalties and suggests that it should be formally recognised as a third branch of substantive law. It is argued that it deserves its own procedural rule in order to serve its purpose in corporate regulation. This thesis also attempts to point out the hidden dangers which could render civil penalties unconstitutional by infringing Chapter III of the Constitution. This could occur if parliament tries to usurp their power onto the judiciary by introducing a mandatory imposition of penalties or disqualification orders into the legislation. Then the court will be subjected to the will of the government and its independence in the exercise of judicial power. Although there are currently very few constitutional challenges to the existing civil penalty provisions under the Corporations Act, the High Court is re-developing the jurisprudence of the Kable principle in contemporary civil legislation. It appears to be an unsettled area of law which could affect the way civil penalties operate in the future if amendments are made to include mandatory terms...|$|E
