500|$|The {{first three}} field records of Blyth's pipit, {{including}} an atypical pale individual on the Isles of Scilly, proved difficult, but following {{the occurrence of}} trapped individuals, on Fair Isle in 1993 and Suffolk in 1994, these were accepted. Some records of <b>citrine</b> <b>wagtail</b> and short-toed treecreeper were accepted only after prolonged consideration. Prior to the publication in 1984 of Jonsson and Grant's stint identification paper, a number of stints (Calidris) proved difficult to assess; a paper covering four such cases was published in 1986. It included accounts of a bird on Fair Isle, originally thought Britain's first red-necked stint {{that turned out to}} be a sanderling; and a bird in Suffolk, The [...] "Felixstowe stint", which most observers at the time believed was a western sandpiper, but was in fact a semipalmated sandpiper.

50|$|The {{relationships}} {{of this species}} are not well resolved; {{it belongs to the}} non-African clade of wagtails, these are confusing in their external morphology, and mtDNA cytochrome b and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequence data are not able to robustly resolve their relationships. While the present species is probably most closely related to <b>citrine</b> <b>wagtails</b> and some blue-headed wagtails, the exact nature of this relationship is unclear.|$|R
5000|$|... "Citrine" [...] {{is used in}} {{the names}} of birds and other lifeforms with such {{colouring}} to describe their appearance, including the <b>citrine</b> <b>wagtail,</b> citrine warbler, citrine canary-flycatcher and citrine forktail.|$|E
50|$|This species' {{systematics}} and phylogeny {{is extremely}} confusing. Literally dozens of subspecies {{have been described}} {{at one time or}} another, and some 15-20 are currently considered valid depending on which author reviews them. In addition, the <b>citrine</b> <b>wagtail</b> (M. citreola) forms a cryptic species complex with this bird; both taxa as conventionally delimited are paraphyletic in respect to each other. The populations of the Beringian region are sometimes separated as eastern yellow wagtail (M. tschutschensis).|$|E
5000|$|This species breeds {{in north}} central Asia in wet meadows and tundra. It migrates in winter to South Asia, often to {{highland}} areas. Its range is expanding westwards, {{and it is}} a rare but increasing vagrant to western Europe. Vagrants seem to extend the migration rather than straying in Bhutan for example, though along one of the species' migration flyways, the <b>citrine</b> <b>wagtail</b> has been recorded as an extremely rare passer-by rather than staying even for a few days or weeks.|$|E
50|$|Levenhall Links {{are one of}} {{the most}} popular sites for birdwatching in the {{vicinity}} of Edinburgh. The ash lagoons have provided a roost site for gulls, shorebirds and terns; while the seawall provides excellent views of the flocks of sea ducks such as common eider, velvet scoter, red-breasted merganser, long-tailed duck and common goldeneye. Many rare visitors have been seen over the years including Wilson's phalarope, western sandpiper, marsh sandpiper, Franklin's gull and <b>citrine</b> <b>wagtail.</b> It has hosted three terns which had their first occurrences for Scotland here; namely Forster's tern, lesser crested tern and royal tern. It is also the most regular site in Scotland for the Mediterranean gull.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} {{reference point}} for the citrine colour was the citron fruit. The first recorded use of citrine as a colour in English was in 1386. It was borrowed from a medieval Latin and classical Latin word with the same meaning. In late medieval and early modern English the citrine colour-name was applied in {{a wider variety of}} contexts than it is today and could be [...] "reddish or brownish yellow; or orange; or amber (distinguished from yellow)". In today's English citrine as a colour is mostly confined to the contexts of (1) gemstones, including quartz, and (2) some animal and plant names. E.g., the <b>citrine</b> <b>wagtail</b> (Motacilla citreola), an Asian bird species with golden-yellow plumage.|$|E

50|$|The wetland {{supports}} a high diversity of birds, {{with at least}} 239 species reported since 2001 in the area recognised as an Important Bird and Biodiversity Area. The wetland is also recognised as a birding hotspot in eBird with 282 bird species recorded as of May 2017. The bird life of Basai Wetland includes the following species of conservation concern as per the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species:Two critically endangered vulture species were reported to occur in Basai Wetland in the past: White-rumped vulture and Red-headed vulture. Presently, {{a large number of}} resident bird species, including many typical of wetlands, some of which breed in the hundreds occur in Basai Wetland, including Grey-headed swamphen, Cattle egret, Black bittern, Cinnamon bittern, Yellow bittern, and Yellow-bellied Prinia. The wetland is also used by birds such as Grey-headed Lapwing, Watercock, and Greater flamingo. Basai wetland also provides an important habitat for migratory birds. In winter, around 1100 Bar-headed Goose have been reported, while up to 5,000 ducks of 18 species and 10,000 waders of 36 species occur during spring and autumn passage migration. Among the many migrant bird species found here over the winter are Wood sandpiper, Smoky warbler, Moustached warbler, Common grasshopper warbler, Water rail, Baillon's crake, Great bittern, Water Pipit, and Common crane. During winter, several thousand <b>Citrine</b> <b>wagtail</b> and Yellow wagtail are also known to roost in Basai Wetland.|$|E

A possible hybrid between Little Egret Egretta garzetta and Western Reef Heron Egretta gularis was observed. The first nesting of Ruddy Shelduck Tadorna ferruginea in the Danube Delta was documented. Goldeneye Bucephala clangula and Smew Mergus albellus are re-colonising the areas they abandoned in the early 20 th century. New data regarding the relocation of Pallas’s Gull Larus ichthyaetus colony in the Danube Delta as a result of hydromorphological changes in the bay, nesting and defence strategies against Caspian Gulls Larus cachinnans are described. Probable nesting of <b>Citrine</b> <b>Wagtail</b> Motacilla citreola in the Danube Delta was documented in 2014 for the first time...|$|E
