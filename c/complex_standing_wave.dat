40|$|We have {{investigated}} the electronic structure of atomic size particles on clean Au(111) surfaces by means of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) at low temperatures. Au adatoms were created on Au(111) with high reproducibility by bringing the STM tip in (near) contact with the surface, providing a rather easy means of creating larger nanostructures out of atomic size particles. Scattering of Au(111) surface state electrons at the adatom site {{gives rise to the}} formation of <b>complex</b> <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> patterns. The electronic structure of the adatoms appears to be dominated by a pronounced resonance below the onset of the Au(111) surface state. The observed resonance is interpreted as a bound state that is split off from the 2 D surface state of the Au(111) surface. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Tails of the {{tropical}} fish Xiphophorous maculatus have been studied by light microscopy during irradiation with continuous wave 780 kHz ultrasound. Acoustically-induced microstreaming was observed in blood vessels during irradiation with peak intensities above 1 Wcm- 2. The microstreaming {{took the form of}} rotation of single blood cells and clusters of a few cells and occurred at positions close to the edges of cartilage rods supporting the tail. Streaming was detected initially in vessels 5 - 10 micrometers across where it impeded blood flow, and as the blood velocity fell it was also observed in larger vessels 15 - 30 micrometers across. Measurements of rotation speed showed that streaming velocity increased with intensity. The microstreaming is thought to result from radiation torque created by the <b>complex</b> <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> field produced by reflection from the irradiation tank window and the cartilage rods, or by vibration of the rods in the sound field...|$|E
40|$|We use {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) calculations {{with higher}} resolution, {{as well as}} with more realistic viscosity and sound-speed prescriptions than previous work to examine the eccentric instability which underlies the superhump phenomenon in semidetached binaries. We illustrate the importance of the two-armed spiral mode in the generation of superhumps. Differential motions in the fluid disc cause converging flows which lead to strong spiral shocks once each superhump cycle. The dissipation associated with these shocks powers the superhump. We compare two-dimensional (2 D) and 3 D results, and conclude that 3 D simulations are necessary to faithfully simulate the disc dynamics. We ran our simulations for unprecedented durations, so that an eccentric equilibrium is established except at high mass ratios where the growth rate of the instability is very low. We collate the observed data on superhumps. Our improved simulations give a closer match to the observed relationship between superhump period excess and binary mass ratio than previous numerical work. The observed black hole X-ray transient superhumpers appear to have systematically lower disc precession rates than the cataclysmic variables. This could be due to higher disc temperatures and thicknesses. No high-resolution 3 D disc with mass ratio q > 0. 24 developed superhumps, in agreement with analytical expectations. The modulation in total viscous dissipation on the superhump period is overwhelmingly from the region of the disc within the 3 : 1 resonance radius R 3 : 1. The precession rates of our high-resolution 3 D discs match the single particle dynamical precession rate at 0. 87 R 3 : 1. As the eccentric instability develops, the viscous torques are enhanced, and the disc consequently adjusts to a new equilibrium state, as suggested in the thermal–tidal instability model. We quantify this enhancement in the viscosity, which is 10 per cent for q = 0. 08. The disc motions can be described as superpositions of the S(k, l) modes, and the disc executes <b>complex</b> <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> dynamics which repeat in the inertial frame on the disc precession period. We characterize the eccentricity distributions in our accretion discs, and show that the entire body of the disc partakes in the eccentricity...|$|E

The equatorial differential rotation is estimated as a function of effective depth on the basis of the theoretical contribution functions for the p-modes recently derived by Ulrich et al. (1978).

40|$|Vibration {{modes of}} a unite-length Timoshenko beam are studied as <b>standing</b> <b>waves</b> using the wave-train closure principle, {{in order to}} obtain a {{complete}} picture of various vibration modes in a beam and to understand the mechanism of their formulations. In particular, the existence of degenerate modes in a beam is investigated. Firstly, it is shown that the two degenerate flexural waves accommodated by an infinite Timoshenko beam are derived from the in-phase'and the out-of-phase relations between transverse vibrations due to bending and shear deformations, respectively. A wave representation of beam vibration is thus developed. Secondly, wave reflection behavior at an elastically supported boundary is analyzed. It is shown that while these two waves are degenerate in an infinite beam, they have to be superposed at the boundary in general, but remain degenerate for certain special boundary conditions. Based on these results, the expression of wave-train closure principle for a finite-length Timoshenko beam is derived, and used to study different <b>standing</b> <b>waves</b> in a beam. It is shown that three types of <b>standing</b> <b>waves</b> (vibration modes) exist in Timoshenko beams, namely, superposed, degenerate, and single.
