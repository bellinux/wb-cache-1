This paper proves and promotes easily computable bounds based on the so-called <b>call</b> <b>packing</b> principle. Under <b>call</b> <b>packing,</b> a standard product form expression is available. It is proven that <b>call</b> <b>packing</b> leads to a guaranteed upper bound for the loss probability. In addition, an analytic error bound for the accuracy is derived. This also leads to a secure lower bound. The <b>call</b> <b>packing</b> bound is also proven to be superior to the standard loss bound.

40|$|Generative {{adversarial}} networks (GANs) are innovative {{techniques for}} learning generative models of complex data distributions from samples. Despite remarkable recent improvements in generating realistic images, {{one of their}} major shortcomings {{is the fact that}} in practice, they tend to produce samples with little diversity, even when trained on diverse datasets. This phenomenon, known as mode collapse, has been the main focus of several recent advances in GANs. Yet there is little understanding of why mode collapse happens and why existing approaches are able to mitigate mode collapse. We propose a principled approach to handling mode collapse, which we <b>call</b> <b>packing.</b> The main idea is to modify the discriminator to make decisions based on multiple samples from the same class, either real or artificially generated. We borrow analysis tools from binary hypothesis testing [...] -in particular the seminal result of Blackwell [Bla 53] [...] -to prove a fundamental connection between packing and mode collapse. We show that packing naturally penalizes generators with mode collapse, thereby favoring generator distributions with less mode collapse during the training process. Numerical experiments on benchmark datasets suggests that packing provides significant improvements in practice as well. Comment: 40 pages, 19 figure...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The on call {{service for}} health {{protection}} {{in most parts}} of the UK is provided by general public health consultants, registrars and nurses as the first tier of response backed up by medical consultants in health protection. The first tier responder usually carries a large bag of papers containing both local and national guidance on the management of common cases/incidents. An electronic on <b>call</b> <b>pack</b> may provide a suitable practical alternative to large paper based systems and help professionals deliver out of hours health protection advice and response to incidents. Methods We developed and piloted an electronic on <b>call</b> <b>pack</b> in Hertfordshire for use at the health protection unit level containing key local and national guidelines, contact information and useful references. The on-call pack was initially piloted using a laptop and more recently using a personal digital assistant (PDA). The use of the on-call pack was evaluated. Results Key advantages of the electronic system include reduced size, faster access to information that is clearly indexed and the relative ease of updating information. As part of the pilot, the electronic on <b>call</b> <b>pack</b> was presented to a local and regional training meeting with good response from participants using qualitative and quantitative methods. Conclusion It is anticipated that with suitable evaluation this system can be adapted and utilised by other health protection practitioners. This system provides a fast, reliable and easily maintained source of information for the public health on-call team. </p...|$|R

50|$|Memory-wise, arrays are compact data {{structures}} with no per-element overhead. There {{may be a}} per-array overhead, e.g. {{to store}} index bounds, but this is language-dependent. It can also happen that elements stored in an array require less memory than the same elements stored in individual variables, because several array elements {{can be stored in}} a single word; such arrays are often <b>called</b> <b>packed</b> arrays. An extreme (but commonly used) case is the bit array, where every bit represents a single element. A single octet can thus hold up to 256 different combinations of up to 8 different conditions, in the most compact form.|$|R
