40|$|Several {{kinds of}} models {{have already been}} {{proposed}} for explaining the photoemission process. The exact photoemission theory of <b>semiconductor</b> <b>photocathode</b> was not well established after decades of research. In this paper an integral equation of quantum efficiency (QE) is constructed to describe the photoemission of positive electron affinity (PEA) <b>semiconductor</b> <b>photocathode</b> based on three-step photoemission model. The influences of forbidden gap, electron affinity, photon energy, incident angle, degree of polarization, refractive index, extinction coefficient, initial/final electron energy, relaxation time and external electric field on the QE of PEA <b>semiconductor</b> <b>photocathode</b> are taken into account. In addition, a computer code is also programmed to calculate the QE of K 2 CsSb photocathode theoretically at 532 nm wavelength, the result {{is in line with}} the experimental value by and large.
