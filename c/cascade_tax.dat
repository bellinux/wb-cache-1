5000|$|Goods and Services Tax (GST) is an {{indirect}} tax which {{was introduced in}} India on 1 July 2017 and was applicable throughout India which replaced multiple <b>cascading</b> <b>taxes</b> levied by the central and state governments. It was introduced as The Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act 2017, following the passage of Constitution 122nd Amendment Bill. The GST is governed by a GST Council and its Chairman is the Finance Minister of India. Under GST, goods and services are taxed at the following rates, 0%, 5%, 12% ,18% and 28%. There is a special rate of 0.25% on rough precious and semi-precious stones and 3% on gold. [...] In addition a cess of 15% or other rates on top of 28% GST applies on few items like aerated drinks, luxury cars and tobacco products. GST was initially proposed to replace a slew of indirect taxes with a unified tax and was therefore set to dramatically reshape the country's 2 trillion dollar economy. The rate of GST in India is between double to four times that levied in other countries like Singapore.|$|R

40|$|M. Com. (Economics) The {{objective}} of the thesis {{is to examine the}} fiscal importance' of indirect taxation with specific reference to value added taxation. The investigation takes cognisance of the unique characteristics of the South African economy, especially its strong dualistic characteristics, very unequal distributlon of income and extensive backlogs in the areas of social services and infrastructure. The South African tax system has undergone a rather fundamental shift in the early 1970 s when the sales duty was replaced by a general sales tax. This tax, implemented in July 1978 at the rate of 4 per cent provided for the exemption of basic foodstuffs and the issuing of exemption certificates mandating the non-taxation of certain goods. These certificates led to abuse and fraud. The <b>tax</b> was a <b>cascading</b> <b>tax</b> and double taxation was an inherent characteristic of it. Within 13 years of its existence the rate of the tax soured to 13 per cent. An European-styled value added tax, engineered on the New Zealand model, was implemented in September 1991. Value added tax has in the past been criticised on account of its regressive properties. Unions have depicted value added tax as an unfair tax because of its skewed income and wealth effects. Providing relief for the perceived regressivity of valued added tax is not an easy decision. The regressivity of value added tax can be reduced by zero ratings, differential rates and exemptions, but it was found that there are convincing reasons why the value added tax base should be kept as broad as possible. Internationally it is accepted that economic distortions are kept to a minimum when value added tax is levied on a broad base with a minimum number of zero ratings and differential rates. A broadly based tax effects current and future consumption to the same degree and is therefore neutral as to consumption and saving. Irrespective of this best-policy-advice, various countries still make considerable use of zero ratings and differential rates to lessen the regressivity of the tax system. Theoretically value added tax does not add to inflationary pressures. Notwithstanding this theoretical view {{there is some evidence that}} value added tax could sometimes lead to cost push inflation should compensating salary increases follow after a broadening of the base. The dissertation agrees with South African studies indicating that the cascading effects of value added tax is negligible. Although the rate of inflation increased during the twelve month period following the introduction of the tax in South Africa, it had an once-off impact on the general level of prices and could thus not be typified as inflation. Financial services are by and large exempted from value added tax due to its many definitional problems. In this connection, the Poddar-English model is regarded by some observers as a means of addressing this problem. The model does not provide solutions for all the problems and remains to a large extent impractical. Notwithstanding this, the extension of the tax base to include financial services will enhance the efficiency of the tax...|$|R
40|$|The three essays of this {{dissertation}} inform {{tax policy}} design. It is {{a compilation of}} empirical and experimental research work. The first and the second essays explore {{the performance of a}} recent tax policy reform at the sub-national level in India in terms of revenue efficiency as well as economic efficiency. India is among the only three countries in the world to have adopted a sub-national VAT. Therefore, empirically examining its performance not only improves the understanding of this important tax policy reform but also informs tax policy decision-making at the sub-national level in other developing countries. India transitioned to the state-level VAT between the years 2003 and 2008. Among other things, it was expected to achieve revenue growth and decrease <b>tax</b> <b>cascading</b> on commodities by improving economic efficiency of the indirect tax system. In the first essay, I model the impact of the VAT on revenue by adding revenue dependent administrative and compliance costs associated with taxation to an existing model developed by Keen and Lockwood (2010). The theoretical results show that replacing one type of indirect tax with another improves long-run revenue efficiency only if there is a net decrease in the administrative, compliance and distortionary costs of taxation at the margin. I then compile a unique state-level dataset for the years 1990 to 2010 to determine changes in the long-run revenue efficiency from the use of the VAT. This essay contributes to the literature by extending an existing revenue efficiency model and testing it in the unique situation of India’s sub-national VAT. The results reveal a significant improvement in the long-run revenue efficiency of the sales tax instrument used by state governments. The model implies this improvement is driven by a net fall in the marginal taxation costs from the use of the state-level VAT. This finding has important implications on the role of a sub-national VAT in the future as an effective tax instrument in the developing countries. The second essay appeals to the general theory of tax incidence which suggests that a VAT will have less impact on prices than a traditional turnover tax because the VAT does not “get stuck” in the production process as a turnover tax does. The impact should be larger for goods that have more components to the production process as the tax then “touches” more of the final product. In this essay I measure the change in the level of <b>tax</b> <b>cascading</b> with VAT by using multiple waves of the state- and household-level expenditure surveys. Specifically I test the impact of the VAT on the real consumption of households on a variety of consumption goods. I find the biggest significant decrease in the <b>tax</b> <b>cascading</b> burden of the long-term durable goods which essentially involve the maximum production components. This result is found in the 18 more developed states of India which are the focus of the empirical analysis due to data constraints. The third essay is an experimental research which looks at the influence of institutions on the economic burden of an excise tax. The traditional long-run tax incidence theory establishes that the economic incidence of an excise tax is independent of the assignment of the liability to pay tax. However, the theory is silent on the possible effects of the market institutions on tax incidence. Since all markets need an institution to function and every market institution has its own unique price and quantity determination property, {{it is important to understand}} its bearings on the incidence of taxes. Existing experimental research has tested economic incidence under many different market institutions but no previous research systematically analyzes and compares the incidence of a unit tax under two important market institutions we deal with in everyday life. One of these institutions is posted offer which dominates the consumer goods markets in developed countries and the other is double auction which is frequently observed in developing countries. I report a significant impact of these market institutions on tax incidence. In particular, I find that consumers bear a much higher burden of a unit tax in the posted offer markets as compared to the double auction markets and their burden further increases when the liability to pay the tax is on the seller...|$|R
40|$|Indirect {{taxes on}} goods and {{services}} {{at the state level}} constitute 85 percent of own tax revenue of the state governments of which sales tax alone accounts for 61 percent. A change in regime in recent times from <b>cascading</b> types sales <b>taxes</b> to taxes based on input-tax credit within taxation of goods, as well as the adoption of a uniform rates of tax, has resulted in buoyant revenues. However, the reform agenda is far from complete. The proposed GST regime constitutes the next step towards comprehensive reforms of indirect taxes in India. It would be the final step or {{a step in the right}} direction, depending on how the country chooses to define the constituents of this new regime. Decisions on the design of the proposed tax are not yet in the public domain. In this context, the objective of this paper is twofold : First, to identify the likely form of the proposed tax and the contentious issues that need a resolution before the tax can be implemented effectively. Second, given the importance of indirect taxes in the portfolio of the states, since any change would not affect all states uniformly, an attempt would be made to project the likely impact of one particular design of GST on states. While these estimates can at best be tentative, they will highlight the fact that the impact is differential across states and these differences would have to be taken into account in designing the proposed assignment of tax powers between the centre and the states.

40|$|In {{my thesis}} I {{illuminate}} {{the effects on}} social welfare created {{by the introduction of}} a financial activity tax (FAT) on financial services. Many financial services are exempt from value added tax (VAT). Even though it may be wanted, there are technical difficulties in implementing a VAT on these services. In order {{to make up for the}} missing taxation, a FAT was introduced on financial services in Norway January 1 2017. The Norwegian FAT is a 5 % tax on wages and an additional 1 % on corporate income tax rate. Such a tax effects consumer prices and the government tax revenue. Taken together, these two factors are treated as social welfare. To what degree does FAT make up for missing VAT when comparing to a neutral tax regime? Using a theoretical presentation of an input-output analysis, I highlight the distortionary effects on welfare caused by either regime. A VAT gives a too low consumer price of financial services, but <b>cascading</b> of <b>taxes</b> gives a too high price of commodities produced using financial services as inputs. Alternatively, a FAT increases the price for final consumers of financial services, but it does not solve the problem with tax-cascading. In the empirical analysis I interpret output from model simulations done by using the MSG 6 -model to look at effects of a FAT on consumer prices. To incorporate a FAT in the MSG 6 -model, the user price of capital is increased by the same amount as the loan interest rate has to be increased in order to keep the interest margin constant when the payroll tax increase. The effects on consumer prices are results of full pass through, and changes in spending are results of price increases and that the additional tax revenue is distributed using lump-sum transfers. Modest increases in consumer prices and reductions in consumption of most goods are observed. The larger the dependence of capital as input in production, the larger is the price increase. Price of food, non-alcoholic beverages, consumption of own means of transport increases with respectively 0. 0276 %, 0. 0352 % and 0. 0322 %, and a reduction in spending is observed. The largest price increase is in consumption of housing, with almost 0. 29 %, which may be economically efficient because of a previously rather low taxation compared to other investment opportunities. The effect on social welfare depend on consumers’ valuation of their reallocated consumption bundle compared to the initial spending in the reference scenario. The tax will in addition reduce some of the risk posed on the economy by the financial sector...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Financial {{services}} {{have generally been}} exempt under value-added tax (VAT) systems due to the inability to identify the appropriate tax base, which is hidden in the financial margin. A cash-flow VAT approach represents one means of defining this tax base {{in a way that}} is compatible with credit-invoice VATs. This paper describes the use of a cash-flow VAT for a banking deposit/loan operation and indicates the practical difficulties blocking use of the full cash-flow method. It then describes a variant of the cash-flow system, referred to as the “Truncated Cash-Flow Method with Tax Calculation Account,” which is designed to overcome these difficulties. One of the most difficult areas in the operation of value-added tax (VAT) systems has been the treatment of financial services. A workable method of taxing such services has eluded tax authorities for decades. As a conse-quence, almost all the countries employing a VAT have opted to exempt financial services rendered to residents of their countries. Although the exemption approach has been widely adopted, there have been significant problems in its operation. The resulting <b>tax</b> <b>cascading</b> creates numerous economic distortions and adversely affects the competitive position of domestic institutions in international markets, while the definitions and allocations needed to operate the system have proven to be very complex. This paper presents an approach to applying a VAT to financial services that is designed to operationalize the cash-flow method. The cash-flow method has been considered a conceptually sound method of applying a VAT to financial services with some attractive attributes in the context of credit-invoice VAT systems. However, the method has also been seen to exhibit several fundamental difficulties, which have kept it from being used except in a few limited situations. The approach suggested here is designed to overcom...|$|R
