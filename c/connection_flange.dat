40|$|Pipe <b>flange</b> <b>connections</b> with gaskets in {{chemical}} plants, electric {{power plants and}} other industrial plants are usually exposed to elevated internal pressure with cyclic thermal condition. It is important to investigate the sealing performance of pipe connections under long term severe thermal exposure swings to ensure operational safety. In this study, the effects of cyclic thermal conditions on the sealing performance and mechanical characteristics in larger and smaller nominal diameter of pipe <b>flange</b> <b>connection</b> are examined using FEM calculations. Helium gas leakage is predicted using the contact gasket stress obtained from the FEM results. On other hand, the leakage tests using the smaller nominal diameter of pipe <b>flange</b> <b>connection</b> were conducted to measure the amount of helium gas leakage and to compare with the predicted amount of gas leakage. As the results, the contact gasket stress distributions were changed dramatically under cyclic thermal condition and elevated internal pressure. In the pipe <b>flange</b> <b>connections</b> with smaller nominal diameter, the contact gasket stress was the smallest in the restart condition. On other hand, the minimum contact gasket stress in the pipe <b>flange</b> <b>connection</b> with larger nominal diameter was depending on the materials of connection.

40|$|Process {{safety is}} a task of {{preventing}} leaks. Leak prevention is critical because pressure vessels and piping assets in chemical plants are fabricated from materials which have limited corrosion resistance. When corrosive compounds are processed in these assets, they may suffer degradation over time due to thinning, cracking, or loss of their material properties. This problem is partially controlled by applying a safety margin known called a corrosion allowance. The corrosion allowance is determined by predicting the asset?s expected corrosion rate and its service life. However, this fixed safety margin does not consider the inherent uncertainty in an individual asset?s degradation rate due to variability in the material?s corrosion resistance, the operating parameters of the process, and the inspection techniques {{used to measure the}} progression of corrosion damage over time. Consequently, deterministic analysis is not capable of precisely estimating an asset?s safe operating life during its design stage. One of the most likely areas for leakage to occur in process equipment is at the <b>flange</b> <b>connections</b> that join assets together. Risk analyses for planning inspections of fixed equipment and piping usually treat flanges as components of their parent asset. This thesis focuses on methods to improve prediction and control of corrosion and leakage at <b>flange</b> <b>connections</b> in particular. <b>Flange</b> <b>connection</b> seal tightness can be monitored through vibration-based Non-Destruction Testing (NDT). The data gathered from this monitoring can be used to update risk models for <b>flange</b> <b>connection</b> leakage. Hierarchical Bayesian Network methods of modeling risk are demonstrated in this thesis to be capable of predicting probability of seal failure based on the mean and variance of failure rates in a population of <b>flange</b> <b>connections.</b> This allows for prediction of the probabilities based on corrosion and leak events in the plant. The results of inspection techniques are used as inputs to this risk model, enabling probabilistic decision-making...|$|R

A major task of the Phase- 1 commissioning was the vacuum scrubbing of new beam pipes in anticipation of a sufficiently long beam lifetime and low background noise in the next commissioning, prior to which a new particle detector will be installed. The pressure rise per unit beam current decreased steadily with increasing beam dose, as expected.

The temperature increases of the bellows chambers, gate valves, <b>connection</b> <b>flanges,</b> and so on were less than several degrees at 1  A, and no serious problems were found.

The use of permanent magnets to create an axial magnetic field of approximately 100  G successfully suppressed this effect.
