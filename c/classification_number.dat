5|$|Sheriff Andrew Jackson (Lenny Von Dohlen) {{rules the}} death an accident, but Shawn {{receives}} the Dewey Decimal <b>Classification</b> <b>number</b> of a book, Reincarnation and Rebirth, {{the title of}} which parallels the revelation that Paula had supposedly drowned in Santa Barbara, California seven years earlier, though her body was never found. Bob reveals that Michelle's unstable sister Lucy left Dual Spires, taking with her Paula, whom Michelle and Bob had all but raised. When Paula sent them a letter detailing the drug use and child abuse, they helped Paula fake her death so she could leave Lucy. Detectives Juliet O'Hara (Maggie Lawson) and Carlton Lassiter (Timothy Omundson) reopen the case and leave to issue a warrant for Bob's arrest.|$|E
5|$|The Decimal Classification {{introduced}} {{the concepts of}} relative location and relative index which allow new books {{to be added to}} a library in their appropriate location based on subject. Libraries previously had given books permanent shelf locations that were related to the order of acquisition rather than topic. The classification's notation makes use of three-digit Arabic numerals for main classes, with fractional decimals allowing expansion for further detail. Using Arabic numerals for symbols, it is flexible to the degree that numbers can be expanded in linear fashion to cover special aspects of general subjects. A library assigns a <b>classification</b> <b>number</b> that unambiguously locates a particular volume in a position relative to other books in the library, {{on the basis of its}} subject. The number makes it possible to find any book and to return it to its proper place on the library shelves. The classification system is used in 200,000 libraries in at least 135 countries.|$|E

500|$|The {{classification}} {{was originally}} enumerative, {{meaning that it}} listed all of the classes explicitly in the schedules. Over time it added some aspects of a faceted classification scheme, allowing classifiers to construct a number by combining a class number for a topic with an entry from a separate table. Tables cover commonly used elements such as geographical and temporal aspects, language, and bibliographic forms. For example, a class number could be constructed using 330 for economics + [...]9 for geographic treatment + [...]04 for Europe to create the class 330.94 European economy. Or one could combine the class 973 for United States + [...]05 for periodical publications on the topic {{to arrive at the}} number 973.05 for periodicals concerning the United States generally. The classification also makes use of mnemonics in some areas, such that the number 5 represents the country Italy in classification numbers like 945 (history of Italy), 450 (Italian language), 195 (Italian philosophy). The combination of faceting and mnemonics makes the classification synthetic in nature, with meaning built into parts of the <b>classification</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E

40|$|Publisher東京原著論文【目的】国立国会図書館件名標目表(NDLSH) において, 細目をもたない普通件名など, ある範囲の件名標目に対して, 概念上で対応する日本十進分類法(NDC) 新訂 9 版の分類記号が「代表分類記号」として示されている。本研究は, 国立国会図書館作成の書誌レコードに付与されたNDLSH件名標目とNDC分類記号の組み合わせの中で, NDLSHが示す代表分類記号が付与されている数および割合を調査する。 【方法】 1997 年から 2014 年 3 月分までの書誌レコードから, NDC新訂 9 版分類記号とNDLSH件名標目の組み合わせをすべて抽出し, それらを普通件名と地名による件名に分けて集計した。また, 各件名標目の代表分類記号は, Web NDL Authoritiesを用いて取得した。 【結果】 1) 普通件名の場合, 代表分類記号をもつ件名標目は全体の 20 %以下にとどまり, その殆どは細目をもたない。書誌レコードに付与された分類記号との照合では, 件名単位で 80 ％以上, 件名・分類記号ペア単位で 10 ％強が代表分類記号と完全一致となった。分類記号の前方一致まで含めたときには, 件名単位でもペア単位でも一致となるものが増加した。対象をレコード内先頭出現の件名標目に限定したとき, 一致数および平均一致率の大幅な上昇が見られた。それに対して, 細目を除去し主標目のレベルですべての件名標目を照合したところ, これらの値はむしろ低下した。 2) 分類記号の側から集計したときには, 代表件名標目をもつ分類記号は 30 ％強であった。書誌レコードに付与された件名標目との照合では, 分類記号単位で 90 ％弱, 分類記号・件名ペア単位では 10 ％強が完全一致となった。継承一致という独自の照合を導入すると, 一致となるものが相当数増加した。 3) 代表分類記号をもつ地名件名は僅か 6 ％にとどまり, 件名・分類記号のペア単位でも 12 ％にとどまる。これらのうち, 完全一致となるのは, 件名単位で 50 ％強, ペア単位で 15 ％程度であった。 Purpose : NDLSH are {{lists of}} subject headings, {{some of which}} have their {{corresponding}} <b>classification</b> <b>numbers</b> in NDC 9 th ed., and are called "representative <b>classification</b> <b>numbers.</b> " This paper investigates {{the extent to which the}} representative numbers in NDLSH match the <b>classification</b> <b>numbers</b> assigned to bibliographic records. It reports the detailed results on their matching, while referring to a preceding research on the same topic. Methods : Pairs of NDC numbers and NDLSH subject headings were extracted from bibliographic records created between 1997 and 2014. General topical subject headings and geographic ones were examined separately. The representative <b>classification</b> <b>numbers</b> for individual subject headings were obtained from Web NDL Authorities. Results : 1) For general topical headings, less than 20 ％ of them have representative NDC numbers, most of which do not have sub-headings. More than 80 ％ of subject headings with representative NDC numbers have records with NDC numbers matching the representative ones, while more than 10 ％ of the NDLSH-NDC combinations that occurred in records were in agreement with those shown in NDLSH. Left-hand match on <b>classification</b> <b>numbers</b> increased the number of matching cases. Limiting the NDLSH-NDC pairs to those that occurred first in each record brought a substantial increase in the number of matching cases. 2) Only 6 ％ of geographic subject headings have representative NDC numbers. More than 50 ％ of such headings have records with NDC numbers that match the representative ones, while 15 ％ of the NDLSH-NDC combinations occurred in records that agreed with those shown in NDLSH...|$|R

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the differences of Literature classification schemes between Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) and New Classification Scheme for Chinese Libraries (CCL). Two areas were examined, including the scope of classification and the ways to build up <b>classification</b> <b>numbers.</b> The findings reveal that DDC prefers nglish literature and has a high consistency of citation order. Literary works are arranged by language, then by form and historical period. In contrast, CCL focuses on Chinese literature and arranges literary works by country and then by form. The literature published by some countries can be further divided by historical period. This study suggests that CCL can improve the consistency of building up <b>classification</b> <b>numbers</b> using subdivision tables for literature.
