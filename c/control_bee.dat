Serum rheumatoid factor, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, prostaglandins E 2 and F 2 α, lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide, glutathione and total antioxidant capacity levels were determined in all groups. Rheumatoid arthritis in female patients was resulted in a significant elevation in serum rheumatoid factor, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, prostaglandins E 2 and F 2 α, lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide levels (p < 0. 05) compared to control group. In addition, rheumatoid arthritis caused {{a significant reduction in}} serum glutathione and total antioxidant capacity levels. On the other hand, bee venom stings alleviated rheumatoid arthritis inflammation and oxidative stress effects, where all investigated parameters were statistically significant compared to rheumatoid arthritis group.

40|$|Since a few decades, {{apiculture}} {{is facing}} important economic losses worldwide with general major consequences {{in many areas}} of agriculture. A strong attention has been paid towards the phenomenon named Colony Collapse Disorder in which colonies suddenly disappear with no clear explanations. Honeybee colonies can be affected by abiotic factors, such as environmental pollution or insecticide applications for agricultural purposes. Also biotic stresses cause colony losses, including bacterial (e. g. Paenibacillus larvae) and fungal (e. g. Ascosphaera apis) pathogens, microsporidia (e. g. Nosema apis), parasites (i. e. Varroa destructor) and several viruses. In the light of recent research, intestinal dysbiosis, considered as the relative disproportion of the species within the native microbiota, has shown to affect human and animal health. In arthropods, alteration of the gut microbial climax community {{has been shown to be}} linked to health and fitness disequilibrium, like in the medfly Ceratitis capitata for which low mate competitiveness is determined by a gut microbial community imbalance. According to these observations, it is possible to hypothesize that dysbiosis may have a role in disease occurrence also in honeybees. Here we aim to discuss the current knowledge on dysbiosis in the honeybee and its relation with honeybee health by reviewing the investigations of the microbial diversity associated to honeybees and the recent experiments performed to <b>control</b> <b>bee</b> diseases by microbial symbionts.

40|$|The aim of our {{research}} was to investigate if a synthetic Juvenile hormone (JH) -analog (the insecticide Fenoxycarb) potentially affects physiological processes in the honeybee. We evaluated effects on both the molecular level (gene and protein expression in the brain) and the organ level (hypopharyngeal gland development). Both mRNA and protein expression profiles were analysed in age-matched treated and <b>control</b> <b>bees</b> to identify relevant components using microarray and 2 D-DIGE (2 -dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis). Analysis of brains resulted in a list of 21 genes that were consistently differentially expressed in microarray experiments for 2 different colonies, while 7 differential protein spots were shared in 2 D-DIGE experiments on 3 different colonies. So far, four protein spots were successfully identified using MS, of which two also appeared in the microarray list. When we focused on a specific gene involved in the transition from nurse to forager, bees treated with the JH-analog showed different expression to <b>control</b> <b>bees.</b> Moreover, histological studies on the important and JH-sensitive hypopharyngeal glands were also performed to look for morphological differences between treated and <b>control</b> <b>bees.</b> Age related degeneration of the hypopharyngeal gland progressed faster in bees, treated with Fenoxycarb, in comparison to <b>control</b> <b>bees.</b> Our data show that effects of JH-analogs on bees can be detected at the molecular and developmental level which provides a potential tool for side-effect evaluation. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Host–parasite {{interactions}} are often characterized {{by changes in}} the host behaviour, which are beneficial to either the parasite or the host, or are a non-adaptive byproduct of parasitism. These {{interactions are}} further complicated in animal society because individual fitness is associated with group performance. However, {{a better understanding of}} host–parasite interaction in animal society first requires the identification of individual host behavioural modification. Therefore, we challenged honey bee (Apis mellifera) workers with the parasite Nosema ceranae or an immune stimulation and tracked their flight activity over their lifetime with an optic counter. We found that bees responded differently to each stress: both Nosema-infected and immune-challenged bees performed a lower number of daily flights compared with <b>control</b> <b>bees,</b> but the duration of their flights increased and decreased over time, respectively. Overall, parasitized bees spent more time in the field each day than <b>control</b> <b>bees,</b> and the inverse was true for immune-challenged bees.

40|$|Pesticides can harm {{honey bee}} health and {{foraging}} behavior, even when bees {{are exposed to}} sublethal doses. We tested the effect of imidacloprid, a common neonicotinoid pesticide, on honey bee avoidance of danger during foraging in indoor and outdoor feeder choice trials. Danger stimuli consisted of honey bee sting gland alarm pheromone or live praying mantises. In outdoor foraging experiments in which bees chose between two feeders, bees fed repeatedly upon sucrose solution containing a high but field-realistic concentration of 40 μg/L imidacloprid. However, there was no effect of pesticide treatment. Neither pesticide nor <b>control</b> <b>bees</b> demonstrated significant avoidance of the live mantis (P≥ 0. 63 for non pesticide bees and P≥ 0. 42 for pesticide <b>bees).</b> In contrast, <b>control</b> <b>bees</b> avoided the alarm pheromone feeder in all three consecutive choices (P≤ 0. 01). Pesticide-treated bees avoided the alarm pheromone feeder only on their second choice (P= 0. 004). There was no significant overall effect of pesticide treatment in this experiment. In indoor trials designed to mimic outdoor foraging under <b>controlled</b> conditions, <b>bees</b> exposed to 1 ng or 2. 16 ng of imidacloprid spent 16 - 26 % less time {{on the side of}} the indoor arena with alarm pheromone as compared to <b>control</b> <b>bees.</b> These trials possibly presented a different context: bees attempting to escape rather than forage. Overall, our results do not provide strong support for the hypothesis that imidacloprid alters bee decision-making about danger in the context of foraging, though the indoor trials suggest a new avenue of investigation into the effects of imidacloprid on honey bee escape behavior...|$|R

Nosema free honeybees were inoculated with 125, 000 N. ceranae spores, isolated from heavily infected bees. The parasite spe-cies was identified by amplification and sequencing the SSUrRNA gene of the administered spores. Three replicate cages of 20 honeybees each were prepared, {{along with one}} control cage (n = 20) supplied with sugar syrup only. The infection rate was 100 % at the dosage administered. The presence of Nosema inside ventricular cells was confirmed in the samples using ultrathin sectioning and transmission electron microscopy. By day 3 p. i. a few cells (4. 4 % ± 1. 2) were observed to be parasitized, whereas by 6 days p. i. {{more than half of}} the counted cells (66. 4 % ± 6) showed different parasite stages, this value increasing on day 7 p. i.

However, the techniques used to explore psychological phenomena in honey bees have been limited to only a few primary methodologies such as the proboscis extension reflex, sting extension reflex, and free flying target discrimination-tasks. Methods to explore operant conditioning in bees and other invertebrates are not as varied as with vertebrates. This {{may be due to the}} availability of a suitable response requirement. In this manuscript we offer a new method to explore operant conditioning in honey bees: the cap pushing response (CPR). We used the CPR to test for difference in learning curves between novel auto-shaping and more traditional explicit-shaping. The CPR protocol requires bees to exhibit a novel behavior by pushing a cap to uncover a food source. Using the CPR protocol we tested the effects of both explicit-shaping and auto-shaping techniques on operant conditioning. The goodness of fit and lack of fit of these data to the Rescorla-Wagner learning-curve model, widely used in classical conditioning studies, was tested. The model fit well to both control and explicit-shaping results, but only for a limited number of trials. Learning ceased rather than continuing to asymptotically approach the physiological most accurate possible. Rate of learning differed between shaped and <b>control</b> <b>bee</b> treatments. Learning rate was about 3 times faster for shaped bees, but for all measures of proficiency control and shaped bees reached the same level. Auto-shaped bees showed one-trial learning rather than the asymptotic approach to a maximal efficiency.

Recent studies however have suggested that exposure to systemic neonicotinoid insecticides in flowering crops has sub-lethal effects on the bumblebee workforce, and hence in reducing queen production. The mechanism behind reduced nest performance, however, remains unclear. Here we use Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to test whether exposure to a low, field realistic dose (0. 7 ppb in sugar water and 6 ppb in pollen) of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, reduces worker foraging efficiency. Whilst the nectar foraging efficiency of bees treated with imidacloprid was not significantly different than that of <b>control</b> <b>bees,</b> treated bees brought back pollen less often than <b>control</b> <b>bees</b> (40 % of trips vs 63 % trips, respectively) and, where pollen was collected, treated bees brought back 31 % less pollen per hour than controls.

However, honeybees can be exposed to insect growth regulators (IGRs), such as JH analogs developed for insect pest and vector control. Although their side effects as endocrine disruptors on honeybee larval or adult stages have been studied, little is known about the subsequent effects on adults of a sublethal larval exposure. We therefore studied the impact of the JH analog pyriproxyfen on larvae and resulting adults within a colony under semi-field conditions by combining recent laboratory larval tests with chemical analysis and behavioral observations. Oral and chronic larval exposure at cumulative doses of 23 or 57 ng per larva were tested. Pyriproxyfen-treated bees emerged earlier than <b>control</b> <b>bees</b> and the highest dose led to a significant rate of malformed adults (atrophied wings). Young pyriproxyfen-treated bees were more frequently rejected by nestmates from the colony, inducing a shorter life span.

Microsporidia like Nosema ceranae are {{a serious threat to}} colony health; we demonstrated that immune priming (IP) of newly emerged A. mellifera workers using autoclaved N. ceranae spores can activate an immune response, resulting in lower infection levels after subsequent challenge with live N. ceranae spores. Upon death, bees that were immune primed and challenged were observed to have significantly lower (34 %) infection levels compared to <b>control</b> <b>bees</b> that were not immune primed.

Apis cerana is a native bee that is an important pollinator of agricultural crops and native plants in Asia. When foraging on nectar containing 40 µg/L (34 ppb) imidacloprid, honey bees (Apis cerana) showed no aversion to a feeder with a hornet predator, and 1. 8 fold more bees chose the dangerous feeder as compared to <b>control</b> <b>bees.</b> <b>Control</b> <b>bees</b> exhibited significant predator avoidance.

For that purpose, we investigated the influence of pollen nutrients on the transcriptome of worker bees parasitized by the mite Varroa destructor, known for suppressing immunity and decreasing lifespan. The 4 experimental groups (<b>control</b> <b>bees</b> without a pollen diet, <b>control</b> <b>bees</b> fed with pollen, varroa-parasitized bees without a pollen diet and varroa-parasitized bees fed with pollen) were analyzed by performing a digital gene expression (DGE) analysis on bee abdomens. Results Around 36, 000 unique tags were generated per DGE-tag library, which matched about 8, 000 genes (60 % of the genes in the honey bee genome). Comparing the transcriptome of bees fed with pollen and sugar and bees restricted to a sugar diet, we found that pollen activates nutrient-sensing and metabolic pathways. In addition, those nutrients had a positive influence on genes affecting longevity and the production of some antimicrobial peptides. However, varroa parasitism caused the development of viral populations and a decrease in metabolism, specifically by inhibiting protein metabolism essential to bee health. This harmful effect was not reversed by pollen intake. Conclusions The DGE-tag profiling methods used in this study proved to be a powerful means for analyzing transcriptome variation related to nutrient intake in honey bees. Ultimately, with such an approach, applying genomics tools to nutrition research, nutrigenomics promises to offer {{a better understanding of how}} nutrition influences body homeostasis and may help reduce the susceptibility of bees to (less virulent) pathogens. </p...|$|R

However, this distance is inadequate to prevent cross-foraging of <b>control</b> <b>bees</b> in treated fields or vice versa, as honeybees have known limit of foraging ranges between 6 and 10  km [7]. Furthermore, according to the authors, each site was “isolated” from other bee-attractive crops and other maize and rapeseed fields, but no evidence is provided how such “isolation” was practically achieved in the field, {{and this would be}} very difficult to do in most arable farmland areas. Conversely, if the experimental plots were planted in areas unsuitable for arable farming, then one might expect that flowering of the crop would be poor. We would normally expect the locations of studies to be provided, for example by aerial photography or GPS coordinates.|$|R

When exposed to sub-lethal doses of thiamethoxam, at levels present in the environment, honey bees were less likely to return to the hive after foraging than <b>control</b> <b>bees</b> that were tracked with Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tagging technology, but not intentionally dosed with pesticides. Higher risks are observed when the homing task is more challenging. The survival rate is even lower when exposed bees are placed in foraging areas with which they are less familiar.|$|R

40|$|Nosema ceranae is an {{important}} honey bee pathogen that has been implicated in CCD. Until recently, it {{was thought to be}} exclusively a disease of adult bees, but recent findings indicate that it can also infect larvae. Thus, {{little is known about the}} effects of larval Nosema infection. Vitellogenin (Vg) is a key protein necessary for egg-laying, production of brood food, proper immune function, and promotion of longevity through the reduction of oxidative stress. In worker bees, Vg increases in bees of nursing age, at approximately 7 days of age. We therefore investigated the effects of larval Nosema infection on hemolymph Vg and total protein concentration. Larvae infected by a high dose of Nosema ceranae spores developed into adults with 2 fold higher Vg titers. However, they also had 1. 3 fold lower total hemolymph protein titers. Thus, Nosema infection resulted in a corresponding 1. 7 fold increase in percentage Vg compared to <b>control.</b> Infected <b>bees</b> also had 1. 1 fold fewer barbs than did <b>control</b> <b>bees</b> and, we found an inverse relationship between Vg and the number of barbs per lancet. Overall, adult infected bees were not significantly different from controls. Our results indicate that larval N. ceranae infection has a greater impact than does adult infection on adult honey bees. Overall, Nosema ceranae accelerates aging and causes infected bees to resemble older workers or queen...|$|R
