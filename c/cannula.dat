5|$|The {{indwelling}} cannula: Outside of the United States, many piercers use {{a needle}} containing a <b>cannula</b> (or catheter), a hollow plastic tube {{placed at the}} end of the needle. In some countries, the piercing needle favoured in the United States is regarded as a medical device and is illegal for body piercers. The procedure is similar to the piercing needle method, but the initial jewellery is inserted into the back of the <b>cannula</b> and the <b>cannula</b> and the jewellery are then pulled through the piercing. More bleeding may follow, as the piercing is larger than the jewellery.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it offers}} the {{greatest}} degree of protection against regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration, tracheal intubation {{is not the only}} means to maintain a patent airway. Alternative techniques for airway management and delivery of oxygen, volatile anesthetics or other breathing gases include the laryngeal mask airway, i-gel, cuffed oropharyngeal airway, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP mask), nasal BiPAP mask, simple face mask, and nasal <b>cannula.</b>|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY. In an {{investigation}} of bacterial colonisation of intravascular <b>cannulae,</b> 16 peripheral venous <b>cannulae</b> of the Venflon variety and 24 chronic haemodialysis <b>cannulae</b> were studied after removal from patients. Studies of colonisation included semi-quantitative microbiolo-gical culture and scanning electronmicrographic (SEM) observations. The microbiological findings indicated colonisation of the intravascular portion of the catheter in 4 of 16 Venflon <b>cannulae</b> and 18 of 26 haemodialysis <b>cannulae,</b> largely with skin commensal organisms. The results of the SEM studies were in broad agreement with the microbiolo-gical observations. Surface defects on the <b>cannulae</b> were shown {{to be associated with}} microbial colonisation which occurred either as isolated colonies or in association with a cellular fibrinous matrix. These observations are illustrated and discussed...|$|R
5|$|The gold {{standard}} test for biliary obstruction is still {{endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography}} (ERCP). This {{involves the use of}} endoscopy (passing a tube through the mouth into the esophagus, stomach and thence to the duodenum) to pass a small <b>cannula</b> into the bile duct. At that point, radiocontrast is injected to opacify the duct, and X-rays are taken to get a visual impression of the biliary system. On the endoscopic image of the ampulla, one can sometimes see a protuberant ampulla from an impacted gallstone in the common bile duct or the frank extrusion of pus from the common bile duct orifice. On the X-ray images (known as cholangiograms), gallstones are visible as non-opacified areas in the contour of the duct. For diagnostic purposes, ERCP has now generally been replaced by MRCP. ERCP is only used first-line in critically ill patients in whom delay for diagnostic tests is not acceptable; however, if the index of suspicion for cholangitis is high, an ERCP is typically done to achieve drainage of the obstructed common bile duct.|$|E

25|$|A {{peripheral}} <b>cannula</b> is {{the most}} common intravenous access method utilized in both hospitals and pre-hospital services. A peripheral IV line (PVC or PIV) consists of a short catheter (a few centimeters long) inserted through the skin into a peripheral vein (any vein not situated in the chest or abdomen). This is usually {{in the form of a}} cannula-over-needle device, in which a flexible plastic <b>cannula</b> comes mounted over a metal trocar. Once the tip of the needle and <b>cannula</b> are introduced into the vein via venipuncture, the <b>cannula</b> is advanced inside the vein over the trocar to the appropriate position and secured, the trocar is then withdrawn and discarded. Blood samples may be drawn directly after the initial IV <b>cannula</b> insertion.|$|E

Methods: Three-port pars plana incisions were generated in six rubber eyes using 23 -, 25 -, and 27 -gauge valved and non-valved trocar <b>cannulas.</b> The models were filled with air and IOP was measured. Similar procedures were followed for 36 acrylic eyes filled with saline solution. Vitreous incarceration was analyzed in eleven rabbit and twelve porcine cadaver eyes. Results: In the air-filled model, IOP loss was 89 %– 94 % when two non-valved <b>cannulas</b> were unoccupied versus 1 %– 5 % when two valved <b>cannulas</b> were unoccupied. In the fluid-filled model, with non-valved <b>cannulas,</b> IOP dropped while fluid leaked from the open ports. With two open ports, the IOP dropped to 20 %– 30 % of set infusion pressure, regardless of infusion pressure and IOP compensation. The IOP was maintained in valved <b>cannulas</b> when one or two ports were left open, regardless of IOP compensation settings. There was no or minimal fluid leakage through open ports at any infusion pressure. Direct microscopic analysis of rabbit eyes showed that vitreous incarceration was significantly greater with 23 -gauge non-valved than valved <b>cannulas</b> (P< 0. 005), and endoscopy of porcine eyes showed that vitreous incarceration was significantly greater with 23 -gauge (P< 0. 05) and 27 -gauge (P< 0. 05) non-valved <b>cannulas.</b> External observation of rabbit eyes showed vitreous prolapse through non-valved, but not valved, <b>cannulas.</b> Conclusion: Valved <b>cannulas</b> surpassed non-valved <b>cannulas</b> in maintaining IOP, preventing fluid leakage, and reducing vitreous incarceration during simulated vitrectomy.

25|$|The surgeon effects a stab {{incision}} {{just above}} the lateral aspect of the inframammary fold (IMF), piercing the skin 2-cm above the inframammary fold, in the midline. The pre-tunnelling is performed with the blunt-tip, multi-perforation <b>cannula</b> used to infiltrate the anaesthetic solution to the breast tissues. A blunt-tip, 4-mm <b>cannula,</b> connected either to a medical-grade vacuum pump or to a syringe, is used to aspirate (suck) the adipose fat. The <b>cannula</b> is maneuvered laterally (in fanning movements), beginning in the deep plane of the breast and concluding in the superficial plane of the breast; the adipose fat sucked from the breast is a yellow, fatty, bloodless fluid; the liposuction concludes upon drawing the required volume of fat, or when the fat becomes bloody.|$|E
25|$|Liposuction, {{also known}} as lipoplasty, is a {{cosmetic}} surgical procedure that slims and reshapes specific areas of the body by removing excess fat deposits, improving the body's contours and proportion, and ultimately, enhancing the patient's self-image. Liposuction {{involves the use of}} a small stainless steel tube, called a <b>cannula.</b> The <b>cannula</b> is connected to a powerful suction pump and inserted into the fat through small incisions in the skin. Fat removal is accomplished as the suction <b>cannula</b> creates tiny tunnels through the fatty layers. Liposuction can be performed on both men and women. Ideal for this type of procedure are non-smokers, healthy individuals who do not have a life-threatening illness or medical conditions that can impair healing, adults within 30% of their ideal weight who have firm and elastic skin.|$|E

25|$|After {{a median}} sternotomy, a {{surgical}} retractor is placed by the surgeon to optimize {{exposure of the}} heart. At this time, heparin is given to thin the blood to prevent thrombus from forming while on CPB. The surgeon places a <b>cannula</b> in the right atrium, vena cava, or femoral vein to withdraw blood from the venous circulation. The perfusionist uses gravity to drain the venous blood into the CPB machine, and a separate <b>cannula,</b> usually placed in the aorta or femoral artery, is used to return blood to the arterial circulation.|$|E

25|$|The 20th century saw {{improvements}} in abortion technology, increasing its safety, and reducing its side-effects.

30|$|Extracorporeal {{membrane}} oxygenation (ECMO) is {{a highly}} specialised form of advanced life support that can be utilised in critically ill patients who require short-term respiratory and/or cardiac support [1 – 3]. Whilst there are numerous access and cannulation options available for ECMO, they can be classified into two groups: central access and peripheral access [4, 5]. Transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiography play {{a fundamental role in}} the management of patients supported with mechanical support devices, including ECMO [6 – 10]. Malpositioning of access and return <b>cannulae</b> or inflow/outflow <b>cannulae</b> of any form of mechanical support can have significant adverse consequences. It may cause ineffective delivery of haemodynamic support, haemolysis, increase the risk of ‘suckdown’, acute pulmonary oedema or cardiac trauma. Imaging guidance is important during <b>cannulae</b> insertion and optimal positioning of mechanical cardiac support devices [11, 12] and especially for peripheral <b>cannulae</b> for VV ECMO. Correct access and return <b>cannulae</b> placement in this form of support is required to prevent recirculation and optimise oxygenation.|$|R
25|$|In {{the study}} Fat Grafting to the Breast Revisited: Safety and Efficacy (2007), the {{investigators}} {{reported that the}} autologous fat was harvested by liposuction, using a 10-ml syringe attached to a two-hole Coleman harvesting cannula; after centrifugation, the refined breast-filler fat was transferred to 3-ml syringes. Blunt infiltration cannulas were used to emplace the fat through 2-mm incisions; the blunt <b>cannula</b> injection method allowed greater dispersion of small aliquots (equal measures) of fat, and reduced the possibility of intravascular fat injection; no sharp needles are used for fat-graft injection to the breasts. The 2-mm incisions were positioned to allow the infiltration (emplacement) of fat grafts from at least two directions; a 0.2ml fat volume was emplaced with each withdrawal of the <b>cannula.</b>|$|E
25|$|Anaesthestic {{preparation}} — To limit bleeding {{during the}} liposuction, the proper degree of vasoconstriction of the breast's circulatory system is established with an anaesthetic solution (lidocaine + epinephrine in saline solution) that is infiltrated {{to the deep}} and the superficial plains of each breast. Using a blunt-tip, multi-perforation <b>cannula,</b> the anaesthetic infiltration begins at the deep plane of the breast, and continues as the <b>cannula</b> is withdrawn towards the superficial plane of the breast. The entire area of the breast is infiltrated with the anaesthetic solution until the tissues become tumescent (firm).

25|$|Around {{the same}} time that menstrual {{extraction}} was first used in the United States, a method utilizing nearly identical technology was beginning to be used internationally. This method, another type of Manual Vacuum Aspiration, is most often called Menstrual Regulation. As with ME, menstrual regulation, when desired as a method of controlling fertility, is performed very early in the menstrual cycle, earlier than a pregnancy test can be performed. One main difference between these two methods is the equipment used. While the Del Em was created such that one is able to put it together from individual pieces and it consists of three parts: the <b>cannula</b> with a one-way valve, a collection jar and the syringe, which are connected by plastic tubing; Menstrual Regulation is performed with a commercially produced kit which consists of two parts, the <b>cannula</b> with a one-way valve and a directly connected syringe.

Breath to breath values of FIO 2 were calculated by extrapolation from expired oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations {{on the basis of the}} oxygen-carbon dioxide relationship and on the assumption of a respiratory exchange ratio (R) of 0. 8. RESULTS: In both groups of subjects the average values of FIO 2 with nasal <b>cannulas</b> at 1 and 2 l min- 1 were of a similar order to those achieved with 24. 5 % and 28 % Venturi masks, but variations within and between subjects in both groups breathing via nasal <b>cannulas</b> were considerable and similar to those found with MC masks. In the seven patients with chronic obstructive lung disease breathing via nasal <b>cannulas</b> at 2 l min- 1 the average FIO 2 varied from 23. 7 % to 34. 9 %.
