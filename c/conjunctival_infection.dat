This study assessed the clinical efficacy of besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0. 6 % against conjunctivitis infections caused by potentially consequential pathogens. Design: Post hoc analysis of clinical outcomes for patients with <b>conjunctival</b> <b>infections</b> due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Neisseria spp., methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) who were treated with besifloxacin in four multicenter, double-masked, randomized clinical trials. Methods: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of besifloxacin against potentially consequential pathogens were pooled. Clinical outcome data for patients treated with besifloxacin with baseline infections due to these pathogens were pooled and summarized. Bacterial eradication was defined as the absence of ocular bacterial species present at or above threshold at baseline. Results: A total of 1, 317 patients had culture-confirmed bacterial conjunctivitis across the four studies, and 151 infections were due to the aforementioned pathogens (P. aeruginosa n= 9; S. marcescens n= 10; Neisseria spp. n= 16; MRSA n= 35; MRSE n= 81). Among MRSA and MRSE infections, 48. 3 % demonstrated concurrent ciprofloxacin resistance (ciprofloxacin-resistant [CipR]-MRSA n= 24; CipR-MRSE n= 32). The MIC 90 (MIC for 90 % of isolates) for besifloxacin was 1 µg/mL for S. marcescens, 0. 25 µg/mL for Neisseria spp., 0. 06 µg/mL for both ciprofloxacin-sensitive MRSA and ciprofloxacin-sensitive MRSE, and 4 µg/mL for both CipR-MRSA and CipR-MRSE. Against P. aeruginosa, the MIC range was 1 – 4 µg/mL. Bacterial eradication rates in patients treated with besifloxacin were 100 % by the first follow-up visit for infections due to P. aeruginosa, S. marcescens, and Neisseria spp. and 87. 8 % by the second follow-up visit for infections due to MRSA and MRSE.

The disparity in the percentage contribution of three infection patterns was significant (P[*]<[*] 0.05). Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed chloramphenicol and ofloxacin as the least and most active antibiotics tested as 99 (63.9 %) and 149 (96.1 %) of the 155 recovered isolates were sensitive to them. On the whole, the least susceptible pathogen was P. aeruginosa with sensitivities ranging from 20 % to 80 %, while Moraxella sp. represented the most sensitive pathogen with sensitivities ranging from 71.4 % to 100 %.

The disease caused by the fungus Rhino-sporidium seeberi was seen most frequently in young children between eight and 10 years of age. Males were infected more than females (2. 5 : 1). The conjunctiva was the most common site of infection in 76 (92. 68 %) of the cases. The lacrimal sac was affected only in six (7. 32 %) cases. Simple total excision of the conjunctival polyps gave highly satisfactory results in cases of <b>conjunctival</b> sac <b>infections.</b> Except for one patient, there were no recurrences in the 76 cases.

Subsequent investigations have indicated its pleomor-phic character, first with the recognition of a venereal form (6, 8, IO), later a <b>conjunctival</b> type of <b>infection</b> (I, 9) and most recently the observations of a phase of the infection characterized by encephalitis (2, 4, 5). Serological studies and field observations have indicated that infection by this virus often does not result in any recognizable disease. This virus, both field and vaccine strains, has also been suspected of causing abortion in cattle. This suspicion has recently been con-firmed by several laboratories (I I, 12). The purpose of this report is to describe the effects of infection by this virus in the bovine fetus and to record the pattern of abortion in one herd following vaccination with a modified IBR virus...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} was {{performed}} to describe 2 cases of human thelaziasis (HT) which occurred in Gyeongsangnam-do and to briefly review the previously reported Korean cases. A 58 -year old woman, residing in Hadong-gun, Gyeongsangnam-do, came to Gyeongsang National University Hospital (GNUH) complaining of foreign body sensation and itching of the right eye in March 2000. Total 6 adult nematodes of Thelazia callipaeda (2 males and 4 females) were detected in her right eye. A 80 -year old man, residing in Jinju-si, Gyeongsangnam-do, came to GNUH complaining of foreign body sensation, itching, and pain of the right eye in December 2007. A total of 5 worms (4 females and 1 degenerated) were removed from his right eye. We analyzed characteristics of the total 39 Korean HT cases reported to date, including the present 2 cases. Most of the cases (71. 8 %) occurred in Seoul and Gyeonggi-do before 2000, and 21 cases (53. 8 %) were males and 18 (46. 2 %) were females. The prevalence was higher in younger ages below 30 years (48. 7 %) than 31 - 60 years (41. 0 %) and over 61 years (10. 3 %). The seasonal prevalence showed a higher incidence in autumn (43. 6 %) than in other seasons. Most of the cases (94. 9 %) were <b>conjunctival</b> sac <b>infections</b> and only 2 (5. 1 %) were intraocular cases. The present 2 HT cases are the first reported cases in Gyeongsangnam-do. Some characteristics of Korean HT cases were analyzed. Key words: Thelazia callipaeda, thelaziasis, case report, revie...|$|R
