In general, community property {{may result in}} lower federal capital gain taxes {{after the death of}} one spouse when the surviving spouse then sells the property. Some states have created a newer form of community property, called [...] "community property with right of survivorship." [...] This form of holding title has some similarities to joint tenancy with right of survivorship. The rules and effect of holding title as community property (or another form of <b>concurrent</b> <b>ownership)</b> vary from state to state.|$|E
40|$|Most of {{the rules}} covered in {{standard}} real property casebooks are summarized in this concise work. For quick reference the text {{is divided into three}} sections. Part One overviews interests in land, such as adverse possession, common-law estates, and <b>concurrent</b> <b>ownership.</b> Part Two covers conveyances through real estate brokers, contract of sale, transfer of title by deed, and mortgages. Part Three concludes with a discussion on miscellaneous property doctrines. [URL]...|$|E

The company was headed by Michael Baker, who also served as station general manager, sales manager, and chief engineer. <b>Concurrent</b> with the <b>ownership</b> change, {{approved}} the following March, was a call letter change for both stations to its current incarnation. The format offerings for both stations remained relatively unchanged.|$|R

Studies of Human-Animal Interaction (HAI) have proposed that there are health benefits and risks associated with pet ownership. However, accurately demonstrating and understanding these relationships first requires a better knowledge of factors associated with ownership of different pet types. A UK birth cohort, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), were used to collect pet ownership data from the mothers, from gestation to child age 10 years old. 14, 663 children {{were included in the}} study, of which mothers of 13, 557 reported pet information at gestation, and 7, 800 by age 10. Pet types recorded include cat, dog, rabbit, rodent, bird, fish and tortoise/turtle. The dataset also contains a number of demographic, socioeconomic and behavioural variables relevant to human health behaviour. Logistic regression was used to build multivariable models for ownership of each pet type at age 7 years. Family pet ownership increased during childhood, in particular rabbits, rodents and fish. A number of socioeconomic and demographic factors were associated with ownership of different pet types and the effects differed depending on the pet type studied. Variables which require consideration by researchers include gender, presence of older siblings, ethnicity, maternal and paternal education, maternal and paternal social class, maternal age, {{number of people in the}} household, house type, and <b>concurrent</b> <b>ownership</b> of other pets. Whether the mother had pets during her childhood was a strong predictor of pet ownership in all models. In HAI studies, care should be taken to control for confounding factors, and to treat each pet type individually. ALSPAC and other similar birth cohorts can be considered a potential resource for research into the effects of pet ownership during childhood...|$|E
40|$|Most Americans in {{the mid-nineteenth}} century lived within a society of laws. There are at least two opposed views with respect to what American attitudes and actions were like outside of such a lawful society. On the one hand, some historians have speculated that {{frontier}} life was lawless and violent. Might entailed right, according to this view. On the other hand, others have suggested that frontier life was natural and good. Americans, freed of the restraints of law, intuitively acted justly. John Phillip Reid here examines countless diaries and letters of American emigrants on the Overland Trail at mid-century. In particular, he examines their attitudes about property and how these attitudes influenced their behavior. He concludes that emigrants on the Overland Trail were neither peculiarly violent nor unusually just. Instead, they were universally lawful. They understood complex concepts of property, and these concepts influenced their behavior. Reid suggests that their understanding of legal ownership and its prerogatives (sometimes exaggerated) was the most important element in influencing their actions with respect to personal property on the trail. Property law, as understood on the trail, was not simplistic. Persons understood the concept of ownership as distinct from mere possession. There was no doubt, for example, that an owner who had lost his property had a legal right to reclaim it. There was no rule of finders-keepers. At most, Reid concludes, a finder could assert a claim for a finder 2 ̆ 7 s fee. The abstract rights of ownership were so potent on the trail that an owner could even reclaim his property from a possessor who had purchased the property in good faith. Although Reid does not address the issue, this might have been an exaggeration of the owner 2 ̆ 7 s prerogatives. In several eastern states, the law at that time was beginning to protect some good faith purchasers. Not only did trail emigrants have no trouble understanding abstract concepts of ownership, they were also conversant with several forms of <b>concurrent</b> <b>ownership.</b> Much property was owned in partnership. This frequently caused divisiveness when equal owners wanted to do different things with the property (e. g., go back home, speed up the journey, abandon the property). Although {{there were a number of}} solutions to these problems, all began with the unalterable premise that each owner had a legal claim to some portion of the property. Co-ownership also caused problems when a particular resource grew scarce. The emigrants normally solved these problems by converting the jointly owned property to privately owned property. Thus, if sugar became scarce, and some owners were using more than their fair share, the emigrants would normally designate each person a private owner of a portion of the sugar. Each could then use his or her sugar at any rate he or she chose. Some may perceive such a solution as an exaggerated reliance on private property concepts...|$|E
