To control the rating system requirement from a legislative perspective, article 9 {{of the new}} Motion Picture Act (t=電影法-中華民國104年), promulgated by the Legislative Yuan, maintains that motion pictures and their advertisements shall not be screened if not granted a rating by the <b>central</b> competent <b>authority</b> which <b>shall</b> convene a rating commission to rate films. Members of the commission shall be representatives of government agencies, and scholars and experts having academic or practical experience in related fields. The commission’s conclusions shall be made public and clear rationales for ratings given be listed. Article 10 maintains if motion pictures and their advertisements violate restrictions or prohibitions laid out in law, the <b>central</b> competent <b>authority</b> <b>shall</b> not grant a rating. The Ministry of Culture established by the Executive Yuan further specifies that not more than {{one third of the}} committee members can come from the Bureau of Audiovisual and Music Industry Development.|$|R

However, the Mexican government dedicates limited resources to the Mexican <b>Central</b> <b>Authority,</b> including insufficient staff to handle the volume of cases. The Mexican <b>Central</b> <b>Authority’s</b> ability to help bring about successful resolution of individual cases involving children taken from the U.S. is correspondingly limited. U.S. Embassy officials meet monthly with Mexican <b>Central</b> <b>Authority</b> personnel to obtain updates on pending cases but, even with regular and continued embassy involvement, the Mexican <b>Central</b> <b>Authority</b> clearly is overburdened.

2500|$|Inspired by the Hague Evidence Convention and the Hague Service Convention's of 1965 and 1970, the Abduction Convention {{required}} {{the establishment of}} a single <b>Central</b> <b>Authority</b> in each country that would handle two-way communications with domestic courts, administrative agencies and foreign <b>Central</b> <b>Authorities.</b> Furthermore, each <b>Central</b> <b>Authority</b> was required to take [...] "any and all actions" [...] to secure the goals of the treaty and cooperate with other <b>Central</b> <b>Authority's</b> to do the same.

40|$|Strong <b>central</b> <b>authorities</b> {{are able}} to {{effectively}} manage costly defection, but are unable to adequately address lesser conflicts because of limits {{to their ability to}} monitor and enforce. We argue, counterintuitively, that these limitations build coop-eration and trust among subordinates: the limitations contribute to the production of order. First, limits to authority leave space for locally informed decentralized enforce-ment. Second, <b>central</b> <b>authorities</b> act as powerful but incompetent third parties whose threatened interventions increase incentives to cooperate and, therefore, to trust. We outline the mechanisms by which a strong <b>central</b> <b>authority</b> enforces order and test their utility by considering the secondary literature on rates of conflict in strong, weak, and capricious states. We supplement this evidence, based on association, with a close examination of diverse case studies: baseball umpires, commercial contracts, and domestic disputes. By analyzing these case studies, we isolate and describe the mechanisms by which <b>central</b> <b>authorities</b> produce order in varied settings. We find that <b>central</b> <b>authority</b> may be effective, but the majority of this effectiveness derives from an indirect influence on dyadic relations rather than direct intervention.
