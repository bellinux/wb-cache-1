5|$|<b>Chimpanzees</b> {{are capable}} of {{actively}} locating objects that {{are the focus of}} another individual's attention by tracking the gaze of others. They are not limited to following eye gaze to the first interesting object in their view. They use a number of different cues to engage in shared focus, including head movement and eye gaze. Infant <b>chimpanzees</b> start to follow tap, point, and head turn cues of an experimenter by nine months of age. By 13 months of age, they show following responses to glance cues without a head turn. There is no evidence to support that infant <b>chimpanzees</b> are able to use eye gaze alone as a cue for following responses. By 20 months of age, infant <b>chimpanzees</b> are able to follow an experimenter's cues to a target behind the chimpanzee but infant <b>chimpanzees</b> do not look back to the experimenter after looking at the target. Moving targets are more salient than stationary targets for infant <b>chimpanzees.</b> Chimpanzee infants are sensitive to faces which are gazing at them, but <b>chimpanzees</b> less than three to four years old only look within their visual field when using the experimenter's head turn as their cue.|$|E
5|$|Other animals such {{as great}} apes, orangutans, <b>chimpanzees,</b> dogs, and horses also show some {{elements}} of joint attention.|$|E
5|$|Governments {{such as the}} Netherlands and New Zealand {{have responded}} to the public's {{concerns}} by outlawing invasive experiments on certain classes of non-human primates, particularly the great apes. In 2015, captive <b>chimpanzees</b> in the U.S. were added to the Endangered Species Act adding new road blocks to those wishing to experiment on them. Similarly, citing ethical considerations and the availability of alternative research methods, the U.S. NIH announced in 2013 that it would dramatically reduce and eventually phase out experiments on <b>chimpanzees.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although the {{parasite}} responsible for P.falciparum malaria {{has been in}} existence for 50,000–100,000 years, the population size of {{the parasite}} did not increase until about 10,000 years ago, concurrently with advances in agriculture {{and the development of}} human settlements. Close relatives of the human malaria parasites remain common in <b>chimpanzees.</b> Some evidence suggests that the P.falciparum malaria may have originated in gorillas.|$|E

5|$|In {{communal}} defence, prey groups actively {{defend themselves}} by grouping together, and sometimes by attacking or mobbing a predator, rather than allowing {{themselves to be}} passive victims of predation. Mobbing is the harassing of a predator by many prey animals. Mobbing is usually done to protect the young in social colonies. For example, red colobus monkeys exhibit mobbing when threatened by <b>chimpanzees,</b> a common predator. The male red colobus monkeys group together and place themselves between predators and the group's females and juveniles. The males jump together and actively bite the <b>chimpanzees.</b> Fieldfares are birds which may nest either solitarily or in colonies. Within colonies, fieldfares mob and defecate on approaching predators, shown experimentally to reduce predation levels.|$|E

50|$|Early Research on Animal Grief:In 1879, Arthur E. Brown studied how a male <b>chimpanzee</b> reacted {{after the}} death of his female counterpart. He saw the male <b>chimpanzee</b> display grief and “a cry which the keeper of the animals assures Brown he had never heard before” (Brown, 1879, p. 174). Continuing to the next day, the <b>chimpanzee</b> sulked and barely moved. Brown (1879) deciphered that the male <b>chimpanzee</b> was {{depressed}} after the female <b>chimpanzee</b> died. However, Brown (1879) concluded that any permanent grief is only found in man, as the <b>chimpanzee</b> seemed fine after a couple of days.|$|R
50|$|The western <b>chimpanzee,</b> or West African <b>chimpanzee,</b> (Pan troglodytes verus) is a {{subspecies}} of {{the common}} <b>chimpanzee.</b> It inhabits western Africa, mainly in Côte d'Ivoire and Guinea but with populations in surrounding countries.|$|R
5|$|Infant {{and parent}} <b>chimpanzees</b> show dyadic joint {{attention}} in an affectionate manner {{by looking at}} each other's eyes Non-human animals such as Japanese monkeys, baboons, and other Old World monkeys seldom engage in dyadic joint attention. For these animals, the eye contact involved in dyadic joint attention is deemed threatening.|$|E
5|$|Non-human {{primates}} (NHPs) {{are used}} in toxicology tests, studies of AIDS and hepatitis, studies of neurology, behavior and cognition, reproduction, genetics, and xenotransplantation. They {{are caught in the}} wild or purpose-bred. In the United States and China, most primates are domestically purpose-bred, whereas in Europe the majority are imported purpose-bred. The European Commission reported that in 2011, 6,012 monkeys were experimented on in European laboratories. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, there were 71,188 monkeys in U.S. laboratories in 2016. 23,465 monkeys were imported into the U.S. in 2014 including 929 who were caught in the wild. Most of the NHPs used in experiments are macaques; but marmosets, spider monkeys, and squirrel monkeys are also used, and baboons and <b>chimpanzees</b> {{are used in}} the US. As of 2015, there are approximately 730 <b>chimpanzees</b> in U.S. laboratories.|$|E

5|$|The first {{evidence}} of malaria parasites {{was found in}} mosquitoes preserved in amber from the Palaeogene period that are approximately 30 million years old. Human malaria likely originated in Africa and coevolved with its hosts, mosquitoes and non-human primates. Malaria protozoa are diversified into primate, rodent, bird, and reptile host lineages. Humans may have originally caught Plasmodium falciparum from gorillas. P. vivax, another malarial Plasmodium species among the six that infect humans, also likely originated in African gorillas and <b>chimpanzees.</b> Another malarial species recently discovered to be transmissible to humans, P. knowlesi, originated in Asian macaque monkeys. While P. malariae is highly host specific to humans, {{there is some evidence}} that low level non-symptomatic infection persists among wild <b>chimpanzees.</b>|$|E
5|$|Wade {{asserts that}} there is a clear {{continuity}} from the earlier apes of five million years ago to the anatomically modern humans who diverged from them, citing the genetic and social similarities between humans and <b>chimpanzees.</b> He attributes the divergence of the two species from a common ancestor to a change in their ecological niche; the ancestors of <b>chimpanzees</b> remained in the forests of equatorial Africa, whereas the ancestors of humans moved to open woodland and were exposed to different evolutionary pressures. Although Wade posits that much of human evolution {{can be attributed to the}} physical environment, he also believes that one of the major forces shaping evolution has been the nature of human society itself.|$|E
5|$|HIV-1 {{appears to}} have {{originated}} in southern Cameroon through the evolution of SIV(cpz), a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) that infects wild <b>chimpanzees</b> (HIV-1 descends from the SIV(cpz) endemic in the chimpanzee subspecies Pan troglodytes troglodytes). The closest relative of HIV-2 is SIV (smm), a virus of the sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys atys), an Old World monkey living in litoral West Africa (from southern Senegal to western Côte d'Ivoire). New World monkeys such as the owl monkey are resistant to HIV-1 infection, possibly because of a genomic fusion of two viral resistance genes.|$|E

25|$|Charles Nicolle {{reasoned}} {{that it was}} most likely lice that were the vector for epidemic typhus. He tested his theory by infecting a <b>chimpanzee</b> with typhus, retrieving the lice from it, and placing it on a healthy <b>chimpanzee.</b> Within 10 days the second <b>chimpanzee</b> had typhus as well.|$|R
5|$|More recently, {{evidence}} for common descent {{has come from}} the study of biochemical similarities between organisms. For example, all living cells use the same basic set of nucleotides and amino acids. The development of molecular genetics has revealed the record of evolution left in organisms' genomes: dating when species diverged through the molecular clock produced by mutations. For example, these DNA sequence comparisons have revealed that humans and <b>chimpanzees</b> share 98% of their genomes and analysing the few areas where they differ helps shed light on when the common ancestor of these species existed.|$|E
5|$|The Sumatran {{orangutan}} genome was sequenced in January 2011. Following {{humans and}} <b>chimpanzees,</b> the Sumatran orangutan became the third species of hominid {{to have its}} genome sequenced. Subsequently, the Bornean species had its genome sequenced. Genetic diversity {{was found to be}} lower in Bornean orangutans (P.pygmaeus) than in Sumatran ones (P.abelii), despite the fact that Borneo is home to six or seven times as many orangutans as Sumatra.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{determinant}} of infection for any virus {{is its ability}} to enter a cell and produce additional infectious particles. The presence of CD155 is thought to define the animals and tissues that can be infected by poliovirus. CD155 is found (outside of laboratories) only on the cells of humans, higher primates, and Old World monkeys. Poliovirus is, however, strictly a human pathogen, and does not naturally infect any other species (although <b>chimpanzees</b> and Old World monkeys can be experimentally infected).|$|E
50|$|In June 1909 Nicolle tested {{his theory}} by infecting a <b>chimpanzee</b> with typhus, {{retrieving}} the lice from it, and placing it on a healthy <b>chimpanzee.</b> Within 10 days the second <b>chimpanzee</b> had typhus as well.

5|$|Their feet {{have four}} long toes and an opposable big toe. Orangutans can grasp things with both {{their hands and}} their feet. Their fingers and toes are curved, {{allowing}} them {{to get a better}} grip on branches. Since their hip joints have the same flexibility as their shoulder and arm joints, orangutans have less restriction in the movements of their legs than humans have. Unlike gorillas and <b>chimpanzees,</b> orangutans are not true knuckle-walkers, and are instead fist-walkers.|$|E
5|$|Variation {{comes from}} {{mutations}} in the genome, reshuffling of genes through sexual reproduction and migration between populations (gene flow). Despite the constant {{introduction of new}} variation through mutation and gene flow, most of the genome of a species is identical in all individuals of that species. However, even relatively small differences in genotype can lead to dramatic differences in phenotype: for example, <b>chimpanzees</b> and humans differ in only about 5% of their genomes.|$|E
5|$|Young orangutans also beg {{for food}} by such contact and {{accordingly}} their caretakers regurgitate to feed them. Indeed, behaviours of mouth to mouth feeding of premasticated food and ritualized mouth to mouth contact for bonding {{has been observed}} in anthropoid great apes such as gorillas, orangutans, and <b>chimpanzees.</b> All of this supports the idea that human behaviours of kissing and feeding of premastication foods, {{either directly or indirectly}} from the mouth, have their behavioural roots in higher animals and ancestral great apes.|$|E
