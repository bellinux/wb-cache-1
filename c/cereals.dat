5|$|A {{number of}} insect pests infest stored dry {{foods such as}} flour, <b>cereals</b> and pasta; these include the Indian mealmoth, the {{cigarette}} beetle, the drugstore beetle, the confused flour beetle, the red flour beetle, the merchant grain beetle, the sawtoothed grain beetle, the wheat weevil, the maize weevil and the rice weevil.|$|E
5|$|Extensively reared animals may subsist {{entirely on}} forage, but more intensively kept {{livestock}} will require energy and protein-rich foods in addition. Energy is mainly derived from <b>cereals</b> and cereal by-products, {{fats and oils}} and sugar-rich foods, while protein may come from fish or meat meal, milk products, legumes and other plant foods, often the by-products of vegetable oil extraction. Pigs and poultry are non-ruminants and unable to digest the cellulose in grass and other forages, so they are fed entirely on <b>cereals</b> and other high-energy foodstuffs. The ingredients for the animals' rations can be grown on the farm or can be bought, {{in the form of}} pelleted or cubed, compound foodstuffs specially formulated for the different classes of livestock, their growth stages and their specific nutritional requirements. Vitamins and minerals are added to balance the diet. Farmed fish are usually fed pelleted food.|$|E
5000|$|Nesquik <b>Cereal</b> {{was first}} {{introduced}} in the US in 1999. [...] The <b>cereal</b> consists of small, 1 centimetre spheres of chocolate <b>cereal.</b> Nesquik <b>Cereal</b> is most similar to General Mills' Cocoa Puffs; it is also their most direct competitor. Nesquik <b>Cereal</b> is made with whole-grains and is thus a whole-grain <b>cereal.</b>|$|R
50|$|Lion <b>Cereal</b> {{is based}} on the Lion Bar, which {{comprises}} a filled wafer, caramel, and crisp <b>cereal,</b> covered in milk chocolate. The <b>cereal</b> consists of whole-grain <b>cereal,</b> with a caramel paste, and the same whole-grain <b>cereal</b> with cocoa. Lion <b>Cereal</b> is fortified with many vitamins, such as Vitamin B12, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B2, Vitamin B1, and niacin. This does not have any crisp <b>cereal,</b> as Lion Bars do, but instead has a flake-shaped whole-grain <b>cereal</b> in both plain and chocolate forms.|$|R
5000|$|Mr. T <b>Cereal</b> was a {{sweetened}} breakfast <b>cereal</b> {{manufactured by}} the Quaker Oats Company. The <b>cereal</b> was prepared with corn and oats as primary ingredients, and was fortified with iron and B vitamins. The <b>cereal</b> box had a cartoon likeness of Mr. T {{on the box}} as the <b>cereal's</b> mascot. The <b>cereal</b> was manufactured {{in the shape of}} the letter [...] "T". It has been described as being similar in flavor to Cap'n Crunch <b>cereal.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1945, Isdud had a {{population}} of 4,620 Arabs and 290 Jews, {{with a total of}} 47,871 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 3,277 dunams were used citrus and bananas, 8,327 for plantations and irrigable land, 23,762 for <b>cereals,</b> while 131 dunams were built-up land.|$|E
5|$|In the UK, {{the use of}} cyclodienes as seed {{dressings}} for autumn-sown <b>cereals</b> {{was banned}} in 1975 and the levels of the chemicals present in the bird population began to fall. The population has largely recovered to pre-decline levels, with an increase seen in many areas, for example northern Europe. In Sweden, the population also decreased drastically from the 1950s, but recovered again once organochlorines were banned in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Iron is pervasive, but {{particularly}} rich sources of dietary iron include red meat, lentils, beans, poultry, fish, leaf vegetables, watercress, tofu, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and blackstrap molasses. Bread and breakfast <b>cereals</b> are sometimes specifically fortified with iron. Iron in low amounts {{is found in}} molasses, teff, and farina.|$|E
50|$|Mr. T <b>Cereal</b> {{debuted in}} 1984 {{and was a}} popular <b>cereal</b> in the U.S. during the 1980s. The <b>cereal</b> was the first {{licensed}} ready-to-eat <b>cereal</b> manufactured and marketed by the Quaker Oats Company.|$|R

50|$|Originally, Lion <b>Cereal</b> was {{launched}} in the early 2000s. The early 2000s Lion <b>Cereal</b> had slightly different ingredients than the current Lion <b>Cereal.</b> The original Lion <b>Cereal</b> was sold for several years until being discontinued in 2003. It was discontinued for unknown and unclear reasons. 8 years later, the current Lion <b>Cereal</b> {{was launched}} in 2011. The new Lion <b>Cereal</b> has sold well so far, {{and has been a}} commercial success.|$|R
5|$|Modern animal {{husbandry}} relies on production systems {{adapted to the}} type of land available. Subsistence farming is being superseded by intensive animal farming in the more developed parts of the world, where for example beef cattle are kept in high density feedlots, and thousands of chickens may be raised in broiler houses or batteries. On poorer soil such as in uplands, animals are often kept more extensively, and may be allowed to roam widely, foraging for themselves. Most livestock are herbivores, except for the pig which is an omnivore. Ruminants like cattle and sheep are adapted to feed on grass; they can forage outdoors, or may be fed entirely or in part on rations richer in energy and protein, such as pelleted <b>cereals.</b> Pigs and poultry cannot digest the cellulose in forage, and require <b>cereals</b> and other high-energy foods.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people would}} have {{consumed}} at least 70% of their daily calories {{in the form of}} <b>cereals</b> and legumes. Puls (pottage) was considered the aboriginal food of the Romans. The basic grain pottage could be elaborated with chopped vegetables, bits of meat, cheese, or herbs to produce dishes similar to polenta or risotto.|$|E
5|$|Mould fungi are {{the source}} of the meaty (umami) flavour of the soybean {{products}} tempeh, miso and soy sauce. Tempeh has been produced in Java since the 13th century. Like tofu, it is made into protein-rich blocks, but these have a firm texture and earthy flavour, since (unlike tofu) the whole beans are retained, providing a higher content of dietary fibre and vitamins. Miso too is rich in protein, vitamins and minerals. It is fermented from a mixture of soybeans and <b>cereals,</b> forming a soft paste used to flavour soups and other Japanese dishes. Soy sauce has been used in China since the 2nd century AD, and is now widespread in Asia. Like miso, it is made by fermenting a mixture of soybeans and <b>cereals</b> with moulds such as Aspergillus oryzae.|$|E
5000|$|Nerds <b>Cereal,</b> a now-discontinued breakfast <b>cereal</b> that, {{like the}} candy, {{featured}} two separate flavors in a box. The <b>cereal</b> {{came with a}} mail-in offer for a Nerds <b>cereal</b> bowl, which also could be divided in two, like a standard Nerds box.|$|R
50|$|Nesquik <b>cereal</b> {{was sold}} in the USA since its inception. Though Nesquik ready-to-drink milks, mixes, and syrups sold very well, Nesquik <b>cereal</b> sales always lagged behind its competitor, Cocoa Puffs. Cocoa Puffs were a much more {{recognizable}} product, and many more people in America were familiar with it than Nesquik <b>Cereal.</b> <b>Cereal</b> Partners began to aggressively market Nesquik <b>Cereal,</b> and it sold much better. Though Cocoa Puffs remained the segment-leader, Nesquik <b>Cereal</b> became very popular, and sold quite well.|$|R
5000|$|Cap'n Crunch: The {{original}} Cap'n Crunch <b>cereal,</b> {{which at}} the time was referred to as The Crunchy Captain's <b>Cereal</b> (CCC), is made of sweetened, yellow, square-shaped <b>cereal</b> pieces made by combining corn and oats. The <b>cereal</b> was launched in 1963, bolstered by a successful advertising campaign created by noted animator Jay Ward introducing the <b>cereal's</b> longtime naval mascot, Cap'n Crunch.|$|R
5|$|Neolithic people {{experienced}} {{an economy that}} included hunting, gathering, fishing and animal rearing. Paddy husk impressions in some potsherds indicate Neolithic involvement in cultivating rice and <b>cereals</b> such as wheat, moong, masoor, and barley. Both cultivated and wild rice was harvested during summer and again during winter. The wild forms of rice are Oryza rifipogon and Oryza perennis, from which Oryza sativa (Asian rice) originated.|$|E
5|$|Out of {{the five}} types of living beings, a householder is {{forbidden}} to kill, or destroy, intentionally, all except the lowest (the one sensed, such as vegetables, herbs, <b>cereals,</b> etc., which are endowed with only the sense of touch). But, the ascetic is required to avoid even injuring the one-sensed form of life {{to the best of}} his ability.|$|E
5|$|Some rodent {{species are}} serious {{agricultural}} pests, eating {{large quantities of}} food stored by humans. For example, in 2003, the amount of rice lost to mice and rats in Asia {{was estimated to be}} enough to feed 200 million people. Most of the damage worldwide is caused by {{a relatively small number of}} species, chiefly rats and mice. In Indonesia and Tanzania, rodents reduce crop yields by around fifteen percent, while in some instances in South America losses have reached ninety percent. Across Africa, rodents including Mastomys and Arvicanthis damage <b>cereals,</b> groundnuts, vegetables and cacao. In Asia, rats, mice and species such as Microtus brandti, Meriones unguiculatus and Eospalax baileyi damage crops of rice, sorghum, tubers, vegetables and nuts. In Europe, as well as rats and mice, species of Apodemus, Microtus and in occasional outbreaks Arvicola terrestris cause damage to orchards, vegetables and pasture as well as <b>cereals.</b> In South America, a wider range of rodent species, such as Holochilus, Akodon, Calomys, Oligoryzomys, Phyllotis, Sigmodon and Zygodontomys, damage many crops including sugar cane, fruits, vegetables, and tubers.|$|E
5000|$|Dawn empties {{a box of}} <b>cereal</b> so {{that she}} can find the <b>cereal</b> box prize. Joyce says, [...] "You want the <b>cereal</b> prize, but you don't want the <b>cereal.</b> You are growing up." [...] This signifies that Dawn is {{increasingly}} becoming more human.|$|R
50|$|Rather than see Gretzky endorse an {{existing}} <b>cereal</b> brand, Barnett sought a proven company to create Gretzky's own <b>cereal</b> brand. Shortly thereafter General Mills launched ProStars <b>cereal</b> nationally in Canada. The <b>cereal,</b> {{with the side}} and back panels all Gretzky related, was popular for many years.|$|R
40|$|The {{nutritional}} quality of <b>cereal</b> foods {{is directly related}} to the nature of nutrient storage in <b>cereal</b> grains. Most <b>cereal</b> nutrients, such as carbohydrates and minerals, are st ructurally bound. Processing alters the structural organization of the <b>cereal</b> grain. Results obtained from many nutritional studies indicate that the structure and physical form of a <b>cereal</b> food greatly influence the availability of its nutrients. Using oats and wheat as examples, this review demonstrates how microscopy contributes to understanding the relationship between <b>cereal</b> structures and the availability of nutrients in <b>cereal</b> foods. Various forms of food microscopy play important roles in revealing structural changes of <b>cereal</b> foods that result from processing, cooking and enzymatic reactions. These changes directly affect the digestibility of starch, phytate and dietary fiber in oats and wheat. The present review also examines the effects of undigested fiber and phytate on the absorption of minerals in the mammalian gastrointestinal tract. Food Microscopy is a potential tool for studying the mineral binding property of <b>cereal</b> bran components...|$|R
5|$|Zinc oxide {{is added}} to many food products, {{including}} breakfast <b>cereals,</b> {{as a source of}} zinc, a necessary nutrient. (Zinc sulfate is also used for the same purpose.) Some prepackaged foods also include trace amounts of ZnO even if it is not intended as a nutrient.|$|E
5|$|A {{considerable}} amount of new knowledge about plant function comes from studies of the molecular genetics of model plants such as the Thale cress, Arabidopsis thaliana, a weedy species in the mustard family (Brassicaceae). The genome or hereditary information contained in the genes of this species is encoded by about 135 million base pairs of DNA, forming {{one of the smallest}} genomes among flowering plants. Arabidopsis was the first plant to have its genome sequenced, in 2000. The sequencing of some other relatively small genomes, of rice (Oryza sativa) and Brachypodium distachyon, has made them important model species for understanding the genetics, cellular and molecular biology of <b>cereals,</b> grasses and monocots generally.|$|E
5|$|After the First World War, {{many new}} food {{products}} became available to the typical household, with branded foods advertised for their convenience. Kitchen servants with time to make custards and puddings were replaced with instant foods in jars, or powders that the housewife could quickly mix. American-style dry <b>cereals</b> began to challenge the porridge and bacon and eggs of the middle classes, and the bread and margarine of the poor. While wartime shipping shortages had sharply narrowed choice, the 1920s saw many new kinds of fruit imported from around the world, along with better quality, packaging, and hygiene, aided by refrigerators and refrigerated ships.|$|E
50|$|The Rugrats {{had their}} own <b>cereal</b> made by Post called Reptar Crunch <b>Cereal.</b> The Rugrats and Reptar were {{predominantly}} featured on the front, there's a board game on the back, and a special $3 rebate for Runaway Reptar on the side. This <b>cereal</b> was released for a limited time only, sold at US supermarkets 8/1/99 to 9/15/99 only, and not all supermarkets carried the <b>cereal.</b> To memorialize the movie, Rugrats in Paris, another Rugrats-based <b>cereal</b> came out in October 2000. Simply called the Rugrats in Paris <b>Cereal,</b> it has a similar appearance to Trix; it's a sweetened, multi-grain <b>cereal</b> with small-round bits in plain, red, purple and green. Small Eiffel Towers could also be seen.|$|R
