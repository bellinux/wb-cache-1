40|$|Natural gas is the <b>cleanest</b> <b>burning</b> {{fossil fuel}} {{and has been}} {{identified}} as a strong candidate for energy resource compared to oil and coal. Natural gas hydrate is an energy resource for methane that has a carbon quantity twice more than all fossil fuels combined and is distributed evenly around the world. Several field trials on energy production from hydrate resources have been conducted, and their outcomes revealed the possibility of energy production from hydrate resources. In this paper, we review various studies on resource potential of natural gas hydrate, the current research progress in laboratory settings, and several recent field trials. Possible limitation in each production method and the challenges to be addressed for large scale production are discussed in detail. Whilst there are no technology stoppers to exploit or produce methane from hydrates, specific technological breakthroughs will depend on the effective management of the sand and water during production, as well as the appropriate mitigation of environmental risks.

40|$|Abstract: Compressed {{natural gas}} (CNG) {{is well known}} as one of the <b>cleanest</b> <b>burning</b> {{alternative}} fuels. Bi-fuel CNG vehicle can also run on gasoline or another fuel while dedicated natural gas vehicle is designed to run on natural gas only. Recently, increased attention has been focused on bi-fuel CNG/LPG taxi because of good fuel economy of CNG. A number of LPG taxis modified to CNG Bi-fuel vehicles are running in many cities. In this paper, the emissions characteristics of in-use passenger cars running on CNG and LPG were investigated. Chassis dynamometer test was used to measure exhaust emissions from an in-use fleet of 5 cars. Exhaust emissions were collected for CVS- 75 driving mode. The test results showed that for CNG fuel mode, CO, CO 2 and NMHC emissions decreased to 9 %, 12 % and 14 % respectively, and CH 4 and NOx emissions increased to 317 % and 47 % respectively...|$|R
50|$|In {{a natural}} gas powered vehicle, energy is {{released}} by combustion of essentially Methane gas (CH4) fuel with Oxygen (O2) {{from the air}} to CO2 and water vapor (H2O) in an internal combustion engine. Methane is the <b>cleanest</b> <b>burning</b> hydrocarbon although, as always, the cleanliness/ completeness of combustion depends on contaminants in the fuel, {{as well as the}} relative mixture and temperature of the reaction. Many of the contaminants present in natural gas at source are removed for its transport by pipeline and prior to open flame use in the home for cooking and heating, and almost all contaminants must be removed before it can be cooled down and liquefied to LNG for cost efficient long distance bulk batch transport, shipping and storage at close to atmospheric pressure. LNG regassifies as it absorbs heat from the surroundings, the rate of which depends on contact area. Therefore, in addition to the cryogenic challenges, small tank volumes of LNG regassify quickly without good insultation/ active cooling, making LNG rather unsuited for private vehicles that are not in continuous use.|$|R

40|$|This study reports {{emission}} {{factors of}} carbon monoxide and size-resolved aerosols from combustion of wood, dung cake, and biofuel briquette in traditional and improved stoves in India. Wood was the <b>cleanest</b> <b>burning</b> fuel, with higher emissions of CO from dung cake and particulate matter from both dung cake and briquette fuels. Combustion of dung cake, especially in an improved metal stove, resulted in extremely high pollutant emissions. Instead, biogas from anaerobic dung digestion should be promoted as a cooking fuel for public health protection. Pollutant emissions increased with increasing stove thermal efficiency, implying that thermal efficiency enhancement in the improved stoves was mainly from design features leading to increased heat transfer but not combustion efficiency. Compared to the traditional stove, the im proved stoves resulted in the lower pollutant emissions on a kW h(- 1) basis from wood combustion but in similar emissions from briquette and dung cake. Stove designs are needed with good emissions performance across multiple fuels.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{alternative}} fuels to replace liquid petroleum-based fuels has been accel-erated {{in recent years}} by environmental concerns, concerns of shortage of imported liquid hydrocarbon, and congressional prompting. The fact is accepted that natural gas is the cheapest, most domestically abundant, and <b>cleanest</b> <b>burning</b> of fossil fuels. However, socio-economical and technical handicaps associated with the safety and efficiency of on-board fuel storage inhibit its practical use in vehicles as an alternative fuel. A concept is presented for safely storing fuel at low pressures in the form of hydrates in natural gas vehicles. Experimental results lead to gas storage capacities of 143 to 159 volumes/volume. Vehicle travel range could be up to 204 mi. Controlled decomposition rate of hydrates is possible for feeding an automotive vehicle. Upon sudden pressure decrease {{in the event of a}} vehicle accident, the rate of release of hydrocarbons from the hydrates at constant temperature is 2. 63 to 12. 50 percent per min, slow enough to prevent an explosion or a fireball. A model is given for predicting the rates of gas release from hydrates in a vehicle wreck. A storage tank design is proposed and a process is suggested for forming and decomposing hydrates on-board vehicles. A consistent fuel composition is obtained with hydrates...|$|R

40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyIn {{this thesis}} three new {{technologies}} {{with the potential}} to significantly reduce the release of air emissions have been evaluated. The rigs considered are semi-submersibles and drillships as they have the capacity to reach ultradeep water sites. One potential method is to implement natural gas engines on MODUs, as natural gas is the <b>cleanest</b> <b>burning</b> fossil fuel. LNG will allow for 20 - 25 % lower CO 2 emissions and 90 - 95 % lower SOx emissions. In addition, the NOx emissions will be significantly reduced. The technology exists and is becoming widely accepted in the shipping industry. However, there may be problems during bunkering of LNG to floating rigs, as the temperature of LNG can be down to minus 170 degrees. When the LNG enters the bunkering hose it will freeze and become brittle. The risk of breakage will therefore be significant. An alternative potable tank transfer method may be a solution to this. Also the availability of LNG is currently insufficient as mobile rigs need fuel supply at varying locations. However, LNG will become more available in the future as several new LNG powered ships are under construction or planned for the next decade. Another measure is to implement new drilling technologies, which have the potential to reduce required rig size and indirectly reduce the air emissions. There are large differences in fuel consumption for the large and the small rigs, as large rigs have higher power requirements. In addition, larger rigs require more power for station keeping which is a major fuel consumer. The RDM-Riserless drilling method from Reelwell and the slim well drilling method both have a great potential to reduce required rig size. In this thesis a semi-submersible with a displacement of 53 000 mT and a drillship with a displacement of 84 000 mT have been used to estimate the weight reduction, due to less mud and riser tension required for the new drilling methods. The new displacements are used to find the typical fuel consumptions and thus the reduced air emissions. The reductions are significant. The RDM-R method allows for the largest reduction of the two drilling methods, with 24 % reduction of air emissions for the semi-submersible considered and 33 % for the drillship. The slim well drilling method has the potential to reduce the air emissions with approximately 19 % for semi-submersible and 31 % for the considered drillship. The reductions will vary from rig to rig as the VDL is not linear to the displacement. The drilling methods have the potential to be combined. The reductions are even larger, especially for the semi-submersible which allows for a reduction of 43 %. The drillship considered allows for a reduction of 38 % when the drilling methods are combined. Both methods will lower the cost of operation and may therefore be an attractive alternative in the future. The weight reduction is only based on mud and riser weights and one can expect even larger reductions in air emissions as BOP, Xmas tree, mud pumps and associated equipment are to be implemented in the calculations. To use LNG as fuel combined with the drilling methods may be attractive for new builds as LNG is a lower cost fuel than diesel...|$|R
