5|$|Although {{considered}} disgusting in Western culture, <b>cockroaches</b> are {{eaten in}} many places around the world. Whereas household pest <b>cockroaches</b> may carry bacteria and viruses, <b>cockroaches</b> bred under laboratory conditions {{can be used to}} prepare nutritious food. Common household <b>cockroaches</b> can be decontaminated by being isolated and fed a diet of apple and lettuce.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cockroaches</b> {{are social}} insects; {{a large number}} of species are either gregarious or {{inclined}} to aggregate, and a slightly smaller number exhibit parental care. It used to be thought that <b>cockroaches</b> aggregated because they were reacting to environmental cues, but it is now believed that pheromones are involved in these behaviors. Some species secrete these in their feces with gut microbial symbionts being involved, while others use glands located on their mandibles. Pheromones produced by the cuticle may enable <b>cockroaches</b> to distinguish between different populations of cockroach by odor. The behaviors involved have only been studied in a few species, but German <b>cockroaches</b> leave fecal trails with an odor gradient. Other <b>cockroaches</b> follow such trails to discover sources of food and water, and where other <b>cockroaches</b> are hiding. Thus, <b>cockroaches</b> have emergent behavior, in which group or swarm behavior emerges from a simple set of individual interactions.|$|E
5|$|Since the 19th century, {{scientists}} {{believed that}} <b>cockroaches</b> were an ancient group of insects {{that had a}} Devonian origin, according to one hypothesis. Fossil roachoids that lived during that time differ from modern <b>cockroaches</b> in having long external ovipositors and are the ancestors of mantises, as well as modern blattodeans. As the body, hind wings and mouthparts are not preserved in fossils frequently, the relationship of these roachoids and modern <b>cockroaches</b> remains disputed. The first fossils of modern <b>cockroaches</b> with internal ovipositors appeared in the early Cretaceous. A recent phylogenetic analysis suggests that <b>cockroaches</b> originated {{at least in the}} Jurassic.|$|E
50|$|Blaberus discoidalis, {{commonly}} known as the discoid <b>cockroach,</b> tropical <b>cockroach,</b> West Indian leaf <b>cockroach,</b> false death's head <b>cockroach,</b> Haitian <b>cockroach,</b> and drummer, is a <b>cockroach</b> native to Central America of the “giant cockroach” family, Blaberidae.|$|R

5|$|Anthony Donald Joseph Field, AM (born 8 May 1963) is an Australian {{musician}} and actor. He {{is best known}} {{as a member of the}} children's group The Wiggles and the 1980s and 1990s pop band The <b>Cockroaches.</b> While still a teenager, he helped found The <b>Cockroaches</b> with his brothers, Paul and John. The <b>Cockroaches</b> recorded two albums and enjoyed moderate success, interrupted by Field's service in Australia's regular army, until they disbanded in the late 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} long {{association}} with humans, <b>cockroaches</b> are frequently {{referred to in}} popular culture. In Western culture, <b>cockroaches</b> are often depicted as dirty pests. In a 1750–1752 journal, Peter Osbeck noted that <b>cockroaches</b> were frequently seen and {{found their way to}} the bakeries, after the sailing ship Gothenburg ran aground and was destroyed by rocks.|$|E
5|$|In China, <b>cockroaches</b> {{have become}} popular as {{medicine}} and cockroach farming is rising. The <b>cockroaches</b> are fried {{twice in a}} wok of hot oil, which makes them crispy with soft innards that are like cottage cheese. Fried <b>cockroaches</b> are ground and sold as pills for stomach, heart and liver diseases.|$|E
50|$|Although {{closely related}} to the American <b>cockroach</b> (Periplaneta americana), the smokybrown <b>cockroach</b> is readily {{distinguishable}} from it by its uniformly dark brown-mahogany coloration. Furthermore, unlike the American <b>cockroach,</b> which possess a light-rimmed pattern on its thorax, the smokybrown <b>cockroach's</b> thorax is dark and shiny.|$|R
50|$|The Asian <b>cockroach</b> {{is nearly}} {{identical}} to the German <b>cockroach</b> (Blattella germanica) {{except for a few}} minor morphological differences. Like the German <b>cockroach,</b> it is about 1.6 cm long, is tan to brown in color, and has wings. However, its wings are longer than the German <b>cockroach,</b> and {{there is a difference between}} a groove in the abdomen between the two species. There are other differences. The quickest way to tell the difference between the two species is that the Asian <b>cockroach</b> is a strong flyer (almost like a moth) and is attracted to light, unlike the German <b>cockroach.</b> This species tends to prefer the outdoors, whereas the German <b>cockroach</b> prefers living indoors.|$|R
50|$|The Florida woods <b>cockroach</b> (Eurycotis floridana), {{palmetto}} bug, {{is a large}} {{species of}} <b>cockroach</b> which typically grows to a length of 30 - 40 mm. When alarmed, adults can eject an extremely foul smelling directional spray up to one meter, which inspired several of its other common names: Florida skunk roach, Florida stinkroach, skunk <b>cockroach,</b> skunk roach, stinking <b>cockroach,</b> and stinkroach. Two other naming variations include Florida <b>cockroach</b> and Florida woods roach.|$|R

5|$|<b>Cockroaches</b> use pheromones {{to attract}} mates, and the males {{practice}} courtship rituals, such as posturing and stridulation. Like many insects, <b>cockroaches</b> mate {{facing away from}} each other with their genitalia in contact, and copulation can be prolonged. A few species are known to be parthenogenetic, reproducing without the need for males.|$|E

40|$|<b>Cockroach</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} pests in urban communities. This study was conducted to determine the situation of <b>cockroach</b> infestation and effective factors on <b>cockroach</b> trap count in urban communities of Yasuj City in southwestern Iran. In this study <b>cockroach</b> population in 573 sampling units (residential units, official places, and hospitals) was monitored using sticky traps over a five-week trapping period. Occupants of 348 residential units were also questioned (by means of questionnaire) for <b>cockroach</b> infestation in their respective residence. The study shows almost 39 % of sampling units were infested by <b>cockroach.</b> Five species from two families had been identified: Blattidae (comprising Blatta orientalis, B. lateralis, and Periplaneta americana) and Blattellidae (comprising Blattella germanica and Supella longipalpa). German <b>cockroach,</b> B. germanica, with widespreaddistribution (80 % of infested sampling units) showed the highest frequency (96. 7 %) of trap counts. The expression of the distribution of German <b>cockroach</b> populations and some factors could affect trapping, and population monitoring in an urban community was surveyed. Additionally, affecting some exclusion factors on <b>cockroach</b> infestation was pointed. Rates and source of <b>cockroach</b> infestation were discussed from the viewpoints of the residents...|$|R
5|$|Over 2,400 {{species of}} mantis in about 430 genera are recognized. They are {{predominantly}} found in tropical regions, but some live in temperate areas. The systematics of mantises {{have long been}} disputed. Mantises, along with stick insects (Phasmatodea), were once placed in the order Orthoptera with the <b>cockroaches</b> (now Blattodea) and rock crawlers (now Grylloblattodea). Kristensen (1991) combined the Mantodea with the <b>cockroaches</b> and termites into the order Dictyoptera, suborder Mantodea.|$|E
5|$|South American giant <b>cockroaches</b> of {{the genus}} Lucihormetica were {{believed}} to be the first known example of defensive mimicry, emitting light in imitation of bioluminescent, poisonous click beetles. However, doubt has been cast on this assertion, and there is no conclusive evidence that the <b>cockroaches</b> are bioluminescent.|$|E
5|$|When The <b>Cockroaches</b> disbanded in {{the early}} 1990s, Field {{enrolled}} at Macquarie University. While at university, he decided to record an album of children's music, enlisting the assistance of fellow student and guitarist Murray Cook, former <b>Cockroaches</b> roadie and vocalist Greg Page, former bandmate and keyboardist Jeff Fatt, and Macquarie instructor and composer Phillip Wilcher, who later left the group.|$|E
50|$|The American <b>cockroach</b> (Periplaneta americana), also colloquially {{known as}} the waterbug, but not a true waterbug since it is not aquatic, or misidentified as the {{palmetto}} bug (see Florida woods <b>cockroach</b> for the differences), is the largest species of common <b>cockroach,</b> and often considered a pest. It is also {{known as the}} ship <b>cockroach,</b> kakerlac, and Bombay canary.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Tropomyosin {{has been}} {{described}} as cross-reacting allergen between mite, <b>cockroach</b> and shrimp. METHODS: In 13 patients with asthma and/or rhinitis sensitized to mite and/or German <b>cockroach</b> and presenting urticaria, oral allergy syndrome or angio-edema upon eating shrimp and/or crab, we measured specific IgE to mite, <b>cockroach,</b> crab and shrimp tropomyosin. RESULTS: Ten patients had specific IgE to tropomyosin from mite, 8 from shrimp, 6 from crab and 5 from <b>cockroach.</b> AST inhibition tests indicated that mite allergen is a primary sensitizer and is cross-reacting with shrimp, crab and <b>cockroach</b> allergens. CONCLUSION: Tropomyosin could be the cross-reacting allergen relevant for clinical symptoms to mite, <b>cockroach,</b> shrimp and cra...|$|R
50|$|Blaptica dubia, the Dubia roach, {{also known}} as the orange-spotted <b>cockroach,</b> Guyana spotted <b>cockroach,</b> or Argentinian wood <b>cockroach,</b> is a {{medium-sized}} species of <b>cockroach</b> which grows to around 4.0 - 4.5 cm. They are sexually dimorphic; adult males have full wings covering their body, while females have only tiny wing stubs, their tegmina (forewings) being around a fourth of their body length.|$|R
5|$|Because {{of their}} ease of rearing and resilience, <b>cockroaches</b> {{have been used}} as insect models in the laboratory, {{particularly}} in the fields of neurobiology, reproductive physiology and social behavior.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cockroaches</b> {{appear to}} use just {{two pieces of}} {{information}} to decide where to go, namely how dark {{it is and how}} many other <b>cockroaches</b> there are. A study used specially-scented roach-sized robots that appear to the roaches as real to demonstrate that once there are enough insects in a place to form a critical mass, the roaches accepted the collective decision on where to hide, even if this was an unusually light place.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cockroaches</b> are {{abundant}} {{throughout the world}} and live {{in a wide range}} of environments, especially in the tropics and subtropics. <b>Cockroaches</b> can withstand extremely cold temperatures, allowing them to live in the Arctic. Some species are capable of surviving temperatures of −188°F (−122°C) by manufacturing an antifreeze made out of glycerol. In North America, 50 species separated into five families are found throughout the continent. 450 species are found in Australia. Only about four widespread species are commonly regarded as pests.|$|E
40|$|Currently, most <b>cockroach</b> {{control in}} urban {{environment}} relies on bait application. Aversion of some commercial bait by <b>cockroach</b> cause failure to control <b>cockroach</b> problems. Developing local bait can improve this situation. This research was aimed to find proper combination of some <b>cockroach</b> diet to be formulated in effective bait.
