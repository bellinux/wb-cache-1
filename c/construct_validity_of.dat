2500|$|As {{with any}} use of {{mathematical}} models, {{it is important}} to assess the fit of the data to the model. [...] If item misfit with any model is diagnosed as due to poor item quality, for example confusing distractors in a multiple-choice test, then the items may be removed from that test form and rewritten or replaced in future test forms. If, however, a large number of misfitting items occur with no apparent reason for the misfit, the <b>construct</b> <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the test will need to be reconsidered and the test specifications may need to be rewritten. Thus, misfit provides invaluable diagnostic tools for test developers, allowing the hypotheses upon which test specifications are based to be empirically tested against data.|$|E
2500|$|Addition {{of the new}} {{category}} to the DSM-system was recognized by the psychiatric press, and the New York Times. Several commentators have also offered their viewpoints. Chinen notes that the inclusion marks [...] "increasing professional acceptance of transpersonal issues", while Sovatsky sees the addition as an admittance of spiritually oriented narratives into mainstream clinical practice. Smart and Smart recognizes {{the addition of the}} category, and similar improvements in the fourth version, as a step forward for the cultural sensitivity of the DSM manual. Greyson, representing the field of Near-death studies, concludes that the diagnostic category of Religious or spiritual problem [...] "permits differentiation of near-death experiences and similar experiences from mental disorders".

The {{aim of this study}} was to establish the internal <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the TrEndo, a motion-tracking device, for implementation on a laparoscopic box trainer. Methods: Face validity and content validity were addressed through a structured questionnaire. To assess <b>construct</b> <b>validity,</b> participants were divided into an expert group and a novice group and performed two basic laparoscopic tasks. The TrEndo recorded five motion analysis parameters (MAPs) and time. Results: Participants demonstrated a high regard for face and content validity. All recorded MAPs differed significantly between experts and novices after performing a square knot. Overall, the TrEndo correctly assigned group membership in 84. 7 and 95. 7 % of cases based on two laparoscopic tasks.

5000|$|There are a lack {{of studies}} that support the <b>construct</b> <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the CD-RISC.
