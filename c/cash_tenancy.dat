25|$|Landlords opt for {{sharecropping}} {{to avoid}} the administrative costs and shirking that occurs on plantations and haciendas. It is preferred to <b>cash</b> <b>tenancy</b> because cash tenants take all the risks, and any harvest failure will hurt them and not the landlord. Therefore, they tend to demand lower rents than sharecroppers.|$|E
5000|$|Métayage {{was used}} {{early in the}} Middle Ages in {{northern}} France and the Rhinelands, where burgeoning prosperity encouraged large-scale vineyard planting, similar to what the ancient Romans had accomplished utilizing slave labor. The hyperinflation that followed the influx of Incan-American gold made Métayage preferable to <b>cash</b> <b>tenancy</b> and wage labour for both parties. Called complant, a laborer (in French prendeur, in Italian mezzadro) would offer to plant and tend to an uncultivated parcel of land belonging to a land owner (in French bailleur, in Italian concedente). The prendeur would have ownership of the vines and the bailleur would receive anywhere from a third to two-thirds of the vines' production {{in exchange for the}} use of his soil. [...] This system was used extensively in planting the Champagne region. Bailleur was also used as the name for the proprietor under métayage. The contract still exists today in Switzerland.|$|E
5000|$|According to {{the book}} The Making of the Philippines by Frank Senauth (p. 103): [...] "Marcos himself {{diverted}} large sums of government money to his party's campaign funds. Between 1972 and 1980, the average monthly income of wage workers had fallen by 20%. By 1981, the wealthiest 10% {{of the population was}} receiving twice as much income as the bottom 60%. From 1972 to 1980, agricultural production fell by 30%. With help from the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations, Marcos brought the Green Revolution (industrialized, chemical agriculture) to the Philippines. These reforms resulted in high profits for transnational corporations, but were generally harmful to small, peasant farmers who were often pushed into poverty. After declaring martial law in 1972, Marcos promised to implement agrarian reforms. However, the land reforms served largely to undermine Marcos's landholder opponents, not to lessen inequality in the countryside, and encouraged conversion to <b>cash</b> <b>tenancy</b> and greater reliance on farm workers. Under Marcos, timber products were among the nation's top exports but little attention was paid to the environmental impacts of deforestation as cronies never complied with reforestation agreements. By the early 1980s, forestry collapsed because most of the Philippines' accessible forests had been depleted—of the 12 million hectares of forestland, about 7 million had been left barren." ...|$|E
40|$|In the 19 th century, Eastern Spanish “huertas” {{witnessed}} a dramatic growth and intensification of their output, which {{was achieved by}} means of an agrarian development model based on a peasant economy and the cash renting of small plots. This paper looks at characteristics and longrun implications of that model. On the one hand, tenants were able throughout {{the second half of the}} century to remain on their farms for an increasingly longer period, and often they were eventually reimbursed by the improvements they had introduced. Because of that, agrarian production increased and improved, what allowed landlords to obtain a higher rent. But, on the other, landlords lost capacity to control and manage the tenant holdings. As a result, tenant farmers consolidated their position, becoming first “semi-owners” of the land they cultivated and, very often, legal proprietors afterwards.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{attempted}} {{to measure and}} compare resource use efficiency and relative productivity of farming under different tenure conditions {{in an area of}} Bhola district. A random sampling technique was used in the study. Sample farmers were classified as owner, crop share tenant and cash tenant farmers. A total of 90 samples, 30 from each class were {{selected on the basis of}} random sampling technique. The study explored the difference in the efficiency and productivity among owner, cash tenant and crop share tenant. Total cash expenses as well as total gross costs for producing HYV Boro rice was highest in owner farms and lowest in crop share tenant's farm. When individual inputs were concerned it was observed that expenses on human labor shared a major portion of expenses in the production of HYV Boro rice where owner operators used more hired labor in compare to other groups. However, the cash tenant farmers were more efficient than owner and crop share tenant farmers. Due to poor resource base the crop share tenants were unable to invest on modern farm inputs. It may be mentioned that in Bangladesh the predominant tenancy arrangement is share cropping, which is an inefficient form of tenure arrangement in compare to <b>cash</b> <b>tenancy...</b>|$|E
