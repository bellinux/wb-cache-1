This paper outlines {{the ways in which}} micro blasted tools, both coated and un coated have benefited from shot blasting and resulted in greater productivity, lower cutting forces, improved surface finish of the work pieces and less machine downtime. The process of micro blasting is discussed in the paper. Its effectiveness depends on many parameters including the shot media ad size, the mechanics of impact and the application of the shot via the micro shot blasting unit. Control of the process to provide repeatability and reliability in the shot blasting unit is discussed.

Hodnotím Mn ocel z hlediska struktury a její vlastnosti vytvrzovat při obrábění (soustružení, frézování), což vyžaduje speciální metody při opracování. Obecně se zmiňuji o soustružení a frézování, kde jsem se soustředil hlavně na použití nejvhodnějších břitových destiček do obráběcích strojů. Popisuji výrobu destiček ze SK několikrát povlakovaných, které se nejlépe osvědčily při opracování konkrétních výrobků. Jedná se o srdcovky pro železnice a o kužely drtících mlýnů ve Slévárnách Třinec. Z parametrů použitých břitových destiček firmy PRAMET, které jsou z kubických karbidů a jsou opatřeny multivrstevnatým nanostrukturním povlakem, a z naměřených hodnot při frézování a soustružení jsem vypočítal náklady na frézování a soustružení.

50|$|The {{beginnings}} of modern wood engraving techniques {{developed at the}} end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, with the works of Englishman Thomas Bewick.

Finding a woodcutting knife not suitable for working against the grain in harder woods, Bewick used a burin (or graver), an engraving tool with a V-shaped <b>cutting</b> <b>tip.</b> From the beginning of the nineteenth century Bewick's techniques gradually came into wider use, especially in Britain and the United States.|$|E
50|$|Carbide is more {{expensive}} per unit than other typical tool materials, and it is more brittle, making it susceptible to chipping and breaking. To offset these problems, the carbide <b>cutting</b> <b>tip</b> itself is often {{in the form of}} a small insert for a larger tipped tool whose shank is made of another material, usually carbon tool steel. This gives the benefit of using carbide at the cutting interface without the high cost and brittleness of making the entire tool out of carbide. Most modern face mills use carbide inserts, as well as many lathe tools and endmills. In recent decades, though, solid-carbide endmills have also become more commonly used, wherever the application's characteristics make the pros (such as shorter cycle times) outweigh the cons (mentioned above).|$|E
50|$|Almost all {{high-performance}} {{cutting tools}} use indexable inserts. There {{are several reasons}} for this. First of all, at the very high cutting speeds and feeds supported by these materials, the <b>cutting</b> <b>tip</b> can reach temperatures high enough to melt the brazing material holding it to the shank. Economics are also important; inserts are made symmetrically {{so that when the}} first cutting edge is dull they can be rotated, presenting a fresh cutting edge. Some inserts are even made {{so that they can be}} flipped over, giving as many as 16 cutting edges per insert. There are many types of inserts: some for roughing, some for finishing. Others are made for specialized jobs like cutting threads or grooves. The industry employs standardized nomenclature to describe inserts by shape, material, coating material, and size.|$|E

The use of hardplate ensures that conventional drilling is not successful when used against the safe.
