40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the issue of {{watermarking}} 2 D-vector data which are used in Geographical Information Systems (GIS). The watermark is embedded in the tolerance range of the coordinates, where one bit of the watermarking information is represented by one PN-sequence, whose elements consist of the two values "+tolerance" and "-tolerance". To robustly embed one bit of the watermarking information the length of the PN- sequence has to be much greater than the square of the maximum <b>coordinate</b> <b>value</b> leading to non-acceptable sequence lengths due to high coordinate values. To achieve a PN-sequence length that is suitable {{to the size of the}} data domain we do not consider the whole <b>coordinate</b> <b>value</b> but only those decimal digit positions of the <b>coordinate</b> <b>value,</b> where changes are significant but not violating the tolerance requirements. Due to this restriction on a smaller range of values, overflow and underflow has to be considered during the embedding process. Within the retrieval process we first extract this fraction of the <b>coordinate</b> <b>value</b> before correlating it with the PN-sequence. The proposed method is robust against attackers changing the coordinates within the tolerance range...|$|E

Methods: Optimal head axial and coronal 3. 0 T, T 2 -weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI) of 30 patients were obtained. Cross-sectional head images of four CVH head datasets were chosen to establish an average CVH model. All MRI sequences were registered to the CVH model via fiducials in X-, Y-, and Z-direction, respectively, within the same stereotactic space. The correlations between red nucleus (RN) and fiducials, the accuracy of MRI-to-CVH registration, and the <b>coordinate</b> <b>value</b> differences of RN gravity center between MRI and CVH were tested. Results: The mean gravity center coordinate values and ranges of STN in CVH were measured; The X <b>coordinate</b> <b>value</b> of RN positively correlates with the most anterior point of putamen(PU-A), the lateral edges of putamens (PU-L), and width of the third ventricle, negatively correlated with the patients ’ age; The minimal mean errors were when no fiducials were used when locating RN between the MRI and the CVH average model; There {{were no significant differences}} of RN in X- and Y-direction between MRI sequences and CVH.
