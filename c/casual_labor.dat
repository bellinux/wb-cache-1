No one would doubt that some migrant workers came to Palestine from Syria and Trans-Jordan and remained there. But one has to add to this that there were migrations in the opposite direction as well. For example, a tradition developed in Hebron to go to study and work in Cairo, with the result that a permanent community of Hebronites had been living in Cairo since the fifteenth century.

The analysis indicates that the distribution of resources is highly favorable to higher caste and has direct impact on household food security condition.

Both depth and severity are higher in occupational caste, small landholders, fewer livestock holders, laborers, and households with less consumption expenses.

Numerous works, mainly from the anthropological perspective, have documented the conflict-ridden industry and offered explanations {{for the development of}} community antagonism (see, eg, Filer 1990; Connell and Howitt 1991; Rumsey and Weiner 2001). However, the existing literature on mining is somewhat sparse {{when it comes to the}} participation of Papua New Guineans as employees in the mines. The major aim of this paper is to discuss local employment in Papua New Guinea mines. It does so by examining some of the challenges and conflicts that Papua New Guineans have confronted since their first con-tact with mining in the late 1800 s as adventurers and assistants to their participation as full-fledged paid workers in the current period. A central theme of this paper is that, although they first embraced mining as an adventure, the inevitable imposition of a capitalistic mode of mining operation compelled them to render their labor for a wage. Like miners everywhere, this paper argues, many Papua New Guineans now view mining employment as “the only way ” rather than as one of many ways of making a living. Labor, Conflict, and Mining in Premodern Papua New Guinea Papua New Guineans have had contact with the international mining industry since the late 1800 s. Colonial officials, planters, soldiers, and missionaries provided other major avenues of contact with westerners (West 1958; Waiko 1993, 34).

My estimates are from a field experiment in which 529 adults from ten different villages are offered a day’s work once per week for 12 consecutive weeks. Each village faces a different wage each week; wages range from MK 30 ($US 0. 21) to MK 140 ($US 1. 00) per day. I observe whether or not each individual works at each wage.

To do this we conduct a large-scale randomized control trial, covering over 21, 000 households in 1, 309 villages surveyed four times over a seven year period, to evaluate a nationwide program in Bangladesh that transfers livestock assets and skills to the poorest women. At baseline, the poorest women mostly engage in low return and seasonal <b>casual</b> wage <b>labor</b> while wealthier women solely engage in livestock rearing. The program enables poor women to start engaging in livestock rearing, increasing their aggregate labor supply and earnings. This leads to asset accumulation (livestock, land and business assets) and poverty reduction, both sustained after four and seven years. These gains do not crowd out the livestock businesses of noneligible households while the wages these receive for casual jobs increase as the poor reduce their labor supply.

There is a widespread perception in the region that globalization and economic integration are making training policies more important.

AbstractThis article seeks {{to explain the}} {{practices}} used by small farmers to cope with climate variability and extreme weather events in the basins of the Chinchiná and Porce rivers located on the central Andes in Colombia. The information wasglacie collected through interviews, observations on farms and workshops with farmers. Additionally historical averages on temperature, precipitation and sunshine were compared with those values recorded in 2010 during the transition between El Niño an La Niña events. During {{the first quarter of}} 2010 the average temperature in Chinchiná increased by 1. 4 C° and the solar brightness by 14 %, while the precipitation experienced a 46 % reduction. In contrast, {{during the second half of}} the year there was a decrease of 0. 8 C° in temperature, a 31 % reduction in solar brightness and an increase in precipitation of 62 %. The coffee production in the years 2011 and 2012 was the lowest in the country in the last 35 years despite the cultivated area increased. These changes affected the coffee plantations and substantially decreased grain coffe production. Coffee production in the years 2011 and 2012 was the lowest in the country in the last 35 years despite the cultivated area increase. These fall in coffee production was also a result of the renewal with rust resistant varieties, which at that time had not yet begun to produce. Most of the farmers have 5 hectares or less and are union members in the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia (fncc), which provides multiple services to them including an extension service with spread of the findings of field investigations carried out by the National Coffee Research Center (cenicafe). These study results indicates some strategies used by peasants to minimize the effects of climate variability: the shade management in coffee plantations, especially with banana (Musa sp.) and guamo (Inga sp); their renewal with the rust resistant variety named Castillo; the association of crops, particularly coffee, maize and bean; the use of mulches, organic fertilizers and mycorrhizae; a proper fertilization; the cultivation of two-axis coffee plants; the staggered planting of coffee in different plots and the reforestation of hillsides and births water, especially with (Guadua angustifolia), are strategies used to minimize the effects of climate variability. However these strategies are more frequent in Porce than in Chinchiná where sun coffee plantations and intensive agriculture are predominants. The article indicates that adaptation to climate variability is not achieved only by technological measures if do not decrease the sources of vulnerability of the rural population. The farmers are more exposed to the effects of weather because of their poverty, as a result of building on steep slopes, by cause of the volatility in the international price of coffee, by virtue of the exchange rate, due to the lack of a culture of crop insurance and for the lack of generational renewal in agriculture. Additionally peasants in Chinchiná faced threats of earthquakes, eruption of Nevado del Ruiz volcano, susceptibility of volcanic soils to mass removals and glacier melting, an increasingly process accelerated by climate change. This paper also highlights the social, economic and political adaptation strategies to climate variability. We found that the resilience of rural households increases when resorting to agrotourism, integration of family labor, associations, political mobilization for claiming benefits, <b>casual</b> wage <b>labor</b> on other farms, integration to fair markets coffee and coffee certifications that increase the price of This work also highlights the social, economic and political adaptation strategies to climate variability.

40|$|The paper reviews {{labor market}} {{developments}} in the transition economies of Europe and Central Asia. It argues that the scarcity of productive job opportunities and the growing labor market segmentation are the two main labor market problems facing the transition economies. In the European transition economies thelack of jobs has led to persistent open unemployment. In the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) {{it has led to}} hidden unemployment (underemployment and low productivity employment). Unemployment in the European transition economies is supported by the developed social safety net. In contrast, in the CIS for most workers unemployment is not an affordable option. They either stick to their old, unproductive jobs in unrestructured enterprises, or work in the informal sector, or resort to subsistence agriculture. Thus, underemployment in the CIS is a mirror image of unemployment in the European transition economies. Accordingly, the high employment-to-population ratios in many CIS countries do not necessarily signify favorable labor market performance. Instead they often indicate delayed enterprise restructuring, the maintenance of unsustainable jobs in uncompetitive firms, and the existence of a large informal sector as an employer of last resort. Labor market segmentation has been caused by a sharp increase in earnings differentials and the attendant increase in the incidence of low-paid jobs, by the polarization of regional labor market conditions, and finally by the growth of the informal sector offering <b>casual,</b> low-productivity jobs. <b>Labor</b> market segmentation and accompanying inequalities are more pronounced in the CIS than in the European transition economies.

60|$|In short, when Major Barbara {{says that}} there are no scoundrels, she is right: there are no {{absolute}} scoundrels, though there are impracticable people of whom I shall treat presently. Every practicable man (and woman) is a potential scoundrel and a potential good citizen. What a man is depends on his character; but what he does, and what we think of what he does, depends on his circumstances. The characteristics that ruin a man in one class make him eminent in another. The characters that behave differently in different circumstances behave alike in similar circumstances. Take a common English character like that of Bill Walker. We meet Bill everywhere: on the judicial bench, on the episcopal bench, in the Privy Council, at the War Office and Admiralty, {{as well as in the}} Old Bailey dock or in the ranks of <b>casual</b> unskilled <b>labor.</b> And the morality of Bill's characteristics varies with these various circumstances. The faults of the burglar are the qualities of the financier: the manners and habits of a duke would cost a city clerk his situation. In short, though character is independent of circumstances, conduct is not; and our moral judgments of character are not: both are circumstantial. Take any condition of life in which the circumstances are for a mass of men practically alike: felony, the House of Lords, the factory, the stables, the gipsy encampment or where you please! In spite of diversity of character and temperament, the conduct and morals of the individuals in each group are as predicable and as alike in the main as if they were a flock of sheep, morals being mostly only social habits and circumstantial necessities. Strong people know this and count upon it. In nothing have the master-minds of the world been distinguished from the ordinary suburban season-ticket holder more than in their straightforward perception of the fact that mankind is practically a single species, and not a menagerie of gentlemen and bounders, villains and heroes, cowards and daredevils, peers and peasants, grocers and aristocrats, artisans and laborers, washerwomen and duchesses, in which all the grades of income and caste represent distinct animals who must not be introduced to one another or intermarry. Napoleon constructing a galaxy of generals and courtiers, and even of monarchs, out of his collection of social nobodies; Julius Caesar appointing as governor of Egypt the son of a freedman--one who but a short time before would have been legally disqualified for the post even of a private soldier in the Roman army; Louis XI making his barber his privy councillor: all these had in their different ways a firm hold of the scientific fact of human equality, expressed by Barbara in the Christian formula that all men are children of one father. A man who believes that men are naturally divided into upper and lower and middle classes morally is making exactly the same mistake as the man who believes that they are naturally divided in the same way socially. And just as our persistent attempts to found political institutions on a basis of social inequality have always produced long periods of destructive friction relieved from time to time by violent explosions of revolution; so the attempt--will Americans please note--to found moral institutions on a basis of moral inequality can lead to nothing but unnatural Reigns of the Saints relieved by licentious Restorations; to Americans who have made divorce a public institution turning the face of Europe into one huge sardonic smile by refusing to stay in the same hotel with a Russian man of genius who has changed wives without the sanction of South Dakota; to grotesque hypocrisy, cruel persecution, and final utter confusion of conventions and compliances with benevolence and respectability. It is quite useless to declare that all men are born free if you deny that they are born good. Guarantee a man's goodness and his liberty will take care of itself. To guarantee his freedom on condition that you approve of his moral character is formally to abolish all freedom whatsoever, as every man's liberty is at the mercy of a moral indictment, which any fool can trump up against everyone who violates custom, whether as a prophet or as a rascal. This is the lesson Democracy has to learn before it can become anything but the most oppressive of all the priesthoods.|$|R

Later the term acquired a narrower meaning, to refer only to those who prefer the transient way of life. Writing in 1877 Allan Pinkerton said:"The tramp has always existed in some form or other, and he will continue on his wanderings until the end of time; but {{there is no question that}} he has come into public notice, particularly in America, to a greater extent during the present decade than ever before."Author Bart Kennedy, a self-described tramp of 1900 America, once said [...] "I listen to the tramp, tramp of my feet, and wonder where I was going, and why I was going."

No one would doubt that some migrant workers came to Palestine from Syria and Trans-Jordan and remained there. But one has to add to this that there were migrations in the opposite direction as well. For example, a tradition developed in Hebron to go to study and work in Cairo, with the result that a permanent community of Hebronites had been living in Cairo since the fifteenth century. Trans-Jordan exported unskilled <b>casual</b> <b>labor</b> to Palestine; but before 1948 its civil service attracted a good many educated Palestinian Arabs who did not find work in Palestine itself. Demographically speaking, however, neither movement of population was significant in comparison to the decisive factor of natural increase.Daniel Pipes responded to Porath by granting that From Time Immemorial quoted carelessly, used statistics sloppily, and ignored inconvenient facts. Nonetheless, he explained that:Miss Peters's central thesis is that a substantial immigration of Arabs to Palestine took place during the first half of the twentieth century. She supports this argument with an array of demographic statistics and contemporary accounts, the bulk of which have not been questioned by any reviewer, including Porath.Porath replied with an array of demographic data to support his position. He also wrote that Peters's demographic statistics were inexplicable: ...nowhere in her main text or in the methodological appendices (V and VI) did Mrs. Peters bother to explain to her readers how she managed to break down the Ottoman or Cuinet's figures into smaller units than subdistricts. As far as I know no figures for the units smaller than subdistricts (Nahia; the parallel of the French commune), covering the area of Ottoman Palestine, were ever published. Therefore I can't avoid the conclusion that Mrs. Peters's figures were, at best, based on guesswork and an extremely tendentious guesswork at that.|$|E
5000|$|At 18, {{she began}} {{working as a}} secretary, while also writing. Her [...] "Charades For Home Acting" [...] (44 pp.) was {{published}} by Woodford Fawcett and Co. in 1888, then [...] "Sapho", an epic poem 210 pages long, was published by Kegan Paul, Trench and Co. in 1889, at her own expense. She followed with [...] "Idylls of Womanhood", a collection of poems published by William Heinemann in 1892. She did not marry until she was 33, to a medical doctor Horatio Francis Ninian Scott. They lived in London (Hanover Square), where their first child, Marjorie Catharine W. Scott, was born in 1899, then a son, Horatio Christopher L. Scott, in March 1901. Then {{the family moved to}} West Cowes on the Isle of Wight in the summer of 1902, where they lived for the next seven years and another child, Walter Scott, nicknamed Toby, was born in June 1904. Mrs. Dawson-Scott freed completely from daily household duties after the birth of the third child, enjoying the more relaxed country life, started writing again and in 1906, at 41, published her first novel [...] "The Story of Anna Beames" [...] under a pen name of Mrs. Sappho. Two years later came her second novel, [...] "The Burden", under her name of C.A. Dawson Scott. She was becoming so productive that she produced seven more books in six years until the outbreak of World War I in 1914, including in 1909 [...] "Treasure Trove", [...] "The Agony Column", and in 1910 [...] "Madcap Jane". Then in 1910, the Scott family moved back closer to London and Mrs Dawson-Scott could join London's literary circle, now an author with a few publications to her name. A few more came: [...] "Mrs Noakes, An Ordinary Woman" [...] and a guide (with map) called [...] "Nooks And Corners of Cornwall" [...] in 1911. In 1912 Mrs Dawson-Scott met poet Charlotte Mary Mew, who supposedly had read her [...] "Macap Jane". In the summer of 1913, Catherine Dawson-Scott asked Charlotte Mew to her home in Southall to recite a few poems to a small group of acquaintances — but the self-conscious poet only consented a year later, and the reading on 16 March 1914 was a great success, the mystic poet Evelyn Underhill apparently getting journalist and critic Rolfe Scott-James, then the time editor of the highly regarded New Weekly, interested in Mew, as her ‘Fame’ did appear in the magazine in May — only two months after her reading. At that time, Dawson-Scott was also engaged in, or had just finished, editing the poems of her deceased cousin, Henry Dawson Lowry, and writing her own poems. When World War I broke out, her husband was enlisted into the Royal Army Medical Corps and was sent to France while Catherine A., {{with the support of the}} British secretary of state for war Lord Horatio Herbert Kitchener, is credited with the creation of the Woman's Defence Relief Corps in late August 1914. The corps was made up of two divisions: civil section, to substitute women for men in factories and other places of employment in order to free those men for military service; and a “semi-military” or “good citizen” section, for active recruitment of women for the armed forces, to be trained in drilling, marching and the use of arms so they could protect themselves and their loved ones on the home front in case of enemy invasion. In effect, in the spring of 1915 members of the Corp started working on the land, and in 1916, 465 women were organized in squads for land work, to be exploited as <b>casual</b> <b>labor.</b> Later, her husband began to suffer from depression and eventually they divorced.

40|$|There’s more to {{unemployment}} than official figures show, writes John Quiggin UNEMPLOYMENT {{has ceased}} to rank among the principal concerns of voters or political parties. In the most recent Newspoll about voters’ concerns, unemployment ranked seventh, just ahead of taxation, though it was still judged an important concern by 60 per cent of respondents. To judge by political discussion, the issue has a priority even lower than this. Political debate over employment and unemployment is confined almost entirely {{to the question of}} job security. The government has long argued that present protections against unfair dismissal discourage job creation. By contrast, Labor seeks to extend many of the rights of permanent employees to the rapidly growing proportion of the workforce employed on a <b>casual</b> basis. <b>Labor</b> has also proposed Youth Guarantee, aimed at reducing youth unemployment. With these modest exceptions, both parties are prepared to rely on the policy judgement of the Reserve Bank to provide the macro-economic conditions for reductions in unemployment. The bank, while far less dogmatic than some of its counterparts overseas, has adopted a strategy focused primarily on inflation-targeting, with stability in output growth as a secondary objective. This general pattern of benign neglect might seem justified in view of the recent announcement that the rate of unemployment has fallen to 5. 5 per cent, the lowest since 1981. There are, however, a number of reasons why we should not be so complacent. First, the two figures are not comparable, particularly as they relate to unemployment among men still the primary earners in most Australian households. Since 1982, large numbers of men have withdrawn from the labour force, going onto disability benefits, early access to the age pension, involuntary early retirement, or simply falling through the cracks and disappearing from the statistics. The most clear-cut case is that of disability benefits. Changes in the workforce have meant that even quite mild disabilities make it virtually impossible to secure and hold a full-time job. These changes have more than offset legislative measures aimed at reducing discrimination against people with disabilities. Adding in those on disability benefits would roughly double the measured unemployment rate today. By contrast, making the same adjustment in 1981 would have added only a couple of percentage points. The comparison would look even worse if other forms of hidden unemployment were taken into account. Even on the official statistics, the pace of reduction has been painfully slow. After peaking at 11 per cent in 1992, the rate of unemployment fell to 8 per cent in 1995. It has taken almost 10 years to achieve a reduction of only 2. 5 percentage points. And even this reduction has been achieved only following one of the longest expansions in Australia’s history. This expansion cannot be relied upon to continue forever. There is, of course, a self-congratulatory view that the length and robustness of our expansion is due not to good luck and the good macroeconomic judgement of the Reserve Bank, but to the greater flexibility of the economy arising from microeconomic reform. This {{is not the first time}} such a view has been put forward. Most recently, the impressive boom experienced by the United States in the 1990 s was explained in much the same way. Since US labour markets are considerably less tightly regulated than those in Australia or anywhere else in the developed world, this view had a lot of appeal. It did not, however, prevent the US from going into recession in 2001. And, despite the relatively mild impact of that recession in output, it has not permitted a rapid recovery in employment, which is still far below the level prevailing in 2000. And it’s not necessary to look abroad to see how dubious this argument is. Exactly the same claims about flexibility and dynamism were being made on the eve of the ‘recession we had to have’. The third and final problem is a more direct legacy of neglect. Apart from the brief experiment with the Working Nation program in the early 1990 s, Australia has no significant experience with active labour market policy. Labor cut Working Nation back in the 1995 budget and the Howard government scrapped it completely in 1996. As a result, if we are unfortunate enough to experience another recession, we will have to start from scratch in responding to the resulting unemployment. We had all better hope that the housing bubble deflates slowly and smoothly.
