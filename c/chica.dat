5|$|The {{powerful}} {{winds of}} Hurricane John produced heavy surf and downed trees near Acapulco. The hurricane produced a 10foot (3m) storm surge in Acapulco that flooded coastal roads. In addition, John caused heavy rainfall {{along the western}} coast of Mexico, peaking at 12.5inches (317.5mm) in Los Planes, Jalisco. The rainfall resulted in mudslides in the Costa <b>Chica</b> region of Guerrero, leaving around 70communities isolated.|$|E
5|$|After {{emerging}} {{into the}} Straits of Florida on September21, the storm resumed intensification, before striking near Boca <b>Chica</b> Key, Florida with winds of 120mph (195km/h). By early on September22, the system peaked as a Category4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 130mph (215km/h). Shortly thereafter, another landfall occurred near Chokoloskee, Florida {{at the same}} intensity. Severe damage {{was reported in the}} state due to strong winds. The storm was considered the worst in Key West since the 1919 Florida Keys hurricane. Throughout the state, 1,200homes were severely damaged or destroyed, while 40businesses were demolished and 237suffered impact. Throughout Florida, there were three fatalities and approximately $12million (1948USD) in damage, over half of which was inflicted on crops. The storm rapidly weakened while crossing the state and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean as only a Category1 hurricane later on September22. Slight fluctuations in intensity occurred before the hurricane became extratropical early on September24, while located northwest of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|On occasion, the {{convection}} of {{the system}} would flare up, {{and in the early}} morning hours of November 3, the Naval Air Station at Boca <b>Chica,</b> Florida reported winds of 50mph (80km/h), which would mean the depression may have attained tropical storm status. A similar report was filed at the Air Force Station at Cudjoe Key. After another reconnaissance flight was sent out to study the system, and recorded that surface area temperatures had dropped, the flight-level winds had reached 92mph (147km/h) and the surface area pressure had reached 998millibars (29.47 inHg). In the evening and overnight hours of November 3, the tropical depression continued to the northeast, making landfall in Florida at a location near Tampa Bay. The depression crossed Florida, weakening significantly, and becoming extratropical. After emerging from land in the Atlantic Ocean on November 5, the depression had become a low pressure area once again and was last spotted that day near the Carolina Capes.|$|E

5|$|The mantles of the Muisca were {{decorated}} with various colours. The colours {{were obtained from}} seeds; the seed of the avocado for green, flowers; saffron for orange and indigo weed for blue, fruits, crust and roots of plants, from animals as the cochineal insect producing purple colours, and minerals as the blue and green clays of Siachoque, the coloured earth of Suta and the yellow sediments of Soracá. Also curuba, the flowers of the potato plant (Solanum andigenum) and other colouring materials (Rumex obtusifolia, Bixa orellana, Arrabidaea <b>chica</b> and more) were used. The colours were applied using pencils, applying coloured threads or using stamps. The textiles were produced using various techniques, similar to the Aymara of southern South America and the Mesoamerican cultures. Small textiles functioned as money, just like the tejuelos of gold or salt was used.|$|E
25|$|Bolsa <b>Chica</b> State Beach is {{operated}} by the State of California, Dept. Parks & Recreation, and the Bolsa <b>Chica</b> State Beach Lifeguards. The beach is very narrow and the sand is very coarse. Bolsa <b>Chica</b> tends to have better surf with NW/W swells during the winter season. During the summer months the beach picks up south/southwest swells at a very steep angle. Due {{to the bottom of}} the beach, surf at Bolsa <b>Chica</b> tends to be slowed down and refined to soft shoulders. Longboards are the best option for surfing in the Bolsa <b>Chica</b> area.|$|E

In Veracruz, best known “African” dances include Los Negritos, along with various huapangos and sons. In the Costa <b>Chica,</b> the best known of these dances include Los Diablos, Las Tortugas and Toro de Petate.|$|E
