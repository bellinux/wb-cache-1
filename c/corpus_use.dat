40|$|How can {{the effects}} of corpora on the {{language}} learning process be effectively assessed? This is an old question which is, however, just as important now as it was ten or twenty years ago. Does <b>corpus</b> <b>use</b> aid students in a measurable way? How does <b>corpus</b> <b>use</b> affect students’ subsequent language use? Is there a marked qualitative difference between the work of students who make use of corpora in their studies {{and those who do}} not? Does <b>corpus</b> <b>use</b> necessarily lead to an improvement in students’ language production? This research reports an ongoing study into phraseological production in advanced learner writing (Philip 2005 a; 2005 b; 2006 /forthcoming); in particular, it investigates <b>corpus</b> <b>use</b> and non-use in a semi-structured writing task. Unlike other studies in the EFL literature, this research examines multiple versions of a single base text, making it possible to observe what effect the use of corpora has on the production of phraseological units in text, rather than in gap-fill sentences or other, more traditional types of elicitation experiment, such as those found in Deignan et al. (1997 and Boers (2000). The rationale behind the present approach is influenced by the use of parallel corpora in translation studies in which multiple versions of single texts – in two or more languages – can be visualised and examined as KWIC concordances. The data presented here has been gathered from five groups of advanced learners between March 2005 and June 2006. The learners, following advanced (C 1) general English courses at the University of Bologna. Four of the groups have used corpora during the course of their studies; of these four groups of corpus users, two have used corpora extensively, and have been taught how to carry out advanced searches (multiple nodes, wildcards, and node plus tag). The fifth group, having had no exposure to language corpora, serves as a control...|$|E

30|$|The {{third factor}} to be {{considered}} is language proficiency and training. It is usually believed that DDL may appeal more to advanced learners. Just as shown by O’Sullivan and Chambers (2006), the post-graduates showed {{more positive attitudes toward}} <b>corpus</b> <b>use</b> than the undergraduates. What’s more, Granath (2009) also stated that advanced learners usually benefit more from a DDL approach. Nonetheless, with proper training, DDL could be also effective for lower-level learners as well as advanced learners. As stated by Boulton (2009), for intermediate or lower-level learners, it is crucial to organize the training session to improve their corpus techniques for DDL to be successful. Therefore a lot of studies (e.g. Yoon and Hirvela 2004; O’Sullivan and Chambers 2006; Gilmore 2009; Chang and Sun 2009; Smart 2014) have designed the training session about consultation skills prior to learners’ independent use of corpora. For instance, Gilmore’s (2009) study found that the intermediate-level Japanese university students were able to significantly improve the naturalness of their redrafted essays with a merely 90 -min training about how to use online corpora. Chang and Sun (2009) also showed students performed better in the revision tasks with the aid of scaffolding prompts or teachers’ instructions. In Yoon and Hirvela’s (2004) study, due to receiving more direct training and practice in <b>corpus</b> <b>use,</b> the intermediate students reported fewer problems in corpus search techniques than the advanced students, and they showed more positive attitudes towards <b>corpus</b> <b>use.</b> Although the study conducted by Boulton (2009) proved that lower-level learners could also benefit a lot from DDL in learning linking adverbials in writing without prior training, an overwhelming majority of studies reveal that appropriate training is helpful to maximize the advantages of DDL activities for both lower-level and higher-level students, especially for Asian students who are not accustomed to this exploratory learning approach.|$|E

The research was mainly based on case studies with six L 2 writers in an English for Academic Purposes writing course. The findings revealed that <b>corpus</b> <b>use</b> not only had an immediate effect by helping the students solve immediate writing/language problems, but also promoted their perceptions of lexico-grammar and language awareness. Once the corpus approach was introduced to the writing process, the students assumed more responsibility for their writing and became more independent writers, and their confidence in writing increased. This study identified a wide variety of individual experiences and learning contexts that were involved in deciding the levels of the students ’ willingness and success in using corpora. This paper also discusses the distinctive contributions of general corpora to English for Academic Purposes and the importance of lexical and grammatical aspects in L 2 writing pedagogy...|$|E

40|$|The use of corpora in {{language}} {{teaching and learning}} (data-driven learning, or DDL) has generated considerable interest {{over the last two}} decades. However, a survey of this research shows a surprising lack of empirical studies regarding the key question of whether <b>corpus</b> <b>use</b> leads to effective language learning. We look first at a series of studies of our own focusing on lower-level learners' ability to exploit concordances for specific linguistic outcomes in English. In line with other studies, we find that: (a) the results are generally positive (i. e. learning happens); while (b) the impact of <b>corpus</b> <b>use</b> appears to be smaller than might have been hoped. We go on to suggest that this may be one explanation for the paucity of published empirical research in DDL. Although DDL might not reveal dramatic results overall, it might be that it is appropriate for certain types of learner or certain types of activity, and thus could form part of the general collection of techniques available. More importantly, even if immediate results in experimental conditions are mitigated, it may be that students can become “better learners” as a result of corpus investigation and corpus techniques. This possibility was examined in a second study involving French corpora in a sociolinguistics course. The participants typically felt that their language mastery and also general awareness and understanding of language issues improved as a result of corpus work. In terms of language pedagogy, we suggest that DDL is beneficial for developing learner autonomy, promoting long-term learning precisely because an inductive DDL approach leads to greater awareness of the types of problems that learners are faced with...|$|E

40|$|International audienceCorpora and {{associated}} tools represent a powerful, empirical research methodology that spreads beyond {{the discipline of}} corpus linguistics. They have long been used to inform language teaching and materials (Johns, 1986) and are now used increasingly {{in the learning process}} itself. However, given the wide range of teaching/learning contexts, learner profiles, languages, corpora, software, approaches, experimental designs, etc., {{it can be difficult to}} make sense of the state of research. The traditional literature review retains a high degree of subjectivity - selecting papers to review, deciding on their relative importance, interpreting results, and producing generalisations. In contrast, a meta-analysis is as comprehensive and objective as possible. This paper presents a meta-analysis of empirical research evaluating an effect of <b>corpus</b> <b>use</b> in language learning, broadly following approaches laid out in Norris and Ortega (2000) and Spada and Tomita (2010). An initial collection of 132 papers is reduced to 21 which meet inclusion criteria for this first version meta-analysis. Preliminary results from pre/post-test designs suggest a mean gain effect of 1. 68 standard deviations (d =. 84); experimental/control group results are predictably somewhat lower at 1. 04 (d =. 73); both fall comfortably within 95 % confidence limits and can be characterised as "strong" even by the exacting standards proposed by Oswald and Plonsky (2010). These results suggest not only that <b>corpus</b> <b>use</b> can be effective (within groups) but also efficient (between groups) compared to a range of conventional practices. It should be stressed that considerably more work is still required at all stages of this research (collecting, coding, collating, analysis, etc.). We expect to develop these and other aspects into a fully-fledged meta-analysis for the AILA seminar in 2014, describing limitations and nuancing the findings, focusing on a range of variables, contextualising our study against other meta-analyses in applied linguistics, and suggesting avenues in need of future exploration...|$|E
