40|$|Background. As {{interest}} on wearable computing [1] increases, researchers {{are looking for}} new materials {{to use as a}} support for electronics. A fabric substrate is very appealing: it is elastic and extensible [2], supported by a well known technology and produced at low-cost. State of the art. Some smart pressure-sensors interfacing with a flexible substrate have been developed, but they are either based on electro-optical fabric ([3]) which is not suitable for the low cost market, or they need expensive and cumbersome PCB electronics ([4]). Our contribution. This paper introduces an approach for decoding the pressure information exerted over a broad piece of fabric by means of capacitive sensing. The system is composed of a distributed passive array of capacitors (i. e. an array where no active elements like transistors are involved), whose capacitance varies according to the pressure exerted over a surface, as well as an electronic system that collects and computes the subsequent capacitance variations. Capacitors can be realized in different ways, though, in our demonstrator they have been implemented between rows and columns of conductive fibers patterned on the two opposite sides of an elastic synthetic foam. When the dielectric layer between a given row and <b>column</b> <b>electrodes</b> is squeezed, as a pressure is exerted over the corresponding fabric area, the coupling capacitance between the two is increased.

40|$|A microshutter array (MSA) {{has been}} {{developed}} for use as an aperture array for multi-object selections in James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) technology. Light shields, molybdenum nitride (MoN) coating on shutters, and aluminum/aluminum oxide coatings on interior walls are put on each shutter for light leak prevention, and to enhance optical contrast. Individual shutters are patterned with a torsion flexure that permits shutters to open 90 deg. with a minimized mechanical stress concentration. The shutters are actuated magnetically, latched, and addressed electrostatically. Also, micromechanical features are tailored onto individual shutters to prevent stiction. An individual shutter consists of a torsion hinge, a shutter blade, a front electrode that is coated on the shutter blade, a backside electrode that is coated on the interior walls, and a magnetic cobalt-iron coating. The magnetic coating is patterned into stripes on microshutters so that shutters can respond to an external magnetic field for the magnetic actuation. A set of <b>column</b> <b>electrodes</b> is placed on top of shutters, {{and a set of}} row electrodes on sidewalls is underneath the shutters {{so that they can be}} electrostatically latched open. A linear permanent magnet is aligned with the shutter rows and is positioned above a flipped upside-down array, and sweeps across the array in a direction parallel to shutter columns. As the magnet sweeps across the array, sequential rows of shutters are rotated from their natural horizontal orientation to a vertical open position, where they approach vertical electrodes on the sidewalls. When the electrodes are biased with a sufficient electrostatic force to overcome the mechanical restoring force of torsion bars, shutters remain latched to vertical electrodes in their open state. When the bias is removed, or is insufficient, the shutters return to their horizontal, closed positions. To release a shutter, both the electrode on the shutter and the one on the back wall where the shutter sits are grounded. The shutters with one or both ungrounded electrodes are held open. Sub-micron bumps underneath light shields and silicon ribs on back walls are the two features to prevent stiction. These features ensure that the microshutter array functions properly in mechanical motions. The MSA technology can be used primarily in multi-object imaging and spectroscopy, photomask generation, light switches, and in the stepper equipment used to make integrated circuits and MEMS (microelectromechanical systems) devices...|$|E

Numerical models were built to understand the feasibility and differences of electrochemical detection within an unpacked and packed column. From the simulated results, the surface area of the electrode was not hindered by the presence of the particles in flow condition. An electrochemical microfluidic device has been successfully fabricated on PET (polyethylene terephthalate) substrate using the reverse imprinting technique. The photolithographically produced gold metal electrode lines were imprinted into the PET substrate using a blank mould and produced an inlaid electrode array with overall step residue within 40 nm. The semi-cured thermoset polyester channel was irreversibly thermal bonded on the PET substrate. The devices were able to tolerate pressure in excess of 90 bars. The PET column was packed with 5 μm C 18 silica beads to perform reverse phase chromatography separation. The array was electrochemically characterised using standard redox probes in both stagnant conditions and under flow. Both numerical modelling and experimental data show improved sensitivity under flow and a limiting current which scaled linearly with cubic root of volume flow rate.

30|$|An {{electroencephalography}} (EEG) coherence {{network is}} {{a representation of}} functional brain connectivity, and is constructed by calculating the coherence between pairs of electrode signals {{as a function of}} frequency. Typical visualizations of coherence networks use a matrix representation with rows and <b>columns</b> representing <b>electrodes</b> and cells representing coherences between electrode signals, or a 2 D node-link diagram with vertices representing electrodes and edges representing coherences.

In this paper, a new method for data-driven visualization of multichannel EEG coherence networks is proposed to avoid the drawbacks of conventional methods. This method partitions electrodes into dense groups of spatially connected regions. It not only preserves spatial relationships between regions, but also allows an analysis of the functional connectivity within and between brain regions, which could be used to explore the relationship between functional connectivity and underlying brain structures. As an example application, the method is applied to the analysis of multichannel EEG coherence networks obtained from older and younger adults who perform a cognitive task.

This matrix was positioned on the right calf of eight subjects after identification of the MG and LG contours with ultrasound scanning. Gray-scale images were generated with the maxima and minima of the cross-correlation function between the envelope of each EMG signal and the body center of pressure (CoP) for individual forward sways. These images were automatically segmented to reduce the data set into representative and local values of EMG-CoP cross-correlation for each muscle. On average, modulations in EMG amplitude preceded the onset of forward sways with a variable timing, with both gastrocnemius muscles being similarly and synchronously modulated in 193 out of 236 sways. Variations in the timing of activation between muscles were less frequent, although consistent across subjects and significantly correlated with changes in the direction and velocity of body sways.

50|$|The {{electrodes}} on {{one side}} of the LCD are arranged in <b>columns,</b> while the <b>electrodes</b> on the other side are arranged in rows, forming a large matrix that controls every pixel. Each pixel is designated a unique row-column combination, and the pixel can be accessed by the control circuits using this combination. These circuits send charge down the appropriate row and column, effectively applying a voltage across the electrodes at a given pixel. Simple LCD’s such as those on digital watches can operate on what is called a passive-matrix structure, in which each pixel is addressed one at a time. This results in extremely slow response times and poor voltage control. A voltage applied to one pixel can cause the liquid crystals at surrounding pixels to untwist undesirably, resulting in fuzziness and poor contrast in this area of the image. LCD’s with high resolutions, such as large-screen LCD televisions, require an active-matrix structure. This structure is a matrix of thin-film transistors, each corresponding to one pixel on the display. The switching ability of the transistors allows each pixel to be accessed individually and precisely, without affecting nearby pixels. Each transistor also acts as a capacitor while leaking very little current, so it can effectively store the charge while the display is being refreshed.|$|R
