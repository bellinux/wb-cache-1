40|$|AbstractThe {{variation}} of reinforcement details, confinement and joints angle are considerable factors which affect the ultimate limit moment of joints and joints efficiency. The {{variation of}} joint size is {{another factor that}} significantly affects the ultimate limit moment of joints and frame joints efficiency. These previous factors were not considered in design. Corners may be subjected to closing moments, which subject to tensile stresses in {{the outside of the}} corner, or to opening moments, which cause tensile stresses in the inside of the corner. The last type of moments arise more detailing problems. Opening joints may be found in retaining walls water tanks, open channels, bridge abutments, high rises due to wind effect, frame structures, etc. in the other hand the <b>closing</b> <b>joint</b> may be found in two hinged and fixed frames and underground water tanks. Hence two types of joints should be compared. The presented paper introduces an experimental and analytical study in order to investigate the effect of reinforcement details, confinement, joints size, joints angle on the frame joints efficiency and comparison between closing joints and opening joints. Experimentally, a total of eleven specimens were tested under vertical load. All specimens were tested up to failure and the behaviour was fully monitored. Moreover, a nonlinear 3 D-finite element analysis was established using ABAQUS program and verified with the experimental results in order to give design recommendations for those structural elements...|$|E
40|$|Knee joints, {{the beam}} column {{connections}} {{found at the}} roof level of a moment resisting frame buildings, are inherently different from conventional interior and exterior beam column connections {{in the way that}} forces from adjoining members are transferred into joint and then resisted by the joint. A knee connection has two distinct load resisting mechanisms, each for closing and opening actions acting simultaneously under reversed cyclic loading. In spite of many distinct differences in the behaviour of shear resistance in knee joints, there are no special design provisions in the major design codes available across the world due to lack of in-depth research on the knee connections. To understand the relative importance of opening and closing actions in design, it is imperative to study knee joints under varying shear stresses, especially at higher opening-to-closing shear stress ratios. Three knee joint specimens, under different input shear stresses, were designed to produce a varying ratio of input opening to closing shear stresses. The design was carried out {{in such a way that}} the ratio of flexural strength of beams with consideration of axial forces in opening to closing actions are maintained at 0. 5, 0. 7, and 1. 0, thereby resulting in the required variation of opening to <b>closing</b> <b>joint</b> shear stress ratios among the specimens. The behaviour of these specimens was then carefully studied in terms of closing and opening capacities, hysteretic behaviour, and envelope curves to understand the differences in joint performance based on which an attempt to suggest design guidelines for knee joints is made emphasizing the relative importance of opening and closing actions. Specimens with relatively higher opening stresses were observed to be more vulnerable under the action of seismic loading...|$|E

40|$|There are {{considerable}} {{difficulties in}} describing the properties of reinforced concrete materials and their interaction. It is therefore necessary to calibrate the mathematical model by accurate testing of laboratory specimens. It can be shown that momentcurvature relationship varies {{along the length of}} a member and at beam-column joints. This behaviour depends critically on the geometry of the joint, reinforcement details and the stress-strain characteristics of concrete and steel. Tests have been carried out on model reinforced concrete portal frames and independent specimens making up the frame to predict their non-linear behaviour. The stiffness of the joint {{plays an important role in}} the response of the complete frame structure. The behaviour of the corner joints is of particular interest because both the strength and ductility differs for opening and <b>closing</b> <b>joints.</b> The loss of stiffness at joints has a significant effect on the inelastic deformations. The non-linear finite element (FE) program developed takes into account the loss of stiffness at joints and the falling branch behaviour of the material stress-strain relationships. Constant, linear, and parabolic variation in flexural rigidity (EI) and axial rigidity (EA) are taken into consideration along the element length. The combined effect of material and geometric non-linearity is considered. The FE program may use either calculated momentcurvature relationship of different elements or the experimental data obtained from tests. The results show good agreement between the theoretical and experimental beam moment-curvature relationships. Horizontally loaded frame analysis, which involves opening and <b>closing</b> <b>joints,</b> shows that ignoring the joint effect over-estimates the strength. In the case of vertically loaded frames, which involves two <b>closing</b> <b>joints,</b> ignoring the joint effects had little or no influence. The results show good agreement between the theoretical and experimental frame force-displacement relationships throughout the loading range providing the change of stiffness at joints is taken into account for horizontally loaded frames...|$|R
