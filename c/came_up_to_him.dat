25|$|Alistair Brownlee {{kept his}} perfect Grand Final record as he claimed his second ITU World Championship and 11th World Series race win. Thirty athletes headed {{out of the}} swim {{together}} and despite numerous attempts to breakaway on the bike headed in to the run section together. A chase pack led by McCormack cut the gap to 30 seconds which then grew to 45 seconds on the final bike lap. The Brownlees went into a lead by themselves on the run but the chase was never more than 10 seconds away which included Gómez, Riederer, Alexander Brukhankov, Dmitry Polyansky, David Hauss and Laurent Vidal. On lap three Alistair dropped his brother, and Riederer and Gómez <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> There Gómez dropped off the pace and finished sixth while Riederer out-kicked Jonathan for second. Gómez’s sixth place was {{enough for him to}} take bronze overall as the overall podium did not change.|$|E

2500|$|At dawn [...] {{set out to}} find , the Horned Monster. [...] He came to a broad plain at {{the foot}} of the mountains, and saw [...] lying at rest.

[...] "Truly, little brother," [...] answered Monster Slayer, [...] "you shall have it." [...] Ground Squirrel went to , saw that he was dead, and put some of his blood on his face and danced and sang. The face of every ground squirrel bears red streaks to this day. [...] And so it is that there has always been good will between Earth Surface People and the ground squirrels. [...] Gopher came and removed some of 's skin and put it on his own back. [...] So it is that the back of gophers is thickly covered to this day, and there has been harmony between Earth Surface People and gophers to this day. [...] And Gopher gave part of the monster's bowel and lung to Monster Slayer to take back as proof that [...] was slain.|$|E
