40|$|A TF 34 {{turbofan}} engine is being modified to produce shaft power from an output coupling on the fan disk when variable {{inlet guide vanes}} are closed to reduce fan airflow.

40|$|A {{variable}} {{inlet guide}} van (VIGV) type <b>convertible</b> <b>engine</b> {{that could be}} used to power future high-speed rotorcraft was tested on an outdoor stand. The engine ran stably and smoothly in the turbofan, turboshaft, and dual (combined fan and shaft) power modes. In the turbofan mode with the VIGV open fuel consumption was comparable to that of a conventional turbofan engine. In the turboshaft mode with the VIGV closed fuel consumption was higher than that of present turboshaft engines because power was wasted in churning fan-tip airflow. In dynamic performance tests with a specially built digital engine control and using a waterbrake dynamometer for shaft load, the engine responded effectively to large steps in thrust command and shaft torque. Previous mission analyses of a conceptual X-wing rotorcraft capable of 400 -knot cruise speed were revised to account for more fan-tip churning power loss than was originally estimated. The new calculations confirm that using convertible engines rather than separate lift and cruise engines would result in a smaller, lighter craft with lower fuel use and direct operating cost...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} the {{helicopter}} to function efficiently at zero flight speed is counterbalanced by a limitation to rather low forward flight speeds. An ability to fly efficiently at high speed would provide very significant improvements in rotorcraft productivity and economics.

The engine should be a shaft output engine in the vertical flight mode. In the horizontal mode, the propulsor can be fan or propeller.

40|$|Although the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) {{had been}} used since the early 20 th Century, their {{development}} has had a considerable growth during these first two decades of the 21 st Century. Among the most popular UAVs, we may find the multicopters, {{due to the fact}} they involve a considerable amount of advantages, such as their small size and manoeuvrability. However, we should keep in mind that their autonomy is generally quite small because they need a relevant quantity of energy to fly. In order to mitigate the influence of that drawback, the IMS (Intégration du Matériau au Système) laboratory that is associated with the Université de Bordeaux (France) is trying to implement <b>convertible</b> <b>engines</b> to this kind of aircraft. The idea would be to change the orientation of rotors to use the advantages of both the fixed-wing aircraft (easier cruise flights) and rotor based aircraft (vertical take-offs and landings), to maximize the benefits of both modes. The aim of that project is to implement that idea on a tricopter drone, that is to say, on a UAV that has three rotors. Two out of three rotors would remain fixed with respect to the body of it, and the third one would be movable around the roll axis. This document is about the internship that has been done at that laboratory, helping to develop that project.

Afterwards, different control laws are used in order to make a safe implementation of the previous system at a later stage. Finally, algorithms that detect the faults that may come up throughout its flights are created. That work has been made at a simulation level, that is to say, it involves the computational tasks in order to be implemented on the actual tricopter later on, using the Matlab program and its Simulink application, as they constitute really handy tools to make this kind of analysis...|$|R

40|$|The {{feasibility}} study {{has shown that}} a dump/fill type torque converter has excellent potential for the <b>convertible</b> fan/shaft <b>engine.</b> The torque converter space requirement permits internal housing within the normal flow path of a turbofan engine at acceptable engine weight. The unit permits operating the engine in the turboshaft mode by decoupling the fan. To convert to turbofan mode, the torque converter overdrive capability bring the fan speed up to the power turbine speed to permit engagement of a mechanical lockup device when the shaft speed are synchronized. The conversion to turbofan mode can be made without drop of power turbine speed in less than 10 sec. Total thrust delivered to the aircraft by the proprotor, fan, and engine during tansient can be controlled to prevent loss of air speed or altitude. Heat rejection to the oil is low, and additional oil cooling capacity is not required. The turbofan engine aerodynamic design is basically uncompromised by convertibility and allows proper fan design for quiet and efficient cruise operation. Although {{the results of the}} {{feasibility study}} are exceedingly encouraging, {{it must be noted that}} they are based on extrapolation of limited existing data on torque converters.

40|$|The AV- 95 Sun Devil must combine {{helicopter}} capabilities, such as vertical takeoff and landings (VTOL) and rotor-powered flight, {{along with}} long-duration cruise and high-speed dash capabilities unobtainable by conventional helicopters. To {{be able to}} perform both tasks, and perform them well, the AV- 95 Sun Devil design incorporates several unconventional devices; the AV- 95 uses two <b>convertible</b> turbofan <b>engines,</b> able to provide both shaft power for the main rotor and tall fan as well as jet thrust either separately or simultaneously. Other devices used for the AV- 95 include a variable diameter main rotor and a blown flap. In helicopter mode, the AV- 95 Sun Devil performs like a winged helicopter. The addition of wings to an attack helicopter results in two significant advantages. First, the addition of wings makes a helicopter more maneuverable than a wingless, but otherwise similar helicopter. Second, since the wings produce lift, rotor stall and compressibility effects can be significantly delayed at high tip velocities. In fixed-wing mode, the main rotor is completely off-loaded but slightly powered, and the rotor diameter has been minimized. The AV- 95 Sun Devil has many advantages over other VTOL aircraft. The conversion process is simple and fast; conversion does not make the AV- 95 vulnerable to enemy attack during conversion such as a tilt-wing or a tilt-rotor. Stop-rotor aircraft and a stowed rotor aircraft require heavy breaking of the rotor for conversion; this adds time for conversion and weight to the aircraft. Because the AV- 95 never stops the rotor in flight, much weight is spared, and conversion is much simpler and faster...|$|R
