For example, if one point sets a brightness level of 0.90 for a given pixel and another point calculated later barely touches that pixel and has a brightness of 0.05, the final value set for that pixel should be 0.95, not 0.05.|$|E

The chilli pods are harvested from January to May. The annual production of Byadagi Cilli is around 21,000 kg. The quality of chilli varieties is measured in terms of the extractable red colour pigment; this colour is measured in ASTA colour units. Byadagi Chilli has an ASTA <b>colour</b> <b>value</b> of 156.9. The higher the ASTA colour unit, the better the quality of chilli and therefore the higher the price. The Byadagi chilli has negligible capsaicin content making it less pungent than other chilli varieties.|$|E
50|$|In {{ray casting}} the {{geometry}} {{which has been}} modeled is parsed pixel by pixel, line by line, {{from the point of}} view outward, as if casting rays out {{from the point of view}}. Where an object is intersected, the color value at the point may be evaluated using several methods. In the simplest, the color value of the object at the point of intersection becomes the value of that pixel. The color may be determined from a texture-map. A more sophisticated method is to modify the <b>colour</b> <b>value</b> by an illumination factor, but without calculating the relationship to a simulated light source. To reduce artifacts, a number of rays in slightly different directions may be averaged.|$|E
50|$|Pixels are {{the main}} focus of the strip. They're square, genderless and monochromatic. Every pixel is of a {{different}} 24-bit colour, and there is a pixel of every colour, so there are exactly 16,777,216 of them at any given time. A pixel's first name is his <b>colour</b> <b>value</b> in hexadecimal (e.g. 0000FF), and his second name is this same value in binary (e.g.. 000000000000000011111111). Although pixels can die, they are instantly reborn as infants, usually to a parent of a similar colour. There is no pregnancy, and any pixel can give birth at any moment. Birth is painless, and merely involves an infant appearing near his parent. Infants are smaller than adult pixels, with rounded corners which quickly sharpen.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} has been {{directed}} towards investigating quantitative measurements of colours in minerals, which might serve as a readily accessible means of identification and understanding related properties. A review of the concepts of colour measurement is described {{in the first part}} of the thesis. Attention has been paid to the improvement and application of methods of colour measurement,- in mineralogy and gemmology. Computational procedures and all the necessary computer programmes for calculating <b>colour</b> <b>values</b> are given with examples. For this purpose appropriate measurements of spectral reflectivity for opaque minerals, and spectral transmittance for non-opaque minerals and facetted gemstones are described. Quantitative measurements of other colour properties - colour constancy, bireflectance and reflection pleochroism - are described and defined. A study of some colour problems in ore minerals is made. Tables of <b>colour</b> <b>values</b> and spectral reflectivity data for 130 ore minerals are given, and these values are also presented in colour diagrams. The uses of quantitative <b>colour</b> <b>values</b> and <b>colour</b> diagrams are explained with examples...|$|R

50|$|The best {{possible}} colour results can perform {{for many years}} or may begin to fade over time. The amount of time required for this, depends per person. While permanent makeup pigment remains in the dermis its beauty-span {{may be influenced by}} several possible factors. These can be environmental, procedural and/or individual factors. Sun exposure fades colour. The amount and colour of pigment deposit at the dermal level can affect the length of time that permanent makeup looks its best. Very natural-looking applications are likely to require a touch-up before more dramatic ones for this reason. Individual influences include lifestyles that find an individual in the sun regularly such as with gardening or swimming. Skin tones are a factor in <b>colour</b> <b>value</b> changes over time.|$|E
5000|$|Compositing. After all {{sampling}} points have been shaded, they are composited along the ray of sight, {{resulting in the}} final <b>colour</b> <b>value</b> for the pixel that is currently being processed. The composition is derived directly from the rendering equation and is similar to blending acetate sheets on an overhead projector. It may work back-to-front, i.e. computation starts with the sample farthest from the viewer and ends with the one nearest to the viewer. This work flow direction ensures that masked parts of the volume do not affect the resulting pixel. The front-to-back order could be more computationally efficient since, the residual ray energy is getting down while ray travels away from camera; so, the contribution to the rendering integral is diminishing therefore more aggressive speed/quality compromise may be applied (increasing of distances between samples along ray is one of such speed/quality trade-offs).|$|E
50|$|A region {{quadtree}} with a {{depth of}} n {{may be used to}} represent an image consisting of 2n × 2n pixels, where each pixel value is 0 or 1. The root node represents the entire image region. If the pixels in any region are not entirely 0s or 1s, it is subdivided. In this application, each leaf node represents a block of pixels that are all 0s or all 1s. Note the potential savings in terms of space when these trees are used for storing images; images often have many regions of considerable size that have the same <b>colour</b> <b>value</b> throughout. Rather than store a big 2-D array of every pixel in the image, a quadtree can capture the same information potentially many divisive levels higher than the pixel-resolution sized cells that we would otherwise require. The tree resolution and overall size is bounded by the pixel and image sizes.|$|E

In order to improve the detection rate, the invention foresees that in a test material containing reject parts, the <b>colour</b> <b>values</b> of the product are analyzed in several subranges by determining in each subrange a classifier for connecting areas of pixels with <b>colour</b> <b>values</b> occurring in each subrange and by performing a classification according to specified criteria consisting of the geometry and the size o f said detection areas...|$|R

5000|$|The {{relevant}} features {{gathered during}} box counting {{depend on the}} subject being investigated {{and the type of}} analysis being done. Two well-studied subjects of box counting, for instance, are binary (meaning having only two colours, usually black and white) and gray-scale digital images (i.e., jpgs, tiffs, etc.). Box counting is generally done on patterns extracted from such still images in which case the raw information recorded is typically based on features of pixels such as a predetermined <b>colour</b> <b>value</b> or range of colours or intensities. When box counting is done to determine a fractal dimension known as the box counting dimension, the information recorded is usually either yes or no {{as to whether or not}} the box contained any pixels of the predetermined colour or range (i.e., the number of boxes containing relevant pixels at each [...] is counted). For other types of analysis, the data sought may be the number of pixels that fall within the measuring box, the range or average values of colours or intensities, the spatial arrangement amongst pixels within each box, or properties such as average speed (e.g., from particle flow).|$|E
40|$|The {{environmental}} factors proximately influencing variable colouration in the bushcricket, Mygalopsis marki, were studied in natural populations and under controlled laboratory conditions.

Ground colour hue differed between natural populations in different seasons and at different localities. The proportion of brown individuals was greater in populations developing over late summer than over spring at the same locality, and in populations from drier localities, as indicated by vegetation type, in the same season. Experimental studies showed that colour change occurred at moults, with green colouration promoted by increased water intake in developing nymphs. Ground <b>colour</b> <b>value</b> and pattern differed between natural populations at different localities, but not in different seasons. Ground <b>colour</b> <b>value</b> was less, and pattern was greater, in populations from localities with a dense cover of forbs and grasses.
