50|$|Tag {{and other}} chasing games {{have been banned}} in some schools in the United Kingdom and United States due to {{concerns}} about injuries, complaints from children that {{it can lead to}} harassment and bullying, and that there is an aspect to the game that possesses an unhealthily predatory element to its nature. In 2008, a 10-year-old boy in Omaha, Nebraska died from brain injuries suffered from falling onto a metal pole while playing tag, and a school dinner lady in Dorset was left partially paralyzed after a 13-year-old boy playing tag ran into her in 2004.

40|$|Art. 7 of Regulation No. 864 / 07 (so called Rome II Regulation) {{provides}} a specific conflict-of- law rule concerning liability for environmental damage, which empowers the person seeking {{compensation for damage}} to choose the lex loci actus instead of the lex loci damni as basis {{for his or her}} claim. The paper, first, investigates the rationale for entrusting only one of the parties involved in the environmental damage (i. e. the person seeking compensation) with the right to unilaterally choose the law governing the <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> <b>damage,</b> and reaches the conclusion that the provision at issue does not only (or mainly) purport to affect the balance between the said parties, but rather aims at ensuring a high level of environmental protection, both by preventing a race {{to the bottom of the}} relevant national legal standards and by discouraging the environmental dumping. Further, the paper (i) compares the specific provision laid down by Art. 7 of Rome II Regulation with the general-conflict-of law rule provided by Art. 4, which exceptionally vests (not the person seeking compensation for damage, but) national courts with the power to derogate from the lex loci damni in principle applicable, and (ii) underlines the specific role played – in the context of environmental liability – by party autonomy, also in light of the provisions of Art. 14 of the Regulation itself. An English version of this paper is published (with shorter footnotes) in European Legal Forum, 2013, pp. 137 - 144...|$|E
