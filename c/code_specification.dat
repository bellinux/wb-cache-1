What is called Morse code today is actually somewhat different from what was originally developed by Vail and Morse. The Modern International Morse code, or continental code, was created by Friedrich Clemens Gerke in 1848 and initially used for telegraphy between Hamburg and Cuxhaven in Germany. Gerke changed {{nearly half of the}} alphabet and all of the numerals, providing the foundation for the modern form of the code. After some minor changes, International Morse Code was standardized at the International Telegraphy Congress in 1865 in Paris and was later made the standard by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Morse's original <b>code</b> <b>specification,</b> largely limited to use in the United States and Canada, became known as American Morse code or railroad code. American Morse code is now seldom used except in historical re-enactments.|$|E

TBNF goes beyond BNF and extended BNF (EBNF) grammar notation because it not only defines the syntax of a language, but also defines {{the structure of the}} abstract syntax tree (AST) to be created in memory and the output intermediate code to be generated. Thus TBNF defines the complete translation process from input text to intermediate <b>code.</b> <b>Specification</b> of the output intermediate code is optional, in which case you will still get automatic AST creation and have the ability to define its structure in the grammar.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{considers}} a domain specific methodology {{that has been}} employed to derive a cost optimized on-chip memory architecture for network protocols such as the Data Link Control layer of the HIPERLAN/ 2 protocol. The performed design flow {{was based on a}} well established methodology script which is appropriate for network protocol applications. The methodology consists of a sequence of steps that take as input the initial <b>code</b> <b>specification.</b> Initially the application’s data types are identified automatically and then the crucial ones in terms of power are optimized. Finally, for the optimized <b>code</b> <b>specification</b> the methodology exctract as output an optimized on-chip memory architecture. During the optimization process, the time constraints are also taken into account as they are crucial in wireless network protocol applications. As the experimental results show, the application of the methodology on the HIPERLAN/ 2 application reduces the power consumption up to 37 % comparing to that imposed by the initial <b>code</b> <b>specification...</b>|$|E

30|$|From an {{economic}} perspective, curtailment of PV generation {{is considered a}} last resort, which focus research on voltage regulation using reactive power control. Local control strategies utilize local measurements to decide on an appropriate power factor or reactive power set-point, and typically follow a droop-based control scheme with a defined droop ratio [1]. The definition of the droop ratio can be done through grid <b>code</b> <b>specification</b> [3, 4] or more advanced coordination-based approaches [5, 6]. Similar for all local control strategies is their ability to alleviate voltage rise issues, but also their limited capability to adjust to overall optimization since they follow a certain profile [7].|$|E

Besides, in order to conform to the advance communication standard, our decoder can also perform as a reconfigurable trellis decoder.

Its performance is comparable with the bit matrix scheduling algorithm developed by Plank, but is more intuitive and reveals the essence better. In the process, we present a new class of Liberation codes called the Latin Liberation codes. These codes are based on column-hamiltonian Latin squares, hence the name. They are superior to the Liberation codes in parameter flexibility and structure flexibility.
