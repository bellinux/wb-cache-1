Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) <b>concentrations</b> vary; peak CSF <b>concentrations</b> are lower than serum ones, due to slow diffusion across the blood–brain barrier, and trough <b>concentrations</b> in the CSF are higher for the same reason. The average half-life is three hours in children, four hours in teenagers, and five hours in adults.|$|E

5|$|Another {{possible}} {{mechanism for}} the formation of planetesimals is the streaming instability in which the drag felt by particles orbiting through gas creates a feedback effect causing the growth of local <b>concentrations.</b> These local concentration push back on the gas creating a region where the headwind felt by the particles is smaller.

40|$|Objective-To compare 4 assay {{procedures}} for prediction of passive transfer status in lambs. Animals-Thirty-one 1 -day-old Sardinian lambs. Procedure-Serum IgG <b>concentration</b> {{was determined by}} use of single radial immunodiffusion, The following were determined: serum total protein <b>concentration</b> as measured by refractometry (ie, refractometry serum total protein <b>concentration),</b> serum total protein <b>concentration</b> {{as determined by the}} biuret method (ie, biuret method serum total protein <b>concentration),</b> serum gamma-globulin <b>concentration</b> as determined by serum protein electrophoresis, and serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) activity as measured by spectrophotometry. Accuracy of these assays for estimation of serum IgG <b>concentration</b> in 1 -day-old lambs was established by use of linear regression analysis. Results-Refractometry serum total protein <b>concentration,</b> biuret method serum total protein <b>concentration,</b> and serum gamma-globulin <b>concentration</b> were closely and linearly correlated with serum IgG <b>concentration.</b> The natural logarithm (In) of serum GGT activity was closely and linearly correlated with serum IgG <b>concentration</b> (In) Refractometry serum total protein <b>concentration,</b> biuret method serum total protein <b>concentration,</b> and gamma-globulin <b>concentration</b> accounted for approximately 85 %, 91 %, and 95 % of the variation in serum IgG <b>concentration,</b> respectively. Serum GGT activity (In) accounted for approximately 92 % of the variation in serum IgG <b>concentration</b> (In). Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-For prediction of passive transfer status in 1 -day-old lambs, serum GGT activity or biuret method serum total protein <b>concentration</b> determination will allow for passive transfer monitoring program development. Immediate refractometry serum total protein <b>concentration</b> determination is beneficial in making timely management and treatment decisions.
