5|$|When first {{introduced}} {{to the rest of}} the pride, the <b>cubs</b> initially lack confidence when confronted with adult lions other than their mother. They soon begin to immerse themselves in the pride life, however, playing among themselves or attempting to initiate play with the adults. Lionesses with <b>cubs</b> of their own are more likely to be tolerant of another lioness's <b>cubs</b> than lionesses without <b>cubs.</b> The tolerance of the male lions toward the <b>cubs</b> varies – sometimes, a male will patiently let the <b>cubs</b> play with his tail or his mane, whereas another may snarl and bat the <b>cubs</b> away.|$|R
50|$|The {{station has}} the {{distinction}} of being Indiana's first Chicago <b>Cubs</b> radio affiliate. In the late 1950s, Norman Hall went to Chicago and presented the <b>Cubs</b> with thousands of signatures from listeners — doubtless diehard <b>Cubs</b> fans — who wanted to hear <b>Cubs</b> games on WBNL. <b>Cubs</b> games have been broadcast on WBNL to listeners in southwestern Indiana ever since.|$|R

5|$|Both of Coker's older {{brothers}} {{were involved in}} Scouting and Coker first became involved when he joined <b>Cub</b> Scouts in late 1951. He completed the Cubbing program and joined Troop 32. Troop 32 had about a dozen members at that time but had over 60 members when Coker made Eagle Scout in 1959. During this time the troop formed an Explorer Post and Sea Scout unit. After making Eagle Scout, Coker joined the Sea Scout unit and worked at summer camp before the joined the Navy in October 1963. When Coker returned to Linden after being released from captivity, the Scouts were his biggest supporter. Troop 32 now had over 100 members. Local citizens turned out by the hundreds to greet him. Coker visited many of the local Scouting units. Coker was then inactive in Scouting during a busy Naval career, but got involved again when his son joined <b>Cub</b> Scouts as a Tiger <b>Cub</b> after the family had settled in Virginia Beach, Virginia. He became the den leader of 7 boys, all of whom earned their Arrow of Light, the highest recognition in <b>Cub</b> Scouting. They moved on to Troop 62, Virginia Beach, in May 1994; with five of them later becoming Eagle Scouts, including his son.|$|E

5|$|Local {{influences}} {{have also}} been a strong part of Scouting. By adopting and modifying local ideologies, Scouting {{has been able to}} find acceptance {{in a wide variety of}} cultures. In the United States, Scouting uses images drawn from the U.S. frontier experience. This includes not only its selection of animal badges for <b>Cub</b> Scouts, but the underlying assumption that American native peoples are more closely connected with nature and therefore have special wilderness survival skills which can be used as part of the training program. By contrast, British Scouting makes use of imagery drawn from the Indian subcontinent, because that region was a significant focus in the early years of Scouting. Baden-Powell's personal experiences in India led him to adopt Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book as a major influence for the <b>Cub</b> Scouts; for example, the name used for the <b>Cub</b> Scout leader, Akela (whose name was also appropriated for the Webelos), is that of the leader of the wolf pack in the book.|$|E

50|$|In 2009, the Chicago <b>Cubs</b> {{expressed}} interest in creating their own regional cable network.

The only difference would be that the <b>Cubs</b> could not immediately broadcast <b>Cubs</b> games due to the existing contracts and/or ownership stakes in CSN Chicago, WGN-TV and WCIU-TV. According to Kenney, the new <b>Cubs</b> network would be like the MLB Network, but showing Cubs-only programming. Classic <b>Cubs</b> games from the past could be scheduled as well as in-depth specials. Live telecasts of the minor league affiliate Iowa <b>Cubs</b> games were also being considered (when there are no <b>Cubs</b> games scheduled or available due to contract agreements).|$|R
