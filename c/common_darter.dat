40|$|Darters {{are small}} benthic-feeding fish. I {{examined}} reasons why some darter species are rarer than others based on geographic range, habitat specificity, and local population size using the Ohio EPA database and field research. The Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index (QHEI) represented habitat quality. I examined drainage area and gradient at the landscape-scale, riparian and channel characteristics at the reach-scale, and substrate, cover, and riffle/pool characteristics at the microhabitat scale. Some rare species occur in few rivers in Ohio, but throughout a basin, while other rare species occur only in moderate-sized rivers. Most rare species occur at {{only a few}} sites with low abundance. <b>Common</b> <b>darters</b> occurred in all-sized rivers and gradients. Rare darters occurred in large drainage areas with moderate gradients. Species richness {{was positively correlated with}} high QHEI, although the <b>common</b> johnny <b>darter</b> was abundant at sites with low QHEI. Mesohabitat and microhabitat were examined for each darter species within the species-rich Scioto River and Muskingum River basins. Rare species were more associated with high quality habitat than common species. Within Battelle-Darby Creek Metropark, a site with good habitat quality, species distributions differed. Overall, watershed size was the best predictor for a darter 2 ̆ 7 s distribution...|$|R

50|$|Not much {{information}} is available on management and conservation of the banded darter. Since the banded darter is one of North America's most <b>common</b> <b>darters,</b> the species is not listed on the federal endangered list. Mainly, the only agencies working on conservation for the darter are state agencies. The banded darter is protected in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee and North Carolina. Some ideas for management of the banded darter are to stop building dams and stop pollution of streams they inhabit. The banded darter is sensitive to siltation and pollution, and dams are thought to limit its distribution. The banded darter will also be affected by run-off from surrounding lands of the river or stream they inhabit. Michigan state agencies are managing the darter by monitoring habitat and water chemistry. If a dam is built in a river the banded darter inhabits, the dam would be destruction to the habitat.|$|R
50|$|As well as Australasian <b>darter,</b> <b>common</b> names {{given to}} the species include darter, diver, needle-beak shag, shag, and snake-bird. The {{indigenous}} people of southwestern Australia called it mimal. Gold also called it the New Holland darter or New Holland devil-bird.|$|R
50|$|The {{banded darter}} {{is one of}} the most <b>common</b> <b>darters</b> in North America, where an {{estimated}} 250 species of darters occur. The banded darter has a widespread distribution throughout much of eastern United States, primarily the Mississippi Basin. It ranges from the Verdigris River in Kansas eastward to the Allegheny River in New York and from the Minnesota River in Minnesota southward to the Ouachita River in Arkansas and the Tennessee River in Alabama. The banded darter can also be found in the headwaters of the Savannah River, in drainages of Lake Michigan, in the Duck River, and other streams across eastern United States. The species has been introduced in a few non-native streams. Its most distinguishable introduction has occurred in the Susquehanna River drainage. Specimens of the banded darter and the native darter, Etheostoma olmstedi (tessellated darter), were collected at Catatonk Creek in New York beginning in the 1960s. Biologists have studied the two darters and their niches in the Susquehanna River drainage. They found the banded darter was outcompeting the tessellated darter for habitat and resources. The buccal cavity length of the tessellated darter has increased since the banded darter was introduced to the watershed, which is expected to result in higher suction feeding performance measured as volumetric flow rate of water through the mouth. The morphological change in the tessellated darter was likely caused from the banded darter taking over the niche of the tessellated darter.|$|R

50|$|The stone darter {{is found}} within the lower Cumberland River drainage, Southern Kentucky, and North-Central Tennessee. Specimens have been {{collected}} in Todd County and Logan County in Kentucky and in the West Fork Stones River in Tennessee. Since the fish {{is found in the}} west fork of Stones River, it was given the <b>common</b> name stone <b>darter.</b> Collections were also made in Whites Creek, Marrowbone Creek, Sycamore Creek, Louise Creek, Harpeth River, and Red River. It is native to these waters and is found year round. The distribution is very small because this species has only just been recognized as a divergent species from Etheostoma virgatum in the past 10 years. The stone darter inhabits shallow pools, the bases and margins of riffles, and/or the margins of rocky bands over gravel and sand with slab rocks present. Within the Cumberland River system, species in the subgenus Catonotus are separated and live in one-species segments which create an almost totally nonoverlapping mosaic in the Cumberland, Tennessee, and Green River systems.|$|R

50|$|The rainbow darter is a small, benthic {{freshwater}} fish {{found in many}} creeks and small to medium-sized rivers throughout North America. In particular, it is common throughout the eastern United States, specifically throughout the Great Lakes and Ohio River Valley regions. Its distribution extends south to northern parts of Alabama and as far west as Missouri and Arkansas. This distribution has been suggested {{to be due to}} once existing glaciers and to its intolerance of brackish water. One study to examine the phylogeography of E. caeruleum and its colonization patterns found its distribution is greatly due to historic glaciations, and furthermore, due to distributions from drainages which have since then resulted in the current morphological diversity of the rainbow darter. Geographically, the rainbow darter {{is one of the most}} abundant and <b>common</b> <b>Darter</b> species. Current distribution shown may be outdated and should be verifies with state agencies. Particularly Texas where the species exists in limited number.|$|E
50|$|This fish, {{like most}} other darter species, tends to inhabit clear, rocky riffles of streams, creeks, and small rivers. Both {{currently}} and historically, this fish is known from only the Tennessee and Cumberland River drainages in Tennessee, Virginia, Kentucky, Alabama, North Carolina, Georgia, and Mississippi. The average length for this fish is 6.9 cm, with a maximum recorded length of 8.4 cm. The maximum recorded life span in the wild for this species is four years. The redline darter feeds mainly on aquatic macroinvertebrates, including midge fly, black fly, and caddisfly larvae, as well as water mites and mayfly nymphs. These fish spawn {{in the spring and}} early summer, from May through August. Females reportedly lay between 21 and 131 eggs, which are fertilized by the male and buried in the substrate. Males then guard the nest until the eggs hatch. Redline darters are among the most <b>common</b> <b>darter</b> species throughout much of their range, so do not require any specialized management. These darters do benefit, however, from management activities that promote healthy streams and a diversity of other darter species because of similar habitat requirements. Due to feeding and reproduction habits, these fish require flowing water, meaning that damming of creeks or streams by humans or beavers could result in extirpation of this species from those water bodies. Also, because this species needs clear water to feed, siltation and pollution that increase turbidity are detrimental to it.|$|E
50|$|Currently, {{no special}} {{programs}} or policies {{are put into}} place specifically to manage for the redline darter. Unlike several other darter species, this species is not threatened, and {{is believed to be}} one of the most <b>common</b> species of <b>darter</b> throughout its range, with a population perhaps over 1,000,000 individuals. Many state and federal agencies, such as US Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Park Service, the US Forest Service, the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, and the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission, currently engage in stream monitoring activities aimed toward improving stream health and surveying populations of fishes. Although these programs do not specifically focus on management of the redline darter, population data on this species and many other species are collected, thus helping to avoid future population problems. Also, in an effort to curb siltation and pollution that have historically been an issue for many stream-dwelling fish, many states have begun to pass laws and to educate landowners on the prevention of siltation. Increased pollution and siltation can result in higher water turbidity, making it difficult for this darter, and many other fish species, to forage for food, breed, and potentially decreasing the ability to avoid predators.|$|R
40|$|Dragonflies and damselflies (Odonata) are {{important}} prey for many small falcons, {{and the recent}} expansion of the breeding range of the Hobby into eastern England {{has been associated with}} an increased availability of dragonfly prey to juveniles. We have therefore measured the energy content and elemental composition of a range of common British dragonflies. Carbon and nitrogen contents were typical of aquatic invertebrates and did not vary with dragonfly size, whereas ash content was significantly reduced in larger species. The mean energy content of dragonfly tissue was 24. 6 kJ/g (dry mass) and showed no significant variation between species. The energy content of an individual dragonfly ranged from 0. 8 to 9. 4 kJ for the species examined in this study. Data on the energy requirements of free-living falcons suggest that a juvenile Hobby in late summer could meet its daily energy requirement by capturing between 75 and 90 Migrant Hawker or 200 to 250 <b>Common</b> <b>Darter</b> dragonflies each day...|$|E
40|$|Since Charles Darwin's initial {{observations}} and hypotheses, {{the evolution of}} elaborate male coloration in sexually dichromatic species {{has been the subject}} of great interest. Of particular recent interest is how sexual and ecological selection interact to shape variation in male coloration between closely-related species. Using darters (Percidae: Etheostomatinae), a group of fishes that vary in male coloration as a model system, my goal is to determine how sexual and ecological selection interact to shape variation in male coloration between as well as within species lineages. In Chapter 1, I used reflectance spectrophotometry to examine correlations between spectral properties of orange and blue pigmentation in the rainbow darter, Etheostoma caeruleum, with parasite load and observed a correlation between the chroma of orange bars with parasite counts. In Chapter 2, I quantified color preferences in the darter genus Etheostoma to determine if the strengths of attraction to different colors coincided with variation in male coloration between species. The females of most achromatic species exhibited no significant color preferences, while chromatic species varied in preferences, with a positive association between the presence of red or orange on the flanks and preference for red detected across all species. In Chapter 3 I utilized phylogenetic comparative approaches and a laboratory experiment of predator color preferences to quantify the role of ecological variables in shaping variation in male coloration in darters. Compared to achromatic species, chromatic darters tend to inhabit environments where predation risk would be lower; specifically, shallower, faster-flowing upland streams with a lower number of overlapping predatory species. Additionally, a <b>common</b> <b>darter</b> predator, largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), exhibited significant preferences for red stimuli in a color choice experiment. Finally, in Chapter 4 I investigated color and size correlations, as well as male and female preferences for different sized and colored mates, in the Roanoke darter, Percina roanoka. Using digital photography I found correlations between size and color, but no preferences for larger or more colorful mates were observed in either sex. The results of this dissertation suggest that sexual and ecological selection do interact to shape color variation between darter species...|$|E
