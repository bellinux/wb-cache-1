40|$|Respiratory muscle {{endurance}} training (RMET) {{can improve}} respiratory muscle endurance {{as well as}} cycling and swimming endurance. Whether these improvements are caused by reduced perception of adverse respiratory sensations and/or a change in ventilatory output remains unclear. We re-analysed nine (five randomized controlled) RMET studies performed in our laboratory. One hundred and thirty-five healthy subjects completed either RMET [i. e. an average of 12. 4 +/- 4. 9 h (median 10; range 10 - 25) of normocapnic hyperpnoea at 60 - 85 % of maximal voluntary ventilation achieved during 27 +/- 11 sessions (median 20; range 20 - 50) of 29 +/- 4 min (median 30; range 15 - 30) duration over 6. 5 +/- 4. 2 weeks (median 4; range 4 - 15), n= 90] or no RMET (CON, n= 45). Before and after RMET/CON, respiratory (approximately 70 % MVV) and cycling (70 - 85 % maximal power) endurance were tested. RMET increased both respiratory and <b>cycling</b> <b>endurance,</b> reduced perception of breathlessness and respiratory exertion during volitional and exercise-induced hyperpnoea, and slightly increased ventilation at identical workloads. Decreased respiratory sensations did not correlate with improved <b>cycling</b> <b>endurance.</b> Changes in ventilation correlated with changes in <b>cycling</b> <b>endurance</b> in both groups. We conclude that reduced adverse respiratory sensations after RMET are unlikely to cause the improvements in <b>cycling</b> <b>endurance,</b> {{that the level of}} ventilation seems to affect <b>cycling</b> <b>endurance</b> and that additional factors must contribute to the improvements in <b>cycling</b> <b>endurance</b> after RMET...|$|E

Analysis of MOSFET sub-threshold characteristics indicate cycling degradation to be {{a manifestation of}} interface state (D{sub it}) generation at the tunnel oxide/silicon interface.

Additionally, if the capping oxide is formed by steam oxidation, rather than by deposition, SONOS stacks prepared with non-nitrided tunnel oxides exhibit endurance characteristics similar to stacks with nitrided tunnel oxides.

40|$|Transition metal-oxide {{resistive}} {{random access}} memory devices have demonstrated excellent performance in switching speed, versatility of switching and low-power operation. However, this technology still faces challenges like poor <b>cycling</b> <b>endurance,</b> degradation due to high electroforming (EF) switching voltages and low yields. Approaches such as engineering of the active layer by doping or addition of thin oxide buffer layers have been often adopted to tackle these problems. Here, we have followed a strategy that combines the two; we have used ultra-thin Al 2 O 3 –y buffer layers incorporated between TiO 2 –x thin films taking into account both 3 þ/ 4 þ oxidation states of Al/Ti cations. Our devices were tested by DC and pulsed voltage sweeping and in both cases demonstrated improved switching voltages.

Here, a flexible data-refresh methodology is proposed based on timestamps and approximations of the Arrhenius-curves em- ployed to describe the temperature impact on Flash data reten- tion. The proposed approximations can be easily implemented with the help of a processor-based solution or a proposed small module called A-timer. For an asymmetric temperature distri- bution between 30 °C and 70 °C, it is estimated that the refresh frequency can be reduced by more than 50 × and almost 3 × for failure mechanisms with activation energies of 1. 1 eV and 0. 3 eV, respectively...|$|E

40|$|Respiratory {{muscle fatigue}} {{develops}} during exhaustive exercise and can limit exercise performance. Respiratory muscle training, in turn, can increase exercise performance. We investigated whether respiratory muscle endurance training (RMT) reduces exercise-induced inspiratory and expiratory muscle fatigue. Twenty-one healthy, male volunteers performed twenty 30 -min sessions of either normocapnic hyperpnoea (n = 13) or sham training (CON, n = 8) over 4 - 5 wk. Before and after training, subjects performed a constant-load cycling test at 85 % maximal power output to exhaustion (PRE(EXH), POST(EXH)). A further posttraining test was {{stopped at the}} pretraining duration (POST(ISO)) i. e., isotime. Before and after cycling, transdiaphragmatic pressure was measured during cervical magnetic stimulation to assess diaphragm contractility, and gastric pressure was measured during thoracic magnetic stimulation to assess abdominal muscle contractility. Overall, RMT did not reduce respiratory muscle fatigue. However, in subjects who developed > 10 % of diaphragm or abdominal muscle fatigue in PRE(EXH), fatigue was significantly reduced after RMT in POST(ISO) (inspiratory: - 17 +/- 6 % vs. - 9 +/- 10 %, P = 0. 038, n = 9; abdominal: - 19 +/- 10 % vs. - 11 +/- 11 %, P = 0. 038, n = 9), while sham training had no significant effect. Similarly, <b>cycling</b> <b>endurance</b> in POST(EXH) did not improve after RMT (P = 0. 071), while a significant improvement {{was seen in the}} subgroup with > 10 % of diaphragm fatigue after PRE(EXH) (P = 0. 017), but not in the sham training group (P = 0. 674). However, changes in <b>cycling</b> <b>endurance</b> did not correlate with changes in respiratory muscle fatigue. In conclusion, RMT decreased the development of respiratory muscle fatigue during intensive exercise, but this change did not seem to improve <b>cycling</b> <b>endurance...</b>|$|E

Ten well-trained male cyclists (mean +/- SD: 32. 9 +/- 7. 5 years, 74. 7 +/- 5. 3 kg, 176. 8 +/- 5. 1 cm, VO 2 peak = 59. 8 +/- 3. 5 ml center dot kg(- 1) center dot min- 1) completed two experimental time-trials following 24 hr of dietary and exercise standardization. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design was employed whereby cyclists completed a time-trial in the fastest time possible, which was equivalent work to cycling at 75 % of peak aerobic power output for 60 min. Cyclists were administered 25 ml mouth-rinses for 10 s containing either placebo or 35 mg of anhydrous caffeine eight times throughout the time-trial. Perceptual and physiological variables were recorded throughout. No significant improvement in time-trial performance was observed with caffeine (3918 +/- 243 s) compared with placebo mouth-rinse (3940 +/- 227 s). No elevation in plasma caffeine was detected due to the mouth-rinse conditions.
