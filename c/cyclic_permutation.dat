25|$|Cartwright et al. {{consider}} {{actions on}} buildings that are simply transitive on vertices. Each such action produces a bijection (or modified duality) between the points x and lines x* in the flag complex of a finite projective plane {{and a collection}} of oriented triangles of points (x,y,z), invariant under <b>cyclic</b> <b>permutation,</b> such that x lies on z*, y lies on x* and z lies on y* and any two points uniquely determine the third. The groups produced have generators x, labelled by points, and relations xyz = 1 for each triangle. Generically this construction will not correspond to an action on a classical affine building.|$|E
25|$|Meandric systems {{give rise}} to meandric permutations, a special subset of {{alternate}} permutations. An alternate permutation of the set {1, 2, …, 2n} is a <b>cyclic</b> <b>permutation</b> (with no fixed points) such that the digits in the cyclic notation form alternate between odd and even integers. Meandric permutations are useful {{in the analysis of}} RNA secondary structure. Not all alternate permutations are meandric. A modification of Heap's algorithm has been used to generate all alternate permutations of order n (that is, of length 2n) without generating all (2n)! permutations. Generation of these alternate permutations is needed before they are analyzed to determine if they are meandric or not.|$|E
