5|$|<b>Carbon</b> <b>black</b> {{is used as}} {{the black}} pigment in {{printing}} ink, artist's oil paint and water colours, carbon paper, automotive finishes, India ink and laser printer toner. <b>Carbon</b> <b>black</b> is also used as a filler in rubber products such as tyres and in plastic compounds. Activated charcoal is used as an absorbent and adsorbent in filter material in applications as diverse as gas masks, water purification, and kitchen extractor hoods, and in medicine to absorb toxins, poisons, or gases from the digestive system. Carbon is used in chemical reduction at high temperatures. Coke is used to reduce iron ore into iron (smelting). Case hardening of steel is achieved by heating finished steel components in carbon powder. Carbides of silicon, tungsten, boron and titanium, are among the hardest known materials, and are used as abrasives in cutting and grinding tools. Carbon compounds make {{up most of the}} materials used in clothing, such as natural and synthetic textiles and leather, and almost all of the interior surfaces in the built environment other than glass, stone and metal.|$|E

5|$|Pure carbon has {{extremely}} low toxicity to humans {{and can be}} handled and even ingested safely {{in the form of}} graphite or charcoal. It is resistant to dissolution or chemical attack, even in the acidic contents of the digestive tract. Consequently, once it enters into the body's tissues it is likely to remain there indefinitely. <b>Carbon</b> <b>black</b> {{was probably one of the}} first pigments to be used for tattooing, and Ötzi the Iceman was found to have carbon tattoos that survived during his life and for 5200years after his death. Inhalation of coal dust or soot (<b>carbon</b> <b>black)</b> in large quantities can be dangerous, irritating lung tissues and causing the congestive lung disease, coalworker's pneumoconiosis. Diamond dust used as an abrasive can be harmful if ingested or inhaled. Microparticles of carbon are produced in diesel engine exhaust fumes, and may accumulate in the lungs. In these examples, the harm may result from contaminants (e.g., organic chemicals, heavy metals) rather than from the carbon itself.|$|E

5|$|The restorers {{took for}} granted {{that all of the}} layers of grease and soot on the ceiling were the result of candle smoke.

5|$|On {{some of the}} figures, however, {{there still}} remains clear {{evidence}} of painting in <b>carbon</b> <b>black.</b> The apparent explanation {{for this is that}} over the long period that Michelangelo was at work, he probably, for a variety of reasons, varied his technique. Things that might affect the degree of finish achieved on a particular giornata include the heat and humidity of the day and the length of daylight hours. Whatever the reason for the difference is, a difference in approach to the light and shade on the individual figures is clearly apparent.|$|E
5|$|Shoe polish {{consists}} of a waxy colloidal emulsion, a substance composed {{of a number of}} partially immiscible liquids and solids mixed together. It is usually made from ingredients including some or all of naphtha, lanolin, turpentine, wax (often Carnauba wax), gum arabic, ethylene glycol, and if required a colourant, such as <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> or an azo dye (such as aniline yellow). It typically has a specific gravity of 0.8, is negligibly soluble in water, and is made of between 65 and 77% volatile substances—usually naphtha. The high amount of volatile substances means that the shoe polish will dry out and harden after application, while retaining its shine.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} other Black Paintings, Goya began with a black {{background}} which he painted over with lighter pigments, then with broad, heavy brushstrokes of grey, blue and brown. The darker areas were achieved by leaving the black under-paint exposed; this is most obvious in {{the figure of the}} Devil. Like the other works in the series, Witches' Sabbath is worked up through heavy, slashing brushstrokes. The plaster was underlaid with thick <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> before the paint was applied in hues of white lead, Prussian blue, vermilion of mercury, and crystals of powdered glass, orpiment and iron oxides. He likely worked with mixed materials. Technical analysis indicates that most of the Black Paintings begun with preparatory drawings. Witches' Sabbath is the exception; the final composition seems to have been painted directly onto the wall.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian {{literature}} was produced {{on a variety}} of media. Along with the chisel, necessary for making inscriptions on stone, the chief writing tool of ancient Egypt was the reed pen, a reed fashioned into a stem with a bruised, brush-like end. With pigments of <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> and red ochre, the reed pen was used to write on scrolls of papyrus—a thin material made from beating together strips of pith from the Cyperus papyrus plant—as well as on small ceramic or limestone ostraca known as potsherds. It is thought that papyrus rolls were moderately expensive commercial items, since many are palimpsests, manuscripts that have their original contents erased to make room for new written works. This, alongside tearing off pieces of papyrus documents to make smaller letters, suggests that there were seasonal shortages caused by the limited growing season of Cyperus papyrus. It also explains the frequent use of ostraca and limestone flakes as writing media for shorter written works. In addition to stone, ceramic ostraca, and papyrus, writing media also included wood, ivory, and plaster.|$|E

40|$|<b>Black</b> <b>carbon</b> {{aerosols}} absorb {{solar radiation}} and decrease planetary albedo, {{and thus can}} contribute to climate warming. In this paper, the dependence of equilibrium climate response on the altitude of <b>black</b> <b>carbon</b> is explored using an atmospheric general circulation model coupled to a mixed layer ocean model. The simulations model aerosol direct and semi-direct effects, but not indirect effects. Aerosol concentrations are prescribed and not interactive. It is shown that climate response of <b>black</b> <b>carbon</b> is highly dependent on the altitude of the aerosol. As the altitude of <b>black</b> <b>carbon</b> increases, surface temperatures decrease; <b>black</b> <b>carbon</b> near the surface causes surface warming, whereas <b>black</b> <b>carbon</b> near the tropopause and in the stratosphere causes surface cooling. This cooling occurs despite increasing planetary absorption of sunlight (i. e. decreasing planetary albedo). We find that the trend in surface air temperature response versus the altitude of <b>black</b> <b>carbon</b> is consistent with our calculations of radiative forcing after the troposphere, stratosphere, and land surface have undergone rapid adjustment, calculated as ``regressed'' radiative forcing. The variation in climate response from <b>black</b> <b>carbon</b> at different altitudes occurs largely from different fast climate responses; temperature dependent feedbacks are not statistically distinguishable. Impacts of <b>black</b> <b>carbon</b> at various altitudes on the hydrological cycle are also discussed; <b>black</b> <b>carbon</b> in the lowest atmospheric layer increases precipitation despite reductions in solar radiation reaching the surface, whereas <b>black</b> <b>carbon</b> at higher altitudes decreases precipitation...|$|R
40|$|<b>Black</b> <b>carbon</b> in sea ice will {{decrease}} sea ice surface albedo through increased absorption of incident solar radiation, exacerbating sea ice melting. Previous literature has reported different albedo responses to additions of <b>black</b> <b>carbon</b> in sea ice {{and has not}} considered how a snow cover may mitigate the effect of <b>black</b> <b>carbon</b> in sea ice. Sea ice is predominately snow covered. Visible light absorption and light scattering coefficients are calculated for a typical first year and multi-year sea ice and "dry" and "wet" snow types that suggest <b>black</b> <b>carbon</b> is the dominating absorbing impurity. The albedo response of first year and multi-year sea ice to increasing <b>black</b> <b>carbon,</b> from 1 – 1024 ng g − 1, in a top 5 cm layer of a 155 cm thick sea ice was calculated using the radiative transfer model: TUV-snow. Sea ice albedo is surprisingly unresponsive to <b>black</b> <b>carbon</b> additions up to 100 ng g − 1 with a decrease in albedo to 98. 7 % of the original albedo value due to an addition of 8 ng g − 1 of <b>black</b> <b>carbon</b> in first year sea ice compared to an albedo decrease to 99. 6 % for the same <b>black</b> <b>carbon</b> mass ratio increase in multi-year sea ice. The first year sea ice proved more responsive to <b>black</b> <b>carbon</b> additions than the multi-year ice. Comparison with previous modelling of <b>black</b> <b>carbon</b> in sea ice suggests a more scattering sea ice environment will be less responsive to <b>black</b> <b>carbon</b> additions. Snow layers on sea ice may mitigate the effects of <b>black</b> <b>carbon</b> in sea ice. "Wet" and "dry" snow layers of 0. 5, 1, 2, 5 and 10 cm were added onto the sea ice surface and the snow surface albedo calculated with the same increase in <b>black</b> <b>carbon</b> in the underlying sea ice. Just a 0. 5 cm layer of snow greatly diminishes the effect of <b>black</b> <b>carbon</b> on surface albedo, and a 2 – 5 cm layer (less than half the e -folding depth of snow) is enough to "mask" any change in surface albedo owing to additional <b>black</b> <b>carbon</b> in sea ice, but not thick enough to ignore the underlying sea ice...|$|R
