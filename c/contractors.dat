5000|$|An {{agreement}} between a chain and a <b>contractor.</b> The chain is bound within the <b>contractor</b> {{and can be}} called out at will. In return, the <b>contractor</b> provides passage for the chain out of the Abyss. Blood Seal contracts, that were made possible by Pandora, granted the ability never to age the <b>Contractor.</b> In illegal contracts, a clock-like seal appears somewhere on the <b>Contractor's</b> body, over their heart. Each time the chain's powers are drawn, the hand in the seal moves like on a clock. If a contract between the chain and <b>contractor</b> becomes void it will kill the <b>contractor.</b> Once the hand makes one full rotation, both the <b>contractor</b> and the chain are dragged into the deepest level of the Abyss. Only Baskervilles are capable of forming a genuine legal contract, in which a seal similar to an illegal contract appears, except without the hand - thus allowing a <b>contractor</b> safe and complete access {{to the power of}} their chain.|$|R
40|$|Post-frame {{buildings}} have been {{popular in the}} agricultural community for over fifty years. However, many agricultural producers {{do not have the}} resources to design and construct post-frame buildings and should rely on a <b>contractor</b> to do this work for them. The challenge for the producer is to select a <b>contractor</b> who will incorporate adequate materials with well-engineered designs to construct a structurally sound and functional building. Lack of an sufficient building design may result in a post-frame structure that looks structurally sound, but has an unacceptable risk for failure or that may not be suitable for the intended purpose. Selecting a good post-frame <b>contractor</b> may seem overwhelming at first. Many variables including price, quality of workmanship, and scheduling must be considered before choosing the <b>contractor.</b> This publication provides guidelines to help make the <b>contractor</b> selection process easier. Reputation And References Employ a <b>contractor</b> with an established business in the area. Local firms are compelled to perform satisfactory work for their businesses to survive. The <b>contractor</b> should not hesitate to provide references from past customers in your locality. Ask these references specific questions such as: • Were you pleased with the quality of the <b>contractor’s</b> work? • Did the <b>contractor</b> begin work on time? • Was the job completed on schedule? • Was the job site kept neat? • Was the job completed within budget? • Did the <b>contractor</b> fulfill all terms of your agreement? • Did the <b>contractor</b> stay in touch with you throughout the project? • Would you use this <b>contractor</b> again without hesitation? Look at finished projects similar to yours to better assess the <b>contractor’s</b> ability to deliver a worthy project on time and within budget. Be sure to review the quality of work performed by the <b>contractor.</b> Do not use a <b>contractor</b> whose quality of work is unsatisfactory...|$|R

The status of the tunnel as mixed-use created tension and deadlock between Hylan, Delaney and the New York State Transit Commission; the latter emphasized passenger service for the tunnel. After an investigation issued by Governor Al Smith, planners eliminated freight service from the plan, as per the Nicoll-Hofstadter Act signed into law by the governor; this then led to lack of interest from <b>contractors.</b>|$|E
