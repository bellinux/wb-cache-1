40|$|We study {{correlations}} in temporal {{networks and}} introduce {{the notion of}} betweenness preference. It allows to quantify to what extent paths, existing in time-aggregated represen-tations of temporal networks, are actually realizable based on the sequence of interactions. We show that betweenness preference is present in empirical temporal network data and that it influences the length of shortest time-respecting paths. Using four different data sets, we further argue that neglecting betweenness preference leads to wrong conclusions about dynamical processes on temporal networks. Recent works have argued that properties of dynamical processes evolving on complex networks change profoundly when {{the dynamics of the}} network topology is taken into account. For a num-ber of empirical temporal networks obtained from time-stamped contact data, simulations have shown that their topological dynamics can both slow down [5, 1, 6] or speed up spreading pro-cesses [17]. At the same time, it has been observed that, compared to time-aggregated topologies, the exploration dynamics of random walks in temporal networks is significantly slower [18]. Fur-thermore, {{it has been shown that}} network dynamics alone can give rise to <b>collective</b> <b>phenomen...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceSpontaneous {{collective}} motion, as in some {{flocks of}} bird and schools of fish, {{is an example}} of an emergent phenomenon. Such phenomena are at present of great interest and physicists have put forward a number of theoretical results that so far lack experimental verification. In animal behaviour studies, large-scale data collection is now technologically possible, but data are still scarce and arise from observations rather than controlled experiments. Multicellular biological systems, such as bacterial colonies or tissues, allow more control, but may have many hidden variables and interactions, hindering proper tests of theoretical ideas. However, in systems on the subcellular scale such tests may be possible, particularly in in vitro experiments with only few purified components. Motility assays, in which protein filaments are driven by molecular motors grafted to a substrate in the presence of ATP, can show collective motion for high densities of motors and attached filaments. This was demonstrated recently for the actomyosin system, but a complete understanding of the mechanisms at work is still lacking. Here we report experiments in which microtubules are propelled by surface-bound dyneins. In this system it is possible to study the local interaction: we find that colliding microtubules align with each other with high probability. At high densities, this alignment results in self-organization of the microtubules, which are on average 15 [*]µm long, into vortices with diameters of around 400 [*]µm. Inside the vortices, the microtubules circulate both clockwise and anticlockwise. On longer timescales, the vortices form a lattice structure. The emergence of these structures, as verified by a mathematical model, {{is the result of the}} smooth, reptation-like motion of single microtubules in combination with local interactions (the nematic alignment due to collisions) [...] there is no need for long-range interactions. Apart from its potential relevance to cortical arrays in plant cells and other biological situations, our study provides evidence for the existence of previously unsuspected universality classes of <b>collective</b> motion <b>phenomen...</b>|$|R
