50|$|Daedalus {{would be}} {{constructed}} in Earth orbit {{and have an}} initial mass of 54,000 tonnes including 50,000 tonnes of fuel and 500 tonnes of scientific payload. Daedalus {{was to be a}} two-stage spacecraft. The first stage would operate for two years, taking the spacecraft to 7.1% of light speed (0.071 c), and then after it was jettisoned, the second stage would fire for 1.8 years, taking the spacecraft up to about 12% of light speed (0.12 c), before being shut down for a 46-year <b>cruise</b> <b>period.</b> Due to the extreme temperature range of operation required, from near absolute zero to 1600 K, the engine bells and support structure would be made of molybdenum alloyed with Titanium, Zirconium and Carbon, which retains strength even at cryogenic temperatures. A major stimulus for the project was Friedwardt Winterberg's inertial confinement fusion drive concept, for which he received the Hermann Oberth gold medal award.|$|E
50|$|The launch {{was planned}} for 19 April 2004 at Vandenberg Air Force Base but was {{scrubbed}} within 5 {{minutes of the}} scheduled launch window due to changing winds in the upper atmosphere. An unusual feature of the mission is that it only had a one-second launch window due to the precise orbit required by the experiment. On 20 April, at 9:57:23 AM PDT (16:57:23 UTC) the spacecraft was launched successfully. The satellite was placed in orbit at 11:12:33 AM (18:12:33 UTC) after a <b>cruise</b> <b>period</b> over the south pole and a short second burn. The mission lasted 16 months. Some preliminary results were presented at a special session during the American Physical Society meeting in April 2007. NASA initially requested a proposal for extending the GP-B data analysis phase through December 2007. The data analysis phase was further extended to September 2008 using funding from Richard Fairbank, Stanford and NASA, and beyond that point using non-NASA funding only. Final science results were reported in 2011.|$|E

40|$|Representative driving cycles {{across the}} Perth, Western Australia, {{metropolitan}} region illustrate {{a direct relationship}} to urban land use. Movement away from the central business district results in fewer traffic events, higher speeds, longer <b>cruise</b> <b>periods</b> and shorter stops.

50|$|Another {{method for}} {{reducing}} DSN burdens is the Beacon Monitor experiment. During the long <b>cruise</b> <b>periods</b> of the mission, spacecraft operations are essentially suspended. Instead of data, the craft emits a carrier signal on a predetermined frequency. Without data decoding, the carrier {{can be detected}} by much simpler ground antennas and receivers. If the spacecraft detects an anomaly, it changes the carrier between four tones, based on urgency. Ground receivers then signal operators to divert DSN resources. This prevents skilled operators and expensive hardware from babysitting an unburdened mission operating nominally. A similar system is used on the New Horizons Pluto probe {{to keep costs down}} during its ten-year cruise from Jupiter to Pluto.|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} is presented {{of the performance}} of a conceptual propulsion system in which liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen are first vaporized and heated by thermal power from a spacecraft nuclear electric power supply prior to combustion in a rocket engine. Calculations of the specific impulse (I-sp) are presented for a series of O 2 /H 2 oxidizer-to-fuel mixture ratios and reactant pre-heat temperatures (T-aug). It is found that the ratio of the augmentation power to the total engine jet power (P-aug/P-tot) determines the engine thrust for a given P-aug, T-aug, and I-sp. In addition, the performance of an unaugmented O 2 /H 2 and a heated-hydrogen rocket engine were also calculated for the same conditions. Results show that an augmented O 2 /H 2 engine has three to eight times the thrust of a heated H 2 engine for a given P-aug. It is concluded that {{it should be possible to}} design a high/low thrust propulsion system using a common propellant, with the option of using thermal power from the nuclear electric power supply to augment the low-thrust propulsion system during <b>cruise</b> <b>periods</b> when the reactor's full electric power is not needed...|$|R

The Assembly, Test, and Launch Operations (ATLO) program for these missions presented unique technical and schedule challenges to the team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).

40|$|Heavy haul trains up {{to several}} {{kilometers}} long, as illustrated in Fig. 1, are widely used to transport minerals in South Africa. The cost of train scheduling and human resources can be reduced when long and heavy haul trains are used instead of short trains. Energy consumption, running time, and in-train forces are the main concerns relating to the control of long heavy haul trains [1]. Braking control is a fundamental issue in heavy haul train operations when in-train forces and safe operation are considered. As an improvement of the older pneumatic braking systems, electrically controlled pneumatic braking systems developed in the 1990 s provide various benefits, for instance, instantaneous response to the engineer’s commands on all vehicles, graduated release of brakes, and continual replenishment of braking air reservoirs [2]. To improve the operational performance of heavy haul trains, energy-saving entails speed-switching or distance-switching algorithms, where the operation of a train consists of periods of powering, coasting, and stopping [3], [4]. The algorithms {{are based on a}} mass-point model, and the braking actions are assumed to be sparsely applied within the <b>cruising</b> <b>period.</b> In [5], an LQR optimal algorithm is adopted to minimize the coupler forces and velocit...|$|R
40|$|The rate of {{photosynthesis}} primarily {{depends on}} nutrients and photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) at sea surface. Several ship cruises {{were carried out}} to measure optical, biological, and atmospheric parameters in the Arabian Sea and their variability were studied. An analytical nonspectral photosynthesis-irradiance model was used to estimate euphotic primary production (EuPP) to study its variability during <b>cruise</b> <b>periods.</b> PAR was estimated using COART model using in situ measured aerosol optical depth (AOD) to compare with in situ measured PAR. In {{order to understand the}} variability of PAR under different types of aerosol and different aerosol loading, a simulation study was carried out using COART model. EuPP was estimated for various PAR values under different aerosol loading and cloud coverage conditions. Sensitivity analysis showed that for maritime, maritime polluted, and desert aerosols, the ratio PAR/PAR 0 AOD has attenuated to about 11 – 25 %, whereas it has attenuated to 44 % for urban aerosol type. PAR/PARclear[*][*]sky was reduced by ~ 57 % for high aerosol loading and for overcast sky. The decrease in EuPP under various aerosol loading and cloud coverage was observed to depend on the photoadaptation parameter.

W, 15 m a. s. l.) in the western Mediterranean from July 2011 to January 2012. Additional aerosol data from the three nearest AERONET stations (M??laga, Oujda and Palma de Mallorca) and the Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) were also analyzed in order to investigate the temporal and spatial variations of aerosol over this scarcely explored region. High aerosol loads over Albor??n were mainly associated with desert dust transport from North Africa and occasional advection of anthropogenic fine particles from central European urban-industrial areas. The fine particle load observed over Albor??n was surprisingly similar to that obtained over the other three nearest AERONET stations, suggesting homogeneous spatial distribution of fine particle loads over the four studied sites {{in spite of the}} large differences in local sources. The results from MAN acquired over the Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea and Atlantic Ocean from July to November 2011 revealed a pronounced predominance of fine particles during the <b>cruise</b> <b>period...</b>|$|E

The data were collected on ORV Sagar Kanya during the pre-INDOEX (27 December 1996 through 31 January 1997) and FFP- 98 (18 February to 31 March 1998) over the latitude range 15 degrees N to 14 degrees S and 15 degrees N to 20 degrees S respectively. During the pre-INDOEX, the MBL heights gradually decrease from 2. 5 km at 13 degrees N to around 500 to 600 m at 10 degrees S, Similar results are observed in the return track. The MBL heights (0. 5 to 1 km) obtained during FFP- 98 are less compared to those obtained during pre-INDOEX. The MBL heights during FFP- 98 are less compared to the pre-INDOEX and are believed to be due to the presence of stratus, stratocumulus and cumulus clouds during the <b>cruise</b> <b>period,</b> compared to a relatively cloud free pre-INDOEX cruise...|$|E

The river inflow from the 3 large estuary systems (Dee, Mersey and Ribble) forms a coastal front that moves < 10 km in response to semi-diurnal tidal straining and < 35 km due to the spring-neap cycle. The time variability of the density gradients in this coastal region are mainly controlled by salinity. Coastal observations are {{used in this study}} to improve the numerical simulation of the exchange process occurring at this front through improved spatial structure and temporal variability. A decade of Conductivity Temperature Depth (CTD) sensor observations were collected during cruises across a nearshore grid of monitoring stations.

Relatively higher values of Angstrom exponent (α) around 1. 2 near coast and 0. 2 – 0. 8 in the India’s EEZ, observed during the <b>cruise</b> <b>period,</b> indicate the presence of smaller particles near the coast due to anthropogenic activities; and larger particles in the India’s EEZ due to advection of pollutants from Indian subcontinent via long-range transport.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the challenges of}} developing a regional ocean prediction model for the Philippine Archipelago, a complex area in terms of geometry, bathymetry-dominated dynamics and variability, and strong local and remote wind forcing, where there are limited temporal and spatial ocean measurements. We used the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) for real-time forecasting during the Philippines Experiment (2007 – 2009) observational program. The article focuses on the prediction experiments {{before and during the}} exploratory <b>cruise</b> <b>period,</b> June 6 –July 3, 2007. The gathered observations were not available in real time, so the 4 -Dimensional Variational (4 D-Var) data assimilation experiments were carried out in hindcast mode. The best estimate of ocean state (nowcast) is determined by combining satellite-derived products for sea surface temperature and height, and subsurface temperature and salinity measurements from several hydrographic assets over a sequential five-day data assimilation window. The largest source of forecast uncertainty is from the prescribed lateral boundary conditions in the nearby Pacific Ocean, especially excessive salt flux. This result suggests that remote forcing and inflows from the Pacific are crucial for predicting ocean circulation in the Philippine Archipelago region. The lateral boundary conditions are derived from 1 / 12 ° global Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) daily snapshots. The incremental, strong-constraint 4 D-Var data assimilation successfully decreased temperature and salinity errors of the real-time, nonassimilative control forecast by 38 % and 49 %, respectively...|$|E

The major feature in the region during the <b>cruise</b> <b>period</b> was a strong meandering jet which flowed equatorward and offshore, oriented in a northeast to southwest direction. A density diagnostic version of the model, in which the sigma-theta is held constant during the 72 hour integration time, is compared with a robust diagnostic version of the model, in which the sigma-theta field is allowed to adjust dynamically within the constraints of a damping time scale. The density diagnostic version of the model produces vertical velociteis which are an order of magnitude larger than vertical calculated from bio-optical data collected in the same location {{and at the same time}} as the CTZ cruise. The robust diagnostic version produced vertical velocities within the range of vertical velocities calculated from the bio-optical data. The horizontal pattern of vertical velocity from the robust diagnostic version also compared well with patterns seen in trough/ridge systems in the Gulf Stream. In particular, there is horizontal convergence and downwelling all along the offshore directed part of the meandering jet. Vertical cross-section comparisons between model velocity data and ADCP velocity data collected during the cruise revealed differences which may be caused by factors neglected by the model (e. g. bottom topography, wind forcing, and heat fluxes) ...|$|E

The Strait of Bonifacio is a particularly sensitive marine area in which specific conservation measures {{have been taken to}} preserve the natural environment and wild species. Good knowledge of the hydro{{dynamics in}} this area is essential to optimize the Marine Protected Area’s management rules. Therefore, we used a high-resolution model (400 m) based on the MARS 3 D code to investigate the main flux exchanges and to formulate certain hypotheses about the formation of possible eddy structures.

The objective of the present investigation was to test the performance of both empirical (SeaWiFS OC 4 v 4) and semi-analytical (GSM 01 and CARDER) algorithms in the south-western Atlantic. In situ pigment and optical data have been collected in waters influenced by continental discharge from La Plata River and Patos Lagoon. The data was used to develop a regional version of the empirical SeaWiFS OC 2 v 4 algorithm (termed OC 2 -LP). The relative percentage difference (RPD) between in situ and algorithm-derived chlorophyll was 11 % in the regional version {{as compared to the}} global OC 4 v 4 (RPD 527 %). The GSM 01 and CARDER showed RPD of 14 % and 31 %, respectively.

Benthic chamber deployments were made at three stations in a transect away from the outfall pipe during three <b>cruise</b> <b>periods</b> (October 1990, February and October 1991). The fluxes of phosphate, silicate and radon- 222 showed the most significant difference (factor of 3) between stations proximal and distal to the sewage effluent outfall pipe; the fluxes of nitrate, ammonia, alkalinity and TCO 2 showed some gradient (a factor of 1. 5 – 2) and the uptake of oxygen showed no variability between sites. Carbon oxidation in these sediments is driven primarily by net oxygen consumption and secondarily by net sulfate reduction. Net sulfate reduction accounts for about 30 % of the carbon oxidation near the outfall pipe and 10 – 15 % at the distal sites. Measurements of radon- 222 fluxes and radon emanation rates from sediments indicate that the intensity of bio-irrigation is greater by a factor of 2 at sites away from the outfall pipe, but also shows that bio-irrigation does take place at the site adjacent to the pipe. The total amount of particulate organic carbon (POC) oxidized in the sediments around the outfall is B 2 107 g C/d. An estimate of carbon burial in this region is 4 107 g C/d. The outfall system could supply B 3 107 g C/d of which 12 – 20 % is estimated to have been deposited in the region.

Suzanne Dodd, Chief of the Mission Planning team describes the burn start and how the spacecraft will be captured by Mars' gravity. Glenn Cunningham, Mars Observer Project Manager, gives background information on the Mars Observer and describes the organizations behind the Mars Observer Spacecraft, such as the Deep Space Network, the Mission Operation Support Office, Science Investigators, the Flight Engineering Office, Operations Office, and the Ground Data System Office. Dr. William Piotrowski, Acting Director, Solar System Exploration Division, NASA, talks about the purpose of the Mars Pathfinder which is to develop the technology and systems for landing small science packages on Mars. Mr. Roger Gibbs, Former Mars Observer Spacecraft Systems Engineer, tells us how the Mars Observer was built and describes the structural elements on the Mars Observer. The 11 -month <b>cruise</b> <b>period</b> for the spacecraft is given by Joseph Beerer, Manager of the Engineering office. The thrust for the Mars Orbit Insertion is described by Ronald Klemetson, Technical Manager, Propulsion Subsystem Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). George Chen, Lead Engineer Attitude and Articulation Subsystem Spacecraft Team, explains the importance of the attitude control engines on the Spacecraft. Marvin Traxler, Manager of Tracking and Data Acquisition, describes how searching for a signal from the Mars Observer works.

40|$|Under the Mars Surveyor Program (MSP Ol), {{lithium-ion}} batteries {{were developed by}} Lithion, Inc. (Yardney Technical Products, Inc.), each being 28 V, 25 Ah, 8 -cells, and 9 kg and fully qualified prior to mission cancellation. In addition to the requirement {{of being able to}} supply at least 90 cycles on the surface of Mars, the battery was demonstrated of being capable of operation (both charge and discharge) over a large temperature range (- 20 °C to + 4 OoC), with tolerance to non-operational excursions to- 30 °C and 5 OOC. After mission cancellation, the batteries delivered to JPL were subjected to generic performance tests to demonstrate the applicability of the technology to meet fbture NASA aerospace applications. One of the two batteries currently being tested at JPL is undergoing testing according to anticipated performance requirements of future Mars Lander applications. The primary goal of this activity is to determine the performance capability to power surface operation on the planet Mars for a prolonged period (> 3 years) after being subjected to a long <b>cruise</b> <b>period.</b> The second 25 AHr battery is currently being tested to determine the viability of using lithium-ion technology for future planetary orbiter applications. The test implemented consists of cycling the battery continuously under LEO conditions (30 % DOD), while periodically checking the battery impedance and full capacity (100 % DOD). Prior to initiating these tests, a number of characterization tests were performed to determine general performance attributes and battery health. In addition to presenting battery data, results obtained with individual cells will also be presented to further describe the capabilities of the technology to meet fbture applications...|$|E
40|$|Comprehensive {{investigations}} {{during the}} last decade have clearly established that aerosols {{have a significant impact on}} the climate. No serious attempts were made to characterize the aerosols over the Bay of Bengal, despite its role in the regional climate system. This paper reports the results of the measurements of aerosol spectral optical depths made over the Bay of Bengal and compares them with those made over the equatorial Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea, on-board the oceanographic research vessel, Sagar Kanya during its cruise 161 -B in March 2001. The aerosol optical depth was found to decrease with distance from the coast with an exponential scale distance of apprx 1000 km for visible wavelengths and apprx 1600 km for near infra-red wavelengths. A significant dominance of small particle concentration near the coast is observed both over the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. The mean aerosol optical depth was higher over the Bay of Bengal compared to the Arabian Sea, at the shorter wavelengths. Over the equatorial Indian Ocean regions, aerosol optical depths were much lower compared to the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal and showed lesser wavelength dependence. The relative dominance of small particles is more over the Bay of Bengal compared to the Arabian Sea. Back-trajectory analysis shows that during the <b>cruise</b> <b>period,</b> the Arabian Sea was mainly influenced by air masses from the countries lying northwest of India, the Bay of Bengal by air masses from the east coast of India and the equatorial Indian Ocean mostly by the west coast and central India. The observed features are compared with long-term climatology of aerosol optical depth observations from the east and west coast of India and an island station in the Arabian Sea...|$|E
50|$|North Webster {{is home to}} Dixie, Indiana’s oldest sternwheel paddleboat. Dixie has cruised Webster Lake since 1929, {{providing}} {{tours of}} the lake to generations of residents and visitors. A number of private owners cared for and operated the boat from 1929 until 2007 when title was transferred to a nonprofit organization called Dixie Sternwheeler Inc., which operates the boat for regular summer cruises from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day and to allow chartered events such as weddings, retirement home outings, and company and community gatherings. Regular cruises last about 75 minutes and are each evening Monday through Saturday and during the afternoon and evening on Sunday. Many of the regular <b>cruises</b> feature <b>period</b> music and a narration with some history of the area, the lake, and Dixie.|$|R
2500|$|The Galilee was a brigantine, {{built in}} 1891, {{designed}} by Matthew Turner. She {{started on the}} packet line between San Francisco and Tahiti and was reckoned a very fast ship. In 1905 she was chartered by the Carnegie Institution's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism and converted into a magnetic observatory. She was used to make observations of Earth's magnetic field on three <b>cruises</b> over a <b>period</b> of three years from 1905 to 1908 in the Pacific Ocean.|$|R
50|$|Emerald Princess had a {{power outage}} on July 25, 2010 {{on the first}} day of a seven-day Eastern Caribbean <b>cruise.</b> For {{extended}} <b>periods</b> during the 4+ hour outage, there was no air conditioning, no elevator service, limited lighting, and toilets could not flush. As a result of the outage, Emerald Princess missed its first port of call the following day. Passengers were credited US$300 per stateroom for the inconvenience. Princess Cruises has not yet determined the cause of the outage.|$|R
