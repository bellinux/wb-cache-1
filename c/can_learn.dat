5|$|In the Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga {{role-playing}} games, players {{take control}} of the characters Serph, Heat, Argilla, Gale and Cielo, with the characters Sera and Roland becoming playable in Digital Devil Saga 2. These characters are able to transform into a demon form, which is their main form in battle. Characters navigate to-scale environments, fighting enemies in both random encounters and story-focused boss battles. After each battle, experience points are awarded to characters. Character abilities are governed by Mantra Grids, a system where Mantras are bought using the in-game currency Macca, then mastering them using Atma Points gained from defeated enemies. The maximum number of abilities that a character <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> is eight. If two or more characters equip a certain ability, they can perform a stronger version of it through a combo. Each character <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> abilities from one of four categories: Physical, Magic, Shield and Auto.|$|E

5|$|Service {{learning}} {{is one of}} the fastest growing community service outlets at the college; students enjoy being able to accomplish community service while receiving credits in the classroom.

Eleven academic departments and more than twenty courses at Saint Anselm offer service-learning opportunities.|$|E
5|$|Because DNA {{collects}} mutations over time, {{which are}} then inherited, it contains historical information, and, by comparing DNA sequences, geneticists can infer the evolutionary history of organisms, their phylogeny. This field of phylogenetics is a powerful tool in evolutionary biology. If DNA sequences within a species are compared, population geneticists <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> the history of particular populations. This {{can be used in}} studies ranging from ecological genetics to anthropology; For example, DNA evidence is being used to try to identify the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel.|$|E

5|$|Diamond {{writes that}} jury {{consultants}} then compare the three data sets {{to determine which}} background characteristics correlate to favorable attitudes and verdicts, and which attitudes correlate to favorable verdicts. Attorneys can then use that information to select favorable jurors, based either on prospective jurors' characteristics or whatever an attorney <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> about jurors' attitudes. This has prompted the most frequent criticism of SJS: that consultants stack juries with inexorably biased or dumb jurors; in turn, practitioners insist this is impossible and that bias can only be removed from a jury pool.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to gaining levels, Guardian Forces earn Ability Points (AP) after battles, which are automatically allocated to special abilities that Guardian Forces <b>can</b> <b>learn.</b> When a Guardian Force has learned an ability, that ability becomes available for any character or the character party, {{as is the}} case with field abilities. These abilities allow characters to attack more efficiently, refine magic spells from items, receive stat bonuses upon leveling up, access shops remotely and use additional battle commands.|$|E

A knowledgeable forager of Temnothorax albipennis will lead a naive nest-mate to newly discovered food by the process of tandem running. The follower obtains knowledge through its leading tutor. The leader is acutely sensitive to the progress of the follower and slows down when the follower lags and speeds up when the follower gets too close.|$|E

The player <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> new recipes by collecting new dishes directly, but can also learn them by combining ingredients without first knowing the recipe.|$|E
5|$|Blitzball is a minigame that {{requires}} strategy and tactics. The underwater sport is {{played in a}} large, hovering sphere of water surrounded by a larger audience of onlookers. The player controls one character at a time as they swim through the sphere performing passes, tackles, and attempts to score. The gameplay {{is similar to that}} of the main game in the way that the controlled character moves through the area until they encounter an enemy. In this case, the enemy is a member of the opposing team. Status effects are also implemented in the minigame as each player <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> techniques that are equivalent to abilities in the main game.|$|E

5|$|In {{intelligent}} mammals, such as primates, the cerebrum {{is larger}} {{relative to the}} rest of the brain. Intelligence itself is not easy to define, but indications of intelligence include the ability to learn, matched with behavioral flexibility. Rats, for example, are considered to be highly intelligent, as they <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> and perform new tasks, an ability that may be important when they first colonize a fresh habitat. In some mammals, food gathering appears to be related to intelligence: a deer feeding on plants has a brain smaller than a cat, which must think to outwit its prey.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Creeper {{goes to a}} pawn {{store to}} buy a brooch for Helen, and kills the {{pawnbroker}} (Charles Wagenheim) following a fight. He later brings the brooch to Helen, who he realizes {{for the first time}} is blind. Hal learns she needs $3,000 for surgery that would restore her eyesight. When Helen tries to touch his face, Hal angrily storms out. He then goes to the Scott residence and demands money from Clifford and Virginia, whom he blames for his disfigurement. Clifford draws a gun and shoots Hal twice in the stomach, but the weakened Hal manages to strangle Clifford to death before escaping with Virginia's jewels. He brings them to Helen, who is concerned about Hal's injuries, but he flees before she <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> he is shot.|$|E

He passes a sample of marijuana around the class so that the children <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> its smell, but it is never returned. As a result, Mackey is fired, and is later kicked out of his house, leaving him homeless. A desperate Mackey gives in to trying marijuana one night in an alley, and later, LSD. Soon enough, Mr. Mackey becomes a drug-addled hippie, and meets a female hippie, with whom he decides to get married. While on honeymoon in India, Mr. Mackey is captured and taken into rehab.

5|$|Pinker's 1994 The Language Instinct was {{the first}} of several books to combine {{cognitive}} science with behavioral genetics and evolutionary psychology. It introduces the science of language and popularizes Noam Chomsky's theory that language is an innate faculty of mind, with the controversial twist that the faculty for language evolved by natural selection as an adaptation for communication. Pinker criticizes several widely held ideas about language – that it needs to be taught, that people's grammar is poor and getting worse with new ways of speaking, the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis that language limits the kinds of thoughts a person can have, and that other great apes <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> languages. Pinker sees language as unique to humans, evolved to solve the specific problem of communication among social hunter-gatherers. He argues that it is as much an instinct as specialized adaptative behavior in other species, such as a spider's web-weaving or a beaver's dam-building.|$|E
5|$|Rodents {{including}} guinea pigs, mice, rats, hamsters, gerbils, chinchillas, degus and chipmunks make convenient pets {{able to live}} {{in small}} spaces, each species with its own qualities. Most are normally kept in cages of suitable sizes and have varied requirements for space and social interaction. If handled from a young age, they are usually docile and do not bite. Guinea pigs have a long lifespan and need a large cage. Rats also need plenty of space and can become very tame, <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> tricks and seem to enjoy human companionship. Mice are short-lived but take up very little space. Hamsters are solitary but tend to be nocturnal. They have interesting behaviors, but unless handled regularly they may be defensive. Gerbils are not usually aggressive, rarely bite and are sociable animals that enjoy the company of humans and their own kind.|$|E
