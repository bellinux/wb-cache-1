40|$|International audienceWe {{studied the}} effect of the {{dispersion}} and/or morphology within the positive composite electrode on the lithium battery performance. Model electrodes have been prepared in which the surrounding of the same AM (Li 1. 1 V 3 O 8) is changed by playing with plasticization of the polymeric binder (B) (PMMA) by ethylene carbonate (EC) and propylene carbonate (PC). We have also varied the concentration, {{and the nature of the}} solvent used for the electrode elaboration (THF and CHCl 3). The <b>cycled</b> <b>capacity</b> varies between 100 and 250 mA h/g (C/ 5 rate, 3. 3 – 2 V) depending on these parameters. The performance was shown to depend on the quality of AM, B, and carbon black (CB) dispersion within the electrode. The quality of the AM dispersion depends on the solvent concentration that affects the mixture viscosity. Formation of AM agglomerates results from high viscosity, while gradient concentrations appear due to sedimentation in low viscosity suspensions. Optimal distribution and subsequent electrode performance result from optimal solvent concentration. Better CB dispersion was obtained in the case of favourable interactions between the solvent and the polymer. This resulted in a higher electronic conductivity, a higher porosity, and improved electrochemical performance. Finally, the addition of EC–PC also favours the CB dispersion and further increases the cycling capacity...|$|E

Does walk training improve peak walking <b>capacity,</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>capacity,</b> {{and quality of life}} compared to cycle training? Is the endurance shuttle walk test (ESWT) responsive to change in walking capacity elicited by exercise training?DesignRandomised trial with concealed allocation, assessor blinding, and intention-to-treat analysis. Participants 36 people with stable COPD recruited with four dropouts. InterventionParticipants were randomised into either a walk or cycle training group. Both groups trained indoors for 30 to 45 minutes per session, three times weekly over eight weeks at Concord Hospital. Training intensities were based on baseline peak exercise tests and progressed as able. Outcome measuresThe primary outcome was endurance walking capacity measured by the ESWT. Secondary outcomes included peak walking capacity, peak and endurance <b>cycle</b> <b>capacity,</b> and health-related quality of life. Measures were taken at baseline (Week 0) and following training (Week 8). ResultsThe walk training group increased their endurance walking time by 279 seconds (95 % CI 70 to 483) more than the cycle training group. No significant differences between the groups were found for any other outcome.
