40|$|Gas sensing systems {{based on}} fibre optic linked near infra red {{absorption}} cells are potentially a flexible and effective tool for monitoring accumulations of hazardous and noxious gases in enclosed {{areas such as}} tunnels and mines.

40|$|A {{technique}} {{has been developed}} for producing calibrated metal hydride films {{for use in the}} measurement of high-energy (5 [...] 15 MeV) particle reaction cross sections for hydrogen and helium isotopes on hydrogen isotopes. Absolute concentrations of various hydrogen isotopes in the film is expected to be determined to better than {+-} 2 % leading to the capacity of accurately measuring various reaction cross sections. Hydrogen isotope concentrations from near 100 % to 5 % can be made accurately and reproducibly. This is accomplished with the use of high accuracy pressure measurements coupled with high accuracy mass spectrometric measurements of each constituent partial pressure of the gas mixture during loading of the metal occluder films. Various techniques are used to verify the amount of metal present as well as the amount of hydrogen isotopes; high energy ion scattering analysis, PV measurements before, during and after loading, and thermal desorption/mass spectrometry measurements. The most appropriate metal to use for the occluder film appears to be titanium but other occluder metals are also being considered. <b>Calibrated</b> <b>gas</b> ratio samples, previously prepared, are used for the loading gas.

40|$|An inter-laboratory {{exercise}} {{was carried out}} by a consortium of five European laboratories to establish a set of compounds, suitable for <b>calibrating</b> <b>gas</b> chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS) devices, to be used as isotopic reference materials for hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen stable isotope measurements. The set of compounds was chosen with the aim of developing a mixture of reference materials to be used in analytical protocols to check for food and beverage authentication. The {{exercise was}} organized in several steps to achieve the certification level: the first step consisted of the a priori selection of chemical compounds {{on the basis of the}} scientific literature and successive GC tests to set the analytical conditions for each single compound and the mixture. After elimination of the compounds that turned out to be unsuitable in a multi-compound mixture, some additional oxygen- and nitrogen-containing substances were added to complete the range of calibration isotopes. The results of d 13 C determinations for the entire set of reference compounds have previously been published, while the dD and d 18 O determinations were unsuccessful and after statistical analysis of the data the results did not reach the level required for certification.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} pertinent design {{practices of}} selecting types of monitors, monitor unit placement, setpoint selection, and maintenance considerations for gas monitors. While hydrogen gas monitors and enriched oxygen atmosphere monitors {{as they would}} be needed for hydrogen production experiments are {{the primary focus of}} this paper, monitors for carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are also discussed. The experiences of designing, installing, and <b>calibrating</b> <b>gas</b> monitors for a laboratory where experiments in support of the DOE Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative (NHI) are described along with codes, standards, and regulations for these monitors. Information from the literature about best operating practices is also presented. The NHI program has two types of activities. The first, near-term activity is laboratory and pilot-plant experimentation with different processes in the kilogram per day scale to select the most promising types of processes for future applications of hydrogen production. Prudent design calls for indoor gas monitors to sense any hydrogen leaks within these laboratory rooms. The second, longer-term activity is the prototype, or large-scale plants to produce tons of hydrogen per day. These large, outdoor production plants will require area (or “fencepost”) monitoring of hydrogen gas leaks. Some processes will have oxygen production with hydrogen production, and any oxygen releases are also safety concerns since oxygen gas is the strongest oxidizer. Monitoring of these gases is important for personnel safety of both indoor and outdoor experiments. There is some guidance available about proper placement of monitors. The fixed point, stationary monitor can only function if the intruding gas contacts the monitor. Therefore, monitor placement is vital to proper monitoring of the room or area. Factors in sensor location selection include: indoor or outdoor site, the location and nature of potential vapor/gas sources, chemical and physical data of the gases or vapors, liquids with volatility need sensors near the potential sources of release, nature and concentration of gas releases, natural and mechanical ventilation, detector installation locations not vulnerable to mechanical or water damage from normal operations, and locations that lend themselves to convenient maintenance and calibration. The guidance also states that sensors should be located in all areas where hazardous accumulations of gas may occur. Such areas might not be close to release points but might be areas with restricted air movement. Heavier than air gases are likely to accumulate in pits, trenches, drains, and other low areas. Lighter than air gases are more likely to accumulate in overhead spaces, above drop ceilings, etc. In general, sensors should be located close to any potential sources of major release of gas. The paper gives data on monitor sensitivity and expected lifetimes to support the monitor selection process. Proper selection of indoor and outdoor locations for monitors is described, accounting for the vapor densities of hydrogen and oxygen. The latest information on monitor alarm setpoint selection is presented. Typically, monitors require recalibration at least every six months, or more frequently for inhospitable locations, so ready access to the monitors is an important issue to consider in monitor siting. Gas monitors, depending on their type, can be susceptible to blockages of the detector element (i. e., du...|$|E

Gas distribution modeling is particularly useful in emission monitoring applications where spatial representations of the gaseous patches {{can be used to}} identify emission hot spots.

The approach presented in this work addresses the task of gas distribution modeling by combining different non selective gas sensors. Gas discrimination is addressed with an open sampling system, composed by an array of metal oxide sensors and a probabilistic algorithm tailored to uncontrolled environments. For each of the identified compounds, the mapping algorithm generates a <b>calibrated</b> <b>gas</b> distribution model using the classification uncertainty and the concentration readings acquired with a photo ionization detector.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{development}} of a high-performance readout scheme based on a switched-capacitor circuit and intended for use with an ultrasensitive microflowmeter. The microflow transducer improves significantly on the resolution of current flow devices and uses a differential capacitive pressure sensor to measure the flow. The readout electronics feature a clocking speed of 100 kHz and can drive loads as high as 35 pF. The high d. c. gain of the circuit topology (75 dB) is relatively insensitive to stray input capacitance and is ideally suited for a multichip sensor realization. The uncompensated linearity of the overall readout circuit is 10 bits and the pressure/flow resolution is 12 bits. Since ultrasensitive membranes respond to electrostatic forces, the output is characterized {{as a function of the}} duty cycle and pulse width of the readout clocking waveforms. The membrane does not respond to these waveforms for high frequencies (> 50 kHz), but for lower frequencies the diaphragm deflects in response to the time-average voltage applied across the device. A self-test mode can therefore be implemented simply by changing the duty cycle of this pulse. By modifying the amplitude of the waveform, the device can be autocalibrated over a limited pressure range.

Overall, total ionization efficiencies close to 100 % and ionization efficiencies into a single charge state up to 22 % were measured.

The addition of a small amount of helium can increase the ionization efficiency into a single charge state by narrowing the charge state distribution.
