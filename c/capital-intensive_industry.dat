25|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, the brewing {{industry}} in northern Europe {{changed from a}} small-scale domestic industry to a large-scale export industry. The key innovation was the introduction of hops, which began in northern Germany in the 13th century. Hops sharply improved both the brewing process {{and the quality of}} beer. Other innovations from German lands involved larger kettle sizes and more frequent brewing. Consumption went up, while brewing became more concentrated because it was a <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>industry.</b> Thus in Hamburg per capita consumption increased from an average of 300 liters per year in the 15th century to about 700 in the 17th century.|$|E
25|$|Structural {{unemployment}} in Muslim countries {{seems to be}} high for women and economic opportunities are limited. Possible explanations for this phenomenon could the same determinants of high self-employment among females and low rates of female employers: low levels of economic development, gendered employment social norms, or <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>industry.</b> This last explanation may be particularly salient in the oil-rich Muslim nations because petroleum exports are capital-intensive and require very high skilled labor which most Muslim women are incapable of providing given low levels of education. The Great Recession has increased unemployment across the board in many Muslim nations and female workers were not left unaffected. According to the World Bank, in 2009, 22.9% of women were unemployed in Egypt.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a three-sector static model {{to explore the}} rationale {{for a series of}} institutional distortions in developing countries. The authors argue that, after World War II, motivated by a belief in the development of state-of-the-art industries as a means for nation building, the majority of developing country governments attempted to accelerate the growth of advanced <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>industries.</b> However, since developing countries are relatively rich in labor or natural resource endowments but not in capital endowment, advanced <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>industries</b> were not adapted to the endowment structures of these developing countries at the time. Enterprises in those industries were non-viable in open, competitive markets and could not survive without government subsidization or protection. The model shows that, in order to mobilize resources into the capital-intensive, advanced sectors, it is necessary for governments to use distortionary policies such as taxes and subsidies, distortions of factor prices, directive allocation of resources, and nationalization of enterprises. Such distortions enable developing countries to set up advanced, <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>industries</b> in the early stage of their development. However, they also tend to suppress incentives, misallocate resources, and make the economy inefficient.

40|$|Human capital often {{cannot be}} {{acquired}} in efficient labor markets due to poor information or firm-specific skills that develop over time. Since such knowledge may {{be critical to}} firms building a strategic capability, {{it is not surprising}} that many acquisitions occur in human <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>industries.</b> Yet, the uncertainty associated with human capital increases the risk of overbidding.

50|$|The recent {{liberalization}} {{of the electricity}} market in many countries has made the economics of nuclear power generation less attractive, and no new nuclear power plants have been built in a liberalized electricity market. Previously a monopolistic provider could guarantee output requirements decades into the future. Private generating companies now have to accept shorter output contracts and the risks of future lower-cost competition from subsidised energy sources, so they desire a shorter return on investment period. This favours generation plant types with lower capital costs or high subsidies, even if associated fuel costs are higher. A further difficulty is that due to the large sunk costs but unpredictable future income from the liberalized electricity market, private capital {{is unlikely to be}} available on favourable terms, which is particularly significant for nuclear as it is <b>capital-intensive.</b> <b>Industry</b> consensus is that a 5% discount rate is appropriate for plants operating in a regulated utility environment where revenues are guaranteed by captive markets, and 10% discount rate is appropriate for a competitive deregulated or merchant plant environment; however the independent MIT study (2003) which used a more sophisticated finance model distinguishing equity and debt capital had a higher 11.5% average discount rate.|$|E
40|$|Do {{variations}} in labor market institutions across countries affect the cross-border {{organization of the}} firm? Using firm-level data on multinationals located in France, we show that firms {{are more likely to}} outsource the production of intermediate inputs to external suppliers when importing from countries with empowered unions. Moreover, this effect is stronger for firms operating in <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>industries.</b> We propose a theoretical mechanism that rationalizes these findings. The fragmentation of the value chain weakens the union's bargaining position, by limiting the amount of revenues that are subject to union extraction. The outsourcing strategy reduces the share of surplus that is appropriated by the union, which enhances the firm's incentives to invest. Since investment creates relatively more value in <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>industries,</b> increases in union power {{are more likely to be}} conducive to outsourcing in those industries. Overall, our findings suggest that multinational firms use their organizational structure strategically when sourcing intermediate inputs from unionized markets...|$|R

50|$|America's {{nuclear power}} industry, which {{currently}} supplies about 20% of the country's electricity, has {{its origins in}} the Manhattan Project to develop atomic weapons during World War II. From 1942 to 1945, the United States invested $20 billion (2003 dollars) into a massive nuclear research and deployment initiative. But {{the achievement of the}} first nuclear weapon test in 1945 marked the beginning, not the end, of federal involvement in nuclear technologies. President Dwight D. Eisenhower's “Atoms for Peace” address in 1953 and the 1954 Atomic Energy Act committed the United States to develop peaceful uses for nuclear technology, including commercial energy generation. The new National Laboratory system, established by the Manhattan Project, was maintained and expanded, and the government poured money into nuclear energy research and development. Recognizing that research was not sufficient to spur the development of a nascent, <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>industry,</b> the federal government created financial incentives to spur the deployment of nuclear energy. For example, the 1957 Price Anderson Act limited the liability of nuclear energy firms in case of serious accident and helped firms secure capital with federal loan guarantees. In the favorable environment created by such incentives, more than 100 nuclear plants were built in the United States by 1973.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} market barriers {{experienced by}} Swedish innovators in start-up companies {{early in the}} process of bringing environmental innovations to the market. The studied innovators are mainly active in a business-to-business market that often involves <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>industry</b> sectors and large companies are seen as important customers. Most of the market barriers identified can be related to customer relations. The innovators experience their customers’ negative attitudes and unwillingness to try new technologies as major barriers. Furthermore, they perceived their customers to be conservative and reluctant to take risks. These barriers may be relevant in most innovation developments although they may be more articulated for environmental innovations since such innovations mostly evolve in emerging industries and since <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>industry</b> sectors dominate the area. Measures to stimulate diffusion of environmental innovation are discussed, including ways to encourage customers to test new technologies and to see the adoption of the innovation as worth the perceived risks...|$|E
30|$|In <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>industries,</b> the {{behavior}} of CEO is restricted due to much investment on fixed assets[29, 30]. Such restricted behavior of CEOs in <b>capital-intensive</b> <b>industries</b> leads {{to a point where}} CEOs remain caught in the practice and custom carried out by the previous CEOs. In turn, CEOs’ restricted behavior impedes them from undertaking risk-taking strategy, only making efficient management of fixed assets. So, competition strategy to focus on efficiency becomes important and only cost control can be a key success factor[22]. Thus, the throughput background of CEO tends to have a positive relationship with a strategy to focus on efficiency[14, 15]. In these situations, CEOs will be inclined not to pursue new tries to avoid mistake-related new investments. However, there are studies suggest that the formal education of CEO has a positive relationship with risk taking than efficient management[16, 31]. Overall, the following hypotheses can be derived in relation to entrepreneur’s attributes which will affect their choices when it comes to starting a new business in information technology industry.|$|R
