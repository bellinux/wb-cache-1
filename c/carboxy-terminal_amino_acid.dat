40|$|AbstractA new crystal {{structure}} of the dimeric cysteine synthase CysM from Mycobacterium tuberculosis reveals an open and a closed conformation of the enzyme. In the closed conformation the five <b>carboxy-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> residues are inserted into the active site cleft. Removal of this segment results in a decreased lifetime of the α-aminoacrylate reaction intermediate, an increased sensitivity to oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide, and loss of substrate selectivity {{with respect to the}} sulfur carrier thiocarboxylated CysO. These results highlight features of CysM that might be of particular importance for cysteine biosynthesis under oxidative stress in M. tuberculosis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. 13 -Tubulin is {{encoded in}} the genomes of higher animals {{by a small}} multigene family {{comprising}} approximately seven functional genes. These genes produce a family of closely related, but distinct polypeptide isotypes that are distinguished principally by sequences within the,x, 15 <b>carboxy-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> residues. By immunizing rabbits with chemically synthesized peptides corresponding to these variable domain sequences, we have now prepared polyclonal antibodies specific for each of six distinct isotypes. Specificity of each antiserum has been demonstrated unambiguously by antibody binding to bacterially produced, cloned proteins representing each isotype and by the inhibition of such binding by preincubation of each antiserum only with the immunizing peptide an...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that the carboxyl terminus of microbody enzymes functions as a targeting signal to mi-crobodies in higher plants. We have examined an ability of 24 <b>carboxy-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> sequences to facilitate the transport of a cytosolic passenger protein, /^glucuroni-dase, into microbodies in green cotyledonary cells of trans-genic Arabidopsis. Immunoelectron microscopic analysis revealed that carboxy-terminal tripeptide sequences of the form [C/A/S/P]-[K/R]-[I/L/M] function as a microbody-targeting signal, although tripeptides with proline at the first amino acid position and isoleucine at the carboxyl ter-minus show weak targeting efficiencies. All known micro-body enzymes that are synthesized in a form similar in size to the mature molecule, except catalase, contain one of these tripeptide sequences at their carboxyl terminus...|$|E
40|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus Rev protein is posttranslationally modified by a serine kinase activity present in {{the nucleus of the}} cell. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to identify the site of phosphorylation. Changing of serine residues 92 and 99 dramatically reduced Rev phosphorylation, suggesting that at least one, if not both, of these residues is the one recognized by the Rev-specific serine kinase. Similarly, a truncated Rev protein lacking the 25 <b>carboxy-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> was not phosphorylated. By using two independent assays, both the serine mutant proteins and the truncated form of Rev were found to be fully functional. Thus, phosphorylation and the 25 <b>carboxy-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> appear to be dispensable for protein function...|$|R

40|$|The {{scaffolding}} {{protein and}} associated protease {{of the human}} herpesvirus varicella-zoster virus (VZV), encoded by genes 33. 5 and 33 respectively, were synthesized in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system. The expressed 33. 5 product formed numerous long, flexible, hollow rods, and in this respect different from the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) homologue which forms large aggregates consisting mainly of fibrous material interspersed with scaffold-like particles. Removal of 27 <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> from the carboxy terminus of the VZV scaffolding protein by the gene 33 protease or expression of the cleaved product {{did not result in}} any discernible change in the morphology of the scaffolding protein. Again, this was in marked contrast to the situation in HSV- 1 where removal of the 25 <b>carboxy-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> from the scaffolding protein by the associated protease or expression of VP 22 a results in the formation of large numbers of scaffold-like particles. Despite these differences, when cells were multiply infected with baculoviruses expressing the HSV- 1 capsid shell proteins and the VZV scaffolding protein complete capsids were observed, suggesting that the VZV protein could act as a scaffold for the assembly of the HSV- 1 capsid shell. The efficiency of capsid assembly was increased substantially by exchanging the 23 <b>carboxy-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> of the VZV scaffolding protein for the corresponding 22 <b>carboxy-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> of the HSV- 1 homologue, supporting previous work which showed that this region was critical for the formation of intact capsids...|$|R
40|$|The sliding clamp of the {{bacteriophage}} T 4 DNA polymerase, gp 45, is {{also the}} proximal effector for activation of transcription of T 4 late genes. We have identified the phage T 4 -encoded sigma factor gp 55 and the co-activator gp 33 as targets of gp 45 in promoter complexes, and have shown that a conserved <b>carboxy-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> sequence of gp 55 and gp 33 is required for interaction with gp 45. The respective contribution of each target-gp 45 interaction to activation of transcription has been assessed by measuring promoter opening rates. The opening rate supported by interaction with both targets is far greater than the arithmetical sum of the separate contributions of each target, implying a synergistic activation of transcription through at least two separate interactions of the trimeric gp 45...|$|E
40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of the specific carrier of retinol (retinol-binding protein, RBP) purified from chicken plasma has been determined (space group P 2 (1) 2 (1) 2 (1), with a = 46. 06 (5) Angstrom, b = 53. 56 (6) Angstrom, c = 73. 41 (8) Angstrom, and one protein molecule in the asymmetric unit). Despite being obtained from a species phylogenetically distant from mammals, chicken holoRBP has an overall structure that closely resembles the previously determined structures of mammalian holoRBPs. The lack in chicken RBP of eight <b>carboxy-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> residues characteristic of mammalian RBPs does not significantly affect the protein structure. A distinctive feature of the avian protein is a better definition of the loop 63 - 67, close {{to the opening of}} the beta -barrel cavity accommodating the retinol molecule, which is rather disordered in the structures of mammalian RBPs...|$|E
40|$|The gene ARHGAP 11 B {{promotes}} basal progenitor amplification and is {{implicated in}} neocortex expansion. It arose {{on the human}} evolutionary lineage by partial duplication of ARHGAP 11 A, which encodes a Rho guanosine triphosphatase-activating protein (RhoGAP). However, a lack of 55 nucleotides in ARHGAP 11 B mRNA leads to loss of RhoGAP activity by GAP domain truncation and addition of a human-specific <b>carboxy-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> sequence. We show that these 55 nucleotides are deleted bymRNA splicing due to a single C -> G substitution that creates a novel splice donor site. We reconstructed an ancestral ARHGAP 11 B complementary DNA without this substitution. Ancestral ARHGAP 11 B exhibits RhoGAP activity but has no ability to increase basal progenitors during neocortex development. Hence, a single nucleotide substitution underlies the specific properties of ARHGAP 11 B that likely contributed to the evolutionary expansion of the human neocortex...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a secretion vector system for introducing foreign genes into Bacillus subtilis. We constructed secretion vectors from the plasmid pUB 110 and the promoter and signal sequence {{region of the}} alpha-amylase gene from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. Foreign structural genes can be inserted into the various vectors after the signal sequence region of the alpha-amylase gene. Demonstrating secretion of a foreign gene product from Bacillus, we here report that the Escherichia coli beta-lactamase gene, devoid of its own signal sequence coding region, can be expressed in B. subtilis by {{the aid of the}} secretion vectors so that greater than 95 % of the enzyme activity is secreted to the growth medium. Efficient secretion of beta-lactamase (penicillin amido-beta-lactamhydrolase, EC 3. 5. 2. 6) is observed if the complete signal sequence coding region of the alpha-amylase gene precedes the beta-lactamase structural gene. However, an incomplete alpha-amylase signal peptide lacking the six <b>carboxy-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> residues does not promote secretion of the fused beta-lactamase, which remains unprocessed and cell-associated...|$|E
40|$|The gene {{encoding}} the B subunit of heat-labile enterotoxin (etxB) was mutated at its 3 ' end by targeted {{addition of}} random nucleotide sequences. Gene products from five mutated etxB genes, {{all of which}} were shown to encode B subunits with short <b>carboxy-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> extensions, were analyzed with respect to a range of functional and structural properties. One class of altered B subunits, exemplified by EtxB 124 and EtxB 138, which both have seven extra amino acid residues, were found to be specifically defective in their ability to stably associate with A subunits and form holotoxin. Other altered B subunits were less subtlely affected by extensions at their C termini and were, in addition to their failure to associate with A subunits, unable to translocate into the periplasm of Escherichia coli, to pentamerize, or to bind to GM 1 ganglioside. This suggests that the carboxy-terminal domain of EtxB mediates A subunit-B subunit interaction...|$|E
40|$|A cDNA {{fragment}} synthesized from mouse mRNA (ACTH/LPH mRNA) that {{codes for}} the precursor polypeptide containing corticotropin (ACTH), beta-lipotropin (LPH), {{and several other}} peptides has been cloned in bacteria. The mRNA was enriched for ACTH/LPH mRNA translational activity (to about 75 %) prior to cDNA synthesis. It appears to contain about 1200 bases, of which approximately 450 bases are not translated. The cloned DNA fragment is complementary to {{the region of the}} mRNA coding for the protein fragment beta-LPH-(44 [...] 90); this contains all of the amino acids of [Met]-enkephalin (residues 61 [...] 65 of beta-LPH), most of the amino acids of beta-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, and all but the <b>carboxy-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> of beta-endorphin. Based on assignment of the amino acid sequence of mouse beta-LPH from the nucelic acid sequence, it appears that there is extensive homology of mouse beta-LPH with human and porcine beta-LPH. The data also establish the linkage between beta-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and beta-endorphin as a Lys-Arg sequence. It is hoped that this cloned DNA {{can be used as a}} probe to study the expression and structure of the ACTH/LPH gene...|$|E
40|$|Polyclonal and {{monoclonal}} antibodies {{were raised}} against a synthetic peptide containing the 15 <b>carboxy-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> (497 - 511) of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G). The polyclonal antibodies (alpha P 4) reacted with epitopes distributed along the 15 -residue peptide, whereas the monoclonal antibody (P 5 D 4) reacted with one epitope containing the five <b>carboxy-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids.</b> Both types of antibodies recognized the cytoplasmic domain of VSV-G synthesized by tissue culture cells {{infected with the}} temperature-sensitive 045 -VSV mutant (ts 045 -VSV). They recognized immature forms of VSV-G in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and Golgi complex, as well as mature VSV-G at the cell surface and in budding virus. The effect of these antibodies on intracellular transport and maturation of VSV-G was studied by microinjection. Both divalent antibodies (alpha P 4 and P 5 D 4) blocked transport of VSV-G to the cell surface. Monovalent Fab' fragments of alpha P 4 (alpha P 4 -Fabs) also interfered {{with the appearance of}} VSV-G at the cell surface; Fab fragments of P 5 D 4 (P 5 D 4 -Fabs), however, had no inhibitory effect. These results suggest that accessibility of a cytoplasmic domain, located within the sequence of <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> 497 - 506 of the carboxy-terminal tail, is essential for transport of VSV-G to the cell surface...|$|R
40|$|Monoamine oxidase B, {{a typical}} {{intrinsic}} protein {{of the outer}} mitochondrial membrane, has an uncleavable targeting signal and is inserted into the membrane without proteolytic maturation. To investigate the region responsible for targeting the enzyme to the outer mitochondrial membrane, various mutated proteins were expressed in cultured mam-malian cells, and the distributions of the expressed proteins were analyzed by immuno-fluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation. Deletion of the <b>carboxy-terminal</b> 28 <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> of monoamine oxidase B abolished {{the transfer of the}} enzyme to mitochondria, while the deletion of the amino-terminal 65 <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> had no effect on the transfer to mitochondria. The existence of the targeting signal at the carboxy-terminal portion of the enzyme was confirmed by using hybrid proteins in which the amino- or carboxy-terminal portion of the enzyme was fused to the hydrophilic portion of cytochrome fe. The fused protein with the <b>carboxy-terminal</b> 29 <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> residues of monoamine oxidase B was localized in mitochondria, whereas that with 10 <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> remained in the cytoplasm.

40|$|The tick {{carboxypeptidase}} inhibitor (TCI) is a proteinaceous inhibitor of metallo-carboxypeptidases {{present in}} the blood-sucking tick Rhipicephalus bursa. The three-dimensional crystal structures of recombinant TCI bound to bovine carboxypeptidase A and to human carboxypeptidase B have been determined and refined at 1. 7 Å and at 2. 0 Å resolution, respectively. TCI consists of two domains that are structurally similar despite the low degree of sequence homology. The domains, each consisting of a short α-helix followed by a small twisted antiparallel β-sheet, show {{a high level of}} structural homology to proteins of the β-defensin-fold family. TCI anchors to the surface of mammalian carboxypeptidases in a double-headed manner not previously seen for carboxypeptidase inhibitors: the last three <b>carboxy-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> residues interact with the active site of the enzyme in a way that mimics substrate binding, and the N-terminal domain binds to an exosite distinct from the active-site groove. The structures of these complexes should prove valuable in the applications of TCI as a thrombolytic drug and as a basis for the design of novel bivalent carboxypeptidase inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} polymer-bound {{antimicrobial}} peptides was prepared, and the peptides were tested for their antimicrobial activities. The immobilized peptides were prepared by {{a strategy that}} used solid-phase peptide synthesis that linked the <b>carboxy-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> with an ethylenediamine-modified polyamide resin (PepsynK). The acid-stable, permanent amide bond between the support and the nascent peptide renders the peptide resistant to cleavage from the support during the final acid-catalyzed deprotection step in the synthesis. Select immobilized peptides containing amino acid sequences that ranged from the naturally occurring magainin to simpler synthetic sequences with idealized secondary structures were excellent antimicrobial agents against several organisms. The immobilized peptides typically {{reduced the number of}} viable cells by > or = 5 log units. We show that the reduction in cell numbers cannot be explained by the action of a soluble component. We observed no leached or hydrolyzed peptide from the resin, nor did we observe any antimicrobial activity in soluble extracts from the immobilized peptide. The immobilized peptides were washed and reused for repeated microbial contact and killing. These results suggest that the surface actions by magainins and structurally related antimicrobial peptides are sufficient for their lethal activities...|$|E

Chem. 276 : 26479 - 26485, 2001) {{has shown}} the Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1244 pilin glycan to be covalently bound to a serine residue. N-terminal {{sequencing}} of pilin fragments produced from endopeptidase treatment and identified by reaction with a glycan-specific monoclonal antibody indicated that the glycan was present between residue 75 and the pilin carboxy terminus. Further sequencing of these peptides revealed that serine residues 75, 81, 84, 105, 106, and 108 were not modified. Conversion of serine 148, but not serine 118, to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis, resulted in loss {{of the ability to}} carry out pilin glycosylation when tested in an in vivo system. These results showed the pilin glycan to be attached to residue 148, the <b>carboxy-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid.</b> The carboxy-proximal portion of the pilin disulfide loop, which is adjacent to the pilin glycan, was found to be a major linear B-cell epitope, as determined by peptide epitope mapping analysis.

40|$|Chorionic gonadotropin (CG) and lutropin (LH) {{are members}} of a family of {{glycoprotein}} hormones that share a common alpha subunit but differ in their hormone-specific beta subunits. The glycoprotein hormone beta subunits share a high degree of <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> homology that is most evident for the LH beta and CG beta subunits having greater than 80 % sequence similarity. However, transfection studies have shown that human CG beta and alpha can be secreted as monomers and can combine efficiently to form dimer, whereas secretion and assembly of human LH beta is less efficient. To determine which specific regions of the LH beta and CG beta subunits are responsible for these differences, mutant and chimeric LH beta-CG beta genes were constructed and transfected into CHO cells. Expression of these subunits showed that both the hydrophobic <b>carboxy-terminal</b> seven <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> and <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> Trp 8, Ile 15, Met 42, and Asp 77 together inhibit the secretion of LH beta. The <b>carboxy-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids,</b> along with Trp 8, Ile 15, Met 42, and Thr 58 are implicated in the delayed assembly of LH beta.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of gastrin with the cholecystokinin 2 (CCK 2) /gastrin receptor {{has been studied}} extensively in relation to gastric acid secretion. However, not much {{is known about the}} contribution of individual <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> of gastrin interacting with the CCK 2 receptor, when gastrin is acting as a tumor growth factor. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to determine the significance of each individual <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> residue of human gastrin- 17 with respect to CCK 2 receptor-mediated cell proliferation. Activation of this receptor was assessed using an in vitro bioassay based on gastrin-induced expression of a c-fos-luciferase reporter, transfected in AR 42 JB 13 and Colo 320 cells, a rat pancreatic and human colorectal cell line respectively. Gastrin- 17 dose dependently increased c-fos induction in both cancer cell lines. L 365, 260, a known CCK 2 receptor antagonist, completely blocked the gastrin signal, demonstrating the specificity of this assay. We demonstrated for the first time that four <b>carboxy-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> of gastrin- 17 are essential for activation of the CCK 2 receptor with respect to c-fos induction. Also other residues of gastrin- 17, notably glycine- 2 for the rat CCK 2 receptor and glutamic acid 8 - 10 and tyrosine- 12 for the human receptor, were found to be important, although to a lesser extent. Alanine-substitution variants of each of the four <b>carboxy-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> of gastrin- 17 showed strongly reduced receptor activation but did not act as competitive inhibitors of gastrin- 17. Identification of the essential role of the carboxy-terminal tetrapeptide of gastrin- 17 in CCK 2 receptor-mediated c-fos induction indicates that gastrin inhibitory therapeutic strategies should mainly be targeted toward this region of gastrin...|$|R

Henle's and Huxley's layers show no immunoreactivity with mK 6 irs 1 -specific antibodies and the absence of intermediate filament formation in electron microscopic images.

Our recent identification of a mitogen-activated protein kinase homologue in Leishmania mexicana which {{is essential for the}} proliferation of the amastigote stage of the parasite living in the parasitophorous vacuole of the infected macrophage prompted us to screen the genome of L. mexicana for additional mitogen-activated protein kinase homologues using degenerate oligonucleotide primers in a polymerase chain reaction amplification approach. We cloned and sequenced the genes for eight new mitogen-activated protein kinase homologues which were subsequently shown to be present in one copy per haploid genome. The mRNA levels of the kinases varied significantly in pro- and amastigote life stages of the parasite. We used the structural information of the p 38 stress-activated protein kinase, which belongs to the family of mitogen-activated protein kinases, for the alignment of the deduced proteins and the verification of the predicted secondary structure elements. All new mitogen-activated protein kinases reveal the typical 12 subdomain primary structure, the conserved residues characterising serine/threonine protein kinases and the characteristic TXY motif in the phosphorylation lip.

The practical applicability of this PDZ-based detection method {{is determined by the}} affinity of the PDZ domain•peptide ligand interaction, and the efficiency of the enzyme to process the masked peptide ligand. To expand the use of this PDZ-based detection strategy to a broader range of enzymatic assays, we have taken advantage of the plasticity in ligand recognition by the variety of PDZ domains found in nature. In the original work, the PDZ 3 of PSD- 95 was used, which preferentially recognizes the consensus sequence Ser-X-Val-COOH. Here, we show that NHERF PDZ 1, which binds to the consensus sequence Thr/Ser-X-Leu-COOH, can be used to extend the flexibility in the recognition of the <b>carboxy-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> of the ligand, and monitor the enzymatic activity of HIV protease.

The nucleotide {{sequence of the}} structural gene (cba) which encodes colicin B and of the upstream region was determined. A polypeptide consisting of 511 amino acids was deduced from the open reading frame. The active colicin had a molecular weight of 54, 742. The <b>carboxy-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> sequence showed striking homology to the corresponding channel-forming region of colicin A. Of 216 amino acids, 57 % were identical and an additional 19 % were homologous. In this part 66 % of the nucleotides were identical in the colicin A and B genes. This region contained a sequence of 48 hydrophobic amino acids. Sequence homology to the other channel-forming colicins, E 1 and I, was less pronounced. A homologous pentapeptide was detected in colicins B, M, and I whose uptake required TonB protein function. The same consensus sequence was found in all outer membrane proteins involved in the TonB-dependent uptake of iron siderophores and of vitamin B 12. Upstream of cba a sequence comprising 294 nucleotides was identical to the sequence upstream of the structural gene of colicin E 1, {{with the exception of}} 43 single-nucleotide replacements, additions, or deletions. Apparently, the region upstream of colicins B and E 1 and the channel-forming sequences of colicins A and B have a common origin...|$|E
40|$|Synthesis and {{secretion}} of fi-lactamase {{were studied}} in Salmonella typhimurium infected with P 22 phage carrying the structural gene for / 3 -lactamase (the b/a gene) in mutant or wild-type form. The wildtype gene {{was shown to}} specify two forms of /Ilactamase which differ in molecular weight by about 2500 daltons. This difference is consistent with removal, predicted on other grounds, of 23 aminoterminal residues (the “signal ” sequence). All b/amutants, including chain-terminating mutants lacking as much as 50 % or as little as 10 % of the protein, were apparently unaffected in this processing step. Pulse-chase experiments showed that more than 85 % of the wild-type (as well as mutant) proteins are synthesized as complete overlength precursors before being processed to their mature forms. Virtually all the mature wild-type protein appears in the periplasmic space whereas a large fraction of the precursor appears in the cytoplasm. In contrast, both the precursor and processed forms of /?-lactamase proteins synthesized by chain-terminating mutants (including one which lacks only loo / of its residues from the carboxy end) are not secreted and apparently remain soluble in the cytoplasm. These {{results show that the}} <b>carboxy-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> sequence (at least) of /Llactamase is essential to successful transport across the cytoplasmic membrane, and suggest that the presence (and probably also the act of removal) of the signal sequence does not suffice to ensure secretion...|$|E
40|$|The prostanoid prostacyclin, or {{prostaglandin}} I 2, {{plays an}} essential role in many aspects of cardiovascular disease. The actions of prostacyclin are mainly mediated through its activation of the prostacyclin receptor or, in short, the IP. In recent studies, the cytoplasmic carboxy-terminal domain of the IP was shown to bind several PDZ domains of the multi-PDZ adaptor PDZK 1. The interaction between the two proteins was found to enhance cell surface expression of the IP and to be functionally important in promoting prostacyclin-induced endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis. To investigate the interaction of the IP with the first PDZ domain (PDZ 1) of PDZK 1, we generated a nine residue peptide (KK 411 IAACSLC 417) containing the seven <b>carboxy-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> of the IP and measured its binding affinity to a recombinant protein corresponding to PDZ 1 by isothermal titration calorimetry. We determined that the IP interacts with PDZ 1 with a binding affinity of 8. 2 mM. Using the same technique, we also determined that the farnesylated form of carboxy-terminus of the IP does not bind to PDZ 1. To understand the molecular basis of these findings, we solved the high resolution crystal structure of PDZ 1 bound to a 7 -residue peptide derived from the carboxy-terminus of the non-farnesylated form of IP (411 IAACSLC 417). Analysis of the structure demonstrates a critical role for the three <b>carboxy-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> in establishing a strong interaction with PDZ 1 and explains the inability of the farnesylated form of IP to interact with the PDZ 1 domain of PDZK 1 a...|$|R
40|$|The {{role of the}} <b>carboxy-terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> of the {{bacteriophage}} SPO 1 -encoded type II DNA-binding protein, TF 1, in DNA binding was analyzed. Chain-terminating mutations truncating {{the normally}} 99 -amino-acid TF 1 at <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> 96, 97, and 98 were constructed, as were missense mutations substituting cysteine, arginine, and serine for phenylalanine at <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> 97 and tryptophan for lysine at <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> 99. The binding of the resulting proteins to a synthetic 44 -bp binding site in 5 -(hydroxymethyl) uracil DNA, to binding sites in larger SPO 1 [5 -(hydroxymethyl) uracil-containing] DNA fragments, and to thymine-containing homologous DNA was analyzed by gel retardation and also by DNase I and hydroxy radical footprinting. We conclude that the C tail {{up to and including}} phenylalanine at <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> 97 is essential for DNA binding and that the two C-terminal <b>amino</b> <b>acids,</b> 98 and 99, are involved in protein-protein interactions between TF 1 dimers bound to DNA...|$|R
