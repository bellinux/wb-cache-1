40|$|Micromolar {{concentrations}} of <b>cis-fatty</b> <b>acid</b> synergistically activate type III protein kinase C with diacylglycerol. This synergistic effect occurs at low {{concentrations of}} <b>cis-fatty</b> <b>acid</b> and diacylglycerol, {{and it is}} capable of inducing almost full activation of this protein kinase C subtype at a physiologically relevant Ca 2 + concentration (2 microM). The synergistic activation mode can be observed {{even in the absence of}} Ca 2 +, but micromolar Ca 2 + significantly enhances the type III protein kinase C activation. <b>cis-Fatty</b> <b>acid</b> also augments the diacylglycerol-induced activation of other subtypes (type I and II), although the effect is smaller than that observed in type III. Neither the diacylglycerol- nor the cis-fatty acid-dependent mode of activation can fully activate any of these subtypes at a physiological concentration of Ca 2 + (2 microM). Our results suggest that the generation of three second messengers, i. e. the increase in intracellular Ca 2 + concentration and the generation of both <b>cis-fatty</b> <b>acid</b> and diacylglycerol in the cell, may be necessary signals for protein kinase C activation, particularly for type III protein kinase C...|$|E
40|$|A {{long-chain}} neutral phospholipid, dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, {{was found}} to support protein kinase C activation by <b>cis-fatty</b> <b>acid</b> and diacylglycerol (DAG). This effect of phosphatidylcholine (PC) is totally dependent {{on the presence of}} cis-fatty acid; PC greatly stimulates the cis-fatty acid-induced protein kinase C activity, but it does not activate protein kinase C at all, even in the presence of DAG, if <b>cis-fatty</b> <b>acid</b> is absent. DAG, however, plays a modulatory role in the presence of Ca 2 +; it further enhances the PC-potentiated <b>cis-fatty</b> <b>acid</b> activation of protein kinase C. Although the activities of all three protein kinase C subtypes tested (types I, II and III) are supported by this PC mechanism, type III is most sensitive to the DAG effect, and it is activated synergistically by <b>cis-fatty</b> <b>acid</b> and DAG. The potency of PC to support the synergistic activation of this subtype is equivalent to that of phosphatidylserine (PS). There are several differences, however, between PC- and PS-supported synergism observed in type III protein kinase C: (1) Ca(2 +) -sensitivity is different; PC requires higher concentrations of Ca 2 + (10 - 20 microM-Ca 2 +) than those required for PS (micromolar Ca 2 +); (2) PC/cis-fatty acid/DAG-induced autophosphorylation of protein kinase C subtypes (types I, II and III) is very weak, whereas PS/cis-fatty acid/DAG strongly stimulate autophosphorylation of these subtypes under the conditions at which both PC and PS systems fully activate the protein kinase C in terms of histone phosphorylation. These observations suggest that a neutral phospholipid such as PC may also participate in the activation and differential regulation of protein kinase C...|$|E
40|$|Upon {{a sudden}} {{addition}} of toluene to soil (10 % vol/wt) {{a significant proportion}} (about 1 %) of the soil indigenous bacteria survived, the survival ones recolonized the soil to reach a high cell density. Two bacterial strains called MTB 5 and MTB 6, which use toluene as the sole carbon and energy source, were isolated from the soil polluted with this large amount of toluene after 15 days incubation. The strains were taxonomically identified as Pseudomonas putida sensu stricto based on 16 S rRNA sequences. Another strain (P. putida R 1) isolated from a biofilm washed with toluene-polluted waters was also studied regarding toluene degradation and toluene tolerance. All three strains used the toluene dioxygenase pathway for toluene metabolism. Strain P. putida MTB 6 was able to grow on liquid medium with 10 % (vol/vol) toluene, whereas the other two strains did not grow at concentrations of toluene higher than 0. 1 % (vol/vol).

After exposure to aromatic hydrocarbons, all three strains isomerized the <b>cis-fatty</b> <b>acid</b> lipids C 16 : 1 ω 9 and C 18 : 1 ω 11 to their trans isomers. This change led to the rigidification of the cell membrane.

The <b>cis-fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were more readily incorporated into triglycerides than phospholipids, the reverse being true of the trans-fatty acids.

The PKC inhibitor, 1 -O-hexadecyl- 2 -O-methyl-glycerol, inhibited PMN lipid body formation induced by oleic and arachidonic acids and by 1 -oleoyl- 2 -acetyl-glycerol and phorbol myristate acetate. Other PKC inhibitors (staurosporine, H- 7) also inhibited lipid body formation.

40|$|The C 2 domain {{in protein}} kinase C (PKC) is {{homologous}} to equivalent domains {{in a number}} of important cytoplasmic proteins. Except for its implied function in Ca 2 + and phospholipid binding, the precise role of this domain is not well understood. We examined the role of the C 2 domain of PKC-alpha using a mutant enzyme in which 80 % of this domain has been deleted. This mutant can be activated by phospholipid and diacylglycerol, but is independent of Ca 2 +. In this regard, its characteristics {{are similar to those of}} the novel PKCs (nPKCs), consistent with the notion that the C 2 domain of PKC confers its Ca 2 + responsiveness. However, when the C 2 deletion mutant is activated by cis-unsaturated fatty acid, the activity is strongly inhibited by Ca 2 + at micromolar concentrations. The Ca 2 + inhibition is dose-dependent and is specific to cis-unsaturated fatty acids. The deletion mutant can also be activated synergistically by diacylglycerol and <b>cis-fatty</b> <b>acid,</b> but again activation is inhibited by Ca 2 +. Our results indicate that a PKC lacking the C 2 domain is Ca 2 +-responsive and there exists an additional site for Ca 2 + that modulates the sensitivity of the enzyme to cis-unsaturated fatty acid but not to diacylglycerol. This modulatory Ca 2 +-binding site appears to be suppressed by the C 2 domain because the presence of the domain reverses the direction of PKC activity induced by cis-unsaturated fatty acid. These results suggest that the modulatory Ca 2 +-binding site could act as a molecular switch selective for fatty acid activation by sensing the changes in the Ca 2 + levels in a cell, serving a possible mechanism of differential activation of cPKC with a C 2 domain and nPKC lacking this domain...|$|E

40|$|Lipid bodies, cytoplasmic {{inclusions}} {{that develop}} in cells associated with inflammation, are inducible structures that might participate in generating inflammatory eicosanoids. Cis-unsaturated fatty acids (arachidonic and oleic acids) rapidly induced lipid body formation in leukocytes, and this lipid body induction was inhibited by aspirin and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Several findings {{indicates that the}} inhibitory effect of aspirin and NSAIDs on lipid body formation was independent of cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition. First, the non-COX inhibitor, sodium salicylate, was as potent as aspirin in inhibiting lipid body formation elicited by <b>cis-fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> Second, <b>cis-fatty</b> acid-induced lipid body formation was not impaired in macrophages from COX- 1 or COX- 2 genetically deficient mice. Finally, NSAIDs inhibited arachidonic acid-induced lipid body formation likewise in macrophages from wild-type and COX- 1 - and COX- 2 -deficient mice. An enhanced capacity to generate eicosanoids developed after 1 hr concordantly with cis-fatty acid-induced lipid body formation. Arachidonic and oleic acid-induced lipid body numbers correlated with the enhanced levels of leukotrienes B 4 and C 4 and prostaglandin E 2 produced after submaximal calcium ionophore stimulation. Aspirin and NSAIDs inhibited both induced lipid body formation and the enhanced capacity for forming leukotrienes as well as prostaglandins. Our studies indicate that lipid body formation is an inducible early response in leukocytes that correlates with enhanced eicosanoid synthesis. Aspirin and NSAIDs, independent of COX inhibition, inhibit cis-fatty acid-induced lipid body formation in leukocytes and in concert inhibit the enhanced synthesis of leukotrienes and prostaglandins...|$|R
40|$|Information on milk {{production}} {{could be useful}} in designing strategies that would help to improve {{milk production}} in communal farming systems. This {{study was conducted to}} determine milk production and calf performance of Nguni and crossbreds under smallholder cattle production conditions. Four trials were conducted in the study. The objective of the first trial was to determine farmer perceptions on milk production and calf rearing in smallholder areas. Data were obtained from 218 smallholder farmers, using a structured questionnaire. Smallholder farmer sector is constituted by small scale commercial farmers and communal farmers. Small-scale commercial farmers in South Africa obtained farms from the government through land claims or they bought the farms. Their farming background is a communal type. Communal farmers are farmers that are sharing the same grazing land and animals are managed according to the experience of the owner. The findings in this study indicated that there were numerous constraints to milk production in smallholder areas. These included lack of technical expertise and poor veterinary support services. The farmers also indicated that calf performance was low. The second trial was conducted to determine if there were differences in calf performance, gastrointestinal parasites and nutritionally-related blood metabolites between Nguni and crossbred calves. Body weights and faecal samples were collected monthly until weaning at six months. The levels of total protein, albumin, globulins, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), glucose, cholesterol and minerals were determined monthly. Nguni calves had higher birth weights than crossbreds (P 0. 05). Milk was utilised as both fresh and sour. Fresh milk was utilised with tea/coffee and porridge. Excess fresh milk was utilised to feed pets (mostly cats and puppies). The puppies were fed on mostly whey, and, at times, on fresh milk. Sour milk was utilised to prepare of umvubo (a mixture of sour milk and scrambled porridge (umphokoqo) or a mixture of sour milk and bread). In some cases, excess milk was given to neighbours as a form of social investment and fame. The quality of milk from Nguni and crossbred cows was compared in the fourth trial. Milk samples were evaluated for quality in early (February), mid (April) and late (June) lactation in 2009. The essential amino acids, non-essential amino acids and fatty acids were determined. Nguni milk had higher amino acids and fatty acids concentration than crossbreds (P< 0. 05). Nguni milk had higher arginine levels in the early and mid lactation periods compared to crossbred cows (P< 0. 05). Nguni milk had higher methionine and threonine levels than crossbred cows (P< 0. 05). Methionine levels in Nguni were 0. 15, 0. 19 and 0. 18 in early, mid and late lactation while crossbred had 0. 05, 0. 05 and 0. 06 (g/ 100 ml), respectively. There were significant interactions between lactation stage and genotype for lysine levels with Nguni milk having higher (P< 0. 05) lysine levels in the mid and late lactation periods. Nguni cows had higher tyrosine, glycine and proline levels than crossbred cows (P< 0. 05). In the early lactation, Nguni cows had higher serine levels than crossbred cows (P< 0. 05). In mid lactation crossbred cows had higher serine levels than Nguni cows (P< 0. 05). There were significant differences between genotypes on fatty acid composition. Nguni milk had higher C 12 : 0 levels than crossbreds (P< 0. 05). However, milk from crossbred cows had higher C 14 : 0 levels than that for Nguni cows (P< 0. 05) and also had higher levels of C 16 : 0 and C 18 : 0 fatty acids compared to Nguni cows. Crossbred milk had higher levels of C 18 n 1 n 9 t in early lactation period than Nguni and decreased as the stage of lactation progressed (P< 0. 05). In the early lactation, the levels of C 18 n 1 nC in Nguni milk were higher (P< 0. 05) than in late lactation. In the mid and late lactation, crossbred cows milk had higher C 18 n 1 nC levels than in early lactation (P< 0. 05). Lactation stage and genotype affected saturated fatty, monounsaturated fatty <b>acids,</b> <b>cis-fatty</b> <b>acids</b> and omega 3 (n- 3) to omega 6 (n- 6). In general, Nguni milk had higher mineral composition than crossbred milk (P< 0. 05). In conclusion, Nguni calves performed better than crossbred calves under communal rangelands. There is a need for crossing Nguni cows with dairy breeds in commercial dairying by smalhoder farmers as a strategy for improving both milk quality and quantity...|$|R
