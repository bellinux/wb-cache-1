This was down from the previous year's attendance of 18,065, but the decline <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> the smaller size of the venue for WrestleMania XI. The attendance figure was also lower than the following year's figure of 18,852 fans at WrestleMania XII. The pay-per-view buyrate for WrestleMania XI was 1.3, which was lower than the 1.68 buyrate for WrestleMania X but higher than the 1.2 buyrate for WrestleMania XII.|$|E
5|$|Many Japanese-Palauans assumed key {{positions}} in the public service sector and politics. At least one ethnologist, Mark Peattie, suggested that the strong representation of Japanese-Palauans in leading positions in society <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> the mainstream Japanese education which they had received in their youth. Palau's first president, Kuniwo Nakamura—who was half-Japanese—fostered closer diplomatic ties between Japan and Palau during his Presidency. During a state visit to Japan in 1996, Emperor Akihito personally received Nakamura, and the visit was commended by Palauans and Japanese alike. Nakamura's visit prompted Japan to channel monetary aid to Palau to facilitate repair work on the Koror-Babeldaob Bridge and securing special trade agreements with Japan.|$|E
5|$|Otjes's {{approach}} is more empirical {{than that of}} many contributors to Political Animals and Animal Politics. He examines the Dutch Party for the Animals (PvdD), which, in 2006, won two seats in the House of Representatives. Otjes explores whether the PvdD's presence has changed {{the amount of time}} more established parties spent on animal issues by examining both parliamentary speeches and motions before and after the introduction of the PvdD members. He finds that established parties began to talk more about animal issues in 2006, and that this <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> conflict between the PvdD and the established parties. Though Otjes allows that his study's relevance may seem limited, he concludes that smaller parties can affect government agenda by remaining focused on their own primary concern.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} the subject began with the {{development}} in the 19th century of wave mechanics and the exploration of phenomena associated with the Doppler effect. The effect is named after Christian Doppler, who offered the first known physical explanation for the phenomenon in 1842. The hypothesis was tested and confirmed for sound waves by the Dutch scientist Christophorus Buys Ballot in 1845. Doppler correctly predicted that the phenomenon should apply to all waves, and in particular suggested that the varying colors of stars <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> their motion {{with respect to the}} Earth. Before this was verified, however, it was found that stellar colors were primarily due to a star's temperature, not motion. Only later was Doppler vindicated by verified redshift observations.|$|E
5|$|New {{polls in}} January {{indicated}} voter support was growing for Toomey, who now held a projected nine percentage point lead over Specter and an eight-point lead over Sestak. Specter continued to lead against Sestak in the Democratic primary poll, {{this time by}} a 21-point margin. Some political scientists believed Toomey's gain over Specter <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> voter distrust of establishment candidates and growing dissatisfaction {{with the health care}} proposal pending in Congress. However, some Democratic leaders felt Sestak's challenge to Specter was having a detrimental effect not only to Specter, but to the Democratic party in general and their prospects for ultimately winning the general election. This feeling was enhanced by the growing national support for the Republican party, and especially by the unexpected victory of the Tea Party-backed Republican Scott Brown in a special election for a traditionally Democratic Massachusetts Senate seat. Specter acknowledged to The New York Times that the national political mood might work against him in the primary, but insisted he was not discouraged and expressed confidence in his ability to survive.|$|E
5|$|To preempt the {{traditional}} wet season offensive in 1969, the Air Force approved a major offensive bombing campaign within Barrel Roll named Operation Raindance. It was timed {{to coincide with}} spoiling operations that Vang Pao had planned against the Plain of Jars. The operation began on 17 March and launched 80 strikes per day for 12 days. Raindance was extended through 7 April, by which time 730 U.S. sorties had been flown. On 22 May the Air Force conducted Operation Stranglehold, a five-day campaign focused on Routes 6 and 7, PAVN's logistical lifeline. Regardless, the North Vietnamese launched Campaign Thoan Thang (Total Victory) during late June and managed to take Muang Soui {{with the assistance of}} armoured units. A total of 103 Air Force and 44 RLAF strikes were flown in the defense of the town, but to no avail. Part of the PAVN success <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> the record number of its units then available in the northeast. Seven new battalions having arrived since April.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{was being}} {{pressured}} by the divisional commander {{to increase the speed}} of the advance, Whitehead was said to be reasonably happy with the progress being made by the 2/48th along the central route, although he had misgivings about the performance of the 2/23rd on the left and the 2/24th on the right. To some extent, the failure of the 2/24th to take the 2,200 feature <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> the importance which the Japanese commander, Katagiri, placed upon its defence, however, Whitehead believed that the battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Gillespie, was procrastinating and being overly cautious in his tactics. Nevertheless, it was later realised that the terrain which the 2/24th faced was more formidable than first thought, and that in order for the battalion to make progress, they too, like the 2/48th, would need tanks. Some attempt was made by the Australians to bring these up from the rear areas, but ultimately the fighting around Sattelberg came to an end before this could be effected. On the brigade's left, south of the main route, the pace of the 2/23rd's advance had also caused Whitehead some concern. Indeed, Whitehead went as far to express this to the 2/23rd's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Tucker, who pointed out that his lack of progress had been caused by the large number of tasks that the battalion had been assigned, namely the competing demands to secure the flank while attempting to move quickly through broken country in order to make its scheduled rendezvous with the 2/48th.|$|E
5|$|The macOS client debuted on June 23, 2015 to {{coincide}} with the release of the first expansion pack. The port was handled by TransGaming. Unlike console and Microsoft Windows PC versions of the expansion, the Mac release is only available in a two-in-one bundle containing the base game and the Heavensward expansion, titled Final Fantasy XIV Online. Current players of other versions of the game, including Mac players running the PC version via Boot Camp, are required to purchase this bundle in order to play using the native Mac client. On July 3, 2015, Square Enix suspended sales of the Mac version because of widespread reports of poor technical performance and offered refunds to those who purchased it. Yoshida observed that the performance issues <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> difficulties in transposing the game from Microsoft's proprietary DirectX graphical rendering libraries to OpenGL as well as a clerical error resulting in publishing the wrong minimum system requirements, both compounded by the hectic work schedule demanded by the release of an expansion pack. After new rounds of testing and optimization, sales of the Mac version resumed on February 23, 2016, accompanying the release of Patch 3.2.|$|E
