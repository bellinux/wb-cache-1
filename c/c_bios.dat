40|$|Cyanobacteria {{respond to}} {{environmental}} stress conditions by adjusting their photosynthesis machinery. In Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942, phycobilisome degradation and other acclimation responses after nutrient or high-light stress require activation by the orphan response regulator NblR, {{a member of}} the OmpR/PhoB family. Although NblR contains a putative phosphorylatable residue (Asp 57), it lacks other conserved residues required to chelate the Mg 2 + necessary for aspartic acid phosphorylation or to transduce the phosphorylation signal. In close agreement with these features, NblR was not phosphorylated in vitro by the low-molecular-mass phosphate donor acetyl phosphate and mutation of Asp 57 to Ala had no impact on previously characterized NblR functions in Synechococcus. On the other hand, in vitro and in vivo assays show that the default state of NblR is monomeric, suggesting that, despite input differences, NblR activation could involve the same general mechanism of activation by dimerization present in known members of the OmpR/PhoB family. Structural and functional data indicate that the receiver domain of NblR shares similarities with other phosphorylation-independent response regulators such as FrzS and HP 1043.

40|$|To attain {{its native}} conformation, the cytoskeletal protein tubulin needs the {{concourse}} of several molecular chaperones, among others the cytosolic chaperonin CCT. It {{has been previously}} described that denatured tubulin interacts with CCT in a quasi-folded conformation using several loops located throughout its sequence. These loops are also involved in microtubule formation and are absent in its prokaryote homologue FtsZ, which in vitro folds by itself and does not interact with CCT. Several FtsZ/tubulin chimeric proteins were generated by inserting consecutively one, {{two or three of}} the CCT-binding domains of tubulin into the corresponding sequence of FtsZ from Methanococccus jannaschii. The insertion of any of the CCT-binding loops generates in the FtsZ/tubulin chimeras the ability to interact with CCT. The accumulation of CCT-binding loops induces in the FtsZ/tubulin chimeras unfolding and refolding properties that are more similar to tubulin than to its prokaryote counterpart. Finally, the insertion of some of these loops generates in the FtsZ/tubulin chimeras more complex polymeric structures than those found for FtsZ. These results reinforce the notion that CCT has coevolved with tubulin to deal with the folding problems encountered by the eukaryotic protein with the appearance of the new sequences involved in microtubule formation. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Short sediment cores were taken at 550 m and at 1366 m water depth, within 3600 m offshore Cape Ivanovskii at the station of the Baikal Deep Underwater NEUTRINO Telescope. The sediments within 3600 m off the northern coast of Southern Lake Baikal are dominated by pelagic deposition. Our data reveal surprisingly little influence from terrigenous material from adjacent coastal areas, tributaries and their catchment. At the shallow-water site (at 550 m water depth, 700 m off shore) just 27 cm thick homogenous sediments have accumulated during the Holocene on top of Pleistocene deposits resulting in Holocene sedimentation rates of 0. 003 cm a - 1. The very low rates are caused by long-term persistent winnowing of fine particles caused by week contour currents along the slope. The uppermost sediments are oxidized down to 22 cm. Very low concentrations of <b>C</b> org, Si <b>bio</b> and N tot in Pleistocene sediments increase dramatically within the Holocene. The heavy mineral fraction of the shallow-water sediments contains up to 33. 6 % olivine and up to 2. 4 % spinel. These rare minerals originate from white marbles of the nearby coastal outcrop Belaya Vyemka of the Early Precambrian Sharyzalgaiskaya Series. At the deep-water site (at 1366 m water depth, 3600 m off shore) Holocene sedimentation rates are 10 -times higher (0. 036 cm a - 1). Sediment oxidation occurs just within the uppermost 2 cm. Of the two rare type minerals of the Sharyzalgaiskaya Series spinel does not occur at all and olivine is represented by very diminished concentrations.

40|$|Conjugative {{coupling}} proteins (CPs) {{are proposed}} {{to play a}} role in connecting the relaxosome to a type IV secretion system (T 4 SS) during bacterial conjugation. Here we present biochemical and genetic evidence indicating that the prototype CP, TrwB, interacts with both relaxosome and type IV secretion components of plasmid R 388. The cytoplasmic domain of TrwB immobilized in an affinity resin retained TrwC and TrwA proteins, the components of R 388 relaxosome. By using the bacterial two-hybrid system, a strong interaction was detected between TrwB and TrwE, a core component of the conjugative T 4 SS. This interaction was lost when the transmembrane domains of either TrwB or TrwE were deleted, thus suggesting that it takes place within the membrane or periplasmic portions of both proteins. We have also analyzed the interactions with components of the related IncN plasmid pKM 101. Its CP, TraJ, did not interact with TrwA, suggesting a highly specific interaction with the relaxosome. On the other side, CPs from three different conjugation systems were shown to interact with both their cognate TrwE-like component and the heterologous ones, suggesting that this interaction is less specific. Mating experiments among the three systems confirmed that relaxosome components need their cognate CP for transfer, whereas T 4 SSs are interchangeable. As a general rule, there is a correlation between the strength of the interaction seen by two-hybrid analysis and the efficiency of transfer.

Structure-based comparisons suggest that evolution led to {{a small number of}} viral classes or lineages that can be grouped by capsid protein (CP) folds. Here, we report that the CP structure of the fungal dsRNA Penicillium chrysogenum virus (PcV) shows the progenitor fold of the dsRNA virus lineage and suggests a relationship between lineages. Cryo-EM structure at near-atomic resolution showed that the 982 -aa PcV CP is formed by a repeated α-helical core, indicative of gene duplication despite lack of sequence similarity between the two halves. Superimposition of secondary structure elements identified a single >hotspot> at which variation is introduced by insertion of peptide segments. Structural comparison of PcV and other distantly related dsRNA viruses detected preferential insertion sites at which the complexity of the conserved α-helical core, made up of ancestral structural motifs that have acted as a skeleton, might have increased, leading to evolution of the highly varied current structures.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{crystallinity}} {{of cellulose}} {{is a principal}} factor limiting the efficient hydrolysis of biomass to fermentable sugars or direct catalytic conversion to biofuel components. We evaluated the impact of TFA-induced gelatinization of crystalline cellulose on enhancement of enzymatic digestion and catalytic conversion to biofuel substrates. Results Low-temperature swelling of cotton linter cellulose in TFA at subzero temperatures followed by gentle heating to 55  °C dissolves the microfibril structure and forms composites of crystalline and amorphous gels upon addition of ethanol. The extent of gelatinization of crystalline cellulose was determined by reduction of birefringence in darkfield microscopy, loss of X-ray diffractability, and loss of resistance to acid hydrolysis. Upon freeze-drying, an additional degree of crystallinity returned as mostly cellulose II. Both enzymatic digestion with a commercial cellulase cocktail and maleic acid/AlCl 3 -catalyzed conversion to 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural and levulinic acid were markedly enhanced with the low-temperature swollen cellulose. Only small improvements in rates and extent of hydrolysis and catalytic conversion were achieved upon heating to fully dissolve cellulose. Conclusions Low-temperature swelling of cellulose in TFA substantially reduces recalcitrance of crystalline cellulose to both enzymatic digestion and catalytic conversion. In a closed system to prevent loss of fluorohydrocarbons, the relative ease of recovery and regeneration of TFA by distillation makes it a potentially useful agent in large-scale deconstruction of biomass, not only for enzymatic depolymerization but also for enhancing rates of catalytic conversion to biofuel components and useful bio-products.

The {{aim of this study}} was to distinguish between biogenic (BIO) and physicogenic (PHYS) aggregates in various states of fragmentation or size classes using visual, physical and chemical characteristics. Casts produced by Amynthas khami (BIO) and surrounding soil aggregates without visible biological activity (PHYS) were left to disaggregate by natural rainfall events and then separated into five size classes of > 10, 10 – 5, 5 – 2, 2 – 0. 5 and < 0. 5 mm. We then analysed aggregate morphology, elemental and stable isotope composition and soil stability, and used near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to determine their chemical characteristics. Although visual assessment is the method most commonly used in the field to distinguish between BIO and PHYS, our study found that the results obtained were always prone to error and that the classification was arbitrary for BIO and PHYS aggregates smaller than 5 and 2 mm in size, respectively. Soil structural stability was only useful for identifying BIO aggregates larger than 2 mm. While C content and δ 13 <b>C</b> in <b>BIO</b> were always different from PHYS, regardless of soil aggregate size, N content and δ 15 N were similar. NIRS was the most effective method because it clearly discriminated soil aggregates on the basis of size and origin. The NIRS characteristics of BIO were also more uniform than those of PHYS, suggesting that BIO aggregates have a simpler organization and as a consequence more homogeneous ecological functions. Thus, our findings suggest that information may be lost when only the physical aspect of aggregates is used to quantify the activity of ecosystem engineers in soil. After fragmentation, BIO aggregates become hidden and although it may be impossible to distinguish them visually from PHYS aggregates they retain some of their specific chemical characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Genome-wide {{expression}} analyses {{have provided}} clues on how Salmonella proliferates inside cultured macrophages and epithelial cells. However, in vivo {{studies show that}} Salmonella does not replicate massively within host cells, leaving the underlying mechanisms of such growth control largely undefined. In vitro infection models based on fibroblasts or dendritic cells reveal limited proliferation of the pathogen, but it is presently unknown whether these phenomena reflect events occurring in vivo. Fibroblasts are distinctive, since they represent a nonphagocytic cell type in which S. enterica serovar Typhimurium actively attenuates intracellular growth. Here, we show in the mouse model that S. Typhimurium restrains intracellular growth within nonphagocytic cells positioned in the intestinal lamina propria. This response requires a functional PhoP-PhoQ system and is reproduced in primary fibroblasts isolated from the mouse intestine. The fibroblast infection model was exploited to generate transcriptome data, which revealed that 2 % (98 genes) of the S. Typhimurium genome is differentially expressed in nongrowing intracellular bacteria. Changes include metabolic reprogramming to microaerophilic conditions, induction of virulence plasmid genes, upregulation of the pathogenicity islands SPI- 1 and SPI- 2, and shutdown of flagella production and chemotaxis. Comparison of relative protein levels of several PhoP-PhoQ-regulated functions (PagN, PagP, and VirK) in nongrowing intracellular bacteria and extracellular bacteria exposed to diverse PhoP-PhoQ-inducing signals denoted a regulation responding to acidic pH. These data demonstrate that S. Typhimurium restrains intracellular growth in vivo and support a model in which dormant intracellular bacteria could sense vacuolar acidification to stimulate the PhoP-PhoQ system for preventing intracellular overgrowth.

SPI- 2 is required for survival of nongrowing bacteria persisting inside fibroblasts, but its induction mode and the effectors involved remain unknown. Here, we show that nongrowing dormant intracellular bacteria use the two-component system OmpR-EnvZ to induce SPI- 2 expression and the PhoP-PhoQ system to regulate the time at which induction takes place, 2 h postentry. Dormant bacteria were shown to discriminate the usage of SPI- 2 effectors. Among the effectors tested, SseF, SseG, and SseJ were required for survival, while others, such as SifA and SifB, were not. SifA and SifB dispensability correlated with the inability of intracellular bacteria to secrete these effectors even when overexpressed. Conversely, SseJ overproduction resulted in augmented secretion and exacerbated bacterial growth. Dormant bacteria produced other effectors, such as PipB and PipB 2, that, unlike what was reported for epithelial cells, did not to traffic outside the phagosomal compartment. Therefore, permissiveness for secreting only a subset of SPI- 2 effectors may be instrumental for dormancy. We propose that the S. enterica serovar Typhimurium nonproliferative intracellular lifestyle is sustained by selection of SPI- 2 effectors that are produced in tightly defined amounts and delivered to phagosome-confined locations. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

40|$|Bacterial {{conjugation}} is a promiscuous DNA transport mechanism. Conjugative plasmids transfer themselves between most bacteria, thus {{being one}} of the main causal agents of the spread of antibiotic resistance among pathogenic bacteria. Moreover, DNA can be transferred conjugatively into eukaryotic host cells. In this review, we aim to address several basic questions regarding the DNA transfer mechanism. Conjugation can be visualized as a DNA rolling-circle replication (RCR) system linked to a type IV secretion system (T 4 SS), the latter being macromolecular transporters widely involved in pathogenic mechanisms. The scheme 'replication + secretion' suggests how the mechanism would work on the DNA substrate and at the bacterial membrane. But, how do these two parts come into contact? Furthermore, how is the DNA transported? T 4 SS are known to be involved in protein secretion in different organisms, but DNA is a very different macromolecule. The so-called coupling proteins could be the answer to both questions by performing a dual role in conjugation: coupling the two main components of the machinery (RCR and T 4 SS) and actively mediating DNA transport. We postulate that the T 4 SS is responsible for transport of the pilot protein (the relaxase) to the recipient. The DNA that is covalently linked to it is initially transported in a passive manner, trailing on the relaxase. We speculate that the pilus appendage could work as a needle, thrusting the substrate proteins to cross one or several membrane barriers into the recipient cytoplasm. This {{is the first step in}} conjugation. The second step is the active pumping of the DNA to the recipient, using the already available T 4 SS transport conduit. It is proposed that this second step is catalysed by the coupling proteins. Our 'shoot and pump' model solves the protein-DNA transport paradox of T 4 SS.

We studied the range of N 265 TraA relaxase specificity in vitro by testing different oligonucleotides in binding and nicking assays. In addition, the ability of pRetCFN 42 d to mobilize different Rhizobiaceae plasmid origins of transfer (oriT) was examined. Data obtained with these approaches allowed us to establish functional and phylogenetic relationships between different plasmids of this family.

40|$|Horizontal {{transfer}} of antibiotic resistance genes carried by conjugative plasmids poses a serious health problem. As conjugative relaxases are transported to recipient cells during bacterial conjugation, we investigated whether blocking relaxase {{activity in the}} recipient cell might inhibit conjugation. For that purpose, we used an intrabody approach generating a single-chain Fv antibody library against the relaxase TrwC of conjugative plasmid R 388. Recombinant single-chain Fv antibodies were engineered for cytoplasmic expression in Escherichia coli cells and either selected in vitro for their specific binding to TrwC, or in vivo by their ability to interfere with conjugation using a high-throughput mating assay. Several intrabody clones were identified showing specific inhibition against R 388 conjugation upon cytoplasmic expression in the recipient cell. The epitope recognized by one of these intrabodies was mapped to a region of TrwC containing Tyr- 26 and involved in the conjugative DNA-processing termination reaction. These findings demonstrate that the transferred relaxase {{plays an important role}} in the recipient cell and open a new approach to identify specific inhibitors of bacterial conjugation. © 2006 The Authors.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} has been {{to look at the}} thermal {{behaviour}} of anthracite, coke and charcoal regarding their expansion during heating and their release of off-gases. Furthermore, to look at how the porosity and expansion of the anthracite is affected by the different temperatures during the calcining process. Two anthracites (A 11 and A 19), two cokes (C 3 and C 7) and one charcoal (BIO) were investigated. The porosity and surface area of A 11 calcined at different temperatures were investigated by porosity calculations from envelope and absolute density measurements, and from BET surface area measurements with N 2 gas adsorption. The porosity of A 11 was found to decrease with increasing calcining temperature up to 1800 C and increase between 1800 and 2650 C. A significant difference in the surface area from 27. 4 to 0. 2 m^ 2 /g was found between the materials calcined at 600 and 1100 C, while an incremental increase was observed between 1100 and 2650 C. The high surface area of the non-calcined A 11 and A 11 calcined at 600 C can be explain the high porosity for these temperature samples. Single grains of A 11 calcined at 1100, 1800 and 2650 C were heated to 1550 C in a pushrod dilatometer in order to investigate the thermal expansion. The thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) was found to decrease with increasing calcining temperature. Both the material calcined at 1800 and 2650 C had a TEC close to the TEC of graphite of about 3 * 10 ^- 6 /C, indicating graphitization. The material calcined at 1100 C showed a higher TEC value of 15 * 10 ^- 6 /C. The thermal expansion was also investigated with an Exstar SS 6300 TMA, using pelletized material. Two heating cycles to 1400 C were carried out. A shrinkage was found during the first heating above 600 C due to volatiles leaving the carbon matrix. A linear relationship between the TEC from the first heating and the volatile content of the samples were found. The non-calcined A 11 and A 11 calcined at 600, 800 and 1000 C revealed a trend where the shrinkage decrease with increasing calcining temperature. A linear relationship between the shrinkage and the volatile content was found in the temperature range where volatiles are driven off. Similar shrinkage was observed for the non-calcined A 19, A 19 calcined at 600 C, <b>C</b> 7 and <b>BIO.</b> For the second heating all materials were found to contract the same amount during cooling as they expand during heating. The expansion at 1400 C was found to be between 0. 6 and 0. 9 % for all samples. For C 3 and the anthracites calcined at 1200 C or higher, no shrinkage occurred. The expansion was found to be similar for both temperature cycles, with only a small decrease in the average TEC values between the first and the second heating. The TEC values during the second heating were found to be very stable between 400 and 1100 C. For all samples the TEC values were found to lay between 5 and 8 * 10 ^- 6 /C, indicating graphitization. A high reproducibility was found for the thermal behaviour experiments carried out in the Exstar SS 6300 TMA. Mass loss and the derivative of mass during heating to 1500 C was investigated for all samples by using an STA 449 F 3 Jupiter and an Elite tube furnace. The STA was found to be more accurate and the results are reproducible. The mass loss of A 11 and A 19 during heating to 1500 C comply with the mass losses during the calcining process. The derivative of mass curves showed the highest increase around 600 - 700 C for all samples. The increase was found to be higher for A 19 than for A 11 samples due to the higher volatile content. The off-gases during heating of all samples were investigated by connecting a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) detector and a gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to the STA. The FTIR spectra showed CO 2, CO and H 2 O for all samples except C 3, where only CO 2 and CO were detected. From the GC-MS analysis, only CO 2 was detected and these results correlates with the FTIR analysis. The amount of CO 2 was found to increase with increasing temperature for all samples, and the highest amount of CO 2 was found for BIO. CO appears around 700 C and the amount was found to increase with increasing temperature. The FTIR spectra also indicated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons around 600 - 700 C for the non-calcined anthracites, A 19 calcined at 600 <b>C</b> and <b>BIO.</b> Finally, a multiple linear regression analysis was carried out to suggest correlations between different properties, how they affect each other and how they are affected by the thermal treatment. A root mean square error of zero was obtained for the total porosity of A 11 with an optimum equation containing the hydrogen content, the ash content and the BET surface area. Similar results were obtained for the dimensional behaviour of the anthracites during the first heating to 1400 C by including the sulfur, volatile and ash content in the equation...|$|R
30|$|Generally speaking, {{owing to}} the {{continuous}} development and improvement of PCR technique, the cloning of a gene with known nucleotide sequence is relatively easy. Comparatively, protein expression and purification are more difficult because they involve many issues, such as the selection of optimal expression organism, high efficiency expression vector, most appropriate growth condition, efficient purification strategy, etc., which in turn depend on the protein characteristics and downstream requirements (Ferrer-Miralles et al. 2015). The production of soluble and functional recombinant proteins is among the goals in the heterologous expression field. In the present work, we used a fusion expression vector (pCold TF) newly developed by Takara Bio Inc. (Shiga, Japan). pCold TF is a fusion cold shock expression vector that expresses trigger factor chaperone as a soluble fusion tag. This vector provides cold shock technology for high yield protein expression, combined with TF to facilitate correct protein folding (Saini et al. 2014; Qing et al. 2004). Our experimental results showed that Rab 3 A fusion protein was indeed efficiently expressed using pCold TF vector (Fig.  2). Furthermore, Rab 3 A fusion protein was efficiently purified in a single Ni-affinity purification step. Nevertheless, when we used thrombin to cleave the fusion protein, {{we found that the}} enzyme could not completely cleave the fusion protein even at higher concentrations. However, the data that Takara provided indicated that thrombin could almost completely remove the tag sequence of enzyme protein <b>C</b> fusion protein (<b>Bio</b> View Takara Bio Europe Edition), suggesting that the experimental conditions for the tag sequence removal of TF fusion proteins are dependent on the properties of the fusion proteins. Besides, Factor Xa was also tentatively used to cleave the fusion protein. However, the effect was found to be worse than that using thrombin (data not shown). Furthermore, when we tried to use Ni-affinity purification to separate the cleaved tag sequence as well as uncleaved fusion protein from the de-tagged Rab 3 A, we found that the purification efficiency was very limited, as it was hardly to obtain pure de-tagged Rab 3 A from the protein mixture, although we had made much effort on the optimization of experimental conditions (data not shown). It was speculated that the changes in the conformation of the tag sequences impeded their His tag binding to the agarose beads. In addition, gel filtration and RP-HPLC (using C 4 column) were also tentatively employed to purify the de-tagged Rab 3 A protein, and, however, they all failed. Finally, the gel protein recovery strategy using a Micro Protein PAGE Recovery Kit was employed to recover the de-tagged Rab 3 A protein after SDS-PAGE. Using this method, the pure Rab 3 A protein can be easily obtained, although it is usually difficult to prepare large amounts of the sample. Fortunately, due {{to the development of the}} techniques in protein chemistry, many analyses based on micro amounts of sample have become possible. It is worth mentioning that it is better not to use reducing reagents such as DTT to treat protein sample before SDS-PAGE and not to fix the gel after SDS-PAGE, which is in favor of renaturation and extraction of the protein of interest. Furthermore, preparative gel electrophoresis can be used to enlarge the scale of sample preparation, and Native-PAGE would be helpful to produce Rab 3 A of higher quality.|$|R
