40|$|Low-sensitivity {{switched}} <b>capacitor</b> <b>filters</b> imitating 'R','L' and 'C' can be {{built by}} means of capacitances, ordinary switches and voltage inverter switches (VIS). These structures carry the inherent bilinear transformation of their doubly resistively terminated ladder reference filters. This one to one correspondence between the 's-domain' and the 'z-domain' results in the Nyquist criterion being the only limitation on the sampling frequency. This eliminates the necessity for oversampling and VIS filters can be designed for high operating rates. Filters based on VIS principle were analysed in previous literatures in the 'phi-domain'. In this thesis work, a successful attempt {{has been made to}} formulate an analysis procedure for discrete-time filters based on VIS principle in the 'z-domain'. Significant details have been brought out in comparison with the respective reference filter. A fifth-order lowpass filter has been designed and implemented to exhibit the closeness to the bilinearly transformed continuous-time reference filter. Settling time analysis has been done to justify the need for filters using VIS principle as compared to the filters employing integrator based switched <b>capacitor</b> <b>filter.</b> It is shown that VIS filter can be made to settle within half the period required for a conventional integrator based switched <b>capacitor</b> <b>filter...</b>|$|R

40|$|Design of {{switched}} capacitor circuits in scaled CMOS technologies is becoming {{difficult because of}} low device intrinsic gain and reduced power supply voltage. To solve these problems, comparator-based switched-capacitor (CBSC) circuits and zero-crossing based circuits (ZCBC) were suggested as a possible solution to the op-amp based circuits. In this thesis, we explore zero-crossing based circuits (ZCBC) in high-order differential switched-capacitor filters to replace area inefficient op-amps-based continuous-time baseband filters. For the prototype for the zero-crossing based high-order switched <b>capacitor</b> <b>filter,</b> a low-pass ladder filter network will be used which is less sensitive to component variations. Several transformation steps from this low-pass passive ladder filter network to a differential high-order switched <b>capacitor</b> <b>filter</b> will be explored. To verify this architecture, SWITCAP will be used. And then ZCBC circuit implementation in Cadence will be explored. by Sungah Lee. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Lamp flicker levels which arise as {{a result}} of voltage {{fluctuations}} can exceed limits set by appropriate standards. New lamp types such as compact fluorescent lights (CFLs) are less sensitive to voltage fluctuations as their flicker characteristics are considerably different compared to those of the traditional incandescent lamp. These differences could support the moderation of the present voltage fluctuation and flicker standards and hence the associated limits. The potential detrimental effects on electrical equipment which may be caused by relaxation of these limits should be investigated before any changes to the present standards take place. The impact of voltage fluctuations on a fullbridge rectifier with a <b>capacitor</b> <b>filter</b> is considered as a case study in this paper. Such a circuit is found at the front end of many different types of equipment that are connected to the public AC supply network. The capacitor ripple current characteristic is of particular interest. The research reported in this paper indicates that the <b>filter</b> <b>capacitor</b> will accumulate and dissipate increased amount of charge when the rectifier is subjected to AC source voltage fluctuations. The consequence is that the RMS value of the capacitor current will increase where the magnitude of this increase is related to the modulation frequency and magnitude of the fluctuating voltage. Therefore, an AC supply with a voltage fluctuation component will cause a full-bridge rectifier with <b>capacitor</b> <b>filter</b> to sustain increased stress. This stress may accelerate the capacitor ageing process, eventually resulting in premature equipment failure. The research indicates {{that there is a need}} for indices other that the short-term and long-term flicker indices required for equipment compatibility levels...|$|R
