40|$|The use of {{low quality}} {{planting}} material {{is one of}} the major reasons for the limited success of past reforestation programs in the Philippines and elsewhere in the tropics. In the Philippines, a national policy has been in place since 2010, which regulates the quality <b>of</b> <b>seedlings.</b> As part <b>of</b> the policy, government reforestation programs are required to use only high quality seedlings from accredited seedling suppliers. A survey <b>of</b> nurseries producing <b>seedlings</b> for the National Greening Program in Eastern Visayas and Northern Mindanao regions was carried out to determine the effectiveness and challenges in implementing the forest nursery accreditation policy. The survey identified factors that limit the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>seedling</b> quality regulation including lack <b>of</b> auditing <b>of</b> <b>seedling</b> quality in accredited nurseries, insufficient monitoring <b>of</b> the <b>seedling</b> supply chain among the network <b>of</b> nurseries supplying <b>seedlings</b> for reforestation programs, inadequate seedling production schedules, and inappropriate criteria for seedling quality assessment. The limited sources of high quality germplasm, nursery operators’ limited information on the attributes of high quality planting materials and lack of knowledge about high quality seedling production technologies contributed to the widespread production <b>of</b> low quality <b>seedlings.</b> The lack <b>of</b> <b>seedling</b> quality checks makes the government’s bidding scheme <b>of</b> <b>seedling</b> purchases prone to favouring the proliferation <b>of</b> low quality <b>seedlings</b> that are usually sold at lower prices.

40|$|The {{quality of}} {{planting}} stock {{is a major}} factor in determining the success of tree farming. The survival of trees, growth performance, length of rotation period and volume and quality of timber that can be harvested from a plantation are greatly influenced by the quality <b>of</b> <b>seedlings</b> used. Seedlings raised in a nursery should be of high quality and the nursery operator should focus on raising high quality seedlings rather than on the number <b>of</b> <b>seedlings</b> produced. It is better to produce fewer <b>seedlings</b> <b>of</b> high quality rather than to produce many <b>seedlings</b> <b>of</b> low quality. Unfortunately, in the Philippines, private and government nurseries concentrate on the quantity rather than on improving the quality <b>of</b> <b>seedlings.</b> Seedling quality refers to genetic and physical properties. Genetic quality relates to the genetic characteristics of the source of germplasm, while physical quality refers to the physical condition <b>of</b> the <b>seedling</b> as it is raised in the nursery. The physical quality <b>of</b> <b>seedlings</b> can be improved by good practice within the nursery but there is no quick fix to improve seedling genetic quality. Producing <b>seedlings</b> <b>of</b> high physical quality can be carried out when the seedlings are in the nursery, while raising <b>seedlings</b> <b>of</b> high genetic quality requires the application of appropriate technologies prior to the production <b>of</b> <b>seedlings</b> in the nursery. Improving the seedling genetic quality requires a long-term process of mother tree selection and an appropriate germplasm collection procedure. This Q-seedling manual demonstrates and discusses the simple procedures and smallholder-based technologies for producing high quality seedlings or ‘Q-seedlings’. This manual is designed to assist nursery managers in improving the quality <b>of</b> <b>seedlings</b> they produce. The technologies included are taken from various sources including the research output of ACIAR-assisted project SST 96 / 110 Tree Production Technologies for the Philippines and Tropical Australia, research and development results of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), findings of recent nursery industry surveys in Leyte and Mindanao, and various publications on nursery seedling production...|$|R
