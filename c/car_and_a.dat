Since he was the only Dallas-based member of the press in camera car two, Grant directed his driver to the Trade Mart, where they saw no activity. A worker across the street said he saw a limousine speed past, accompanied by motorcycles with their sirens blaring; Grant knew immediately that they were headed to Parkland Memorial Hospital. Once at Parkland, Grant started snapping pictures of anything he could, including Vice President Johnson's <b>car,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> man and a police officer delivering what Grant believed was blood plasma.|$|E
5|$|London Underground {{has owned}} {{a small number}} of {{departmental}} vehicles which were not ballast motor or pilot motor cars. Between 1935 and 1950, the District line had a weed-killing train, initially consisting of a 1905-built B stock driving motor <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> control trailer. The two cars were kept at Ealing Common depot, but the control trailer was scrapped in 1937 and replaced by a second motor car, to provide more power. Weed-killing duties were not carried out during the Second World War, and the vehicles were not refurbished subsequently. They were scrapped in 1950.|$|E
5|$|Michael Schumacher {{maintained}} his start line advantage and withstood Häkkinen's attempts to pass him {{going into the}} first corner.

When the safety car pulled into the pit lane on lap eleven, Michael Schumacher began to immediately pull clear from Häkkinen and kept the lead until his pit stop on the 39th lap. When Häkkinen made his own pit stop three laps later, Michael Schumacher regained the lead which he held to clinch his sixth victory of the 2000 season; Häkkinen finished almost four seconds behind.|$|E

5|$|Shaftesbury and {{his third}} wife had {{separated}} in April 2004 and divorce proceedings had been set in motion. By that time, {{he had given her}} a windmill in the Gers region of southwestern France, the €700,000 duplex in a villa in Cannes, which included staff, a 4x4 <b>car,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> monthly allowance, ranging between €7,500 and €10,000. Shaftesbury wanted to end this arrangement and the marriage, so that he could marry his new girlfriend. While Shaftesbury was discussing his desire with his wife, a fight broke out between him and his wife's brother, Mohammed M'Barek. Lord Shaftesbury died during the fight, when Mohammed strangled him, breaking his neck.|$|E
5|$|Shortly afterward, {{another woman}} is found murdered at Coney Island {{in a similar}} manner; Stuckey finds a soda can with a bloody {{fingerprint}} on it, later confirmed to be Harrison's. The police learn Harrison disclosed his hiding place to a friend on a conspiracy theorist website; Munch recognizes the friend as his ex-wife Gwen (Carol Kane), whom he convinces to reveal Harrison's location. After Harrison evades capture, Stabler and Benson ask for help from Zimmer, who said she has been taking care of Harrison since he lost his parents as a child. An unstable Harrison visits Zimmer, who calls Stabler and Benson to arrest him. As {{they are about to}} return to the precinct, Zimmer gets locked into her <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> poisonous gas is released into the air; Stabler breaks her car window, but is unable to save her in time.|$|E
5|$|The Dowager Empress died on 13 October 1928 at Hvidøre. Her {{estate was}} sold and Olga {{purchased}} Knudsminde, {{a farm in}} Ballerup about 15miles (24km) from Copenhagen, with her portion of the proceeds. They kept horses, in which Colonel Kulikovsky was especially interested, along with Jersey cows, pigs, chickens, geese, dogs and cats. For transport they had a small <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> sledge. Tihon and Guri (age thirteen and eleven, respectively when they moved to Knudsminde) {{grew up on the}} farm. Olga ran the household {{with the help of her}} elderly, faithful lady's maid Emilia Tenso ("Mimka"), who had come along with her from Russia. The Grand Duchess lived with simplicity working in the fields, doing household chores and painting.|$|E

5|$|The film's {{special effects}} were created using stage machinery, {{miniature}} models, pyrotechnics, and the editing technique {{known as the}} substitution splice. Long shots showing the car were filmed with a miniature <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> landscape rolling past it, creating a multiplane effect. Most scenes, including the detailed and faithful recreation of the Place de l'Opéra outside the Opera House, were painted studio sets, as was Méliès's custom. However, the last scene, showing the arrival at Monte Carlo, was filmed not in the studio but outdoors in Méliès's garden.|$|E
5|$|The line {{opened on}} 12 July 1904 {{and at the}} opening there were {{delivered}} two six-axle steam locomotives from Hartmann, which were named Lier and Hole. The railway also took delivery of two passenger cars, a combined freight and conductor <b>car,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> number of freight cars. Periodically the railway needed extra haulage power, and therefore sometimes leased locomotives from the Norwegian State Railways. The initial fares were NOK1.30 from Lier to Svangstrand, while the ferry across the lake cost an additional NOK1.50. The greatest ridership was during the summer, when tourists took the line to reach the steam ships. During winter, the ridership fell, and the railway terminated at Sylling instead of Svangerstrand.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{perquisites}} of the Times appointment were {{a company}} <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> large and splendid {{office at the}} paper's building in Printing House Square, London. Levin accepted neither; he could not drive and he hated to be isolated. He commandeered a desk in the anteroom to the editor's office, a location that kept him closely {{in touch with the}} daily affairs of the paper. It also gave him ready access to the editor, William Rees Mogg, with whom he developed a good friendship. Levin's brief was to write two columns a week (later three) on any subject that he wished. His range was prodigious; he published nine volumes of his selected journalism of which the first, Taking Sides, covered subjects as diverse as the death watch beetle, Field Marshal Montgomery, Wagner, homophobia, censorship, Eldridge Cleaver, arachniphobia, theatrical nudity, and the North Thames Gas Board.|$|E

5|$|Syracuse University Ambulance, {{commonly}} referred to as SUA, is a SU Health Services-based student organization that responds to over 1,500 medical emergencies each year. Providing intermediate life support (ILS), rapid cardiac defibrillation, emergency and nonemergency transportation, and special event standby services, SUA operates two full-time transporting ambulances, a supervisor's fly <b>car,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> MCI trailer for mass-casualty incidents. Additionally, SUA operates four transport vans for non-emergency transports. Advanced life support (ALS) mutual aid is provided by the City of Syracuse's private EMS provider, Rural/Metro Medical Services. SUA was formed in 1973 by a group of students out of a need for emergency medical services on campus. Starting with only a few members and meager equipment, the Syracuse University Medical Crisis Unit was formed. The organization has evolved greatly over time but, with 70+ volunteer students, remains a student-run organization to this day. SUA provides emergency and non-emergency services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week during the academic school year and is funded by a portion of the student health fee.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to the hospital on 12 July for a tetanus injection, Behan was arrested by five policemen and taken to their Arcidosso barracks for questioning. He {{did not know what}} was happening at first as the police had no interpreter in the barracks. He was only provided with a lawyer and interpreter 15 hours later when a magistrate from Grosseto came. Behan exercised his right not to answer questions. He was released, but was formally informed that he was under suspicion. As of 15 July 2008 he was the only suspect in the case. The police subsequently seized his <b>car</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> knife from his home, and secured a room in the house in which traces of blood were allegedly found. In addition, shoe prints found were said to have matched his footwear. Custody of his car and home (except for the cellar) were returned to him on 14 July by the judge overseeing the investigation.|$|E
