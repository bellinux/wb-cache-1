All ponds supported juvenile <b>coho</b> <b>salmon.</b> Seasonal samples of stable isotopes revealed that juvenile <b>coho</b> <b>salmon,</b> threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus), caddisfly larvae, leeches, and chironomid midge larvae were enriched with marine N and C.

Habitat utilization was monitored in Mill Creek, Polk Co., Oregon by manipulating the composition of fish within three study sections to include either allopatric or sympatric populations of hatchery <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> and wild cutthroat trout. In allopatry, <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> and cutthroat trout selected feeding microhabitat that was similar in physical characteristics and exhibited extensive dietary overlap. When the two species occurred in sympatry, feeding microhabitat used by <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> was altered, however, that of cutthroat trout was comparable to allopatric cutthroat trout. No discernable differences in dietary composition between allopatric and sympatric fish were detected. While allopatric cutthroat trout always gained mass. ailopatric <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> always lost mass. Stomach fullness indices were higher for allopatric cutthroat trout than allopatric <b>coho</b> <b>salmon.</b> Sympatric cutthroat trout had comparable or greater gains of mass, indices of stomach fullness, and hepatic glycogen reserves relative to allopatric cutthroat trout.

Anadr. Fish Comm. Bull. 5 : 255 – 264. Abstract: Wild and hatchery-reared <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> (Oncorhynchus kisutch) have now co-existed in the Strait of Georgia for over 30 years, and have exhibited considerable variation in marine survival rates. This study {{is the first to}} compare diets of juvenile hatchery and wild <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> during the critical early marine period of this species. From 1997 – 2007, over 10, 000 stomachs from juvenile <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> captured in the Strait of Georgia were examined. Diets in July were dominated by decapods (primarily crab megalops) and fish (primarily herring). In September, euphausiids and amphipods (primarily hyperiids) dominated. The variability between hatchery and wild <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> diet was larger in September than in July. Prey volume, stomach fullness and fork length were significantly correlated between hatchery and wild <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> in the July and September surveys. While <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> captured in September surveys had significantly higher percentages of empty stomachs than those from July, {{there were no significant differences}} in the percentage of empty stomachs between hatchery and wild <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> in either survey. Shifts in diet composition occurred both annually and seasonally, but the trends for both groups of <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> were the same. Thus, we conclude there were no significant differences observed between hatchery and wild <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> in either appetite (volume of prey in the stomach) or in diet (composition of stomach contents) in either July or September surveys from 1997 – 2007 in the Strait of Georgia, British Columbia, Canada...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Juvenile {{salmonids}} display {{highly variable}} {{spatial and temporal}} movement patterns that are influenced by density dependent (e. g., competition, predation) and density independent (e. g., genetics, stream discharge, physical habitat conditions) factors. The effects of these factors differ with fish life history stage, but will ultimately affect how salmonids utilize freshwater nursery habitats and influence their size at smolting. Although juvenile <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> (Oncorhynchus kisutch) (Walbaum 1792) movement patterns and their relationships with body mass have been previously examined, the temporal scale considered in most studies has been within individual seasonal periods. In this study, we monitored the movement of PIT tagged juvenile <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> throughout the period of freshwater residence in an entire southern Oregon coastal basin to identify the prevalent sedentary and mobile strategies these fish may adopt and to examine possible relationships between those strategies and fish body mass, growth and survival. Specific objectives include: 1) to describe juvenile <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> movement strategies and patterns during the freshwater residence period; 2) to determine the relative proportions of juvenile <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> that exhibit each movement strategy; 3) to establish whether juvenile <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> body mass and growth rates are related {{with a set of}} habitat variables recorded during this study; 4) to determine whether <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> body mass or growth rates are related to movement strategy; and 5) to evaluate whether winter survival of juvenile <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> is associated with movement strategy. Results revealed seasonally and spatially variable movement. More than half of <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> tracked throughout the period of freshwater residence exhibited movement behavior that differed between summer and winter seasons. Within seasonal periods, <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> in tidally affected reaches exhibited greater prevalence of mobile behavior relative to those in riverine reaches. Regression analysis indicated coho biomass density, habitat unit structural complexity and size at tagging were important in predicting summer growth of <b>coho</b> <b>salmon.</b> Juvenile <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> that were mobile during summer were either larger or no different in body mass in early summer relative to fish that exhibited sedentary behavior. Similarly, no consistent differences were observed between sedentary and mobile <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> in regards to summer growth. <b>Coho</b> <b>salmon</b> that were sedentary in summer and winter experienced higher apparent winter survival than mobile fish in each season, though the reach in which an individual resided at the start of winter appeared to also affect survival. <b>Coho</b> <b>salmon</b> residing in the tide gate reservoir reach and mainstem headwater reaches experienced greatest apparent winter survival. These results indicate that juvenile <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> movement within a stream basin is spatially and temporally variable and that mobility does not necessarily indicate inferior competitive ability. In a broader context, variable movement patterns reflect the capacity for plastic behavior in salmonids and this research demonstrates the importance of maintaining seasonally diverse freshwater and estuarine nursery habitats for juvenile fish...|$|R

Following the flood, fidelity and out-migrant trap capture were greater for juvenile <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> occupying alcoves (50 % and 17. 0 %) than for those occupying backwaters (16 % and 6. 1 %) or main-channel pools (7 % and 2. 7 %). The out-migrant trap capture of juvenile <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> that had been PIT-tagged before the flood (16. 1 %; N 5 209) was similar to that of fish PIT-tagged after the flood (15. 3 %; N 5 829).

40|$|Abstract. -The southernmost {{populations of}} <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> Oncorhynchus kisutch occur in Cal-ifornia where native coho stocks have {{declined}} or disappeared from all streams {{in which they}} were historically recorded. <b>Coho</b> <b>salmon</b> previously occurred in as many as 582 streams, from the Smith River near the Oregon border to the San Lorenzo River on the central coast. Information on the recent presence or absence of <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> was available for only 248 (43 %) of those streams. Of these 248 streams, 54 % still contained <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> and 46 % did not. The farther south a stream is located, {{the more likely it is}} to have lost its <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> population. We estimate that the total number of adult <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> entering California streams in 1987 -l 991 averaged around 31, 000 fish per year, with hatchery populations making up 57 % of this total. Thus, about 13, 000 non-hatchery <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> have been spawning in California streams each year since 1987, an estimate that includes naturalized stocks containing about 9, 000 fish of recent hatchery ancestry.

40|$|Abstract. —The {{abundance}} of <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> Oncorhyn-chus kisutch has declined dramatically {{over much of}} the southern part of its range along the Pacific Coast of North America. This decline has created the need to reduce fishing mortalities, including bycatch mortalities in fisheries that are targeting other species. Traditional gill-net fishing causes an estimated 35 – 70 % mortality rate on incidentally caught <b>coho</b> <b>salmon.</b> A reduction in this high mortality rate is necessary if gill nets continue to be used in fisheries that inadvertently intercept de-pressed <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> stocks while fishing other species. By using modified gear, short net soak times, careful handling of fish on removal from the gill net, and a newly designed recovery box, the short-term mortality rate on incidentally caught <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> can be reduced to as little as 6 %, possibly even lower in some circumstances. This substantial reduction in mortality on nontargeted species expands the possible role of gill nets in the de-velopment of selective fisheries.

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to develop {{techniques}} to provide the information needed to determine if Lower Columbia River <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> represent a 'species' under the Endangered Species Act. Our report features two new nuclear DNA approaches to the improved detection of genetic variation: (1) Studies of DNA-level genetic variation for two nuclear growth hormone genes; (2) Use of arbitrary DNA primers (randomly amplified polymorphic DNA, or 'RAPD' primers) to detect variation at large numbers of nuclear genes. We used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify variable sections (introns) of two growth hormone genes (GH-I and G/f-Z) in several salmonid species. <b>Coho</b> <b>salmon</b> had three DNA length variants for G/-I intron C. Restriction analysis and sequencing provided valuable information about the mode of evolution of these DNA sequences. We tested segregation of the variants in captive broods of <b>coho</b> <b>salmon,</b> and demonstrated that they are alleles at a single Mendelian locus. Population studies using the GH- 1 alleles showed highly significant frequency differences between Lower Columbia River and Oregon Coast <b>coho</b> <b>salmon,</b> and marginal differences among stocks within these regions. These new markers are adequately defined and tested to use in <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> population studies of any size. The nature of the variation at GH- 1 (Variable Number Tandem Repeats, or 'VNTRs') suggests that more genetic variants will be found in <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> from other areas. GH- 2 intron C also showed length variation in <b>coho</b> <b>salmon,</b> and this variation {{was found to be}} sex-linked.

40|$|This {{report is}} {{a summary of}} the results of 883 purse seine sets made for {{juvenile}} salmonids during 15 cruises off the coasts of Oregon and Washington during the springs and summers of 1981 - 1985. Juvenile <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> (Oncorhynchus kisutch) occurred most frequently, followed by chinook salmon (0. tshawytscha). The juveniles of these two species co-occurred more frequently than expected. Juvenile chum, pink and sockeye salmon (0. keta, O. gorbuscha, and O. nerka), steelhead (0. mykiss) and cutthroat trout (0. clarki clarki) were caught much less frequently and in lower numbers than <b>coho</b> or chinook <b>salmon.</b> We found no evidence of large schools ofjuvenile salmonids. A northerly movement of juvenile <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> wa suggested by decreased catches off Oregon and increased catches off Washington between early and late summer. Highest catch per set of juvenile <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> was usually found inshore of 37. 2 km. Juvenile chinook salmon were usually found within 27. 9 km of the coast. Juvenile salmonids were found over a broad range of surface salinities and temperatures. High catches of juvenile <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> occurred in both the low salinity waters of the Columbia River plume and in adjacent higher salinity waters. Preferences for specific salinities or temperatures were not obvious for any species, although catch rates of juvenile <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> were highest in years when chlorophyll content was also high. Based on expansions of fish with coded wire tags, we estimated that hatchery <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> smolts comprised 74...|$|R

50|$|A 1959 survey {{from the}} U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service {{reported}} Mattole spawning runs were 10,000 Chinook <b>salmon</b> and 4,000 <b>coho</b> <b>salmon.</b> Later in 1964, a survey from the California Department of Fish and Game reported Mattole spawning runs were 10,000 Chinook <b>salmon</b> and 4,000 <b>coho</b> <b>salmon.</b> During the 1980s, reports showed the Chinook salmon run fell to 3,000. This number dropped even lower in 1990 and 1991, when Chinook salmon run fell to 100 and <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> fell to approximately 100 as well. The American Fisheries Society classified the species as “high risk for extinction”.|$|R
50|$|The total North Pacific {{harvest of}} <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> in 2010 {{exceeded}} 6.3 million fish, of which 4.5 million {{were taken in}} the United States and 1.7 million in Russia. This corresponds to some 21,000 tonnes in all. <b>Coho</b> <b>salmon</b> are {{the backbone of the}} Alaskan troll fishery; however, the majority are caught by the net fishery (gillnet and seine). <b>Coho</b> <b>salmon</b> average 3.5% by fish and 5.9% by weight of the annual Alaska salmon harvest. The total North Pacific yields of the pink salmon, chum salmon and sockeye salmon are some 10-20 fold larger by weight.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{lines of}} {{evidence}} support the historical presence of <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in San Francisquito Creek. Archaeological remains of unspecified salmonids ("possibly coho") {{were reported by}} Gobalet in the creek. Leidy concluded that <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> were likely present and cited that the most suitable habitat for <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> was in perennial, well shaded reaches of mainstem San Francisquito Creek, and several small, perennial tributaries including Los Trancos, Corte Madera, Bear, and West Union creeks. In addition, three independent oral history sources indicate that <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> were abundant in the creek through {{the first half of}} the twentieth century. According to local historian Dorothy Regnery's notes from her 1966 interview with Edgar H. Batchelder, who was 2 years old when his father became caretaker of Searsville dam in 1897, [...] "When the dam was [...] "wasting", or overflowing in the winter, salmon would swim upstream as far as the base of the dam. Using a pitchfork Mr. Batchelder could spear them to supplement the family's menu." [...] His [...] "favorite place to fish for trout was in the Dennis Martin Creek". A second source described catching [...] "steelhead" [...] and silver (<b>coho)</b> <b>salmon</b> in San Francisquito Creek and the Guadalupe River System in the 1930s and 1940s. He said that the Guadalupe River also had runs of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) that were very large in wet years." [...] Thirdly, Dennis L. Bark, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, recalls playing on San Francisquito Creek around 1947: [...] "Salmon swam up it, and in winter it was a dangerous place." [...] The historical range of <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> overlapped geographically with San Francisquito Creek. It is definitely established that <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> were historically present in other San Francisco Bay streams such as San Mateo Creek and Alameda Creek. Also, the southern limit of <b>coho</b> <b>salmon</b> in coastal California streams was recently confirmed to extend through Santa Cruz County based on both archaeological evidence and historically collected specimens.|$|R
