5|$|Born in 1350 or 1351, Ivan Shishman was {{the eldest}} son of emperor Ivan Alexander (r. 1331–1371) and his second wife Sarah–Theodora, a Jew {{converted}} to the Eastern Orthodox Church. His birth brought {{up the issue of}} the succession to the Bulgarian throne. Ivan Shishman had two elder brothers by the Ivan Alexander's first wife, Theodora of Wallachia. The eldest one, Michael Asen, was proclaimed successor to the throne and co-emperor shortly after Ivan Alexander's accession to the throne. However, Michael Asen's early death in battle against the Ottomans in 1355 put forward the question of succession once more. It is likely that Sarah–Theodora pressured Ivan Alexander to select her own son as his successor, although Ivan Sratsimir would have <b>come</b> <b>next</b> under the majorat system. The issue was decided in Ivan Shishman's favour because the latter was born in the purple (after his father was crowned), thus making him eligible as successor. By the end of 1355, Ivan Shishman had been proclaimed heir to the throne and co-emperor.|$|E
5|$|In the 1340s Ivan Sratsimir rose in {{prominence}} {{because he}} was married and already had children, while his eldest brother Michael Asen and his wife did not produce children for ten years. In 1352 Ivan Alexander introduced the title junior emperor {{in order to secure}} the smooth and secure transition of the throne and Ivan Sratsimir became known by that title. In the end of 1347 or in the beginning of 1348, however, Ivan Alexander divorced with his first wife and sent her to a monastery so he could marry the Jew Sarah-Theodora. That event spoiled the relations between Ivan Sratsimir and his father and the conflict deepened after the birth of Ivan Shishman to Ivan Alexander and Sarah-Theodora in 1350/1351. The conflict climaxed in 1355–1356 when the undisputed heir to the throne, Michael Asen IV, perished in battle against the Ottomans. According to the Majorat system, Ivan Sratsimir should have <b>come</b> <b>next</b> in the succession line but since Ivan Shishman was born in the purple, i.e. after his father was crowned, Ivan Alexander and Sarah-Theodora declared Ivan Shishman successor to the throne. A hint of the feud between father and son {{is the fact that the}} image of Ivan Sratsimir was not included in the Tetraevangelia of Ivan Alexander where the whole imperial family was pictured, including Ivan Alexander's son-in-law. That could mean either that Ivan Sratsimir was disinherited and proclaimed himself emperor in Vidin or that he was denied the title junior emperor and given the rule of Vidin as a compensation.|$|E

25|$|Prost {{took the}} 1989 world title after a {{collision}} with Senna at the Suzuka Circuit in Japan, the penultimate race of the season, which Senna needed to win to remain in contention for the title. Prost had managed to leave the grid faster than Senna by removing the gurney flap from his car, which was unbeknownst to Senna. This reduction in aerodynamic downforce made Prost's car faster on the straights, but slower through corners- a clever choice to make it even harder for Senna to pass on a circuit already difficult on which to pass. On lap 46, Senna had finally <b>come</b> <b>next</b> to Prost and attempted a pass on the inside at the last chicane. Prost turned right into the upcoming corner, cutting Senna off and tangling wheels with him. The collision caused both McLarens to slide to a standstill into the escape road ahead. Prost abandoned the race at that point, whereas Senna urged marshals for a push-start, which he received, then proceeding with the race after a pit stop to replace the damaged nose on his car. He took the lead from the Benetton of Alessandro Nannini {{and went on to}} claim victory, only to be disqualified following a stewards meeting after the race. Senna was disqualified for receiving a push start, cutting the chicane after the collision with Prost, and for crossing into the pit lane entry which {{was not part of the}} track. A large fine and temporary suspension of his FIA Super License followed in the winter of 1989, and an irate Senna engaged in a bitter war of words with the FIA and its then-president, Jean-Marie Balestre, whom he blamed for his disqualification in Japan. Senna claimed that Balestre had forced the race stewards to disqualify him so his fellow Frenchman Prost could win the championship, though the stewards of the meeting denied that Balestre forced their decision, claiming that he was not present when the decision was made. Senna finished the season second with six wins and one second place. Prost left McLaren for rivals Ferrari for the following year.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, IGN's Ramsey Isler {{viewed the}} episode more positively, and rated it 7.9/10. He {{explained}} it [...] "deserves praise for {{doing a lot}} of things well," [...] and lauded the actors' performances, the props, the direction, and cinematography. Despite however finding Walter less entertaining than the previous season, and believing {{the first half of the}} episode moved too slowly and resembled [...] "an ordinary procedural crime show," [...] Isler enjoyed the ending for [...] " [...] it all together and [...] the previous 90% worthwhile". After watching the episode, MTV columnist Josh Wigler [...] "declared [...] fondness" [...] for Joshua Jackson, stating the actor had [...] "won [...] over thanks to Peter's central role in these first few episodes of Fringes" [...] second season". Wigler continued that it was [...] "an excellent mystery-of-the-week episode to be sure, though I'm really itching for more details on the alternate reality.

500|$|Alvin Lu found The Warped Ones to be a {{prime example}} of the Sun Tribe genre and placed it among those films whose outlook made way for the Japanese pink film. In the film Tim Lucas noted antecedents and a {{possible}} influence to [...] "the most hellbent characters" [...] in the films of acclaimed director Quentin Tarantino's films and specifically to Stanley Kubrick's iconic A Clockwork Orange (1971). Lucas drew comparisons between The Warped Ones main character Akira and A Clockwork Oranges Alex DeLarge, including their respective obsessions with hard jazz and the music of Ludwig van Beethoven, the former with a framed copy of Ornette Coleman's album The Shape of Jazz to <b>Come</b> <b>next</b> to his bed, the latter an engraving of Beethoven. Also, scenes of the former's verbal deconstructions by a group of art students versus the latter's by the government. Akira's attacks on abstract art and DeLarge's on pop art–lined homes. Finally, the character's regular hangouts, both painted with black walls, the former's adorned with portraits of jazz legends, the latter's with advertisements for [...] "Vellocet" [...] and [...] "Drencrom"—the fictional drugs DeLarge and his gang use to invigorate themselves before their criminal acts.

500|$|The film {{begins with}} a short text {{introduction}} stating {{the purpose of the}} footage and its intent: [...] "For the fans..." [...] After short dialogues from various dancers, Ortega is heard talking through the original concert opening sequence involving a body suit made from screens which display fast clips and images with bright intensity from which Jackson emerges on stage. Immediately after this, Jackson begins [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'" [...] first solo, which pauses half-way through and a small snippet of Jackson singing [...] "Speechless" [...] a cappella is shown. Jackson is then joined by dancers and completes the first number. A short clip showing rehearsals of the [...] "toaster" [...] mechanism is shown before rehearsal footage of [...] "Jam" [...] is played. This plays directly into the green screen adaptation of soldiers dancers for [...] "Bad" [...] which are also used for [...] "They Don't Care About Us" [...] which is shown next. From here, the film shows Michael directing Ortega and his band for his solo rehearsal performance of [...] "Human Nature" [...] which he performs a cappella, then acoustic and finally with full band. Green screen rehearsals for the video vignette for [...] "Smooth Criminal" [...] <b>come</b> <b>next</b> (with scenes from his film Moonwalker as well as the film Gilda featuring Rita Hayworth as the title character singing [...] "Put the Blame on Mame"), with dress rehearsals of the song following, including parts of the vignette intertwined with the dancing. Jackson is seen next directing his musical team for the cues in his song [...] "The Way You Make Me Feel". Jackson then performs a rehearsal with dancers which he alters and changes as he goes. Jackson then rehearses a medley of The Jackson 5 songs: [...] "I Want You Back", [...] "The Love You Save", [...] "I'll Be There" [...] and [...] "Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)". After this, Jackson sings with Judith Hill, one of his backup singers, on his duet song [...] "I Just Can't Stop Loving You" [...] in which he sings at full strength, directing his partner as he goes. The filming for the [...] "Thriller" [...] vignette is then shown with Jackson and Ortega watching with 3D glasses. Jackson is then seen rehearsing [...] "Thriller" [...] with the vignette intertwined like that in [...] "Smooth Criminal." [...] Footage of the show's aerialists rehearsing to the instrumental of [...] "Who Is It" [...] is shown next.|$|E

[...] He was much concerned with the modernisation and [...] "Indianisation" [...] of the army in India. The main building and its central hall at the Indian Military Academy is named after him.

Three days of heavy rain and snow followed his arrival, providing water for the Bábís and decimating the army's earth fortifications. `Abdu'lláh Khán and his officers took up residence in a nearby village to avoid the weather, and were absent when, {{on the fourth day}} of the siege, Quddús ordered the Bábís to disperse his army. The outnumbered Bábí's took the army by surprise and pushed them back to the village where `Abdu'lláh Khán was living, where they engaged and killed `Abdu'lláh Khán and every officer of his army. At this point Quddús ordered a retreat. Four hundred of the Shah's soldiers were killed, and around 100 of their horses captured by the Bábís. Upon returning to the fort, Quddús warned the Bábís that a larger, better organized army would <b>come</b> <b>next,</b> and ordered them to expand the fort. [...] After this point, the fort walls reached ten meters tall, with a deep ditch surrounding it, a well for water, and tunnels and storehouses dug underground for refuge and storage.|$|E
