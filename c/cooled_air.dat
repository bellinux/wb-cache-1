25|$|Unlike {{the subway}} cars {{of most other}} systems, Montreal's cars do not have air {{conditioning}}. In summer, the lack of <b>cooled</b> <b>air</b> can make trips uncomfortable for passengers. The claim, stated by the STM, is that the Metro being built entirely underground, air conditioning would heat the tunnels potentially creating a larger problem (the subway system in Sapporo also suffers from that same issue).|$|E
25|$|<b>Cooling</b> <b>air</b> is airflow that is {{injected}} through small {{holes in the}} liner to generate a layer (film) of <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> to protect the liner from the combustion temperatures. The implementation of <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> has to be carefully designed so it does not directly interact with the combustion air and process. In some cases, as much as 50% of the inlet air is used as <b>cooling</b> <b>air.</b> There are several different methods of injecting this <b>cooling</b> <b>air,</b> and the method can influence the temperature profile that the liner is exposed to (see Liner, above).|$|R
40|$|It {{is common}} {{practice}} to use Pre-Swirl Nozzles to facilitate getting the turbine blade <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> onboard the rotating disk with minimum pressure loss and reduced temperature. Higher engine OPR's and expanded aircraft operating envelopes have pushed <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> temperatures {{to the limits}} of current disk materials and are stressing the capability to cool the blade with practical levels of <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> flow. Providing 'Cooled' <b>Cooling</b> <b>Air</b> is one approach being considered to overcome these limitations. This presentation looks at how the introduction of 'Cooled' <b>Cooling</b> <b>Air</b> impacts the design of the Pre-Swirl Nozzles, specifically in relation to the radial location of the nozzles...|$|R
50|$|As air is heated, it expands and {{possesses}} less density (weight {{per unit}} volume) than <b>cooler</b> <b>air.</b> Therefore, the heated air rises and displaces the <b>cooler</b> <b>air</b> (the <b>cooler</b> <b>air</b> descends). The method of Dry-heat gravity convection produces inconsistent temperatures within the chamber {{and has a}} very slow turn over.|$|R
25|$|An energy tower (also {{known as}} a {{downdraft}} energy tower, because the air flows down the tower) is a tall (1,000 meters) and wide (400 meters) hollow cylinder with a water spray system at the top. Pumps lift the water {{to the top of}} the tower and then spray the water inside the tower. Evaporation of water cools the hot, dry air hovering at the top. The <b>cooled</b> <b>air,</b> now denser than the outside warmer air, falls through the cylinder, spinning a turbine at the bottom. The turbine drives a generator which produces the electricity.|$|E
25|$|One way {{in which}} caves retain low {{temperatures}} is through a constant input of cold air from outside the cave circulating in. Typically, the caves supporting the largest Indiana bat populations have multiple entrances that allow cool air from outside the cave to come in, creating a circulation of fresh <b>cooled</b> <b>air.</b> Gates that are meant to keep vandals out of caves have altered the temperature and airflow of hibernacula, resulting in population declines of Indiana bats at many major hibernacula throughout their range. Removing or modifying gates {{at some of these}} have given these populations a chance to rebound. Also, the bats seem to prefer a relative humidity of 74% to 100%, although it is uncommon for the air to be saturated. Relative humidities of only 50.4% have also been recorded.|$|E

In humid environments, the evaporator will freeze up from the accumulating condensation if the compressor operates constantly, which will ultimately block airflow.

Freeze up is not a concern in dry environments such as deserts, and this setting provides constantly <b>cooled</b> <b>air</b> flow into the passenger compartment.|$|E

40|$|High {{pressure}} {{turbine nozzle}} guide vane of a gas turbine engine, which operates at gas temperatures in excess of 1700 K, employs various cooling techniques to keep the vane within safe operating limits. Even though {{nozzle guide vane}}s are designed using heat transfer co-relations available in published papers and fundamental data, it is required to test the nozzle guide vane to ascertain the surface metal temperature and verify the adequacy of cooling. Adequacy of cooling is quantified by the term cooling effectiveness expressed and as percentage. Cooling effectiveness {{is a function of}} gas temperature, <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> temperature and surface metal temperature. The objective of the current work was to study the effect of <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> temperature on <b>cooling</b> effectiveness. Tests were conducted on a high pressure turbine nozzle guide vane. Gas pressure, gas temperature, <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> pressure was kept constant and the <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> temperature was varied as a ratio of gas temperature to <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> temperature and its effect on metal temperature studied. It was seen that, over the range of <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> temperature tested, <b>cooling</b> effectiveness remained sensibly constant. Such tests also assist in estimating the surface metal temperature of the nozzle guide vane in the engine...|$|R
25|$|The liner {{contains}} the combustion process and introduces the various airflows (intermediate, dilution, and <b>cooling,</b> see <b>Air</b> flow paths below) into the combustion zone. The liner must be {{designed and built}} to withstand extended high temperature cycles. For that reason liners tend to be made from superalloys like Hastelloy X. Furthermore, even though high performance alloys are used, the liners must be <b>cooled</b> with <b>air</b> flow. Some combustors also make use of thermal barrier coatings. However, <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> is still required. In general, {{there are two main}} types of liner cooling; film cooling and transpiration cooling. Film cooling works by injecting (by one of several methods) <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> from outside of the liner to just inside of the liner. This creates a thin film of <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> that protects the liner, reducing the temperature at the liner from around 1800 kelvins (K) to around 830 K, for example. The other type of liner cooling, transpiration cooling, is a more modern approach that uses a porous material for the liner. The porous liner allows a small amount of <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> to pass through it, providing cooling benefits similar to film cooling. The two primary differences are in the resulting temperature profile of the liner and the amount of <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> required. Transpiration <b>cooling</b> results in a much more even temperature profile, as the <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> is uniformly introduced through pores. Film <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> is generally introduced through slats or louvers, resulting in an uneven profile where it is cooler at the slat and warmer between the slats. More importantly, transpiration cooling uses much less <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> (on the order of 10% of total airflow, rather than 20-50% for film <b>cooling).</b> Using less <b>air</b> for <b>cooling</b> allows more to be used for combustion, which is more and more important for high performance, high thrust engines.|$|R
60|$|But our broad simple {{statement}} about the upper current from the equator, and the under current from the pole, requires a slight modification, which we thought it best not to mingle with the statement itself. The heated air from the equator does indeed commence to flow in an upper current, and the <b>cooled</b> <b>air</b> from the pole in an under current; but, as the upper currents of air are speedily cooled by exposure to space, and the under currents are heated by contact with the earth's surface, they constantly change places--the lower current becoming the upper, and vice versa. But they do not change direction. The Equatorial Current ascends, rushes north to a point about latitude 30 degrees, where, being sufficiently cooled, it swoops down, and continues its Northward rush along the earth. At another point the Polar Current quits the earth, and soaring up, in consequence of its recently acquired heat, becomes the upper current. This change in the two currents takes place twice in their course.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIndirect {{evaporative}} cooling system to produce {{cold water and}} indirect {{evaporative cooling}} system to produce <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> are compared in this paper. From the process transformation, to remove the same quantity of indoor heat, the indirect evaporative <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> system produces much more cooling energy {{in which more than}} a half is wasted to <b>cool</b> fresh <b>air</b> and also more heat transfer area are used. Also the transportation electricity consumption is much higher when using <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> than using cold water. Two real applications are given, from the field testing data, the system COP of the indirect evaporative cooling system to produce cold water was 4. 6 ∼ 5. 9, which is 1 ∼ 2 higher than the system COP of the system to produce <b>cooling</b> <b>air.</b> Thus, using the indirect evaporative chillers to produce cold water to remove indoor sensible heat is better than using the indirect evaporative air coolers to produce <b>cooling</b> <b>air...</b>|$|R
50|$|Cooling {{the leading}} edge of the blade can be difficult, because the {{pressure}} of the <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> just inside the cooling hole may not be much different from that of the oncoming gas stream. One solution is to incorporate a cover plate on the disc. This acts as a centrifugal compressor to pressurize the <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> before it enters the blade. Another solution is to use an ultra-efficient turbine rim seal to pressurize the area where the <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> passes across to the rotating disc.|$|R
40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} for cold gas reinjection in through-flow and reverse-flow wave rotors having {{a plurality of}} channels formed around a periphery thereof. A first port injects a supply of <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> into the channels. A second port allows the supply of <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> to exit the channels and flow to a combustor. A third port injects a supply of hot gas from the combustor into the channels. A fourth port allows the supply of hot gas to exit the channels and flow to a turbine. A diverting port and a reinjection port {{are connected to the}} second and third ports, respectively. The diverting port diverts a portion of the <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> exiting through the second port as reinjection air. The diverting port is fluidly connected to the reinjection port which reinjects the reinjection air back into the channels. The reinjection air evacuates the channels of the hot gas resident therein and cools the channel walls, a pair of end walls of the rotor, ducts communicating with the rotor and subsequent downstream components. In a second embodiment, the second port receives all of the <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> exiting the channels and the diverting port diverts a portion of the <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> just prior to the <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> flowing to the combustor...|$|R

5000|$|At this point, the {{temperature}} of the compressed <b>cooled</b> <b>air</b> is somewhat greater than the ambient temperature of the outside air.

[...] The work extracted by the expansion turbine is transmitted by a shaft to spin the pack's centrifugal compressor and an inlet fan which draws in the external air for the heat exchangers during ground running; ram air is used in flight.

40|$|To reduce {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) {{emissions}} of road going vehicles, the aerodynamic drag {{is an important}} area to focus on. Reducing aerodynamic drag will lead to reduced fuel consumption and hence decreased CO 2 emissions. A significant element of the aerodynamic drag of a modern passenger car is the cooling drag, which can constitute up to 15 %. Possible solutions to reduce the cooling drag include closing off parts of the <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> inlets when {{only a small amount}} of <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> flow is needed. The focus of this study is on the aerodynamic effects closing off the <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> inlets have on a modern passenger car.

Results show that reduction in aerodynamic drag is possible by closing off the lower <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> inlet and furthermore that this has a noticeable effect on the base pressure.

50|$|An {{evaporative}} cooler (also swamp cooler, desert <b>cooler</b> and wet <b>air</b> <b>cooler)</b> is {{a device that}} <b>cools</b> <b>air</b> through the evaporation of water. Evaporative cooling differs from typical air conditioning systems, which use vapor-compression or absorption refrigeration cycles. Evaporative cooling works by exploiting water's large enthalpy of vaporization. The temperature of dry air can be dropped significantly through the phase transition of liquid water to water vapor (evaporation). This can <b>cool</b> <b>air</b> using much less energy than refrigeration.
