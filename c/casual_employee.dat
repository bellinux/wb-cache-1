40|$|Are casual jobs {{inferior}} jobs? This {{issue is}} usually {{framed in the}} labour law literature by asking whether <b>casual</b> <b>employees</b> are legally precarious {{in the sense of}} enjoying fewer rights and benefits compared to those conferred upon permanent employees. The answer, according to most labour law scholars, is `yes'. The characterisation of <b>casual</b> <b>employees</b> as legally precarious is, however, problematic because of its underlying legal understandings. Foremost perhaps, many scholars erroneously ascribe a uniform contractual character to casual employment. Moreover, they wrongly presume that the contractual arrangements under which a casual worker is employed necessarily determines his or her access to protection and benefits. Further, there has been insufficient appreciation of the complex interaction between various definitions of casual employment. It is these difficulties that give rise to the principal question for this thesis: To what extent are <b>casual</b> <b>employees</b> legally precarious in the sense of enjoying fewer rights and benefits compared with those conferred upon permanent' employees?. This question can be broken down into two subsidiary questions: 1) What are the rights and benefits enjoyed by <b>casual</b> <b>employees?</b> 2) How do such rights and benefits compare with those afforded to `permanent employees? This thesis addresses these questions in three key areas of labour protection: protection against dismissal; income security and access to standard leave entitlements. In addressing the first sub-question, the thesis finds that, as the law stood. on 1 December 2005, <b>casual</b> <b>employees</b> enjoy varying levels of protection in all three areas. Much the same applies to permanent employees (as defined by this thesis). These varying grades of protection largely result {{from the fact that the}} availability of labour protection depends on a multiplicity of factors of which permanent/casual status is merely one consideration. When the rights and benefits of <b>casual</b> and permanent <b>employees</b> were compared, the conclusion was reached that <b>casual</b> <b>employees,</b> as a class, are not necessarily legally precarious in these three areas of protection. Neither can it be said that <b>casual</b> <b>employees,</b> as a class, are necessarily legally precarious in each of these areas. There is, however, a group of <b>casual</b> <b>employees</b> that are legally precarious in all three areas. It can be tentatively concluded that these legally precarious casuals form a significant proportion of workers considered by the Australian Bureau of Statistics to be <b>casual</b> <b>employees.</b> Conversely, some <b>casual</b> <b>employees</b> are not legally precarious in all three areas. Again it can be tentatively suggested that these protected casuals form a meaningful proportion of ABS <b>casual</b> <b>employees.</b> The thesis concludes by proposing a preferable approach to conceiving the question of legal precariousness. What appears to underlie the problematic answer given by labour law scholars to the question of legal precariousness is a binary model that equates permanent employment with protection, and casual employment with inferior protection or a lack of protection. A preferable approach to the legal precariousness of <b>casual</b> <b>employees</b> is to see the protection afforded to <b>casual</b> and permanent <b>employees</b> through a continuum model. This model, not only recognises the varying grades of protection enjoyed by <b>casual</b> and permanent <b>employees</b> but it also reformulates the question of legal precariousness. Instead of asking whether <b>casual</b> <b>employees</b> enjoy fewer rights and benefits compared to those conferred upon permanent employees, the question becomes: Is a worker or a particular group of workers legally precarious in the sense of not enjoying standard rights and benefits?Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|R

40|$|It {{is argued}} {{in this paper}} that {{management}} holds erroneous assumptions about casual employees' affective orientation towards the workplace. Such assumptions allow management to obviate the need for provision of certain employment systems. The research, which {{provided the basis for}} this paper, investigated the relevant work context factors associated with casualisation and the effects of casual work arrangements on employee job satisfaction and commitment. A generative methodology, using both quantitative and qualitative methods was used to gather the data. A total of 454 <b>casual</b> <b>employees</b> were surveyed: forty-two employees in a sample of 6 clubs within the top 200 registered Clubs in NSW were interviewed, twenty-eight <b>casual</b> <b>employees</b> took part in a pre-test of the questionnaire, and three hundred and eighty four returned questionnaires from a sample of sixteen clubs. Key findings of the research include the observation that <b>casual</b> <b>employees</b> experience varying levels of commitment and satisfaction according to their perceptions of work context factors in their organisation. This implies that <b>casual</b> <b>employees</b> are not homogenous in the way they perceive their work environment, and should not be assumed to be indifferent to their work environment and work opportunities. Therefore, a model of employment systems is proposed that is relevant to the highly casualised enterprise. The model is intended to create equitable work context factors which emphasise opportunities for the entire organisation rather than a 'mythical core'...|$|R

40|$|The casualisation of the Australian {{workforce}} proceeded {{at a more}} or less steady pace from 1992 to 2004. Introduction There is {{no formal}} definition of casual employment {{in the sense that it}} has a meaning set down in law or specified in awards and agreements. Instead, casual employment has generally been regarded as employment in which there is an absence of entitlement to paid annual leave or sick leave. The absence of paid leave entitlements was first adopted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) as a proxy measure of casual employment in 1988. While this approach can be justified on the grounds that most persons on a casual contract receive a pay loading in lieu of paid annual leave and sick leave, the problem is there is no necessary correlation between type of employment contract and qualifications for these entitlements. The ABS has since dropped the term ‘casual’ and now simply distinguishes between employees with paid leave entitlements and those without. While the ABS also collects information for a category of worker it describes as ‘self-identified casual’, this quick guide maintains the proxy measure that a <b>casual</b> <b>employee</b> is an employee without paid leave entitlements. It should be noted, however, that owner managers of incorporated enterprises (OMIEs) are excluded from the scope of the definition of <b>casual</b> <b>employee.</b> There is no sense in which OMIEs can reasonably be regarded as casual employees and, even though the ABS has tended to treat OMIEs as employees of their own business, it is possibly for this reason that from 2007 the ABS ceased to ask OMIEs if they gave themselves paid leave...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This paper aims {{to explore}} the human {{resource}} (HR) challenges faced by hotel managers in Langkawi due {{to the implementation of}} the minimum wage order (MWO). Design/methodology/approach This study collected qualitative data from 18 managers and two owners from 19 hotels of various sizes and levels of service, including budget and boutique resorts on Langkawi Island, Malaysia. A semi-structured interview was used to ask the question “What are the challenges faced by hotel managers due to the implementation of an MWO?” Findings: The challenges faced by the managers are: low employee productivity levels, many employees with a salary below the minimum wage rate, difficulty paying staff because of low revenue and conflicting laws and guidelines relating to the issues related to the service charge. Research limitations/implications: This study provides an initial qualitative exploration of an important current legal development bearing on hotel managers in Malaysia. It provides some initial findings from Langkawi, but the findings may not represent the attitudes of hotel managers in other parts of Malaysia. Practical implications: This study contributes to HR management literature by providing an insight into challenges faced by hotel managers in a developing country. To the managers, the MWO guideline is a serious challenge, as some of their employees are not productive enough to be paid at the minimum wage rate. To address the increasing labour cost, some have turned to the employment of foreign workers, whereas others have increased their <b>casual</b> <b>employee</b> numbers. These insights may serve to guide policy-makers and hotel managers in other developing countries that are planning to introduce an MWO. Social implications: For the MWO to be effective, it is crucial for the government to develop effective guidelines for its implementation and for hotel employees amongst the Langkawi community to increase their level of productivity. Originality/value: The Malaysian MWO policy was introduced in 2012. The policy affects employees’ remuneration and provides a challenge in implementation for the Malaysian hotel industry, especially in Langkawi. Although many studies on MWO implementation have focused on unemployment, this study provides the managers’ perspective on the challenges faced due to the implementation of this policy and identifies reasons why the unemployment rate for local workers may increase after the implementation of an MWO...|$|E

This upward bias in the data has increased since the late 1980 s and is most evident for people working full-time. „X Using alternative data from a new irregular ABS survey, it is estimated that there were 1. 5 million casual contract employees in August 1998 (equivalent to 17. 7 per cent of employed persons, compared to 23. 2 per cent who would have satisfied the ABS {{definition of}} a <b>casual</b> <b>employee).</b> „X In August 1998, 95 per cent of casual contract employees had an implicit contract for ongoing employment, only 4 per cent had a job which their employer had indicated was short term, and many perceived {{that they were able to}} progress to an ongoing contract job. „X More than a third of casual contract employees had an implicit contract for ongoing employment and regular earnings in August 1998. Many of these ¡¥ongoing casuals¡¦ have been granted entitlements associated with ongoing employment (such as long service leave) because the true nature of their work is ongoing. „X However, 80 per cent of casual contract employees in August 1998 were not protected by unfair dismissal laws, 62 per cent had irregular earnings (excluding overtime), and 40 per cent wanted to work more hours. They were also concentrated in low skill occupations „X The welfare impacts of particular job traits will depend on the preferences of those affected. Casual contract employees tend to be young, female, and full-time dependent students. A large minority (29 per cent in August 1998) are aged over 24 and have dependants, although this group is more likely to have employment conditions closer to ongoing contract employees. „X Hence, whether an employee has a casual contract provides little information about his or her welfare. Where the concern is about so- called ¡¥precarious¡¦ employment, analysts need to identify such employment on the basis of work arrangements rather than the type of employment contract. casual contract employment - casual employees - forms of employment survey - job traits - employee welfare...|$|E
