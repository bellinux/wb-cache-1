50|$|The golden poison frog's skin is densely {{coated in}} an {{alkaloid}} toxin, {{one of a}} number of poisons <b>common</b> to <b>dart</b> frogs (batrachotoxins). This poison prevents its victim's nerves from transmitting impulses, leaving the muscles in an inactive state of contraction, which can lead to heart failure or fibrillation. Alkaloid batrachotoxins can be stored by frogs for years after the frog is deprived of a food-based source, and such toxins do not readily deteriorate, even when transferred to another surface.|$|R

40|$|Narrowing {{the genetic}} base {{available}} for future genetic progress {{is a major}} concern to plant breeders. In order to avoid this, strategies to characterise and protect genetic diversity in regional breeding pools are required. In this study, 89 winter wheat cultivars released in Croatia between 1936 and 2006 were genotyped using 1, 229 DArT (Diversity Array Technology) markers to assess the diversity and population structure. In order to place Croatian breeding pool in a European context, Croatian wheat cultivars were compared to 523 European cultivars from seven countries using a total of 166 <b>common</b> <b>DArT</b> markers. The results show higher genetic diversity in the wheat breeding pool from Central Europe (CE) as compared to that from Northern and Western European (NWE) countries. The most of the genetic diversity was attributable to the differences among cultivars within countries. When the geographical criterion (CE vs. NWE) was applied, highly significant difference between regions was obtained that accounted for 16. 19 % of the total variance, revealing that the Croatian breeding pool represents genetic variation not currently captured in elite European wheat. The current study emphasises the important contribution made by plant breeders to maintaining wheat genetic diversity and suggests that regional breeding is essential to the maintenance of this diversity. The usefulness of open-access wheat datasets is also highlighted...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRegular homomorphisms of {{oriented}} maps essentially {{arise from}} a factorization by a subgroup of automorphisms. This kind of map homomorphism is studied in detail, and generalized {{to the case}} when the induced homomorphism of the underlying graphs is not valency preserving. Reconstruction is treated by means of voltage assignments on angles, {{a natural extension of}} the <b>common</b> assignments on <b>darts.</b> Lifting and projecting groups of automorphisms along regular homomorphisms is studied in some detail. Finally, the split-extension structure of lifted groups is analysed...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{well-defined}} regulatory framework governing {{the approval of}} chemicals for use as pharmaceuticals or release into the environment. Toxicity assessment is thus a major hurdle in the compound discovery pipeline, currently involving large scale animal testing. The search for alternative testing platforms is therefore an important priority. We have developed a convenient, low cost assay utilising the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, to rapidly assess both acute toxicity and developmental and reproductive toxicity (<b>DART).</b> However the <b>worm</b> is protected by a robust cuticle that forms a barrier to chemical uptake. We assessed mutants with altered cuticle properties to identify sensitized strains optimized for toxicity assays. Evaluating the trade-off between increased permeability and reduced fitness identifies bus- 5 (br 19) as the most suitable strain for chemical exposure. We demonstrate the applicability of this assay {{for a range of}} chemicals with differing properties, including a modified exposure protocol for volatile or less soluble compounds. This work enhances the effectiveness of C. elegans for convenient toxicity assessment, which could contribute to a reduction in the use of vertebrates particularly at the crucial early stages of product development. Strains identified in this work will also enhance the sensitivity of C. elegans based drug discovery platforms...|$|R
40|$|Bambara {{groundnut}} (Vigna subterranea (L.) Verdc.) is {{an important}} underutilised legume crop, grown mainly by female subsistence farmers in Africa under traditional low input agricultural systems. Bambara groundnut is known as being of high nutritional value, as an atmospheric nitrogen fixer and to possess high levels of drought, pest and disease tolerance. Bambara groundnut is a predominantly self-pollinated crop and is grown as locally adapted landraces. These are expected to exist as non-identical inbred lines and are generally low yielding. Strategies involving genetic analysis of this species could provide important data for breeding programmes that could enhance food security in Africa. A set of 124 SSR primers designed from different library sources were tested to screen a ‘narrow’ genetic cross (F 3) and a ‘wide’ genetic cross (F 2). The former is a cross between domesticated landraces (DipC and Tiga necaru) while {{the latter is a}} cross between a domesticated landrace and a wild ancestor (DipC and VSSP 11). Residual heterozygosity in the F 3 ‘narrow’ cross was confirmed to be around 25 % based on 33 polymorphic SSR primers, consistent with an F 3 population. A ‘narrow’ cross linkage map was constructed {{for the first time in}} bambara groundnut using 269 polymorphic markers (236 DArT and 33 SSR). The map consisted of 238 markers in 21 linkage groups of two or more linked markers, totalling 608. 1 cM and covering a predicted 54 % of the bambara groundnut genome, although the high marker-marker linkage (at 89 %) suggests a more comprehensive coverage. QTL analysis was carried out for 73 bulked lines of an F 3 population and plants were evaluated for traits in a controlled glasshouse suite and a field trial in Indonesia. Data from single plant analysis of the F 2 generation of this cross grown in a controlled environment glasshouse was also used. Most of the QTLs detected were clustered on linkage groups 1, 4 and 12. Major QTLs for internode length and biomass dry weight were detected on LG 4 and LG 1, respectively, for the FutureCrop glasshouse and field datasets. The highest LOD score of 9. 7 was detected for peduncle length and was located within the confidence interval for a QTL for internode length locus. Marker locus bgPabg- 596774 was detected to be associated with QTL for six traits; node no. /plant, pod no/plant, pod weight, seed no. /plant, seed yield and biomass dry weight, on LG 1 within one LOD score of confidential interval, potentially suggesting pleiotropic effects of a more limited number (or even one) gene(s). One hundred and fifty-nine additional markers (136 DArT and 23 SSR) were used to improve the existing partial ‘wide’ map (141 AFLP, 1 SSR) constructed in an F 2 population of 98 plants. A total of 194 markers were assigned to 20 linkage groups spanning a total of 901 cM. The linkage map derived from the ‘wide’ cross (DipC x VSSP 11) had an expected genome coverage of 79. 6 %. An attempt to combine both maps through 32 common markers allowed a common QTL for days to emergence to be detected in both populations in close association with the <b>common</b> <b>DArT</b> markers 601384 and 601748. The main segregating traits were found to be plant spread, internode length, growth habit, peduncle length, pod weight, seed yield and biomass dry weight. Detecting the same QTL positions for a number of traits, suggested that common underlying genes might be responsible. The QTL-DNA marker associations developed in this study could be used practically for MAS in a future breeding program of this crop. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
