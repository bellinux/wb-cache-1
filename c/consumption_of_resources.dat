40|$|We develop {{mathematical}} and graphical {{models of}} diet selection incorporating {{recent advances in}} digestive physiology – that is, the adaptive modulation of active nutrient transport and gut retention time in response to changes in diet composition – into an explicitly ecological context based on consumer–resource dynamics and optimal foraging theory. The models indicate that gut modulation causes the consumer to treat two resources that are perfectly substitutable (the benefit derived from <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> one <b>resource</b> is a constant fraction of the benefit derived from <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> the second <b>resource)</b> {{as if they are}} antagonistic resources (the benefit derived from <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> either <b>resource</b> alone is greater than the benefit derived from joint <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> both <b>resources).</b> This will tend to favour diet switching and specialization, and also suggests a definitive (laboratory or field) test of the models. The models also suggest that modulation ultimately leads to more efficient use <b>of</b> <b>resources,</b> although it incurs an initial cost. We further cast gut modulation in three ecological scenarios. In the first, the consumer species does not deplete its resources and the optimal modulation strategy is determined by the standing crop <b>of</b> <b>resources.</b> In the second, a fixed population size of consumers results i...|$|R

40|$|In this article, an {{approach}} to the ecological footprint becomes from a microeconomic perspective, speci¯cally from the consumer traditional theory. It is revealed how the <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> goods and services redound in the <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>resources</b> and provoke {{a decrease in the}} wellbeing of the population. In this context, the <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>resources</b> results in costs to all the individuals in the system. That's why the proposed model is one <b>of</b> <b>consumption</b> with externality.
