The difference between adherence of C. albicans to buccal epithelial cells and that to vaginal epithelial cells was significant, as were differ-ences among volunteers.

40|$|Cold {{storage is}} a process applied to seeds {{to enable them to}} {{germinate}} more efficiently. The purpose of this extended essay is to determine whether the duration of cold storage applied affects the germination behavior of a certain type of seed. The hypothesis formed for the claimed research question “How does the duration of cold storage applied for 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks to five groups of scallion seeds affect their behavior of germination under same conditions?” is {{that there would be a}} significant increase in the number <b>of</b> <b>germinated</b> seeds and affect its efficiency as the duration of exposure increases. So as to support the hypothesis, scallion seeds were exposed to cold storage for 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks for five different test groups with the exact same conditions. The duration of cold storage was the independent variable. In order to observe the effect more easily, the seeds were let to germinate in a water bathe then stratified on sterilized soil. The results have showed that there was a significant mean difference between the number <b>of</b> <b>germinated</b> seeds in each test group when the duration of applied cold storage is changed. Therefore, the percentage <b>of</b> <b>germinated</b> seeds can be altered by changing the time interval of cold storage...|$|R

It is shown that exposure <b>of</b> <b>germinating</b> barley to PEE affects radicle emergence without significantly affecting the seeds gross metabolic activity, as quantified by isothermal calorimetry. An exploration of protein 2 -DE profiles of both the embryo and the starchy endosperm showed that, at the studied time scale, no significant changes were found in proteins present at concentrations higher than the detection limit. However, western blotting demonstrated that a-amylase concentration decreases in the PEF-treated seeds. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|A {{strain of}} Bacillus subtilis, UVSSP- 42 - 1, which {{produces}} ultraviolet (UV) -sensitive spores and vegetative cells, {{was found to}} possess germinated spores 25 times more UV resistant than the resting spores. This relative resistance achieved upon germination {{was associated with the}} transition of the heat-resistant refractile spores to the heat-sensitive phase-dark forms. Several generations of outgrowth were required before the cells attained the level of UV sensitivity characteristic of the vegetative cell. The UV sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>germinated</b> spores was compared with other strains with various combinations of mutations affecting deoxyribonucleic acid repair <b>capabilities.</b> The presence <b>of</b> hcr and ssp mutations which are known to abolish the removal of photoproducts from deoxyribonucleic acid did not alter significantly the sensitivity <b>of</b> the <b>germinated</b> forms.

40|$|There {{are many}} reports of {{efficient}} embryo germination and the method has been optimized to suit subtropical low chill genotypes. However the subsequent growth, vigor, and ability <b>of</b> <b>germinated</b> embryos {{to develop and}} survive acclimatization is rarely reported. Many germinated embryos do not survive acclimatization, develop slowly, or fail to develop normally. Methods to improve plant development from in vitro embryo cultures are needed to improve the number of plants that survive to be useful in breeding programs. This paper describes an improved method of embryo rescue that significantly increases embryo shoot and root development that leads to increased plant survival. Four treatments: Woody Plant Media (WPM) solidified with agar, vermiculite with liquid WPM, vermiculite with WPM plus agar, and conventional stratification, were evaluated for embryo growth and subsequent plantlet development and survival for two low-chill peach and one low-chill nectarine cultivar. Highly significant improvements were found for shoot and root development <b>of</b> seedlings <b>germinated</b> in vermiculite based media compared to embryos germinated in conventional agar-based media.

40|$|Two new fluorescent-labelling {{techniques}} for studying peptide transport are described. A peptide transport {{system has been}} demonstrated in a higher plant tissue, the scutellum <b>of</b> <b>germinating</b> barley embryos. This system has been extensively characterized, and found to have many similarities to peptide transport systems in microorganisms and mammalian tissues. Evidence has also been obtained {{for the existence of}} a peptide transport system in the membrane of an intracellular organelle, possibly the vacuole. Peptide transport is an active process and appears to require the production of a proton gradient across the plasmalemma. Disruption of the proton gradient not only inhibits peptide transport, but also causes general exodus of amino acids from the embryo and affects amino acid metabolism. Considerable pools of small peptides have been detected in both the endosperm and embryo <b>of</b> the <b>germinating</b> barley grain. The concentrations of peptides achieved in the endo sperm are of the right order of magnitude for the efficient operation of the peptide transport system. It seems that the uptake of small peptides by the scutellum <b>of</b> <b>germinating</b> barley embryos is of considerable importance in the transfer of nitrogen from the endosperm to the embryo during the iLobilization of zhe protein storage reserves...|$|R
