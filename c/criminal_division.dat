5|$|In 2010, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) audited Chipotle's Minneapolis restaurants, {{and found}} that some {{employees}} had been hired using fraudulent documents. In December, Chipotle fired 450 employees from its Minneapolis restaurants {{as a result of}} the audit, resulting in protests by local groups. In February 2011, ICE expanded the audit to include 60 restaurants in Virginia and Washington, D.C. which resulted in 40 workers being fired. In April 2011, the <b>criminal</b> <b>division</b> of the Attorney General's office in Washington, D.C., joined the case, and ICE agents began interviewing employees at 20 to 25 restaurants in other locations, such as Los Angeles and Atlanta. In response to the government investigations, Chipotle hired former director of ICE Julie Myers Wood and high-profile attorneys Robert Luskin and Gregory B. Craig.|$|E
5|$|On 11 November 2009, Wiens {{was found}} guilty of the murder of El-Sherbini and the {{attempted}} murder of Okaz, and sentenced to life imprisonment. Judge Birgit Wiegand stated that the court had also found that Wiens's deeds constituted a heinous crime, because they were committed in front of a child, against two people, in a court of law, and fulfilled the murder criterion of treacherousness, such as hatred against foreigners. It meant that Wiens received the maximum sentence for this crime. Wiens appealed the conviction; however, the appeal was rejected by the Federal Court of Justice. In a decision published on 18 June 2010, the fifth <b>criminal</b> <b>division</b> of the court of justice in Leipzig stated that the appeal on points of law was unfounded and confirmed the verdict and sentence of the regional court as final matter of criminal law.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Criminal</b> <b>Division</b> was {{established}} in 1966 with the merger of the Court of Criminal Appeal into the Court of Appeal. It hears all appeals from the Crown Court which are {{in connection with a}} trial on indictment (i.e. with a jury) and where the Crown Court has sentenced a defendant committed from the Magistrates' Court. It also exercises the jurisdiction to order the issue of writs of venire de novo. The <b>Criminal</b> <b>Division,</b> while bound by the Supreme Court, is more flexible with binding itself, due to the heightened stakes in a case where a possible penalty is a prison sentence. The Division is led by the Lord Chief Justice, currently Sir Ian Burnett, assisted by the Vice-President of the <b>Criminal</b> <b>Division,</b> currently Lady Justice Hallett.|$|E

25|$|Although the Lord Chief Justice {{is senior}} to the Master of the Rolls, the Civil Division is much broader in scope than the <b>Criminal</b> <b>Division.</b> With only three judges {{on the bench}} (rather than five or more in the Supreme Court), this allows the Master of the Rolls huge {{opportunity}} for shaping the common law and, most notably, Lord Denning {{made the most of}} this potential.|$|E
