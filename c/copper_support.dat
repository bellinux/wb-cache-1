5000|$|Hendrick van Balen or Hendrick van Balen I (c. 1573-1575 in Antwerp [...] - [...] 17 July 1632 in Antwerp) was a Flemish Baroque {{painter and}} stained glass designer.

5000|$|A quench is an {{abnormal}} termination of magnet operation {{that occurs when}} part of the superconducting coil enters the normal (resistive) state. This can occur because the field inside the magnet is too large, {{the rate of change}} of field is too large (causing eddy currents and resultant heating in the <b>copper</b> <b>support</b> matrix), or a combination of the two. More rarely a defect in the magnet can cause a quench. When this happens, that particular spot is subject to rapid Joule heating from the enormous current, which raises the temperature of the surrounding regions. This pushes those regions into the normal state as well, which leads to more heating in a chain reaction. The entire magnet rapidly becomes normal (this can take several seconds, {{depending on the size of}} the superconducting coil). This is accompanied by a loud bang as the energy in the magnetic field is converted to heat, and rapid boil-off of the cryogenic fluid. The abrupt decrease of current can result in kilovolt inductive voltage spikes and arcing. Permanent damage to the magnet is rare, but components can be damaged by localized heating, high voltages, or large mechanical forces. In practice, magnets usually have safety devices to stop or limit the current when the beginning of a quench is detected. If a large magnet undergoes a quench, the inert vapor formed by the evaporating cryogenic fluid can present a significant asphyxiation hazard to operators by displacing breathable air.|$|E

40|$|A {{corrosion}} product rarely {{reported in}} the literature has been found on the <b>copper</b> <b>support</b> of three miniature paintings of the 17 th and 18 th centuries. This product, which has been identified as dicoppertrihydroxyformate (Cu 2 (OH) 3 HCOO), is an unusual basic copper formate found on copper artifacts. The identification and characterization of dicoppertrihydroxyformate was carried out directly over the corroded surface of the objects, using a nondestructive approach, which combines the integrated use of various microanalytical techniques. Using this approach, it was possible to obtain a set of new reference data about the natural form of Cu 2 (OH) 3 HCOO, that will enable its unambiguous identification in other similar objects.

40|$|In this work, {{we present}} the results of {{two-dimensional}} radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of a hohlraum target whose outgoing radiation is used to produce a homogeneously ionized carbon plasma for ion-beam stopping measurements. The cylindrical hohlraum with gold walls is heated by a frequency-doubled (λ_l = 526. 5 μ m) 1. 4 ns long laser pulse with the total energy of E_l = 180 J. At the laser spot, the peak matter and radiation temperatures of, respectively, T ≈ 380 eV and T_r ≈ 120 eV are observed. X-rays from the hohlraum heat the attached carbon foam with a mean density of ρ_C = 2 mg/cm^ 3 to a temperature of T ≈ 25 eV. The simulation shows that the carbon ionization degree (Z ≈ 3. 75) and its column density stay relatively stable (within variations of about ± 7 %) long enough to conduct the ion-stopping measurements.
