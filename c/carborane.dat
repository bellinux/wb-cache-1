5000|$|<b>Carborane</b> acid {{was first}} {{discovered}} and synthesized by Professor Christopher Reed {{and his colleagues}} in 2004 at the University of California, Riverside. Prior to <b>carborane</b> acid's discovery, the long-standing record of “strongest acids as single isolable compounds” was held by the two superacids, fluorosulfonic acid and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, with pKas of −14 and −16 respectively. The parent molecule from which <b>carborane</b> acid is derived, an icosahedral <b>carborane</b> anion, , was first synthesized at DuPont in 1967 by Walter Knoth. Research into this molecules properties was put on hiatus until the mid 1980s when the Czech group of boron scientists, Plešek, Štíbr, and Heřmánek improved the process for halogenation of <b>carborane</b> molecules. These findings were instrumental in developing the current procedure for <b>carborane</b> acid synthesis.

5000|$|<b>Carborane</b> acids {{differ from}} {{classical}} superacids in being well-defined one component substances. In contrast, classical superacids are often mixtures of a Brønsted acid and Lewis acid (e.g. HF/SbF5). [...] Despite being the strongest acid, the boron-based <b>carborane</b> acids {{are described as}} being [...] "gentle", cleanly protonating weakly basic substances without further side reactions. Whereas conventional superacids decompose fullerenes due to their strongly oxidizing Lewis acidic component, <b>carborane</b> acid {{has the ability to}} protonate fullerenes at room temperature to yield an isolable salt. This property is also what makes <b>carborane</b> acid the first superacid that can be stored in a bottle. Other comparable superacids, such as fluorosulfuric acid or hydrofluoric acid, readily donate protons in a similar way to <b>carborane</b> acid, but leave behind incredibly corrosive conjugate bases that are highly reactive and can even degrade glass by breaking down the protonated O-Si-O bond. <b>Carborane</b> acid's remarkably stable conjugate base allows it to be contained easily because it does not react in this manner.|$|E

40|$|Seventeen {{compounds}} {{including the}} parent ortho-, meta- and para-carboranes and derivatives of ortho-carborane were investigated for luminescence in cyclohexane and dichloromethane solutions.

5000|$|There {{are many}} {{uses for the}} boron-based <b>carborane</b> acid. The first {{is that it can}} add an octane kick to {{gasoline}} through a process called hydrocarbon cracking. Hydrocarbon cracking involves the reaction between acids and hydrocarbons from oil. This reaction increases the octane levels of gasoline by breaking the oil molecular into octane. The second usage of <b>carborane</b> acids is that it can help make vitamins digestible due to its strong acidity.
