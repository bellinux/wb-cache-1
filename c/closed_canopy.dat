25|$|The PZL.19 was {{designed}} by Jerzy Dąbrowski and Franciszek Misztal in 1931. The plane was of a modern construction, an all-metal cantilever low-wing monoplane with a fixed landing gear and a <b>closed</b> <b>canopy.</b> The crew of two sat in tandem, there also could be fitted one passenger seat behind. It was powered by a 120hp de Havilland Gipsy III straight engine. Three aircraft were built in 1932, the first was flown in May 1932 by Bolesław Orliński. They carried registration SP-AHH, SP-AHI and SP-AHK.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{habitats}} in the park. Brachystegia woodland, otherwise known as Miombo Woodland, covers around 70% of Kasanka’s surface area, interspersed with grassy dambos. It is very rich in tree species and in many places forms a half <b>closed</b> <b>canopy</b> but also supports a well-developed herbaceous stratum. A high frequency of fires removes this stratum and young saplings and leads to Miombo Woodland with large, widely separated trees. Decades of “early burning” in the park have resulted in more natural Miombo with a strong presence of young trees and thicket species.|$|E

50|$|Woodlot is {{a closely}} related American term, {{which refers to}} a stand of trees {{generally}} used for firewood.

25|$|Along {{the middle}} and lower reaches, the forest is secondary, betraying the {{heritage}} of banana farms and slash-and-burn practises used historically in this area. Today much of this area is protected as the Payne's Creek National Park. Here, relatively dense jungle canopy has returned, resulting in a <b>closed</b> <b>canopy</b> of approximately 15 to 20 metres in height. Yellow bay cedar and other significant sized broadleaf species abound, along with numerous tropical vines and thorny undergrowth flora. A machete is essential for exploration even where there is an established trail. Black howler monkey troops are plentiful, each troop maintaining a home range of 40,000 to 70,000 square metres in this forest.|$|E
500|$|The {{watershed}} lies {{partly in}} the Coast Range ecoregion and partly in the Willamette Valley ecoregion {{designated by the}} U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The historic lower Balch Creek watershed through the 1880s {{was a mixture of}} open water, wetlands, grassland, and forest, while above the flood plain the watershed consisted of <b>closed</b> <b>canopy</b> forest. People who settled here in the 19thcentury logged much of this forest and filled the wetlands. In 2002, aerial photographs showed that buildings, parking lots, shoreline structures, and other cleared areas covered most of the lower floodplain. On the other hand, hill forests protected from major disturbance covered about 65percent of the watershed.|$|E

Mixed in {{with this}} forest habitat are box-trees (Buxus hildebrandtii) and African olives (Olea europaea africana). This francolin {{has been found}} in secondary woodland, box-tree woodlands (Buxus hildebrandtii), and acacia woodland (Acacia seyal). It is also known to venture into more open woodland and wadis following the breeding season. Much of the bird's African juniper forest habitat [...] has been damaged or destroyed due to human usage; the ability of this dead woodland to support the Djibouti francolin remains unknown, although some juveniles have been seen in it. It is believed that the birds are reacting to the destruction of their juniper habitat by trying to find habitat as close to it as possible. It has been noted that due to the decline of the juniper, Buxus hildebrandtii is now the dominant tree in areas most frequently inhabited by the francolin.|$|E

2500|$|When {{images are}} {{acquired}} from locations with large differences in openness (for example, <b>closed</b> <b>canopy</b> locations and canopy gaps) {{it is essential}} to control camera exposure. If the camera is allowed to automatically adjust exposure (which is controlled by aperture and shutter speed), the result is that small openings in closed conditions will be bright, whereas openings of the same size in open conditions will be darker (for example, canopy areas around a gap). This means that during image analysis the same-sized holes will be interpreted as [...] "sky" [...] in a closed-canopy image and [...] "canopy" [...] in the open-canopy image.
