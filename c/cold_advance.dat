Roslyn reached peak winds of 145 mph (230 km/h) 48 hours after attaining hurricane status, while located about [...] southwest of Manzanillo, Colima; that made it the strongest hurricane of the season. Roslyn maintained peak intensity for about 18 hours, during which it turned more to the northwest {{in response to a}} powerful <b>advancing</b> <b>cold</b> front.

40|$|Extended {{empirical}} {{orthogonal function}} analysis {{is used to}} describe the evolution of large-scale spatial patterns associated with high-frequency synoptic variability over the region of South America. Prior to computing the modes the data are filtered using a band-pass Lanczos filter to retain fluctuations having periods in the range of 2 - 15 days. The principal modes for sea levei pressure are computed for each year during the period 1981 - 1995. The patterns for other variables, such as 925 -hPa u and v wind components, 925 -hPa temperature and 500 -hPa geopotential height, are obtained by computing the correlations between the principal component time series of a determined sea levei pressure mode (time series of the amplitudes) and the time series of filtered anomalies at each grid point for the other variables. The evolution depicted by the first mode contains features commonly observed associated with major coldair outbreaks over South America. These include: a major amplification of the upper-aír wave pattern, with an amplifying ridge in the eastern Pacific moving eastward over extreme southern South America; an intensifying surface anticyclone west of Chile, which moves east-southeastward as it approaches the Andes mountains, and then moves north-northeastward toward lower latitudes over the continent; a <b>cold</b> front that <b>advances</b> northward with time reaching the western Amazon Basin; and a strong reversal in the meridionallow-level flow from northerly winds to southerly winds as the <b>cold</b> front <b>advances</b> northward over the continent.

40|$|W hy does it rain? If {{a parcel}} of air rises, it expandsin the lower pressure, cools, and thereforecondenses {{moisture}} in the parcel, producing cloud and, ultimately, rainfall—or perhaps snowfall. So a key ingredient is certainly the many and varied mechanisms for causing air to rise. These range from orographic uplifting as air flows over mountain ranges, {{to a host of}} instabilities in the atmosphere that arise from unequal heating of the atmosphere, to po-tential vorticity dynamics. The instabilities include those that result directly in vertical mixing, such as convective instabilities, to those associated with the meridional heating disparities that give rise to baroclinic instabilities and the ubiquitous fronts and low and high pressure weather systems. Thus cold air pushing underneath warmer air (<b>advancing</b> <b>cold</b> front) or warm air gliding over <b>colder</b> air (<b>advancing</b> warm front), and so on, can all provide opportuni-ties for air to rise. Henceforth we use the term “storm” as shorthand for all the potential disturbances that create upward motion in the atmosphere, since many will in fact be thunderstorms, or extratropical cy-clones manifested as rain- or snowstorms. Although the distribution of these events around the globe vary with climate, the basic mechanisms for causing air to rise presumably do not in and of themselves change. They need to be better understood and modeled, but from a societal standpoint, the fact that their relative importance can change with time is a significant but often overlooked consequence. Similarly, mechanisms involved in the actual con-densation process are important. After a cloud forms, if the cloud droplets grow large enough (> 4 -µm di-ameter) or the air cools sufficiently for the cloud drop-lets to freeze, then rain and snow form, respectively. The microphysics of cloud droplets matters. Human interference, such as putting various kinds of pollutants and aerosols into the atmosphere, can make important differences in the number and size of cloud droplets, precipitation formation, within-cloud heat-ing, and the cloud’s lifetime (e. g., Rosenfeld 2000...|$|R
