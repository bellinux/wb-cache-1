40|$|Rotary disc mowers {{are capable}} of much higher {{throughput}} than traditional mowers, {{and as a result}} have much higher power demands. With the recent increasing popularity of rotary mowers and the ever-increasing size of high-capacity forage and haying equipment, manufacturers are offering larger mowers with higher power demands. A disc mower <b>cutterbar</b> requires a significant amount of the total implement power, and little research has been performed relating to the study of power requirements and material movement. The objectives of this research were to develop a means of measuring <b>cutterbar</b> power requirements and material flow, and to perform a statistical design of the mower in operation. Using these results, {{it may be possible to}} offer insight into changes that could be considered in the design of rotary mower cutterbars. Two types of experiments were performed on a prototype disc mower. Both experiments were performed in both alfalfa and light grass, at three different ground speeds, and at three different disc rotational velocities. The first experiment consisted of measuring the power requirements and specific energy of three individual discs on the prototype <b>cutterbar.</b> The rotational direction of the three adjacent discs investigated produce converging and diverging cutting zones. Measurements were made by means of instrumented drive hubs, each with individual onboard data acquisition systems. Average power measurements recorded by each instrumented hub were found to be approximately 2. 45 and 3. 31 kW for alfalfa and grass, respectively. Likewise, average specific energy measurements for alfalfa and grass ranged from 1. 83 to 5. 74 kW•h/t, respectively. The second experiment involved the optical flow field calculation from high-speed videos captured of the <b>cutterbar</b> in operation. A phase-based optical flow algorithm was applied to videos captured to study material flow across the <b>cutterbar.</b> An analytical model and two regression models were developed to describe and predict the <b>cutterbar</b> specific energy at the converging and diverging zones. The analytical model was based on the cutting and transport processes as performed by the rotating discs, as well as the zero-load power. The model included the results of the averaged material flow vector angles. The regression models were fitted to the experimental specific energy results as a function of the different combinations of effects in the experimental design. All three models, which were produced for both the converging and diverging cutting zones, were found with coefficient of determination values between 0. 79 and 0. 96...|$|E

40|$|Field {{measurements}} of header losses while harvesting different grain crops, mainly wheat and barley, were performed in Sweden during the harvesting season in 1986. In addition, divider losses in rapeseed were studied on one occasion. Different settings, e. g. reel speed index, reel height, stubble height and forward speed were varied. The header losses were collected manually, cleaned and weighed. The moisture content was measured {{to make it}} possible to convert the sample weights to 15 % moisture content (in rapeseed to 18 % water content). At each setting the header losses from a total of 7. 5 m 2 were collected. This area was divided into 15 plots, each of 0. 5 m 2. Sometimes also header losses from the divider area were collected. In rapeseed, the losses were collected in chutes placed in the gap between the crop rows. Nine chutes were placed in three adjacent gaps, three chutes in each. Each chute measured 10 cm x 100 cm. The gap between the rows measured about 25 cm. The header losses were divided into loose kernels and parts of or whole ears. In the experiments performed in seed crops most of the collected losses were ears. The header losses, apart from divider losses, were seldom of any magnitude. In most cases they were less than 50 kg/ha. However, in some cases they exceeded 200 kg/ha. Losses in the divider area were mostly of a more considerable size. In an upright standing crop, divider losses generally were between 150 and 300 kg/ha. In a lodged crop they were more than 1000 kg/ha in some cases. In general, divider losses were about 20 to 40 % of the total header losses. In a lodged crop they could make up more than 60 % of the total header losses. The experiments were unable to reveal whether the header losses, except for the divider losses, were constant along the <b>cutterbar</b> width. Neither could it be established whether there were any differences between different header constructions. Header losses increased rapidly in winter barley with increasing stubble height. This depends on the more or less broken straw that characterizes barley. Only a few experiments were made with different forward speeds. Header losses were generally larger at low speeds (about 0. 5 m/s) than at normal speeds (about 1 m/s). Quite a few experiments were performed with different reel speed indexes. In general, least losses occurred at reel speed indexes between 1. 2 and 1. 6. In some experiments with different reel heights, the largest header losses occurred when the reel was positioned as low as possible. Least header losses occurred when the lowest position of the reel bats were level or slightly below the ears. One experiment with different divider equipment was performed in rapeseed. Divider equipment using a fender bar was not suitable in rapeseed. when this divider was mounted, the divider losses considerably exceeded those of the torpedo divider and vertical <b>cutterbar.</b> No particular difference occurred between the torpedo divider and the vertical <b>cutterbar.</b> With the vertical <b>cutterbar</b> mounted, losses tended to decrease with increasing forward speed...|$|E
40|$|Durante a colheita do arroz irrigado ocorrem perdas e danos físicos e fisiológicos às sementes. No final da década de oitenta, surgiram as plataformas recolhedoras, que retiram ou arrancam o grão ao invés de cortar a panícula, porém, pouco se conhece a respeito dos danos físicos e fisiológicos que este sistema de plataforma pode causar às sementes. Este trabalho teve por objetivo avaliar os danos mecânicos causados às sementes dos cultivares de arroz BR-IRGA 409 e BR-IRGA 410, por três formas de colheita: (a) colheita manual e trilha mecânica; (b) colheita com plataforma de corte; (c) colheita com plataforma recolhedora. Quando a colheita foi mecânica, realizou-se a coleta das amostras diretamente no graneleiro. O delineamento {{experimental}} foi blocos ao acaso, com seis repetições. Os resultados demonstraram que as sementes de arroz irrigado dos cultivares estudados não apresentaram diferenças significativas em suas qualidades físicas e fisiológicas, quando colhidas com plataforma de corte e com a plataforma recolhedora. Estes dois métodos de colheita, porém, apresentaram danos significativamente maiores quando comparados à colheita manual e trilha mecânica. During irrigated rice harvesting occur {{losses and}} physical and phisiological seed damage. Late 80 's, appeared the strippers headers that strip the grain, instead of cutting the spike. However, little is know about physical and phisiological seed damage by harvest header. The {{objective of this}} work was to evaluate the mechanical damage caused to BR-IRGA 409 and BR-IRGA 410 rice cultivars by three harvesting methods: (a) manual harvesting and mechanical strip; (b) <b>cutterbar</b> harvesting and; (c) stripper header harvesting. Samples were collected directly in the grain tank when the harvest was mechanical. The experimental design was randomized blocks with six replications. Results demonstrated that the rice seeds of the studied variety didn't showed significant differences in physical and phisiological in seed quality when harvested by <b>cutterbar</b> or stripper header. These two harvesting forms, however, showed significantly seed damages when compared to manual harvesting and mechanical strip...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The EU Common {{agricultural}} policy stimulates farmers {{to grow more}} energy crops, including short rotation coppice and other perennial crops. There are other resources of bioenergy as agricultural residue and peat. Peat {{can be used as}} an additive for manufacturing of solid biofuel, because it improves the density, durability of stalk material briquettes (pellets) and avoids corrosion of boilers. Naturally herbaceous biomass is a material of low density (20 - 60 kg m- 3) and not favorable for transportation on long distances. Baling can increase the bulk density to 100 - 200 kg m- 3. The main conditioning operation before biomass compacting is shredding. The shredder <b>cutterbar</b> has to be designed with friction energy losses decreased to minimum. According to this mainly stalk material cutting properties have to be investigated. Experimental investigation of common reed stalk conditioning properties as different cutting methods can characterize maximum of energy consumption in these operations for all groups of stalk materials in Latvia, because reeds have higher tensile strength (~ 200 N mm- 2) and accordingly other strength parameters...|$|E

Chapter Summary: In recent years, increased harvest loss for soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr. ] due to low forming pods {{has been noted}} in southern Minnesota. These harvesting losses come from {{the inability of the}} <b>cutterbar</b> on harvesting equipment to be operated close enough to the soil surface to gather low formed pods. In order to better understand the effects of management strategy on height and nodal characteristics and their relation to lowest pod height, studies were conducted in the southern Minnesota region in 2008 and 2009 to investigate plant density, relative maturity, row width, mulch color, and stand reduction. Increasing population density from 19 to 43 plants m- 2 increased the height of the lowest pod from 12. 2 to 15. 8 cm. The relative maturity of soybean varieties also affected the height of the lowest pod, increasing it from 10. 9 to 18. 8 cm going from a late MG 0 and a late MG II variety. Changes in row width revealed there was no significant effect on the height of the lowest pod. Red colored mulch produced a significantly higher lowest pod height at 14. 7 cm compared to no mulch which had a height of 13. 0 cm. Stand reduction studies revealed that lowest pod height could be reduced from 15. 9 to 11. 5 cm when population was reduced from 43 to 19 plants m- 2 as late as R 3. Only population density was found to affect LPH and internode length simultaneously, so the impacts seen on LPH {{do not appear to be}} primarily working through differences in internode length...|$|E
