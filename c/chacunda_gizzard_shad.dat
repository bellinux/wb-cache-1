40|$|Abstract. —Competition with <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> Dorosoma cepedianum {{has been}} shown to {{influence}} survival of larval bluegills Lepomis macrochirus as well as growth and size structure of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, which prey on these planktivorous species. However, little is known about how the presence of <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> influences bluegills beyond the larval stage. We examined bluegill–gizzard shad interactions across 10 reservoirs with and 10 without <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> to de-termine direct and indirect effects of <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> on bluegill population size structure. In the presence of <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad,</b> bluegills exhibited smaller adult (. 3 years old) size structure. Benthic invertebrate densities were higher in non-gizzard shad reservoirs, which may have contributed to increased bluegill growth in these systems. In contrast, zooplankton densities were similar in reservoirs with and without <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad.</b> Turbidity was higher in reservoirs with <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad,</b> which may have reduced foraging success and growth of bluegill. Finally, higher bluegill densities occurred in reservoirs with <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad,</b> which may have resulted from decreased largemouth bass predation due to <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> availability as alternative prey. These results demonstrate that the presence of <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> is associated with reduced bluegill growth rates and adult size structure and that mechanisms other than direct competition for food resources may be responsible. <b>Gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> Dorosoma cepedianum is a com-mon freshwater fish species that can predominate fish biomass in many central and southern U. S. reservoirs (Johnson et al. 1988; DeVries and Stein 1992; Stein et al. 1995).

40|$|Abstract. —Food webs in {{northern}} temperate lakes frequently exhibit tightly linked interactions between adjacent trophic levels {{that lead to}} top-down effects from piscivores to phytoplankton. To determine if these interactions occur in reservoirs dominated by an omnivorous planktivore, <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> Dorosoma cepedianum, we experimentally quantified crustacean zooplankton and phytoplankton responses to age- 0 <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> (23 - 90 mm total length) at four <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> densities across three reservoirs, each with a different level of crustacean zooplankton productivity. Age- 0 <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> exerted strong top-down effects on crustacean zooplankton, eliminating it from most enclosures within 2 weeks. This decline in crustacean zooplankton {{did not lead to}} increases in phytoplankton unless Daphnia spp. were initially abundant. As detritivores, <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> can remain abundant when planktonic food resources are depleted. This trophic decoupling probably allows <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> to structure reservoir food webs by overconsumption of crustacean zooplank-ton, which in turn may compromise recruitment of sport fishes with zooplanktivorous larvae. In our view, the potential for increasing crustacean zooplankton density by controlling <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> with stocked predators will be limited to reservoirs where age- 0 <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> density can be reduced below 10 fish/m 3 and where daily zooplankton productivity exceeds 220 mg/nv...|$|R

An open-water planktivore, the <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> (Borosorna cepedianurn), can drive complex interactions among fish and zooplankton in Ohio reservoirs. In Kokosing Lake, crustacean zooplankton density declined to near zero immediately after larval <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> abundance peaked during 1987 and 1988. This decline can be attributed to increased death rates, due to predation, and to reduced number of eggs per cladoceran. in an enclosure 1 exclosure experiment, young-of-year <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> at lake densities significantly reduced density sf crustacean zooplankton and rotifers within 2 wk. In addition, phytoplankton that were edible to zooplankton were reduced in enclosures, likely due to a combination of direct herbivory by <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> and reduced nutrient availability due to uptake by the growing <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad.</b> <b>Gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> not only directly influenced zooplankton via predation, they also indirectly affected zooplankton by reducing phytoplankton abundance.

40|$|Abstract. — Piscivores {{can control}} prey populations in north {{temperate}} lakes, leading to increased zooplankton and reduced phytoplankton. In reservoirs with <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> Dorosoma cepedianum, an omnivorous planktivore, this cascade occurs with lower probability because while this fish is shorter than 60 mm in total length (TL) it readily consumes zooplankton but also switches to phytoplankton and detritus. Prospects for <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> control probably hinge on piscivore consumption of age- 0 individuals. Hence, we quantified capture efficiency of hybrids of striped bass Morone saxatilis × white bass M. chrysops (small: 190 – 250 mm, TL; large: 310 – 360 mm, TL) {{when combined with}} three <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> size-groups (of five possible, ranging 40 – 120 mm) in a 500 -L aquarium. Small hybrid striped bass selected 40 -mm <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> but preferred neither 60 -mm nor 80 -mm prey. Large hybrid striped bass demonstrated no selection for 40 – 120 -mm <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad.</b> We incorporated these data into a bioenergetics model to evaluate whether hybrid striped bass could sufficiently reduce abundance of age- 0 <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> in Ohio reservoirs to permit increased zooplankton, thereby improving the potential for resident sport fish recruitment in reservoirs. Hybrid striped bass potentially increased larval sport fish occurrence only when they were stocked at high densities (≥ 350 fish/ha or ≥ 22 kg/ha) coupled with age- 0 <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> suffering low natural mortality and occurring at an intermediate peak density of 25 fish/m 3 or less.

Individual esocids (150 - 225 mm in total length) were combined with single-species groups (N = 15) of optimal-sized prey (25 - 30 % of predator length for bluegills, 37 - 43 % for fathead minnows, and 30 - 36 % for <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad).</b> Capture ability {{did not differ}} among esocids; however, mean captures per strike were higher for fathead minnow (0. 67) and <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> (0. 78) than for bluegill (0. 14).

Because size and abundance of juvenile <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> Dorosoma cepedianum determines, in large part, {{their effects on}} zooplankton abundance and sport-fish recruitment, we investigated recruitment of larval <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> to the juvenile stage. We hypothesized that larval survival would correlate positively with availability of small (< 0. 40 mm) zooplankton and reservoir productivity and would dictate abundance of individuals reaching the juvenile stage. In downstream and upstream areas of four Ohio reservoirs ranging from mesotrophic to hypereutrophic, we evaluated larval <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> success by comparing hatch, growth, and survival of weekly cohorts of larvae with availability of small zooplankton, and then we determined whether larval success could predict juvenile <b>gizzard</b> <b>shad</b> size and abundance. Total larval hatch abundance increased with reservoir productivity and was higher upstream than downstream. Weekly cohorts that produced abundant survivors reflected not only high hatch but also high survival in upstream areas during periods of abundant small zooplankton. Overall, larval hatch and survival predicted juvenile abundance but not juvenile size. Juvenile abundance increased with reservoir productivity, particularly in upstream areas, whereas juvenile size reflected the combined influence of juvenile abundance and reservoir productivity.

Larvae (n = 10) fed for 1 h on zooplankton assemblages that varied in size, after which all larvae and remaining zooplankton were preserved.
