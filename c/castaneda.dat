5|$|As the fog lifted, <b>Castañeda</b> sent Smither {{to request}} a meeting between the two commanders. Smither was {{promptly}} arrested by the Texians, who were suspicious of his presence among the Mexican soldiers. Nevertheless, Moore agreed to meet <b>Castañeda.</b> Moore explained that his followers no longer recognized the centralist government of Santa Anna and instead remained faithful to the Constitution of 1824, which Santa Anna had repudiated. <b>Castañeda</b> revealed that he shared their federalist leanings, {{but that he was}} honor-bound to follow orders.|$|E
5|$|In San Antonio de Béxar, Ugartechea asked Dr. Launcelot Smither, a Gonzales {{resident}} in town on personal business, to help <b>Castañeda</b> convince the settlers to follow orders. When Smither arrived on October 1, {{he met with}} militia captain Mathew Caldwell to explain that the soldiers meant no harm if the settlers would peacefully relinquish the cannon. Caldwell instructed Smither to bring <b>Castañeda</b> to the town the following morning to discuss the matter. At roughly the same time, Moore called a war council, which quickly voted to initiate a fight. It is unclear whether the war council was aware that Caldwell had promised <b>Castañeda</b> safe passage to Gonzales the next morning.|$|E
5|$|On September 27, 1835, a {{detachment}} of 100 dragoons, led by Francisco de <b>Castañeda,</b> left San Antonio de Béxar, carrying an official order for Ponton to surrender the cannon. <b>Castañeda</b> had {{been instructed to}} avoid using force if possible. When the troops neared Gonzales on September 29, {{they found that the}} settlers had removed the ferry and all other boats from the Guadalupe River. On {{the other side of the}} swiftly moving river waited eighteen Texians. Albert Martin, captain of the Gonzales militia, informed the soldiers that Ponton was out of town, and until his return the army must remain on the west side of the river.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{widespread}} popularity of his works, some critics questioned {{the validity of}} <b>Castaneda's</b> books as early as 1969. In a series of articles, R. Gordon Wasson, who had made psychoactive mushrooms famous, and had originally praised <b>Castaneda's</b> work, questioned the accuracies of <b>Castaneda's</b> botanical claims.|$|R

50|$|It was now {{the turn}} of the Argentines to counterattack. Major Carrizo-Salvadores manoeuvred <b>Castañeda's</b> {{reinforced}} platoon to close with 4 and 5 Platoons and meanwhile under the direction of an NCO, part of <b>Castañeda's</b> platoon converged on the British aid post. Colour Sergeant Brian Faulkner, seeing that more than 20 wounded Paras on the western slopes of the mountain were about to {{fall into the hands of}} one of the sections of <b>Castañeda's</b> platoon, deployed anyone fit enough to defend the British Regimental Aid Post.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{the state}} of anarchy being {{experienced}} by the city, Belgrano's death was largely unnoticed. The only newspaper of the time to note his death was El Despertador Teofilantrópico, written by Francisco de Paula <b>Castañeda,</b> and there was no government representation at his funeral. Former students of his educative institutions would arrive in the following days with obsequies, when the news started to be known. The following year the political context was less chaotic and Bernardino Rivadavia, who was minister by then, organised a massive state funeral.|$|E
5|$|The Arévalo {{government}} also floated {{the idea of}} a Central American Federation, as being the only way that a democratic government could survive in the region. He approached several leaders of democratic Central American countries, but was rejected by all except <b>Castañeda</b> Castro, the president of El Salvador. The two leaders began talks to build a union, and set up several commissions to look into the issue. In late 1945 they announced the formation of the union, but the formalization of the process got delayed by internal troubles in both countries, and in 1948 the Castro government was toppled in a military coup led by Óscar Osorio.|$|E
5|$|The Book of est is {{a fictional}} {{account of the}} {{training}} created by Werner Erhard, (est), or Erhard Seminars Training, first published in 1976 by Holt, Rinehart and Winston. The book was written by est graduate Luke Rhinehart. Rhinehart is the pen name of writer George Cockcroft. The book was endorsed by Erhard, and includes a foreword by him. Its contents attempts to replicate {{the experience of the}} est training, with the reader being put in the place of a participant in the course. The end of the book includes a comparison by the author between Erhard's methodologies to Zen, The Teachings of Don Juan by Carlos <b>Castaneda,</b> and to Rhinehart's own views from The Dice Man.|$|E

5|$|With no {{easy way}} to cross the river, <b>Castañeda</b> and his men made camp at the highest ground in the area, about 300 yards (300 meters) from the river. Three Texians hurried to bury the cannon, while others {{traveled}} to nearby communities to ask for assistance. By the end of the day, more than 80 men had arrived from Fayette and Columbus. Texian militias generally elected their own leaders, and the men now gathered in Gonzales invoked their right to choose their own captain rather than report to Martin. John Henry Moore of Fayette was elected leader, with Joseph Washington Elliot Wallace and Edward Burleson, both of Columbus, respectively elected second and third in command.|$|E
5|$|The US-based United Fruit Company (UFC) {{was one of}} {{many foreign}} {{companies}} that acquired large tracts of both state land and indigenous land. Manuel Estrada Cabrera, who was president of Guatemala from 1898 to 1920, permitted limited unionization in rural Guatemala, but also made further concessions to the UFC. In 1922, the Communist Party of Guatemala was created, and became a significant influence among urban laborers; however, it had little reach among the rural and Indian populations. In 1929, the Great Depression led to the collapse of the economy and a rise in unemployment, leading to unrest among workers and laborers. Fearing the possibility of a revolution, the landed elite lent their support to Jorge Ubico y <b>Castañeda,</b> who had built a reputation for ruthlessness and efficiency as a provincial governor. Ubico won the election that followed in 1931, in which he was the only candidate.|$|E

It is unclear whether Carlos and Margaret were divorced in 1960, 1973, or not at all, and his death certificate even stated {{he had never been}} married.|$|E

Championing a “separate reality” predicated on an indigenous worldview, <b>Castaneda’s</b> lessons invited transnational middle-class youth to "journey" alongside him to camposcape—an anachronistic and idealized countryside—as a means to escape the bourgeois values of their homelands and find spiritual fulfillment in a timeless and "authentic" Mexico. <b>Castaneda’s</b> work proposed new viable spaces of difference in Mexico, yet inscribed these spaces with a masculinist discourse that served to neutralize the gender trouble within the counterculture movement in both Mexico and the US...|$|R
