40|$|Subtitles are {{captions}} {{displayed at}} the bottom of a cinema or television screen that translate or transcribe the dialogue or narrative. Nigeria and indeed Africa should be a major beneficiary of the subtitles considering the number of ethnic groups in the continent. The emergence of different film industries in countries around Africa has helped in showcasing Africa to the international community. Hence, subtitles came in handy, considering the fact that most viewers cannot understand the language with which the movies were produced. This paper explores the battle for meaning by English subtitles to movies produced in African languages especially the Nigerian film industry. The paper will look at the Hermaneutic Theory of Mass Communication to buttress the relevance of deriving meaning out of movie subtitles. The Hausa and the Yoruba film industries are the subjects of this study because of the large viewership they enjoy by people even outside Nigeria. The research came up as a result of the persistent errors which I have noticed while watching Yoruba and Hausa films with subtitles. Subtitles <b>convey</b> <b>a</b> <b>summary</b> of the dialogues taking place in a movie. Viewers who cannot understand the language used for the dialogue rely on the subtitles to make meaning out of the movie. If they are unable to make meaning out of the subtitles because of some inadequacies as a result of carelessness in the process of production, the aim of having the subtitles is defeated. </p...|$|E

40|$|A {{composite}} indicator is an aggregated index comprising individual performance indicators. Composite indicators integrate {{a large amount}} of information in a format that is easily understood and are therefore a valuable tool for <b>conveying</b> <b>a</b> <b>summary</b> assessment of performance in priority areas. This research investigates the degree to which composite measures are an appropriate metric for evaluating performance in the public sector. Do they reflect accurately the performance of organisations? To what degree are they influenced by the uncertainty surrounding underlying indicators on which they are based? Are they robust and stable over time? The construction of composite measures creates specific methodological challenges that make such questions especially pertinent. We address these through a series of quantitative analyses of panel data relating to healthcare (Star ratings of NHS acute Trusts) and local government (Comprehensive Performance Assessment (CPA) ratings of authorities) in England where composites have been widely used. The creation of a composite comprises a number of important steps, each of which requires careful judgement. These include the specification of the choice of indicators, the transformation of measured performance on individual indicators, the specification of a set of weights on individual indicators, and combining the indicators using aggregation methods or decision rules. We use Monte Carlo simulations to examine the robustness of performance judgements to these different technical choices. We show the extent to which composites provide stable performance rankings of organisations over time and assess whether variations are due to genuine performance improvement or merely the result of random statistical variation. The analysis suggests that the judgements that have {{to be made in the}} construction of the composite can have a significant impact on the resulting score. Technical and analytical issues in the design of {{composite indicator}}s have important policy implications. We highlight the issues which need to be considered in the construction of robust composite indicators so that they can be designed in ways which will minimise the potential for producing misleading performance information which may fail to deliver the expected improvements or even induce unwanted side-effects. performance measurement, performance indicators, composite indicator...|$|R

However, this also poses a great challenge to analyze the behavior and glean insights into the complex, large data. In this paper, we introduce LoyalTracker, a visual analytics system to track user loyalty and switching behavior towards multiple search engines from the vast amount of user log data. We propose a new interactive visualization technique (flow view) based on a flow metaphor, which <b>conveys</b> <b>a</b> proper visual <b>summary</b> {{of the dynamics of}} user loyalty of thousands of users over time. Two other visualization techniques, a density map and a word cloud, are integrated to enable analysts to gain further insights into the patterns identified by the flow view.

40|$|High {{levels of}} {{cooperation}} are {{often cited as}} the primary reasons for the ecological success of social insects (Oster and Wilson, 1978; Hölldobler and Wilson, 1990). In social insects, workers perform a multitude of tasks such as for-aging, nest construction and brood rearing without central control of how work is allocated among individuals (Gor-don, 1996). It {{has been suggested that}} workers choose a task by responding to stimuli gathered from the environment (Robinson, 1992). Response threshold models assume that individuals in a colony vary in the stimulus intensity (re-sponse threshold) at which they begin to perform the corre-sponding task (see Beshers and Fewell (2001)). In (Lichocki et al., 2012), we investigated the limitations of the models of division of labor that base on the response thresholds. This abstract is meant to <b>convey</b> <b>a</b> brief <b>summary</b> of the points we raised in that study. The two most often used models of division of labor are the deterministic response threshold model (DTM; Page Jr and Mitchell (1998)), and the probabilistic response thresh-old model (PTM; Bonabeau et al. (1996)). Both models assume that all workers receive information of the colony needs via commonly perceived stimuli. With the DTM each worker performs the task with the highest positive differ-ence between the stimulus and its own corresponding re-sponse threshold. If all the stimuli are lower than the cor-responding thresholds the worker remains idle. With the PTM the relation between stimulus and threshold is inter-preted as a probability to perform the task. While these re-sponse threshold models are frequently used to explain di-vision of labor in colonies of social insects (Bertram et al., 2003; Graham et al., 2006; Jeanson et al., 2007), no attempts 0) =- * [...] 5 4),-; 6 8 <) 5; 1. @; 0 - 19 -.

40|$|Research into {{automatic}} retina {{image analysis}} {{has become increasingly}} important, not just in ophthalmology but also in other clinical specialities such as cardiology and neurology. In the retina, blood vessels can be directly visualised non-invasively in-vivo, and hence {{it serves as a}} "window" to cardiovascular and neurovascular complications. Biomarker research, i. e. investigating associations between the morphology of the retinal vasculature (as a means of revealing microvascular health or disease) and particular conditions affecting the body or brain could {{play an important role in}} detecting disease early enough to impact on patient treatment and care. A fundamental requirement of biomarker research is access to large datasets to achieve sufficient power and significance when ascertaining associations between retinal measures and clinical characterisation of disease. Crucially, the vascular changes that appear can affect arteries and veins differently. An essential part of automatic systems for retinal morphology quantification and biomarker extraction is, therefore, a computational method for classifying vessels into arteries and veins. Artery-vein classification enables the efficient extraction of biomarkers such as the Arteriolar to Venular Ratio, which is a well-established predictor of stroke and other cardiovascular events. While structural parameters of the retinal vasculature such as vessels calibre, branching angle, and tortuosity may individually convey some information regarding specific aspects of the health of the retinal vascular network, they do not <b>convey</b> <b>a</b> global <b>summary</b> of the branching pattern and its state or condition. The retinal vascular tree can be considered a fractal structure as it has a branching pattern that exhibits the property of self-similarity. Fractal analysis, therefore, provides an additional means for the quantitative study of changes to the retinal vascular network and may be of use in detecting abnormalities related to retinopathy and systemic diseases. In this thesis, new developments to fully automated retinal vessel classification and fractal analysis were explored in order to extract potential biomarkers. These novel processes were tested and validated on several datasets of retinal images acquired with fundus cameras. The major contributions of this thesis include: 1) developing a fully automated retinal blood vessel classification technique, 2) developing a fractal analysis technique that quantifies regional as well as global branching complexity, 3) validating the methods using multiple datasets, and 4) applying the proposed methods in multiple retinal vasculature analysis studies...|$|R

40|$|As {{the faculty}} advisor for the Pittsburgh Undergraduate Review (PUR), a professionally {{refereed}} undergraduate journal devoted to publishing scholarly papers across the disciplines, I found the following passages from Ellen Buckner noteworthy: “It {{is assumed that}} the honors work is an original piece of scholarship and prepared according to accepted standards for a written paper... ” (149); and “the project’s scholarly accomplishment... ” should be <b>conveyed</b> in <b>a</b> <b>summary</b> or abstract (150). I agree that demonstrating scholarly accomplishment is a worthy goal of publishing academic work; I would also emphasize that scholarly accomplishment is different from originality. The significance of this subtle distinction is a central topic of this paper, which includes discussion of whether originality is an appropriate condition for the publication of undergraduate work. Though scholarly accomplishment and originality are different criteria for publication, {{they have in common}} the idea that an author is not merely building on someone else’s ideas; I shall refer to this common feature as the independent character of the work. Note the synthesis making this article a piece of independent work: I am conceiving of this project and composing it on my own; however, it is not original in that the origin of the idea about the importance of a work making a scholarly contribution is someone else’s article. So even if a given work is not original (e. g., this article), it still can make a scholarly contribution by virtue of its being an instance of independent work. I will argue that emphasizing the scholarly contribution of independent but not necessarily original work sharpens our expectations of good, scholarly (undergraduate) work and avoids the pitfalls associated with requiring that work be original to get published. My point does not depend on whether Buckner (among others) and I are merely operating on different definitions of “original. ” My point is that we might be better served by striking the concept of originality as a condition of (undergraduate) publication. Moreover, by replacing originality with independent scholarly contribution as a condition of (undergraduate) publication (and institutional support more broadly), I am not suggesting a merely terminological change. As I will show, these two conditions entail different conceptions of what constitutes scholarly quality. I wonder if originality, though often invoked in scholarly contexts, has come to lack significant content...|$|R
