These streams of gas and dust can cause the nucleus to spin, and even split apart.

5|$|Jupiter-family comets and long-period comets {{appear to}} follow very {{different}} fading laws. The JFCs are active {{over a lifetime}} of about 10,000 years or ~1,000 orbits whereas long-period comets fade much faster. Only 10% of the long-period comets survive more than 50 passages to small perihelion and only 1% of them survive more than 2,000 passages. Eventually most of the volatile material contained in a <b>comet</b> <b>nucleus</b> evaporates, and the comet becomes a small, dark, inert lump of rock or rubble that can resemble an asteroid. Some asteroids in elliptical orbits are now identified as extinct comets. Roughly six percent of the near-Earth asteroids {{are thought to be}} extinct comet nuclei.|$|E
5|$|The {{estimated}} probability of Hale-Bopp's striking Earth in future passages through the inner Solar System is remote, about 2.5×10−9 per orbit. However, {{given that the}} <b>comet</b> <b>nucleus</b> is around 60km in diameter, the consequences of such an impact would be apocalyptic. Weissman conservatively estimates the diameter at 35km; an estimated density of 0.6 g/cm3 then gives a cometary mass of 1.3×1019 g. At a probable impact velocity of 52.5km/s, impact energy can be calculated as 1.9×1032 ergs, or 4.4×109 megatons, about 44 times the estimated energy of the K-T impact event.|$|E
40|$|Because {{of their}} short {{dynamical}} lifetimes, {{the population of}} near-earth asteroids (NEAs) must be resupplied. Two sources have been hypothesized: main-belt asteroids and extinct <b>comet</b> <b>nuclei.</b> A new survey of physical properties for less than 5 kilometers diameter main-belt asteroids reveals that their spin rate and shape distributions {{are similar to those}} of NEAs, as is fully consistent with a main-belt origin for most NEAs. Physical data on <b>comet</b> <b>nuclei</b> are limited.

5|$|Hale–Bopp's orbital {{position}} was calculated as 7.2astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, placing it between Jupiter and Saturn and {{by far the}} greatest distance from Earth at which a comet had been discovered by amateurs. Most comets at this distance are extremely faint, and show no discernible activity, but Hale–Bopp already had an observable coma. An image taken at the Anglo-Australian Telescope in 1993 was found to show the then-unnoticed comet some 13AU from the Sun, a distance at which most comets are essentially unobservable. (Halley's Comet was more than 100 times fainter at the same distance from the Sun.)

25|$|Both ESA and NASA started cooperatively {{developing}} new probes. The NASA project was the Comet Rendezvous Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) mission. The ESA project was the follow-on <b>Comet</b> <b>Nucleus</b> Sample Return (CNSR) mission. Both missions were {{to share the}} Mariner Mark II spacecraft design, thus minimising costs. In 1992, after NASA cancelled CRAF due to budgetary limitations, ESA decided to develop a CRAF-style project on its own. By 1993 {{it was evident that}} the ambitious sample return mission was infeasible with the existing ESA budget, so the mission was redesigned and subsequently approved by the ESA, with the final flight plan resembling the cancelled CRAF mission: an asteroid flyby followed by a comet rendezvous with in-situ examination, including a lander. After the spacecraft launch, Gerhard Schwehm was named mission manager; he retired in March 2014.|$|E
500|$|Results {{from the}} Rosetta and Philae {{spacecraft}} {{show that the}} nucleus of 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko has no magnetic field, which suggests that magnetism may not {{have played a role}} in the early formation of planetesimals.

The missions also provided data that substantially reformed and reconfigured these ideas; for instance, it is now understood that the surface of Halley is largely composed of dusty, non-volatile materials, and that {{only a small portion of}} it is icy.|$|E

New aspects of <b>comet</b> <b>nuclei</b> formation and evolution simulations have been developed by our teams to better describe the physical processes of the origins and evolution of these small bodies. Cometesimal aggregation simulations taking into account the evolution of the cohesive energy by sintering processes during accretion in the Kuiper belt can be used to interpret the layered structure and surface features observed for previous comets [1] and quantify the tensile strengths of these objects. Simulations have been done using up to 50000 cometesimals with sizes ranging from tens to hundreds of meters. A layering of the cohesive strength of the <b>comet</b> <b>nuclei</b> material naturally occurs leading to the presence of a high cohesive core surrounded by less cohesive outer layers. Thermal evolution models of <b>comet</b> <b>nuclei</b> have been rather successful in describing the more recent evolution of these objects. A new quasi- 3 D approach for non-spherically shaped <b>comet</b> <b>nuclei</b> has been developed for the case of 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko's nucleus to analyse the effect of irregular shapes (non-spherical, mountain-like and depression-like features) on its thermal evolution, on the local dust crust formation and the onset of its activity [2]. The results of such simulations are used to derive generic cometary nuclei models to be implemented in the analyses processes of the CONSERT experiment on-board Rosetta that will study the internal dielectric properties and heterogeneities of the nucleus.
