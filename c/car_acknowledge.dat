Bazin’s {{research for the}} article, funded by the AHRC, drew upon only recently discovered archival resources of the Rosenbach Museum and Library, and hence, resources previously unused in analyses of Moore’s work. The paper therefore makes {{a significant contribution to}} understanding of the poem. Bazin used a particularly illuminating entry from one of Moore’s diaries, to suggest that the poem itself is based on her mother’s description of a Chinese plate that she saw in a window display for the Pierce Arrow motor <b>car.</b> <b>Acknowledging</b> its status as commoditised object through its textual sources, ‘Nine Nectarines’, Bazin argues, questions the opposition between the every day and art itself through its method of composition, drawing as it does from the fragments of everyday life...|$|R

5000|$|Telnack's team of designers, known {{collectively as}} [...] "Team Taurus", were {{responsible}} for the 1986 Ford Taurus: a <b>car</b> widely <b>acknowledged</b> as the main reason why Ford Motor Company's turnaround strategy was successful during this period. The Taurus' wind cheating design language influenced everything from the Ford F-150 to the Lincoln Town Car in the 1990s. Lesser known cars like the 1986 Mercury Sable boasted a wind cheating drag coefficient of 0.29. The Sable's light bar grille continued to be a Mercury design hallmark for the next decade. Telnack also helped shape the 1989 Ford Probe and 1993 Lincoln Mark VIII.|$|R
30|$|Mothering, {{which is}} {{understood}} as discourses and practices of emotional labour purported for the preservation, nurturance and training of children for adult life (Hondagneu-Sotelo & Avila, 1997), is intimately linked with care. It is central for the reproduction of inequalities in terms of class-related advantages and disadvantages (Lopez Rodriguez, 2017). Having childcare options means that a woman can decide on becoming a stay-at-home mother, using kin networks, hiring (ethnic/local) help, or taking advantage of institutionalized early childhood education and care (ECEC). Importantly, living in a transnational space often means that women have limited experiences of the welfare systems and social protection schemes in the receiving country, so they may resort to {{using a combination of}} multiple care resources. The choice of childcare provisioning strategy is highly consequential, since it not only determines the professional pathways and social mobility of migrant women but has also paramount influence on the futures (e.g. educational attainment) of migrant children (Turney & Kao, 2009). To reiterate, the focus on <b>CARs</b> <b>acknowledges</b> the interrelationship between structural opportunities and class-subjectivity. We believe that mothers’ desirable position cannot be deduced from her particular role (employment versus stay-at-home), but from the degree of freedom that mothers experience in taking their roles. As such, we do not see either type of motherhood/childcare choice as superior but rather argue that women have distinctive arrays of options in terms of their pre-existing status and CARs.|$|R
40|$|We outline {{a vision}} for an ambitious program to {{understand}} the economy and financial markets as a complex evolving system of coupled networks of interacting agents. This is a completely different vision from that currently used in most economic models. This view implies new challenges and opportunities for policy and managing economic crises. The dynamics of such models inherently involve sudden and sometimes dramatic changes of state. Further, the tools and approaches we use emphasize the analysis of crises rather than of calm periods. In this they respond directly to the calls of Governors Bernanke and Trichet for new approaches to macroeconomic modelling.

30|$|Like {{in other}} areas of social life complex and often {{contingent}} processes of migrants’ capital evaluation and recognition in the immigration country severely impact on the broader situation of mothers representing different social classes. We formulate class analytically here from the perspective of Bourdieu’s forms of capital, and its modes of reproduction (habitus, fields, taste and distinction; Bourdieu, 1986). In doing so, we acknowledge that opportunity structures produce and are produced through individual’s actions that draw differently on capital, assets and resources (=CAR’s, see Savage, Warde, & Devine, 2005). The approach focused on <b>CARs</b> <b>acknowledges</b> the complexity of class in the process of migration, calling for analytical sensitivity to the spatial contexts that pattern the formation and validation of economic, social and cultural capital across various contexts. As Erel and Ryan (2018) argue, such a perspective acknowledges both migrants’ agency and the constraints of national and transnational social structures which result in complex trajectories of social mobility. Empirically, we conceive of working-class positions as those occupations which correspond to blue-collar jobs. Such employment usually does not require formal training and is generally less secure and worse paid. Blue-collar job holders usually possess localized forms of capital and tend to rely on resources from co-ethnics in the destination country or their relatives in the sending country. Middle-class migrants tend to hold white collar jobs, which require formal education. Networks with co-ethnics and their family members in their emigration country are not part of their CARs to the same extent as they are for working-class migrants (Lopez Rodriguez, 2017).|$|R
60|$|And {{that reminds}} me of a trifle. Any time you want to you can glance around the carpet of a Pullman car, and go and pick up a hair-pin; but not to save your life can you get any woman in that <b>car</b> to <b>acknowledge</b> that hair-pin. Now, isn't that strange? But it's true. The woman who has never swerved from {{cast-iron}} veracity and fidelity in her whole life will, when confronted with this crucial test, deny her hair-pin. She will deny that hair-pin before a hundred witnesses. I have stupidly got into more trouble and more hot water trying to hunt up the owner of a hair-pin in a Pullman than by any other indiscretion of my life.|$|R

5000|$|Schwartz {{studied the}} {{fatality}} {{rates of the}} Pinto and several other small cars of the time period.

At the time only 1% of automobile crashes would result in fire and only 4% of fatal accidents involved fire, and only 15% of fatal fire crashes {{are the result of}} rear-end collisions. [...] When considering the overall safety of the Pinto, Schwartz notes that subcompact cars as a class have generally higher fatality risk.

[...] The safety record of the car in terms of fire was average or slightly below average for compacts and all cars respectively. This was considered respectable for a subcompact car. Only when considering the narrow subset of rear-impact, fire fatalities is the car somewhat worse than the average for subcompact <b>cars.</b> While <b>acknowledging</b> this is an important legal point, Schwartz rejects the portrayal of the car as a firetrap.|$|R
40|$|The Base Enivronmental Management System (BEMS) is a Web-based {{application}} program for managing and tracking audits by the Environmental Office of Stennis Space Center {{in conformity with}} standard 14001 of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO 14001). (This standard specifies requirements for an environmental-management system.) BEMS saves time by partly automating what were previously manual processes for creating audit checklists; recording and tracking audit results; issuing, tracking, and implementing corrective-action requests (CARs); tracking continuous improvements (CIs); and tracking audit results and statistics. BEMS consists on an administration module and an auditor module. As its name suggests, the administration module is used to administer the audit. It helps administrators to edit the list of audit questions; edit the list of audit locations; assign manditory questions to locations; track, approve, and edit CARs; and edit completed audits. The auditor module is used by auditors to perform audits and record audit results: It helps the auditors to create audit checklists, complete audits, view completed audits, create <b>CARs,</b> record and <b>acknowledge</b> CIs, and generate reports from audit results...|$|R
5000|$|John Heffernan and Ken Greenley were officially {{retained}} {{to complete}} {{the design of the}} Continental R. They had run the Automotive Design School at the Royal College of Art and headed up their own consultancy, International Automotive Design, based in Worthing, Southern England. Greenley and Heffernan liaised constantly throughout the styling process with Graham Hull. The interior was entirely the work of Graham Hull and the small in house styling team at Rolls Royce. The shape of the car was very different from the somewhat slab sided four-door SZ Rolls-Royce and Bentley vehicles of the time and offered a much improved 0.37 coefficient of drag. The Continental R also featured roof-cut door frames, a necessity to allow easier access into the car which had a lower roofline than its 4-door saloon contemporaries. A subtle spoiler effect was also a feature of the rear. The finished <b>car</b> is widely <b>acknowledged</b> as a very cleverly styled vehicle, disguising its huge dimensions (The Continental R is around 4" [...] longer than a 2013 long wheelbase Mercedes S Class) and a very well proportioned, extremely attractive, car.|$|R
30|$|The aims of this {{systematic}} review were to firstly summarize the alterations in CAR {{in response to}} exercise and determine whether there was sufficient support for its use as an exercise-related biomarker and secondly to provide future recommendations, where warranted, for improving <b>CAR</b> research. We <b>acknowledge</b> {{that many of the}} studies included in this review include confounding variables that may influence the cortisol response above and beyond exercise alone (i.e., hypoxia due to altitude or psychological stress). However, had we limited our review to studies that investigated only the influence of exercise on alterations in CAR without any confounding variables, the number of studies included in the {{systematic review}} would have been zero. The original intent of this review was to conduct a meta-analysis and establish potential effect sizes across exercise contexts. However, as has been discussed, there are significant variations in research methodology, data reduction, populations, and statistics. Therefore, any meta-analyses presented would be inconclusive, if not entirely erroneous. As such, we aim to discuss the current state of CAR in exercise research and provide recommendations for augmenting our current knowledge of this biomarker.|$|R
40|$|Aim: This article aims at {{giving an}} {{overview}} of five ethical problem areas relating to traffic safety, thereby providing a general framework for analysing traffic safety from an ethical perspective and encouraging further discussion concerning problems, policies and technology in this area. Subjects and methods: The problems presented in the article are criminalisation, paternalism, privacy, justice and responsibility, {{and the reasons for}} choosing these are the following. First, they are all important areas in moral philosophy. Second, they are fairly general and {{it should be possible to}} categorise more specific problems under these headings. Ethical aspects of road traffic have not received the philosophical attention they deserve. Every year, more than 1 million people die globally in traffic accidents, and 20 to 50 million people are injured. Ninety per cent of the road traffic fatalities occur in low- and middle-income countries, where it is a growing problem. Politics, economics, culture and technology affect the number of fatalities and injuries, and the measures used to combat deaths in traffic as well as the role of road traffic should be ethically scrutinised. The topics are analysed and discussed from a moral-philosophical perspective, and the discussion includes both theory and applications. Results and conclusion: The author concludes with some thoughts on how the ethical discussion can be included in the public debate on how to save lives in road traffic. People in industrialised societies are so used to road traffic that it is almost seen as part of nature. Consequently, we do not acknowledge that we can introduce change and that we can affect the role we have given road traffic and <b>cars.</b> By <b>acknowledging</b> the ethical aspects of road traffic and illuminating the way the choices society makes are ethically charged, it becomes clear that there are alternative ways to design the road traffic system. The most important general conclusion is that discussion concerning these alternative ways of designing the system should be encouraged...|$|R

Mohan’s parents talk ill of Rishi and sarcastically suggest him to marry Nila since he gave her a ride in the middle of the night. Mohan changes his mind soon and asks Rishi to drop Nila back off at the wedding hall. Rishi gets upset at Mohan and tries to convince him about Nila’s trust but in vain. Nila gives up on Mohan and asks Rishi to leave the place. Rishi leaves the house calling Mohan an [...] "idiot". He offers Nila to drop her off at the wedding hall. But Nila hesitates to go back worrying about her sister’s future. Rishi offers his own house until she finds a place on her own. Nila who is initially skeptical accepts the offer after Rishi’s word that he’ll never mistreat someone in despair.|$|R
