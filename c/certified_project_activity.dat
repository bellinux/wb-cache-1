40|$|AbstractAccording to the USGBC projects’ directory, {{there are}} only Six LEED <b>Certified</b> <b>projects</b> and 17 {{registered}} projects in Egypt. This implies {{the limited number of}} LEED projects in Egypt. That's why most of the empirical studies conducted about LEED Rating System were performed on other markets than the Egyptian one; Accordingly This paper {{is the result of a}} longitudinal study that was performed on Three Egyptian LEED <b>Certified</b> <b>projects</b> as a part of a master thesis research that was submitted to Cairo University in 2013 by the first author where the second and the third author were the main supervisors. The objective of this study was to investigate the implementation of the LEED Rating system credits in Egypt through a comparative analysis of Three Egyptian LEED <b>Certified</b> <b>projects.</b> The results of this study included a classification for the most achieved and targeted credits within the Egyptian market. This study may also contribute to a better understanding of the concept of implementing LEED green building rating system in Egypt and may suggest some recommendations for future studies...|$|R

40|$|Part 2 : Open Source in Business ModelingInternational audienceThere is a {{significant}} relationship between <b>project</b> <b>activity</b> and developer interest on Open Source (OS) <b>projects.</b> Total <b>project</b> <b>activity</b> submission count number can be an indicator for gauging developer interest. The higher the <b>project</b> <b>activity</b> submission of a project is, the larger developer interest in a project. My paper proposed that applying a Submission Multiple Tier (SMT) matrix can detect the impact of developer interest on <b>project</b> <b>activity.</b> Results showed more volume of OS projects with low <b>project</b> <b>activity</b> than high. Activity submission results also showed that developers are more likely to review than correct projects, with the first priority to find and fix bugs. Further {{research is needed to determine}} the impact of <b>project</b> <b>activity</b> type on developer motivation to contribute, participate and support OS projects...|$|R
40|$|<b>Project</b> <b>activity</b> has a {{long history}} of {{implementation}} in education (Kilpatrick, 1918). This article describes the approach to <b>project</b> <b>activity</b> that became widespread in preschool education in Russia in the late 1990 s. This approach is based on the cultural-historical theory of Vygotsky (1978), Venger’s (1988) understanding of intellectual giftedness, as well as an understanding of <b>project</b> <b>activity</b> proposed by Leontiev (2000). At the heart of <b>project</b> <b>activity</b> lies children’s exploration of the space of possibilities — that is, their search for action options that correspond to their personal motives and express their individuality. The main features of <b>project</b> <b>activity</b> are the problem situation to be presented to the child; the subjectivity of all its participants, including teachers; and its nature, which includes its social context. Three main types of <b>project</b> <b>activity</b> are presented: research, creative, and normative; each has its own structure and value for children’s development. Examples of their implementation in preschool settings are provided. The impact of <b>project</b> <b>activity</b> on all its participants in preschool — children, teachers, parents — is addressed. The article shows the effectiveness of <b>project</b> <b>activity</b> for educational work with both intellectually gifted and normally developing children...|$|R
