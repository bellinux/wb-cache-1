5000|$|On April 7, 1975, {{about two}} weeks after their disappearance, a witness in Manassas, Virginia, {{reported}} seeing two girls resembling Sheila and Katherine {{in the rear of}} a beige 1968 Ford station wagon. The witness stated that the girls were bound and gagged in the vehicle. The driver of the station wagon resembled the man in the publicly available sketch of the prime suspect. The witness further claimed that when the driver spotted the witness tailing him, he ran a red light and sped west on Route 234 towards Interstate 66 in Virginia. The station wagon had Maryland license plates with the possible combination [...] "DMT-6**." [...] The last two numbers are unknown due to the bending of the car's plate. The known combination was issued in Cumberland, Hagerstown, and Baltimore, Maryland at the time. This supposed sighting inspired a small army of mobile <b>citizen</b> <b>band</b> (<b>CB)</b> radio users to scour the area throughout the evening and into the night with a running commentary and chatter but without any tangible results. A search for matching plate numbers failed to produce any information. Although this witness's report was at first treated as credible, and a media firestorm erupted because of it, it was later deemed [...] "questionable" [...] by police.

40|$|Paper Award competition. ncidents such as spills, {{accidents}} and I disablements {{are one of}} the major sources of congestion and delay on urban freeways. The negative impact of incidents on traffic flow can be mitigated by faster and more accurate incident detection, rapid and efficient response to incident location, and quicker clearance of the incident from the freeway. Incident detection has been a subject of considerable research and evolution for the past three decades. Traditionally, the means of detection have been patrols operated by the police, by the state highway department, or by contract to private groups. Roadside emergency call box and telephone systems have also been used to report incidents. Furthermore, some highway agencies have used stationary observer and television surveillance to detect incidents in strategic locations along the freeway, such as in tunnels. Other agencies have established a radio frequency dedicated to incident reporting. This system is commonly referred to as <b>citizen</b> <b>band</b> (<b>CB)</b> radio. The advent of vehicle detection systems such as loop detectors in the early 1960 s kindled interest in automating incident detection. The automation involved monitoring the freeway continuously by collecting traffic flow data through vehicle detectors spaced at intervals along the freeway. Specific incident detection algorithms then operated on the collected data to produce indicators of the probable presence of an incident. However, automatic incident detection, or highway-based incident detection, has several drawbacks. First, the cost of installing, operating and maintaining the hardware (roadway sensors, fiber-optic system, computer system and system software) is enormous, particularly for agencies with extensive freeway networks. Second, the computer detection algorithms utilized by these systems generate a considerable number of false alarms, do not detec...|$|E
