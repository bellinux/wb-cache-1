40|$|Recent, {{unprecedented}} {{increases in}} wind penetration pose new challenges to maintaining good control performance in power systems. The stochastic nature of wind power <b>creates</b> <b>an</b> incentive to <b>treat</b> control resources as stochastic. This work presents a stochastic, time-dependent model of contingency reserve (CR) activation {{that is based}} on system behavior expected by the NERC and WECC disturbance control performance standards. The model quantifies CR activation as a statistical combination of probability density functions (PDFs) that represent CR response deficiencies and generation outage probabilities. This work also formulates an algorithm for determining the CR response deficiency PDFs in real time from observed energy management system data. The proposed model has multiple applications such as a deterministic or stochastic unit commitment, system adequacy evaluation, contingency reserve margins, and contingency reserve allocation...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{looks at}} coupling desalination with {{renewable energy sources}} to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> high-value product (<b>treated</b> water) from two low value resources (brackish groundwater and intermittent solar energy). Desalination of brackish groundwater is already being considered as a potential new water supply in Texas. This research uses Texas as a testbed for spatially-resolved analysis techniques while considering depth to brackish groundwater, water quality, and solar radiation across Texas to determine the locations with the best potential for integrating solar energy with brackish groundwater desalination. The framework presented herein can be useful for policymakers, regional planners, and project developers as they consider where to site desalination facilities coupled with solar photovoltaics. Results suggest that the northwestern region of Texas—with abundant sunshine and groundwater at relatively shallow depths and low salinity in areas with freshwater scarcity—has the highest potential for solar powered desalination. The range in capacity for solar photovoltaic powered reverse osmosis desalination {{was found to be}} 1. 56 × 10 — 6 to 2. 93 ×  10 — 5 cubic meters of water per second per square meter of solar panel (m 3 /s/m 2) ...|$|R

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 114 - 118). vi, 118 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmIn November 2000, Japanese policymakers {{passed the}} 2000 Transportation Barrier-Free Law, a law designed to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> more equal society through the improved accessibility of the built environment. The 30 year path to this law was fraught with changing cultural values, demographic shifts, and domestic pressures stemming from international movements. In {{response to these}} pressures, the government realized that the urban transportation network ostensibly designed to provide mobility {{was in fact a}} major obstacle. Improving the accessibility of the transportation infrastructure was the key to <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> society that <b>treated</b> all individuals equally regardless of age or health. This thesis asks how the law arose, how private industry and the state differed in their. approach to the law, and how railway travel is changing today for persons with mobility handicaps and the aged in Tokyo. To answer these questions, this thesis reviews legal and policy changes during the two decades since the government first attempted to improve accessibility, as shown in Figure 1. The case includes a history of conflict between the interests of private industry and the interests of the government that preceded the current forms of accessibility regulation and funding in Tokyo's commuter rail system. Finally, the study ends with my own observations of the ways the 2000 Transportation Barrier-Free Law is moving Japan closer to its goals...|$|R

40|$|Tuberculosis ranks {{alongside}} HIV as {{the leading}} cause of death worldwide. This fact is complicated by drug-resistant versions of tuberculosis. Furthermore, the limited availability and high cost of stronger antibiotics <b>creates</b> <b>a</b> barrier to <b>treating</b> drug-resistant tuberculosis. In 2000, the United Nations organized to fight tuberculosis via Millennium Development Goal six and the Global Plan to Stop Tuberculosis. In an effort to understand limitations on the effectiveness of global programs, this research addresses the following question: What do physicians know about global programs for TB? Mixed methods, involving both quantitative and qualitative data, were used to obtain the results of this research. For the quantitative portion, three statistical tables were created describing 1) demographics and development; 2) tuberculosis indicators; and 3) health resources and funding. This was to provide background information on each country. Following this, five tuberculosis experts were interviewed in Japan, China, Vietnam, India, and South Africa. Interviews were condensed into core narratives and analyzed for physician knowledge about global programs for tuberculosis. Results showed evidence of disconnect between physicians and global programs. In general, physicians demonstrated dated knowledge. Three shared statistics that were removed from official documents in 2005, one cited vaguely correct information, and one did not demonstrate that they knew anything about global programs. Also, physicians described themselves as uninvolved, separate, and uninfluenced by global programs. Understanding the disconnect between physicians and global programs designed to alleviate disease burden is an area for future research...|$|R
