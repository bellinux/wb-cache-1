50|$|After {{leaving the}} U.S. House, Kennedy {{returned}} to <b>Citizens</b> <b>Energy.</b> (During Kennedy's {{terms in the}} U.S. House, it had been run by his brother Michael.) <b>Citizens</b> <b>Energy</b> pursues commercial ventures aimed at generating revenues that, in turn, are used to generate funds that could assist those in need in the U.S. and abroad. It grew to encompass seven separate companies, including {{one of the largest}} energy-conservation firms in the U.S. <b>Citizens</b> <b>Energy</b> became one of the U.S.'s first energy firms to move large volumes of natural gas to more than thirty states. As a precursor to market changes under electricity deregulation in the late 1990s, <b>Citizens</b> <b>Energy</b> was a pioneer in moving and marketing electrical power over the power grid.|$|R
40|$|The UK {{energy system}} {{has in the}} past been characterised by the {{ownership}} and control of large-scale supply technologies by corporate entities. It has become apparent however that such structures are ill suited to addressing contemporary energy challenges of decarbonisation, energy security and affordability. Moreover, their resistance to change means that the current system is fundamentally inconsistent with the need for energy system change. The advent of affordable renewable energy however, particularly at small-scale, offers new prospects for addressing these energy challenges. In particular, they present an opportunity for greater societal engagement in the energy system, not least as owners and managers of energy assets, but also as stakeholders with interest and influence in the energy system more generally. Within the context of greater <b>citizen</b> engagement in <b>energy,</b> <b>community</b> <b>energy</b> has developed in the UK as an organised means for “collective action to purchase, manage and generate energy” (DECC, 2014 b). Such collective action is complimented by progressively broad engagement by individuals in the energy system as investors and prosumers, rather than solely consumers. This thesis responds to a need to better understand the role and value of <b>community</b> <b>energy,</b> and wider societal engagement more generally, within the wider energy system. Taking a mixed-methods approach, this thesis contends that <b>community</b> <b>energy</b> has the potential to have significant impacts at both local and national scales. Social, economic and environmental impacts of a specific <b>community</b> <b>energy</b> project are evidenced to illustrate the breadth and scale of potential impacts at the local level. Broader analysis of the <b>community</b> <b>energy</b> movement, and of ‘small-scale energy’ more generally is suggestive of the potential for such approaches to be transformative in terms of overcoming system inertia. In particular, the energy system is undergoing a process of democratisation, whereby power, wealth and value is gradually distributed among society. A key role for policymakers then is to consider the strategic importance of democratisation. ...|$|R

50|$|After its {{entry into}} force, Ukraine held an Observer status for the Treaty {{establishing}} the <b>Energy</b> <b>Community</b> (also referred as European <b>Energy</b> <b>Community),</b> a community established between the European Union (EU) {{and a number}} of third countries in order to extend the EU internal energy market to South East Europe and beyond. The Treaty establishing the <b>Energy</b> <b>Community</b> was signed in Athens, Greece, on 25 October 2005, and entered into force on 1 July 2006. Ukraine soon expressed its interest in full membership. Mandated by the <b>Energy</b> <b>Community</b> Ministerial Council, the European Commission had the first round of formal negotiations with Ukraine in late 2008. After three negotiation rounds, the technical negotiations with Ukraine were concluded in 2009. The Ministerial Council, however, made the membership conditional on legislative amendments. In concrete, it requested Ukraine to revise its gas law so that it complies with EU's Gas Directive 2003/55/EC. Following the amendment of the gas law in July 2010, Ukraine signed the <b>Energy</b> <b>Community</b> Accession Protocol on 24 September 2010, ratified the Treaty on 15 December 2010 and officially acceded the <b>Energy</b> <b>Community</b> on 1 February 2011.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{findings from}} initial fieldwork studies of sustainable <b>energy</b> <b>community</b> development methodologies in two islands in Denmark and one rural village in Ireland. The main goals {{of this study}} were to determine the enablers and barriers to their successful development and to assess the successful elements of these previously implemented sustainable <b>energy</b> <b>community</b> development methodologies. The study involved extensive semi-structured interviews with the managers of the sustainable <b>energy</b> <b>community</b> projects and comprehensive site visits of each project. The evidence presented in this paper indicates that social barriers are interconnected and often reinforce each other. This article suggests that a comprehensive understanding of how barriers can be transformed into enablers supports the successful development of sustainable <b>energy</b> <b>communities</b> at local level in Europe. The findings in this research indicate that although each of the sustainable <b>energy</b> <b>communities</b> studied did not have any specific implementation framework developed for their projects, many of the successful tools and methodologies used across all communities were similar. The significant contribution of this work is the illumination of key factors influencing the successful development of sustainable <b>energy</b> <b>communities</b> in Ireland and Europe...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a control architecture and utility maximization mechanisms for a smart grid based <b>energy</b> <b>community.</b> The particular focus is upon a central server based, utility-oriented <b>energy</b> <b>community</b> which {{is composed of}} producer-consumer (prosumer) households each having a home gateway, an energy management system, smart meters, production units and appliances. To find out how such an <b>energy</b> <b>community</b> could be optimally managed from a central server, the type of intelligence required for the different nodes in the energy network has been identified. In addition, different control mechanisms that enable the <b>energy</b> <b>community</b> to make an optimal use of its energy resources are explored. Moreover, utility maximization mechanisms have been implemented on the aggregate energy profile of the <b>energy</b> <b>community</b> targeting three main objectives namely maximizing the aggregate greenness, minimizing the aggregate energy cost and maximizing the prosumers’ comfort. Maximizing the aggregate greenness aims to maximize the level of consumption of renewable energy resources using a novel mechanism that reduces {{the difference between the}} supply of and demand for renewable energy resources. Minimizing the aggregate energy cost aims to reduce the peak to average ratio of the aggregate energy profile of the <b>energy</b> <b>community</b> using direct mechanisms for energy cost minimization and a novel appliance based pricing scheme. Maximizing the prosumers’ comfort aims to preserve the schedule preference of prosumers. The mechanisms above are designed and implemented under a research setting of a renewable energy company that manages an <b>energy</b> <b>community</b> composed of central servers which control household, building and/or industrial prosumers.

However, the demand across the region for a sustainable, competitive and stable energy sector creates an ‘energy incentive’ that the Union can leverage to improve the rule of law and adherence to European rules. Furthermore, a juridical strengthening of the <b>Energy</b> <b>Community</b> Treaty will also strengthen the hand of those parties supporting energy liberalisation rules across the region, such as independent businesses, consumers and NGOs. In addition, there is likely to be significant spill-over effects from decisions of a European <b>Energy</b> <b>Community</b> Court operating in the region on the rule of law in general and the accession process in particular...|$|R
