Effects of low {{frequency}} electromagnetic field on surface quality, microstructure and hot-tearing tendency of {{direct chill casting}} of Φ 500 mm ZK 60 magnesium alloy billets were investigated.

In the conventional direct chill casting, the microstructures of the billet, especially at the center, are coarse. The distribution of the grain size is non-uniform throughout the billet. From the edge to the center, the microstructure gradually changes from fine to coarse in all billets. However, under the low frequency electromagnetic casting, the microstructures of the billet is significantly refined, the distribution of the grains size is relatively uniform from the billets edge to the billets center. And it also shows that the hot-tearing tendency of direct chill casting Φ 500 mm ZK 60 magnesium alloy billets under low frequency electromagnetic field is significantly reduced...|$|E
40|$|We {{explain the}} {{physical}} {{basis of a}} model for small globular proteins with water interactions. The water is supposed to access the protein interior in an "all-or-none" manner during the unfolding of the protein chain. As a consequence of this mechanism (somewhat speculative), the model exhibits fundamental aspects of protein thermodynamics, as cold, and warm unfolding of the polypeptide chain, and hence decreasing the temperature below the cold unfolding the protein folds again, accordingly the heat capacity has three characteristic peaks. The cold and warm unfolding has a sharpness close to a two-state system, while the <b>cold</b> <b>folding</b> is a transition where the intermediate states in the folding is energetical close to the folded/unfolded states, yielding a less sharp transition. The entropy of the protein chain causes both the <b>cold</b> <b>folding</b> and the warm unfolding. Comment: 13 pages LaTeX, 4 Postscript figure...|$|R

40|$|Off-pathway intermolecular {{interactions}} between partially folded polypeptide chains often compete with correct intramolecular interactions, resulting in self-association of folding intermediates into the inclusion body state. Intermediates for both productive folding and off-pathway aggregation of the parallel beta-coil tailspike trimer of phage P 22 {{have been identified}} in vivo and in vitro using native gel electrophoresis in the <b>cold.</b> Aggregation of <b>folding</b> intermediates was suppressed when refolding was initiated and allowed to proceed for a short period at 0 degrees C prior to warming to 20 degrees C. Yields of refolded tailspike trimers exceeding 80 % were obtained using this temperature-shift procedure, first described by Xie and Wetlaufer (1996, Protein Sci 5 : 517 - 523). We interpret this as due to stabilization of the thermolabile monomeric intermediate at the junction between productive folding and off-pathway aggregation. Partially folded monomers, a newly identified dimer, and the protrimer folding intermediates were populated in the cold. These species were electrophoretically distinguished from the multimeric intermediates populated on the aggregation pathway. The productive protrimer intermediate is disulfide bonded (Robinson AS, King J, 1997, Nat Struct Biol 4 : 450 - 455), while the multimeric aggregation intermediates are not disulfide bonded. The partially folded dimer appears to be a precursor to the disulfide-bonded protrimer. The results support a model in which the junctional partially folded monomeric intermediate acquires resistance to aggregation in the <b>cold</b> by <b>folding</b> further to a conformation that is activated for correct recognition and subunit assembly...|$|R

40|$|Upon {{biological}} self-assembly, {{the number}} of accessible translational configurations {{of water in the}} system increases considerably, leading to a large gain in water entropy. It is important to calculate the solvation entropy of a biomolecule with a prescribed structure by accounting for the change in water–water correlations caused by solute insertion. Modeling water as a dielectric continuum is not capable of capturing the physical essence of the water entropy effect. As a reliable tool, we propose a hybrid of the angle-dependent integral equation theory combined with a multipolar water model and a morphometric approach. Using our methods wherein the water entropy effect is treated as the key factor, we can elucidate a variety of processes such as protein <b>folding,</b> <b>cold,</b> pressure, and heat denaturating of a protein, molecular recognition, ordered association of proteins such as amyloid fibril formation, and functioning of ATP-driven proteins...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Shape memory alloys (SMAs) {{constitute}} a unique class of materials that undergo a reversible phase transformation allowing {{the material to}} display dramatic stress-induced and temperature-induced deformations which are recoverable. Nickel Titanium (NiTi) SMA has be synthesized with refined grain size by a mechanical alloying process. The SMA is produced through a cold rolling fabrication strategy that yields nanocrystalline product structures. By starting with a stacked sandwich array of individual alloy components and subjecting this sample arrangement to repeated rolling and folding, a metal-metal multilayer composite is created. After the layer thickness is reduced to the nanoscale by multiple <b>cold</b> rolling and <b>folding</b> passes, an alloying and intermediate phase formation reaction is initiated. X-ray diffraction profiles confirm that the primary phase present is intermetallic NiTi phase, which is the phase that displays shape memory behavior. The presence of superelastic behavior and the shape memory effect in the product material is established by mechanical testing. At this refined grain size, the hysteresis stress observed is exceptionally small...|$|R

Cold Steel marketed knives made {{for them in the}} U.S. by Camillus using a carbon steel given the trademarked name [...] "Carbon V", read Carbon five. Their imported knives were nearly all made in Seki Japan using Aus8 which Cold Steel labelled [...] "400 Series Stainless". They also had two models made in Taiwan, both of which switched to Japan in 2000. In 2007 Camillus New York went bankrupt and Cold Steel was forced to find a new manufacturer for their carbon steel fixed blades. Cold steel first went to China (People's Republic of China) but allegedly due to quality issues they switched to Taiwan (Republic of China) production. At the same time Cold Steel moved all of their folding knife manufacturing from Seki Japan to Taiwan. The carbon steel was SK5 and stainless was Aus8 both imported to Taiwan from Japan. However the Sanmai III models remained strictly Seki Japan production. [...] Today the knives made in Japan use VG-1 Stainless Steel and VG1 core Sanmai III, the Taiwan models use German 4116 stainless steel, D2 steel, 1055 high carbon steel, O-1 high carbon, SK-5 high carbon steel, Japanese AUS 8A stainless steel and American CPM 3V tool steel. The largest Sanmai III fixed blades are made by Hattori. <b>Cold</b> Steel's <b>folding</b> knives are renowned for their lock strength, due primarily to the introduction of the TRI-AD locking mechanism, designed by custom knife maker Andrew Demko.|$|R
50|$|Some {{scholars}} {{state that}} the fustanella was derived {{from a series of}} ancient Greek garments such as the chiton (or tunic) and the chitonium (or short military tunic). Although the pleated skirt has been linked to an ancient statue (3rd century BC) located in the area around the Acropolis in Athens, there is no surviving ancient Greek clothing that can confirm this connection. However, a 5th-century BC relief statue was discovered in Vari Cave, Attica, by Charles Heald Weller of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens depicting a stonecutter, Archedemus the Nympholept, wearing a fustanella-like garment. The Roman toga may have also influenced the evolution of the fustanella based on statues of Roman emperors wearing knee-length pleated skirts (in <b>colder</b> regions, more <b>folds</b> were added to provide greater warmth). Folklorist Ioanna Papantoniou considers the Celtic kilt, as viewed by the Roman legions, to have served as a prototype. Sir Arthur Evans considered the fustanella of the female peasants (worn over and above the Slavonic apron) living near the modern Bosnian-Montenegrin borders as a preserved Illyrian element among the local Slavic-speaking populations.|$|R
40|$|Paper {{has been}} an {{essential}} material in our daily life since ancient times. Its affordability, accessibility, adaptability, workability and its easiness of usage makes it an attractive structural material to develop many kind of technologies such as flexible electronics, energy storage and harvesting devices. Additionally, the scientific community has increased its interest on waste heat as an environmentally friendly energy source to support the increasing energy demand. Therefore, {{in this paper we}} described two affordable and flexible thermoelectric nanogenerators (TEGs) developed on paper substrates by the usage of simple micromachining and microfabrication techniques. Moreover, they exhibit mechanical stability and adaptability (through folding and cutting techniques) for a diverse set of scenarios where vertical or horizontal schemes can be conveniently used depending on the final application. The first TEG device, implemented on standard paper, generated a power of 0. 5 nW (ΔT = 50 K). By changing the substrate to a tearless and extra-smooth polyester paper, the TEG performance was optimized achieving less internal resistance and a greater power of ~ 80 nW (ΔT = 75 K), at the cost of more rigidity in the substrate. This power represented over three times higher power production than the standard paper–based TEG with same dimensions, number of thermoelectric pairs and temperature difference. Another interesting aspect of paper based TEG is due to its foldability, one can control the temperature difference by unfolding (larger separation between hot and <b>cold</b> ends) and <b>folding</b> (smaller separation). Finally, one of the underlying objectives of this work is to spread the availability of essential technologies to the broad population by inclusion of everyday materials and simple processes...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the process}} leading a {{polypeptide}} chain to its native state {{is one of}} the unsolved problems of modern Biochemistry. Even if the sequence of a protein contains all the information necessary to guide the folding process, it has been demonstrated that the residual structure eventually present in the denatured state can tune the folding process. For this reason, studying the characteristics of the denatured state has become an useful tool to understand better the folding process. In this work the attention has been focused on yeast frataxin, a mitochondrial protein orthologous of human frataxin, which is involved in several processes required for the cellular regulation of iron homeostasis. Yeast frataxin is an interesting system because it undergoes cold denaturation at physiological conditions and at temperature above the freezing point of water. Therefore, it gives the chance to study the folding process taking into account both the cold and hot denatured states. The first part of this thesis is thus focused on the characterization of the hot and cold denaturation processes. Analysis of thermal denaturation experiments and kinetic experiments revealed a simple two state folding process. Then the transition states of the reaction have been characterized by using a Φ-value analysis at two different temperatures, in combination with molecular dynamics simulations. The differences in the <b>cold</b> and hot <b>folding</b> processes have been established by comparing the structure of the denatured states with the one of the transition states. The second part is focused instead on the characterization of another interesting aspect of yeast frataxin: the competition between folding and function and its consequences for misfolding and aggregation. Kinetic experiments have been performed on yeast frataxin by using urea as a chaotropic agent. By analyzing the chevron plots obtained under different pH conditions, it has been established that frataxin folds via a broad free energy barrier. This feature has been associated with protein frustration and it gives the possibility to analyze both the early and late events of folding. In order to do that, a Φ-value analysis has been performed and the data obtained have been used in molecular dynamics simulations. In this way it has been demonstrated that at the early stage of folding a significative fraction of nonnative contacts can be observed. The prediction of molecular dynamics simulation has been confirmed by a second round of mutagenesis, mutating those residues that are supposed to result in non canonical Φ-values, confirming a high level of frustration in such regions and a propensity of frataxin to misfold at the early stage of the folding process...|$|R
