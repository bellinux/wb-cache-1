5|$|The Tang dynasty {{government}} {{attempted to}} create an accurate <b>census</b> <b>of</b> {{the size of their}} empire's population, mostly for effective taxation and matters of military conscription for each region. The early Tang government established both the grain tax and cloth tax at a relatively low rate for each household under the empire. This was meant to encourage households to enroll for taxation and not avoid the authorities, thus providing the government with the most accurate estimate possible. In the <b>census</b> <b>of</b> 609, the population was tallied by efforts of the government at a size of 9 million households, or about 50million people. The Tang <b>census</b> <b>of</b> 742 again approximated the size of China's population at about 50million people. Patricia Ebrey writes that even if a rather significant number of people had avoided the registration process of the tax census, the population size during the Tang had not grown significantly since the earlier Han dynasty (the <b>census</b> <b>of</b> the year 2 recording a population of roughly 58 million people in China). S.A.M. Adshead disagrees, estimating that there were about 75 million people by 750.|$|E
