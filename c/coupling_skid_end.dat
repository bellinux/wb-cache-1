50|$|The Condor's oval section {{fuselage}} {{was built}} around three longerons, {{two in the}} upper part and one, in the keel, which extended rearwards {{only as far as}} the rubber sprung landing <b>skid,</b> <b>ending</b> under the trailing edge. It was covered in stressed birch plywood. The forward fuselage was deep, with the wing on top and the single-seat cockpit ahead of the leading edge under a removable wooden cover with broad framed windows, limiting the pilot's view. Behind the wing the fuselage was slimmer and tapered to the tail, where a very small triangular fin carried a balanced rudder with an upright leading edge but which was full and rounded aft. The narrow tailplane, mounted forward of the rudder, carried balanced elevators.|$|R

2500|$|Looking {{to rebound}} from their 12-game losing streak in May, the Royals started {{the month of}} June with 4 {{consecutive}} series wins over National League opponents. Kansas City completed its first ever series sweep of the Cardinals in St. Louis. In 12 years of Interleague play, the Cardinals still hold the I-70 Series lead, 26-22, but the Royals have done better in St. Louis, winning 11 of 21 games. On June 22, the Royals made an improbable comeback after trailing 6-0 and later 10-3 against the San Francisco Giants. The Royals scored 8 unanswered runs and won the game and Joakim Soria recorded his 20th save {{of the season in}} 21 tries. Following a sweep of the defending National League champion Colorado Rockies, the Royals boasted an MLB-best 123 record in Interleague play and won for the tenth time in 11 games. Following their 12-game <b>skid</b> <b>ended</b> in May, the Royals went 159, closed to within seven games of [...]500 and skipped out of last place of the American League Central.|$|R
5000|$|On April 19, 2008 a Cessna Citation Mustang <b>skidded</b> off the <b>end</b> of runway 24 and {{collapsed}} the main landing gear. The aircraft had four on board, who were uninjured. The Mustang had flown from Lincoln Regional Airport, northeast of Sacramento, California.|$|R
50|$|Two {{different}} fuselages {{were built}} for the Alciones. Both had the same general form, deep under the cockpit which was placed forward of the wing leading edge under an enclosing canopy. There was a short landing <b>skid,</b> <b>ending</b> aft at a semi-recessed wheel at about mid chord. However, one fuselage type had a hexagonal cross-section {{and the other was}} better shaped aerodynamically as an ovoid. The latter was lower along the dorsal line, so the other's glazed cockpit cover was lengthened aft with a ply covered extension including small side windows. The lower line also required the addition of a very short pedestal for the tailplane, directly mounted onto the hexagonal fuselage. The horizontal tail was straight tapered and round tipped, placed with its trailing edge in line with that of a narrow fin so that no cut-out for rudder movement was needed. On the ovoid fuselage version with its small pedestal the fin reached only about halfway {{to the top of the}} rudder, allowing the inclusion of an aerodynamic balance. On the other fuselage the fin continued upwards to the rudder tip. The rudder itself was broad and D-shaped. There was a little tail bumper on the fuselage keel at the rudder's foot.|$|R

50|$|The Pellicano had an oval cross-section, ply skinned {{monocoque}} fuselage tapering rearwards. The narrow chord fixed rear surfaces were ply {{covered with}} the tailplane mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage and forward of the fin. The control surfaces were fabric covered and the rudder, broad and deep, moved in a gap between the elevators. The pilot sat ahead of {{the leading edge of the}} wing under a multi-piece canopy with a rather upright windscreen and which merged into the upper fuselage aft. There was no landing wheel, just a <b>skid</b> which <b>ended</b> under the wings and a very small tail skid.|$|R

25|$|Starting off {{the month}} of November, the Predators killed all four of Colorado's power play {{opportunities}} and scored five goals, two from Craig Smith, to beat the Avalanche 5–1 and end a three-game losing <b>skid.</b> The Predators <b>ended</b> their five-game road trip in Glendale, Arizona, with a 3–2 shootout loss to the Coyotes. Back home in Nashville on November 5, the Predators and the Hurricanes played through an even matchup, with goals from James Neal and Matt Irwin, that went to a shootout where Jaccob Slavin made the winning goal past Rinne and the Hurricanes beat the Predators 3–2.|$|R
25|$|The plane <b>skidded</b> off the <b>end</b> of the runway, {{crashed into}} the fence {{surrounding}} the airport and across a road before its port wing was torn off as it caught a house, home to a family of six. The father and eldest daughter were away and {{the mother and the}} other three children escaped as the house caught fire. Part of the plane's tail was torn off before {{the left side of the}} cockpit hit a tree. The right side of the fuselage hit a wooden hut, inside which was a truck filled with tyres and fuel, which exploded. Twenty passengers died on board, and three died later in hospital.|$|R
50|$|Unpowered {{flight tests}} {{revealed}} poor stability and dangerous landing characteristics with 5-1,(first prototype), being {{damaged beyond repair}} after the third gliding flight. Flight tests with Aircraft 5-2, fitted with a 45 degree swept fin of greater aspect ratio to improve directional stability, resumed on 26 January 1949, but further delays were caused by the pilot landing off the runway causing serious damage. To improve the landing stability 5-2 was modified with wing-tip <b>skids,</b> at the <b>end</b> of downturned wing-tips with 45 degrees anhedral, and a single skid on the centreline, {{as well as a}} ventral fin at the rear. Flying and landing qualities were much improved, but progress was slow and the Bisnovat 5 was cancelled without the aircraft making a single powered flight and only sixteen gliding flights, between 14 July 1948 and November 1949, during which a maximum speed of 0.775M was attained.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Šohaj {{is completely}} ply skinned, tapering to the tail. The single seat cockpit, placed {{just ahead of}} the wing leading has a side opening, single piece, blown perspex canopy. On the first two variants this was short, with an abrupt forward profile but on the Šohaj 3 it was lengthened to the nose, with a much smoother contour. At the rear these canopies merge into the fuselage forward of and over the wing. The fixed tail surfaces have straight leading edges and are ply covered, with rounded, fabric covered control surfaces. The tailplane is mounted just above the fuselage, sufficiently far forward for the elevators to be ahead of the deep rudder, which is protected by a tail bumper. There is an elevator trim tab to adjust for different pilot weights The Šohaj 1 lands on a simple, rubber sprung skid but the later models have a fixed, semi-recessed monowheel just behind the <b>skid</b> which now <b>ends</b> under mid-wing.|$|R
50|$|As {{the field}} {{came down the}} mainstretch for the start, Palmer pulled into the pits and {{accelerated}} down the pit lane. Palmer continued to accelerate, under the impression he was required to cross the start/finish line in the pit area prior to the race cars doing so out on the track. His reference flag (or cone) had been removed and he missed his planned braking spot. Moving upwards of perhaps 125 mph, Palmer realized he was going too fast, and rather than perilously veering back on to the racing surface, {{he stood on the}} brakes (the car was equipped with drum brakes) and lost control. The car swerved and <b>skidded</b> to the <b>end</b> of the pit lane, and crashed into a photographers' stand. The stand collapsed, injuring 29 people, however, no people were killed. Dr. Vicente Alvarez, a freelance photographer from Argentina, was one of two on the stand who were seriously injured. Alvarez survived, and died in the late 1990s. Tony Hulman suffered a sprained ankle, and a shaken Schenkel sat out the remainder of the ABC broadcast.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the loss}} of Williams, 2008-09 was the most {{successful}} year in Baucom's tenure. In {{the first game of}} the season, the Keydets upset the Kentucky Wildcats in Rupp Arena, 111-103. Led by senior twins Chavis and Travis Holmes, the new system was starting to pay dividends, and after a 4-2 start following a 28-point loss at Jacksonville State, VMI reeled off ten straight wins to go 14-2 and 6-0 in league play. The streak was broken at home by Liberty in the first and currently only sellout in Cameron Hall history with 5,029 fans in attendance. After defeating Charleston Southern to move to 20-3 and 11-2 in the conference, VMI <b>skidded</b> towards the <b>end</b> of the year with three straight losses, two of which were against weaker opponents. They managed to regroup, ending the season with two wins and advancing to another Big South tournament appearance. However, they were denied their first bid to the NCAA tournament since 1977 again, falling to Radford, 108-94, ending a 24-8 season. The 24 victories were the most since that 1977 campaign, and it was only the fourth twenty-win season in program history.|$|R
40|$|The skid {{resistance}} performance of surface aggregates {{can be assessed}} in the laboratory by using a polishing device {{that is designed to}} simulate traffic polishing actions <b>coupled</b> with a <b>skid</b> resistance measuring device. The standard laboratory test has historically been the Polished Stone Value (PSV) test as specified in BS EN 1097 - 8 : 2009. However, as the technology has advanced and traffic volume and composition on our roads have changed, other devices and methodologies have been developed in an attempt to better assess the {{skid resistance}} performance of surface aggregates. This paper discusses the usage of two alternative laboratory tests, the Auckland Pavement Polishing Device (APPD) and the Wehner/Schulze (WS) devices, to assess the skid resistance performance of three different New Zealand Greywacke aggregates. The paper discusses the variations in APPD and its corresponding skid resistance measuring device, the Dynamic Friction Tester (DFT) and the effect of macrotexture in the APPD-DFT test. The results show that there is a good relationship between the APPD-DFT and the PSV tests, while there is no relationship between the WS and the PSV tests. However, the APPD and the WS tests correlate very well. There are only three Greywacke aggregates used in this research, and hence, no conclusive results can be drawn on the relationship between these laboratory tests as yet...|$|R

5000|$|Sometimes {{referred}} to as the [...] "ugliest" [...] dirigibles ever made, production Coastals looked very similar, but used a bespoke gondola with canvas sides built over a wooden frame. The trilobe envelope allowed the gondola to be hung closer to the envelope, reducing the overall height of the aircraft and slightly reducing head resistance. Four ballonets, two in each of the two lower lobes, were used to maintain the envelope's shape and pressure. These were kept inflated by a metal air scoop mounted in the slipstream of the forward propeller on earlier examples, and at the rear propeller on later versions. The nose of the envelope was made of aluminium sheet reinforced with bamboo canes to prevent it deforming due to the airflow pressure as the airship moved. Three tailfins were used. The two upper ones were mounted in a shallow V-tail configuration and carried the elevators, while the single vertical fin below the envelope incorporated a rudder. Ten main suspensions were incorporated in the Coastal envelope, of which seven supported the weight of the gondola, and the remaining three took the guys that allowed the 196 ft (60 m)-long airships to be handled on the ground. No landing gear was fitted, apart from two wooden <b>skids</b> at either <b>end</b> of the gondola which also protected the propellers.|$|R
50|$|Eager {{to avoid}} such a {{scenario}} again, the club's management chartered a plane for the quarter-final second leg away to Red Star Belgrade. Following a 2-1 win in the first leg at Old Trafford, a 3-3 draw in Belgrade was enough to secure passage to the semi-finals. On the return flight to Manchester, British European Airways Flight 609 stopped over in a snow-covered Munich for refuelling. Once the refuelling was complete, the pilot was given clearance to take off, only to be halted by a fault with the plane's engine. A second attempt was made a few seconds later, but the same fault kept the plane grounded. Half an hour later, after inspection by the airport's engineers, the plane was given clearance for another take-off attempt. The suggested solution {{was to have the}} plane accelerate more slowly, but this meant that the take-off velocity would not be reached until the plane was even further down the runway. Once the plane reached 117 knots - the speed at which it was no longer safe to abort the take-off - the pilot would have expected the plane's velocity to continue to increase; however, there was a sudden drop in velocity and the plane was unable to take off {{before the end of the}} runway. It <b>skidded</b> off the <b>end</b> of the runway, through a wire fence and across a road before crashing into a house.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. A., History (Public History)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2013. Following World War Two, federal {{legislation}} allowed leaders in American cities to implement aggressive programs of urban renewal. Designed to revitalize neighborhoods blighted by decades of neglect, such programs often razed a city???s oldest and poorest neighborhoods, {{replacing them with}} newly built residential and commercial districts. Sacramento???s period of urban renewal began in earnest in the 1950 s, when city planners and redevelopment officials formulated plans to redevelop the city???s West End area. Within the West End was the Sacramento???s skid row area, an economically depressed district of inexpensive hotels that was historically home to thousands of single, male, transient agricultural workers. Although skid row {{had a reputation for}} moral and social decay, city leaders recognized its value as a source of cheap labor for area farms. Nonetheless, the area was to be demolished and redeveloped. Through the 1950 s, the Sacramento Redevelopment Agency formulated a series of proposals for the relocation the city???s skid row population to a new skid row neighborhood that was to be built on the model of the old one. The redevelopment agency abandoned its plan in 1959 and never instituted a new plan to relocate skid row residents displaced by redevelopment in the 1950 s and 1960 s. In the <b>end,</b> the displaced <b>skid</b> row population gradually relocated independently to other impoverished areas in Sacramento and elsewhere. West End Boys explains and contextualizes the reasoning behind planners??? proposals for a new skid row neighborhood and tracks the effects the failure to implement those proposals had on Sacramento???s skid row population. Historical and sociological secondary sources provide the foundation for this analysis. Another valuable body of source material is the collection of studies and plans issued by the Sacramento Redevelopment Agency, the Sacramento City Planning Commission, and other local agencies. In addition, press accounts from the era provide insight into the events surrounding the demolition of Sacramento???s <b>skid</b> row. West <b>End</b> Boys uses these sources to illuminate a topic left largely unexamined by historians. Histor...|$|R
