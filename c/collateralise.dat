This paper analyses how changes in transaction costs may affect the value of assets that banks use to <b>collateralise</b> borrowings in monetary policy operations. Based on a simple asset pricing model and employing a dataset of hypothetical Eurosystem collateral positions, we simulate and quantify the resulting change in collateral value pledged by counterparties to the Eurosystem, resulting from a transaction cost shock. A 10 basis point increase in transaction costs entails a direct - 0. 30 % decrease of collateral value and a - 0. 07 % decrease when adjusted for the expected {{reduction in the number}} of trades of each asset. We conclude that banks will on average suffer small collateral losses while selected institutions could face a considerably larger collateral decrease...|$|E

40|$|Debt {{with many}} {{creditors}} is analysed in a continuous-time pricing {{model of the}} levered firm. We specifically allow for debtor opportunism vis-à-vis a non-co-ordinated group of creditors, in form of repeated strategic renegotiation offers and default threats. We show that the creditors initial entitlement to non-collateralized assets will be expropriated through exchange offers. Exchange offers successively increase the level of collateral until all assets are fully <b>collateralised.</b> The ex ante optimal debt contract is neither fully <b>collateralised</b> nor without any collateral. Diffusely held debt allows for a larger debt capacity and bears lower credit risk premia than privately held debt.

Central banks are susceptible to losses resulting from double default events where a reverse repo counterparty and the collateral default simultaneously. While there is a broad range of theoretical models for assessing and quantifying portfolio credit risk and double default, this paper aims to propose a practical framework that uses a portfolio of notional CDS contracts with dummy counterparties to represent collateral for loan exposures. A key advantage of this approach is that it can be implemented within CreditManager – a widely used risk IT application. Extensions to enable modelling of additional heterogeneous pools of collateral and to account for the effect of overcollateralisation are also outlined. The preliminary results indicate that applying this framework generates loss distributions that reflect the inherent credit risks associated with <b>collateralised</b> lending...|$|R
40|$|Market {{interest}} rates on sovereign debt issued by the 12 Eurozone national governments differ very little from each other, despite the credit ratings of these governments ranging from triple A to single A, and despite significant differences among their objective indicators of fiscal-financial sustainability. We argue that this market failure is {{at least in part}} due to a policy failure: the operational practices of the European Central Bank {{and the rest of the}} Eurosystem in its <b>collateralised</b> open market operations convey the message that the Eurosystem views the debt of the 12 Eurozone sovereigns as equivalent. The euro-denominated debt instruments of all twelve Eurozone governments are deemed to be eligible for use as collateral in <b>collateralised</b> lending by the Eurosystem. They are in addition allocated to the same (highest) liquidity category (Tier One, Category 1) as the debt instruments of the Eurosystem itself and subject to the lowest 'valuation haircut' (discount on the market value). Haircuts also increase with the remaining time to maturity. This discourages the use as collateral of longer maturity debt which would be more likely to reveal differences in sovereign default risk. We propose that the size of the haircut on each debt instrument be related inversely to its credit rating. A further re-enforcement of the market’s ability to penalise and constrain unsustainable budgetary policies would be to declare the sovereign debt of nations that violate the conditions of the Stability and Growth Pact to be ineligible as collateral in Eurosystem Repos. <b>collateralised</b> loans; Eurosystem; sovereign default risk...|$|R

40|$|Reverse {{mortgage}} (RM) {{products are}} growing increasingly popular in many developed countries. This article designs a tranching security {{to deal with}} longevity and house price risks for RM products. The securitisation structure for RM products, the <b>collateralised</b> reverse mortgage obligation (CRMO), {{is similar to that}} for the <b>collateralised</b> debt obligation (CDO). However, unlike the CDO, the CRMO takes into account the dynamics of future mortality rates and house price returns instead of the default rate. To capture longevity risk for RM borrowers, this study employs the CBD model to project future mortality rates, as well as compares these results with those from the Lee-Carter model and static mortality table. The house price return dynamics is modelled using an ARMA-GARCH process. The calculation of fair spreads of CRMO in different tranches is illustrated under the risk-neutral valuation framework. On the basis of mortality experience and the programme of Home Equity Conversion Mortgage in the United States, this research demonstrates the problems of using static mortality tables and models risk for pricing fair spreads for CRMO numerically. ...|$|R

40|$|Rating <b>collateralised</b> debt {{obligations}} (CDOs), {{which are}} based on tranched pools of credit risk exposures, does not only require attributing a probability of default to each obligor within the portfolio. It also involves assumptions concerning recovery rates and correlated defaults of pool assets, thus combining credit risk assessments of individual collateral assets with estimates about default correlations and other modelling assumptions. In this paper, we explain one of the most well-known models for rating CDOs, the so-called binomial expansion technique (BET). Comparing this approach with an alternative methodology based on Monte Carlo simulation, we then highlight the potential importance of correlation assumptions for the ratings of senior CDO tranches and explore what differences in methodologies across rating agencies may mean for senior tranche rating outcomes. The remainder of the paper talks about potential implications of certain model assumptions for ratings accuracy, that is the "model risk" taken by investors when acquiring CDO tranches, and whether and under what conditions methodological differences may generate incentives for issuers to strategically select rating agencies to get particular CDO structures rated. <b>Collateralised</b> debt obligations, credit risk modelling, rating agencies...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the impact of {{structure}} of dependency on the pricing of multi-name credit derivatives such as <b>collateralised</b> debt obligations (CDO). The correlation between names defaulting has an effect on the value of the basket credit derivatives. We present a copula based simulation procedure for pricing CDO under different structure of dependency and assessing the influence of different price drivers (correlation, hazard rates and recovery rates) on modelling portfolio losses. Gaussian copulas and Monte Carlo simulation are widely used to measure the default risk in basket credit derivatives. Many studies have shown that many distributions have fatter tails than those captured by the normal distribution. We use distributions with fat tails such as the t-student distribution.
