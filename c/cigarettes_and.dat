5|$|American Idiot is {{the seventh}} studio album by American rock band Green Day. Produced by Rob Cavallo, {{the album was}} {{released}} in the UK on September 20, 2004 and in the US on September 21, 2004 by Reprise Records. Green Day first achieved popularity in the 1990s {{with a string of}} successful albums. Following disappointing sales of their sixth album, Warning (2000), the band took a break before recording their next album, titled <b>Cigarettes</b> <b>and</b> Valentines. The recording process was cut short when the album's master tapes were stolen. Rather than re-record that material, the group decided to start over.|$|E
5|$|Another seven internees were {{executed}} by the Japanese authorities. These internees had possessed a radio set which they used to pass messages {{in and out of}} camp. The radio was discovered by the Japanese and the internees were arrested. The other internees were forced to watch their public torture. Military trials were subsequently held and on 29 October 1943, some of the internees {{were executed}} by being shot and at least one, John Fraser, was beheaded. Aside from this, the Japanese authorities had executed by decapitation, three Chinese policemen for bringing <b>cigarettes</b> <b>and</b> tobacco to the camp's internees.|$|E

5|$|During the General Assembly's 2005 session, Fletcher again {{proposed}} his {{tax reform}} plan, and {{late in the}} session, both houses passed it. The plan raised sin taxes on <b>cigarettes</b> <b>and</b> alcohol, as well as upping taxes on satellite television service and motel rooms. Businesses were also subjected to a gross receipts tax. In exchange, corporate taxes were lowered, as were income taxes for individuals who earned less than $75,000 annually; 300,000 low-wage earners were dropped from the income tax rolls altogether. The Assembly also passed a budget {{for the remainder of}} the biennium, abolished the state's public campaign finance laws, and passed new school nutrition guidelines.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though most}} {{consumer}} items {{are in short}} supply in North Korea, there is a considerable variety of cigarettes available. In general, strong tobacco is preferred, and filters are rare. Western brands, particularly American, but also Chinese, Russian and Japanese are popular with the elite and preferred over domestic cigarettes. Foreign <b>cigarettes</b> <b>and</b> the domestic 727 brand, whose name stands for 27 July, the date of the Korean Armistice Agreement, are veritable status symbols. Menthol cigarettes are virtually non-existent, but there is competition among tobacco companies to introduce other attractive products, such as fruit-flavoured balls inside the filter to give the cigarette flavour.|$|E

5|$|Often, Underwood's {{thoughts}} {{throughout the}} series {{are presented in}} a direct address to the audience, a narrative technique known as breaking the fourth wall. Immediately prior to starring in House of Cards, Spacey had starred in a production of William Shakespeare's Richard III as Richard III of England, a character {{that serves as a}} partial basis for both Urquhart and Underwood. His last name is derived from Oscar Underwood, who served as the first Democratic House Minority Whip from about 1900 to 1901. His few vices include smoking <b>cigarettes</b> <b>and</b> playing video games; when the Secret Service cuts off his online gaming service after he becomes Vice President, he takes up creating model figurines.|$|E

40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} an attempt to explore the {{structural}} relationship between religious activity, religious struggle, attitude to drugs, social modeling, spiritual well-being, <b>and</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> tobacco smoking among students. Method: For this purpose, 504 male and female students from Kharazmi University, Agricultural Paradise, and Azad University of Karaj were selected by cluster sampling and they were asked to complete spiritual well-being scale, religious activity scale, religious struggle scale, social modeling scale, negative beliefs about drugs, and the tobacco section of the high-risk behavior questionnaire. Results: The results showed that the effect of religious activity on <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> tobacco smoking was mediated by negative beliefs about drugs, social modeling, spiritual well-being, and incentives for drug use. Similarly, the effect of religious struggle on <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> tobacco smoking was mediated by spiritual well-being. Conclusion: It seems that religion prevents people joining the unhealthy peer groups by the establishment of moral discipline, internal and external rules, and healthy coping styles therefore, people get less attracted to <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> tobacco smoking. Accordingly, these factors should be paid more attention in prevention programs for drug use, particularly <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> tobacco that are considered as the gateway to other drugs...|$|R
5|$|The {{deployment}} of Spitfires to Australia was kept secret {{so that the}} Japanese were not alerted to their presence, and the Australian Government directed that the aircraft {{be referred to as}} Capstans (after the brand of <b>cigarettes)</b> <b>and</b> their Merlin engines as Marvels. General Douglas MacArthur, the commander of Allied forces in the South West Pacific Area, agreed that the Australian Government could choose when to announce the presence of the Spitfires, but warned against exaggerating the impact they were likely to have.|$|E

5|$|By 1910, {{there were}} 18 daily {{services}} along the Clevedon branch, four on Sundays. A GWR pagoda hut {{was built in}} the 1910s at the east end of the eastbound platform, but this was removed some ten years later. By the 1920s Yatton had 40 staff employed, including a boy selling chocolate and <b>cigarettes,</b> <b>and</b> issued almost 60,000 tickets. Traffic on the Clevedon branch was still climbing, now up to 21 services on weekdays and five on Sundays. However, despite this success, there were some problems. Better road transport was reducing traffic along the Wrington line, and the main line was stretched to capacity. To combat this latter problem, goods loops were laid either side of the station – east for 1.25 miles to Claverham from 6 April 1925 and west for 1.75 miles to Huish level crossing on 26 May 1925. The station itself however remained a two-track pinch point.|$|E
30|$|For example, Eitzinger and Pirker (2005) {{described}} a {{computational fluid dynamic}} model of a free smouldering <b>cigarette,</b> <b>and</b> attempted to mathematically induce contact between the smouldering <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> the 10 -layer filter paper substrate as defined in ASTM E 2187. Their free-smouldering model predicted that both a reduced variation of <b>cigarette</b> parameters <b>and</b> the appropriate choice of oxygen diffusion coefficient are equally important in designing cigarette papers for reduced ignition propensity. However, the non-steady-state transient contact between the smouldering <b>cigarette</b> <b>and</b> the substrate proved to be too difficult to solve mathematically. A percentage of test cigarettes are always extinguished during this initial transient contact with the substrate, and {{further research is needed}} to understand the mechanism involved in this non-steady-state phenomenon.|$|R

Around 4 a.m., Hendrix, struggling with insomnia after having consumed amphetamines hours earlier, asked her for sleeping tablets. She later said she refused his request hoping he would fall asleep naturally. Dannemann said she surreptitiously took a sleeping tablet sometime around 6 a.m., with Hendrix still awake. She awoke sometime between 10 and 10:20a.m. to find him sleeping normally in bed next to her. She said she then left to purchase <b>cigarettes,</b> <b>and</b> when she returned around 11 a.m., found him in bed breathing, although unconscious and unresponsive. She telephoned for an ambulance at 11:18a.m. and one arrived at 11:27a.m.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{known for}} his smoking character, Davis quit smoking in the 1970s; when The X-Files started up, {{he was given a}} choice between herbal <b>cigarettes</b> <b>and</b> tobacco cigarettes. At first, he chose to use tobacco cigarettes, but {{switched}} to herbal because he was afraid of becoming addicted to them again. Davis used his notoriety on the show to assist the Canadian Cancer Society in its programs to combat smoking. In 2014, Davis donated his investments that support fossil fuels to the David Suzuki Foundation in an effort to both ethically invest, and help fund work to fight climate change. Davis is a passionate advocate for action in response to climate change, believes it is a critical issue of our time and speaks on the subject often. Taking action on a personal level, Davis drives a Tesla powered by hydroelectricity.|$|E
5|$|Edward habitually smoked twenty <b>cigarettes</b> <b>and</b> twelve cigars a day. In 1907, a rodent ulcer, a type {{of cancer}} {{affecting}} the skin next to his nose, was cured with radium. Towards {{the end of his}} life he increasingly suffered from bronchitis. He suffered a momentary loss of consciousness during a state visit to Berlin in February 1909. In March 1910, he was staying at Biarritz when he collapsed. He remained there to convalesce, while in London Asquith tried to get the Finance Bill passed. The King's continued ill health was unreported and he attracted criticism for staying in France while political tensions were so high. On 27 April he returned to Buckingham Palace, still suffering from severe bronchitis. Alexandra returned from visiting her brother, King George I of Greece, in Corfu a week later on 5 May.|$|E

5|$|In {{the same}} year, Vogue did a spread called “Grunge & Glory” with fashion {{photographer}} Steven Miesel who shot supermodels Naomi Campbell and Kristen McMenamy in a savanna landscape wearing grunge-styled clothing. This shoot made McMenamy the face for grunge, {{as she had}} her eyebrows shaved and her hair cropped short. Designers like Christian Lacroix, Donna Karen and Karl Lagerfeld incorporated the grunge influence into their looks. In 1993, James Truman, editor of Details, said: “to me the thing about grunge is it’s not anti-fashion, it’s unfashion. Punk was anti-fashion. It made a statement. Grunge is about not making a statement, which is why it’s crazy for it to become a fashion statement.” The unkempt fashion sense defined {{the look of the}} “slacker generation”, who “skipped school, smoked pot... <b>cigarettes</b> <b>and</b> listened to music” hoping to become a rock star one day.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2003, the band went into a studio to write and record new {{material}} for a new album, tentatively titled <b>Cigarettes</b> <b>and</b> Valentines. After completing 20 tracks, the master recordings were stolen from the studio. Instead of re-recording the stolen tracks, the band decided to abandon the entire project and start over, considering the taken material to be unrepresentative of the band's best work. It was then revealed that a band called The Network was signed to Armstrong's record label Adeline Records with little fanfare and information. After the mysterious band released an album called Money Money 2020, it was rumored that The Network was a Green Day side project, due to the similarities in the bands' sounds. However, these rumors were never addressed by the band or Adeline Records, except for a statement on the Adeline website discussing an ongoing dispute between the two bands.|$|E
