40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to numerically {{investigate}} one source of acoustic noise in roller bearings, that which results from the motion of the rollers in the bearing under zero exter-nal load. For the sake of simplification, it was assumed that the <b>cylindrical</b> roller <b>bearings</b> are infinitely long. Furthermore, the effects of the following on the noise of the bearing were also examined: the radial clearance of the bearing, the viscosity of the lubricant, and the number of rollers. The results of the study show that the fundamental frequency of the noise components of the <b>cylindrical</b> roller <b>bearing</b> corresponds to the multiplica-tion of the number of rollers and the whirling frequency of the roller center. The acoustical frequency spectra of the <b>cylindrical</b> roller <b>bearing</b> are pure tone spectra, containing the fundamental frequency of the roller bearing and its superharmonics. The fac-tors that decrease the sound pressure level of a <b>cylindrical</b> roller <b>bearing</b> include low lubricant viscosity, high radial clearance, and a reduced number of rollers.

40|$|Abstract—Applications of {{permanent}} magnets bearings have gained a new interest {{thanks to the}} development of rare earth materials, characterised by residual magnetic induction greater than 1 T. The present paper proposes a new geometry for permanent magnets bearings with V-shaped elements, both for a plane slide and for <b>cylindrical</b> <b>bearings.</b> The aim of this geometry is to give new possibilities to the application of these bearing systems, by reducing its inherent instability. A design method, involving Finite Elements and Magnetic Field Integral Equations analyses, is also described for defining the most suitable V-opening angle and the two magnetisation directions. These parameters can be varied {{in order to reduce the}} unstable force in the coupling, and to reach the desired force and stiffness in the stable direction. The design is founded on the evaluation of four “geometric ” vectors, that depend on the geometry of the elements.

50|$|Poncet Platforms do have design limitations. They {{are usually}} {{designed}} to track for 1 hour (15° of tilt) since longer tracking could cause the instrument {{on top of}} it to topple off. After that hour the mount has to be pivoted back to the east to reset the clock drive mechanism. Since the Poncet platform has no roller bearing surfaces that can be driven, the clock drive mechanism itself has posed some design difficulty for telescope makers. Straight line drives such as threaded nut/bolt drives change drive rate when converted to a circular motion. It is also time consuming to reset via spinning the nut back to the starting point. Amateurs have tackled this by employing curved bolt designs and even using specially shaped cams to convert the straight line motion to a variable speed motion. High mechanical loadings from heavy telescopes or using them at low geographic latitudes can cause the mount to bind up, requiring more complicated improved bearing surfaces to overcome this. This has led to equatorial platform variations based on the Poncet design include Alan Gee's platform mount using a more complicated <b>cylindrical</b> <b>bearing</b> surface in place of the inclined plane, and Georges D'Autume's platform design which uses a sophisticated conical bearing system.|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 107 The use of {{long shaft}} {{vertical}} pumps is {{common practice in}} the nuclear waste processing industry. Unfortunately, when such pumps employ plain <b>cylindrical</b> journal <b>bearings,</b> they tend to suffer from rotordynamic instability problems due to the inherent lightly-loaded condition that the vertical orientation places on the bearings. This paper describes {{a case study in}} which the authors utilized rotordynamic analysis and experimental vibration analysis to diagnose such a problem and designed replacement tilting-pad bearings to solve the problem. The subject pumps are 45 foot long vertical pumps used for mixing nuclear waste in one million gallon tanks. Each pumping system consists of an induction motor driven by a variable frequency drive, a segmented pump shaft with a centrifugal impeller at the bottom, and a pipe column that surrounds the pump shaft and is suspended into the tank. The column is filled with water that serves as the lubricant for the eight plain <b>cylindrical</b> journal <b>bearings</b> that support the pump shaft. Unfortunately, these pumps have been plagued with vibration related problems, such as bearing and seal failures, ever since they were commissioned. In order to evaluate the problem, the pump shaft and column were instrumented with vibration transducers, and vibration testing was performed. This testing revealed that subsynchronous whirling, at approximately one-half the running speed, was the primary culprit responsible for the failures. In an effort to understand the cause of the observed vibrations, a two-level rotordynamic model of the pump shafting and column was constructed. This rotordynamic model, like those for many vertical pumps, was far from routine. The rotordynamic analysis, which is described in detail, then successfully confirmed that the problem was subsynchronous whirling due to rotordynamic instability. This analysis was then used to guide the design of tilting-pad bearings employing offset pivots and geometric preload to replace the original plain <b>cylindrical</b> <b>bearings</b> and, thereby, resolve the instability problem. The plain <b>cylindrical</b> <b>bearings</b> were removed from a pump, tilting-pad bearings were installed, and subsequent testing verified the predicted vibration reduction. Accordingly, the application of tilting-pad bearings, whose design is described in detail, was conclusively shown to be an effective solution for this specific problem...|$|R
