The UCCU is comprised of late Devonian to Mississippian siliciclastic rocks assigned to the Eleana Formation and Chainman Shale. The UCCU underlies the Yucca Flat area and extends westward towards Shoshone Mountain, southward to Buckboard Mesa, and northward to Rainier Mesa. Late in 2005 we collected another 14 MT stations in Mid Valley and in northern Yucca Flat basin. That work was done to better determine the extent and thickness of the UCCU near the southeastern RM-SM CAU boundary with the southwestern YF CAU, and also in the northern YF CAU.

40|$|The {{phosphate}} {{deposits in}} the western Sechura Desert, Peru, occur as pelletal phos-phate in marine sediments of Miocene age. Most of the pellets are concentrated in beds 1 to 1. 5 meters thick that contain about 20 percent PaOa. Interbedded with the phos-phorites are diatomite beds 3 to 20 meters thick, that contain 1 to 7 percent P 205. Com-binations of these beds form three major phosphatic zones which, in ascending order, are about 38 meters thick with 5. 2 percent P 205, 6 meters thick with 9. 0 percent P 205, and 2. 5 meters thick with 5. 2 percent P 203. Within these zones are combinations of beds that are relatively thick and of higher grade. such as {{the upper part of}} the lower zone which is about 10 meters thick and contains about 12 percent P 205. The composition, general <b>character,</b> <b>thickness,</b> and P 205 content of the individual phosphorite and diatomite beds are highly uniform over large areas. Sandstone and tuffs form a minor but characteristic part of this sequence. Ore from the individual beds and zones is easily upgraded by washing and desliming because of the marked differences between the diatomite particles and the phosphate pellets in size. shape, and density. Low-amplitude folds and possibly minor faults that developed during deposition play an important role in the distribution of beds within the phosphatic sequence which range from 135 to 215 meters thick. The $echura deposits are different from other major marine deposits in that they con-sist chiefly of phosphate and diatomire and the pellets are composed of a fluorine-deficient carbonate hydroxyl apatite of a type not known in other marine deposits.

The aim of this investigation is to compare and contrast the present appearance and state of preservation of {{the paintings}}, while taking into account how they were made, how they have each been employed and displayed, and the effects of previous conservation treatment. Both works are painted in oil on canvas, and were conceived and painted by Diebenkorn in his studio in Berkeley, California. The canvas was stretched on a simple wooden stretcher and prepared by the artist with a glue sizing and a white, oil-based ground. Both paintings bear similar artist’s inscriptions in paint on the canvas reverse, which give the title and the artist’s name, and indicate the proper orientation. The paint layers vary in <b>character</b> and <b>thickness.</b> Paint is applied freely and thinly, and has a generally fluid and medium-rich consistency, with occasional areas of lean background paint and heavier, impasted brushstrokes. Visible pentimenti and other evidence of reworking on the Phillips Collection paintings are typical of the artist’s analytical yet spontaneous approach. Diebenkorn worked mostly with the typical materials of oil-based tube paints mixed with linseed oil and turpentine. In 1957, after he had switched to painting figuratively, it was documented that he also used white, oil-based house paint in cans [1]. While it is reported that he mostly used such paint for the ground, he may have also mixed the fluid yet opaque paint with his artist’s colors. This would be consistent with the muted, chalky colors and general eggshell matt surface of both the Berkeley paintings, as well as two later figurative works by the artist in the Phillips Collection (c. 1957 and 1960).

As the whole free stream Mach number range of the test envelope from 0. 3 – 0. 7 was important for the structural design, transonic effects, especially shock - vortex interactions triggering vortex development, were studied. During the design of a peniche, the differences of the flow character to the reference results without wind tunnel walls were minimized.

40|$|It {{has long}} been argued that the form of North American Paleoindian points was {{affected}} by hafting. According to this hypothesis, hafting constrained point bases such that they are less variable than point blades.

None of the studies employed statistical tests, and all of them focused on points recovered from kill and camp sites, which makes it difficult to be certain that the differences in variability are the result of hafting rather than a consequence of resharpening. Here, we report a study in which we tested the predictions of the hafting hypothesis by statistically comparing the variability of different parts of Clovis points. We controlled for the potentially confounding effects of resharpening by analyzing largely unused points from caches as well as points from kill and camp sites.

In the thickness range d 20 nm, the thickness dependences of the properties exhibit an oscillatory behavior with the period Δ d ≈ 12 nm. The observed oscillatory <b>character</b> of the <b>thickness</b> dependences of the kinetic coefficients is attributed to the manifestation of quantum size effects. The theoretical S(d) dependence calculated in the approximation of size quantization taking into account d-dependences of the Fermi energy and a number of subbands is in good agreement with the experimental one with regard to the oscillation period...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [108]- 111) Geophysical {{techniques were}} employed in this investigation to distinguish between leachate and shallow buried metal objects, to determine refuse <b>character</b> and <b>thicknesses</b> within the 800 Area landfill at Argonne National Laboratory. Resistivity soundings, electromagnetic (EM) and magnetic profiles were completed across the northern portion of the landfill between 1990 and 1993 to achieve these goals. Resistivity soundings were inverted for layered earth models consisting {{of three or four}} layers. The upper moderate-resistivity layer (19 - 66 ohm-m), approximately 4 - 6 ft (1 - 2 m) thick, represents unsaturated fill (this upper layer actually comprised two layers in some cases). This is underlain by a lowresistivity layer (5 - 10 ohm-m) approximately 8 - 35 ft (3 - 12 m) thick representing leachate saturated fill. The bottom layer (20 - 90 ohm-m) represents the underlying glacial till. Seeps on the landfill near soundings 1 and 2 suggest high leachate levels. Subsequent EM and magnetic profiles identified areas of high conductivity caused by metal debris or accumulations of leachate across the northern portion of the landfill. Closure data and leachate wells installed in 1995 confirmed geophysical refuse thickness estimates and the presence of metallic debris. Elevated leachate levels, however, were not present in the leachate wells at that time. Important characteristics of the landfill that were assessed by this geophysical study include refuse thickness, identification of areas containing buried metals and shallow leachate, and possible variations in leachate levels. Each of these assessed characteristics is useful in fulfilling specific needs. Refuse thickness estimates aid in monitoring well screen placement. Determining the location of buried metals is important in locating a French drain buried in the landfill, which was used for liquid waste disposal. Finally, leachate levels must be monitored to properly manage the landfill’s water balance. Geophysics provides a quick, noninvasive method of assessing these hydrologic and waste characteristics. M.

30|$|Differences in iliac {{morphology}} {{in relation}} with the population structure (as defined in the introduction) of the hybrid klepton P. kl. P. esculentus have been investigated (Figure  2 C). Characters for the LE system and RE system have been studied separately. The few triploid individuals {{have been removed from}} the analysis. The results of the Mann-Whitney U test (Table  2) suggest that the difference between RE and LE systems are highly significant for characters 2 and 8 and significant for character 5. There is no difference for character 1 (estimate of absolute size) between the two systems with respectively 21.20 [*]±[*] 2.09 mm for RE and 21.20 [*]±[*] 3.16 mm for LE systems. Character 2 (tuber superior's orientation) is the one that seems to show the largest difference between the two systems (lowest value for two-tailed probability p), with 41.00 [*]±[*] 2.12 ° for RE and 44.00 [*]±[*] 4.37 ° for LE. Character 8 (width of the pars ascendens) although highly significant shows some tiny difference between RE (2.00 [*]±[*] 0.31 mm) and LE (1.80 [*]±[*] 0.31 mm) systems, as well as <b>character</b> 5 (acetabulum <b>thickness)</b> that although significant shows the same mean for RE (1.40 [*]±[*] 0.20 mm) than for LE (1.40 [*]±[*] 0.24 mm).|$|R

In order to enrich coalbed methane (CBM) and shale gas geological theory and promote their development process, this paper compared shale gas with CBM in accumulation, distribution, reservoir and production. It expatiated on {{the background and}} significance of the combined research and development, and analyzed the geological foundation and future prospects. Our investigation demonstrated {{that there are many}} sets of coal-bearing strata in Shanxi formation of Permian system in Ordos in North China, Longtan formation of Upper Permian and Xujiahe formation of Upper Triassic in Southern Yangtze region, Xishanyao formation of Middle Jurassic in Turpan-Hami Basin and Junggar Basin in Northwest China, and Shahezi formation of Cretaceous in Songliao Basin in northeast China. In these regions, shales which are interbeded with coal seams have the <b>characters</b> of big <b>thickness,</b> continuous distribution, high content of organic matter, good parent material and high maturity, accord with the basic geological conditions to format shale gas and CBM reservoir and composite gas reservoir, thus form appropriate regions and layers to carry out joint research and exploration with good prospects for development...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to find out the pattern of paleo channel which was formed in Banten Bay and its surrounding. Â  The aims are to find out the paleo-channel pattern at study area. The study methods are including vessel positioning, and shallow seismic reflection work. Vessel positioning method is to locate the exact position of seismic workÂ  Â Â  when recording the data from single channel of shallow seismic reflection. Seismic line orientations are determined by regional geological setting of the area. Trend of seismic lines are dominantly north â€“ south. In order to get the seismic data which could give geological setting configuration, seismic lines should be perpendicular to the strikes of the sediments. Based on the calculation of velocity of seismic refraction in sea water 1, 500 meters/second, while within sediment 1, 600 meters/second, it could be concluded that the paleo chanels were more or less in 32 meters below sea floor depth. This layer was the system that occur during the process of an interglacial on the Sunda Shelf when it was still a part of land that connects the Java, Sumatra and Kalimantan Islands. Paleo-channel deposits are characterized by subparalel - chaotic reflection <b>character</b> with a <b>thickness</b> between 5 - 35 meters...|$|R
60|$|I {{have taken}} this plant and shown {{you that this is}} the result of the ratio of the increase, the {{necessary}} result of the arrival of a time coming for every species when exactly as many members must be destroyed as are born; that is the inevitable ultimate result of the rate of production. Now, what is the result of all this? I have said that there are forty-nine struggling against every one; and it amounts to this, that the smallest possible start given to any one seed may give it an advantage which will enable it to get ahead of all the others; anything that will enable any one of these seeds to germinate six hours before any of the others will, other things being alike, enable it to choke them out altogether. I have shown you that there is no particular in which plants will not vary from each other; it is quite possible that one of our imaginary plants may vary in such a <b>character</b> as the <b>thickness</b> of the integument of its seeds; it might happen that one of the plants might produce seeds having a thinner integument, and that would enable the seeds of that plant to germinate a little quicker than those of any of the others, and those seeds would most inevitably extinguish the forty-nine times as many that were struggling with them.|$|R
40|$|High {{residual}} stresses within intermetallic and {{metal matrix composite}} systems can develop upon cooling from the processing temperature to room temperature due to the {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE) mismatch between the fiber and matrix. As a result, within certain composite systems, radial, circumferential, and/or longitudinal cracks have been observed to form at the fiber-matrix interface. The compliant layer concept (insertion of a compensating interface material between the fiber and matrix) was proposed to reduce or eliminate the residual stress buildup during cooling and thus minimize cracking. The viability of the proposed compliant layer concept is investigated both elastically and elastoplastically. A detailed parametric study was conducted using a unit cell model consisting of three concentric cylinders to determine the required <b>character</b> (i. e., <b>thickness</b> and material properties) of the compliant layer as well as its applicability. The unknown compliant layer mechanical properties were expressed as ratios of the corresponding temperature dependent Ti- 24 Al- 11 Nb (a/o) matrix properties. The fiber properties taken were those corresponding to SCS- 6 (SiC). Results indicate that the compliant layer can be used to reduce, if not eliminate, radial and circumferential {{residual stresses}} within the fiber and matrix and therefore also reduce or eliminate the radial cracking. However, with this decrease in in-plane stresses, one obtains an increase in longitudinal stress, thus potentially initiating longitudinal cracking. Guidelines are given for the selection of a specific compliant material, given a perfectly bonded system...|$|R
40|$|Precambrian tectonic {{processes}} are debated: {{what was the}} nature and scale of orogenic events on the younger, hotter, and more ductile Earth? Northern Hudson Bay records the Paleoproterozoic collision between the Western Churchill and Superior plates—the ∼ 1. 8 Ga Trans-Hudson Orogeny (THO) —and is an ideal locality to study Precambrian tectonic structure. Integrated field, geochronological, and thermobarometric {{studies suggest that the}} THO was comparable to the present-day Himalayan-Karakoram-Tibet Orogen (HKTO). However, detailed understanding of the deep crustal architecture of the THO, and how it compares to that of the evolving HKTO, is lacking. The joint inversion of receiver functions and surface wave data provides new Moho depth estimates and shear velocity models for the crust and uppermost mantle of the THO. Most of the Archean crust is relatively thin (∼ 39 km) and structurally simple, with a sharp Moho; upper-crustal wave speed variations are attributed to postformation events. However, the Quebec-Baffin segment of the THO has a deeper Moho (∼ 45 km) and a more complex crustal structure. Observations show some similarity to recent models, computed using the same methods, of the HKTO crust. Based on Moho <b>character,</b> present-day crustal <b>thickness,</b> and metamorphic grade, we support the view that southern Baffin Island experienced thickening during the THO of a similar magnitude and width to present-day Tibet. Fast seismic velocities at > 10 km below southern Baffin Island {{may be the result of}} partial eclogitization of the lower crust during the THO, as is currently thought to be happening in Tibet...|$|R

Analysis of variance revealed that high significant differences among clones existed for all <b>characters</b> except stone <b>thickness.</b> The clones were grouped into two clusters. Cluster I, which consists of the clones DPL-I, RTN-I, DEV- 1, VEN- 1, DWR-I, DWD-II, DWD-III and BGM-II had the highest length of fruit (14. 37 cm), stone thickness (2. 24 cm), percentage of pulp (71. 58), pulp to stone ratio (4. 75 : 1), pulp to peel Ratio (5. 21 : 1) and shelf life (19. 85 days). Cluster-II, comprising of the clones BGM- 1 recorded significantly highest total fruit weight 260. 8 g), diameter of fruit (70. 22 cm), weight of peel (40. 79 g), stone weight (41. 88 g) and weight of pulp (178. 46 g). Regarding quality parameters, the highest values were observed for total soluble solids as (16. 690 B), ascorbic acid (54. 92 mg/ 100 g) and total sugar (13. 42 mg/ 100 g) in cluster-I. Similarly in cluster-II. The highest values were recorded in titrable acidity (0. 56 %) and reducing sugar (3. 81 mg/ 100 g). No relationship between geographical origin and genetic diversity was established. Selecting clones from divergent clusters and utilizing them in hybridization programme is likely to produce desirable segregant in subsequent generations and may lead to improvement in Alphonso mango for yield and quality traits...|$|R
