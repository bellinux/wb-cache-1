5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century the {{distinctive}} Scottish use of stone architecture declined as it was replaced by cheaper alternatives such as Portland <b>cement,</b> <b>concrete,</b> and mass-production brick. Stone would however be retained as a material for some housing stock in Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dumfries, and would undergo revivals. In {{the twentieth century}} private architecture was increasingly client driven. James Robert Rhind (1854–1918), the son of David Rhind, was successful in the competition for new libraries to be constructed in Glasgow following Andrew Carnegie's gift of £100,000 to the city in 1901. His designs were selected for seven libraries, allowing him to demonstrate his individual interpretation of Edwardian Baroque architecture. Rhind's libraries were all built with locally quarried sandstone, which blended in with the existing tenement neighbourhoods. His landmark buildings were greatly enhanced by his liberal use of columns, domes and sculpted features. James Miller (1860–1947) is noted for his Scottish railway stations, such as his 1901–05 extensions to Glasgow Central railway station, and the spectacular Wemyss Bay railway station on the Firth of Clyde.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to identify High Early-Age Strength (HES) concrete batch designs, and evaluate their suitability for use in the rapid repair of highways and bridge decks. To this end, two criteria needed to be met; a minimum compressive strength of 20. 68 MPa (3000 psi) in no later than 12 hours, and a drying shrinkage of less than 0. 06 % at 28 days after curing. The evaluations included both air-entrained, and non-air-entrained <b>concretes.</b> The <b>cement</b> types chosen for this study included Type III and Type V Portland cement and “Rapid Set” − a Calcium Sulfoaluminate (CSA) cement. In addition, two blended concretes containing different ratios of Type V Portland cement and CSA cement were investigated. The evaluation of the studied concretes included mechanical properties (compressive and flexural strength) and transport properties (absorption, rapid chloride penetration– RCPT, rapid chloride migration– RMT, and water permeability). Additionally, dimensional stability (drying shrinkage) and durability (corrosion of steel, frost resistance, and abrasion resistance) were investigated. Evaluations were conducted based on cement type and common cement factor. Fresh property tests showed that in order to provide a comparable workability, and still remain within manufactures guideline for plasticizer, the water-to-cement ratio was adjusted for each type of cement utilized. This resulted in the need to increase the water-to-cement ratio as the Blaine Fineness of the cement type increased (0. 275 for Type V Portland cement, 0. 35 for Type III Portland cement, and 0. 4 for Rapid Set cement). It was also observed that negligible changes in setting time occurred with increasing cement content, whereas changes in cement type produced notable differences. The addition of air-entrainment had beneficial effect on workability for the lower cement factors. Increasing trends for peak hydration heat were seen with increases in cement factor, cement Blaine Fineness, and accelerator dosage. Evaluation of hardened properties revealed opening times as low as 5 hours for Type V Portland cement with 2. 0 % accelerator per cement weight and further reduction in opening time by an hour when accelerator dosage was increased to 2. 8 % by cement weight. When Type III Portland cement and Rapid Set cement were used, the opening time reduced to as low as 4. 5 hours and 1 hour, respectively. The results for Type V Portland <b>cement</b> <b>concretes</b> showed that as cement factor increased so did mechanical properties until the cement factor exceeded 504 kg/m 3 (850 lb/yd 3), at which point the peak heat of hydration exceeded 46. 1 °C (115 °F) and the mechanical properties decreased. Other evaluations on the studied High Early-Age Strength Type V Portland <b>cement</b> <b>concretes</b> revealed increases in absorption, rapid chloride penetration, water permeability, drying shrinkage, corrosion resistance, and resistance to wear with increases in cement content. On the other hand, rapid chloride migration and frost resistance decreased with increasing cement factor. Increasing the accelerator dosage resulted in an increase in all properties of the HES Type V <b>cement</b> <b>concretes</b> except for frost resistance, which decreased. The addition of air-entrainment had adverse effects on compressive strength, absorption, and rapid chloride migration; while showing lower values for rapid chloride penetration. Curing had positive effects on all hardened properties of the studied HES concretes containing Type V cement. When examining the studied Type III Portland <b>cement</b> <b>concretes,</b> it was seen that an increase in cement content led to decreases in mechanical properties. It is noted that the peak heat of hydration for these concrete exceeded the threshold of 46. 1 °C (115 °F). In addition, increases in cement factor also resulted in decreases in rapid chloride migration, frost resistance and resistance to wear. Increases in cement content resulted in increases in absorption, rapid chloride penetration, water permeability, drying shrinkage, and corrosion resistance. The use of air-entrainment imparted decreases in compressive strength and rapid chloride penetration, increases in absorption, and negligible effects on rapid chloride migration. Extending curing period resulted in beneficial effects on all properties of the studied Type III <b>cement</b> <b>concretes.</b> The studied CSA <b>cement</b> <b>concretes</b> had slightly decreasing strength trends as cement content was increased. <b>Concretes</b> containing CSA <b>cement</b> produced the lowest opening time (one hour) and the highest peak hydration heats of all concretes studied. While its corrosion and frost resistance reduced as cement content increased, the absorption and rapid chloride penetration increased with increasing cement content. For drying shrinkage, opening time curing showed more volume change with increasing cement content, whereas extending curing to 24 hours and 28 days resulted in reduction of drying shrinkage. Increasing cement factor had minimal effects on water permeability and abrasion resistance. Air-entrainments reduced compressive strength, but increased absorption and rapid chloride penetration. Rapid chloride migration was found to be incompatible with CSA <b>cements</b> <b>concretes.</b> All hardened properties of the studied CSA <b>cement</b> <b>concretes</b> improved once curing age was extended to 24 hours and 28 days. When considering the results of the HES blended <b>cement</b> <b>concretes,</b> as Type V cement content increased, 28 -day compressive strength, flexural strength, drying shrinkage (opening time and 24 -hour), corrosion resistance, and resistance to wear increased. Conversely, 24 -hour compressive strength, absorption, rapid chloride penetration, 28 -day rapid chloride migration, water penetration, 28 -day drying shrinkage, and frost resistance reduced with an increase in Type V Portland cement of the High Early-Age Strength blended <b>cement</b> <b>concretes.</b> Reductions in compressive strength and absorption occurred for both studied blended <b>cement</b> <b>concretes</b> when air-entraining admixtures were used.

In the next phase, similar treatment was given to the tomb's first chabutra (plinth), which was originally paved with large blocks of quartzite stone, some weighing over a 1,000kg. In the 1940s, an uneven settlement in the lower plinth had been corrected by covering it with a layer of concrete, adding to the disfigurement of the original Mughal flooring, which matched with that at the West Gate.|$|E

Stone would however be retained as a material for some housing stock in Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dumfries, and would undergo revivals. During the First World War the government became increasingly aware of Scotland's housing problems, particularly after the Glasgow rent strike of 1915. A royal commission of 1917 reported on the [...] "unspeakably filthy privy-middens {{in many of the}} mining areas, badly constructed incurably damp labourers' cottages on farms, whole townships unfit for human occupation in the crofting counties and islands... groups of lightless and unventilated houses in the older burghs, clotted masses of slums in the great cities". The result was a massive programme of council house building. In 1914 90 per cent of housing stock was in private hands, but by 1981 public sector housing would be peak at 55 per cent (compared with 29.1 per cent in England and Wales). Many early council houses were built on greenfield sites away from the pollution of the city, often constructed of semi-detached homes or terraced cottages. Knightswood, north-west of Glasgow, was built as a show piece from 1923–29, with a library, social centre and seven shopping [...] "parades".

500|$|Although many South Pasadena {{residents}} {{opposed the}} division of the city that the parkway would bring, the city's voters elected supporters in the 1936 elections. The state, which had the power to put the road where it wished even had South Pasadena continued to oppose it, approved the route on April 4, 1936. The route used the Arroyo Seco's west bank to near Hough Street, where it crossed to the east and cut through South Pasadena to the south end of Broadway (now Arroyo Parkway) in Pasadena. Another project, the Arroyo Seco Flood Control Channel, was built by the Works Progress Administration before and during construction of the parkway to avoid damages from future floods. A number of state engineers toured East Coast roads in early 1938, including Chicago's Lake Shore Drive, full and modified cloverleaf interchanges in Massachusetts and New Jersey, and Robert Moses's parkway system in New York City. The parkway was the first road built in California under a 1939 freeway law that allowed access to be completely limited to a number of specified points. Although, in some areas, it was possible to use a standard diamond interchange, other locations required folded diamonds, or, as the engineers called them, [...] "compressed cloverleafs", where local streets often took the place of dedicated ramps, ending at the parkway with a sharp right turn required to enter or exit. The highway was designed with two 11–12foot (3.4-3.7m) lanes and one ten-foot (3.0m) shoulder in each direction, with the wider inside (passing) lanes paved in black asphalt concrete and the outside lanes paved in gray Portland <b>cement</b> <b>concrete.</b> The differently-colored lanes would encourage drivers to stay in their lanes.
