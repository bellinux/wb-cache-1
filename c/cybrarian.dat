50|$|The {{increasing}} role {{of technology}} in libraries has {{a significant impact on}} the changing roles of librarians. New technologies are dramatically increasing the accessibility of information, and librarians are adapting to the evolving needs of users that emerge from the adoption of these new technologies. Digital librarians have become ubiquitous in the Information Age, so much so that a new word has been coined for such digital curators: <b>Cybrarian,</b> which is a portmontau of the words cyber (Internet) and librarian. A cybrarian- the term being used first by Michel Bauwens, who is the Information Officer at BP Nutrition in Antwerp, Belgium- is someone who concerns themselves primarily with the role that technology plays in a traditional library setting.|$|E

It is an emerging technology characterized by an element of novelty where the research community has recently embarked. Since, 2008 explosively increasing amount of research has been conducted. This paper presents a descriptive literature review of cloud computing paradigm from vivid perspectives. There has been drastic shift in the trinity of libraries: books which have become electronic, user which prefers web resources than print and the staff which has become <b>cybrarian.</b> In this changed library landscape there is need to shift our competencies for the challenges offered by IT. Availability of independent computing components on demand like cloud as CPU, Storage in cloud has removed the web of IT and librarians can focus on their mission and services. In this paper we analyze the normative literature to extract a functional methodology or working model of cloud computing to be implied in libraries...|$|E
40|$|Education aims {{to impart}} {{knowledge}} and makes good citizens. Libraries are the repositories {{of knowledge and}} form {{an integral part of}} education. Libraries have a long history, starting with the chained and closed-access libraries of earlier times to the present-day hybrid, digital, and virtual libraries that use the latest technology for provision of information through various services. Accordingly, librarians have also changed from storekeepers who were concerned with protection of books against theft, mutilation, and pilferage, to that of information officers, navigators, and <b>cybrarians</b> who find themselves in the vast ocean of reading material and are busy in satisfying their clients who want anytime and anywhere information. With the advent of computers, the nature of libraries has changed dramatically. Computers are being used in libraries to process, store, retrieve and disseminate information. As a result, the traditional concept of library is being redefined from a place to access books to one which houses the most advanced media including CD-ROM, Internet, and remote access {{to a wide range of}} resources. Libraries have now metamorphosed into digital institutions. Gone are the days when a library was judged by its quantitative resources. Today, libraries are surrounded by networked data that is connected to a vast ocean of Internet-based services. Moreover, electronic resources relevant to the professions are developing at an unprecedented pace. Academic libraries are considered to be the nerve centres of academic institutions, and must support teaching, research, and other academic programmes. The situation in academic libraries of India is the same as that of academic libraries the world over; however, Indian libraries must provide maximum information with limited resources...|$|R
40|$|Presently, it is {{a matter}} of {{discussion}} that, library and librarian will become redundant in the tech-based education system. Some may thinks that library without wall and library without librarian are the same. Practically these two are quite different from each other. In the virtual library era it is somehow possible to have a library without wall. The role of the librarian and library professional just changes their identity, e. g. <b>Cybrarian,</b> Information Processor, Information Consultant, etc. To cope with the rapid changes of the technology and to control the ephemeral rate of information generation, librarians along with his professional colleagues should have to equip themselves as per the requirement of the electronic information society. In the light of the above, the present paper would like to highlight the reasons why library and librarian is essential in the modern technology based library service era. The paper also tries to point out the role of the librarian in the changing society, services offered by the e-library, e-learning and issues faced by the librarian...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} the facilities and {{services provided by}} libraries in support of borderless e-education, using the University of Queensland Cybrary as a case study. The traditional paradigm of the library, as a physical place frequented by scholars and students, accessing recorded knowledge in books and journals, using bibliographic records assisted by librarians, who guarded the collections, has gone. With the availability of electronic forms of information, stored locally and accessed remotely, the new paradigm is the Cybrary – a gateway for clients located anywhere to access electronic resources any place, any pace and any time. The <b>Cybrarian</b> is a navigator and guide and the Cybrary is the window on the world of knowledge. The effectiveness of the Cybrary in service delivery is dependent upon the effective implementation of information technology, combined with appropriate training for both cybrary staff and users. The Cybrary uses a highly developed website to provide integrated access to printed and electronic resources located locally and remotely. From the website, the information searcher has access to electronic databases, electronic journals and Internet resources {{all of which can}} be searched/browsed by subject.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the {{procedures}} and processes involved at the University of Queensland Library in its transition to a digital library, {{now known as the}} Cybrary, and describes the resultant information services available to students, scholars, and practitioners. As Australia’s first virtual library, the University of Queensland Library has been recognised by the Australian Award for University Teaching in 1998 and again in 2000. ([URL]) The UQ Library {{is also a member of}} QULOC, the Queensland University Libraries Office of Cooperation, a consortium which initiates and supports cooperative world class solutions to information resource needs of university libraries in its member institutions. The traditional paradigm of the library was a physical place where scholars and students went to gain access to recorded knowledge using bibliographic records to guide them to rows of shelves of printed materials. Librarians guarded collections and assisted users. Much has changed in recent times. With the availability of electronic forms of information, stored locally, and accessed remotely, the new paradigm is the Cybrary – a gateway for clients located anywhere to access electronic resources everywhere and at any time. The <b>Cybrarian</b> is a navigator and guide. The Cybrary is the window on the world of knowledge. The effectiveness of the Cybrary in service delivery is dependent upon the effective implementation of information technology, combined with appropriate training for both cybrary staff and end users. The Cybrary uses a single interface to provide integrated access to its printed and electronic resources and services - the Library’s website. From the website, the information searcher has access to electronic databases, electronic journals, and Internet resources all of which can be searched/browsed by subject. Help tools are also available online to guide the searcher through the range of resources. The availability of remote access to information greatly facilitates the delivery of education to distant students, and enables the access to information by remote workers in the field. It revolutionises opportunity for students, scholars and practitioners alike. Many of the functions of the Cybrary are enhanced and supported through its membership of the Consortium, which is used as a vehicle for such activities as information sharing, continuing education, staff development, and cooperative research and development projects...|$|E
