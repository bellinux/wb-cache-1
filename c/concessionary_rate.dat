50|$|Agriculture in Oman {{has been}} {{important}} for centuries. The government's economic development policy emphasizes {{the expansion of}} such non-oil sectors as agriculture, fishing, industry, and mining in its bid to diversify the economy and diminish its dependence on oil exports. The goal {{is to establish a}} sustainable economic base in preparation for the time when hydrocarbon reserves are depleted. The government launched several economic campaigns, naming 1988 and 1989 as Years of Agriculture and 1991 and 1992 as Years of Industry. Through these campaigns, the government has encouraged private-sector investment by allocating generous amounts of cash support for private industry to be disbursed mainly through official development banks. For example, the Oman Bank for Agriculture and Fisheries, created in 1981, extends loans at <b>concessionary</b> <b>rates</b> to individuals for whom farming or fishing is the principal activity. The bank acts as a distributive institution, receiving an interest subsidy from the government. In 1990 there were 1,308 loans, totaling RO4.7 million.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the merits of a full privatization policy of the HDB <b>concessionary</b> <b>rate</b> mortgage loans. It is believed that price competition among domestic banks will be infused and sustained, resulting in improved efficiency for the banking sector and the economy. Design/methodology/approach - This paper first compares the loan interest rates of the domestic banks for HDB flat buyers to the HDB concessionary interest-rates. Then it investigates the performance of the HDB, by assessing whether its mortgage yields are able to meet the requirements set forth by means of HDB's hurdle rates. Findings - The findings suggest that HDB's mortgage yields are insufficient in meeting the performance standards set by the HDB, reflected by the hurdle rate. In conclusion, it is recommended that the HDB should further delegate this part of business to the private sector, where better financial performances are expected among domestic banks under competitions. Research limitations/implications - This paper is confined to mortgages subject to constant interest rates over time, despite, firstly, the availability of floating-rate mortgages on the market, and, secondly, the quarterly revised fixed rate mortgages offered by the HDB. Originality/value - While sharing some structural similarities with the USA on mortgage finance, disparities in the degree of government involvement in the mortgage market of Singapore makes it worth studying. Also, it sheds light on further studies on other nations with similar features, such as the presence of strong government support in the mortgage finance sector.

The population for the study was 28 tutors and 700 students. A stratified simple random sample by faculty of 50 respondents was used for this study. Data were solicited from the respondents through telephone interviews and questionnaires. Results from the study show {{that a number of}} factors have affected the full utilisation of internet based technologies in tutoring. Socio-economic factors such as salary levels of respondents and cost of the gadgets affect adoption and use of the internet based platforms. Most learners did not possess the basic ICT gadgets such as computers. The younger respondents, however, have embraced the electronic gadgets more than the older generation which is fearful of the new technology. The study, therefore, recommended that there be training in the basic computer usage. The institution should provide gadgets at district centres to reduce on the distances travelled by students. Students need assistance to facilitate acquisition of ICT gadgets from the providers at <b>concessionary</b> <b>rates</b> as has been the case for tutors...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two essays and studies topics on sovereign debt. The first essay analyzes, using duration models, the factors that affect {{the length of time}} a country in default is excluded from the international credit markets. It shows that disclosure of information by the debtor will lead to a reduction in the time of the negotiation; that is, an increase in the settlement rate. This disclosure of information can be in the form of previous default or the credible announcement of fiscal reforms. Engaging in debt reduction or rescheduling under <b>concessionary</b> <b>rates</b> hurts the debtor's probability of reaching an agreement and settling the debt. The second essay proposes a dynamic model of sovereign debt that combines default, settlement, and repayment history. The model addresses two questions: 1) how level of debt and income profile affect the length of time a country in default is excluded from the international credit market, and 2) how repayment history shapes the credit limit and interest rate lenders offer, and the borrower's incentive to default. In the model, borrowers weigh the benefits from defaulting against the penalties associated with it, namely a lengthy exclusion from the market and a potential deterioration in the credit terms. The settlement is modeled as a random process conditioned on the portion of the defaulted debt borrowers agree to repay. The model incorporates repayment history into the information set used by lenders. Quantitative analysis shows that the model can replicate some key stylized facts of sovereign debt: 1) settlement offers depend positively on a debtor's current income level and negatively on its level of debt; 2) the debt-to-GDP ratio that new borrowers or serial defaulters can support is well below the ratio that proven debtors can safely manage; 3) the probability of default is larger for debtors with recent payment difficulties; 4) once a country defaults, it takes many years of flawless repayment and low levels of debt for that country to gain continuous access to international credit markets at low cost; this process is slow and backsliding into default is difficult to avoid...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether <b>concessionary</b> tax <b>rates</b> and {{tax incentives}} can attract {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI) into certain designated areas in China. Since China opened its doors to foreign investors in 1979, tax benefits have been used extensively to attract FDI into different areas. In 1991, a new tax law was introduced which superseded two previous income tax laws. This new law provides additional tax benefits which improve the investment environment for foreign investors. This study investigates the effect of China's tax rates and tax incentive policy on FDI and on the locational choices of foreign firms. Our empirical results indicate that tax rates and incentives are important determinants of regional investment decisions in China, after controlling for potential confounding variables covering infrastructure, unemployment rate, wage rate and agglomeration economics. Specifically, areas offering lower tax rates and increased tax incentives are found to attract greater amounts of FDI. The impetus of the tax effect on FDI is more apparent in the post- 1991 period due {{to changes in the}} tax laws. Our results also suggest that infrastructure variables are important determinants of regional investment decisions. School of Accounting and Financ...|$|R

To achieve the study objectives, structured questionnaire were designed and administered to ninety farmers who were selected using a multistage random sampling technique. Data collected were analysed using descriptive statistics regression analysis and Pearson product moment correlation (PPMC). Findings shows that the farmers were mainly small scale middle aged married men with secondary education and no access to credit. The average house hold size, farming experience and annual income of the farmers were 6 person, 15. 5 years and N 148, 255. 6 respectively with two contacts with extension agents on monthly basis.

During the same period, the Census shows a thirty percent {{decrease in the number of}} farmers under age 25. Young and beginning producers (YBPs) entering agriculture face high startup costs and a shortage of land to own or rent. With these concerns in mind, this manuscript details the impact of an innovative proposed loan program for YBPs in Arkansas, which would offer <b>concessionary</b> interest <b>rates</b> and loan fees by participating banks for adopting selections from a menu of practices that achieve environmental improvements along with maintaining or improving farm profits on cropland. The practices selected for this proposed loan program include: (1) conservation tillage; (2) integrated pest management; (3) buffers; (4) cover crops; (5) land leveling; (6) underground irrigation pipe; (7) crop rotations; (8) tailwater recovery systems; (9) planting seed varieties that require less water, fertilizer, chemicals, or other inputs; and (10) following the irrigation and planting standards in the Arkansas crop production handbooks. The proposed project would help these YBPs become more profitable producers, reduce FCS 2 ̆ 7 s risk on loaning to YBPs, and help create a new class of potential borrowers who need a little extra assistance to become more successful over the longer term. To measure the loan program 2 ̆ 7 s impact, budgets were developed for corn, cotton, rice, soybeans, and wheat prior to loan program participation. Budgets were then developed and compared to determine the YBP profitability on these five crops from adoption of no-till, a crop rotation, or a no-till crop rotation and program participation. Results indicate YBP per acre profitability is improved from loan program participation and adopting program practices...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} four decades Sierra Leone {{established}} several credit schemes to help farmers increase production, productivity and incomes. This was motivated by several factors including the high proportion of the population in agriculture, the relative poverty of farmers and their subsistencele vel of production. Cheap credit was seen as the appropriate instrument to achieve market-oriented production. But these schemes failed due mainly to <b>concessionary</b> interest <b>rates,</b> high default, lack of savings mobilisation, mismanagement and poor economic policies. In March, 1985, a rural banking scheme was launched to replace these failed schemes; and by 1994, eight rural banks were in operation. The main objectives were to mobilise savings and to provide credit to agriculture and other rural enterprises. In early 1990, it was realised that these banks were far from achieving these objectives. This study examines and identifies the factors responsible for their low levels of achievement. The study reveals that huge losses were made due to several reasons among which are low interest rates for savings and loans which were typically below market rates and inflation suggesting negative returns on interest income, high default, poor economic environment and poor market infrastructure. These factors made rural banks unsustainable and highly subsidy dependent. The study further reveals that informal financial sources (i. e. moneylenders and osusu clubs) have been rendering services for which rural banks were not designed, In addition, rural banks and their clients were incurring relatively higher transaction costs compared to the informal sources and their clients. The study therefore recommends a restructuring of rural banks and suggests policies to improve their operations. In the main, institution-building is recommended, and that the operational flexibility of the informal financial sector be incorporated into the policies of rural banks. We recognise that Sierra Leone is going through a period of internal conflict. But these recommendations need to be urgently implemented to forestall the collapse of these rural banks...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. As indicated by the title {{the purpose of the}} thesis is to trace the development of social legislation for blind or deaf persons in England between 1834 and 1939. No attempt is made to deal with assistance whether from statutory or voluntary sources for war blinded or deafened persons. In the first chapter a survey is made of the position of the blind or deaf under the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834 and succeeding Poor Law legislation up to 1919. Chapter two deals with the enquiry into the condition of the blind carried out in 1874 - 75 by the Charity Organisation Society and the much more comprehensive survey {{of the state of the}} blind or deaf made between 1884 and 1888 by the Royal Commission on the Blind, Deaf and Dumb which reported in 1889. The latter enquiry resulted in the passing of the Education (Blind and Deaf Children) Act of 1893 and also provided the essential data on which state action for the two disabilities could be based. The third chapter gives an account of the campaign to secure legislation for the blind which culminated in the Blind Persons Act of 1920. How the Blind Persons Act was implemented at the local level and the effect on blind welfare of the work of the Advisory Committee on the Welfare of the Blind and the passing of the Local Government Act of 1929, is the concern of chapter four. Chapter five describes the events leading up to the enactment of legislation relating to the issue of free dog licences in respect of guide dogs for the blind, <b>concessionary</b> postal <b>rates,</b> reduced fees in respect of wireless receiving licences, and the Blind Voters Act of 1933. In Chapter six the story of the campaign for legislation for the blind is continued up to the passing of the Blind Persons Act of 1938. The penultimate chapter relates the attempts made to secure legislation provision for the deaf in the form of a Deaf Persons Act broadly similar in scope to the Acts on behalf of the blind. The thesis concludes with a consideration of certain conclusions drawn from the subject matter presented in the preceding chapters...|$|R
