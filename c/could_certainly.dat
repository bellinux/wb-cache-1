5|$|As {{the trial}} progressed however, Le Gris' {{testimony}} suffered several blows. The unwavering accusations directed at him by Marguerite and the shame such accusations brought to her were, {{in the eyes}} of the court, a powerful reason why the charges were not invented. Then, even as the trial progressed, one of the men providing Le Gris' alibi, named Jean Beloteau, was arrested in Paris and charged with rape. This charge seriously undermined Beloteau's testimony and Le Gris' defence. Finally, Carrouges himself offered counter-testimony in court that a healthy, strong man with long experience of horsemanship and a stable full of horses like Le Gris <b>could</b> <b>certainly</b> have made the 50mile trip without difficulty, even accounting for the snow.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, Tillman accused {{his junior}} {{colleague}} from South Carolina, John L. McLaurin, {{of corruption in}} a speech to the Senate. McLaurin, who had been a Tillmanite before breaking from him after being elected to the Senate, called him a liar, whereupon Tillman rushed across the Senate floor and punched McLaurin in the face. McLaurin reciprocated, giving Tillman a bloody nose before the Sergeant at Arms and senators intervened. The body immediately went into closed session, and held both men in contempt. The Senate considered suspending them, but Tillman argued that it was unfair to deprive South Carolina of her representation, though the body <b>could</b> <b>certainly</b> expel the two men—knowing he had enough Democratic votes to prevent it. In the end, both men were censured, and later that year, Tillman arranged for McLaurin, whose term ended in 1903, to not be re-elected.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, many stone Norman keeps made {{considerable}} compromises {{to military}} utility. Norwich Castle, for example, included elaborate blind arcading {{on the outside}} of the building and appears to have had an entrance route designed for public ceremony, rather than for defence. The interior of the keep at Hedingham <b>could</b> <b>certainly</b> have hosted impressive ceremonies and events, but contained numerous flaws from a military perspective. Important early English and Welsh keeps such as the White Tower, Colchester, and Chepstow were all built in a distinctive Romanesque style, often reusing Roman materials and sites, and were almost certainly intended to impress and generate a political effect amongst local people. The political value of these keep designs, and the social prestige they lent to their builders, may help explain why they continued to be built in England into the late 12th century, beyond the point when military theory would have suggested that alternative designs were adopted.|$|E

25|$|For example, {{one such}} {{consequence}} of the halting problem's undecidability is that there cannot be a general algorithm that decides whether a given statement about natural numbers is true or not.

If we had an algorithm that could find the truth value of every statement about natural numbers, it <b>could</b> <b>certainly</b> find the truth value of this one; but that would determine whether the original program halts, which is impossible, since the halting problem is undecidable.|$|E

25|$|Mount Allison's origins however {{go back to}} a boys' academy {{founded in}} June 1839 by a local Methodist merchant, Charles Frederick Allison. Charles Allison's {{grandfather}} had emigrated from Ireland to Canada in the late 18th century because of the after effects of a dinner with the local government tax collector. Wanting to impress the man, the family had set the table with their one valuable possession: silver spoons. After entertaining their guest, the Allisons were informed by the tax collector that if they could afford silver spoons, then they <b>could</b> <b>certainly</b> afford to pay more taxes. The Allisons left Ireland shortly thereafter. The offending spoons are now on display in the university library.|$|E
25|$|The Nazis {{respected}} Eckenfelder's work, whose motifs {{could easily}} be interpreted {{in terms of their}} blood and soil ideology. On 9 December 1928 Eckenfelder had signed a joint election manifesto issued by the Sparerbund (Association of Savers) and the Nazi Party, although he was not a member of either organization. In Württemberg at that time, the Nazis had a stronger conservative orientation and entered into coalitions on the local level with single-issue middle-class parties. Friedrich Eckenfelder, whose monarchist worldview had been badly shaken by the Munich Soviet Republic and who was affected by the hyperinflation of the period, <b>could</b> <b>certainly</b> identify with the contents of the manifesto. As a figurehead, he headed the joint Nazi-Sparerbund candidate list, but evidently the voters did not take his candidacy seriously: he received markedly fewer votes than candidates further down the list. In 1933, as Balingen's most prominent contemporary artist, he was commissioned by the town to produce paintings as gifts for the three newest honorary citizens: Hitler, Hindenburg and Murr. The local Nazi Party headquarters commissioned him to paint a portrait of Hitler.|$|E

This whole intermezzo underlined the humoristic-burlesque element in the symphony {{in such a way that}} Carl Nielsen <b>could</b> <b>certainly</b> never have dreamed of. His representation of modern life with its confusion, brutality and struggle, all the uncontrolled shouts of pain and ignorance—and behind it all the side drum's harsh rhythm as the only disciplining force—as the public fled, made a touch of almost diabolic humour.|$|E

500|$|Some {{observers}} {{have speculated that}} if the participants were Falun Gong practitioners, they may have resorted to self-immolation {{in response to the}} publication of a new scripture by Li Hongzhi released on 1 January 2001, [...] "Beyond the Limits of Forbearance." [...] An article authored by a collection of Mainland Chinese Falun Gong practitioners and published on the main Chinese-language Falun Gong website noted that the scripture had caused confusion both among Falun Gong practitioners and [...] "in society," [...] and that some people wondered whether Falun Gong would resort to violence to resist persecution. The authors wrote that this would not occur, as violence would be both counterproductive and contrary to the teachings of the practice. A Falun Gong spokesperson clarified that the new scripture simply meant it was time to [...] "bring truth to light" [...] about human rights abuses committed by the Chinese government. Nonetheless, Gittings posited that the scripture may have confused Falun Gong followers, particularly in Mainland China. Matthew Forney wrote in Time magazine that Li's message had spread into China via the internet and informal networks of followers, and speculated that it may have galvanised more radical practitioners there. David Ownby wrote that he found the brief message to be [...] "difficult to interpret": on its surface, the scripture resembled a [...] "call to arms" [...] against what Li described as [...] "evil beings who no longer have any human nature or righteous thoughts." [...] Yet Ownby said no practitioners he talked to had seen the scripture as a [...] "green light" [...] for violent action. Instead, practitioners had interpreted it to mean that they could resist suppression without guilt; they could stop [...] "simply surrendering to the police at the first moment of a confrontation. They could run away, they could organize, they were, in a word, free of whatever constraints the necessity to [...] "forbear" [...] had previously placed upon them." [...] In an interview with the Washington Post, Ownby noted that Li does not endorse suicide in any of his recent statements, [...] "But a practitioner {{at the end of his}} or her rope in China <b>could</b> <b>certainly</b> see [...] as an endorsement for martyrdom, and perhaps choose his or her own means to achieve that." ...|$|E
