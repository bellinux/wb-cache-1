Next, the car's suspension was tested over different types of road surfaces, including German and Belgian blocks & cobblestones. Next, the car's anti-lock braking system was turned off and the car tried to navigate a course of cones, knocking many over in the process. The anti-lock brakes were then turned back on and a similar cone course was navigated easily. Guests were shown a video overlay of the difference. Then, the cars were brought through 3 environmental chambers: a heat chamber, a <b>cold</b> <b>chamber,</b> and a corrosion chamber.|$|E
500|$|By the 1570s, Sir Henry Sidney and {{his wife}} had become {{somewhat}} disillusioned and embittered about lacking financial rewards on the Queen's part for their long service. In 1572 Mary Dudley even had to decline a barony for her husband in a letter to William Cecil, himself Baron Burghley since the previous year: The expenses such a title implied were simply too great, Sir Henry's mind being [...] "dismayed [...] hard choice" [...] between choosing financial ruin and royal displeasure [...] "in refusing it". Two years later, in 1574, she quarrelled with the Lord Chamberlain (her brother-in-law, the Earl of Sussex) over accommodation at court.

2500|$|The T44 {{participated in}} a {{competitive}} service rifle competition conducted by the Infantry Board at Fort Benning, Georgia against the Springfield T47 (a modified T25) and the T48, a variant of Fabrique Nationale's FN FAL (from [...] "Fusil Automatique Leger", French for [...] "light automatic rifle"). [...] The T47, which {{did not have a}} bolt roller and performed worse in dust and cold weather tests than both the T44 and the T48, was dropped from consideration in 1953. [...] During 1952–53, testing proved the T48 and the T44 roughly comparable in performance, with the T48 holding an advantage in ease of field stripping and dust resistance, as well as a longer product development lead time. [...] A Newsweek article in July 1953 hinted that the T48/FAL might be selected over the T44. [...] During the winter of 1953–54, both rifles competed in the winter rifle trials at U.S. Army facilities in the Arctic. [...] Springfield Armory engineers, anxious to ensure the selection of the T44, had been specially preparing and modifying the test T44 rifles for weeks with the aid of the armory's <b>cold</b> <b>chamber,</b> including redesign of the T44 gas regulator and custom modifications to magazines and other parts to reduce friction and seizing in extreme cold. [...] The T48 rifles received no such special preparation, and in the continued cold weather testing began to experience sluggish gas system functioning, aggravated by the T48's close-fitting surfaces between bolt and carrier, and carrier and receiver. [...] FN engineers opened the gas ports in an attempt to improve functioning, but this caused early/violent extraction and broken parts {{as a result of the}} increased pressures. [...] As a result, the T44 was ranked superior in cold weather operation to the T48. [...] The Arctic Test Board report made it clear that the T48 needed improvement and that the U.S. would not adopt the T48 until it had successfully completed another round of Arctic tests the following winter.|$|E

60|$|Shame and {{confusion}} at once fell on me; and, laying down the paper, I beat an immediate {{retreat from the}} apartment. Neither Felipe nor his mother could have read the books nor written these rough but feeling verses. It was plain I had stumbled with sacrilegious feet into the room of {{the daughter of the}} house. God knows, my own heart most sharply punished me for my indiscretion. The thought that I had thus secretly pushed my way into the confidence of a girl so strangely situated, and the fear that she might somehow come to hear of it, oppressed me like guilt. I blamed myself besides for my suspicions of the night before; wondered that I should ever have attributed those shocking cries to one of whom I now conceived as of a saint, spectral of mien, wasted with maceration, bound up in the practices of a mechanical devotion, and dwelling in a great isolation of soul with her incongruous relatives; and as I leaned on the balustrade of the gallery and looked down into the bright close of pomegranates and at the gaily dressed and somnolent woman, who just then stretched herself and delicately licked her lips as in the very sensuality of sloth, my mind swiftly compared the scene with the <b>cold</b> <b>chamber</b> looking northward on the mountains, where the daughter dwelt.|$|E

40|$|In a 14 -week study, 1 -year-old Aleppo pine {{seedlings}} {{were grown}} in two growth chambers. Seedlings were artificially hardened by decreasing photoperiod and temperature. In each chamber {{half of the}} seedlings were fertilized with nitrogen (8. 4 mg seedling(- 1)). In {{order to determine the}} relative importance of the hardening environment versus fertilization, each chamber was programmed to decrease night temperatures down to a low of 8 or 4 degrees C. Chlorophyll fluorescence and frost hardiness was measured five times during the experiment. A sample of seedlings from each treatment was exposed to an artificial frost at - 5 degrees C and the freezing effects were assessed by measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence and visual evaluation of needle damage. Seedlings increased their frost hardiness during the experiment in all the treatments but the ratio of variable to maximal chlorophyll fluorescence (F(v) /F(m)) measured before freezing did not vary during the experiment. This indicates that Aleppo pine maintains its photosynthetic ability during hardening in contrast to other coniferous species from colder climates. The effect of nitrogen fertilization on frost hardiness was small in comparison with chamber effect. Nitrogen fertilization slightly delayed the acquisition of hardening in the <b>coldest</b> <b>chamber.</b> Seedlings in the warmest chamber did not become fully resistant to - 5 degrees C, but in the <b>coldest</b> <b>chamber,</b> where night temperature reached 4 degrees C, all the seedlings were resistant to the frost. Severe damage caused by frost could be related to a rapid rise of minimal fluorescence (F(0)) but the best index of damage was the drop of F(v) /F(m) after freezing...|$|R

5000|$|The common {{argument}} used {{to explain}} this is that, locally, entropy can be lowered by external action, e.g. solar heating action, and that this applies to machines, such as a refrigerator, where the entropy in the <b>cold</b> <b>chamber</b> is being reduced, to growing crystals, and to living organisms. [...] This local increase in order is, however, only possible {{at the expense of}} an entropy increase in the surroundings; here more disorder must be created. [...] The conditioner of this statement suffices that living systems are open systems in which both heat, mass, and or work may transfer into or out of the system. Unlike temperature, the putative entropy of a living system would drastically change if the organism were thermodynamically isolated. If an organism was in this type of “isolated” situation, its entropy would increase markedly as the once-living components of the organism decayed to an unrecognizable mass.|$|E
