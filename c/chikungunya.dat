5|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{should be}} considered in anyone who develops a fever within two weeks of being in the tropics or subtropics. It can be difficult to distinguish dengue fever and <b>chikungunya,</b> a similar viral infection that shares many symptoms and occurs in similar parts of the world to dengue. Often, investigations are performed to exclude other conditions that cause similar symptoms, such as malaria, leptospirosis, viral hemorrhagic fever, typhoid fever, meningococcal disease, measles, and influenza. Zika fever also has similar symptoms as dengue.|$|E
5|$|About 18% {{of the men}} and 30% of {{the women}} in Kolkata are obese—the {{majority}} of them belonging to the non-poor strata of society. In 2005, Kolkata had the highest percentage (55%) among the surveyed cities of anaemic woman, while 20% of the men in Kolkata were anaemic. Diseases like diabetes, asthma, goitre and other thyroid disorders were found in large numbers of people. Tropical diseases like malaria, dengue and <b>chikungunya</b> are prevalent in Kolkata, though their incidence is decreasing. Kolkata is one of the districts in India with a high number of people with AIDS; it has been designated a district prone to high risk.|$|E
25|$|The Asian tiger {{mosquito}} {{was responsible for}} the <b>Chikungunya</b> epidemic on the French Island La Réunion in 2005–2006. By September 2006, an estimated 266,000 people were infected with the virus, and 248 fatalities occurred on the island. The Asian {{tiger mosquito}} was also the transmitter of the virus in the first and only outbreak of <b>Chikungunya</b> fever on the European continent. This outbreak occurred in the Italian province of Ravenna in the summer of 2007, and infected over 200 people. Evidently, mutated strains of the <b>Chikungunya</b> virus are being directly transmitted through Ae. albopictus particularly well and {{in such a way that}} another dispersal of the disease in regions with the Asian tiger mosquito is feared.|$|E
25|$|The {{incubation}} {{period of the}} <b>chikungunya</b> virus ranges from one to twelve days, and is most typically three to seven.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chikungunya</b> is an {{infection}} {{caused by the}} <b>chikungunya</b> virus (CHIKV). Symptoms include fever and joint pain. These typically occur two to twelve days after exposure. Other symptoms may include headache, muscle pain, joint swelling, and a rash. Most people are better within a week; however, occasionally the joint pain may last for months. The risk of death is around 1 in 1,000. The very young, old, and those with other health problems {{are at risk of}} more severe disease.|$|E
25|$|Ae. albopictus {{is known}} to {{transmit}} pathogens and viruses, such as the yellow fever virus, dengue fever, <b>Chikungunya</b> fever, and Usutu virus. There is some evidence supporting the role of Ae. albopictus in the transmission of Zika virus.|$|E
25|$|Biosafety level 3 is {{commonly}} used for research and diagnostic work involving various microbes which can be transmitted by aerosols and/or cause severe disease. These include Francisella tularensis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Chlamydia psittaci, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Eastern equine encephalitis virus, SARS coronavirus, Coxiella burnetii, Rift Valley fever virus, Rickettsia rickettsii, several species of Brucella, <b>chikungunya,</b> yellow fever virus, and West Nile virus.|$|E
25|$|Control of {{the yellow}} fever {{mosquito}} A. aegypti is of major importance, especially because the same mosquito can also transmit dengue fever and <b>chikungunya</b> disease. A. aegypti breeds preferentially in water, for example in installations by inhabitants of areas with precarious drinking water supply, or in domestic waste, especially tires, cans, and plastic bottles. These conditions are common in urban areas in developing countries.|$|E
25|$|Anguilla's {{selected}} rivals for the qualifiers of the 2014 Caribbean Cup (qualifying {{tournament for}} the 2014 Gold Cup) were Jamaica, Dominican Republic and Saint Lucia in the Group 5. Anguilla withdrew {{before the start}} of the competition due to the outbreak of <b>Chikungunya</b> virus. This means that Anguilla's last match to the date was on 30 March 2010 against Grenada for the 2010 qualifiers.|$|E
25|$|Viral diseases, such as yellow fever, dengue fever, and <b>chikungunya,</b> {{transmitted}} {{mostly by}} Aedes aegypti. Dengue fever {{is the most}} common cause of fever in travelers returning from the Caribbean, Central America, South America, and South Central Asia. This disease is spread through the bites of infected mosquitoes and cannot be spread person to person. Severe dengue can be fatal, but with good treatment, fewer than 1% of patients die from dengue.|$|E
25|$|Medical {{shortages}} {{in the country}} hampered the medical treatment of Venezuelans. Shortages of antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV/AIDS affected about 50,000 Venezuelans, potentially causing thousands of Venezuelans with HIV to develop AIDS. Venezuelans also stated that due to shortages of medicines, {{it was hard to}} find acetaminophen to help alleviate the newly introduced <b>chikungunya</b> virus, a potentially lethal mosquito-borne disease. Diphtheria, which had been eradicated from Venezuela in the 1990s, reappeared in 2016 due to the shortages of medicine.|$|E
25|$|Most {{people who}} are {{infected}} have no or few symptoms. Otherwise the most common {{signs and symptoms of}} Zika fever are fever, rash, conjunctivitis (red eyes), muscle and joint pain, and headache, which are similar to signs and symptoms of dengue and <b>chikungunya</b> fever. The time from a mosquito bite to developing symptoms is not yet known, but is probably a few days to a week. The disease lasts for several days to a week and is usually mild enough that people do not {{have to go to a}} hospital.|$|E
25|$|This {{mosquito}} {{has become}} a significant pest in many communities because it closely associates with humans (rather than living in wetlands), and typically flies and feeds in the daytime in addition to at dusk and dawn. The insect is called a tiger mosquito for its striped appearance, which resembles that of the tiger. Ae. albopictus is an epidemiologically important vector for the transmission of many viral pathogens, including the yellow fever virus, dengue fever, and <b>Chikungunya</b> fever, {{as well as several}} filarial nematodes such as Dirofilaria immitis. Aedes albopictus is capable of hosting the Zika virus and is considered a potential vector for Zika transmission among humans.|$|E

2500|$|Three epidemiologically {{different}} infectious cycles occur, {{in which}} the virus is transmitted from mosquitoes to humans or other primates. In the [...] "urban cycle", only the yellow fever mosquito A. aegypti is involved. It is well adapted to urban areas and can also transmit other diseases, including Zika fever, dengue fever, and <b>chikungunya.</b> The urban cycle {{is responsible for the}} major outbreaks of yellow fever that occur in Africa. Except in an outbreak in 1999 in Bolivia, this urban cycle no longer exists in South America.|$|E
2500|$|Dengue virus (DENV) is {{the cause}} of dengue fever. It is a mosquito-borne single positive-stranded RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae; genus Flavivirus. [...] Five serotypes of the virus have been found, all of which can cause the full {{spectrum}} of disease. Nevertheless, scientists are finding their understanding of dengue virus may be simplistic, as rather than distinct antigenic groups {{there appears to be a}} continuum. [...] This same study identified 47 strains of dengue virus. [...] Additionally, coinfection with and lack of rapid tests for zika virus and <b>chikungunya</b> complicate matters in real world infections.|$|E
2500|$|Mosquitoes are small, midge-like flies that {{constitute}} the family Culicidae. Females of most species are ectoparasites, whose tube-like mouthparts (called a proboscis) pierce the hosts' skin to consume blood. The word [...] "mosquito" [...] (formed by mosca and diminutive -ito) is Spanish for [...] "little fly". [...] Thousands of species feed on the blood of various kinds of hosts, mainly vertebrates, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and even some kinds of fish. Some mosquitoes also attack invertebrates, mainly other arthropods. Though the loss of blood is seldom of any importance to the victim, the saliva of the mosquito often causes an irritating rash that is a serious nuisance. Much more serious though, are the roles of many species of mosquitoes as vectors of diseases. In passing from host to host, some transmit extremely harmful infections such as malaria, yellow fever, <b>Chikungunya,</b> West Nile virus, dengue fever, filariasis, Zika virus and other arboviruses, rendering it the deadliest animal family in the world.|$|E

50|$|The <b>chikungunya</b> {{virus is}} passed to humans when a bite from an {{infected}} mosquito breaks {{the skin and}} introduces the virus into the body.The pathogenesis of <b>chikungunya</b> infection in humans is still poorly understood, despite recent outbreaks. It appears that in vitro, <b>chikungunya</b> virus is able to replicate in human epithelial and endothelial cells, primary fibroblasts, and monocyte-derived macrophages. Viral replication is highly cytopathic, but susceptible to type-I and -II interferon. In vivo, in studies using living cells, <b>chikungunya</b> virus appears to replicate in fibroblasts, skeletal muscle progenitor cells, and myofibers.|$|E

5000|$|Global {{rates of}} <b>chikungunya</b> {{infection}} are variable, depending on outbreaks. When <b>chikungunya</b> was first identified in 1952, {{it had a}} low-level circulation in West Africa, with infection rates linked to rainfall. Beginning in the 1960s, periodic outbreaks were documented in Asia and Africa. However, since 2005, following several decades of relative inactivity, <b>chikungunya</b> has re-emerged and caused large outbreaks in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. In India, for instance, <b>chikungunya</b> re-appeared following 32 years of absence of viral activity. Outbreaks have occurred in Europe, the Caribbean, and South America, areas in which <b>chikungunya</b> was not previously transmitted. Local transmission has also occurred in the United States and Australia, countries in which the virus was previously unknown. In 2005, an outbreak {{on the island of}} Réunion was the largest then documented, with an estimated 266,000 cases on an island with a population of approximately 770,000. In a 2006 outbreak, India reported 1.25 million suspected cases. [...] <b>Chikungunya</b> was recently introduced to the Americas, and from 2013-14 in the Americas, 1,118,763 suspected cases and 24,682 confirmed cases were reported by the PAHO.|$|E
50|$|On October 20, 2014, 11 locally {{acquired}} {{cases of}} <b>chikungunya</b> {{were reported in}} Montpellier, Languedoc-Roussillon, in the South of France. 449 imported cases of <b>chikungunya</b> were also reported throughout France during the period May-November 2014.|$|E
50|$|Passive {{immunotherapy}} {{has potential}} benefit in treatment of <b>chikungunya.</b> Studies in animals using passive immunotherapy have been effective, and clinical studies using passive immunotherapy in those {{particularly vulnerable to}} severe infection are currently in progress. Passive immunotherapy involves administration of anti-CHIKV hyperimmune human intravenous antibodies (immunoglobulins) to those exposed to {{a high risk of}} <b>chikungunya</b> infection. No antiviral treatment for <b>chikungunya</b> virus is currently available, though testing has shown several medications to be effective in vitro.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chikungunya</b> {{is spread}} through bites from Aedes mosquitoes, and the species A. aegypti was {{identified}} as the most common vector, though the virus has recently been associated with many other species, including A. albopictus. Research by the Pasteur Institute in Paris has suggested <b>chikungunya</b> virus strains in the 2005-2006 Reunion Island outbreak incurred a mutation that facilitated transmission by the Asian tiger mosquito (A. albopictus). Other species potentially able to transmit the <b>chikungunya</b> virus include Ae. furcifer-taylori, Ae. africanus, and Ae. luteocephalus.|$|E
50|$|Yellow fever, <b>chikungunya,</b> Zika, Bouboui and Bunyamwera viruses {{have been}} {{isolated}} {{from members of}} the furcifer group. Ae. furcifer is involved in monkey-to-man and man-to-man transmission of yellow fever, is a potential vector of dengue virus serotype 2, and is a vector of <b>chikungunya</b> virus.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chikungunya</b> is {{diagnosed}} {{on the basis}} of clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory criteria. Clinically, acute onset of high fever and severe joint pain would lead to suspicion of <b>chikungunya.</b> Epidemiological criteria consist of whether the individual has traveled to or spent time in an area in which <b>chikungunya</b> is present within the last twelve days (i.e. the potential incubation period). Laboratory criteria include a decreased lymphocyte count consistent with viremia. However a definitive laboratory diagnosis can be accomplished through viral isolation, RT-PCR, or serological diagnosis.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Chikungunya</b> is an arboviral disease {{transmitted}} by A. albopictus and A. aegypti mosquitoes. The virus was first isolated from an outbreak in Tanzania in 1952. <b>Chikungunya</b> virus {{is a member}} of the genus Alphavirus and family Togaviridae. The word <b>chikungunya</b> is from the Makonde which means [...] "that which bends up," [...] and this refers to the effect of the debilitating joint pain on the patient. The symptoms can be confused with dengue and include fever, rash, joint pain, and swelling. The disease mainly occurs in Africa and Asia.|$|E
5000|$|In late 2014, Venezuelans began {{saying that}} due to {{shortages}} of medicines, {{it was hard to}} find acetaminophen to help alleviate the newly introduced <b>chikungunya</b> virus, a potentially lethal mosquito-borne disease. In September 2014, the Venezuelan government stated that only 400 Venezuelans were infected with <b>chikungunya</b> while the Central University of Venezuela stated that there could be between 65,000 and 117,000 Venezuelans infected. In August 2015 independent health monitors said that there were more than two million people infected with <b>chikungunya</b> while the government said there were 36,000 cases.|$|E
50|$|Rarely, {{neurological}} disorders {{have been reported}} in association with <b>chikungunya</b> virus, including Guillain-Barré syndrome, palsies, meningoencephalitis, flaccid paralysis and neuropathy. In contrast to dengue fever, <b>Chikungunya</b> fever very rarely causes hemorrhagic complications. Symptoms of bleeding should lead to consideration of alternative diagnoses or co-infection with dengue fever or coexisting congestive hepatopathy.|$|E
50|$|Observations {{during recent}} {{epidemics}} have suggested <b>chikungunya</b> may cause long-term symptoms following acute infection. This condition has been termed chronic <b>chikungunya</b> virus-induced arthralgia. Long-term symptoms {{are not an}} entirely new observation; long-term arthritis was observed following an outbreak in 1979. Common predictors of prolonged symptoms are advanced age and prior rheumatological disease.|$|E
50|$|The type-1 {{interferon}} response {{seems to}} play an important role in the host's response to <b>chikungunya</b> infection. Upon infection with <b>chikungunya,</b> the host's fibroblasts produce type-1 alpha and beta interferon (IFN-α and IFN-β). In mouse studies, deficiencies in INF-1 in mice exposed to the virus cause increased morbidity and mortality. The chikungunya-specific upstream components of the type-1 interferon pathway involved in the host's response to <b>chikungunya</b> infection are still unknown. Nonetheless, mouse studies suggest that IPS-1 is an important factor, and that IRF3 and IRF7 are important in an age-dependent manner. Mouse studies also suggest that <b>chikungunya</b> evades host defenses and counters the type-I interferon response by producing NS2, a nonstructural protein that degrades RBP1 and turns off the host cell's ability to transcribe DNA. NS2 interferes with the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and prevents STAT from becoming phosphorylated.|$|E
50|$|Due to pollution, mainly {{resulting}} from garbage dumps and overflow of sewerage water, Emergency declared in Malir Town, {{as thousands of}} patients were affected by mysterious <b>Chikungunya</b> virus in December, 2016.

5000|$|Improved {{sanitation}} {{and water}} management {{can contribute to}} reduce proliferation of mosquitoes that transmit diseases, such as lymphatic filariasis, dengue and <b>chikungunya.</b> Breeding of the Culex mosquito which transmits filarial parasites is facilitated through poorly constructed latrines. Breeding of the Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes which transmit dengue and <b>chikungunya</b> can be prevented through safe storage of water.|$|E
