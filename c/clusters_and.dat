In this paper, we propose to perform simultaneous face <b>clustering</b> <b>and</b> face tracking from real world videos. The motivation for the proposed research is that face <b>clustering</b> <b>and</b> face tracking can provide useful information and constraints to each other, thus can bootstrap and improve the performances of each other. To this end, we introduce a Coupled Hidden Markov Random Field (CHMRF) to simultaneously model face <b>clustering,</b> face tracking, <b>and</b> their interactions. We provide an effective algorithm based on constrained <b>clustering</b> <b>and</b> optimal tracking for the joint optimization of <b>cluster</b> labels <b>and</b> face tracking.

40|$|An {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to ascertain the}} extent of genetic diversity present among 90 pigeonpea genotypes using D 2 statistic. Cluster analysis grouped 90 germplasm into six clusters based {{on the degree of}} divergence between the genotypes. Clustering pattern revealed non parallelism between genetic diversity and geographic distribution. Inter cluster distance was least between <b>cluster</b> II <b>and</b> <b>cluster</b> III <b>and</b> <b>cluster</b> I <b>and</b> VI, indicating less divergence in these four clusters. Maximum inter cluster distance was noticed between the <b>cluster</b> V <b>and</b> <b>cluster</b> VI, <b>cluster</b> IV <b>and</b> <b>cluster</b> VI, <b>cluster</b> II <b>and</b> <b>cluster</b> VI <b>and</b> <b>cluster</b> I <b>and</b> <b>cluster</b> V, indicating more divergence of <b>cluster</b> V <b>and</b> this <b>cluster</b> had five genotypes viz.,C - 2291, ICP 7234, ICP 12225, AL 1741, ICP 2391.

5|$|Classical Nahuatl {{and most}} of the modern {{varieties}} have fairly simple phonological systems. They allow only syllables with maximally one initial and one final consonant. Consonant clusters occur only word-medially and over syllable boundaries. Some morphemes have two alternating forms: one with a vowel i to prevent consonant <b>clusters</b> <b>and</b> one without it. For example, the absolutive suffix has the variant forms -tli (used after consonants) and -tl (used after vowels). Some modern varieties, however, have formed complex clusters from vowel loss. Others have contracted syllable sequences, causing accents to shift or vowels to become long.|$|E
5|$|Galerina marginata is a {{saprobic}} fungus, obtaining nutrients {{by breaking}} down organic matter.

30|$|We have {{identified}} some issues of ACDA regarding the message passing and network performance. The ACDA uses random waiting time in selecting the <b>cluster</b> head <b>and</b> gateway. Using this random waiting time, {{a number of}} messages need to be sent in the network. Besides, the authors of [28] do not consider the residual energy for selecting the <b>cluster</b> head <b>and</b> gateway. In renewing of the <b>cluster</b> head <b>and</b> gateway, the <b>cluster</b> members select their waiting time and start passing messages. Besides, the number of messages passing in the <b>cluster</b> <b>and</b> gateway selection phase and renewing of the <b>cluster</b> <b>and</b> gateway cost a huge energy of the limited battery power of the sensor nodes. However, we provide a better algorithm which will consider the residual energy of the sensor and distance from the sink to calculate the <b>cluster</b> head <b>and</b> gateway in directional sensor networks. Moreover, in our renewing of the <b>cluster</b> <b>and</b> gateway process, the existing cluster head will calculate the priority from the <b>cluster</b> members <b>and</b> select the new <b>cluster</b> head <b>and</b> gateway which will minimize the number of messages passing compared to the autonomous cluster algorithm.|$|R

5|$|In Five Songs (1956–57) and Musique funèbre (1958) Lutosławski {{introduced}} his {{own brand of}} twelve-tone music, marking his departure from the explicit use of folk music. His twelve-tone technique allowed him to build harmony and melody from specific intervals (in Musique funèbre, augmented fourths and semitones). This system also gave him the means to write dense chords without resorting to tone <b>clusters,</b> <b>and</b> enabled him to build towards these dense chords (which often include all twelve notes of the chromatic scale) at climactic moments. Lutosławski's twelve-note techniques were thus completely different in conception from Arnold Schoenberg's tone-row system, although Musique funèbre does happen {{to be based on}} a tone row.
