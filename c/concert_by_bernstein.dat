25|$|The {{overture}} to Candide soon {{earned a}} place in the orchestral repertoire. After a successful first concert performance on January 26, 1957, by the New York Philharmonic under the composer's baton, it quickly became popular and was performed by nearly 100 other orchestras within the next two years. Since that time, it {{has become one of the}} most frequently performed orchestral compositions by a 20th century American composer; in 1987, it was the most often performed piece of <b>concert</b> music <b>by</b> <b>Bernstein.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Some {{years later}} the work was being {{assessed}} for performance at Emanu-El and was submitted for examination by several musicians including Leonard Bernstein, who noted it to be [...] "a fine compromise between tradition and somewhat contemporary sounds." [...] Subsequently, Berlinski orchestrated and expanded the work for a <b>concert</b> performance conducted <b>by</b> <b>Bernstein</b> at New York's Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in 1963.|$|R
50|$|CBS {{was also}} {{responsible}} for airing the series of Young People's <b>Concerts</b> conducted <b>by</b> Leonard <b>Bernstein.</b> Telecast every few months between 1958 and 1972, first in black-and-white and then broadcast in color beginning in 1966, these programs introduced millions of children to classical music through the eloquent commentaries <b>by</b> Maestro <b>Bernstein.</b> The specials were nominated for several Emmy Awards including two wins in 1961 an later in 1966, and {{were among the first}} programs ever broadcast from Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts.|$|R
50|$|Marc Blitzstein {{adapted the}} story as a {{libretto}} for a one-act opera, the music for which he began but completed only a scene and a song. Said song was premiered at the 1964 Marc Blitzstein Memorial <b>Concert</b> conducted <b>by</b> Leonard <b>Bernstein</b> and recorded on Koch by William Sharp. A performance of it by Erin Passmore, introduced and accompanied by Leonard Lehrman at the 2012 Halifax Summer Opera Workshop, was videotaped and posted on YouTube.|$|R
5000|$|His major {{teachers}} include Herman Reinshagen and Stuart Sankey, {{with whom}} he studied at the Aspen Music Festival and the Juilliard School. Karr's breakthrough came in 1962, when he was featured as a soloist in a nationally televised New York Philharmonic Young People's <b>Concert,</b> conducted <b>by</b> Leonard <b>Bernstein.</b> On that famous telecast, Karr performed [...] "The Swan" [...] from The Carnival of the Animals by Camille Saint-Saëns. Karr also recorded the piece with Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the work}} was {{composed}} during Ives's 20s, it was half a century before it was premiered, in 1951, in a New York Philharmonic <b>concert</b> conducted <b>by</b> Leonard <b>Bernstein.</b> The symphony was premiered to rapturous applause but Ives responded with ambivalence (he reportedly spat)—he {{did not attend the}} concert in person, but listened to a radio broadcast. The public performance had been postponed for so long because Ives had been alienated from the American classical establishment. Ever since his training with Horatio Parker at Yale, Ives had suffered their disapproval of the mischievous unorthodoxy with which he pushed the boundaries of European classical structures to create soundscapes that recalled the vernacular music-making of his New England upbringing.|$|R
25|$|At a young age, Ma began {{studying}} violin and piano and later viola, finally settling on the cello in 1960 at age four. According to Ma, his first choice was the double bass {{due to its}} large size, but he compromised and took up cello instead. The child prodigy began performing before audiences at age five and performed for Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy when he was seven. At age eight, he appeared on American television with his sister, Yeou-Cheng Ma, in a <b>concert</b> conducted <b>by</b> Leonard <b>Bernstein.</b> In 1964, Isaac Stern introduced them on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, and they performed the Sonata of Sammartini. He attended Trinity School in New York but transferred to the Professional Children's School, from which he graduated at age 15. He appeared as a soloist with the Harvard Radcliffe Orchestra in a performance of the Tchaikovsky Rococo Variations.|$|R
5000|$|He made an {{appearance}} on The Colgate Comedy Hour and on a program called TV Recital Hall in 1951, {{the same year that}} he made his screen debut in Show Boat. He later appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1955. In 1961, he appeared as a recital soloist on an episode of the Young People's <b>Concerts,</b> conducted <b>by</b> Leonard <b>Bernstein.</b> In March 1984 he was the winner of a Grammy in the [...] "Spoken Word" [...] category for his outstanding narration of Aaron Copland's Lincoln Portrait accompanied by the Eastman Philharmonia http://www.esm.rochester.edu/tag/eastman-philharmonia/. And in the 1990s, he narrated a special jazz arrangement of music from [...] "Show Boat", on the PRI program Riverwalk Jazz. In 1999 Warfield joined baritones Robert Sims and Benjamin Matthews in a trio by the name of [...] "Three Generations". Managed by Arthur White, this ensemble toured the United States giving full concerts of African-American spirituals and folk songs until Warfield's death in 2002.|$|R
5000|$|Over the years, Beethoven's [...] "Ode to Joy" [...] has {{remained}} a protest anthem and a celebration of music. From demonstrators in Chile singing during demonstration against the Pinochet dictatorship, Chinese student broadcast at Tiananmen Square, the <b>concert</b> conducted <b>by</b> Leonard <b>Bernstein</b> {{after the fall of}} the Berlin Wall and Daiku (Big Ninth) concerts in Japan every December and one after the 2011 tsunami. It has recently inspired flashmob performances at public spaces by musicians in many countries worldwide, including Choir Without Borders's 2009 performance at a train station in Leipzig, Germany, to mark the 20th and 25th anniversary of the Fall of the Berlin Wall, Hong Kong Festival Orchestra's 2013 performance at a Hong Kong mall, and performance in Sabadell, Spain. A 2013 documentary, Following the Ninth, directed by Kerry Candaele, follows its continuing popularity. It was played after Emmanuel Macron's victory in the 2017 French Presidential elections, when Macron gave his victory speech at the Louvre. Pianist Igor Levit played the piece at the Royal Albert Hall during the 2017 Proms.|$|R
40|$|The {{fact that}} Beethoven’s Ninth was {{performed}} at Tiananmen Square, China and Berlin, Germany in 1989 demonstrates the symphony’s potential for communicating across differences {{of time and}} culture. By closely examining the first seventeen measures of Ludwig van Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9 in D Minor, Op. 125, first movement “Allegro ma non troppo un poco maestoso” {{as well as the}} student protests in Tiananmen Square, China and the Christmas Day celebration <b>concert</b> led <b>by</b> Leonard <b>Bernstein</b> in Berlin, Germany in 1989, this paper argues that the enduring significance of the Ninth Symphony is possible because of the penetrating themes of brotherhood, creation, and freedom. Ludwig van Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9 is still a work that speaks to contemporary political events where the themes of brotherhood, creation, and freedom are present within the political movements. When Beethoven composed this work in the early nineteenth century, he may have been able to recognize the uniqueness of the work since {{this was the first time}} a choir was called for in a symphonic score. The uniqueness and grandeur of this work endures today as Symphony No. 9 continues to be regularly performed around the world, proclaiming its themes of brotherhood, creation, and freedom...|$|R
