40|$|The market’s {{interest}} in aromatic plants is growing dramatically, in particular for oregano, {{one of the}} most popular, which is traditionally used for many food preparations. Yet, great confusion about the correct taxonomic classification of oregano still remains due to the many species marketed under this name. Most species, collected or cultivated to produce oregano, are characterised by a composition of essential oils rich in carvacrol, the component to which the <b>characteristic</b> <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> <b>aroma</b> of this spice is attributable.

40|$|Sherry wine has <b>characteristic</b> <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> <b>aroma,</b> {{different}} from other wine-based alcoholic beverages. This paper reports {{a study of the}} non-volatile, low-molecular weight compounds found in sherry and related alcoholic beverages that may contribute to taste. Compounds analysed included free amino acids, organic acids, sugars and small peptides (linear and cyclic). A series of seven diketopiperazines (cyclic dipeptides) namely, cyclo(Leu-Leu), cyclo(Pro-Leu), cyclo(Pro-Ile), cyclo(Pro-Met), cyclo(Pro-Val), cyclo(Pro-Pro) and cyclo(Val-Ala) were identified {{for the first time in}} sherry. Although traces were found in some other alcoholic beverages, levels were low compared with sherry. The base wine used in the sherry production had only traces of diketopiperazines, indicating that the casking stage of sherry production might be responsible for their formation...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Nutrition)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. Interest {{has grown}} {{over the last}} two decades in the health {{benefits}} of polyphenols, with particular relation to degenerative diseases. The Kei apple (Dovyalis caffra) is an indigenous plant to South Africa, thought to be rich in polyphenols. This study aimed to produce a functional beverage from the Kei apple, with demonstrable nutritional benefits, which should also be found acceptable by consumers due to its sensory attributes. A long term aim of the study is to assist in improving income of farmers in rural and urban areas by encouraging the participation of small holders in growing the Kei apple for subsequent economic benefit. A thorough literature review was conducted on functional foods, trends for beverages, legislation and on polyphenols as a class of functional ingredients, specifically focusing on fruits and the fate of polyphenols in the body. A review of fruit processing procedures, preservation techniques and legislation, followed by new product development (NPD) and the types of consumers desiring functional foods were investigated as well as the role of sensory evaluation and consumer research were examined. Methods Kei apples were collected from two areas of South Africa, namely Bloemhof in the North West Province in the 200212003 growing season and from the Eastern and Western Cape in the 200412005 growing season. The first set of Kei apples were used to produce a prototype functional beverage, from which future development would take place. The second set of Kei apples were used for pulping on an industrial scale and then a small-scale commercial production batch of the Kei apple beverages for consumer panel testing was produced. Various flavours were used to mask the strong <b>characteristic</b> <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> <b>aroma</b> of the Kei apple for the beverage and these were narrowed down to apple, vanilla and mint 8. vanilla. Consumer panel testing was undertaken with 152 consumers with a pre-tested questionnaire using hedonic scales for overall acceptance, ranking for preference, a Fwd Action Rating Scale (FACT) for consumption intent, and a ranking test for purchase intent. All evaluations were carried out under strictly controlled sensory evaluation requirement and respondents were asked to fill in anonymous questionnaires at North West University, Potchefstroom Campus. Results and Discussion Statistical analysis of the results were determined by the Statistic* programme, version 7. In summary for all of the consumer testing, it was found that consumers regarded the apple flavoured Kei apple beverage statistically significantly more acceptable than the other flavours. The apple flavoured beverage was found to be rated practically significantly higher for the attributes of taste and overall acceptance, as well as for consumption intent, purchase intent and preference. There was, however, no significant differences in any of the attributes or evaluated consumption and purchase intent between the vanilla and mint & vanilla. The total polyphenols, determined by UV spectrophotometry as gallic acid equivalents per litre (GAE/I), were found to be slightly less then expected, with the apple and mint & vanilla showing similar results (as GAEII) 101. 7 versus 106. 1 for the latter two, whilst vanilla was 143. 0 which may have been attributed to the vanillic acid molecule itself which also has a phenolic structure. This lower-than-expected level of total polyphenols may have been due to degradation during processing. There was a clear difference in the polyphenol content between the different harvests from the two regions. The former showed greater acidity as determined by total citric acid 4. 81 % w/w and sugar 16. 3 % versus 2. 54 % w/w and 8. 4 % This may be due to various factors of climate, soil and ripeness. For comparison purposes, a commercial product from the USA, Ocean Spray ® Cranberry, was also found to have more polyphenols present than the Kei apple beverage. This was also demonstrated by the amount of ascorbic acid, free and bound. The Kei apple beverage subjected to pasteurization probably lost most of its vitamin C content due to the heat treatment and the exposure to oxygen during pulping. Conclusion and Recommendations The development of a functional beverage from the Kei apple is feasible. As with most new product developments, further formulation modifications which are not insurmountable are required. The consumer panel was positive towards the apple flavoured beverage and this flavour should be taken forward for future development. The key stumbling block to the success of this project is the lack of an effective organizing body that could liaise with the growers to form a cooperative and provide a consistent supply of Kei apples. The effect of variations in harvesting time, soil conditions and climate must also be evaluated. The improvement of income of farmers may only be achieved by the involvement of other stake holders and the formation of a Kei apple grower's co-operativeMaster...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Fruits and {{vegetables}} are important sources of vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber, and antioxidants. The relative contribution of each commodity to human health and wellness depends upon its nutritive value and per capita consumption; the latter is greatly influenced by consumer preferences and degree of satisfaction from eating the fruit or vegetable. Flavor quality of fruits {{and vegetables}} is influenced by genetic, preharvest, harvesting, and postharvest factors. The longer the time between harvest and eating, the greater the losses of <b>characteristic</b> flavor (<b>taste</b> <b>and</b> <b>aroma)</b> <b>and</b> the development of off-flavors in most fruits and vegetables. Postharvest life based on flavor and nutritional quality is shorter than that based on appearance and textural quality. Thus, it is essential that good flavor quality be emphasized in the future by selecting the best-tasting genotypes to produce, by using an integrated crop management system and harvesting at the maturity or ripeness stage that will optimize eating quality at the time of consumption, and by using the postharvest handling procedures that will maintain optimal flavor and nutritional quality {{of fruits and vegetables}} between harvest and consumption...|$|R

The whole fruit pulp and formulated bouillon cubes {{were subjected to}} an analysis of the total phenolic compounds, protein, lipid, moisture, ash, fibre, total carbohydrate and total energy values. The selected formulations of souari nut bouillon cubes were subjected to a sensory analysis as seasoning for rice preparations, and the physicochemical analysis of the most widely preferred formulation was carried out. The whole souari nut pulp was found to contain 44. 4 % moisture, 37. 7 % lipids, 2. 1 % protein and 10. 9 % total carbohydrates, as well as 324 mg of total phenolic compounds per 100 g of pulp. The souari flour contained 9. 8 % moisture. In the sensory tests, the preferred formulation was that containing the highest souari nut flour concentration. This formulation contained 8. 4 % moisture, 52. 3 % lipids, 3. 1 % protein, 19. 4 % total carbohydrate, 321 mg of phenolic compounds per 100 g and a total energy value of 560. 7 kcal per 100 g.

40|$|Cheese {{ripening}} {{involves a}} complex series of biochemical events {{that leads to}} the <b>characteristics</b> <b>taste,</b> <b>aroma</b> <b>and</b> texture of each cheese variety. The most complex of these biochemical events, proteolysis, is caused by milk, milk-clotting, starter and secondary flora enzymes. During cheese ripening, peptides generation mainly results from caseinolysis. Some of these peptides are bioactive: they exert biological activities such as immunomodulatory, antithrombotic and antibacterial activities. Asiago is a “Protected Denomination of Origin” (PDO) cheese of the North-Eastern region of Italy produced in two different varieties according to the length of ripening. Asiago d’Allevo is the variety produced with skimmed raw milk and ripened for periods varying from 6 to 18 months. The main goal of this research was to evaluate the presence of antibacterial peptides in Asiago d’Allevo cheese toward two bacterial strains. The samples analysed were produced in alpine farms of Asiago plateau (Vicenza, Italy). The presence of antimicrobial peptides was assessed in water-soluble extracts (WSE) of Asiago cheese ultrafiltrated onto 10 kDa cut-off membranes to remove proteins and dialysed in 100 Da cutoff dialysis bags to remove salt and organic acids. The antimicrobial activity of these WSEs was tested on Listeria innocua first. The samples that presented an inhibition were subsequently tested on Listeria monocytogenes. Antimicrobial activity was assayed by a micro-method using 96 -well microplates and a microplate reader to determine microbial growth inhibition...|$|R

40|$|Fish {{are one of}} {{the main}} food sources {{throughout}} the planet and, {{in some parts of the}} world, especially in developing countries they are the only source of animal protein of local residents. Since the beginning of human civilization, fish have been caught in fresh and salt waters. Despite the fact that global fish consumption has been constantly increasing and it currently accounts for almost 20 kg of fish per person per year, the situation in the Czech Republic has been changing only slowly. The Czech Republic is known for traditional fish production in pond aquaculture with long historical roots and is currently ranked 6 th within the European Union. However, fish consumption is generally one of the lowest in Europe. The annual consumption is only 5. 5 kg of fish per person per year, of which fish from domestic aquaculture amount to only 1 - 1. 5 kg. Despite the fact that fish consumption in the Czech Republic has been low in the long run, the interest of consumers has been shifting to more expensive and better quality food. They are commodities such as Atlantic salmon, tuna and crustaceans which lack typical characteristics of products from the Czech aquaculture, i. e. the <b>characteristic</b> <b>taste,</b> <b>aroma</b> <b>and</b> presence of muscle bones. These changes in consumer´s behaviour were recorded on the basis of a study focusing on the import of fishery and aquaculture products into the Czech Republic. One of the goals of this doctoral thesis were the applied results in the form of newly developed products using fish meat, less valuable parts of fish (tailpiece) and wastes from fish processing (skin, head). Due to the nature of these applied results, their registration was done in the form of utility models with the Industrial Property Office of the Czech Republic. One of the newly developed and successfully offered products on the market is carp pâté. It is made of machine-separated carp meat and contains 90 % of the meat in the product. In addition to the basic pâté, there are currently other four variants (with pepper, smoked fish, almonds and cranberries). From the above, it is clear that there are many possibilities and opportunities how to increase the consumption and use of fish from domestic aquaculture. When introducing new products from fish, which are bred in ponds, the marketing must also be used to promote their indisputable benefits. And this is mainly the fact that it is a healthy and quality domestic raw material from the Czech agriculture. The very high quality and minimal occurrence of foreign substances in products from the Czech aquaculture were confirmed by our study. In the framework of this thesis, the screening of various fishery and aquaculture products, commercially available within the Czech Republic, was carried out with regard to the occurrence of heavy metals. The results of this study showed a very good quality of these products with a low content of heavy metals. Measured values of these elements in products from the Czech aquaculture were well below the allowed limit and their consumption does not pose any health risks. Due to the nature of the obtained data, it is possible to process and publish this study in a popular-scientific form to the general public. The right form of communication and contact with the public will be a key factor in the future in introducing new aquaculture products and increasing fish consumption in the Czech Republic...|$|R
