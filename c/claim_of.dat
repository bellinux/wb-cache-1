40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the relationship between <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> near-death experiences (NDEs) and measures of self-actualization. Gestalt resistance processes transfluence, mystical experiences, and <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> peak life experiences {{in a sample of}} 155 individuals. As hypothesized, I found significant positive correlations between the <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> NDEs and transfluence and mystical experiences. I found no significant correlations between <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> NDEs and the seven Gestalt resistances, suggesting that NDErs are neither more nor less resistant than nonNDErs. I also found no significant relationship between <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> NDEs and self-actualization or <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> peak life experiences...|$|R

50|$|In {{the other}} area of {{political}} ethics, {{the key issues}} are not the conflict between means and ends but the conflicts among the ends themselves.

5|$|A common <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> creationists is that {{evolution}} {{has never been}} observed. Challenges to such objections often come down to debates over how evolution is defined (see the Defining evolution section above). Under the conventional biological definition of evolution, {{it is a simple}} matter to observe evolution occurring. Evolutionary processes, in the form of populations changing their genetic composition from generation to generation, have been observed in different scientific contexts, including the evolution of fruit flies, mice, and bacteria in the laboratory, and of tilapia in the field. Such studies on experimental evolution, particularly those using microorganisms, are now providing important insights into how evolution occurs, {{especially in the case of}} antibiotic resistance.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} culinary and medical {{advances}} {{have been developed}} in Oldham. There are claims that Oldham was {{the birthplace of the}} first chip shop.

In 1900 Oldham had the highest concentration of chip shops in the country, one for every 400 people. Rag Pudding is a savoury dish said to be native to Oldham. Yates Wine Lodge was founded in Oldham by Peter and Simon Yates in 1884.|$|E
5|$|A {{petition}} {{was filed}} by King David Kalakaua and his sisters and brother-in-law, Lydia K. Dominis, Miriam K.

While the Justices {{felt that the}} <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> Kalakaua and his sisters had not been proven, they were impressed with that of Kilinahe (Kanaʻina's first cousin) and other claimants based on testimony and witnesses. The court decreed that the estate be split into four equal shares: one quarter to go to Haalilio (k), Haalelea (k) and Kahukaiola (k); one quarter each to Pahua (w) and Kaahua (k); and one quarter to the widow and children of Kilinahe, who had died before the adjudication of his claim.|$|E

The post property, now {{being used as a}} roadhouse, soon became known as McCarty's. Another prospector named Alonzo Maxey, and a friend, built Bradley's Roadhouse to compete with McCarty's and by 1907, McCarty's had been transferred to Maxey.|$|E
