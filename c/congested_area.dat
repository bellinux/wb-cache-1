25|$|Over {{the years}} since the last trolley ran in 1954, many people have pushed for the {{reintroduction}} of rail transport in the Twin Cities.

25|$|In 1888 the Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway {{opened a}} 6.5miles (10km) line from Giffen on the Glasgow, Barrhead and Kilmarnock Joint Railway to Ardrossan.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} welfare effect of {{travelling}} through <b>congested</b> <b>areas</b> and adverse weather through {{changes in the}} speed of individuals' car trips based on the entire commuting trip. Weather measurements are local and time specific (hourly basis). As most commuters travel twice a day between home and work, {{we are able to}} employ panel data techniques, which deals with issues related to unobserved heterogeneity and data selection. We find that travelling through <b>congested</b> <b>areas</b> reduces speed by about 7 %. For most commuters the welfare effects of adverse weather conditions are negative but small. However, the commuters' welfare costs due to rain are rather substantial during the evening peak in <b>congested</b> <b>areas</b> (and up to 12 % of the overall commuting costs). © 2010 The Author(s) ...|$|R

2500|$|Initially, Mariner {{performed}} {{routine duty}} at the New York Navy Yard {{and in the}} waters of New York harbor. Following that period of local work, she got underway on 6 February 1918 in company with converted yachts [...] and , bound for New London, Connecticut. The little convoy proceeded uneventfully until increasingly heavy ice floes began to impede their progress. [...] Mariner took Wadena in tow, getting her through one <b>congested</b> <b>area</b> and then dropping the tow when clear. When Wadena again ran into difficulty, Mariner took the yacht in tow, until forced to stop (Yacona then took Wadena in tow for a time) when the ice in Long Island Sound smashed in some of her timbers, compelling Lt.(jg) Miller to order the tug beached at New London to facilitate repairs. Once again seaworthy, Mariner steamed up Narragansett Bay to the coaling station at Melville, Rhode Island, where she helped Yacona get underway for Newport during the afternoon watch on 23 February, then proceeded to assist the section patrol boat [...] that had suffered a fire at Melville later that same day. Mariner then shifted to Newport.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{the design}} of the London Tube map (as a kind of {{schematic}} map) has been popularly adopted for transport network maps worldwide because of its great clarity of representation. In such types of map, the shape of the network is simplified and the topology between lines is preserved while the <b>congested</b> <b>areas</b> are enlarged to a desirable scale. Efforts have also been made to automate the production of such maps. However, to our best knowledge, no existing methods have explicitly taken into consideration the automated enlargement of <b>congested</b> <b>areas.</b> As such an enlargement is vital to the improvement of clarity, this paper proposes a new automated method to generate schematic network maps, consisting of (a) automated detection of <b>congested</b> <b>areas,</b> (b) automated enlargement of <b>congested</b> <b>areas</b> to a desirable scale and (c) automated generation of the schematic representation of the deformed network maps using a stroke-based approach. The new method has been tested with two real-life network data sets, i. e. the London Tube and Hong Kong metro data sets, and evaluated by fractal analysis and experimental studies. The results of the evaluation indicate that the new method is able to automatically generate the schematic maps with improved clarity and aesthetics.
