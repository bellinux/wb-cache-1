5|$|Espejo {{was noted}} in his time for being a satirist. His satirical works, {{inspired}} by {{the philosophy of the}} Age of Enlightenment, were critical of the lack of education of the Audiencia of Quito, the way the economy was being handled in the Audiencia, the <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> its authorities, and aspects of its culture in general. Because of these works he was persecuted and finally imprisoned shortly before his death.|$|E
5|$|Many {{scholars}} {{consider the}} figures of Gullveig/Heiðr and Freyja the same. These conclusions have been made through comparisons between the figure of Gullveig/Heiðr's use of seiðr in Völuspá and the mention of Freyja introducing seiðr to the Æsir from the Vanir in Heimskringla. This is at times taken further that their <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> the Æsir led to the Æsir–Vanir War.|$|E
5|$|Music {{critics have}} {{frequently}} {{commented on the}} recurring theme in Britten's operas from Peter Grimes onward of the isolated individual at odds with a hostile society. The extent to which this reflected Britten's perception of himself, pacifist and homosexual, in the England of the 1930s, 40s and 50s is debated. Another recurrent theme is the <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> innocence, most sharply seen in The Turn of the Screw.|$|E

5|$|Reacting to Cruyff's departure, an {{independent}} protest group was organised by Armand Caraben, Joan Laporta and Alfons Godall. The {{objective of the}} group, called L'Elefant Blau was to oppose the presidency of Núñez, which they regarded as a <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> the club's traditional values. Laporta would later take over the presidency of Barcelona in 2003.|$|E
5|$|The Latinised form, Wornesell, {{appears in}} the Kent Hundred Rolls of 127475 and in a mediaeval will {{recorded}} in September 1409. A <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> the name, Wormsell, is mentioned as the birthplace of a Cistercian Abbot at the nearby Boxley Abbey in 1474; a further variant, Wormysell, is found in a will of 1487, and court papers concerning a land dispute in 1534 use the name Wormeshell.|$|E
5|$|The new tolls {{cause the}} price of food and other {{essentials}} to rise, enriching both Süß and the Duke. Süß gains the authority to levy taxes on salt, beer, wine, and wheat as well. He also assists in procuring local women for the Duke, thus engaging in the <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> their morals. The increase in {{the price of}} basic necessities causes the people of Württemberg to suffer great privation.|$|E

5|$|Though the {{pamphlet}} describes the pitiable and desperate {{conditions in which}} prostitutes lived, and the <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> the police supposed to be patrol them, it also accuses prostitutes of 'Inhumanity' and deems them devilish and monstrous.

5|$|Although {{his suicide}} is often {{linked to the}} Foundation’s {{financial}} difficulties, the letter clearly shows Favaloro overwhelmed by the <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> the health system and feeling {{that he could not}} fight against this powerful organization. In some parts of the letter, he refers to himself as “Don Quijote” in his lonely battle against the giants. Aggravating this situation was that Favaloro had never recovered from the death of his wife in 1998. Following her death, he had resolved to marry one of his longtime colleagues and coauthors, Diana Truden; she lived with Favaloro during his final days and was in his Palermo neighborhood house when he committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|As {{a patron}} James V {{supported}} poets William Stewart and John Bellenden. Stewart produced a verse {{version of the}} Latin History of Scotland compiled in 1527 by Boece and Bellenden produced a prose translation of Livy's History of Rome in 1533. Sir David Lindsay of the Mount the Lord Lyon, {{the head of the}} Lyon Court and diplomat, was a prolific poet. He produced an interlude at Linlithgow Palace thought to be a version of his play The Thrie Estaitis in 1540, the first surviving full Scottish play, which satirised the <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> church and state, making use of elements such as medieval morality plays, with a humanist agenda.|$|E

5|$|At this juncture, the Roman empire was convulsed by {{its first}} major civil war since the Battle of Actium exactly a century earlier: the Year of the Four Emperors (69-70 AD). The {{governor}} of Germania Inferior, ordered {{to raise more}} troops, outraged the Batavi by attempting to conscript more Batavi than the maximum stipulated in their treaty. The brutality and <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> the Roman recruiting-centurions (including incidents of sexual assault on Batavi young men) brought already deep discontent in the Batavi homeland to the boil.|$|E
5|$|His {{influence}} can {{as well be}} seen in Ecuadorian {{thought in}} general, as his work {{has been one of}} its principal influences; Ecuadorian education, as he promoted new pedagogical ideas, such as the creation of good citizens instead of merely imparting knowledge, and finally Ecuadorian science, as he was, along with Pedro Vicente Maldonado, one of the two most important scientists of colonial Ecuador. Espejo analyzed the reality of colonial Quito, the poverty of its people and their lack of good education, and he denounced the <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> the colonial authorities.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, {{while they}} were still dating, Achebe {{dedicated}} to Christie Okoli his second novel, No Longer at Ease, about a civil servant who is embroiled in the <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> Lagos. The protagonist is Obi, grandson of Things Fall Aparts main character, Okonkwo. Drawing on his time in the city, Achebe writes about Obi's experiences in Lagos to reflect the challenges facing a new generation on the threshold of Nigerian independence. Obi is trapped between the expectations of his family, its clan, his home village, and larger society. He is crushed by these forces (like his grandfather before him) and finds himself imprisoned for bribery. Having shown his acumen for portraying traditional Igbo culture, Achebe demonstrated in his second novel an ability to depict modern Nigerian life.|$|E

5|$|Loughor Castle was {{constructed}} {{on the western}} edge of the Welsh commote, or land unit, of Gwyr. The castle was built shortly after 1106, when Henry de Beaumont, the Earl of Warwick, was given the Gower Peninsula by Henry I. The Anglo-Norman colonisation of the region followed, with Gower becoming a Marcher territory, enjoying extensive local independence. Loughor Castle was strategically important because it controlled the main road running through Gywr from Beaumont's main base at Swansea Castle, and was a valuable coastal port. The castle took its name from a <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> the title of the Roman fort.|$|E
5|$|Orr's first {{professional}} contract {{was one of}} the first in professional ice hockey to be negotiated by an agent. It made him the highest-paid player in NHL history as a rookie. His second contract was the first million-dollar contract in the NHL. However, after his retirement, Orr learned he was deeply in debt and he had to sell off most of what he owned. Orr broke with his agent Alan Eagleson and sued the Black Hawks to settle his contract. Orr and his family returned to Boston where Orr went into business to rebuild his finances. Orr aided the investigations that led to Eagleson's fraud convictions and disbarment. Orr also supported the lawsuit that exposed the <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> the NHL's pension plan.|$|E

5|$|The disquilibrium and {{perceived}} <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> the electoral and political process led, in 1966, to back-to-back military coups.

The coup plotters succeeded in murdering Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, Premier Ahmadu Bello of the Northern Region and Premier Ladoke Akintola of the Western Region. But, the coup plotters struggled to form a central government. President Nwafor Orizu handed over government control to the Army, then {{under the command of}} another Igbo officer, General JTU Aguiyi-Ironsi.|$|E
