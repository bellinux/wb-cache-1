500|$|The {{title track}} is {{composed}} in Madonna's typical style—mixing a drum machine, bubbling bass synth line, {{and the sound}} of stringed instruments. According to Rikky Rooksby, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, the three parts of the song, namely the bridge, where Madonna sings [...] "what <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> now", the chorus and the verse flow together in a coherent manner, with the chorus incorporating a haunting effect. The song epitomized Madonna's interest with Hispanic culture that continued after the release of her 1987 single [...] "La Isla Bonita". Leonard and Madonna had added Spanish phrases in the chorus, over the trumpets of the second verse, and also in the added instrumental break in the middle. [...] "Who's That Girl" [...] also makes use of the sonic effect brought about by the combination of multiple vocal lines, which had been previously used by groups like The Beach Boys in their singles [...] "God Only Knows" [...] (1966) and [...] "I Get Around" [...] (1964) as well as R.E.M.'s singles [...] "Fall on Me" [...] (1986) and [...] "Near Wild Heaven" [...] (1991). [...] "Who's That Girl" [...] employs this effect on the last chorus where three or four different vocal hooks are intertwined.|$|E
