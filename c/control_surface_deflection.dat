40|$|A {{continuation}} {{method has}} been used to determine the steady states of three nonlinear aircraft models: a general aviation aircraft with a canard configuration, a generic jet fighter, and the F- 14. The continuation method calculated the steady states of the aircraft as functions of the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> <b>deflections.</b> Bifurcations of these steady states were determined and shown to cause instabilities which resulted in qualitative changes {{in the state of the}} aircraft. A longitudinal instability which resulted in a deep stall was determined for the general aviation aircraft. Roll-coupling and high angle of attack instabilities were determined for the generic jet fighter, and wing rock, directional divergence and high angle of attack instabilities were determined for the F- 14. Knowledge of the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> <b>deflections</b> at which bifurcations occurred was used to either put limits on the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> <b>deflections</b> or to program the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> <b>deflections</b> such that a combination of <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> <b>deflections</b> at which bifurcations occur could not be attained.

40|$|The {{hypersonic}} aerodynamic {{characteristics of}} a winged body concept representing a candidate single- stage-to-orbit vehicle which features wing tip fin controllers and elevon/body flap control surfa'Fs are predicted at points along a nominal trajectory for Mach numbers from 5 to 27 and angles of attack from 19 to 32 degrees. Predictions are derived from surface properties based on flow solvers for inviscid and viscous, laminar flows acting as a perfect gas, as a gas in chemical equilibrium and as a gas in chemical non- equilibrium. At a Mach number of 22, the lateral aerodynamic characteristics of the vehicle are determined based on an inviscid analysis at side slip angles of 2 and 4 degrees and 32 degrees angle of attack; a viscous analysis was carried out {{to determine the effect}} of gas chemistry model on surface pressure and to determine the incremental aerodynamics for <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> <b>deflections.</b> The results show that the longitudinal pitch characteristics of the baseline configuration, i. e., zero <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> <b>deflections,</b> are significantly altered by real gas chemistry at angles of attack greater than 30 degrees and Mach numbers greater than 9; and, that aerodynamics derived from inviscid solutions are of sufficient accuracy for preliminary analysis.

5000|$|Traditional {{aircraft}} maneuvering {{is accomplished}} by altering the flow of air passing over the control surfaces of the aircraft—the ailerons, elevators, flaps, air brakes and rudder. Some of these control surfaces can be combined—such as in the [...] "ruddervators" [...] of a V-tail configuration—but the basic properties are unaffected. When a control surface is moved to present an angle to the oncoming airflow, it alters the airflow around the surface, changing its pressure distribution, and thus applying a pitching, rolling, or yawing moment to the aircraft. The angle of <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> <b>deflection</b> and resulting directional force on the aircraft are controlled both by the pilot and the aircraft's inbuilt control systems to maintain the desired attitude, such as pitch, roll and heading, and also to perform aerobatic maneuvers that rapidly change the aircraft's attitude. For traditional maneuvering control to be maintained, the aircraft must maintain sufficient forward velocity and a sufficiently low angle of attack to provide airflow over the wings (maintaining lift) and also over its control surfaces. As airflow decreases so does effectiveness of the control surfaces and thus the maneuverability. On the other hand, if the angle of attack exceeds its critical value, the airplane will stall. Pilots are trained to avoid stalls during aerobatic maneuvering and especially in combat, as a stall can permit an opponent to gain an advantageous position while the stalled aircraft's pilot attempts to recover.|$|E

However, when applied to the manoeuvrability of autonomous underwater vehicles, AUVs, most {{studies have focused on}} the de- termination of static coefficients without considering the effects of the vehicle <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> <b>deflection.</b> This paper analyses the hydrodynamic efforts generated on an AUV considering the combined effects of the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> <b>deflection</b> and the angle of attack using CFD software based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes formulations. The CFD simulations are also independently conducted for the AUV bare hull and control surface to better identify their individual and interference efforts and to validate the simulations by comparing the experimental results obtained in a towing tank. Several simulations of the bare hull case were conducted to select the k –ω SST turbulent model with the viscosity approach that best predicts its hydrodynamic efforts. Mesh sensitivity analyses were conducted for all simulations. For the flow around the control surfaces, the CFD results were analysed according to two different methodologies, standard and nonlinear. The nonlinear regression methodology provides better results than the standard methodology does for predicting the stall at the control surface. The flow simulations have shown that the occurrence of the control surface stall depends on a linear relationship between the angle of attack and the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> <b>deflection.</b> This type of information can be used in designing the vehicle’s autopilot system.
