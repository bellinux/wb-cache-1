40|$|The {{correlation}} between the molecular size of the surface layer protein (S protein) and both structure and antigenicity of the Campylobacter fetus surface layer (S layer) was investigated in several clinical strains and their spontaneous variants which produce S proteins of molecular weights (MW) {{different from those of}} the parents. Only three molecular sizes of the S proteins were observed (98, 127, and 149 kDa) in the parental and variant strains. Immunologically, the 98 -kDa protein and the 149 -kDa protein but not the 127 -kDa protein were cross-reactive. Freeze-etching analysis showed that the 98 -kDa S protein formed a hexagonal arrangement with a 24 -nm <b>center-to-center</b> <b>space</b> and that the S proteins with larger MW (127 or 149 kDa) formed tetragonal ones with an 8 -nm <b>center-to-center</b> <b>space.</b> Thus, the MW changes of the S proteins seen in the variant strains were associated with both morphological and antigenic changes in S layer. These observations support the hypothesis that the pattern and antigenicity of the C. fetus S layer is determined by the particular type of S protein. Furthermore, the presence of the two different S layer patterns on a single bacterial cell indicates that multiple S proteins can be produced and expressed in a single cell.

Negative staining and computer processing {{of images of}} the crystalline specimens identified two discrete crystalline arrays. The dimensions of the unit cell {{of one of the}} arrays were large enough to accommodate an alpha beta protomer; those of the other array, an (alpha beta) 2 diprotomer. Thin sections of the crystalline fraction contained a unique membrane complex that was formed from two apposed plasma membranes.

From measurements of the dimensions of these structures, we estimate the overall length of the enzyme to be approximately 11. 5 nm along the axis perpendicular to the plane of the membrane, and the molecular protrudes more (approximately 5 nm) on the cytoplasmic surface than on the extracytoplasmic surface (approximately 2 nm) ...|$|R

50|$|As {{mentioned}} {{near the}} beginning of the article, the attainment of a nonfluctuating velocity ratio is dependent on the profile of the teeth.Friction and wear between two gears is also dependent on the tooth profile. There are a great many tooth profiles that provides a constant velocity ratio. In many cases, given an arbitrary tooth shape, it is possible to develop a tooth profile for the mating gear that provides a constant velocity ratio. However, two constant velocity tooth profiles are the most commonly used in modern times: the cycloid and the involute. The cycloid was more common until the late 1800s. Since then, the involute has largely superseded it, particularly in drive train applications. The cycloid is in some ways the more interesting and flexible shape; however the involute has two advantages: it is easier to manufacture, and it permits the <b>center-to-center</b> <b>spacing</b> of the gears to vary over some range without ruining the constancy of the velocity ratio. Cycloidal gears only work properly if the center spacing is exactly right. Cycloidal gears are still used in mechanical clocks.|$|E

The aim {{of the current study}} was to elucidate their functional role using a mouse model for Marfan syndrome, defective in fibrillin- 1, the major structural component of the microfibril bundles that constitute most of the elastic fibers. Methods: Mouse corneas were obtained from animals with a heterozygous fibrillin- 1 mutation (Fbn 1 +/−) and compared to wild type controls. Corneal thickness and radius of curvature were calculated using optical coherence tomography microscopy. Elastic microfibril bundles were quantified and visualized in three-dimensions using serial block face scanning electron microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy was used to analyze stromal ultrastructure and proteoglycan distribution. <b>Center-to-center</b> average interfibrillar <b>spacing</b> was determined using x-ray scattering. Results: Fbn 1 +/− corneas were significantly thinner than wild types and displayed a higher radius of curvature.

40|$|Conventional polymer multielectrode arrays (MEAs) have {{limitations}} {{resulting from}} a high Young’s modulus, including low conformability and gaps between the electrodes and neurons. These gaps are not a problem in soft tissues such as the brain, due to the repopulation phenomenon. However, gaps can result in signal degradation when recording from a fiber bundle, such as the spinal cord. Methods: We propose a method for fabricating flexible polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) -based MEAs featuring plateau-shaped microelectrodes. The proposed fabrication technique enables the electrodes {{on the surface of}} MEAs to make a tight connection to the neurons, because the wire of the MEA is fabricated to be plateau-shaped, as the Young’s modulus of PDMS is similar to soft tissues and PDMS follows the curvature of the neural tissue due to its high conformability compared to the other polymers. Injury caused by the movement of the MEAs can therefore be minimized.

This is also relevant to the most promising items so far, i. e. orbital roller drives (ORD), which are the rotational-to-progressive motion converters widely used in vehicles. The previously published article suggested increasing a load capacity (by about 15 %) through reducing a thread turn section angle of the threaded ORD components and change of the radius of roller thread turn section outline. Due to such ORD modification, a number {{of the most}} critical ORD parameters are to be changed thereby demanding further research. Further, the article published suggests a method considering the abovementioned changes to calculate the dimensions of ORD main components and their tolerance ranges. Though this method being not complete as the increment of ORD <b>center-to-center</b> <b>spacing</b> in relation to its rated value, required for assembly, is unknown; and to determine the ORD <b>center-to-center</b> <b>spacing</b> increment, outer diameters of the roller and screw threads are to be known. Hence, these two methods are interconnected. This article presents the numerical calculation method, mathematical support and method to determine the increment of ORD <b>center-to-center</b> <b>spacing</b> and initial contact point of the mating roller and screw thread turns. Due to considerable scope of calculations, the method was turned into the software. Similar calculation methods and techniques were developed to a particular case, where the thread turn section angle of the threaded components was of 90 °, and the roller thread turn section outline was a circular arc centered to the roller axis. Hence the developed numerical calculation method, mathematical support and technique refer to the general case which is to determine the ORD <b>center-to-center</b> <b>spacing</b> increment and initial contact point of the mating roller and screw thread turns. Taking this into account, the calculations for a particular case were performed as test calculations during the software development. The results obtained matched the calculation results for a particular case published in several papers. Using a developed calculation technique, the calculation method to determine dimensions of ORD main components and their tolerance ranges may be completed for a general case considering the arbitrary turn section angle of threaded ORD components and radius of roller thread turn section outline. </p...|$|E

Several studies have demonstrated decoding of arm and finger tra-jectories from ECoG high-gamma band (80 - 160 Hz) signals. In this study, we systematically vary the velocity of three elementary movement types (pincer grasp, elbow and shoulder flexion/extension) to test whether the high-gamma band encodes for {{the entirety of the}} movements, or merely the movement onset. To this end, linear regression models were created for the durations and amplitudes of high-gamma power bursts and velocity deflections. One subject with 88 high-density ECoG grid (4 mm <b>center-to-center</b> electrode <b>spacing)</b> participated in the experiment. The results of the regression models indicated that the power burst durations varied directly with the move-ment durations (e. g. R 2 = 0. 71 and slope= 1. 0 s/s for elbow). The persistence of power bursts {{for the duration of the}} movement suggests that the primary motor cortex (M 1) is likely active for the entire duration of a movement, instead of providing a marker for the movement onset. On the other hand, the amplitudes were less co-varied. Furthermore, the electrodes of maximum R 2 conformed to somatotopic arrangement of the brain. Also, electrodes responsible for flexion and extension movements could be resolved on the high-density grid. In summary, these findings suggest that M 1 may be directly responsible for activating the individual muscle motor units, and future BCI may be able to utilize them for better control of prostheses.

40|$|The areal {{bit density}} of {{magnetic}} disk recording has increased since 1990 60 % {{per year and}} even in the last years 100 %. Extrapolation of these rates leads to recording parameters not likely to be achieved without changes in the present way of storing hard disk data. One of the possible solutions is the development of so-called patterned magnetic media. Such media will also shift the superparamagnetic limit positively in comparison with the present thin film media. Theoretically, a bit density in the order of Tbits/in 2 may be possible by using this so-called discrete magnetic recording scheme. The patterned structures presented in this paper consist of a regular two-dimensional array of single domain dots with large uniaxial magnetic anisotropy and have been prepared from CoNi/Pt multilayers with strong intergranular exchange coupling and large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. For the preparation of the patterned media, a patterning process based on Laser Interference Lithography method (LIL) and Ion Beam Etching has been developed.

The method takes advantage of newer stimulator design and a programming technique allowing for "continuous" adjustment of contact combination while controlling stimulation current for each contact separately. - Method: Using computer modeling we examined how stimulation of dorsal column (DC) and dorsal root (DR) fibers was influenced by changing the current ratio of the cathodes of a dual (––) and a guarded dual cathode (+––+) configuration programmed on a percutaneous lead with 9 and 4 mm <b>center-to-center</b> contact <b>spacing.</b> - Results: A cathodal current ratio could be found for which DC or DR fiber recruitment and thus, most likely, paresthesia coverage was maximized. The DR threshold profiles shifted longitudinally, thus following the shift in the electrical field during steering. The profiles had a constant shape when the contact spacing was small and a varying shape for wider contact separation. Generally, the wider contact separation provided less DC and more DR fiber recruitment. - Conclusions: By means of cathodal steering on a longitudinal contact array, the group of excited DC and DR fibers, and thus paresthesia coverage, can be controlled when using SCS. With widely spaced contacts, superposition of the electrical field from each steering contact is limited. To precisely control segmental paresthesia (DR stimulation), a small contact spacing is necessary...|$|R
