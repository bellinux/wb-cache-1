Actor Kirk Douglas was one of Como's television guests; Douglas had grown a beard for his Vincent van Gogh role in Lust For Life, which finished filming that week. Como shaved Douglas' movie beard live on national television. On September 15, 1956, the season premiere of The Perry Como Show was broadcast from NBC's new <b>color</b> <b>television</b> studios at the New York Ziegfeld Theatre, {{making it one of the}} first weekly color TV shows. In addition to this season premiere as a <b>color</b> <b>television</b> show, there was also a royal visit from Prince Rainier of Monaco and his bride of six months, Grace Kelly.|$|E

Barbera's involvement in Colonel Bleep (and with Buchanan) was apparently short-lived; his only known credited involvement was a creator credit.|$|E

NBC (owned by RCA) made its first field test of <b>color</b> <b>television</b> on February 20, 1941. CBS began daily color field tests on June 1, 1941. These color systems were not compatible with existing black-and-white television sets, and as no <b>color</b> <b>television</b> sets were {{available to the public}} at this time, viewing of the color field tests was restricted to RCA and CBS engineers and the invited press. The War Production Board halted the manufacture of television and radio equipment for civilian use from April 22, 1942 to August 20, 1945, limiting any opportunity to introduce <b>color</b> <b>television</b> to the general public.|$|E

South Korea did not introduce <b>color</b> <b>television</b> (using NTSC) until 1980 (full-time color transmissions began in 1981), although it was already manufacturing <b>color</b> <b>television</b> sets for export. Cambodia was the last country in Asia to introduce <b>color</b> <b>television,</b> officially introduced in 1981 using the PAL system, with full-time color transmissions since 1985.|$|E
25|$|Among the {{earliest}} published proposals for television was one by Maurice Le Blanc in 1880 for a color system, {{including the first}} mentions in television literature of line and frame scanning, although he gave no practical details. Polish inventor Jan Szczepanik patented a <b>color</b> <b>television</b> system in 1897, using a selenium photoelectric cell at the transmitter and an electromagnet controlling an oscillating mirror and a moving prism at the receiver. But his system contained no means of analyzing the spectrum of colors at the transmitting end, and could not have worked as he described it. An Armenian inventor, Hovannes Adamian, also experimented with <b>color</b> <b>television</b> as early as 1907. The first <b>color</b> <b>television</b> project is claimed by him, and was patented in Germany on March 31, 1908, patent № 197183, then in Britain, on April 1, 1908, patent № 7219, in France (patent № 390326) and in Russia in 1910 (patent № 17912).|$|E

25|$|On October 25, 1951, ODM even {{ordered a}} halt to the mass {{production}} of <b>color</b> <b>television</b> sets by CBS. CBS had developed a color system which was partly mechanical and partly electronic in nature. RCA had already developed a purely electronic <b>color</b> <b>television</b> system, and was engaged in a long and bitter legal battle with CBS before the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) over which system would be adopted. Although ODM had determined that research on color TV occupied the time of critically needed scientists and technicians, the research also had defense applications and could therefore proceed. However, production of the CBS color TV sets was not essential, and was banned. The ban on mass production of the CBS <b>color</b> <b>television</b> set led the FCC to choose the RCA system by default in 1953. That system was used in the US until June 12, 2009, when it was succeeded by the ATSC set of standards.|$|E
25|$|More European {{countries}} introduced <b>color</b> <b>television</b> {{using the}} PAL {{system in the}} 1970s and early 1980s; examples include Denmark (1970), Belgium (1971), Yugoslavia/Serbia (1971), Spain (1972, but not fully implemented until 1978), Iceland (1973), Portugal (1976, but not fully implemented until 1980), Albania (1981), and Turkey (1981) and Romania (1983, but not fully implemented until 1990). In Italy there were debates to adopt a national <b>color</b> <b>television</b> system, the ISA, developed by Indesit, but that idea was scrapped. As a result, Italy {{was one of the}} last European countries to officially adopt the PAL system in 1977.|$|E

50|$|The {{shadow mask}} {{is one of}} the {{technologies}} used to manufacture cathode ray tube (CRT) televisions and computer displays that produce color images. Another approach is the aperture grille, better known by its trade name, Trinitron. All early <b>color</b> <b>televisions</b> and the majority of CRT computer monitors used shadow mask technology. Both of these technologies are largely obsolete, having been increasingly replaced since the 1990s by the liquid-crystal display (LCD).|$|R
5000|$|The most {{significant}} difference between Cromaclear CRTs and existing CRT computer monitor technologies is their phosphor pattern. Older <b>color</b> <b>televisions</b> and most CRT monitors have a pattern of round dots arranged in a triangular mosaic. Slot-mask CRTs have a pattern of stripes in the unlit phosphor {{that appears to be}} bricks when in use. The slots block less of the electron beam than dots, resulting in a brighter picture.|$|R
