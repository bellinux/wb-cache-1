5|$|Adhesive forces {{between a}} liquid and solid cause a liquid drop to {{spread across the}} surface. <b>Cohesive</b> forces within the liquid cause the drop to ball up and avoid contact with the surface.|$|E
5|$|In 2016 The Economist {{reported}} that the SNA did not exist as a <b>cohesive</b> force due to high rates of desertions and many soldiers being primarily loyal to clan leaders rather than the government.|$|E
5|$|Snowflakes {{nucleate}} around mineral or organic {{particles in}} moisture-saturated, subfreezing air masses. They grow by net accretion to the incipient crystals in hexagonal formations. The <b>cohesive</b> forces are primarily electrostatic.|$|E
5|$|After the {{revisions}} were completed, much of {{the plot}} stayed the same, but several events in the original draft were cut out to strengthen the whole book. Stead combined two characters into one, having a stronger outline and also cut out several scenes for minor characters. In the end, Stead found that the revisions helped to make the book more <b>cohesive.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mass Effect 2 (PC, PS3, Xbox 360) by BioWare, {{the most}} {{acclaimed}} {{game of the}} Mass Effect series, set a new standard for expansive yet <b>cohesive</b> storytelling and character development. It {{remains one of the}} best reviewed games of the generation (96% on Metacritic for the 360 version) and won numerous awards including the BAFTA and AIAS Game of the Year awards.|$|E
5|$|The book {{is divided}} into 27 chapters, with a prelude, coda, {{bibliography}} and index. Each chapter deals with a new topic, such as the potential fates of plastics, petroleum infrastructure, nuclear facilities, and artworks. It is written {{from the point of}} view of a science journalist with explanations and testimonies backing his predictions. There is no unifying narrative, <b>cohesive</b> single-chapter overview, or thesis.|$|E
5|$|The {{contact angle}} (θ), {{as seen in}} Figure 1, is the angle at which the liquid–vapor {{interface}} meets the solid-liquid interface. The contact angle {{is determined by the}} result between adhesive and <b>cohesive</b> forces. As the tendency of a drop to spread out over a flat, solid surface increases, the contact angle decreases. Thus, the contact angle provides an inverse measure of wettability.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} considerable {{praise for}} its technically challenging racing and fusion {{of popular culture}} elements. Many critics praised the unique blend of techno music and designer logos in one <b>cohesive</b> futuristic racing universe {{as the beginning of}} a new trend in gaming to tap into popular culture and other arts, which was made possible by the new storage space of the time.|$|E
5|$|A limited genetic {{sampling}} of species in a 1996 study by Annette Kretzer and colleagues showed Suillus bovinus {{was related to}} a lineage that diverged to S.punctipes, S.variegatus and S.tomentosus. A 2001 study found it was not closely related to other European species, and that all populations tested were more closer to each other than any other and hence it was a <b>cohesive</b> species.|$|E
5|$|After {{the turn}} of the 19th century, {{architecture}} developed into the late Baroque style. Among the major proponents were Johan Conrad Ernst who built the Chancery Building or Kancellibygningen (1721) on Slotsholmen and Lauritz de Thurah who designed the Eremitage Palace (1734) in Dyrehaven, just north of Copenhagen. Even more ambitious was de Thurah's work at Ledreborg near Roskilde, where he succeeded in working the components into a well-balanced and <b>cohesive</b> Baroque palace.|$|E
5|$|Argentina was {{the first}} Latin American country with a gay rights group, Nuestro Mundo (NM, or Our World), created in 1969. Six mostly secret {{organizations}} concentrating on gay or lesbian issues were founded around this time, but persecution and harassment were continuous and grew worse with the dictatorship of Jorge Rafael Videla in 1976, when all groups were dissolved in the Dirty War. Lesbian rights groups have gradually formed since 1986 to build a <b>cohesive</b> community that works to overcome philosophical differences with heterosexual women.|$|E
5|$|Clips from Last Clear Chance are {{featured}} in 2004's Panorama Ephemera, a film created by Rick Prelinger which compiles clips from 64 short films {{in order to}} form a <b>cohesive</b> narrative. The clip used from Last Clear Chance is the scene where Frank Jr. and Betty drive {{into the path of}} an oncoming train. Panorama Ephemera can be downloaded or streamed for free at the Internet Archive.|$|E
5|$|In the Rights of Men, Wollstonecraft {{not only}} endorses republicanism, {{but also a}} social {{contract}} based on sympathy and fellow-feeling. She describes the ideal society in these terms: individuals, supported by <b>cohesive</b> families, connect with others through rational sympathy. Strongly influenced by Price, whom she had met at Newington Green {{just a few years}} earlier, Wollstonecraft asserts that people should strive to imitate God by practicing universal benevolence.|$|E
5|$|It {{was over}} {{a year before the}} 2nd Division came {{together}} as a <b>cohesive</b> unit and, during the interim period between formation and arrival in the United Kingdom, many changes to its organization were made. The first brigade concentrations took place in May and June 1940, until which time all units had trained in their own garrisons. The 4th Brigade assembled at Camp Borden in Ontario, the 5th at Valcartier Camp in Quebec, and the 6th at Camp Shilo in Manitoba. The divisional artillery was concentrated at artillery training centres at Camp Petawawa in Ontario, and at Shilo.|$|E
5|$|Parts of {{the myth}} appear {{in a wide variety}} of Egyptian texts, from funerary texts and magical spells to short stories. The story is, therefore, more {{detailed}} and more <b>cohesive</b> than any other ancient Egyptian myth. Yet no Egyptian source gives a full account {{of the myth}}, and the sources vary widely in their versions of events. Greek and Roman writings, particularly De Iside et Osiride by Plutarch, provide more information but may not always accurately reflect Egyptian beliefs. Through these writings, the Osiris myth persisted after knowledge of most ancient Egyptian beliefs was lost, and it is still well known today.|$|E
5|$|Rebel Heart is {{the thirteenth}} studio album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Madonna. It {{was released on}} March 6, 2015, by Interscope Records. Following {{the completion of the}} MDNA release and promotion, Madonna worked on the album throughout 2014, co-writing and co-producing it with various musicians, including Diplo, Avicii, and Kanye West. She regularly uploaded pictures of her recording sessions on her Instagram account. Unlike her previous efforts, which involved only a few people, working with a large number of collaborators posed problems for Madonna in keeping a <b>cohesive</b> sound and creative direction for the album.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting the {{new school}} and ghettoblaster {{subculture}} in the U.S. during the mid-1980s, Radio belongs to a pivotal {{moment in the history}} and culture of hip hop. Its success contributed to the displacement of the old school with {{the new school}} form and to the genre's mainstream success during the period. Its success also served as a career breakthrough for LL Cool J and Rick Rubin. Radio has been recognized by music writers {{as one of the first}} <b>cohesive</b> and commercially successful hip hop albums.|$|E
5|$|Resident: These are {{the most}} {{commonly}} sighted of the three populations in the coastal waters of the northeast Pacific. Residents' diets consist primarily of fish and sometimes squid, and they live in complex and <b>cohesive</b> family groups called pods. Female residents characteristically have rounded dorsal fin tips that terminate in a sharp corner. They visit the same areas consistently. British Columbia and Washington resident populations are amongst the most intensively studied marine mammals anywhere in the world. Researchers have identified and named over 300 killer whales over the past 30 years.|$|E
5|$|The 8th Military Police Brigade (Provisional) was {{constituted}} in South Korea in September 1984 {{in response}} to the need for <b>cohesive</b> command and control element in the event of war, for the numerous non-divisional Military Police units on the peninsula. At the time it consisted of the 94th Military Police Battalion in Yongsan (Seoul) and the 728th Military Police Battalion in Taegu (Camp Walker). However, the brigade would remain provisional and would not be officially activated for another ten years while it operated in this capacity.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{announced}} {{to be released}} on 3 April 2015 with a new track from the album being announced each month. However, due to an Internet leak, the release was brought forward. Entirely produced by Diamandis and David Kosten, the album was praised for its <b>cohesive</b> sound. Froot debuted at number 8 on the Billboard 200 chart, and is currently her highest charting album in the United States. Froot peaked at 10 in the UK.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cohesive</b> forces among liquid {{molecules}} {{are responsible}} for the phenomenon of surface tension. In the bulk of the liquid, each molecule is pulled equally in every direction by neighboring liquid molecules, resulting in a net force of zero. The molecules at the surface {{do not have the same}} molecules on all sides of them and therefore are pulled inwards. This creates some internal pressure and forces liquid surfaces to contract to the minimal area.|$|E
5|$|The idea {{going in}} was to {{juxtapose}} my singing style with a hardcore hip-hop sensibility {{and have the}} finished product still sound like a Madonna record. I began the process by meeting with the hip-hop producers whose work I most admired. It was important, if I were to {{use a variety of}} collaborators, that the end product sound <b>cohesive</b> and thematically whole. I wasn't interested in the variety pack approach.|$|E
5|$|The {{principle}} {{roads in}} Windy Nook are Windy Nook Road and Albion Road, but several housing developments lack <b>cohesive</b> road links and some streets lead to dead ends. Journey time by car or bus to Gateshead town centre is approximately ten minutes, and fifteen {{minutes into the}} centre of Newcastle upon Tyne. Residents have a comparatively high level of car ownership; 71% as compared to a borough average of 56.8%.|$|E
5|$|The {{reformed}} band {{worked at}} a prolific pace, rehearsing, and touring France before recording three new albums in just 12 months, beginning with Godbluff (October 1975). Unlike the earlier work with John Anthony at Trident, the sessions were produced by the band themselves, and both the Melody Maker and Sounds thought they were a tighter and more <b>cohesive</b> unit than previously. The album in particular saw Hammill making significant use of the Hohner clavinet keyboard. Still Life followed on 15 April 1976. Banton considers this album one of his favourites by the group.|$|E
5|$|The {{weaknesses}} of the VKJ in strategy, structure, equipment, mobility and supply were exacerbated by serious ethnic disunity within Yugoslavia, resulting from two decades of Serb hegemony and the attendant lack of political legitimacy achieved by the central government. Attempts to address the disunity came too late {{to ensure that the}} VKJ was a <b>cohesive</b> force. Fifth column activity was also a serious concern, not only from the Croatian nationalist Ustaše but also from the country's Slovene and ethnic German minorities.|$|E

5|$|Wetting is {{the ability}} of a liquid to {{maintain}} contact with a solid surface, resulting from intermolecular interactions when the two are brought together. The degree of wetting (wettability) is determined by a force balance between adhesive and <b>cohesive</b> forces. Wetting deals with the three phases of materials: gas, liquid, and solid. It is now a center of attention in nanotechnology and nanoscience studies due to the advent of many nanomaterials {{in the past two decades}} (e.g. graphene, carbon nanotube, boron nitride nanomesh).|$|E
5|$|Continuing the {{tradition}} {{set by the}} first game, Wipeout 3 contains electronica offerings from various artists, including The Chemical Brothers, Orbital, and the Propellerheads. Psygnosis' development manager, Enda Carey, focused on bringing together music early in the game's development cycle, instead of as an afterthought or last-minute addition to the game. Unlike previous soundtracks, Psygnosis selected a single music director, DJ Sasha, who worked with artists to create a <b>cohesive</b> soundtrack. Sasha included several of his own tracks made specifically for the game. The game disc is a Mixed Mode CD that allows Wipeout 3s soundtrack to be played in a standard compact disc player. To promote Wipeout 3 and its game music, Psygnosis sponsored a Global Underground tour for Sasha. Game pods featuring Wipeout 3 were placed at parties and venues, accompanied by a tie-in marketing campaign.|$|E
5|$|Critics cited Arkham Origins {{handling}} of the genesis of Batman's relationships with his adversaries and allies and its question of whether Batman's presence enhances crime in Gotham City as the game's greatest assets. Scenes with the Joker received the most praise, with Polygon saying that although {{he was also a}} central antagonist in previous Arkham games, the story shone new light on the character; GameSpot called the story surprising in its exploration of the bond and similarities between Batman and the Joker. The story was criticized for lacking a <b>cohesive</b> narrative (particularly the opening plot line of assassins hunting Batman, largely forgotten by the game's end), but EGM said that when it works, the story was worthy of any Batman film, TV show or comic book.|$|E
5|$|Crowley's {{thought was}} not always <b>cohesive,</b> and was {{influenced}} {{by a variety of}} sources, ranging from eastern religious movements and practices like Hindu yoga and Buddhism, scientific naturalism, and various currents within Western esotericism, among them ceremonial magic, alchemy, astrology, Rosicrucianism, Kabbalah, and the Tarot. He was steeped in the esoteric teachings he had learned from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, although pushed further with his own interpretations and strategies than the Golden Dawn had done. Crowley incorporated concepts and terminology from South Asian religious traditions like yoga and Tantra into his Thelemic system, believing that there was a fundamental underlying resemblance between Western and Eastern spiritual systems.|$|E
5|$|During {{his early}} career, Caesar had seen how chaotic and {{dysfunctional}} the Roman Republic had become. The republican machinery {{had broken down}} {{under the weight of}} imperialism, the central government had become powerless, the provinces had been transformed into independent principalities under the absolute control of their governors, and the army had replaced the constitution as the means of accomplishing political goals. Between his crossing of the Rubicon river in 49 BC, and his assassination in 44 BC, Caesar established a new constitution, which was intended to accomplish three separate goals. First, he wanted to suppress all armed resistance out in the provinces, and thus bring order back to the empire. Second, he wanted to create a strong central government in Rome. And finally, he wanted to knit together the entire empire into a single <b>cohesive</b> unit.|$|E
5|$|Hannibal, on {{the other}} hand, had {{deployed}} his forces based on the particular fighting qualities of each unit, taking into consideration both their strengths and weaknesses. This aspect of Hannibal's leadership was highlighted {{in the use of}} a Spanish unit, the Balearic slingers, whom he placed behind the infantry to hurl their ranged missiles into the masses of Roman troops. He placed his Iberians and Gauls in the middle, alternating the ethnic composition across the front line, with himself at the front and center. Infantry from Punic Africa was on the wings at the very edge of his infantry line. These infantry were battle-hardened, remained <b>cohesive</b> and would attack the Roman flanks.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the relativistic contraction and binding of the 7s subshell, the 6d5/2 orbital {{is expected to be}} destabilized due to spin-orbit coupling, making it behave similarly to the 7s orbital in terms of size, shape, and energy. Hence copernicium may not be a noble metal, but rather a semiconductor with a band gap of around 0.2eV. Copernicium is expected to crystallize in the hexagonal close-packed crystal structure, with lattice parameters a=332pm and c=540pm. The c/a ratio of 1.63 is the ideal value, establishing a kinship between solid copernicium and the solid noble gases, though its <b>cohesive</b> energy (enthalpy of crystallization) should be on the order of that of mercury rather than be near the lower value of the noble gases.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century the romantic medieval gothic style {{appeared}} as a backlash to the symmetry of Palladianism which brought certain changes to the city's appearance. Many of the new churches, for example, {{were built in the}} gothic style as were a number of new villas. Most of the new civic and retail buildings however continued to be designed in the classical mode but along much more ornamented and elborate lines than their 18th century predecessors. However virtually all the new buildings were constructed using the local bath stone so the city continued to have a <b>cohesive</b> look. By the middle of the 19th century, as a result of new technology, construction was able to develop incorporating steel as a building component.|$|E
5|$|Ions in ionic {{compounds}} {{are primarily}} {{held together by}} the electrostatic forces between the charge distribution of these bodies, {{and in particular the}} ionic bond resulting from the long-ranged Coulomb attraction between the net negative charge of the anions and net positive charge of the cations. There is also a small additional attractive force from van der Waals interactions which contributes only around 1–2% of the <b>cohesive</b> energy for small ions. When a pair of ions comes close enough for their outer electron shells (most simple ions have closed shells) to overlap, a short-ranged repulsive force occurs, due to the Pauli exclusion principle. The balance between these forces leads to a potential energy well with a minimum energy when the nuclei are separated by a specific equilibrium distance.|$|E
