At the Institute of Agricultural Mechanization of the University of Agriculture in Lublin a design of a tracing <b>cutting</b> <b>assembly</b> was developed whose main objective was to reduce the cutting height of the grain combine harvester. In the following investigation two types of the Z 056 Bizon-Super grain combine harvester were compared: one with the standard <b>cutting</b> <b>assembly</b> and the other with the tracing <b>cutting</b> <b>assembly.</b> The results showed that the use of the tracing <b>cutting</b> <b>assembly</b> led to an average reduction of total seed losses from 17. 4 % to 5. 3 %. Average losses caused by headers equipped with the tracing <b>cutting</b> <b>assembly</b> were 4. 5 % compared to the 16. 5 % typical of the standard design. The losses caused by the threshing assembly averaged 0. 84 % for both types of the harvester. Of the total losses caused by the headers, seeds from pods attached to the stubble made up the biggest fraction. This fraction amounted to 2. 1 % for the harvesters equipped with the tracing <b>cutting</b> <b>assembly</b> and 8. 3 % for the standard harvesters.

40|$|Since 1990 s, the {{complexity}} and frequency of orthopaedic interventions involving bone <b>cutting</b> and <b>assembly</b> have led to extensive development of computer assistance technologies to improve clinical outcomes through increased accuracy and reproducibility. Navigation systems, robots and patient-specific instruments are undergoing clinical trials or are already in use for knee and hip arthroplasty, high tibial open-wedge osteotomy, periacetabular osteotomy, tumor resection, craniotomy, and maxillofacial osteotomy [1 - 9]. In 2004, the methodology for evaluating the quality in orthopaedic surgery was subject to a substantial evolutionary step with the International Society for Computer Assisted Orthopaedic Surgery (CAOS-int) {{in conjunction with the}} American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) [10]. These societies undertook {{the creation of a new}} ASTM standard for assessing and comparing the performances of CAOS systems. This standard was published in 2010 as F 2554 - 10 [11] and used the definition of accuracy and precision parameters provided by the ASTM standard E 177 - 08 [12]. The standard F 2554 - 10 was recently used for assessing the positioning accuracy of surgical assistance systems [13, 14]. However, this attempt at formulating an objective methodology for evaluating the quality in orthopaedic surgery did not account for the standards from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that are commonly used in mechanical engineering since years [15], especially the ISO 1101 standard that is applied since the 1980 s for evaluating mechanical <b>cutting</b> and <b>assembly</b> processes [16]. Considering bone as a specific mechanical material, the ISO 1101 standard could be used to define the dimensional and geometrical specifications of the desired bone <b>cutting</b> and <b>assemblies</b> and evaluate the quality of the performed <b>cutting</b> and <b>assemblies.</b> Implicitly, this ISO-based methodological idea is already known among the scientific community. In 2009, Pearle et al. [17] and Rivkin et al. [18] have proposed the concept of orthopaedic quantitative and objective surgery, by emphasizing the needs for quantitative and objective data for evaluating the added value of assistance technologies. However, despite its obvious conformity with the ISO standards methodology, no research work undertook to implement this quantitative and objective surgery concept by specifically using the ISO 1101 standard and guidelines. In this context, we propose a new quality concept, called ISO-CAOS, which aims at formulating and validating the first ISO-based evaluation of the quality of bone <b>cutting</b> and <b>assembly</b> in CAOS surgery. The specific objectives we aim to achieve are (1) to develop new quantitative models of bone <b>cutting</b> and <b>assembly</b> that comply with the standard ISO 1101, and (2) to implement new objective methods and techniques for measuring the quality in CAOS surgery that comply with the common ISO guidelines...|$|R

Thereafter, the Monte-Carlo sampling method is used to calculate, in post-processing, the iron loss density in a PMSM that is modelled by the finite element method. The interest of such an approach is emphasized by calculating the main statistical characteristics associated to the losses variability, which are Gaussian distributed for A and O formulations.

40|$|A high-speed, high-precision chip formation-based micro-groove {{cutting process}} has been {{developed}} for cutting grooves in metals with nearly arbitrarily shaped cross-sections, which have widths and depths {{of a few hundred}} nanometers to a few microns, and lengths of tens of millimeters. A flexible tool, consisting of a single-point cutting geometry mounted {{on the end of a}} small cantilever, is moved along a workpiece surface while a constant cantilever deflection is maintained to apply a cutting load. Depth of cut for a given tool shape is determined by cutting load and workpiece material properties. A major advantage of the flexible tool concept is increased depth of cut precision. Furthermore, the use of a flexible tool enables the process to be robust against machine tool registration error, guide misalignment, and component inertial deflections. The process was implemented by fitting a 5 -axis micro-scale machine tool with a specially constructed micro-groove <b>cutting</b> <b>assembly.</b> Early, experiments using diamond-coated AFM probes as tools demonstrated process viability up to cutting speeds of 25 mm/min and chip formation at the sub-micron scale. However, AFM probe geometries proved too fragile for this demanding application. High quality tools with improved cutting geometries were designed and fabricated via focused ion beam machining of single-crystal diamond tool blanks, and tool edge radii of 50 - 64 nm were achieved. The improved tools enabled well-formed rectangular grooves to be cut in aluminum at up to 400 mm/min with widths of 300 nm to 1. 05 microns and depths up to 2 microns. Complex compound v-shaped grooves were also produced. Virtually no tool wear (less than 20 nm) was observed over a cutting distance of 122. 4 mm. Small amounts of side burr formation occurred during steady-state cutting, and exit burr formation occurred when a tool exited from a workpiece. Parallel 1. 05 micron wide grooves were controllably cut as close as 1. 0 micron apart, and machining of intersecting grooves was successfully demonstrated. 	 To better understand process mechanics including chip formation, side burr formation, and exit burr formation at the small size scale involved, a 3 D finite element model of the process was developed. Validation with experimental results showed that on average the model predicted side burr height to within 2. 8 %, chip curl to within 4. 1 %, and chip thickness to within 25. 4 %. An important finding is that side burr formation is primarily caused ahead of a tool by expansion of material compressed after starting to flow around a tool rather than becoming part of a chip. Also, three exit burrs, two on the sides of a groove and one on the bottom of a groove, are formed when a thin membrane of material forms ahead of a tool and then ruptures as the tool exits a workpiece. Finally, conclusions about the process are drawn and recommendations for future work are presented...|$|E

Accuracy of bone <b>cutting</b> and osseous <b>assembly</b> has not yet been documented. This paper presents an experimental study on plastic bones, with experienced surgeons working under ideal conditions.

40|$|Metal cutting {{is today}} {{one of the}} leading forming {{processes}} in the manufacturing industry. The metal cutting industry houses several actors providing machine tools and cutting tools with a fierce competition as a consequence. Extensive efforts are made to improve the performance of both machine tools and cutting tools. Performance improvements are not solely restricted to produce stronger and more durable machine tools and cutting tools. They also include knowledge about how the machine tools and cutting tools should be used to perform at an optimum of their combined capacity. Information about the dynamic properties of the machine tool <b>cutting</b> tool <b>assembly</b> is one of the aspects that carries the most potential in terms of productivity increase and process reliability. This work presents a methodology to synthesise the dynamic behaviour of a machine tool and <b>cutting</b> tool <b>assembly</b> based on component models of the machine tool and the cutting tool. The system is treated as an assembly of subcomponents in order to reduce measurement effort. The target is to get the receptance {{at the tip of the}} machine tool/cutting tool which is a prerequisite for process analysis and optimisation. This methodology is compared with today's state-of-the-art methodology which require experimental testing for each cutting tool of interests mounted in the machine tool. Comparisons are also made with previous attempts to utilize component synthesis in this matter. The subcomponent approach presented here limits the experimental tests to the machine tool component. The machine tool component model is connected to a model representation, based on a finite element model of the cutting tool. The subcomponent models are obtained and coupled on state-space form, a technique that is new to the application of component synthesis of machine tool/cutting tool structures. Proposed procedures for measurements, system identification, enforcement of physical properties on state-space models and parameter influences on coupled results are presented, implemented and validated.
