40|$|Modeling {{in general}} {{can be viewed}} as a two-step process, the first being concept {{visualization}} followed by the final design. Most designers who work with CAD systems go through the concept visualization stage and follow the same steps required in the final design stage. A standard approach to concept visualization is traditionally performed using <b>clay</b> <b>modeling,</b> yet there is a lack of computer aided design tools that can faithfully mimic the process of traditional <b>clay</b> <b>modeling</b> both in terms of representation of virtual clay as well as an immersive user interface capable of capturing the user’s intent in an intuitive sense. In this paper we describe a voxel based representation of virtual clay and introduce a hierarchical gestural interface using Kinect which together brings the intuitiveness of traditional <b>clay</b> <b>modeling</b> to a CAD environment. The framework was validated using a 3 D <b>clay</b> <b>modeling</b> software (n= 13). Results showed that most of the participants were able to adapt to the new interface quickly...|$|R
