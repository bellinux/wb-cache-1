5|$|The Wii system {{supports}} wireless <b>connectivity</b> with the Nintendo DS without any additional accessories. This <b>connectivity</b> allows the player {{to use the}} Nintendo DS microphone and touchscreen as inputs for Wii games. The first game utilizing Nintendo DS-Wii <b>connectivity</b> is Pokémon Battle Revolution. Players with either the Pokémon Diamond or Pearl Nintendo DS games are able to play battles using the Nintendo DS as a controller. , released on both Nintendo DS and Wii, features <b>connectivity</b> in which both games can advance simultaneously. Nintendo later released the Nintendo Channel, which allows Wii owners to download game demos or additional data to their Nintendo DS in a process {{similar to that of}} a DS Download Station. The console is also able to expand Nintendo DS games.|$|E
5|$|The {{device is}} {{available}} {{with either a}} black or white front glass panel and various <b>connectivity</b> and storage options.

5|$|<b>Connectivity</b> to the Game Boy Advance was {{discussed}} {{as an opportunity}} among the developers, but they eventually agreed that Double Dash!! was not suited to these <b>connectivity</b> ideas and decided to exclude it. It was desirable to narrow down {{the gap between the}} ability of veteran and novice players. Therefore, gameplay features like the ability to escape the banana were removed; the staff wanted both veteran and novice players to enjoy themselves.|$|E

40|$|Chimera {{states are}} complex spatiotemporal {{patterns}} consisting of coexisting domains of coherence and incoherence. We study networks of nonlocally coupled logistic maps and analyze systematically how the dilution {{of the network}} links influences the appearance of chimera patterns. The network <b>connectivities</b> are constructed using an iterative Cantor algorithm to generate fractal (hierarchical) <b>connectivities.</b> Increasing the hierarchical level of iteration, we compare the resulting spatiotemporal patterns. We demonstrate that a high clustering coefficient and symmetry of the base pattern promotes chimera states, and asymmetric <b>connectivities</b> result in complex nested chimera patterns...|$|R

5|$|Google and Asus omitted {{cellular}} <b>connectivity</b> on initial {{models of}} the device, instead employing Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n as the only means for the tablet to connect to the Internet. A mobile-capable version of the device utilizing HSPA+ cellular technology with 32 GB of storage was later introduced in October 2012 for $299. Unlike most tablets, the Nexus7 has NFC <b>connectivity</b> built in, which allows users to share files quickly with Android Beam and perform non-touch payments at sites that employ NFC cash registers.|$|E
5|$|In the US and Canada, nine {{variations}} of the third-generation iPad were offered, compared to six {{in the rest of}} the world, although some countries had only the Wi-Fi only model. Each variation was available with black or white front glass panels, with options for 16, 32, or 64GB of storage. In North America, <b>connectivity</b> options were Wi-Fi only, Wi-Fi + 4G (LTE) on Verizon, AT, Telus, Rogers, or Bell. For the rest of the world outside North America, <b>connectivity</b> options are Wi-Fi only (on the Wi-Fi model) or Wi-Fi + 3G (on the Wi-Fi + Cellular model), with the latter unavailable in some countries, as 4G (LTE) <b>connectivity</b> for the device is not available outside North America. The Wi-Fi + Cellular model includes GPS capability.|$|E
40|$|The {{average ground}} state energy and entropy for +/- J spin glasses on Bethe lattices of <b>connectivities</b> k+ 1 = 3 [...] ., 26 at T= 0 are {{approximated}} numerically. To obtain sufficient accuracy for large system sizes (up to n= 2048), the Extremal Optimization heuristic is employed which provides high-quality results {{not only for}} the ground state energies per spin e_{k+ 1 } but also for their entropies s_{k+ 1 }. The results show considerable quantitative differences between lattices of even and odd <b>connectivities.</b> The results for the ground state energies compare very well with recent one-step replica symmetry breaking calculations. These energies can be scaled for all even <b>connectivities</b> k+ 1 to within a fraction of a percent onto a simple functional form, e_{k+ 1 } = E_{SK} sqrt(k+ 1) - { 2 E_{SK}+sqrt(2) } / sqrt(k+ 1), where E_{SK} = - 0. 7633 is the ground state energy for the broken replica symmetry in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. But this form is in conflict with perturbative calculations at large k+ 1, which do not distinguish between even and odd <b>connectivities.</b> We find non-zero entropies s_{k+ 1 } at small <b>connectivities.</b> While s_{k+ 1 } seems to vanish asymptotically with 1 /(k+ 1) for even <b>connectivities,</b> it is indistinguishable from zero already for odd k+ 1 >= 9.

5|$|The Nintendo DS (NDS) {{features}} a touch screen and built-in microphone, and supports wireless IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) standards. Additionally, the {{revised version of}} the NDS, the Nintendo DSi, features two built in cameras, the ability to download games from the DSi store, and a web browser. The PlayStation Portable (PSP) released later the same year on December 12, 2004, followed a different pattern. It became the first handheld video game console to use an optical disc format, Universal Media Disc (UMD), as its primary storage media. Sony also gave the PSP robust multi-media capability, <b>connectivity</b> with the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2 (only on some games), other PSPs, as well as Internet <b>connectivity.</b> The Nintendo DS likewise had <b>connectivity</b> to the internet through the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and Nintendo DS Browser, as well as wireless <b>connectivity</b> to other DS systems and Wii consoles. Despite high sales numbers for both consoles, PlayStation Portable sales have consistently lagged behind those of the Nintendo DS; nevertheless, the PlayStation Portable has {{the distinction of being}} the best-selling non-Nintendo handheld gaming system.|$|E
