40|$|Metal matrix {{composites}} {{are well}} known materials that present several positive features, mainly in terms of mechanical strength to weight ratio. On the other side, MMC’s are extremely difficult to machine (in particular <b>by</b> <b>chip</b> <b>removal</b> processes) and this difficulty has limited a wider diffusion. Welding, together with other joining technologies, could be a solution to limit the <b>chip</b> <b>removal</b> processes {{in the production of}} a MMC part, {{but this is not a}} problem-free process. This paper presents an experimental study on the laser welding of MMCs using both a CO 2 and a diode laser source. The CO 2 welding is performed in keyhole conditions (deep penetration), whereas the diode laser performs a conduction welding. Results show that the CO 2 welding is greatly affected by the formation of Al 4 C 3, that compromises the toughness of the bead. The content of Al 4 C 3 can be reduced by acting on the process parameters, but cannot be completely eliminated. Instead, diode laser welding generates a sound bead, with negligible Al 4 C 3 formation and of superior quality. Considering also the other positive features of this kind of sources (high efficiency and radiation wavelength, that is, highly absorbed by MMCs), diode laser welding seems to be highly recommendable for MMCs laser welding...|$|R
30|$|For {{very large}} myomas, we will {{possibly}} {{need to improve}} our blade system because at present the IBS® has still some drawbacks. Compared to other blind intrauterine applications, the IBS® has the major advantage that surgeons always perform the procedure under visual control, with automated and easy <b>removal</b> of tissue <b>chips.</b> Very interesting is that the IBS® is able to resect also myomatous tissue, making this a very promising alternative to the resectoscope. In fact surgery is not interrupted <b>by</b> tissue <b>chips</b> <b>removal,</b> making total operating time shorter. It is further postulated that resection of myomas {{without the use of}} electrical current could significantly reduce the postoperative adhesion formation and that the IBS® should preferentially be used in younger women in their reproductive age [7].|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{observed}} that the lubrication effect {{is greater than the}} cooling effect for decreasing the friction heat in face grinding. It was clarified that cool-air grinding is difficult to apply to face grinding under the present grinding conditions. We could obtain the minimum ground surface roughness (hereafter noted as surface roughness) at a mist suppｌy volume of 15 to 30 ml/h in mist grinding. The largest stock removal rate (hereafter noted as grinding efficiency) is obtained in mist grinding. However, grinding efficient was small in cool-air mist grinding, by which a large cooling effect of cool air was expected. Though mist and cool-air mist grinding perform similar to wet grinding in few grinding passes, wet grinding is properly applied <b>by</b> large <b>chip</b> <b>removal</b> action in many grinding passes...|$|R

40|$|The main aim of {{this work}} was the {{machining}} by hard turning of surfaces with optical surface quality. A numerical target had been set as a surface roughness Ra = 10 nm. It {{has been shown that}} achieving roughness of that magnitude by hard turning is possible. Individual work pieces exhibited the desired surface properties for short lengths at a time, but it proved {{to be very difficult to}} achieve these surfaces consistently and over longer cuts. The factors influencing the surface roughness were identified as tool defects and machine vibration in addition to the standard cutting parameters and choice of cutting tool. A model of surface generation in hard turning has been developed and good correlation between simulated and experimentally determined surface roughnesses was achieved. By introducing a material partition equation which determines the proportional contribution of material removal mechanisms in the undeformed chip a comprehensive method for assessing the contributing factors in material removal was developed. While it has been shown that surfaces in hard turning are almost exclusively generated <b>by</b> <b>chip</b> <b>removal</b> and plastic deformation the developed model is versatile enough to include elastic deformation of the work piece. With the help of the model of surface generation in hard turning it has been possible to attribute magnitudes of the influencing factors with respect to the cutting parameters such as feed rate and tool corner radius, and the main disturbances - tool defects and machine vibration. From this conclusions were drawn on the requirements for machine tools and cutting tools, which will need to be realised to make ultra-precision hard turning of surfaces of optical quality a feasible manufacturing process.

40|$|Abstract. Recent {{developments}} in grinding {{have opened up}} new avenues for finishing of hard and brittle materials with nano-surface finish, high tolerance and accuracy. Grinding with superabrasive wheels is {{an excellent way to}} produce ultra-precision surface finish. However, superabrasive diamond grits need higher bond-ing strength while grinding, which metal-bonded grinding wheels can offer. Truing and dressing of the wheels are major problems and they tend to glaze because of wheel loading. When grinding with superabrasive wheels, wheel loading can be avoided by dressing periodically to obtain continuous grinding. Electrolytic in-process dressing (ELID) is the most suitable process for dressing metal-bonded grinding wheels during the grinding process. Nano-surface finish can be achieved only when <b>chip</b> <b>removal</b> is done at the atomic level. Recent developments of ductile mode machining of hard and brittle materials show that plastically deformed <b>chip</b> <b>removal</b> minimizes the subsurface damage of the workpiece. When chip deforma-tion takes place in the ductile regime, a defect-free nano-surface is possible and it completely eliminates the polishing process. ELID is one of the processes used for atomic level metal removal and nano-surface finish. However, no proper and detailed studies have been carried out to clarify the fundamental characteristics for making this process a robust one. Consequently, an attempt has been made in this study to understand the fundamental characteristics of ELID grinding and their influence on surface finish...|$|R
