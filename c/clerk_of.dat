5|$|Before {{the reign}} of Henry VIII, the {{sovereign}} always granted his or her assent in person. The sovereign, wearing the Imperial State Crown, would be seated on the throne in the Lords chamber, surrounded by heralds {{and members of the}} royal court—a scene that nowadays is repeated only at the annual State Opening of Parliament. The Commons, led by their speaker, would listen from the Bar of the Lords, just outside the chamber. The <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> the Parliaments presented the bills awaiting assent to the monarch, save that supply bills were traditionally brought up by the speaker. The <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> the Crown, standing on the sovereign's right, then read aloud the titles of the bills (in earlier times, the entire text of the bills). The <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> the Parliaments, standing on the sovereign's left, responded by stating the appropriate Norman French formula.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his return}} from the war to his {{hometown}} of Romney in June 1865, White was unable to recommence his practice of law or hold a public office due to the existing state laws of the Constitution of West Virginia which disbarred former Confederate States government and military personnel. White's situation was further complicated, as {{he had not been}} pardoned or paroled by the United States for his service in the Confederate States Army. White rented a farm in Hampshire County and engaged in successful agricultural pursuits until the disenfranchisement of former Confederates was struck from the state's constitution in 1872. In 1872, White was elected to the position of <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> Court for Hampshire County and began his term the following year in 1873. During his tenure as <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> Court for Hampshire County, White also served one term as <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> the Circuit Court between 1873 and 1876, but declined to run for a second term in that office. Prior to the American Civil War, White's father John Baker White had also served as the county's <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> Court for 47 years between 1815 and 1861. White served as <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> Court for Hampshire County for 29 years until 1902. He and his father served in the position a combined total of 76 years.
