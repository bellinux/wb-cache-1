Avoid the common and coarser kinds (fuci) which cover the surface of the rocks; for they give out under water a slime which will foul your tank: but choose the more {{delicate}} species which fringe the edges of every pool at low-water mark; the pink coralline, the dark purple ragged dulse (Rhodymenia), the <b>Carrageen</b> moss (Chondrus), and above all, the commonest of all, the delicate green Ulva, which you will see growing everywhere in wrinkled fan-shaped sheets, as thin as the finest silver-paper. [...] The smallest bits of stone are sufficient, provided the sea-weeds have hold of them; for they have no real roots, but adhere by a small disc, deriving no nourishment from the rock, but only from the water. Take care, meanwhile, that there be as little as possible on the stone, beside the weed itself. Especially scrape off any small sponges, and see that no worms have made their twining tubes of sand among the weed-stems; if they have, drag them out; for they will surely die, and as surely spoil all by sulphuretted hydrogen, blackness, and evil smells.|$|E

In traditional medicine {{it has been}} used as analgesic, relieving headache, cold remedy, antipyretic and diuretic. Since until now this plant has not been investigated pharacologically. This study was aimed to find any anti-inflammatory or analgesic activity of the plant. &# 13; Methods. At first, total extract, flavonoid fraction and volatile oil was prepared. Analgesic effect was assessed using light tail flick and acetic acid writhing test. Male wistar rats (180 - 220 g) and mice (25 ± 2 g) were used in these tests. <b>Carrageen</b> in test was used for assessing anti-inflammatory activity. &# 13; Results. Total extract and flavonoid fraction could not produce analgesic effect in light tail flick test, while morphine as a standard drug 15 and 30 min. after administration produced 35 % and 90 % of MPE respectively. In writhing test, total extract and flavonoid fraction had considerable analgesic effect which was comparable to that of indomethacin. Results of Carageenin test showed that both total extract and flavonoid fraction had marked anti-inflammatory activity and volatile oil had only a slight effect. &# 13; Discussion. Since potent drugs (such as opioids) show positive response to light tail flick test, it seems that the plant lacks such compounds. Considerable analgesic activity of total extract and flavonoid fraction in writhing test and also their anti-inflammatory activity indicate that this plant is probably useful for relieving pains, particularly with inflammatory origin...|$|E
40|$|Background. Zataria multiflora Boiss is an Iranian {{medicinal}} plant from lamiaceae family. It {{could be found}} in central and southern regions of Iran. Several pharmacological effects such as antimicrobial, antifungal, antiseizure and anti-inflammatory effects have been reported for this plant but only its antifungal effects has been studied yet. Flavonoids and the essential oil are the most important constituents of this plant. In this study the possible anti-inflammatory effect of its total extract, the essential oil and flavonoid fractions were examined in <b>carrageen</b> an (CAR) test. &# 13; Methods. Male Wistar rats weighing 180 - 220 g in groups of 6 were used. CAR was injected in sub plantar surface of right (10 mg/ml, 0. 1 ml) paw of rats and the inflammation was measured 3 hrs later by plethysmograph. Dexamethasone (1 mg/kg. ip) was used as standard. &# 13; Results. All fractions of the plant including total extract (900 mg/kg p. o, 500 mg/kg i. p.), flavonoid (900 mg/kg p. o and i. p) and the essential oil had significant preventive effect on CAR-induced rat paw edema. In contrast to indomethacin (positive control) both total extract and the essential oil did not show any ulcerogenic effect on rat stomach. &# 13; Discussion. Thus, this plant has a significant anti-inflammatory effect which in part is due to its flavonoids and the essential oil but other active substances of the plant could be involved. The lack of ulcerogenic effects is its important advantage.

An indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (IC-ELISA) was developed with a working range of 0. 025 - 10 μg ml- 1 using a monoclonal antibody raised against purified Hsp 70 of Phaseolus aureus (mung bean). Fucus serratus (toothed wrack), Chondrus crispus (Stackhouse or <b>Carrageen</b> moss), Ulva lactuca (sea lettuce) and Lemna minor (common duckweed) sample extracts were stressed for up to 24 h and then tested in the IC-ELISA. The presence of Hsp 70 and cross-reactivity of the monoclonal antibody was confirmed by Western blot. The heat shock response was confirmed in each species using a 2 -h 42 °C treatment. Following heat shock, Hsp 70 concentrations increased to a peak at 2 h (F. serratus) or 4 h (L. minor), after which concentrations decreased. Osmotic and cadmium stresses also resulted in elevated Hsp 70 concentrations in samples of F. serratus and L. minor when compared with unstressed controls. In both, osmotic and metal stress, the production of Hsp 70 increased to a maximum and subsequently decreased as the stressor levels increased. Results suggest that Hsp 70 IC-ELISA could potentially be applied to the detection of stress in these aquatic species, although it would probably be most effective when used in conjunction with other measurements to provide a stressor-specific biomarker profile or fingerprint...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the bioinformatic {{analysis}} and annotation of the genome of the marine planctomycete Rhodopirellula baltica. A comprehensive bioinformatic pipeline was set up and established that comprises gene prediction, annotation and visualization tools. Considerable effort was put into the manual annotation process. The annotation of the genome of Rhodopirellula baltica revealed that this organism is specialized on the aerobic degradation of complex carbohydrates. Its genome harbors 110 sulfatases, which are likely excreted {{to get access to}} the carbon skeletons of sulfated heteropolysaccharides like chondroitin sulfate or <b>carrageen.</b> Phylogenetic analysis of numerous marker genes from the genome support a relationship with the Chlamydia or at least an affiliation with the Chlamydia-Spirochaetes superclade. This is in agreement with earlier 16 S rRNA-based analysis and contradicts the recently proposed deepest branching position of the Planctomycetes within the bacterial domain. The presence of many genes for peptidoglycan biosynthesis indicates that the proteinaceous cell envelopes of planctomycetes are secondary adaptions rather than a relict from a time preceding peptidoglycan cell walls. This is also consistent with findings that suggest that the Planctomycetes originated from organisms with Gram negative-type cell envelopes (e. g. genes for lipid A biosynthesis) and that the outer ribosome-free compartments of Planctomycetes descended from a former periplasmic space. Two spin-off projects from the annotation of the Rhodopirellula baltica genome have lead to independent software developments. The first is MORFind, a flexible and extensible meta-tool for the in silico prediction of protein-coding genes. The second is a method for the probability-based assignment of genomic fragments originating from metagenome projects that is based on skewed tetranucleotide distributions. A dedicated program named TETRA has been developed for this purpose...|$|E

After animal death, specimens were taken, routinely cut and stained with HE, Sirius Red, and Toluidine Blue. Descriptive analysis of components of the TMJ was done. The synovial cell layers were counted. Results: Injection of saline did not produced inflammatory reaction and the irradiated groups did not present differences compared to nonirradiated ones. After carrageenan injection, intense inflammatory infiltration and synovial cell layers proliferation were observed. The infrared irradiated group presented less inflammation and less synovial cell layers number compared to other groups. Previous laser irradiation did not improve the results. Conclusion: It was concluded that the LPT presented positive effects on inflammatory infiltration reduction and accelerated the inflammation process, mainly with IR laser irradiation. The number of synovial cell layers was reduced on irradiated group...|$|E
