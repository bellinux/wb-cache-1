5|$|After initial cutting, {{the diamond}} is shaped in {{numerous}} stages of polishing. Unlike cutting, {{which is a}} responsible but quick operation, polishing removes material by gradual erosion and is extremely time consuming. The associated technique is well developed; it is <b>considered</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> routine and can be performed by technicians. After polishing, the diamond is reexamined for possible flaws, either remaining or induced by the process. Those flaws are concealed through various diamond enhancement techniques, such as repolishing, crack filling, or clever arrangement of the stone in the jewelry. Remaining non-diamond inclusions are removed through laser drilling and filling of the voids produced.|$|E
