40|$|Iron ores {{containing}} ferrous {{minerals and}} sulphide minerals are specifically as several times active in microwave. Pyrolysis {{of the coal}} usually requires iron minerals for activation step to both absorption microwave from the matrix of the sulphides and conduct the heat to coal for pyrolysis. In this investigation, the <b>copper</b> <b>pyrite</b> and coal pyrite was microwave roasted to oxidize both the sulphides and even the pyrolysis of coal for reduction iron oxide. The effects were investigated by gravimetric and infrared analysis and the microwave absorption characteristics were quantified by determining the permittivities. The microwave heating behaviour studies showed that the sample temperature increased with increasing incident microwave power, processing time and sample mass. Due to {{the activity of the}} iron ore to the microwaves, a low incident power of 600 W was found to be sufficient for roasting, as higher powers resulted in sintering and melting of the concentrate. The <b>copper</b> <b>pyrite</b> weight loss values after roasting were over 25 % and these were similar to those obtained by conventional roasting. The main advantages of microwave roasting were that both the total pyrolysis rates and the heating rates were higher and the specific energy consumptions were lower than in coal pyrite.

40|$|Abstract. This study {{aimed to}} obtain {{volatile}} copper from a high-copper pyrite cinder by optimizing the chloridizing roasting process using response surface methodology (RSM). The effect of key parameters, i. e., dosage of CaCl 2 addition, roasting time and roasting temperature, on the copper volatile ratio was investigated and a quadratic model was {{suggested by the}} methodology to correlate the variables to this volatile ratio. The {{results indicated that the}} model was in good agreement with the experimental data at a correlation coefficient (R 2) of 0. 9782, and the most influential parameter on efficiency was identified as the dosage of CaCl 2 addition. The optimum conditions for chloridizing roasting from the high <b>copper</b> <b>pyrite</b> cinder were identified as a dosage of CaCl 2 addition of 4. 8 wt%, a roasting time of 19. 28 min and a roasting temperature of 1151. 51 °C; under such conditions, a copper volatile ratio of 97. 82 % was achieved.

40|$|Microflotation, {{laboratory}} batch, {{and continuous}} in-plant minicell {{tests were conducted}} to determine if copper ions not only activate sphalerite but also depress pyrite when the minerals are together. Microflotation was performed on mineral samples over a pH range of 3. 5 [...] 11. It was found that pyrite recovery increased with addition of copper ions when alone, but decreased by more than 25 % (absolute) when sphalerite was also present for the pH range 6 [...] 9. 5. Bench flotation tests were performed on Louvicourt Mine ore and Red Dog Mine ore. The results for Red Dog showed that upon addition of <b>copper,</b> <b>pyrite</b> recovery decreased significantly. Pyrite recovery decreased from ca. 70 % (no copper) to ca. 10 % (4. 5 g Cu/kg Zn) at a sphalerite recovery of ca. 70 %.
