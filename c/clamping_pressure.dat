40|$|As {{a result}} of climate change a large {{reduction}} of agricultural water through improved irrigation management is a major need for agriculture sustainability. To this aim, always more sensitive sensors to monitor plant water status have been developed in recent years. Among them, the leaf patch <b>clamp</b> <b>pressure</b> probes are very promising for water management of olive but until now have been tested only in few environmental and management conditions. In this work these sensors have been tested for two consecutive years on two completely different management systems: a traditional rainfed orchard and a super high density (SHD) drip irrigated orchard. Within the SHD orchard the probes have been installed on two different genotypes characterize by different vigor and productive potential. Stem water potential and gases exchange have been measured at regular intervals and used as reference to detect water status of the trees. The high correlation observed between the leaf patch <b>clamp</b> <b>pressure</b> probes and Ψswp, independently from the year and the treatment, confirmed the high potential of the continuous system. The inversion of the daily curve of the leaf patch <b>clamp</b> <b>pressure</b> probes reading was observed when Ψswp decreased under the value of − 2. 2 /− 2. 5  MPa suggesting the possibility to use this indicator to detect high water stress levels. Anyway, considering that at this level of stress the plants had already strongly reduced the gas exchanges by 40 – 50 % {{with respect to their}} values at Ψswp above − 2  MPa, with consequence on carbohydrate production that can affect productivity, rise the need to find other indicators that enable to differentiate water status at lower stress levels.

40|$|A high-precision {{pressure}} probe {{is described}} which allows non-invasive online-monitoring {{of the water}} relations of intact leaves. Real-time recording of the leaf water status occurred by data transfer to an Internet server. The leaf patch <b>clamp</b> <b>pressure</b> probe measures the attenuated pressure, Pp, of a leaf patch {{in response to a}} constant <b>clamp</b> <b>pressure,</b> Pclamp. Pp is sensed by a miniaturized silicone pressure sensor integrated into the device. The magnitude of Pp is dictated by the transfer function of the leaf, Tf, which is a function of leaf patch volume and ultimately of cell turgor pressure, Pc, as shown theoretically. The power function Tf=f(Pc) theoretically derived was experimentally confirmed by concomitant Pp and Pc measurements on intact leaflets of the liana Tetrastigma voinierianum under greenhouse conditions. Simultaneous Pp recordings on leaflets up to 10 m height above ground demonstrated that changes in Tf induced by Pc changes due to changes of microclimate and/or of the irrigation regime were sensitively reflected in corresponding changes of Pp. Analysis of the data show that transpirational water loss during the morning hours was associated with a transient rise in turgor pressure gradients within the leaflets. Subsequent recovery of turgescence during the afternoon was much faster than the preceding transpiration-induced water loss if the plants were well irrigated.

However, {{in the afternoon}} the relative changes of cell turgor of the transpiring leaves displayed a delayed response in comparison to plant water uptake.

40|$|Turgor {{pressure}} {{provides a}} sensitive indicator for irrigation scheduling. Leaf turgor pressure of Musa acuminate {{was measured by}} using the so-called leaf patch <b>clamp</b> <b>pressure</b> probe, i. e. by application of an external, magnetically generated and constantly retained <b>clamp</b> <b>pressure</b> to a leaf patch and determination of the attenuated output pressure P p that is highly correlated with the turgor pressure. Real-time recording of P p values was made using wireless telemetric transmitters, which send the data to a receiver base station where data are logged and transferred to a GPRS modem linked to an Internet server. Probes functioned over several months under field and laboratory conditions without damage to the leaf patch. Measurements showed that the magnetic-based probe could monitor very sensitively changes in turgor pressure induced by changes in microclimate (temperature, relative humidity, irradiation and wind) and irrigation. Irrigation effects could clearly be distinguished from environmental effects. Interestingly, oscillations in stomatal aperture, which occurred frequently below turgor pressures of 100 kPa towards noon at high transpiration or at high wind speed, were reflected in the P p values. The period of pressure oscillations was comparable with the period of oscillations in transpiration and photosynthesis. Multiple probe readings on individual leaves and/or on several leaves over the entire height of the plants further emphasised the great impact of this non-invasive turgor pressure sensor system for elucidating the dynamics of short- and long-distance water transport in higher plants...|$|R
40|$|Real-time {{monitoring}} of plant water status {{under field conditions}} remains difficult to quantify. Here we give evidence that the magnetic-based leaf patch <b>clamp</b> <b>pressure</b> (LPCP) probe is a non-invasive and online-measuring method that can elucidate short- and long-term temporal and spatial dynamics of leaf water status of trees with high precision in real time. Measurements were controlled remotely by telemetry and data transfer to the Internet. Concomitant measurements using the pressure chamber technique (frequently applied for leaf water status monitoring) showed that both techniques yield in principle the same results despite of the high sampling variability of the pressure chamber data. There {{was a very good}} correlation between the output pressure signals of the LPCP probe and the balancing pressure values (on average r 2 Â =Â  0. 90 Â Â±Â  0. 05; nÂ =Â  8), i. e. the external pressure at which water appears at the cut end of a leaf under pressure chamber conditions. Simultaneously performed direct measurements of leaf cell turgor pressure using the well-established cell turgor pressure probe technique evidenced that both techniques measure relative changes in leaf turgor pressure. The output pressure signals of the LPCP probe and the balancing pressure values were inversely correlated to turgor pressure. Consistent with this, the balancing pressure values and the cell turgor pressure values could be fitted quite well by the same firm theoretical backing derived recently for the LPCP probe (Zimmermann et al., 2008). This finding suggests that use of the LPCP probe technique in agricultural water management can be built up on the knowledge accumulated on spot leaf or stem water potential measurements.
