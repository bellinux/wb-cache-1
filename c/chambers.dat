Bullock proposed that the matter be dropped, but Bibb insisted that <b>Chambers</b> would have to retract his challenge, to which Bullock would not consent. The duel was held February 3, 1801, near Bardstown. Both combatants missed with their first shots. Both men fired again, and Rowan's second shot struck <b>Chambers,</b> wounding him severely. (Bibb's account says that <b>Chambers</b> was struck in the left side; other accounts state that the shot hit <b>Chambers</b> in the chest.) Rowan then offered his carriage to take <b>Chambers</b> to town for medical attention, and <b>Chambers</b> asked that Rowan not be prosecuted. Despite medical aid, <b>Chambers</b> died the following day.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} Holocaust during World War II, German Nazis used gas vans at Chelmno {{extermination}} camp and elsewhere to kill an estimated over 700,000 prisoners by carbon monoxide poisoning.

Gassing with carbon monoxide started in action T4, the euthanasia programme developed by the Nazis in Germany to murder the mentally ill and disabled people before the war started in earnest.

Promoters did not invite him to key athletics events, Eddie Kulukundis – who had supported <b>Chambers</b> earlier in his career – refused to sponsor the sprinter, and the British Olympic Association (BOA), prevented him from competing in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. To return to the track <b>Chambers</b> {{had to rely on}} the money he received from his partner, Leonie Daley, a civil servant whom he met at the Miss Jamaica UK competition. The couple now had a child, a boy named Skye who was born in September 2005, and <b>Chambers</b> desperately needed to earn a living to support his family and pay off debts incurred through the drug ban.
