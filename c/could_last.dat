5|$|An {{elaborate}} {{series of}} foundation rituals preceded construction. A further set of rituals followed the temple's completion, dedicating {{it to its}} patron god. These rites were conducted, at least in theory, by the king {{as part of his}} religious duties; indeed, in Egyptian belief all temple construction was symbolically his work. In reality, it was the work of hundreds of his subjects, conscripted in the corvée system. The construction process for a new temple, or a major addition to an existing one, <b>could</b> <b>last</b> years or decades.|$|E
5|$|Following post-storm surveys, it was {{determined}} that most of the severely damaged schools were built improperly and the upper-floors were not designed to bear typhoon-force winds. According to building codes in Thailand, structures are mandated to be able to withstand up to 120kgf/m2 of pressure from winds. In the years following the typhoon, studies by engineers were conducted in the hardest hit regions to determine how to best rebuild structures in the country. With many of the destroyed structures being constructed from wood, reinforced concrete structures were the suggested replacement. The new buildings <b>could</b> <b>last</b> up to 50 years with proper construction; however, sub-standard building would result in a need for repairs within five years.|$|E

5|$|Its major {{components}} were a spaceplane orbiter with an external fuel tank and two solid-fuel launch rockets at its side. The external tank, which {{was bigger than}} the spacecraft itself, was the only major component that was not reused. The shuttle could orbit in altitudes of 185–643km (115–400 miles) and carry a maximum payload (to low orbit) of 24,400kg (54,000lb). Missions <b>could</b> <b>last</b> from 5 to 17 days and crews could be from 2 to 8 astronauts.|$|E
5|$|Palestinian {{culture and}} life {{revolves}} around food in every aspect, {{whether it is}} an ordinary day or a special occasion such as a wedding or holiday. Meals are structured in a cyclical order by Palestinians and span into two main courses and several intermediate ones like coffee, fruits and sweets as well as dinner. Like in most Arab cultures, meals are a {{time to spend with}} family and <b>could</b> <b>last</b> 1–2 hours depending on the specific time of the day. Unlike other cultures, lunch is the primary course and breakfast and dinner are lighter in contents.|$|E
5|$|The Northern Celestial Masters {{followed}} certain regular, communal rites. One {{of these}} communal rites involved formal banquets. These feasts <b>could</b> <b>last</b> {{as long as}} seven days. In order to purify themselves for feasts, members had to abstain from eating meat, garlic, green onions, ginger, leeks and onions. A banquet consisted of three courses – wine, rice and a vegetarian meal. Ritual activity during feasts and other activities usually involved a series of bows and prostrations {{as well as the}} burning of incense. Banquets were also held when someone died. During these banquets, attendees would perform rituals aimed at remitting the sins of the deceased.|$|E

5|$|Although {{these acts}} helped empower courts to remedy {{violations}} of federal voting rights, strict legal standards {{made it difficult}} for the Department of Justice to successfully pursue litigation. For example, to win a discrimination lawsuit against a state that maintained a literacy test, the Department needed to prove that the rejected voter-registration applications of racial minorities were comparable to the accepted applications of whites. This involved comparing thousands of applications in each of the state's counties in a process that <b>could</b> <b>last</b> months. The Department's efforts were further hampered by resistance from local election officials, who would claim to have misplaced the voter registration records of racial minorities, remove registered racial minorities from the electoral rolls, and resign so that voter registration ceased. Moreover, the Department often needed to appeal lawsuits several times before the judiciary provided relief because many federal district court judges opposed racial minority suffrage. Thus, between 1957 and 1964, the African-American voter registration rate in the South improved marginally even though the Department litigated 71 voting rights lawsuits.|$|E
5|$|If it was {{necessary}} to seize control of a castle an army could either launch an assault or lay siege. It was more efficient to starve the garrison out than to assault it, particularly for the most heavily defended sites. Without relief from an external source, the defenders would eventually submit. Sieges <b>could</b> <b>last</b> weeks, months, and in rare cases years if the supplies of food and water were plentiful. A long siege could slow down the army, allowing help to come or for the enemy to prepare a larger force for later. Such an approach was not confined to castles, but was also applied to the fortified towns of the day. On occasion, siege castles would be built to defend the besiegers from a sudden sally and would have been abandoned after the siege ended one way or another.|$|E
5|$|Later that {{afternoon}} Allen {{decided to break}} contact and return to base, to avoid fighting a battle that <b>could</b> <b>last</b> until the evening. In the meantime, however, he called in air-strikes to inflict further damage on the base camp of his primary target, the 271st Regiment. That evening Brigadier General William Coleman and other senior officers of the 1st Infantry Division visited the 2nd Battalion's camp, where they praised Allen's men for their efforts, and presented First Lieutenant Clark Welch—commander of Delta Company—with a Silver Star for his actions earlier in the day. Allen then decided to launch a full-frontal attack against the 271st Regiment's base camp, {{to determine if the}} enemy unit was still there. However, {{due to the lack of}} sufficient manpower, Welch suggested that Allen should either call off the assault or get more soldiers on the ground for the operation. Allen dismissed Welch's suggestions, and responded by giving Captain James George—commander of Alpha Company—the responsibility of leading the attack instead of Welch.|$|E

5|$|The dragon man was {{believed}} to act similar to the mythological dragon: {{as soon as he}} saw bad weather approaching, which he knew was brought by an ala, he would leave whatever he was doing, and fly up to confront the demon. This he did by falling into a deep sleep, or entering a state similar to death, usually at the very spot where he happened to be at that time. His soul then left his body in the form of a snake or a lizard, and soared skywards. It was claimed that he was not breathing as long as his soul was absent from his body. The battle <b>could</b> <b>last</b> for a whole day, or even for several days, during which time the man lay unconscious, sweating profusely from the exertion of the fight. There was a danger that, during the course of the battle, the ala might approach the man's body and harm him, which could be prevented by someone swinging a blade above him, or by sticking the blade at the lying man's head. He should not be pushed or moved while in this state: if he was not in the same position as when he fell asleep, his soul would not be able to return into his body, and he would die. When he woke up after the battle with the ala, he was very tired. Apart from these characteristics, the dragon man was seen as an ordinary human.|$|E
5|$|Through {{much of the}} Middle Ages and Renaissance the Catholic Church {{had only}} a small number of {{cardinals}} at any one time, down to as few as seven under either Pope Alexander IV (1254-1261) or Pope John XXI (1276-1277). Difficult travel further reduced the number arriving at conclaves. With a small electorate an individual vote was significant, and was not easily shaken from familial or political lines. Conclaves <b>could</b> <b>last</b> months and even years. In addition to the decree in 1274 that the electors should be locked in seclusion, Gregory X also limited each cardinal elector to two servants, and rationed their food progressively on the fourth and ninth days should they fail to elect a new pope. The cardinals disliked these strict rules of the conclave; Pope Adrian V temporarily suspended them in 1276 and John XXI's Licet felicis recordationis formally revoked them later that same year - both these Popes had intended to promulgate a new constitution governing papal elections, but died before doing so. Lengthy elections resumed and continued to be the norm until 1294, when a Benedictine hermit was elected as Pope Celestine V. Celestine reinstated the strict conclave, but soon resigned the papacy. Long interregna occurred after the reinstatement of the conclave: in 1314–1316 during the Avignon Papacy, where the original conclaves were dispersed by besieging mercenaries and not reconvened until almost two years had passed; and in 1415–1417, as a result of the Western Schism.|$|E
