5|$|Many fixed-speed {{motor load}} {{applications}} that are supplied direct from AC line power can save energy {{when they are}} operated at variable speed by means of VFD. Such energy cost savings are especially pronounced in variable-torque <b>centrifugal</b> <b>fan</b> and pump applications, where the load's torque and power vary with the square and cube, respectively, of the speed. This change gives a large power reduction compared to fixed-speed operation for a relatively small reduction in speed. For example, at 63% speed a motor load consumes only 25% of its full-speed power. This reduction is in accordance with affinity laws that define the relationship between various centrifugal load variables.|$|E
25|$|Another type of {{vertical}} axis is the Parallel turbine, {{which is similar}} to the crossflow fan or <b>centrifugal</b> <b>fan.</b> It uses the ground effect. Vertical axis turbines of this type have been tried for many years: a unit producing 10kW was built by Israeli wind pioneer Bruce Brill in the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Cubic {{feet per}} minute (CFM) is an often {{confusing}} term {{because it has}} no single definition that applies to all instances. Gases are compressible, which means that a figure in cubic feet per minute cannot necessarily be compared with another figure when it comes {{the mass of the}} gas. To further confuse the issue, a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>fan</b> is a constant CFM device or a constant volume device. This means that, provided the fan speed remains constant, a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>fan</b> will pump a constant volume of air. This {{is not the same as}} pumping a constant mass of air. Again, the fan will pump the same volume, though not mass, at any other air density. This means that the air velocity in a system is the same even though mass flow rate through the fan is not.|$|E

50|$|<b>Centrifugal</b> <b>fans</b> use the {{kinetic energy}} of the {{impellers}} to increase {{the volume of the}} air stream, which in turn moves them against the resistance caused by ducts, dampers and other components. <b>Centrifugal</b> <b>fans</b> displace air radially, changing the direction (typically by 90°) of the airflow. They are sturdy, quiet, reliable, and capable of operating over a wide range of conditions.|$|R

25|$|Centrifugal {{compressors}} {{are also}} similar to centrifugal {{fans of the}} style shown in neighboring figure as they both increase the flows energy through increasing radius. In contrast to centrifugal fans, compressors operate at higher speeds to generate greater pressure rises. In many cases the engineering methods used to design a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>fan</b> {{are the same as}} those to design a centrifugal compressor. As a result, they can at times look very similar.|$|E
25|$|Instead of disks, {{most modern}} {{mechanical}} sirens use two concentric cylinders, which have slots parallel to their length. The inner cylinder rotates while the outer one remains stationary. As air under pressure flows {{out of the}} slots of the inner cylinder and then escapes through the slots of the outer cylinder, the flow is periodically interrupted, creating a tone. The earliest such sirens were developed during 1877–1880 by James Douglass and George Slight (1859–1934) of Trinity House; the final version was first installed in 1887 at the Ailsa Craig lighthouse in Scotland's Firth of Clyde. When commercial electric power became available, sirens were no longer driven by external sources of compressed air, but by electric motors, which generated the necessary flow of air via a simple <b>centrifugal</b> <b>fan,</b> which was incorporated into the siren’s inner cylinder.|$|E

500|$|At the time, Frost was {{particularly}} interested in jet engine design and {{ways to improve the}} efficiency of the compressor without sacrificing the simplicity of the turbine engine. He found Frank Whittle's [...] "reverse flow" [...] design too complex and was interested in ways to clean up the layout. This led him to design a new type of engine layout with the flame cans lying directly outside the outer rim of the centrifugal compressor, pointed outwards like the spokes on a wheel. Power for the compressor was drawn from a new type of turbine similar to a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>fan,</b> as opposed to the more typical pinwheel-like design of conventional engines. The turbine drove the compressor using gearing, rather than a shaft. The resulting engine was arranged {{in the form of a}} large disk, which he referred to as a [...] "pancake engine." [...] The jet thrust exited from around the entire rim of the engine, and this presented problems trying to adapt the design to a typical aircraft.|$|E
500|$|First, the {{turbocharger}} {{was split}} and positioned alongside the Motor Generator Unit-Heat (MGU-H)—the generator harvesting heat {{energy from the}} exhaust manifold used to power the turbine—and positioned within the cylinder banks forming the 'V' configuration of the engine. In order to make this fit, Honda eschewed {{the use of a}} <b>centrifugal</b> <b>fan</b> in its single-stage compressor in favour of using several smaller fans positioned at intervals along a shaft. Although this would limit the ability of the turbocharger to build up the maximum amount of boost pressure, the 100kg/h fuel flow limit introduced in 2014 minimised the impact of this. The Motor Generator Unit-Kinetic (MGU-K)—the generator harvesting energy from the engine spinning while under braking—was positioned in front of the engine to deliver energy directly to the crankshaft, following the convention established with the introduction of the kinetic energy recovery system in [...] The batteries housing the energy harvested by the MGU-H and MGU-K were merged with the Electronic Control Unit and positioned in front of the engine. Both the MGU-H and MGU-K were capable of harvesting [...] of energy per lap. However, under the 2015 regulations, both systems could only deploy [...] of energy per lap.|$|E

5000|$|If, for example, a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>fan</b> moves 1,000 CFM at 70°F it {{will also}} move 1,000 CFM at 200°F. The air volume {{delivered}} by the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>fan</b> is not affected by density. However, since the 200°F air weighs {{much less than the}} 70°F air, the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>fan</b> will create less static pressure and will require less brake horsepower. When a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>fan</b> is specified for a given CFM and static pressure at conditions other than standard, an air density correction factor must be applied to select the proper size fan to meet the new condition. Since 200°F air weighs only 80% of 70°F air, the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>fan</b> will create less pressure. To get the actual pressure required at 200°F, the designer would have to multiply the pressure at standard conditions by an air density correction factor of 1.25 (i.e., 1.0 / 0.80) to get the system to operate correctly. To get the actual horsepower at 200°F, the designer would have to divide the brake horsepower at standard conditions by the air density correction factor.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In a {{conventional}} one-dimensional scheme design of <b>centrifugal</b> <b>fans</b> and compres-sors, {{it is assumed}} that there is no flow prewhirl at the impeller inlet when the inlet guide vane is absent. However, many experiments have proved that the flow prewhirl does exist at the inlet of centrifugal impellers. This results in an error in the design of <b>centrifugal</b> <b>fans</b> and compressors. In this study a new method is presented to calculate the Euler work of centrifugal impellers con-sidering the presence of an inlet flow prewhirl in the case without the inlet guide vane. Stodola’s approachdealingwith the slip velocity at the impeller outlet is applied to the impeller inlet. A new formula for Euler work calculation is deduced to evaluate the effect of the inlet prewhirl. The new formula has been applied to 33 industrial <b>centrifugal</b> <b>fans</b> and the calculated results have been compared with the experimental data of these fans. The comparison shows that the new formula is more accurate in most cases than the original formula without consideration of the inlet flow prewhirl, and the accuracy has been improved by more than 10 per cent on average. The aim {{of this study is to}} improve the accuracy of the one-dimensional scheme design of <b>centrifugal</b> <b>fans</b> and to provide a reference for a similar research...|$|R
40|$|The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) {{performed}} a feasibility {{analysis for the}} purpose of either modifying, supplementing, or replacing its two main mine fans.

Since the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>fans</b> were installed in 1988, multiple operational and performance concerns have been identified. A comprehensive engineering study was conducted in 1995 to: (1) qualify and quantify operational concerns; (2) evaluate possible alternatives; and (3) recommend an optimum solution. Multiple system modification and/or replacement scenarios were evaluated with associated cost estimates developed. The study considered replacement with either <b>centrifugal</b> or axial <b>fans.</b> Multiple fan duties are required at the WIPP. Therefore, Variable Frequency Drives and Inlet Vane Controls (IVC) were investigated for <b>centrifugal</b> <b>fans.</b> In-flight adjustable blades were investigated for axial fans.

40|$|<b>Centrifugal</b> <b>fans</b> usually {{operate at}} high {{rotating}} speeds and hence generate {{high levels of}} noise whose reduction over {{a broad range of}} operating conditions is a key concern for the designer. An important first step in this direction is identification of noise sources and its quantification.
