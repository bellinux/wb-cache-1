30|$|The {{objective}} of this research study is to investigate the early-age cracking and its mitigation. In this study, a tool was developed to facilitate predicting the early-age <b>cracking</b> <b>in</b> bridge decks. It helps <b>in</b> predicting <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> both under-construction and future bridge decks. Two case studies were investigated to examine the issue of cracking and to compare {{the outcome of the}} developed tool to that of an available software program “HIPERPAV”. After verification, the tool was used to check the <b>cracking</b> tendency <b>in</b> newer bridges with different material properties. Also, field investigation was conducted to observe deck <b>cracking</b> <b>in</b> existing bridge decks and monitor the development of transverse <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> new bridge under construction. In general, the ultimate goal of this research study is to provide a comprehensive insight of the issue of early-age <b>cracking</b> <b>in</b> bridge deck and to provide recommendations to limit the problem.|$|R

5|$|Blacklock, still unnamed, had {{his first}} race as a three-year-old in the St. Leger Stakes at Doncaster on Monday 22 September. He did not arrive at Doncaster until the Saturday before, and after reports that he was amiss his odds had {{lengthened}} {{to as much as}} 10/1 in the betting. After arriving, he had a gallop in the afternoon and soon shortened in the betting. After another of the pre-race favourites, Stainborough, was withdrawn due to illness Blacklock was sent off as the short-priced favourite at about evens. Blacklock appeared {{like he was going to}} win easily and Jackson eased him up in the final furlong (200 metres) of the race. However, Ebor and Restless began to quickly close down his lead. By the time Jackson realised, Blacklock could not accelerate quick enough and Ebor came out on top, beating Blacklock by a neck. Restless finished in third place and was the only other runner that could be placed by the judge. Blacklock had a <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> one of his hind heels, which was thought to have affected him in the race.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} {{story about the}} {{cracking}} of the bell is that it happened when the bell was rung upon the 1835 death of the Chief Justice of the United States, John Marshall. This story originated in 1876, when the volunteer curator of Independence Hall, Colonel Frank Etting, {{announced that he had}} ascertained the truth of the story. While there is little evidence to support this view, it has been widely accepted and taught. Other claims regarding the <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> the bell include stories that it was damaged while welcoming Lafayette on his return to the United States in 1824, that it cracked announcing the passing of the British Catholic Relief Act 1829, and that some boys had been invited to ring the bell, and inadvertently damaged it. David Kimball, in his book compiled for the National Park Service, suggests that it most likely cracked sometime between 1841 and 1845, either on the Fourth of July or on Washington's Birthday.|$|E
5|$|With America's {{entry into}} World War II, many {{professional}} players {{had left to}} serve in the armed forces. A large number of minor league teams disbanded as a result and the major league game seemed under threat as well. Chicago Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley led the formation of a new professional league with women players to help keep the game in the public eye – the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League existed from 1943 to 1954. The inaugural College World Series was held in 1947, and the Babe Ruth League youth program was founded. This program soon became another important organizing body for children's baseball. The first <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> the unwritten agreement barring blacks from white-controlled professional ball occurred the previous year: Jackie Robinson was signed by the National League's Brooklyn Dodgers—where Branch Rickey had become general manager—and began playing for their minor league team in Montreal. In 1947, Robinson broke the major leagues' color barrier when he debuted with the Dodgers; Larry Doby debuted with the American League's Cleveland Indians later the same year. Latin American players, largely overlooked before, also started entering the majors in greater numbers. In 1951, two Chicago White Sox, Venezuelan-born Chico Carrasquel and black Cuban-born Minnie Miñoso, became the first Hispanic All-Stars.|$|E
5|$|After hatching, the nymphs {{fall from}} the {{branches}} to seek a <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> the soil where they can burrow, often {{to a depth of}} 10–40cm (4–16in), by digging with their large forelegs. Larger species of cicada like A.curvicosta are thought to spend 2–8 years underground, during which time they grow and feed through their rostrum on the sap from tree roots. They moult five times before emerging from the ground to shed their final shell. Although consistently taking place at night, the emergence of the population is diffusely spread over the season in comparison to the more high-density Australian species. The sex ratio is about 1.15males to every female, consistent throughout the emergence. The metabolic rate over a period of about 6.5hours during emergence of A.curvicosta is about 1.8times the resting metabolic rate of the adult. A South East Queensland study reported nymphs would emerge on most tree species but avoid Norfolk pine (Araucaria heterophylla) and broad-leaved paperbark (Melaleuca quinquenervia). The adults are usually found between November and May but are sometimes observed as early as September and until as late as June. They were recorded as appearing every year, mainly in December and January in western Sydney, with a similar 92-day emergence period from late November until late February recorded in South East Queensland. This makes it one of the last Australian cicadas to emerge each season. The nymph grips onto the tree bark with all of its legs, swallows air and redistributes haemolymph to split the cast down the center of its back. It then extracts its head and clypeus by hunching its body, and when these have emerged, arches back to draw the legs out of their casing. It then slowly unfolds its wings, finally bending forward and gripping onto the front of the shell to free its abdomen. Once free it hangs for hours more as the wings harden.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} the mechanism of horizontal <b>cracking</b> <b>in</b> continuously reinforced concrete pavement (CRCP). To this end, a numerical model to predict the risk of horizontal <b>cracking</b> <b>in</b> CRCP was developed. Material properties and steel design were considered in the numerical analysis and their effects on the risk of horizontal cracking were investigated. Based on numerical analysis results, laboratory testing was also conducted in order to simulate the horizontal <b>cracking</b> <b>in</b> transverse <b>crack</b> interface <b>in</b> CRCP. A horizontal cracking frame was developed and the mechanism of horizontal cracking was experimentally investigated. Longitudinal steel plays a significant role <b>in</b> developing horizontal <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> CRCP. Significant stress of concrete develops near longitudinal steel because of steel restraint. It indicates that the horizontal crack perpendicular to maximum stress of concrete can occur near the steel. The horizontal cracks initiate from the transverse crack interface and propagate along the longitudinal steel. The effects of rebar temperature at the concrete placemen...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Shrinkage <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> {{swelling}} soils {{determine their}} transport properties. An available model of shrinkage <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> a brittle medium, having constant relevant properties and desiccating in conditions of shock drying, {{is used as}} a basis for the description of <b>crack</b> growth <b>in</b> water saturated soils undergoing desiccation and shrinkage. A key point is the existence of a minimum crack capable of developing at shrinkage. The concept of the minimum quasi-brittle crack capable of developing at shrinkage leads to two possible types of shrinkage <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> clay soils. The major objective of this work is a synthesis of existing information relating to interconnections between crack networks, aggregates, and physical properties of drying and shrinking, but staying saturated clay soils...|$|R
