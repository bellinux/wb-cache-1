25|$|Hydrological {{resources}} (see Geography above) {{are also}} lacking: {{the demand for}} water exceeds the supply, with this imbalance especially serious in Alicante province. In particularly severe drought years, the problem is managed through occasional nocturnal restrictions during summer and exploitation of aquifers. Valencia's water needs result in harsh contention with neighbouring regions such as <b>Castilla–La</b> <b>Mancha</b> and Catalonia.|$|E
25|$|The most emblematic {{mountain}} of the Valencian Community is the Penyagolosa, in the Alcalatén area. It is widely {{thought to be}} the highest peak with 1,813 m, but actually the highest peak is the Calderón (1,839 m) located in the Rincón de Ademuz, a Valencian exclave between Aragon and <b>Castilla–La</b> <b>Mancha.</b> The most emblematic mountain {{in the southern part of}} the territory is the Aitana (1,558 m).|$|E
25|$|The Csb zone has warm {{rather than}} hot summers, and extends to {{additional}} cool-winter areas not {{typically associated with}} a Mediterranean climate, such as much of central and northern-central of Spain (e.g. western Castile–León, northeastern <b>Castilla-La</b> <b>Mancha</b> and northern Madrid) and into much rainier areas (notably Galicia). Note areas with relatively high rainfall such as Galicia are not considered Mediterranean under local classifications, but classed as oceanic.|$|E
25|$|The Valencian Community, or the Valencian Country, is an {{autonomous}} community of Spain. It {{is the fourth}} most populous autonomous community after Andalusia, Catalonia and Madrid with more than 4.9 million inhabitants. Its homonymous capital Valencia is the third largest city and metropolitan area in Spain. It is located along the Mediterranean coast {{on the east side}} of the Iberian peninsula. It borders with Catalonia to the north, Aragon and <b>Castilla–La</b> <b>Mancha</b> to the west, and Murcia to the south. The Valencian Community consists of three provinces which are Castellón, Valencia and Alicante.|$|E
25|$|His final {{international}} outing at the 1968 International Cross Country Championships saw him {{fall outside}} the top fifty runners in 52nd place. Having been an amateur, he ended {{his career in}} poverty and settled in Lasarte-Oria, the hometown of his wife, Conchita. The couple had four children, two girls and two boys, and later moved to Guadalajara, <b>Castilla-La</b> <b>Mancha.</b> Still of humble means, Aritmendi suffered an injury and his family struggled. As a result he sold his International Cross Country gold medal in order to buy food for his family.|$|E

In 2004, López was inducted as an honorary member of the Academy of Arts and Letters in New York, and in 2006 {{he was awarded the}} Velázquez Prize for Fine Arts.|$|E
25|$|The {{semi-arid}} climate (BSk, BSh), is predominant in {{the southeastern}} quarter of the country, but is also widespread {{in other areas of}} Spain. It covers most of the Region of Murcia, southern Valencia and eastern Andalusia, where true hot desert climates also exist. Further to the north, it is predominant in the upper and mid reaches of the Ebro valley, which crosses southern Navarre, central Aragon and western Catalonia. It also is found in Madrid, Extremadura, <b>Castilla-La</b> <b>Mancha,</b> and some locations of western Andalusia. The dry season extends beyond the summer and average temperature depends on altitude and latitude.|$|E
25|$|There {{are only}} two major rivers: the Segura in the Province of Alicante, whose source is in Andalusia, and the Júcar (Xúquer) in Province of Valencia, whose source is in <b>Castilla–La</b> <b>Mancha.</b> Both are {{subjected}} to very intense human regulation for cities, industries and, especially, agricultural consumption. The river Turia (Túria) is the third largest and has its source in Aragon. Most rivers in the area, such as the Vinalopó, are usually short, have little current (due to agricultural usage, climatic reasons or both) and are often completely dry during the summer. Other Valencian rivers are the Serpis and Sénia.|$|E
25|$|Gourmets {{generally}} prefer {{white wine}} to red to accompany cheese as its acidity agrees {{well with the}} fat in dairy products. Dry wines with mineral aromas such as chardonnay or sauvignon blanc bring out the milky taste of goat cheese. Aromatic wines, such as Gewurztraminer and some sparkling wines support the strong taste of Washed-rind cheeses (Maroilles, Epoisses, Munster, etc.). Neutral white wines (<b>Castilla-La</b> <b>Mancha,</b> Italian Trebbiano) are well suited to sheep cheese {{and there are also}} Manchego and pecorino romano for a little spicy. The cooked pressed cheeses require a bold wine, woodland. There is perfect agreement between the Comté cheese and the yellow wine of the Jura. Fortified wines are recommended with veined cheeses (Blue or Roquefort). In this case, the cheese mould (Penicillium roqueforti) and the wine (noble rot) form a harmonious whole.|$|E
