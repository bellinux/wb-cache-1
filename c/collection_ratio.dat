A pick-up strategy is in place according to which vehicles are dispatched from collection centers to the locations of product holders to transport their returns. Each product holder has an inherent willingness to return a core, and decides {{on the basis of the}} quality-dependent financial incentive offered by the company. Since the company seeks only economic profitability, the collected amounts may not be aligned with the target <b>collection</b> <b>ratio</b> imposed by the government. In this case, the government may alleviate the under-collection issue through a subsidy paid to the company for each core collected. From the government’s perspective the problem is to find the minimum subsidy level while meeting the target <b>collection</b> <b>ratio.</b> We propose a bilevel programming formulation for this collection system design problem.

In the intermittent receiver-driven data transmission (IRDT) protocol, which aims at saving energy, communication between two nodes commences when multiple receiver nodes transmit their own IDs and the sender nodes receive them.

We then introduce procedures to determine the interval which decreases or minimizes this probability. Afterwards, we include a data aggregation mechanism into IRDT to reduce data transmission frequency and the occurrence of control packet collisions. Through computer simulation, we show that IRDT can offer greater reduction of the average energy consumption compared with RI-MAC and X-MAC, especially at small loads, and we also demonstrate that IRDT with collision avoidance for control packets can attain higher performance than the original IRDT.

40|$|Abstract — In a {{large-scale}} wireless sensor network, thousands of sensor nodes periodically generate and forward data {{back to the}} sink. In our recent outdoor deployment, we observe that some bottleneck nodes can greatly determine other nodes ’ data <b>collection</b> <b>ratio,</b> and thus affect the whole network performance. To figure out {{the importance of a}} node in data collection, the manager needs to understand the interactive behaviors among the parent and child nodes. To address this issue, we present a management tool BOND (BOttleneck Node Detector). We introduce the concept of Node Dependence to characterize how much a node relies on each of its parent nodes. BOND models the routing process as a Hidden Markov Model, and uses a machine learning approach to learn the state transition probabilities in this model based on the observed traces. BOND utilizes Node Dependence to explore the hidden bottleneck nodes in the network. Moreover, we can predict how adding or removing the sensor nodes would impact the data flow, thus avoid data loss and flow congestion in redeployment. We implement our tool on real hardware and deploy it in an outdoor system. Our extensive experiments show that BOND infers the Node Dependence with an average accuracy of more than 85 %. I...|$|E

The duration of the emergence season varied between sites and years, from at least 45 to at least 70 days, potentially commencing by late October and extending into early January and possibly beyond. Although some evidence suggested cohort splitting, it was not confirmed. Observations of spatially and temporally aggregated emergence clusters are consistent with observed oviposition patterns of individual females, suggesting cohort emergence. Observations of mortalities at emergence and of emergence location are provided; the latter should assist researchers and resource managers in identifying breeding sites in heterogeneous swamp vegetation...|$|R
40|$|Terrestrial {{remote sensing}} imagery {{involves}} {{the acquisition of}} information from the Earth's surface without physical contact with the area under study. Among the remote sensing modalities, hyperspectral imaging has recently emerged as a powerful passive technology. This technology has been widely used {{in the fields of}} urban and regional planning, water resource management, environmental monitoring, food safety, counterfeit drugs detection, oil spill and other types of chemical contamination detection, biological hazards prevention, and target detection for military and security purposes [2 - 9]. Hyperspectral sensors sample the reflected solar radiation from the Earth surface in the portion of the spectrum extending from the visible region through the near-infrared and mid-infrared (wavelengths between 0. 3 and 2. 5 µm) in hundreds of narrow (of the order of 10 nm) contiguous bands [10]. This high spectral resolution can be used for object detection and for discriminating between different objects based on their spectral xharacteristics [6]. However, this huge spectral resolution yields large amounts of data to be processed. For example, the Airbone Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) [11] collects a 512 (along track) X 614 (across track) X 224 (bands) X 12 (bits) data cube in 5 s, corresponding to about 140 MBs. Similar data <b>collection</b> <b>ratios</b> are achieved by other spectrometers [12]. Such huge data volumes put stringent requirements on communications, storage, and processing. The problem of signal sbspace identification of hyperspectral data represents a crucial first step in many hypersctral processing algorithms such as target detection, change detection, classification, and unmixing. The identification of this subspace enables a correct dimensionality reduction (DR) yelding gains in data storage and retrieval and in computational time and complexity. Additionally, DR may also improve algorithms performance since it reduce data dimensionality without losses in the useful signal components. The computation of statistical estimates is a relevant example of the advantages of DR, since the number of samples required to obtain accurate estimates increases drastically with the dimmensionality of the data (Hughes phnomenon) [13]...|$|R
