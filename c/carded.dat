5|$|The match itself {{swirled around}} {{controversy}} between Abiodun Okulaja's (the center referee) calls and officiating. The most questionable calls were associated {{the severity of}} cards distributed to players and a late-match decision to award a penalty kick to the United, in which many claimed was a fake trip in the box. One controversial call came from a reckless challenge by Galaxy midfielder, Beckham, to United forward, Josh Wolff in the 40th minute. Following the referee stopping play to call the foul, a verbal exchange between Beckham and United's Santino Quaranta resulted in a swarm of United and Galaxy players coming in to push the two apart. While Quaranta was not <b>carded</b> for his exchange with Beckham, Beckham was <b>carded</b> for his foul against Wolff in the 37th minute and Davies' penalty kick in the 91st. The goal received much national attention from the controversy surrounding the decision to award a penalty, and Davies' celebration for successfully converting the kick. Subsequent to the match, center referee Abiodun Okulaja ejected Galaxy midfielder Jovan Kirovski for cursing at him while sniping his decision.|$|E

York's Conference Premier rivals Fleetwood Town made an offer for Boucaud during January 2012, which was rejected by manager Gary Mills.|$|E

5|$|The 2002 FIFA World Cup {{featured}} a stunning early exit for both Henry and France as the defending champions were eliminated {{in the group}} stage after failing to score a goal in all three games. France lost against Senegal in their first group match and Henry was red <b>carded</b> for a dangerous sliding challenge in their next match against Uruguay. In that game, France played to a 0–0 draw, but Henry was forced to miss the final group match due to suspension; France lost 2–0 to Denmark.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the first}} half, nearing the halftime break, came an unusual string of {{reckless}} challenges from Toronto right back, Mikael Yourassowsky, on loan from Croatian side Rijeka. In the 36th minute of play, Yourassowsky was <b>carded</b> for a reckless challenge on Andy Najar, and a minute later was given a second yellow and subsequently ejected for doing a similarly mistimed tackle on Chris Pontius. It would not be until the 62nd minute that United were able to capitalize on the shorthanded Toronto, restoring parity at 2–2 thanks a goal from Ngwenya. The draw gave D.C. United the cup title.|$|E
5|$|On 12 March 2016, Costa {{received}} his first red card in a Chelsea shirt {{near the end}} their 2–0 FA Cup quarter-final defeat to Everton for confronting opponent Gareth Barry. Footage appeared to show Costa biting Barry during that confrontation after clashing heads. Earlier in the match, Costa appeared to spit {{in the direction of}} the referee after he was yellow <b>carded</b> for a clash with Barry. Later, both Costa and Barry denied that the bite occurred. Costa's two-match ban was extended to three, and he was fined £20,000. On 2 May, as Chelsea drew 2–2 against Tottenham to deny them the title, Costa was gouged in the eyes by Mousa Dembélé during a mass brawl; the Belgian received a retrospective six-match ban.|$|E

Two weeks later, Boyd was sent-off for violent conduct in a 3–0 home loss to league leaders Brighton & Hove Albion, {{only the second time}} he had been red <b>carded</b> in his career. He returned to first-team action on 16 November 2010, playing in the club's 4–1 FA Cup win over Stockport County.

He went on to score five goals in five matches throughout February and March, scoring once against Colchester United. This goal was followed by braces against Exeter City and Carlisle United respectively, although Boyd missed the chance to complete his hat-trick in the latter match when he missed a 90th-minute penalty.

He made it eight goals in eight matches when he scored in Peterborough's 2–2 away draw at Bristol Rovers.

25|$|Long draw is spun from a <b>carded</b> rolag. The rolag is spun {{without much}} {{stretching}} of the fibres from the cylindrical configuration. This {{is done by}} allowing twist into a short section of the rolag, and then pulling back, without letting the rolag change position in one's hands, until the yarn is the desired thickness. The twist will concentrate in the thinnest part of the roving; thus, when the yarn is pulled, the thicker sections with less twist will tend to thin out. Once the yarn is the desired thickness, enough twist is added to make the yarn strong. Then the yarn is wound onto the bobbin, and the process starts again.|$|E
