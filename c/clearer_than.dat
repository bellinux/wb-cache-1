5|$|There are two {{possible}} ways the poem was composed. The first, Mason's concept, {{argues that the}} Eton copy was the original for the Elegy poem and was complete in itself. Later critics claimed that the original was more complete than the later version; Roger Lonsdale argued that the early version had a balance that set up the debate, and was <b>clearer</b> <b>than</b> the later version. Lonsdale also argued that the early poem fits classical models, including Virgil's Georgics and Horace's Epodes. The early version of the poem was finished, according to Mason, in August 1742, {{but there is little}} evidence to give such a definite date. Mason argued that the poem was in response to West's death, but there is little to indicate that Mason would have such information.|$|E
5|$|Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) is an {{archaeologist}} who discovers star charts in caves {{around the world}} with his lover, Elizabeth Shaw. After awakening from cryosleep near LV-223, he introduces the purpose of the mission with Shaw. While the Prometheus flies over the moon, Holloway spots an artificial arrangement of structures and directs the ship to land near one. He goes with the first expedition crew to the concealed Juggernaut, discovers that the air is <b>clearer</b> <b>than</b> anywhere on Earth and removes his helmet. After Shaw retrieves a preserved Engineer head, the expedition is informed of an incoming storm and Holloway {{and the rest of the}} crew return to the Prometheus. Disappointed by the Engineers' apparent extinction, he sulks and berates Shaw for still being a Christian. David brings Holloway a drink, and they discuss the merits of creating beings; he tainted the drink with a minute organism from a cylinder he brought from he structure, infecting Holloway. Holloway has sex with Shaw shortly afterwards, impregnating her with an alien embryo. After seeing a small, extraterrestrial parasite in his eye, Holloway returns to the Engineer ship and becomes ill. As the expedition returns, Holloway worsens; the infection becomes obvious, and Vickers obeys his request to kill him with a flamethrower outside the ship.|$|E
5|$|The PlayStation 3 version {{supports}} display {{resolutions of}} 720p and 1080p – the former with {{and the latter}} without anti-aliasing – while the Vita version runs at 720x408 pixels. Graphical features such as the water effects and lighting were improved. Other changes include the addition of bloom, the move from circular to dynamic shadows and tweaks to environmental geometry and texturing. The developers revised the 3D models for both games: most models merely received new textures but those of the playable characters were rebuilt completely with noticeable changes to their faces. The cutscenes and prerendered environments needed to be adjusted from a 4:3 to a 16:9 screen ratio, the process of which required lots of art and programming readjustments. For example, the widescreen display led to character models being visible in a cutscene although they were to appear only in a later shot; these instances had to be corrected. Both the prerendered background images and cutscenes were cropped {{at the top and}} bottom to fit the new screen ratio. However, they received a bump in resolution to appear much <b>clearer</b> <b>than</b> in the PlayStation 2 version. The gameplay also needed to be duplicated while bringing it up to the standard of a high definition game, which was harder than the team thought.|$|E

5|$|The {{motives of}} the nobility are {{somewhat}} <b>clearer</b> <b>than</b> {{those of the}} peasants; greed was apparently not a major factor. It is commonly assumed, for example by Runciman as mentioned above, that only younger members of a family went on crusade, looking for wealth and adventure elsewhere, as they had no prospects for advancement at home. Riley-Smith has shown {{that this was not}} always the case. The crusade was led by some of the most powerful nobles of France, who left everything behind, and it was often the case that entire families went on crusade at their own great expense. For example, Robert of Normandy loaned the Duchy of Normandy to his brother William II of England, and Godfrey sold or mortgaged his property to the church. According to Tancred's biographer, he was worried about the sinful nature of knightly warfare, and was excited to find a holy outlet for violence. Tancred and Bohemond, as well as Godfrey, Baldwin, and their older brother Eustace III, Count of Boulogne, are examples of families who crusaded together. Riley-Smith argues that the enthusiasm for the crusade was perhaps based on family relations, as most of the French crusaders were distant relatives. Nevertheless, in at least some cases, personal advancement played a role in Crusaders' motives. For instance, Bohemond was motivated by the desire to carve himself out a territory in the east, and had previously campaigned against the Byzantines to try to achieve this. The Crusade gave him a further opportunity, which he took after the Siege of Antioch, taking possession of the city and establishing the Principality of Antioch.|$|E
25|$|The {{abolition}} of the classification by years and days made it <b>clearer</b> <b>than</b> before that repentance and faith are required not only for remission of eternal punishment for mortal sin but also for remission of temporal punishment for sin.

25|$|The use of op-amps as circuit blocks is {{much easier}} and <b>clearer</b> <b>than</b> specifying all their {{individual}} circuit elements (transistors, resistors, etc.), whether the amplifiers used are integrated or discrete circuits.

25|$|This {{is not to}} {{say that}} common law is better in every situation. For example, civil law can be <b>clearer</b> <b>than</b> case law when the {{legislature}} has had the foresight and diligence to address the precise set of facts applicable to a particular situation. For that reason, civil law statutes tend to be somewhat more detailed than statutes written by common law legislatures—but, conversely, that tends to make the statute more difficult to read (the United States tax code is an example). Nonetheless, as a practical matter, no civil law legislature can ever address the full spectrum of factual possibilities in the breadth, depth and detail of the case law of the common law courts of even a smaller jurisdiction, and that deeper, more complete body of law provides additional predictability that promotes commerce.|$|E
25|$|The {{handsome}} scribe Kameni {{has fallen}} in love with Renisenb, and eventually asks her to marry him. Unsure whether she loves him or her father's advisor Hori, whom she has known since she was a child, she leaves the choice effectively in her father's hands and becomes engaged to Kameni. She realises, however, that his relationship with Nofret was closer than she had supposed, and that jealousy may have influenced Nofret's bitter hatred towards the family. Hori and Esa, the elderly mother of Imhotep (a clever woman who although almost completely blind sees things <b>clearer</b> <b>than</b> most others - especially her son) begin to investigate the possibility of a human murderer. Ipy, himself a likely suspect, starts to boast about his new, better position with his father; he plots to get rid of housekeeper Henet and tells her so.

25|$|In 2005, {{upon the}} opening of the South Eastern Motorway section of the M50, the National Roads Authority erected new style gantry signage. The new signage {{retained}} typical colours and fonts but differed from older side of road signage in that it used separate overhead panels for each lane, headed with the route number in each case as well as new half-gantry signs closer to the exit. The new signage was also erected on the N2 Finglas – Ashbourne scheme and N7 Clondalkin – Naas scheme. These were the first roads in Ireland where overhead gantry signage {{has been used as a}} matter of course, instead of just very major junctions. Drivers are given clear advanced warning 1km ahead of an upcoming junction. A half gantry at the junction then directed them to their destination. The new style signage is visually <b>clearer</b> <b>than</b> older type signage with drivers able to read the gantry signage from a distance of approximately 300m on a straight stretch of road. Despite its significant advantages, the new gantry signage caused confusion because the downward arrows over the left traffic lanes seemed to indicate to drivers that they should pull out into the right lane if they wish to continue on the motorway or dual carriageway, breaking the keep left rule.|$|E

500|$|The pied butcherbird {{has been}} {{considered}} the most accomplished songbird in Australia, its song described as a [...] "magic flute" [...] by one writer, richer and <b>clearer</b> <b>than</b> the Australian magpie. Song melodies vary across the continent and no single song is sung by the whole population. There is no clear demarcation between simple calls and elaborate songs: duets, and even larger choirs, are common. The species improvises extensively in creating new and complex melodies. One of its calls has been likened to the opening bars of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. Singing often takes place at dawn, and rarely late in the day. Pied butcherbirds sometimes sing on moonlit nights.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{music has}} been {{particularly}} well received.

The more reserved Polson claimed that the music [...] "definitely rocks" [...] and is <b>clearer</b> <b>than</b> that of Genesis games. Similarly, the Red Bull staff called the music [...] "absolutely stunning", likening it to gaming soundtracks of the early 1990s.

500|$|Kelefa Sanneh wrote a lukewarm {{review of}} the album in The New York Times, believing that Jay-Z's {{reluctance}} to indulge in the gangsta rap lyricism of his past resulted in wavering, equivocal songs such as [...] "No Hook" [...] and [...] "Say Hello".

500|$|Researchers include biologists, geologists, oceanographers, physicists, astronomers, glaciologists, and meteorologists. Geologists tend {{to study}} plate tectonics, meteorites from outer space, and {{resources}} from {{the breakup of the}} supercontinent Gondwana. Glaciologists in Antarctica are concerned with the study of the history and dynamics of floating ice, seasonal snow, glaciers, and ice sheets. Biologists, in addition to examining the wildlife, are interested in how harsh temperatures and the presence of people affect adaptation and survival strategies {{in a wide variety of}} organisms. Medical physicians have made discoveries concerning the spreading of viruses and the body's response to extreme seasonal temperatures. Astrophysicists at Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station study the celestial dome and cosmic microwave background radiation. Many astronomical observations are better made from the interior of Antarctica than from most surface locations because of the high elevation, which results in a thin atmosphere; low temperature, which minimises the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere; and absence of light pollution, thus allowing for a view of space <b>clearer</b> <b>than</b> anywhere else on Earth. Antarctic ice serves as both the shield and the detection medium for the largest neutrino telescope in the world, built [...] below Amundsen–Scott station.|$|E
500|$|In 1997, Klepacki {{scored a}} Blade Runner adaptation. Though Westwood {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} use the original film score by Vangelis, the company was not allowed access to the original master recordings, and Klepacki had to recreate the themes by ear. Developers were satisfied by his attention to detail, feeling that his digital recreations sounded <b>clearer</b> <b>than</b> the originals. In 1998, Klepacki composed for Dune 2000. He attempted to update the music from Dune II into [...] "this non-blip stuff," [...] and worked in homages to the original style of the films as composed by Toto. Dune 2000 was panned by critics, though Klepacki's score was praised for adhering to the traditional Dune style. Klepacki considered 2000 {{to be a more}} definitive work than Dune 2, which was constrained by software and hardware limitations. He composed for [...] with Jarrid Mendelson—with whom he would later collaborate on [...] He began by writing Stomp, an energetic rock piece intended to recreate the effect of Hell March for the new game. Coincidentally, one of the trailers for Command and Conquer 3 featured 'Stomp' as the soundtrack. Westwood instead wanted Tiberian Sun to feature darker, more moody music, and Stomp was shelved in favor of the current sound. Bereft of ideas due to the stark change in direction, Klepacki asked Mendelson to collaborate; he regards tracks they both worked on as the best. Tiberian Sun ultimately featured dark, ambient techno music and ambient space music suited to the game's post-apocalyptic and futuristic setting. Klepacki cited the piece [...] "Mad Rap" [...] as his favorite. An avid Star Wars fan, he enjoyed scoring cut scenes featuring James Earl Jones, the voice of Darth Vader. The scenes also allowed him to integrate the Airstrike and No Mercy themes into the game's score despite the aforementioned shift. With the expansion pack Firestorm, he attempted to [...] "set things right" [...] by writing more upbeat songs and including Stomp, which would also appear in Command & Conquer: Renegade.|$|E
