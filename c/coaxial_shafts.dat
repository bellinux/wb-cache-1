50|$|The {{original}} XR-7755-1 design drove {{a single}} propeller, but {{even on the}} largest aircraft the propeller needed to absorb the power would have been ridiculously large. This led to a minor redesign that produced the XR-7755-3, using a new propeller gearing system driving a set of <b>coaxial</b> <b>shafts</b> to power a set of contra-rotating propellers. The propeller reduction gearing also had two speed settings {{to allow for a}} greater range of operating power than adjustable props alone could deliver. Another minor modification resulted in the XR-7755-5, the only change being the replacement of carburetors with a new fuel injection system.|$|E

The gear mechanism achieves high gear ratios. Its limiting structural node is the output stage, to which the gears belong. The problem is addressed through the analysis of the stress resistance of tooth flanks in contact and bending. The content of the paper is a comparison of analytical computations with the modal analysis on the model. We expect that new findings will be beneficial for further optimization of the gear mechanism...|$|E

The transformer is of the rotary type and includes a ferrite core and two primary windings which are stationary with respect to a seconary winding which rotates within an annular cavity adjacent an axial bore in the core. The core is comprised of two cup type core halves. Electrical connection to the secondary winding is made through a split bobbin assembly which couples to a <b>coaxial</b> <b>shaft</b> assembly located in the axial bore.

40|$|The {{design of}} a novel {{transmission}} for speed reduction is re-ported in this paper. The transmission {{is based on the}} layout of pure-rolling indexing cam mechanisms, for it is intended to elim-inate backlash and friction, which are the main drawbacks of gear transmissions. The design relies on a unified methodology for in-dexing cam mechanisms, whereby the same procedure is used to design planar, spherical, and spatial mechanisms. Two versions of the speed reducer, that we term Speed-o-Cam, are described here, namely, planar, to couple shafts of parallel axes, and spher-ical, to couple shafts of intersecting axes. By means of a cas-cade of two planar versions of Speed-o-Cam, moreover, <b>coaxial</b> <b>shafts</b> can be coupled. Moreover, contrary to other alternatives to gear transmissions, such as harmonic drives or epicyclic trans-missions, Speed-o-Cam caters to shafts with either parallel or in-tersecting axes; in the latter case, moreover, the angle at which the axes intersect can vary from 0 to 180 continuously. The de-sign with shaft axes at 0 leads to an internal cam, i. e., one with its axis external to the axes of the follower and the roller in con-tact; for shaft axes at 180, the design leads to an external cam, i. e., one with its axis lying between those of the follower and the roller in contact...|$|E
50|$|While {{the power}} turbine may be {{integral}} with {{the gas generator}} section, many turboprops today feature a free power turbine on a separate <b>coaxial</b> <b>shaft.</b> This enables the propeller to rotate freely, independent of compressor speed. Residual thrust on a turboshaft is avoided by further expansion in the turbine system and/or truncating and turning the exhaust 180 degrees, to produce two opposing jets. Apart from the above, {{there is very little}} difference between a turboprop and a turboshaft.|$|R

50|$|Most modern American civil turbofans {{employ a}} {{relatively}} high-pressure-ratio high-pressure (HP) compressor, with many rows of variable stators to control surge margin at low rpm. In the three-spool RB211/Trent the core compression system is split into two, with the IP compressor, which supercharges the HP compressor, {{being on a}} different <b>coaxial</b> <b>shaft</b> and driven by a separate (IP) turbine. As the HP compressor has a modest pressure ratio its speed can be reduced surge-free, without employing variable geometry. However, because a shallow IP compressor working line is inevitable, the IPC has one stage of variable geometry on all variants except the -535, which has none.|$|R
50|$|As a result, an {{engineer}} at Bristol Engine Company, Gordon Lewis, began in 1956 to study alternative engine concepts, where possible, existing engine components from the Orpheus and Olympus engine series. The work was {{overseen by the}} Technical Director Stanley Hooker. One concept which looked promising was the BE52, which initially used the Orpheus 3 as the engine core and, on a separate <b>coaxial</b> <b>shaft,</b> the first 2 stages of an Olympus 21 LP compressor, which acted as a fan, delivering compressed air to 2 thrust vectoring nozzles {{at the front of}} engine. At this point in design exercise, the exhaust from the LP turbine discharged through a conventional rear nozzle. There were separate intakes for the fan and core compressor because the fan did not supercharge the core compressor.|$|R

40|$|Spline {{couplings}} are mechanical elements used {{to transmit}} power by joining two <b>coaxial</b> rotating <b>shafts.</b> The main damaging phenomenon on these elements is fretting wear, which can occur on teeth surfaces {{when there is}} a relative movement. Therefore, specific design criteria to evaluate teeth damage of spline couplings subjected to fretting wear are needed. In this work, the criterion proposed by Ruiz is considered and criticalities of the first Ruiz parameter are analysed by performing an uncertainty evaluation. The specific working misaligned conditions of a dedicated test rig were considered in this analysis. An uncertainty table allows the comparison of main geometrical and mechanical factors, evidencing their relevant effects. It shows the need of a deeper analysis on the coefficient of friction between the contact surfaces of spline couplings working in misaligned condition...|$|R
50|$|Allison {{adopted a}} reverse-airflow engine {{configuration}} for the Model 250: although air enters the intake/compression {{system in the}} conventional fashion, the compressed air leaving the centrifugal compressor diffuser is ducted rearwards around the turbine system, before being turned through 180 degrees at entry to the combustor. The combustion products expand through the two-stage (single-stage on early engines) high-pressure turbine section, which {{is connected to the}} compressor via the HP shaft. The combustion products continue to expand through the two-stage power turbine which generates shaft horsepower for the aircraft. A <b>coaxial</b> stub <b>shaft</b> connects the power turbine to a compact reduction gearbox, located inboard, between the centrifugal compressor and the exhaust/power turbine system. The exhaust stream then turn through 90 degrees to exit the engine in a radial direction through twin exhaust ducts, which form a V-shape in elevation. An important design feature of the Model 250 engine is its modular construction which greatly simplifies maintenance and repair activity. Also the unique reverse-flow design provides for ease of hot section maintenance.|$|R

This type of gear train is commonly used in main rotor transmissions for helicopters and in other applications which require high reductions in speed. The reliability model is based on the Weibull distribution of the individual reliabilities of the transmission components.

50|$|Representative are low-torque {{synchronous}} motors with a multi-pole {{hollow cylindrical}} magnet (internal poles) surrounding the stator structure. An aluminum cup supports the magnet.

The poles are rather narrow, and between the poles leading {{from one end of the}} coil are an identical set leading from the other end. In all, this creates a repeating sequence of four poles, unshaded alternating with shaded, that creates a circumferential traveling field to which the rotor's magnetic poles rapidly synchronize. Some stepping motors have a similar structure.|$|R

A helical groove pattern is constructed on {{the rotating shaft}} with the pumping pattern such that it tends to pump seal pressurizing gas toward the gas turbine seal. A second helical groove pattern is provided on the stationary housing or counter rotating member <b>coaxial</b> with the <b>shaft,</b> and this pattern {{is designed to provide}} pumping in the direction opposite from that of the groove pattern on the shaft. Gas with entrained debris entering this grooved area will be subjected to high centrifugal forces due to the swirl motion induced by the groove pattern and the rotation of the shaft. This debris is centrifuged outwardly into the outer groove pattern on the housing or counter rotating member. Because the outer groove pattern has a pumping direction opposite from that of the seal, dirt is pumped away from the seal and can be collected in a suitable debris trap remote from the seal location...|$|R
