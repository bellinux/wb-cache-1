40|$|Length {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} attributes of cotton fibers because it has direct impacts on spinning efficiency, yarn strength, and hairiness, and thus on the properties of fabrics [1 – 6]. Measuring the length and distribution of cot-ton fibers has been a vital component in the current <b>cotton</b> <b>classing</b> system [7]. In principle, the testing methods for fiber length measurement can be grouped as indirect and direct measurements. The indirect measurements include weight-based and photo-based (light-transmission) methods. A commonly used weight-based method is the array method [8], in which fibers are separated manually into different length groups and each group is weighed. From the weight-length data, the upper-quartile length, mean length, and coeffi-cient of length variation are calculated. This method, how...|$|E

40|$|Cotton fiber {{properties}} play {{an important}} role in determining spinning performance but explain only a portion of the variability in final yarn quality parameters. This research investigates relationships between ring-spun yarn quality and fiber properties (measured using the High Volume Instrument (HVI) and Advanced Fiber Information System (AFIS)) given additional information on harvest method and cultivar. Seventy-six samples of commercially grown cotton repre-senting five cultivars from six locations across the Texas High Plains were collected over three years. Carded 14. 5 tex (40 Ne) ring-spun yarns were produced and tested for various yarn quality characteristics. Principal component analysis and partial least squares regression were used to determine relationships between fiber and yarn properties.

As the latter did not immediately come into execution, the Government requested interim assistance, which was provided under project TCP/PAK/ 6652, which was operational from 1 July 1986 to 13 April 1987, and allowed the continuation of the work of PAK/ 80 / 024, through the retention of the services of both the national and international staff involved, and the extension of the training programme without interruptionProject TCP/PAK/ 6652 also supported a workshop on the standardization of Pakistan's raw cotton, which was held in Karachi in January 1987, and practical research on several important aspects of ginning and spinning. The standardization of the classification of seed cotton and lint progressed, and the new pricing system, based on quality was continued in the 44 private ginneries in the scheme, as was the arbitration system introduced under PAK/ 80 / 024 for the resolution of price disputes. Draft legislation for the establishment and activities of the Pakistan Cotton Standards Institute was preparedThe follow-up project, PAK/ 86 / 003, was now fully operational, and would ensure that the process of expanding the standardization system for cotton continued.

The impacts of the interaction of agronomic characteristics of cotton cultivars with those of various harvest aid regimes were studied over three growing seasons, and data were used to narrow possible contributors to the observed increased leaf grade values. Multiple trials were conducted throughout the Coastal Bend and Blackland Prairie of Texas, in addition to Tifton, Georgia. Cotton was harvested, lint samples were ginned in a microgin, and lint quality was quantified with HVI. Harvest aid regimes selected provided {{a broad range of}} defoliation and desiccation, from a multiple herbicidal and hormonal modes-of-action. Defoliation levels ranged from 0 to 96 % and desiccation levels ranged from 0 to 90 %. Harvest aid treatments had no impact (P? 0. 05) on leaf grade values for either of the years of the trials. Multiple trials were conducted in five counties in Texas, including the Lower and Upper Coastal Bend and the Blackland Prairie, and were defoliated with a uniform harvest aid treatment to identify leaf and bract morphological differences, and to determine their role in leaf grade. Multi-acre module trials were conducted with a smooth leaf cultivar and a hairy leaf cultivar to obtain leaf grade values following commercial ginning. Leaf and bract pubescence, and leaf and bract area were collected to analyze the resulting impact on cotton leaf grade values. Visual quantification of leaf and bract trichome density was quantified on 10 youngest fully-expanded leaves and 10 mid-canopy full sized bolls, respectively, when cotton was at physiological cut-out. Trichome density quantification indicated substantial variation in cultivars and discrepancies from company based rating systems. Leaf grades values generally increased with increasing trichomes densities, although not always statistically significant. In the split plot cultivar and harvest aid trial, harvest aid efficacy was similar for each of the cultivars, but cultivar trichome density was positively influence the cotton leaf grade value...|$|R

Although current commercial instruments can measure the overall amount of the foreign matter, no instrument can differentiate various types of foreign matter. The goal {{of this study was}} to develop a hyperspectral imaging system to discriminate major types of foreign matter in cotton lint. A push-broom based hyperspectral imaging system with a custom-built multi-thread software was developed to acquire hyperspectral images of cotton fiber with 15 types of foreign matter commonly found in the U. S. cotton lint. A total of 450 (30 replicates for each foreign matter) foreign matter samples were cut into 1 by 1 cm 2 pieces and imaged on the lint surface using reflectance mode in the spectral range from 400 - 1000 nm. The mean spectra of the foreign matter and lint were extracted from the user-defined region-of-interests in the hyperspectral images. The principal component analysis was performed on the mean spectra to reduce the feature dimension from the original 256 bands to the top 3 principal components. The score plots of the 3 principal components were used to examine clusterization patterns for classifying the foreign matter. These patterns were further validated by statistical tests. The experimental results showed that the mean spectra of all 15 types of cotton foreign matter were different from that of the lint. Nine types of cotton foreign matter formed distinct clusters in the score plots. Additionally, all of them were significantly different from each other at the significance level of 0. 05 except brown leaf and bract. The developed hyperspectral imaging system is effective to detect and classify cotton foreign matter on the lint surface and has the potential to be implemented in commercial <b>cotton</b> <b>classing</b> offices...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{dramatic}} geographical {{expansion of the}} U. S. South after 1800, few historians have included the plantation frontier in narratives of region and nation. Received wisdom about the antebellum South holds that it was 2 ̆ 2 old 2 ̆ 2 in two senses: {{that it was a}} stable society ruled by a confident planter class; and that gentry hegemony stretched unbroken from colonial times into the Civil War. This dissertation examines the plantation frontier at close range by looking at the experience of migration and settlement in two counties of antebellum Florida 2 ̆ 7 s cotton belt. In Jackson and Leon counties, the plantation frontier was the site of conflict, crisis, and change: a Southern society disrupted by migration. Using a wide variety of social, political, and cultural sources, this study follows the removals of planters, non-planter or 2 ̆ 2 common 2 ̆ 2 whites, and enslaved African Americans from long-settled plantation districts of older states to Florida. Migration highlighted incipient conflicts among these three groups. Initially, elite kinship groups fought among themselves to control the frontier 2 ̆ 7 s riches. Later they clashed with common whites over access to economic independence, and divergent ideas about masculinity that structured politics and 2 ̆ 2 frontier violence. 2 ̆ 2 Slaves sought to reconstruct families and communities devastated by master-directed separations, but the chaotic society created by migrant planters hampered African Americans 2 ̆ 7 quest for stability.

Common participation in yeoman-style religion and politics, and the return of strong demand for <b>cotton,</b> brought white <b>classes</b> together. Elite hegemony, destroyed by conflict, was slowly rebuilt. Haunted by their recent crisis, planters developed a new narrative that denied frontier discontinuity and historical change. Yet their stable plantation South was old only in rhetoric. In reality, it was a product of recent changes sparked in the process of migration and settlement. ...|$|R
