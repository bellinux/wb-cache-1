5|$|All this <b>changed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Libyan coup d'état of 1 September 1969 that deposed Idris {{and brought}} Muammar Gaddafi to power. Gaddafi claimed the Aouzou Strip in {{northern}} Chad, referring to an unratified treaty signed in 1935 by Italy and France (then the colonial powers of Libya and Chad, respectively). Such claims {{had been previously}} made when in 1954 Idris had tried to occupy Aouzou, but his troops were repelled by the French Colonial Forces.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of the}} Cold War, the AFL {{saw little}} action, apart from a {{reinforced}} company group which was sent to ONUC in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the 1960s. This <b>changed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> advent of the First Liberian Civil War in 1989. The AFL became entangled in the conflict, which lasted from 1989 to 1996–97, and then the Second Liberian Civil War, which lasted from 1999 to 2003.|$|E

50|$|Newtonian fluids can be {{characterized}} by a single coefficient of viscosity for a specific temperature.

The large class of fluids whose viscosity <b>changes</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> strain rate (the relative flow velocity) are called non-Newtonian fluids.|$|R

5|$|In May 1921 {{the policy}} of the Canadian {{government}} towards Arctic expeditions <b>changed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> advent of a new Prime Minister, Arthur Meighen, who withdrew support from Shackleton's proposal. Shackleton was required to rethink his plans, and decided to sail for the Antarctic instead. A varied programme of exploration, coastal mapping, mineral prospecting and oceanographic research in southern waters would replace the abandond Beaufort Sea venture.|$|E
5|$|Television and {{newspapers}} take {{an important role}} in Japanese mass media, though radio and magazines also take a part. For a long time, newspapers were regarded as the most influential information medium in Japan, although audience attitudes towards television <b>changed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> emergence of commercial news broadcasting in the mid-1980s. Over the last decade, television has clearly come to surpass newspapers as Japan's main information and entertainment medium.|$|E
5|$|All that <b>changed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{assassination}} of Tsar Alexander II. The mourning for the tsar meant {{there would be}} no performances in the capital; in addition the political climate of Russia turned sharply against the Jews. Goldfaden's troupe soldiered on for a time—to Minsk, to Bobruisk where they played mainly to Russian soldiers, and to Vitebsk, where he and Sonya ended up having to sue Goldfaden for their pay, and left to rejoin Rosenberg, who was playing in a tent theater in Nezhin. However, matters there proved even worse: Nezhin soon fell prey to a pogrom. The troupe managed to avoid bodily harm, partly by convincing the rioters that they were a French theater troupe and partly by making judicious use of the money the Adlers had won in court from Goldfaden.|$|E

The expanded Second Chance takes place on a Saturday night, adding an extra week to the event's timetable. The format of voting also <b>changed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> introduction of a knock-out system.

5|$|In Nier and Drakengard 3, {{the player}} {{controls}} the main protagonist {{with two other}} characters acting as AI-controlled supports. Drakengard 3 {{was designed to be}} a faster experience than the previous games, with the protagonist being given a special hyper-mode and the ability to freely switch between weapons without pausing the action. Aerial gameplay was also <b>changed,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> dragon now capable of ground combat. Nier, while featuring similar hack-and-slash combat, also includes other gameplay types such as a top-down view for puzzle areas, 2D style areas for buildings or similar structures. Side-quests were also added, which often involved fetch quests, fishing and farming.|$|E
5|$|On 25 October at 10:30, the ROK 1st Infantry Division {{attacked}} north {{with its}} 12th Regiment {{on the western}} bank of Samtan River while the 15th Regiment was {{trying to reach the}} eastern bank. But when the 15th Regiment was about to cross the river, the PVA 120th Division intercepted the South Koreans with heavy artillery fire. The South Koreans first believed the resistance to be the last remnants of the KPA, but the perception soon <b>changed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> capture of the first Chinese prisoner in the Korean War. The prisoner revealed that there were 10,000 Chinese soldiers waiting to join the fight north of Unsan.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, the Persians adopted war engines from the Romans. The Romans had {{achieved}} and maintained {{a high degree}} of sophistication in siege warfare and had developed a range of siege machines. On the other hand, the Parthians were inept at besieging; their cavalry armies were more suited to the hit-and-run tactics that destroyed Antony's siege train in 36BC. The situation <b>changed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rise of the Sasanians, when Rome encountered an enemy equally skilled in siegecraft, who made use of artillery, machines captured from the Romans, embankments, siege towers, and in one instance, even an early form of gas warfare inside tunnels. Recent assessments comparing the Sasanians and Parthians have reaffirmed the superiority of Sasanian siegecraft, military engineering, and organization, as well as ability to build defensive works.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the mid-19th}} century, coyote fur was {{considered}} worthless. This <b>changed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> diminution of beavers, and by 1860, the hunting of coyotes for their fur became {{a great source}} of income (75 cents to $1.50 per skin) for wolfers in the Great Plains. Coyote pelts were of significant economic importance during the early 1950s, ranging in price from $5 to $25 per pelt, depending on locality. The coyote's fur is not durable enough to make rugs, but can be used for coats and jackets, scarves, or muffs. The majority of pelts are used for making trimmings, such as coat collars and sleeves for women's clothing. Coyote fur is sometimes dyed black as imitation silver fox.|$|E
5|$|Rip King and Fritz Pollard {{were named}} first-team all APFA and Alf Cobb was named second-team all APFA by the Rock Island Argus.

5|$|Sentiments <b>changed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> XYZ Affair. Adams {{appointed}} a three-member commission {{to represent the}} United States to negotiate with France. The commission consisted of John Marshall, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney and Elbridge Gerry. However, when the envoys arrived in October 1797, they were kept waiting for several days, and then granted only a 15-minute meeting with French Foreign Minister Talleyrand. After this, the diplomats were met by three of Talleyrand's agents. Each refused to conduct diplomatic negotiations unless the United States paid enormous bribes, one to Talleyrand personally, and another to the Republic of France. Supposedly this was {{to make up for}} offenses given to France by Adams in his speech. The Americans refused to negotiate on such terms. Marshall and Pinckney returned home, while Gerry remained.|$|E
5|$|The Metamorfosis World Tour was a {{worldwide}} concert tour by Guatemalan singer–songwriter Ricardo Arjona {{in support of}} his thirteenth studio album, Independiente. Beginning in January 2012, it was Arjona's first tour since leaving Warner Music to become an independent artist. The tour was announced in December 2011 with dates at American, Argentinian and Chilean venues, and received a positive critical response. The show was designed for a revolving stage, with Arjona performing while the scenery <b>changed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> songs being performed. Four changes of scenery were developed: a two-floor apartment, a bar, a circus and a theatre. The number of songs played at each show varied from 19 to 23.|$|E

Quarantine measures against ships coming from the Dutch Republic {{were put in place}} in 29 other ports from May, commencing with Great Yarmouth. The Dutch ambassador objected at the constraint of trade with his country, but England responded that it {{had been one of the}} last countries introducing such restrictions. Regulations were enforced quite strictly, so that people or houses where voyagers had come ashore without serving their quarantine were also subjected to 40 days quarantine.|$|E

5|$|The early {{farmers from}} the Early Basketmaker II Era, {{lived in the}} Petrified Forest from about 1CE to about 800CE. They {{occupied}} pit houses at fewer than 100 sites, at first on mesas or other vantage points and later {{at the base of}} bluffs and in lowlands, where the soil was better. As climatic conditions worsened for farming between 750 and 900CE, the settlements <b>changed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Pueblo I Era. Rather than below-ground pits, the Pueblo Builders constructed above-ground houses and storerooms that may have been capable of storing food for more than one year. At the same time, climatic conditions changed again, this time for the better, between 900 and 1275CE. More than 200 pueblo-builder sites have been identified in the park at a wide variety of locations—at the mouths of washes, near seeps, and on moisture-holding sand dunes.|$|E
5|$|The first 28 {{issues were}} 166 pages long. The page count dropped to 134 with the April 1954 issue and stayed at that length for the {{remainder}} of the run. The cover layout initially strongly resembled that of Other Worlds but was <b>changed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> fifth issue, June 1951, to have a white background banner for the title. This format was retained for the rest of the magazine's life, with occasional slight variations such as using a different color for the banner background. The spine also changed from a colored spine with pale lettering, which was similar to the spine style used by Other Worlds, to a white spine with red or blue lettering.|$|E
5|$|Though slavery persisted, {{some aspects}} of the {{relationship}} <b>changed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> French administration. Escaped slaves could find official protection by French authorities in the cities for a limited time. Slaves could sometimes renegotiate the terms of their servitude in the changed political situation. Some were willing to agree to remain in servitude if they received control over their family life and some land to pass to their children. In addition, the French administration actively worked to end slave raiding and the most clear manifestations of the slave trade, greatly reducing those means of acquiring slaves. However, for many decades after the 1905 abolition of slavery, the practice continued in much of French Sudan.|$|E
