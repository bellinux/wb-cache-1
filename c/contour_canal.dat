500|$|Contour canal: After {{numerous}} conquests and {{consolidation of}} his empire, China's first emperor Qin Shi Huang (r. 221–210 BC) commissioned the engineer Shi Lu {{to build a}} new waterway canal which would pass through a mountain range and connect the Xiang and Lijiang rivers. The result of this project was the Lingqu Canal, complete with thirty-six lock gates, and since it closely follows a contour line (i.e. following the contours of the natural saddle in the hills), it is the oldest known <b>contour</b> <b>canal</b> in the world.|$|E
2500|$|The affectionate, rhyming, name [...] "Curly Wyrley" [...] {{is derived}} {{from the fact that the}} canal is a <b>contour</b> <b>canal,</b> and so it twists and turns in order to avoid any gradients, and thus the need for locks.

50|$|In the United Kingdom, many of {{the canals}} built in the period from 1770 to 1800 were <b>contour</b> <b>canals</b> - for example, the Oxford Canal.

50|$|One {{historical}} landmark of {{the village}} is the Langwith Mill, located to the East {{of the village}}, exactly 26 miles from the City of Sheffield. The four-storey Cotton Mill was built in 1760, and its source of power came from the nearby River Poulter through a <b>contoured</b> <b>canal</b> from Langwith Lodge Lake. It {{was one of the}} largest mills in the district and was originally 16 windows wide. In 1848 cotton spinning was discontinued and in 1886 it was converted into a Corn Mill. Located alongside the mill was a large dam to store water, used to power the mill.|$|R
2500|$|The Oxford Canal was {{originally}} {{built as a}} <b>contour</b> <b>canal,</b> meaning that it twisted around hills to minimise vertical deviations from a level contour. However, with {{one eye on the}} developing railway network, in the 1820s the northern section of the canal between Braunston and Hawkesbury Junction was straightened out to reduce navigation time. This work reduced the distance by 14miles 6furlongs (23.7km). The section south of Napton was never straightened. The straightening challenged the capacity of three locks at Hillmorton, the first on the canal after the stop lock at Hawkesbury Junction. The solution to the congestion was to duplicate or twin the existing locks at Hillmorton, creating three pairs of two parallel narrow locks, which allowed for twice the traffic to pass the lock at any time. The work to double the locks was completed in August 1840. Not only was the capacity to pass the lock doubled, but the time taken was decreased as the locks were narrower. Tests showed that the locks could be operated in as little as one minute and 20 seconds! ...|$|E

50|$|As the Industrial Revolution {{took hold}} {{in the end of}} the 18th and {{beginning}} of the 19th century, the technology allowed canals to be improved. The early <b>canals</b> <b>contoured</b> round hills and valleys, later ones went straighter. Locks took canals up and down hills, and they strode across valleys on taller and longer aqueducts and through hills in longer and deeper tunnels.|$|R

5000|$|There is {{a cheaper}} {{possibility}} to pump {{water into the}} left canal when the reservoir water is below its sill level 490 ft MSL by using the reversible turbines (7 x 100 MW) of existing hydro power station on the left bank of the river. Water would be released into the down stream tail pond through the hydro power station or the existing diversion tunnel. When water is to be pumped into the left canal, the water released into the downstream tail pond is pumped back into a <b>contour</b> <b>canal</b> which connects the hydro power station and the left canal intake point. This <b>contour</b> <b>canal</b> is nearly 10 km long and located inside the Nagarjunasagar reservoir area situated at 510 ft MSL. Only three units of the reversible turbines are required to feed nearly 12,000 cusecs water to the left canal at its MDDL level and rest of four reversible units {{can be used for}} power generation by releasing water into the tail pond. The pen-stock inlets of the three unit at 125 m MSL are to be connected with the extension piping (4.8 m diameter) to feed the <b>contour</b> <b>canal</b> at 510 ft MSL. The extension piping is disconnected when water pumping to left canal is not required to restore the hydro power units normal working. When reservoir level is at its FRL level, the canal and the extension piping get submerged under water without undergoing any damage as the <b>contour</b> <b>canal</b> is away from the spillway of the dam or flood flow path. Thus both Telangana and AP states can use the reservoir dead storage water fully to ensure water supply for the command area under the left canal even during drought years.|$|E

50|$|The Nagarjuna Sagar left canal is {{presently}} supplying nearly 130 TMC water for irrigation needs in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh states.

This canal {{can be used for}} transferring nearly 80 TMC Godavari river water into the Nagarjuna Sagar reservoir in addition to supplying the Godavari water under its entire command area. Thus total 210 TMC Godavari water can be used in the Krishna basin of Telangana state from Srisailam and Jurala reservoirs for the new projects with 100% water dependability. Godavari water transferred into Nagarjuna Sagar reservoir/Krishna main river can also be used for the proposed Palamuru lift irrigation and Nakkalagandi lift irrigation schemes in Telangana.|$|R
50|$|The Union Canal {{was built}} as a <b>contour</b> or {{mathematical}} <b>canal</b> and is approximately 52 km in length, following the 240 feet (73 m) contour throughout, thereby avoiding the need for locks but lacking this means of restricting water loss {{in the event of}} a breach. For safety the engineers between 1818 and 1822 provided gates in case of structural failures and for canal maintenance using single leaf, timber gates at nineteen locations. Scottish Canals have had two timber bridge hole gates made to the original design and dimensions for installation at Linlithgow.|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{sustainable}} watershed management, natural fibers mixed with soil have applications in irrigation and drainage projects such as river levees, <b>contour</b> bunds, temporary <b>canal</b> diversion works, temporary check dams, soil structures, stream restoration, etc., for controlling seepage. In this study, a number of experiments were carried out for determining the seepage velocity and piping resistance {{of different types of}} soils mixed randomly with coir fibers. Three types of soils are used in this study. The experiments were carried out for various hydraulic heads, fiber contents, and fiber lengths. Discharge velocity and seepage velocity of flow of water through soil is calculated in each case and compared with plain soil. It is observed that fibers reduce the seepage velocity of plain soil considerably and thus increase the piping resistance of soil. Regression equations based on experiments are developed for quantifying the seepage velocity and piping resistance considering hydraulic gradient, fiber contents, and fiber lengths. Suitability of coir fibers for field applications with typical examples is also highlighted. The results show that coir fiber mixed soil can be used to increase the piping resistance and reduce seepage velocity in the above mentioned applications...|$|R
50|$|During {{the drought}} year 2015, the inflows into the {{reservoir}} were very meagre due to failure of rains in the catchment area. However nearly 18 tmcft dead storage water {{available in the}} reservoir {{could not be used}} for the dire needs. With minor external modifications to the exiting reversible hydro turbine unit, most of the dead storage water can be put to use during the drought years by using the hydro power plant for pumping water into the nearby right canal. Water would be released downstream into the tail pond over the spillway (if needed by siphon pipes). Nearly five km long <b>contour</b> <b>canal</b> at MDDL of the right canal in the reservoir area is constructed to connect the power house area with the right canal intake point. The pen stock of the hydro power unit is extended (less than 100 m long) to connect to the <b>contour</b> <b>canal.</b> The hydro power unit is operated in pumping mode to pump water from the tail pond to the right canal when the reservoir level is below the canal's minimum draw down level (MDDL). The pen stock extension piping is detached when water pumping to the canal is not required to restore its normal power generation when the reservoir level is above the right canal's MDDL When the reservoir level is above the right canal MDDL level, the <b>contour</b> <b>canal</b> located in the reservoir area gets submerged with out suffering any damage as it is not obstructing the flood flow to the dam spillway.|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Chaco Canyon, the Pueblo settlement of New Mexico, represents one of the major cultural developments in the prehistoric Southwest. Between A. D. 900 and A. D. 1100 Chaco reached its peak of cultural florescence. This period was characterized by considerable building activities, appearance of Chaco outliers, and the construction of an extensive road system. After this period a dramatic decline in population and a cessation of building activity took place. Archaeologists call this phenomenon abandonment. In general, development and abandonment of Chaco Canyon coincided with changes in climatic conditions. Between A. D. 900 and A. D. 1100 there was a gradual increase in effective moisture and warmer temperature which proved favorable for agriculture there. With these optimal climatic conditions,development of Chaco Canyon witnessed a great increase in population. However, the Chaco Canyon region could not support a large population indefinitely because of its agricultural marginality. To solve this population-resource imbalance, Chacoan farmers of this period intensified their agricultural activities by constructing water control systems such as check dams, <b>contour</b> terraces, <b>canals,</b> and ditches. These measures worked for a while and the influence of Chaco Canyon was felt in the political, economic, and religious life of a broad geographic region. However, summer moisture began to decrease in the years between A. D. 1130 and A. D. 1180. This decrease became a full scale drought from A. D. 1157 to A. D. 1179 that seems to have severely affected agriculture and wild food resources available for the Chacoans. In addition, the Chacoan water control system designed to capture runoff probably proved to be inadequate as a buffering mechanism. Consequently, population at Chaco Canyon began to decrease and the region was abandoned after A. D. 1140. In an attempt at explaining the specific abandonment of Chaco Canyon, this thesis focuses on relationship between prehistoric agriculture and environment...|$|R
40|$|In {{cases of}} severe {{rheumatoid}} arthritis or osteoarthritis, the hip joint is substituted by an artificial joint {{composed of a}} femoral stem fitted with a spherical head that can rotate inside a cup inserted in the acetabulum. This procedure is called total hip replacement (THR) {{and is one of}} the most frequently performed orthopaedic surgeries. For a cementless femoral implant, the fixation is achieved by preparing a slightly undersized bone bed, and the implant is forcefully hammered into the bone. The initial stability at the time of surgery is one of the most important factors to establish long survival of the implant. With each surgical hammer blow, the fixation of the implant in the bone increases. However, introducing an implant with a diameter wider than the bone’s inner <b>canal</b> <b>contour</b> (i. e. press fit) introduces stresses in the cortical bone which can cause femoral fracture. In response to mechanical excitations (i. e. hammer blows or external vibrations), a femur-implant structure will display vibration modes and frequencies, just like any other mechanical structure. Changes in material properties or boundary conditions of a femur-implant structure will change its vibration modes and frequencies, which can be obtained numerically and experimentally. Therefore, this chapter explains how to perform vibration analysis on a THR component (i. e. the femoral implant) in order to assess femur-implant stability, as well as how to analyze, present, and interpret results. status: accepte...|$|R
