This paper investigates the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) of four AHSS steels. The behavior of one TRIP, two martensitic with different strength levels and one hot stamping steels have been studied using Slow Strain Rate Tensile (SSRT) tests on electrochemically hydrogenated notched samples. The embrittlement susceptibility of these AHSS steels has been correlated mainly to their strength level and to their microstructural features.

Worldwide economic cost of road crashes {{is estimated to be}} around US$ 518 billion each year. Road accidents occur due to a number of factors including driver behaviour, geometric alignment, vehicle characteristics, environmental impacts, and the type and condition of the road surfacing. Skid resistance {{is considered one of the}} most important road surface characteristics because it has a direct effect on traffic safety. In 2005, Austroads (the Association of Australian and New Zealand Road Transport and Traffic Authorities) published a guideline for the management of skid resistance and Queensland Department of Main Roads (QDMR) developed a skid resistance management plan (SRMP). The current QDMR strategy is based on rationale analytical methodology supported by field inspection with related asset management decision tools. The Austroads’s guideline and QDMR's skid resistance management plan have prompted QDMR to review its skid resistance management practice. As a result, a joint research project involving QDMR, Queensland University of Technology (QUT) and the Corporative Research Centre for Integrated Engineering Asset Management (CRC CIEAM) was formed. The research project aims at investigating whether there is significant relationship between road <b>crashes</b> and skid <b>resistance</b> on Queensland’s road networks.

40|$|The use {{of various}} moving average (MA) rules remains popular with {{financial}} market practitioners. These rules have recently {{become the focus}} of a number empirical studies, but there have been very few studies of financial market models where some agents employ technical trading rules of the type used in practice. In this paper we propose a dynamic financial market model in which demand for traded assets has both a fundamentalist and a chartist component. The chartist demand is governed by the difference between current price and a (long-run) MA. Both types of traders are boundedly rational in the sense that, based on a fitness measure such as realized capital gains, traders switch from a strategy with low fitness to the one with high fitness. We characterize the stability and bifurcation properties of the underlying deterministic model via the reaction coefficient of the fundamentalists, the extrapolation rate of the chartists and the lag length used for the MA. By increasing the intensity of choice to switching strategies, we then examine various rational routes to randomness for different MA rules. The price dynamics of the moving average rule are also examined and one of our main findings is that an increase of the window length of the MA rule can destabilize an otherwise stable system, leading to more complicated, even chaotic behaviour. The analysis of the corresponding stochastic model is able to explain various market price phenomena, including temporary bubbles, sudden market <b>crashes,</b> price <b>resistance</b> and price switching between different levels.

After this fan blade out (FBO) phenomenon, several engine components made out of titanium alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V can undergo a violent <b>crash.</b> Their <b>resistance</b> in this situation is simulated by numerical tools using very restrictive hypothesis. More realistic material constitutive models would lead to a better engine design, thus to mass reduction. The elasto-viscoplastic behavior of the alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V material produced under conditions near representative of a blade has been analyzed, {{based on the results of}} mechanical tests. A focus was made on the influence of test temperature, strain rate, material direction, and stress state. A rate dependent strain hardening law, based on the Kocks-Mecking formalism, has been identified. The analysis of the fracture strains and fracture surfaces have shown the influence of the experimental conditions on the damage process and highlighted the impact of the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V two phase nature. X-ray microtomography observations during tensile loading provided a quantitative analysis of the nucleation and growth of the voids, with the help of a cavity tracking algorithm. Finally, a viscoplastic Gurson-based damage model has been developed, based on finite element void cell calculations and experimental results, and the predictions have been assessed.

40|$|A new {{austenitic}} {{cast steel}} from the type X 4 CrMnNi 16 7 6 or X 4 CrMnNi 16 7 7 is presented. The steel has {{a relatively low}} stability of the austenite {{with respect to the}} martensitic transformation to the e- and a´-martensite phase and a relatively slow stacking fault energy to ist chemical composition. Both influencing variables cause a TRIP/TWIP effect (Transformation Induced Plasticity/Twinning Induced Plasticity) under load conditions. The cast steel can be excellent cold formed, because the plasticity effects are triggered at room temperature, despite of a gross primary microstructure and dendrite structure. It is shown, that through drawing and rolling high deformation degrees can be reached without any intermediate annealing. The cast steel work hardens by the cold forming. The steel forms deformation martensite and/or deformation twins. It can be recrystallized which can be used for the improvement of the cast structure. The strength properties increase significantly {{at the expense of the}} ductility properties by a plastic prestrain at room temperature.

Because of the size effects, local material relation determined with experiments is not applicable to large shell elements. Therefore, a numerical method is outlined to determine the effect of element size on the macroscopic response of large structural shell elements until fracture initiation. Macroscopic response is determined by introducing averaging unit into the numerical model over which volume averaged equivalent stress and plastic strain are evaluated. Three different stress states are considered in this investigation: uniaxial, plane strain and equi-biaxial tension. The results demonstrate that fracture strain is highly sensitive to size effects in uniaxial tension whereas in plane strain or equi-biaxial tension size effects are much weaker.

40|$|AbstractA strong {{issue on}} the {{development}} of new vehicles is the weight reduction, required for the reduction of the fuel consumption and the CO 2 emissions. The current vehicles have already a structure optimised to have low weight without reducing the required performances. However, there are some components of the structure that can be further reduced in weight still matching the <b>resistance,</b> <b>crash</b> and fatigue performances, but giving a poor performance in terms of noise and vibrations and increasing both the structure-borne and air-borne sound transmission.

Among others, shunted piezoelectric patches and electro-magnetic actuation as well as smart Helmholtz resonators are considered. Additionally, dedicated active noise control systems for the control of broadband rolling noise are developed. Besides, Green City Car addresses and implements novel damping materials and acoustic treatments as well as design approaches for tyres which are an important acoustic source for exterior and interior noise. This holistic approach should lead to a reduction in noise and vibrations levels in the order of 10 dB(A) and more measurable in the city car provided (not on component level).

Reducing accident rates and crash severity are imperative goals that governments, road and transport authorities, and researchers are aimed to achieve.

Serious injury cases can cost the taxpayer {{many times the}} cost of a fatality. Crashes are in general uncontrolled events and are dependent on a number of interrelated factors such as driver behaviour, traffic conditions, travel speed, road geometry and condition, and vehicle characteristics (e. g. tyre type pressure and condition, and suspension type and condition).

40|$|Introduction The study aims at {{identifying}} traffic/highway design/driver-vehicle information {{significantly related}} with fatal/severe crashes on urban arterials for different crash types. Since the data {{used in this}} study are observational (i. e., collected outside the purview of a designed experiment), an information discovery approach is adopted for this study. Method Random Forests, which are ensembles of individual trees grown by CART (Classification and Regression Tree) algorithm, are applied in numerous applications for this purpose. Specifically, conditional inference forests have been implemented. In each tree of the conditional inference forest, splits are based on how good the association is. Chi-square test statistics are used to measure the association. Apart from identifying the variables that improve classification accuracy, the methodology also clearly identifies the variables that are neutral to accuracy, and also those that decrease it. Results The methodology is quite insightful in identifying the variables of interest in the database (e. g., alcohol/ drug use and higher posted speed limits contribute to severe crashes). Failure to use safety equipment by all passengers and presence of driver/passenger in the vulnerable age group (more than 55 years or less than 3 years) increased the severity of injuries given a crash had occurred. A new variable, ‘element’ has been {{used in this study}}, which assigns crashes to segments, intersections, or access points based on the information from site location, traffic control, and presence of signals.

5000|$|... 1958 was won by Briton Tony Brooks, {{driving a}} Vanwall; beating out {{teammate}} Stirling Moss. The prestigious Belgian event was not run in 1959, but 1960 {{was to be}} one of the darkest weekends in the history of Formula One. Grand Prix racing had moved forward to a new kind of car design - new British independent teams such as Cooper and Lotus had pioneered the rear-mid-engined car, much like the Auto Union Grand Prix cars of the 1930s. These cars were considerably lighter, faster and easier to drive than their front-engined predecessors, and it became obvious that rear-mid-engined cars were the way to go in purpose-built automobile racing. But this new type of cars had not been driven at Spa before, so no one knew how they would perform there. The high-speed bends at Spa were now much faster with these new cars - and in those days, the cars or circuits for that matter had absolutely no safety features of any kind. The cylinder-shaped bodywork was made of very thin highly flammable magnesium and/or fibreglass, and the tube-frame chassis of that day offered little to no <b>crash</b> <b>resistance</b> (as opposed to a modern-day monocoque, pioneered by Lotus only a few years later). Cars were not crash-tested and didn't have any installed equipment such as roll bars (made mandatory in 1961) or fire extinguishers. Although drivers did wear helmets, they were shaped like paper plates, made of weak and lightweight material and not scientifically designed or tested. Drivers in those days did not even wear seatbelts - they found it preferable to be thrown from a car that might be on fire to reduce the chance of injury or death.|$|E
40|$|High {{friction}} {{response in}} pavement improves road safety, while reduced noise production from the tire-pavement interface benefits {{public health and}} the economy of a country. According to Transport Canada, highway crashes cost Canadians approximately $ 67 billion annually. The economic impact of noise is difficult to quantify; however, billions of dollars have been invested in noise barriers as noise mitigation alternatives. Roadway safety is related to many factors including the friction characteristics or skid resistance of pavements. Lack of sufficient friction at the tire-pavement interface is a significant contributing factor to vehicle <b>crashes.</b> Skid <b>resistance</b> of pavement is affected by both: the microtexture of the pavement as related to the fine and coarse aggregate properties in the mortar phase of the concrete mixture; and by the macrotexture, which is defined as the measurable grooves formed in the plastic concrete during the finishing operation, or created in the hardened pavement with cutting heads consisting of uniformly spaced circular diamond saw blades. Traffic noise is also a growing concern for {{public health and the}} country’s economy. Tire-pavement noise predominates over the other sources of roadway noise in many circumstances. Under accelerating conditions, the tire-pavement noise is dominant at speeds greater than 35 to 45 km/h for cars, and 45 to 55 km/h for trucks. Although the tire-pavement noise is generated through a variety of mechanisms at the tire-pavement contact patch, it is recognized that a proper design of Portland cement concrete (PCC) pavement surface may assist in reducing noise levels and thus has prompted the evaluation of new macrotextures. However, an optimization process must be carried out to achieve adequate friction while reducing noise generation through macrotexture because large macrotexture can increase friction and generate excessive noise due to an inadequate tire-pavement interaction. Next Generation Concrete Surface (NGCS) is the first new concrete pavement texture introduced in the United States in the last 20 to 30 years. NGCS also has the quietest texture developed for conventional concrete pavements, mainly through macrotexture modification. The construction process uses conventional diamond grinding equipment, but the blades have a different configuration in the drum. Currently, after the evaluations of long term pavement performance and noise characteristics of the NGCS, concerns have been reported regarding durability and increased noise level over time. In this research, a laboratory investigation examined how friction, noise absorption, and surface durability can be improved by modifying the concrete microtexture. The innovative approach of this research involved investigating those properties of concrete pavement through microtexture modification using nanotechnology. Nanotechnology involves manipulating materials at scales below 100 nm. Two different products were investigated: nanosilica applied in the cement paste, and a nano lotus leaf solution applied as a coating to mimic the lotus leaf effect. Several concrete mixes were prepared and tested in the laboratory. Results reveal that microtexture modification through the addition of nanosilica can change the properties of fresh concrete, hardened concrete, and concrete durability. In fresh concrete, the main findings indicate that nanosilica reduces the concrete slump and also reduces the air content for a given water cement ratio; however, the slump and air content can be adjusted using High Range Water Reduced and Air Entraining Admixtures. In hardened concrete, results reveal that a small amount of nanosilica can accelerate the hydration process and enhance the compressive strength and the friction response. Results also reveal that nanosilica cannot significantly modify the sound absorption coefficient. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images in hardened concrete provide insight into the impact that the nanosilica has on the Interfacial Transition Zone (ITZ). Nanosilica can reduce ettringite crystal formation in voids and can also produce a denser and a more compact cement paste. Regarding durability, several abrasion tests using the rotating cutter method indicate that nanosilica can enhance the concrete’s abrasion response, resulting in better wear resistance and durability of PCC road surfaces. Freezing and thawing, and scaling resistance results show that nanoconcrete is able to reduce the external damage on the PCC surface. Regarding the coating mimicking the lotus leaf effect, several concrete mixes were prepared and tested in the laboratory. Visual inspections demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} create the lotus leaf effect on concrete surfaces. Laboratory results reveal that the coating is able to maintain the friction response of concrete surfaces; however, results also reveal that the sound absorption coefficient is not significantly affected by the coating. Further research must be done to determine the coating impact on the hydroplaning effect when a heavy rainfall is present...|$|R

Skid resistance values found in older design manuals were typically based on studies where the worst case scenarios of bald tires, smooth pavement and wet conditions were used. The graphs depicting these values were first published in the AASHTO Policy for the Geometric Design of Rural Highways, 1954. In the AASHTO Policy for the Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, 2001, skid resistance ceased to define braking distance (the second component of Stopping Sight Distance) and a standard deceleration of 3. 4 m/s 2, based on comfort, became the design norm at all speeds. These design values are of little use in the reconstruction of <b>crashes.</b> The skid <b>resistance</b> for specific scenarios must be determined. Values obtained from published sources can serve as guidance to orders of magnitude and as reference values. The stopping -performance of modern cars under ideal conditions {{can be in the}} order of 8 to 9 m/s 2. With GPS loggers and accelerometers now generally available, field tests can be done with similar vehicles under comparable conditions {{at a fraction of the}} cost of the formal testing equipment. The acceptance of these values has not been tested in court and the credibility of the results will have to be agreed by the experts acting for the Court or be tried by the court based on the facts presented. Values for road surfaces contaminated by gravel (sand to stone chips) could not be found in literature. Tests, using a Race Technology DL 1 data logger with accelerometer, were conducted on a good gravel road and on an abandoned section of sealed road with sand and crushed stone gravel on. All the tests were done in dry conditions. The gravel roads were included to establish a measure of comparison. The skid resistance of the gravel roads were found to be 0. 53 to 0. 63. The skid resistance of the sealed road with sand contamination were found to be between 0. 36 and 0. 44. The skid resistance of 13. 2 mm and 6. 7 mm stone used for seal resurfacing on the sealed road varied between 0. 37 and 0. 47. The skid resistance of dry gravel roads and surface roads contaminated with sand and gravel are still greater than the comfort-based design value of 0. 35. This does not imply that such areas are safe for all vehicles (motorcycle and bicycles being especially vulnerable). The skid resistances of surfaced contaminated roads do not meet the brake performance of 4. 4 m/s 2 (skid resistance of 0. 44) required in the National Road Traffic Act, Act 93 of 1996.

40|$|In {{the early}} {{phases of the}} product {{development}} process, the initial product geometry can be a non-divided shape, just a shell. This initial product geometry has to be divided into individual parts in order to manufacture and fulfil the functionality of the product. In the case of automobiles, these parts can be fenders, doors, hoods, etc. The design of the parts is influenced by several aspects, like design language, geometrical dimensioning, <b>crash</b> safety, wind <b>resistance,</b> etc. The decisions regarding how to divide and design the parts are made in multidisciplinary teams. The final appearance of the spatial relations between the parts, i. e. the split-lines, in an assembly affects the quality appearance of the product. This in turn influences the sales of the product. By supporting the product development process with methods, tools and guidelines, {{the quality of the}} final solution will improve. The focus of the presented research has been on how to split the initial product geometry in order to achieve a geometrically and visually robust solution. In other terms, it has been on how the split-line shall be designed and placed in order to achieve as geometrically and visually robust solution as possible. Geometrical robustness aims at the dimensional and functional aspects of the product. Visual robustness is more concerned with the aesthetic aspects of the product. A geometrically and visually robust solution suppresses part and assembly variation. This leads to a decreased geometrical output variation, the variation between parts the customer sees. A geometrically robust solution often results in a visually robust solution. A geometrically sensitive solution, on the other hand, can be made visually acceptable in some cases by controlling the position and the direction of the split-line. Different areas are more or less sensitive for the eye. The research results have contributed to an enhanced knowledge and a supporting tool in the area of geometrical and visual robustness. The tool supports the division of initial product geometry with respect to geometrical robustness. The enhanced knowledge enlightens how different assembly aspects influence the final result when assembling. There is also a contribution concerning customers and the industrys attitude regarding the visual quality appearance of split-lines. It concerns more the aesthetic aspects of the split-line design. The conclusion of the presented research project is that the division of the initial product geometry, in order to achieve a geometrically and visually robust solution, is influenced by many aspects. These aspects can sometimes be antagonists and there have to be a compromise between them. Also, the tool presented does calculate and visualize robust areas between two geometries to be split and this result can hopefully be used as a support in the product development process. The customers consider high visual quality of split-lines as important and that narrow split-lines is of importance for the perceived quality but there is other factors that is influencing the quality appearance of split-lines. By using the presented tool and by using the knowledge, gained from this research project, the chances of creating products with high visual quality will increase with decreased cost and time for the product development process...|$|R
