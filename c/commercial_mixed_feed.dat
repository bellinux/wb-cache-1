40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to identify the structural characteristics and profitability of Japanese Black Cattle feeding management in Kagoshima Prefecture, a main cattle feeding province in Japane. In this study, special attention has been focused on, (1) production costs and profitability, (2) factors contributing to profitability, and (3) estimation of production functions for beef production. The data used in this study were farm records of the Survey on Production Costs for Japanese Black Cattle for Fattening (fattening of castrated young cattle) in Kagoshima Pref., which was conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan (MAFFJ) in 1980. The results of this study can be summarized as follows: 1. Average herd size for cattle feeding operations was 6. 5 heads in 1982. Over two-thirds of the perators managed only one or two heads, and, less than 7. 7 percent of the operators had herds of 20 or more. 2. In 1980, the average fattening period was 15. 8 months and the daily gain was 0. 65 kg. Feed conversion tended to increase as herd size increased, and average feed conversion was 8. 5. 3. Cattle feeding operators in this area tended to use more feed per unit of live weight than the national average level, including both <b>commercial</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>feed</b> and self-supplied roughage. This feeding system resulted in low profitability in this area. 4. It was found that extending the fattening period did not always increase profitability. Profitability was found to be largely influenced by price fluctuations in feeder cattle and dressed carcasses. 5. High labor returns per day were accounted for by high values of the ratio of fed cattle price to total production cost, and vice versa. In order to increase profitability, cattle feeding operators in this area must decrease production costs by substituting roughage for concentrate. 6. The estimated elasticities for feeder cattle, feed, labor hour, and replacement reserve, estimated using tha Cobb-Douglas production function, were 0. 5959, 0. 2278, 0. 1324, and 0. 0576, respectively. The marginal productiviry of feeder cattle indicated that increaseing feeder cattle investment by one thousand yen increased gross income by 1, 409 yen. This suggests that selecting good feeder cattle is very important for increasing profitability in Japanese Black Cattle feeding management. 本稿では,和牛肥育経営の経済性を明らかにするために,全国最大の和牛産地である鹿児島県を中心として, (1) 生産費の構造と収益性, (2) 収益性影響要因,(3) 生産関数の計測に焦点をあてながら分析してきた. 資料は 1980 年の農林水産省｢肥育牛(黒毛和種の去勢若齢肥育) 生産費個表｣鹿児島県分である. 分析結果は以下のとおりである. (1) 鹿児島県における和牛肥育の概況を検討すると, 1982 年現在 8, 312 経営が 54, 440 頭を飼養し, 1 戸当たりの規模は 6. 5 頭である. しかし, 1 - 2 頭規模が 68. 4 %と大半を占め, 20 頑以上規模は 7, 7 %にすぎない. (2) 1980 年時点で肥育期間は 15. 8 か月,D. Gは 0. 65 kg,飼料要求率は 8. 5 である. 飼料要求率は大規模はど大きい傾向にあり,大規模経営における濃厚飼料依存度が高いことを示唆した. (3) 1 頭当たり第 2 次生産費は 604, 391 円,所得は 112, 872 円, 1 日当たり家族労働報酬は 6, 065 円である. 価格･生産費比率は 1. 03 と九州(1. 08) 及び全国(1. 10) 水準より低かった. 鹿児島県の場合他地域に比べて総じて生産費が高く収益性が低いが,その主な要因は自給粗飼料と購入濃厚飼料の代替が円滑でなく,配合飼料への依存度が高いにもかかわらずそれが省力化及び増体効率の改善に結びつかないところにあると思われる. (4) 肥育期間の延長と出荷体重の増大は必ずしも肉質の改善や収益性の向上に寄与していないように思われる. 素牛の価格変動や枝肉単価の変動は収益性に重大な影響を及ぼすことがわかった. (5) 価格･生産費比率は 1 日当たり家族労働報酬の有力な説明要因であり,肥育期間の延長はD. Gの減少をもたらすことが確認できた. 所得向上は相反する 2 つの要因,生産費の節減と販売価格の向上の適正均衡によって達成できる. (6) 粗収益を従属変数としたコブ･ダグラス型生産関数の計測結果によれば,生産弾性値は素牛費が 0. 5959 と最も大きく, その次が飼料費 0. 2278,労働時間 0. 1324, 流動資本財費 0. 0576 であった. パラメーターの推定値の和は 1. 0137 であったが,検定結果規模の経済性の存在の有無は立証できなかった. 一方,限界生産力の分析結果によると素牛費千円の追加的増加は 1, 409 円の租収益増加をもたらし,素質のよい素牛の購入が和牛肥育経営において非常に重要であることを示唆した...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze the structural characteristics of the Japanese Black Calf raising in the Handa Central Area of Kyushu. A large scale agricultural development project is now progressed in the area that covers 4 districts such as Shonai,Yufuin,Kokonoe and Kusu in Oita Prefecture. In this study, special attention has been focused on, (1) production cost and feed utilization, (2) profitability and productivity and (3) comparative aspects with the Japanese Brown Calf raising of the Aso district in Kumamoto Pref. The data used in this study were farm records of the Kusu and the Aso districts for the period 1976 - 80 from the Survey on Production Cost of Japanese Calves conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan (MAFFJ). The results of this study can be summarized as follows: 1. Almost 94 percent of beef cattle producers in 1980 followed the cow-calf system of cattle raising. But most of cow-calf operations were small scale and tota 1 number of cows has decreased since recently. 2. Cow-calf operaters tended to use a shorter raising period than operators in other regions up to 1 month or shorter. Calf price per kilogram was higher than Japanese Brown Calf but lower than national average level. 3. About 48 percent of the production cost per cow has been accounted for by family labor cost and it was higher than any other region. This was caused by large labor use for feed processing. 4. On feed utilization, cow-calf operators preferred to purchase crops, rice bran and wheat bran rather than <b>commercial</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>feed.</b> This feeding system was contrastive to other regions which largely depended on commercial mixed. The preference for crops,rice bran and wheat bran in this area seemed to be caused by their low prices. But it increased the labor hours after all, since these items were manually mixed or processed by family labor with inefficient implements. 5. In 1980, average income per cow was 148, 338 yen which was higher than the Aso district (90, 310 yen) and the national average level (147, 477 yen). But, labor earning per day was only 2, 276 yen which was higher than the Aso district (1, 512 yen) and lower than the national level (3, 936 yen). Labor earning per day in this area became small in response to large labor hours, whereas income was in the highest level. 6. Cow-calf raising in this area was found to be characterized by labor intensive and capital saving methods, whereas that in the Aso district was characterized by capital intensive and labor saving methods. In labor productivity, this area was inferior to the Aso district. In order to increase the profitability and the labor productivity, cow-calf operators should make effortsto save labor hours by the scale enlargement. Also for this, enlargement of pasture and the investment of capital in farm machineries and associated implements are necessary. 本稿では，広域農業開発事業が進められている九州高原地帯の阿蘇久住飯田地域の飯旧中央地区(大分県庄内，湯布院，九重，玖珠の 4 町) における黒毛和種子牛生産の構造的特徴を明らかにするために， (1) 子牛の生産費及び飼料構造， (2) 子牛生産の収益性及び生産性に重点をおいて分析してきた. 分析過程において同地区の黒毛和種と阿蘇地域(熊本県) の褐毛和種との比較も行なった. 資料ば 1976 - 80 年の農林水産省「和子牛生産費個表」玖珠町と阿蘇町分である. 分析結果以下のことが指摘される. (1) 1980 年現在飯田中央地区肉用牛生産農家の 94 ％が子牛生産経営であり，同地区繁殖牛頭数は大分県の約 3 分の 1 を占める. しかし戸当たり繁殖牛頭数は 2. 3 頭で零細であり，近年同地区の繁殖牛頭数は一部先進地域を除けば激しい減少傾向にある. (2) 玖珠町の子牛出荷は他地域に比べて早い傾向がある. 同町のほ育・育成期間は 249 日であり，阿蘇町より 2 か月， 大分県及び全国平均より 1 か月も短い. 一方，玖珠町は子牛単価において阿蘇町の褐毛和種と全国平均水準とのほぼ中聞に位置する. (3) 玖珠町における子午生産費構造の大きな特徴は家族労働費が非常に大きいことであるが(費用合計の 48 %) ， これは飼料構造とりわけ飼料の調理・給与・給水作業時間が多いことに起因する. (4) 玖珠町の飼料構造の特徴は，配合錦料の購入が少なく，その代わりに穀類及びぬか・ふすま類の購入が多いこと，エンシレージ及び野生草の利用が多いことである. 十分な機械設備を備えていない条件の下で，割安な穀類及びぬか・ふすま類を購入し自家混配 1, 512 円よりは高いものの全国 3, 936 円よりはるかに低い. 子午の価格差は品種間及び地域聞の収益格差のたきな要因である. (6) 玖珠町は子牛生産において労働集約的かっ資本節約的であり，阿蘇町は資本集約的かっ労働節約的であるといえる. 1980 年現在玖珠町の子牛生産の労働生産性は時間当たり 440 円であり阿蘇町 544 円より低い. 玖珠町の場合今後収益性向上のためには，規模拡大のもとに機械設備投資及び粗飼料基盤拡充による省力化で，資本装備率と土地構成を高め，労働生産性の高度化を図らなければならない. 一方，阿蘇町は固定資本の効率的運用による資本生産性の向上が粗飼料基盤の拡充とともに要請される...|$|E

Twelve lactating ewes were divided into four groups, fed hay and, according to a 4 × 4 Latin square design, supplied with 800 g/day of a <b>commercial</b> <b>mixed</b> concentrate <b>feed</b> (MCF) containing maize and soybean, or {{the same amount of}} isoprotein concentrates consisting of chickpea (CH), faba bean (FB), or pea (PE) mixed with barley. The ewes ingested more of the concentrates with legume grains than the MCF (702, 702, 678 vs 587 g/day DM for CH, FB, PE and MCF; P ≤ 0. 001). Compared with CH, FB and PE resulted in greater (P ≤ 0. 05) milk yield (710, 718 vs 654 g/day for FB, PE and CH, respectively), and led to a greater (P ≤ 0. 05) efficiency of dietary protein utilisation for milk casein synthesis (94, 97 vs 87 g casein/kg crude protein intake for FB, PE and CH, respectively), whereas MCF resulted in intermediate levels of milk yield (677 g/day) and milk casein/crude protein intake (88 g/kg). Chickpea increased the milk content of trans-vaccenic and rumenic acids in comparison with FB and PE and, similarly to MCF, increased the milk content of linoleic acid, as well as total unsaturated fatty acids (24. 3, 23. 9 vs 17. 2, 16. 8 g/ 100 g fatty acid methyl esters for MCF, CH, FB and PE; P ≤ 0. 001), thereby improving the potential health-promoting index.

According to this hypothesis, babies with breastfeeding have suckling movements at the breast that are different from the movements of suckling a teat of babies fed with bottle. Children with <b>mixed</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>mix</b> both types of suckling movements. Methods Cross-sectional study of infants aged 21 - 28 days with only maternal feeding or bottle feeding (234 mother-infant pairs), and a randomized open cross-over field trial in newborns aged 21 - 28 days and babies aged 3 - 5 months with <b>mixed</b> <b>feeding</b> (125 mother-infant pairs).

40|$|Abstract Background Women gain {{total body}} weight and accrue body fat during pregnancy. Breastfeeding has been {{suggested}} as an efficient means of promoting postpartum weight loss due to its high energy cost. We investigated the effect of infant feeding mode on maternal body composition. Methods This study evaluated maternal weight and percent body fat changes in exclusively breastfeeding versus <b>mixed</b> <b>feeding</b> mothers during the first 12 weeks postpartum using the BOD POD. Twenty four mothers aged 19 – 42 years were studied. Participants were recruited from Athens-Clarke County and surrounding areas of the State of Georgia, USA. The study was conducted between November 2005 and December 2006. Results Prepregnancy weight was higher in <b>mixed</b> <b>feeding</b> mothers than in exclusively breastfeeding mothers (68. 4 kg vs. 61. 4 kg) but {{the difference was not}} statistically significant. At 12 weeks postpartum, exclusively breastfeeding mothers had lost more total body weight than <b>mixed</b> <b>feeding</b> mothers (4. 41 ± 4. 10 kg versus 2. 79 ± 3. 09 kg; p = 0. 072). There {{was no significant difference in}} fat weight change between the two groups (4. 38 ± 2. 06 kg versus 4. 17 ± 2. 63 kg). However, <b>mixed</b> <b>feeding</b> mothers lost slightly more percent body fat than exclusively breastfeeding mothers (1. 90 ± 4. 18 kg versus 1. 71 ± 3. 48 kg), but the difference was not statistically significant. The trend in percent body fat loss was significant among exclusively breastfeeding mothers (p = 0. 034) but not <b>mixed</b> <b>feeding</b> mothers (p = 0. 081). Exclusively breastfeeding mothers consumed more calories than <b>mixed</b> <b>feeding</b> mothers (1980 ± 618 kcal versus 1541 ± 196 kcal p = 0. 08). Physical activity levels were, however, higher in <b>mixed</b> <b>feeding</b> mothers than exclusively breastfeeding mothers. Conclusion Our results provide further evidence that exclusive breastfeeding promotes greater weight loss than <b>mixed</b> <b>feeding</b> among mothers even in the early postpartum period. This suggests that there is the need to encourage mothers to exclusively breastfeed as a means of overweight and obesity prevention. </p...|$|R

The best model of trait change had transitions from browsers to grazers via <b>mixed</b> <b>feeding,</b> with appreciable rates of transition to and from grazing and <b>mixed</b> <b>feeding.</b> Diversification rates in mixed-feeder and grazer lineages tracked the palaeotemperature curve, exhibiting higher rates during the Miocene thermal maxima.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{external}} mass transfer, competitive adsorption and coking on hydrogen permeation through thin Pd/Ag membranes has been evaluated {{by means of}} comparisons between experimental and predicated data at temperatures of 548 - 723 K and a total pressure of 2 bar. Predicted data were obtained by solving a mathematical model {{taking into account the}} effect of external mass transfer on hydrogen permeation only and verified from permeation experiments with a mixture feed of H 2 -N 2. It was found that steam and CO have significant inhibitive effects on hydrogen permeation through the membrane due to their competitive adsorption with hydrogen on the metallic surface at temperatures less than 623 K, whereas, CO 2 displayed only slight inhibitive effect at these temperatures. The effect increased with the amount of steam, CO or CO 2 in the <b>mixed</b> <b>feed,</b> and decreased with temperature. Only very slight effects from steam and CO were noted at temperatures higher than 673 K. Experiments with a <b>mixed</b> <b>feed</b> of hydrogen and methanol confirmed that methanol in the feed {{had a significant impact on}} hydrogen permeation as the membrane surface was contaminated and partly covered by a carbonaceous deposit produced from the decomposition of methanol even at a very low concentration of 1 % methanol in the <b>mixed</b> <b>feed.</b> On the other hand, if steam was present in the <b>mixed</b> <b>feed</b> the membrane performance could be maintained by oxidation of the carbonaceous deposit into CO or CO 2...|$|R
30|$|A {{substrate}} {{and water}} interaction affected plant SPAD readings at 25 DAP (Table  5). Fertigating tomato plants grown in substrates with 0  % AE improved SPAD readings 21.6  % compared to plants {{grown in the}} same substrate with municipal water. The <b>commercial</b> <b>mix</b> alone did not contain enough nutrients to sustain plant growth. Fertigating plants in 5  % AE slightly decreased SPAD readings 3.7  % compared to plants grown in the same substrate with municipal water.
