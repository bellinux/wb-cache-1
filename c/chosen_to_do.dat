5|$|In {{the rules}} of baseball, aside from the rare case of {{interference}} or obstruction, a batter who puts a ball into play and safely reaches first base is ruled to have reached {{in one of three}} possible ways: a hit, an error, or by fielder's choice. Fielder's choice is primarily discussed in rules 10.05 and 10.06, and it generally occurs when it is judged that a batter-runner would have been put out had the defense <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|E

Husband and wife team Wong Aksan and Titi Sjuman were <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the scoring, which they spent {{a month and a}} half on; they later said that work on the film brought them closer together. Shanty Harmayn, who had previously worked on Pasir Berbisik (Whispering Sands; 2004), was chosen to produce, while Salman Aristo, known for his scripts for Ayat-Ayat Cinta (Verses of Love; 2008) and Laskar Pelangi (Rainbow Warriors; 2009) spearheaded the writing. The screenplay went through twelve drafts and took two years of research.|$|E
5|$|Jackson {{became the}} first female pop singer to perform at the I. M. Pei glass pyramid at the Louvre Museum, raising {{contributions}} {{for the restoration of}} iconic artwork. Jackson was selected to endorse fashion line Blackglama for a second year, being the first celebrity in the line's history <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. She partnered with the label to release a fifteen-piece collection of luxury products. In 2012, Jackson endorsed Nutrisystem, sponsoring their weight-loss program after struggling with weight fluctuations in the past. With the program, she donated ten million dollars in meals to the hungry. She was honored by amfAR for her contributions to AIDS research when chairing the Cinema Against AIDS gala during the Cannes Film Festival. She also participated in a public service announcement for UNICEF to help starving children. In February 2013, Jackson announced she was married to her third husband, Qatari businessman Wissam Al Mana, during a private ceremony the previous year.|$|E

5|$|When {{taking an}} audition, a judge evaluates the idol over a 30-second period. The judge's {{interest}} level continuously decreases in 10% increments, but {{this can be}} increased with another minigame. The heart points obtained up to the audition {{are used in the}} minigame as the number of times the player is given to successfully appeal to the judge until all the points are exhausted. For instance, three heart points indicates the player will have three chances to increase a judge's interest level. At the end of the audition, a judge's interest level determines if the idol passes or not. If an idol passes the audition, he or she is <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a televised performance of the song previously chosen. A performance serves to increase an idol's number of fans, which in turn can increase an idol's rank if enough fans have been obtained for a given rank. For example, an idol starts at rank F with below 10,000 fans, and the next level up is a rank E with between 10,001 and 99,999 fans. The ranks continue from D to C, B, A and finally S.|$|E
25|$|Later in {{the same}} decade, the Titles Deprivation Act 1917 was passed. Some British peers had fought against the British in World War I; the act {{permitted}} the suspension of their titles. In 1919, three peers—Prince Charles Edward, Duke of Albany, Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland and Henry Taaffe, 12th Viscount Taaffe—had their peerage dignities suspended. The successors to those dignities may petition for their restoration, but none has <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|E
25|$|The {{election}} of Ethiopia's 547-member constituent assembly {{was held in}} June 1994. This assembly adopted {{the constitution of the}} Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia in December 1994. The elections for Ethiopia's first popularly chosen national parliament and regional legislatures were held in May and June 1995. Most opposition parties chose to boycott these elections. There was a landslide victory for the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). International and non-governmental observers concluded that opposition parties {{would have been able to}} participate had they <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|E

There it reunites with the Middle course and having crossed Valparola Pass follows the same road through San Ćiascian and La Ila to the finish line in Corvara.|$|E
25|$|McMahon greatly {{expanded}} {{the use of}} arbitration in securities disputes, since many of them take place under the 1934 Act, which regulates the secondary market in which most investors trade. It also signaled a greater acceptance of arbitration as a desirable and fair method of dispute resolution. This was cited by the Court three years later in Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express Inc., when it overturned Wilko completely and held that claims under the 1933 Act could also be arbitrated if the parties had clearly <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. The expansion in securities arbitration as a result led to reforms during the 1990s to make the process more investor-friendly.|$|E

25|$|The final {{identity}} perspective Gee identifies is the “affinity perspective (or A-identities)” (p.105). A-identities {{are built}} by shared experiences {{as part of}} an affinity group, which according to Gee’s definition is a group that share “allegiance to, access to, and participation in specific practices” (p.105). Joining these groups must be something the person has <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and feels a part of in order for the A-identity to be built. Gee explains this further by stating, “While I could force someone to engage in specific practices, I really cannot coerce anyone into seeing the particular experiences connected to those practices as constitutive (in part) of the ‘kind of person’ they are” (p.106).|$|E

500|$|As the Patriots {{tried to}} put {{themselves}} in position for a field goal, Arledge informed Frank Gifford and Howard Cosell of the shooting and suggested that they {{be the ones to}} report on the murder. Cosell, who had interviewed Lennon during a Monday Night Football broadcast in 1974, was <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so but was apprehensive of it at first, as he felt the game should take precedence and that it was not their place to break such a big story.

500|$|At {{the same}} time, Henry and his {{descendants}} normally followed {{the will of}} the courts, despite the fact they were theoretically not bound by judges.

Director Sam Mendes described Bond as experiencing a [...] "combination of lassitude, boredom, depression [...] difficulty with what he's <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> for a living".

They're really hunted by their fans much more. I remember driving around these remote towns in Wales and kids running after us in the street. I was like, 'This is horrible!' And I saw the effect it had on him, and that's when I decided I never wanted to be a celebrity at that level, and I think that's why I've <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the work that I do and just kind of work with directors that I love and try and do work that means something to me." ...|$|E
500|$|At this point, Alcibiades's scheme {{encountered}} a great obstacle. Tissaphernes {{would not make}} an agreement on any terms, wanting to follow his policy of neutrality.
