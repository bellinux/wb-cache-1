40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{an important}} problem in improvement of  braking dynamics potential {{as part of}} the overall tractor train dynamics consisting of   an all-wheel drive tractor and heavy-duty trailers which are either locally manufactured or developed with the participation of the paper’s authors. The trailers have a mechanical drive for their wheels from the tractor engine. The trains are intended for transportation peat, organic fertilizers and various loads in  forest exploitation and under other complicated soil and climatic and road conditions where there is justified necessity to activate the trailer wheels. Methodological tools have been developed with the purpose to analyze an influence of the blocked inter-double-reduction axle drive of an active tractor train on distribution of braking forces in double-reduction axles with due account of the heavy-duty peat trailer specificity. Theoretical provisions for wheeled vehicles have been developed with regard to the braking application specificity of active tractor trains with mechanical multi-path drive for wheels of a multi-double-reduction axle propulsion device. The paper presents calculation and theoretical data in order to estimate  distribution of specific braking forces in the double-reduction axle links of the active tractor train when the blocked inter-double-reduction axle drive of the tractor and trailer wheels is switched on and also in the case when the tractor engine is involved in braking process and a <b>clutch</b> <b>coupling</b> is switched-on. Sequence of the calculation formula has been completely carried out in the paper. They represent clear design and operational parameters of the active tractor train. Such approach has made it possible to realize them {{in the form of a}} software application which is convenient for analysis of the braking process pertaining to the investigated objects in order to select means for improvement of braking dynamics, rational parameters of multi-path wheel drive and tire completing of the active tractor train under design. The proposed information has a theoretical and practical value for specialists who are involved in development of new machine-tractor units for transport application in peat extraction, forestry, and agriculture. </p...|$|E

5000|$|For the 1968 model year, the Volkswagen Beetle {{offered an}} {{optional}} transmission marketed as Automatic Stickshift which {{was essentially a}} three-speed manual without a clutch pedal. Application of the driver's hand to gearshift knob caused the clutch to disengage via a 12 volt solenoid operating the vacuum clutch, thereby allowing shifting between gears. Once the driver's hand was removed, the clutch would re-engage automatically. The transmission was also equipped with a torque converter, allowing the car to idle in gear, like an automatic. The torque converter was operated by transmission fluid. This would allow the car to stop in any gear and start from a standing stop in any gear. This transmission was first available on the 1967 Volkswagen Beetle, and was made available on the Karmann Ghia in 1967. VW dropped the transmission option altogether in 1976. Some older (early 1960s) VW's sold in Europe had a [...] "Saxomat" [...] system which used a centrifigal <b>clutch</b> <b>coupled</b> to a standard 4-speed transmission.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the results of}} a project funded by Regione Toscana aimed at {{reducing}} the power absorption of auxiliary devices in vehicles are presented. In particular the design, testing and application of a magnetorheological clutch (MR) is proposed, aimed at disengaging the vacuum pump, which draws in air from the power-brake booster chamber, {{in order to reduce the}} device power absorption. Several clutch preliminary studies done to choose the clutch geometry and the magnetic field supply are illustrated. The final choice consisted in an MR clutch with permanent magnet, which satisfied size, torque and fail-safe specifications. The clutch characteristics, in terms of torque versus slip, were obtained experimentally for three different clutch prototypes on an ad-hoc developed test bench. As result of a preliminary simulation, a comparison between the power absorption of a current production vacuum pump, an innovative vacuum pump and both vacuum pumps coupled with the MR clutch is presented. The New European Driving Cycle is considered for simulating the vacuum pump operation both in urban and highway driving. Results show that the use of the innovative vacuum pump reduces the device consumption of about 35 %, whereas the use of MR <b>clutch</b> <b>coupled</b> with the innovative vacuum pump reduces it up to about 44 % in urban driving and 50 % in highway driving...|$|R

50|$|In motor vehicles, the {{transmission}} generally {{is connected to}} the engine crankshaft via a flywheel or <b>clutch</b> or fluid <b>coupling,</b> partly because internal combustion engines cannot run below a particular speed. The output of {{the transmission}} is transmitted via the driveshaft to one or more differentials, which drives the wheels. While a differential may also provide gear reduction, its primary purpose is to permit the wheels at either end of an axle to rotate at different speeds (essential to avoid wheel slippage on turns) as it changes the direction of rotation.|$|R
25|$|The {{two most}} common {{factory-installed}} locking differentials use either a computer-controlled multi-plate <b>clutch</b> or viscous <b>coupling</b> unit {{to join the}} shafts, while other differentials more commonly used on off-road vehicles generally use manually operated locking devices. In the multi-plate clutch the vehicle's computer senses slippage and locks the shafts, causing a small jolt when it activates, which can disturb the driver or cause additional traction loss. In the viscous coupling differentials the shear stress of high shaft speed differences causes a dilatant fluid in the differential to become solid, linking the two shafts. This design suffers from fluid degradation with age and from exponential locking behavior. Some designs use gearing to create a small rotational difference that hastens torque transfer.|$|R

50|$|A notable feature {{available}} in this generation was the automatic {{four wheel drive}} option called Quadra-Drive, which employed the New Venture Gear NV247 transfer case. This two-speed chain-driven transfer case uses a gerotor, a <b>clutch</b> pack <b>coupled</b> to a hydraulic pump, to transfer torque between {{the front and rear}} axles. The transfer case contains three modes, 4-All Time, Neutral, and 4-Lo. In 4-All Time, 100% of torque is sent to the rear axle in normal conditions. If the rear axle starts spinning at a higher rate than the front axle, hydraulic pressure builds up in the gerotor and causes the clutch pack to progressively transfer torque to the front axle until both axles return to the same speed. Neutral mode is intended for towing the vehicle. In 4-Lo, the front and rear axles are locked together through a 2.72 reduction gear ratio. The NV247 transfer case is mated to front and rear axles containing Jeep's Vari-Lok differentials. Vari-Lok differentials also use a gerotor to transfer torque between the wheels {{on either side of the}} axle. The major advantage of Quadra-Drive was that the combined transfer case and progressive locking differentials in each axle could automatically control traction between all four wheels. However, only the center differential could be permanently locked, and only in 4Lo. The Quadra-Trac II system included the NV247 transfer case with the standard open front and rear differentials.|$|R

5000|$|The Ducks {{headed into}} the ’63 Sun Bowl without injured all-American halfback and {{defensive}} back Mel Renfro. They needed H.D.

The former junior college transfer made two <b>clutch</b> interceptions, <b>coupled</b> with Dennis Keller's touchdown run {{in the first quarter}} and Bob Berry throwing two touchdown passes in the second quarter to give Oregon a 21-0 lead at halftime. One of those interceptions came at Oregon’s own three-yard line to thwart a potential scoring drive for the Mustangs, and the other Murphy returned 49 yards to set up the Ducks’ first touchdown. Murphy’s outstanding defensive play greatly contributed to the team’s lead in the first half. It was up to Danny Thomas and Mac White to try to bring SMU back, and they narrowed the lead to 21-14 as each threw a touchdown pass to John Roderick in the fourth quarter. SMU's onside kick with less than a minute remaining went out of bounds, giving the Webfoots the ball and ultimately the win. Oregon won their first bowl game since the 1917 Rose Bowl. It would be their last bowl win until the 1989 Independence Bowl. Bob Berry went 11-of-26, but threw for 146 yards with two touchdowns and one interception and was named MVP. Conversely, Danny Thomas threw 15-of-26 for 188 yards for one touchdown and two interceptions for the Mustangs. Oregons Defense (Due to H.D.

40|$|A RANCOR drill was {{designed}} to fit a Mars Exploration Rover (MER) class vehicle. The low mass of 3 kg was achieved by using the same actuator for three functions: rotation, percussions, and core break-off. Initial testing of the drill exposed an unexpected behavior of an off-the-shelf sprag <b>clutch</b> used to <b>couple</b> and decouple rotary-percussive function from the core break off function. Failure of the sprag {{was due to the}} vibration induced during percussive drilling. The sprag clutch would back drive in conditions where it was expected to hold position. Although this did not affect the performance of the drill, it nevertheless reduced the quality of the cores produced. Ultimately, the sprag clutch was replaced with a custom ratchet system that allowed for some angular displacement without advancing in either direction. Replacing the sprag with the ratchet improved the collected core quality. Also, premature failure of a 300 -series stainless steel percussion spring was observed. The 300 -series percussion spring was ultimately replaced with a music wire spring based on performances of previously designed rotary-percussive drill systems...|$|R
