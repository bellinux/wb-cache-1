This study was carried out in two pistachio orchards of Rafsanjan area. Periods of pupal cocoon and adult emergence were recorded in two pistachio orchards for four years. <b>Minimum</b> <b>threshold</b> temperatures were calculated according to the least coefficient of variation method for different developmental stages. Cumulative effective temperatures were calculated for different percentages of pupal cocoon and adult emergence. Results showed that <b>minimum</b> <b>threshold</b> temperatures for overwintering larvae to pupal cocoon formation, Larvae to adult and pupal cocoon to adult were calculated 10 ْ C, 11 ْ C and 12 ْ C, respectively. Cumulative effective temperatures for occurrence of 50 % pupal cocoon from overwintering larvae with <b>minimum</b> <b>threshold</b> temperatures 10 ْ C under field conditions were 73. 6 degree-day.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the idea is}} to {{rationale}} a new active queue management technique (MGF-RED) based on Random Early Detection (RED), a well known active queue management technique for congestion avoidance. The conventional RED uses the concept of <b>minimum</b> <b>threshold,</b> maximum threshold and average queue length. If the average queue length increases by <b>minimum</b> <b>threshold</b> then the algorithm start dropping the packets with some probability using linear function of average queue size. If the average queue size is greater than the maximum threshold then packets are dropped with 1 probability. The proposed algorithm will use Modified Gaussian function for calculating the likelihood of packet drop as the average queue length increases the <b>minimum</b> <b>threshold.</b> Simulation has been performed using NS- 2. 34. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm will present better network performance in throughput, packet delivery fraction and number of dropped packets...|$|R

50|$|Chemical {{herbicides}} {{that have}} been used with the best success on <b>S.</b> <b>minima</b> include the ingredients fluridone, imazamox, and penoxsulam.

Though herbicides are effective in controlling <b>S.</b> <b>minima,</b> they can have adverse effects. Herbicides can kill or cause harm to native organisms that are not the intended target. Also, if a large area of <b>S.</b> <b>minima</b> is sprayed with an herbicide all at once, the dead plant matter will sink into the water and decompose, which can deplete oxygen in the water and result in fish kills. Smaller sections can be sprayed at a time to combat this side effect.|$|R
50|$|Since the {{discovery}} of the weevils, research has been conducted on the effects of weevils in different habitats of <b>S.</b> <b>minima.</b> In 2005-2006, a research group from Louisiana State University (LSU) introduced salvinia weevils into Gramercy, LA, where <b>S.</b> <b>minima</b> is present. The salvinia weevils were collected from Florida and kept in greenhouses on the LSU campus in Baton Rouge. In the study, the effects of the weevils on <b>S.</b> <b>minima</b> were compared to the effects of the salvinia stem-borer moth, Samea multiplicalis. The stem-borer moth is a species native to the southern United States and is known to feed on other salvinia species in the same genus. Both the moth and the weevil feed on salvinia plants and control its spread. The study had four treatments: the weevil alone, the moth larvae alone, the weevil and moth larvae combined, and a control group. Each group was placed in a 1-m2 poyvinylchloride (PVC) pipe frame that was placed over a section of <b>S.</b> <b>minima</b> in a waterway in Gramercy. There were four replicates of each treatment. Each month during the research, <b>S.</b> <b>minima</b> plant mass was collected from each treatment square and then measured to find the dry weight of the plant. Data were compiled into bar charts to compare the effects of the four treatments over time. The results of this study found that the three treatments all had a significant effect in decreasing the amount of <b>S.</b> <b>minima</b> in an area when compared to the control group, though none of the three experimental treatments were statistically better than the other two. From June to October 2006, the average biomass of <b>S.</b> <b>minima</b> in the treatment groups was 100-375 grams, whereas the average biomass of <b>S.</b> <b>minima</b> in the control frames was 450-600 grams. The salvinia stem-borer moth is native to the United States and presents no threat to the environment. There are also no known negative impacts of introducing the non-indigenous salvinia weevils to the environment, as they feed exclusively on <b>S.</b> <b>minima</b> and <b>S.</b> molesta.|$|R
