Conventional thinking had to be challenged, for example, rather than a conventional automobile seat which would weigh tens of pounds, Maize & Blue employed a nylon mesh seat combined with a five-point harness that weighed less than 3 pounds.|$|E

Once the testimonials, reviews and/or results are verified, the company can include them in their profiles and add a 'trust mark' similar to that of Verisign, the Better Business Bureau, or Good Housekeeping. The presence of this seal or trust mark helps consumers determine how much weight they should give to the testimonials they are reading before making a decision to support a business.|$|E
50|$|Gleed Girls' Technology College was a {{secondary}} school on Neville Avenue in Spalding, Lincolnshire, England. It opened on 28 April 1941 as Spalding The Gleed Senior Council School and comprised boys' and girls departments which from 1946 {{were regarded as}} separate schools under the same management. From October 1946 to 1948 the two schools were known as Spalding Gleed Secondary Modern Schools. From October 1948 until at least 1974 they were again regarded as separate departments of the school which was known as Spalding Gleed County Secondary School. It became a Specialist Technology College in 2001. From September 2009 it was a <b>combined</b> <b>Technology</b> and Applied Learning Specialist College.

50|$|The {{combination}} {{concept of}} ATES and enhanced natural attenuation (ATES-ENA) {{can possibly be}} used in the Netherlands and China, especially in urbanized areas. These areas in both countries are confronted with organic groundwater contaminations. Currently, the combination concept may be better applicable for the Netherlands with more mature technology and application of ATES. And the overlapping between ATES and groundwater contamination also promotes the need of this <b>combined</b> <b>technology.</b> However, for China where ATES is much less developed compared to the Netherlands, the important advantages are that many more demonstration pilot projects can be set-up prior to real applications, and flexible systems can be developed because of the less intense pressure on subsurface use by ATES compared to the Netherlands. For sustainable urban development, the combined ATES-ENA technology can provide contributions to the solution of both energy and environmental problems.|$|E
