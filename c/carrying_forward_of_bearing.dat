40|$|Section 20 of the Income Tax Act, No 58 of 1962 {{allows a}} {{taxpayer}} that incurs an assessed loss to <b>carry</b> <b>forward</b> the balance <b>of</b> assessed loss incurred, {{to be set}} off against taxable income earned in or added to losses incurred in future years. The issues regarding the <b>carry</b> <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> assessed losses in terms of section 20 is complex {{and in terms of}} the said section, a company is only entitled to set off its assessed loss from the previous year against its taxable income in the current year, if the taxpayer has carried on a trade during the current year and has derived income from that trade. Under the provisions of section 20 (2 A), a taxpayer other than a company can utilise an assessed loss even if no trading has been conducted. Assessed losses of natural persons, may however be ring-fenced. The aim of this treatise was twofold. Firstly it was to gain clarity on the „trade‟ and „income from trade‟ issues and secondly to compare South African legislation with that of Australia, with a view to recommending a change in our rules regarding the treatment of assessed losses in the context of companies. The critical lessons to be learned from the cases presented, is that liquidators, creditors and others must ensure that the company continues trading in order to x keep the assessed losses valid. Realisation of assets (including stock), and the collection of outstanding debts during liquidation does not constitute the carrying on of a trade in terms of s 20 (1). The continuity of trade is an important element in regard to the <b>carry</b> <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> assessed losses to be utilised in the current and future years. Therefore it is important that a company carries on some activity that falls within the definition of trade. In the landmark case of SA Bazaars, it was held that a company did not have to trade continuously throughout the year to qualify for the set-off of the assessed loss or <b>carry</b> <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> the assessed loss, that is, to trade for say part of the year. The court however left open the issue of whether it was necessary to derive income from that trade. In order to clarify the issues regarding assessed losses, SARS issued Interpretation Note 33 granting taxpayers a concession in certain cases where a company has traded, but not derived income from that trade. But in ITC 1830, the court ruled that a company must trade and must derive income from that trade in order to <b>carry</b> <b>forward</b> its assessed loss, which effectively means that SARS cannot apply Interpretation Note 33. SARS does not have the authority to make concession which is contrary to the wording of the Act. xi In Australia, operating losses can be <b>carried</b> <b>forward</b> indefinitely to be set-off against future income, provided a company meets the more than 50 % continuity of ownership test. Where the continuity test fails, losses can be deducted if the same business is carried on in the income year (the same business test). From the research conducted and in order to solve the issues surrounding the <b>carry</b> <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> assessed losses it was suggested that one of the following be adopted :- The method used in Australia for the <b>carry</b> <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> assessed losses., or A decision of the Supreme Court of Appeal is needed for a departure from the literal meaning of the words pertaining to the requirements regarding the <b>carry</b> <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> assessed losses. Furthermore, to clarify the definition of „income‟, as used in the context of s 20, is it gross income less exempt income or taxable income?. If section 20 relates to taxable income, then an assessed loss will never be increased, which it is submitted, is not what the legislature intended. Section 20 ought to be revisited to eliminate any uncertainty about the income requirement and in the context in which the word „income‟ is used in that section...|$|R
