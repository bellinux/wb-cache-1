The explicit motion of particles for which the quadratic approximation to the Hamiltonian {{was carried out in}} some previous publications is now presented.

40|$|Godel {{universe}} in M-theory is a supersymmetric and homogeneous background with rotation and four-form magnetic flux. It is known that, {{as seen in}} inertial frame of co-moving observer, all geodesics with zero orbital angular momentum orbit inside `surface of light velocity' (CTC horizon). To learn if other probes can travel beyond the CTC horizon, we study dynamics of M-graviton and, in particular, M 2 -brane, whose motion is affected by Lorentz force exerted by the four-form magnetic flux and by nonzero orbital angular momentum. Classically, we find that both probes gyrate closed orbits, but diameter and <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>gyration</b> depends on sign and magnitude of probe's energy, charge and orbital angular momentum. For M 2 -brane, orbits in general travel outside the CTC horizon. Quantum-mechanically, we find that wave function and excitation energy levels are all self-similar.

40|$|We report {{experimental}} and analytical work on spin-transfer torque induced vortex dynamics in metallic nanopillars with in-plane magnetized layers. We study nanopillars with {{a diameter of}} 150 nm, containing two Fe layers with a thickness of 15 nm and 30 nm respectively, separated by a 6 nm Ag spacer. The sample geometry is such that it allows {{for the formation of}} magnetic vortices in the Fe disks. As confirmed by micromagnetic simulations, we are able to prepare states where one magnetic layer is homogeneously magnetized while the other contains a vortex. We experimentally show that in this configuration spin-transfer torque can excite vortex dynamics and analyze their dependence on a magnetic field applied in the sample plane. The <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>gyration</b> is continuously dislocated from the disk center, and the potential changes its shape with field strength. The latter is reflected in the field dependence of the excitation frequency. In the second part we propose a novel mechanism for the excitation of the gyrotropic mode in nanopillars with a perfectly homogeneously magnetized in-plane polarizing layer. We analytically show that in this configuration the vortex can absorb energy from the spin-polarized electric current if the angular spin-transfer efficiency function is asymmetric. This effect is supported by micromagnetic simulations. Comment: The article has been sent to J. Phys. D. Submitted on August 9, 2010. (7 pages and 4 figures. ...|$|E
30|$|A {{schematic}} sketch {{is shown}} in panel 1 (a): the exobase, {{the inner and outer}} spheres, a grid cell and some ion gyrations. The distance between the inner shell and the exobase is negligible, 36 km, and then the precipitation patterns will be qualitatively the same for one set of inputs. The distance between the inner and outer spheres is 324 km, which is twice the grid size (180 km, at r < 2 Rm). The grid size is thus fine enough to capture the behaviour of the precipitating particles as they go from the outer sphere down to the exobase. An ion with energy 2 keV in a 20 nT magnetic field has a gyroradius of ~ 324 km. Hence, in this case, the distance between the shells is 1 gyroradius ~ 2 grid cells. The ion H+ 1 has the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>gyration</b> above the outer sphere and impacts it several times. The ion H+ 2 can hit the outer and inner spheres one time. The ion H+ 3 hits the inner boundary one time and is absorbed. When an ion hits the inner sphere, it has practically reached the exobase, as one can see on the figure. An ion with a small gyroradius under the same magnetic field (lower energy) can gyrate during a longer time from the outer sphere to the exobase before it is taken away. In the same manner, if the magnetic field increases, the ion gyroradius becomes smaller and the particle hits the spheres more times while gyrating. On the other hand, particles with a small gyroradius tend to be backscattered at high altitude by the magnetic field. It means that the height of the depletion layer (height from which the ions have no room to gyrate because they are taken away) depends on the particle energy and on the magnetic field. In reality, the ions are not immediately lost, but scattered back by the atmosphere after ion-neutral collisions (see Kallio and Barabash, 2001, their figure 2).|$|E
