40|$|A Dissertation {{submitted}} to the Department of Management of Technology for the MBAThe International Direct Dialing (IDD) is considering {{as one of the}} most profitable area in telecommunication industry. Initially the IDD service offered only for the key customers. Once more operators allow providing the IDD service it was opened for all the customers. Once it opens for all the customer's telecommunication operators start to operate the prepaid IDD <b>call</b> <b>card</b> service. Presently the prepaid IDD <b>call</b> <b>card</b> market is the one of the most competitive area in telecommunication industry in Sri Lanka. There are different types of prepaid IDD <b>call</b> <b>cards</b> entering in to market day by day. Also telecommunication operators as well as non-telecommunication operators operate these cards. There is a rapid growth in the customer base in this market segment. This research study mainly focused on the service quality in IDD prepaid <b>call</b> <b>card</b> market and the analysis of the customer behavior. Also it was required to identify the factors affected to the prepaid IDD <b>call</b> <b>card</b> market. The service quality was measured using well-known SERVQUAL model [...] There were four prepaid IDD <b>call</b> <b>cards</b> used for this research and details collected through questionnaire. The data analysis was done using SPSS software and EXCEL software. Several customer groups were identified based on their income, age and occupation. When considering the customer income group behavior it was identified that when the customer income increased then the charge satisfaction also increased. Further it reviled that when the customer income increase the satisfaction of user friendliness of the system decrease. The results were reveled that negative correlation exists between customer income and the sender quality. The satisfaction of the service quality decreased when the customer's age increased. There is a strong positive correlation between the service quality and the user friendliness of the customer helpdesk. Also there is a positive correlation exists between the service quality and the average usage, feature satisfaction, years of use, charge satisfaction. When considering the prepaid IDD <b>calls</b> <b>card</b> market there is 76. 8 % of the customers satisfied about the present service quality. Finally results from this research work suggest that what type ofchangcs require enhancing the prepaid IDD <b>call</b> <b>card</b> service...|$|R
40|$|Identifying genomic {{targets of}} {{transcription}} factors is fundamental for understanding transcriptional regulatory networks. Current technology enables identification of all targets {{of a single}} transcription factor, {{but there is no}} realistic way to achieve the converse: identification of all proteins that bind to a promoter of interest. We have developed a method that promises to fill this void. It employs the yeast retrotransposon Ty 5, whose integrase interacts with the Sir 4 protein. A DNA-binding protein fused to Sir 4 directs insertion of Ty 5 into the genome near where it binds; the Ty 5 becomes a “calling card” the DNA-binding protein leaves behind in the genome. We constructed customized <b>calling</b> <b>cards</b> for seven transcription factors of yeast by including in each Ty 5 a unique DNA sequence that serves as a “molecular bar code. ” Ty 5 transposition was induced in a population of yeast cells, each expressing a different transcription factor–Sir 4 fusion and its matched, bar-coded Ty 5, and the <b>calling</b> <b>cards</b> deposited into selected regions of the genome were identified, revealing the transcription factors that visited that region of the genome. In each region we analyzed, we found <b>calling</b> <b>cards</b> for only the proteins known to bind there: In the GAL 1 – 10 promoter we found only <b>calling</b> <b>cards</b> for Gal 4; in the HIS 4 promoter we found only Gcn 4 calling cards; in the PHO 5 promoter we found only Pho 4 and Pho 2 <b>calling</b> <b>cards.</b> We discuss how Ty 5 <b>calling</b> <b>cards</b> might be implemented for mapping all targets of all transcription factors in a single experiment...|$|R
5|$|Digital: A Love Story is {{a visual}} novel, or {{interactive}} fiction game, where the game's {{story is told}} primarily through text. The game is presented {{as if on a}} computer from the late 1980s running the Amie operating system (the name and visual appearance a reference to 1.x versions of AmigaOS). The player logs into bulletin board systems, or BBSs, where they read and reply to messages from other people. Messages received from other characters in the game are displayed through a different program on the computer screen. Accessing a BBS requires the knowledge of the telephone number for that board, which the player must type in manually. Boards that require a long-distance telephone number to reach require the player to use illegally obtained long-distance <b>calling</b> <b>card</b> numbers found online. Accessing boards also requires the player to either set up a user account for that board or to know the password necessary to enter the system.|$|E
5|$|Shyamalan and cinematographer Eduardo Serra chose several {{camera angles}} to {{simulate}} {{the look of a}} comic book panel. Various visual narrative motifs were also applied. Several scenes relating to the Mr. Glass character involve glass. As a newborn, he is primarily seen reflected in mirrors, and as a young child, he is seen reflected in a blank TV screen. When he leaves his <b>calling</b> <b>card</b> on the windshield of David Dunn's car, he is reflected in a glass frame in his art gallery. Jackson requested his walking stick be made of glass to make his character more menacing. Using purple as Mr. Glass' color to David Dunn's green was also Jackson's idea. Mr. Glass' wig was modeled after Afro-American statesman Frederick Douglass. As he does in his other films, Shyamalan makes a cameo appearance. He plays a man David suspects of dealing drugs inside the stadium.|$|E
