40|$|Key {{findings}} and perspectives from a relapse study of correctional {{clients in the}} Nordic countries are presented and discussed. The findings are {{based on data from}} national computer registers of correctional offenders. Methodologically, a common definition of reoffending, a common observation period and a shared classification of offender groups are applied. Selected national differences are pointed out and discussed. In the article it is argued that the overall national differences in reoffending rates mainly reflect the national differences in the criminal sanction systems, such as the distribution and the proportion of principal <b>crime</b> <b>type</b> groups serving in prison compared to those serving community sanctions, and differences in risk of committing new offences. The latter is clearly reflected by the different percentages of previous prison sentences among different offender groups in prison and probation. Except for traffic offences, in total, all <b>crime</b> <b>type</b> groups reoffended more often to a different primary <b>crime</b> <b>type</b> than the original offence. This strongly indicates that most reoffenders seem to have comprehensive crime problems that have to be addressed.

40|$|Offender {{behaviour}} is used {{to distinguish}} between crimes committed by the same person (linked crimes) and crimes committed by different people (unlinked crimes) through behavioural case linkage. There is growing {{evidence to support the}} use of behavioural case linkage by investigative organisations such as the police, but this research is typically limited to samples of solved crime that do not reflect how this procedure is used in real life. The current paper extends previous research by testing the potential for behavioural case linkage in a sample containing both solved and unsolved crimes. Discrimination accuracy is examined across crime categories (e. g. a crime pair containing a car theft and a residential burglary), across <b>crime</b> <b>types</b> (e. g. a crime pair containing a residential burglary and a commercial burglary), and within <b>crime</b> <b>types</b> (e. g. a crime pair containing two residential burglaries) using the number of kilometres (intercrime distance) and the number of days (temporal proximity) between offences to distinguish between linked and unlinked crimes. The intercrime distance and/or the temporal proximity were able to achieve statistically significant levels of discrimination accuracy across crime categories, across <b>crime</b> <b>types,</b> and within <b>crime</b> <b>types</b> as measured by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. This suggests that behavioural case linkage can be used to assist the investigation, detection and prosecution of prolific and versatile serial offenders. 11797...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{attempts to}} uncover the causal relationship between alcohol abuse and both income growth and crime. These two research questions are investigated in three essays: Essay I investigates the relationship between alcohol abuse and income growth in the United States; Essay II examines the impact of alcohol abuse on income growth at the international level; Essay III investigates the effect of alcohol abuse on crime in the united states. 	Essay I of this dissertation uses state level data from the United States for the period 1970 - 1998 to estimate the impact of alcohol abuse on income growth by utilizing per capita beer consumption as the measure of alcohol abuse. Results suggest that, even though generally small, there is a negative relationship between alcohol abuse and income growth once the endogeneity between income growth and per capita beer consumption is addressed by utilizing levels of excise alcohol taxes and the Minimum Drinking Age Law of 21 as instruments. These results indirectly favor the previous research on two dimensions: First, alcohol abuse generates a significant burden on the economy; Second, increases in excise alcohol taxes would be efficient in terms of income growth. 	Essay II of this dissertation uses data from 72 countries for the period 1960 - 1995 to estimate the impact of alcohol abuse on income growth by utilizing per capita beer, wine, liquor, and total ethanol consumption as the measures of alcohol abuse. Results suggest that, even though generally small, there is a negative significant relationship between per capita beer consumption and income growth once the endogeneity between income growth and per capita beer consumption is addressed with system GMM dynamic panel estimators. These results show that per capita beer consumption is the medium of alcohol abuse {{not only in the}} United States, but also around the world. Moreover, these results favor the previous research on the fact that alcohol abuse generates a significant burden on economies. 	Essay III of this dissertation uses state level data from the United States for the period 1982 - 2000 to investigate the relationship between crime and alcohol abuse by utilizing per capita beer consumption as the measure of alcohol abuse. Potential endogeneity between per capita beer consumption and crime is addressed by using excise beer taxes and alcohol control measures as instruments. Results show that alcohol abuse seems to have a positive impact overall on the crime rate. Nevertheless, the effect is not uniform among different <b>crime</b> <b>types.</b> In the case of property <b>crime</b> <b>types,</b> results suggest that alcohol abuse plays a more important role in <b>crime</b> <b>types</b> that require a lesser degree of organization and more spontaneity (i. e., larceny theft versus burglary and motor vehicle theft). In the case of violent <b>crime</b> <b>types,</b> results suggest that the impact of alcohol abuse is more pressing in non-murder <b>crime</b> <b>types</b> versus murder. These results have policy implications: excise alcohol taxes and alcohol control policies {{may play a role in}} reducing certain <b>crime</b> <b>types,</b> which are larceny theft, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault, but not the other <b>crime</b> <b>types,</b> which are burglary, motor vehicle theft, and murder...|$|R

40|$|We {{view the}} {{locations}} {{and times of}} a collection of crime events as a space-time point pattern. So, with either a nonhomogeneous Poisson process or with a more general Cox process, we need to specify a space-time intensity. For the latter, we need a random intensity which we model as a realization of a spatio-temporal log Gaussian process. Importantly, we view time as circular not linear, necessitating valid separable and nonseparable covariance functions over a bounded spatial region crossed with circular time. In addition, crimes are classified by <b>crime</b> <b>type.</b> Furthermore, each crime event is recorded by day of the year which we convert to day of the week marks. The contribution here is to develop models to accommodate such data. Our specifications take the form of hierarchical models which we fit within a Bayesian framework.

The aim of this study was to assess social health and its related factors among male prisoners. Methods: This descriptive-analytic study was conducted on 200 male prisoners in the central prison of Urmia using simple random sampling method in 2016. The instruments included Keyes Social Health Questionnaire to measure social health and a demographic questionnaire containing demographic information on type of crime. The data analysis was performed using chi-square, one-way ANOVA and Scheffe tests in SPSS 16. Results: Mean score of social health of male prisoners was 65. 01 (10. 11) from the total score of 100.

The project, entitled City Centre Crime, was conducted by the Design Against Crime Solution Centre at the University of Salford, and initiated by the Manchester Crime & Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP). An area of Manchester’s city centre was identified by the CDRP as containing a significant number of crime ‘hot spots’. A holistic approach was employed by the Solution Centre in order to understand more fully the motivations and behaviour—both legitimate and illegitimate—of users of the built environment. Data was gathered from a range of sources, including police recorded crime data, details of modus operandi, geographical information analyses, qualitative interviews with public and private stakeholders, and observational research.
