40|$|We study a {{manufacturer}} that faces a supplier privileged with private information about supply disruptions. We investigate how risk-management {{strategies of the}} manufacturer change and examine whether risk-management tools {{are more or less}} valuable in the presence of such asymmetric information. We model a supply chain with one manufacturer and one supplier, in which the supplier's reliability is either high or low and is the supplier's private information. On disruption, the supplier chooses to either pay a penalty to the manufacturer for the shortfall or use backup production to fill the manufacturer's order. Using mechanism design theory, we derive the optimal contract menu offered by the manufacturer. We find that information asymmetry may cause the less reliable <b>supplier</b> <b>type</b> to stop using backup production while the more reliable <b>supplier</b> <b>type</b> continues to use it. Additionally, the manufacturer may stop ordering from the less reliable <b>supplier</b> <b>type</b> altogether. The value of supplier backup production for the manufacturer is not necessarily larger under symmetric information; for the more reliable <b>supplier</b> <b>type,</b> it could be negative. The manufacturer is willing to pay the most for information when supplier backup production is moderately expensive. The value of information may increase as <b>supplier</b> <b>types</b> become uniformly more reliable. Thus, higher reliability need not be a substitute for better information. supply risk, mechanism design, contract, nondelivery penalty...|$|R

40|$|This memo {{provides}} {{information for the}} Internet community. This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. Process: This document describes the process for creating new BGP attribute <b>type</b> <b>codes.</b> Basic attribute <b>type</b> <b>codes</b> are described in RFC 1771, pages 12 through 15. These, and new attribute <b>type</b> <b>codes</b> {{that are used in}} the Internet are registered with the IANA. The actual process will involve the documentation of such attribute <b>type</b> <b>codes</b> in an RFC. There is no intention of segmenting the code space into public/private or IP/OSI or any other sectioning. As each attribute <b>type</b> <b>code</b> {{is in the process of}} being developed, it will use an octet value of 255, which will be reserved for this use. At the time an attribute <b>type</b> <b>code</b> is assigned a number by the IANA, the documetnation and code base will be updated to reflect the authorized attribute <b>type</b> <b>code</b> value. IANA maintained values will be published in the periodically updated Assigned Numbers RFC [6]. Requests for assignment of a new attribute <b>type</b> <b>code</b> should be sent to the IANA (IANA@IANA. ORG) with a subject that includes the phrase "BGP Attribute Type".

40|$|Dynamic {{languages}} {{are becoming increasingly}} popular for different software development scenarios such as rapid prototyping because of the flexibility and agile interactive development they offer. The benefits of dynamic {{languages are}}, however, counteracted by many limitations produced {{by the lack of}} static typing. In order to obtain the benefits of both approaches, some programming languages offer a hybrid dynamic and static type system. The existing IDEs for these hybrid typing languages do not provide any type-based feature when dynamic typing is used, lacking important IDE facilities offered for statically <b>typed</b> <b>code.</b> We have implemented a constraint-based type inference system that gathers type information of dynamic references at compile time. Using this type information, we have extended a professional IDE to offer those type-based features missed for dynamically <b>typed</b> <b>code.</b> Following the Separation of Concerns principle, the IDE has also been customized to facilitate the conversion of dynamically <b>typed</b> <b>code</b> into statically <b>typed</b> one, and vice versa...|$|R
