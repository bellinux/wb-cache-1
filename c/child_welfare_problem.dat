40|$|Child {{abuse is}} {{commonly}} {{regarded as a}} <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>problem,</b> and {{a considerable amount of}} information has been amassed from this perspective. When a child is assaulted, however, it is not only a <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>problem,</b> it is a crime, and yet {{there is a lack of}} law enforcement data available for researchers to analyze. Use of the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), which collects detailed data about crime and its victims, should help fill this gap. This Bulletin describes NIBRS and its role in depicting police experience with child abuse and reports key findings derived from NIBRS data. Analysis of these data indicates that parents and other caretakers commit 49 percent of the kidnapings and 27 percent of the sexual assaults of juveniles. These and other caretaker offenses are reviewed in these pages. The Bulletin also offers an informative comparison of NIBRS and child welfare system data and discusses the policy implications arising from NIBRS data. To fully comprehend the harm that child abuse inflicts on children, policymakers need a clearer understanding of the role law enforcement plays— and could play—in addressing the problem of child maltreatment. The NIBRS data described in this Bulletin contribute to increasing that understanding and clarify law enforcement’s critical role...|$|E

40|$|Romania became notorious in {{the last}} decade of the 20 th century for <b>{{problems}}</b> in its <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> system. <b>Child</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>problems</b> and other social problems were exacerbated by the difficulties encountered in the transition to a market economy, including increased levels of poverty, unemployment, and child abandonment.

40|$|Given the {{seriousness}} of substance abuse as a <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>problem,</b> {{the purpose of this}} study was to examine the relative effectiveness of an inservice training curriculum for child welfare workers. The training was designed to improve worker knowledge and attitudes in working with substance abusing families. Seventy (70) child welfare workers from public and private agencies in two south Florida counties participated in a pretest/posttest control group design that also trained and retested the control group. ^ The literature review supports that the general preparedness of child welfare workers for the issues presented by substance abusing families is in question. Confounding this problem is a lack of understanding of substance abuse dynamics, worker biases, and predispositions. The two research hypotheses focused on whether inservice training could increase worker knowledge and improve worker attitudes in working with this population. Training delivery was in the form of a five-day inservice focusing on an array of substance abuse knowledge and attitudinal topics. Separate knowledge and attitude instruments were developed for the research and were administered, before and after training, to a purposive sample of participants that were randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups. ^ The data analysis supported the research hypotheses but raised a question. Specifically, the experimental group demonstrated significant improvement in posttest scores on both instruments after receiving the training; whereas the control group, with training withheld, also demonstrated a significant improvement at posttest, but only on the knowledge instrument. Although the question was unanswered, when examined at a more critical significance level, only the experimental group remained significant. The hypotheses were reconfirmed when, after training and retesting, the control group also displayed significant improvement on both instruments. ^ The findings support the conclusion that this substance abuse inservice was effective in improving worker knowledge and attitudes regarding working with substance abusing families. As an implication for social work practice, it suggests that similar inservice training can be a viable training resource when formal substance abuse training is unavailable. Additional research is suggested regarding to what degree increased substance abuse knowledge and improved worker attitudes correlate with improved practice. ...|$|E

40|$|Families {{who come}} to the {{attention}} of DCFS live in our communities. They are our neighbors, and sometimes, they are our family members. Some face untreated psychiatric disorders or substance abuse or suffer because of the poor quality of the treatment offered. In many cases, state and private <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> agencies cannot remedy <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>problems</b> without family-focused mental health and substance abuse interventions. The right diagnosis, matched with the right treatment and the supports of extended family, are critical components to the well-being of the DCFS involved family. The frequency of mothers suffering from post-partum depression, bi-polar and schizophrenia disorders, and the lack of substantive responses from our mental health systems reminds us that vulnerable moments for a parent may create vulnerable moments for children. With the right mental health interventions and the help of extended family, we as a community may be able to have better and safer outcomes for our parents and their children. Children with challenging medical health problems also require community response. Prevention funding for public health visits to support families caring for medically challenged children is more appropriate than child protection investigations when the problem is often a lack of communication among treating sub specialists or lack of respite support for struggling parents...|$|R
40|$|In {{supporting}} kinship {{care as a}} “new ” {{solution to}} old <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>problems,</b> we should acknowledge {{the history of the}} extended family and of informal kinship care in individual families. In this article, we review the role of extended family in the lives of 30 youth currently residing in kinship care households. We find that these youth have extensive experience living with kin prior to their formal place-ment in kinship care, and that these youth continue to rely on extended family networks after their official placement with kin. This familiarity with extended family households suggests that youth in kinship care may find these arrange-ments neither novel nor disruptive. We recommend that service providers and researchers working with kinship care understand the adaptable and flexible na-ture of the family and acknowledge that this flexibility often protects families fac-ing social and economic adversity. We further suggest that continued idealization of the nuclear family—including its use in the conceptualization of foster care— may hinder service provision because it obscures the resources of extended fami-lies...|$|R
40|$|This summer, {{following}} hearings by the House Committee on DCFS Oversight, {{several pieces}} of legislation were passed tackling current <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>problems.</b> Public Act 95 - 0405, which will be effective June 2008, allows child protection investigators and intact family caseworkers to request a Juvenile Court order of protection when a parent, guardian or custodian’s cooperation with critical services, such as substance abuse or mental health treatment, {{is necessary for the}} safety and <b>welfare</b> of a <b>child.</b> The use of graduated sanctions has been successful in drug courts throughout the state and is a welcome application to <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> cases.

40|$|The {{question}} of how social workers view <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>problems</b> and what are seen as appropriate interventions has been subject of debate and research the last decades. The aim {{of the study is}} to investigate how different <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> models influence social workers’ assessment of cases involving children at risk. This is done by identifying differences and similarities between Nordic and Italian social workers’ assessments regarding the levels of intervention, their line of reasoning and the types of intervention proposed. A recent comparative study of social workers’ assessment in four Nordic countries reveals a tendency to apply a common model in social work with children and families. The data for this study, collected through a qualitative vignette study involving 18 Italian social workers, are compared with the results of the Nordic study. The analysis displays certain differences between Italian and Nordic social workers’ assessments, in particular with adolescents, but also indicates similar approaches with babies and children. The similarities in the assessment of Nordic and Italian social workers, especially in the line of reasoning, indicate a common professional base of values and knowledge among social workers working with families. The study also shows that <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> models, as institutional factors, actually influence social workers’ assessment of cases involving children at risk, when it comes to level of intervention and intervention proposed. Such influence seems to be mediated by meso-level organisational factors related to how social work with children at risk is organised...|$|R

40|$|The present American <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> system infringes {{upon the}} {{fundamental}} liberty interests {{of millions of}} children and parents, is adversarial and punitive, and fails to prevent child maltreatment or protect children adequately from its most severe forms. Many in the field now recognize that a public health model would more effectively support the parent–child relationship and protect children from maltreatment than the current paradigm. Despite much attention to such an approach, the field has yet to develop a clear vision for how the law could or should support a public health approach or shape the actions of individuals and institutions best suited to lead a public health response. This Article {{is the first to}} identify the core legal reforms necessary to shape a public health approach to <b>child</b> <b>welfare.</b> This Article identifies several legal pillars of the present parental-fault paradigm that impede a public health approach and conceptualizes new laws designed to foster a public health approach. First, mandatory reporting and mandatory investigation laws—requiring professionals to report and child protection agencies to investigate all instances of suspected neglect—inhibit a public health response by imposing a coercive legal regime on an overly broad category of cases and preventing professionals from making more effective interventions for millions of children. Second, state laws’ overly broad definitions of “abuse” and “neglect” expand the range of situations subject to mandatory reporting and mandatory investigations laws and permit coercive interventions to become the dominant means of responding to serious <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>problems.</b> Third, the law should separate provision of services to children and families from findings of fault by CPS agencies. In the aggregate, families involved with CPS agencies have relatively high levels of need and would benefit from services provided as soon as possible. Yet CPS agencies tie services to findings of fault, denying services to many families. Fourth, federal funding law should cease preferred treatment of foster care and permit greater flexibility to provide a full spectrum of interventions. Fifth, the law should identify institutions, such as schools, hospitals, and doctors, poised to implement a public health approach and should develop legal reforms to push those institutions to do so...|$|R

40|$|One hanging {{question}} in <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> policy and research {{is whether there}} is an artificial overrepresentation of the poor in <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> caseloads or whether this reflects the co-occurrence of poverty and need. In order to address this question, this study uses data from <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> (report, assessment, service and re-report), income maintenance, special education, hospitals, juvenile court, public mental health treatment, and census data. Poor children reported to <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> are compared to non-poor children reported to <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> and also to poor children not reported to <b>child</b> <b>welfare.</b> Poor <b>children</b> reported for maltreatment had greater risk factors at the parent and neighborhood levels and higher rates of negative outcomes than children in either comparison group.

Despite parents describing both positive and negative experiences, and trust as well as distrust, we found that fear of the <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> services was a central theme. Thematic analyses showed that fear of the <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> services was not primarily related to the interviewees' own negative experiences, but to a variety of perceptions or representations of the <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> services that informants described as common or prevalent among people from ethnic minorities in general. We found that the representations of the <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> services could be categorized into the following themes: 1) <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> services primarily take children away from parents, 2) <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> services do not go into dialogue with parents, and 3) <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> services discriminate against ethnic minority families. The analysis is discussed critically in light of Axel Honneth and Nancy Fraser's understandings of recognition and social justice.

However, {{there is only}} a very limited literature concerning help-seeking in <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> and a distinct dearth of studies that have examined the social organisation of parents' decisions to seek help. Recent developments in <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> services in England and Wales have seen the introduction of a raft of initiatives that aim to deliver parenting support to a broader range of parents; however, these initiatives are not well grounded in an evidence base concerning parental help-seeking. Focusing on the organisation of talk-in-interaction in interviews and focus groups, this study examined parents' normative and inter-subjective understandings about help-seeking. The study found that when considering the <b>welfare</b> <b>problems</b> of parenting (variously described as 'domestic', 'normal' or 'on the home front'), participants routinely made relevant the binary 'inside/outside' the family, indicating the central (normative) relevance of the category 'family' for this kind of support.

40|$|In 2004, the <b>Child</b> <b>Welfare</b> Reform (CWR) was {{introduced}} in Norway. One {{of the most important}} goals of the reform was to strengthen State level authority in public <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> and establish equal <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> services across the country. The aim {{of this article is to}} study how this new reform affected the work of municipal <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> professionals and led to the development of a regional project called New <b>Child</b> <b>Welfare</b> (NCW). Based on qualitative interviews with central actors in NCW, regarding the interaction between state and local <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> professionals, the article shows how professionals within local <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> reacted on the CWR.
