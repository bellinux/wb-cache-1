5|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, the Organization for European Economic Cooperation (now the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) {{had made}} several {{attempts}} {{to create a}} framework for protecting international investments, but its efforts revealed conflicting views on how to provide compensation for the expropriation of foreign direct investment. In 1961, then-General <b>Counsel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) Aron Broches developed {{the idea for a}} multilateral agreement on a process for resolving individual investment disputes on a case by case basis as opposed to imposing outcomes based on standards. Broches held conferences to consult legal experts {{from all parts of the}} world, including Europe, Africa, and Asia, to discuss and compose a preliminary agreement. The IBRD staff wrote an official draft of the agreement and consulted with legal representatives of the IBRD's board of directors to finalize the draft and have it approved. The board of directors approved the final draft of the agreement, titled Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, and the Bank president disseminated the convention to its member states for signature on 18 March 1965. Twenty states immediately ratified the convention. The convention establishing the ICSID entered into force on 14 October 1966.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} into <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> {{music as a}} part <b>of</b> pastoral <b>counselling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adolescent. Pastoral <b>counselling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adolescent could be a challenge, because adolescence is a period characterised by emotional fluctuation. During this period <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual�s life, he or she begins to form {{his or her own}} identity and searches for a place in society, apart from <b>the</b> protection <b>of</b> their parents. Adolescents often do not have the necessary skills to deal with repressed emotions. Research shows that music has been used for many centuries in the healing process and that it has had a great influence on <b>the</b> psyche <b>of</b> human beings. For this reason, music can play an effective role in counselling adolescents. Music therapy involves <b>the</b> structural use <b>of</b> music and/or musical elements like rhythm, melody and harmony. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} paper focuses {{upon the}} crises and challenge facing all South Mricans as the AIDS pandemic escalates. Itbriefly discusses <b>the</b> broader implica-tions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pandemic {{for the economic}} and social well-being <b>of</b> <b>the</b> South African population at large, and then attends to issues associated with <b>the</b> <b>counselling</b> <b>of</b> persons living with mv, <b>the</b> <b>counselling</b> <b>of</b> counsellors and <b>the</b> <b>counselling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> survivors <b>of</b> families and groups affected by AIDS-related deaths. The paper first distinguishes between reality-based concerns and transference responses for persons with HN, and suggests that counselling these persons is sup-portive rather than dynamic in its focus. Thereafter various countertransference responses are identified. The paper suggests that counsellors will themselves require counselling and support if their continued involvement in <b>the</b> <b>counselling</b> and care <b>of</b> persons withmv is to be assured. Finally, the possibility oflarge scale delayed and complicated grief reactions among the population at large, as a result of multiple and continuous losses of friends and family to AIDS-related deaths, is addressed. The paper evaluates possible intervention strategies for dealing with the pandemic and argues that while education programmes are laudable, more empha-sis will need to be placed upon dealing with the crisis at hand. <b>The</b> training <b>of</b> counsellors and caregivers, as well as bereavement <b>counselling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population at large will thus need to take priority. The paper concludes that while AIDS is a devastating and tragic pandemic that will affect all levels <b>of</b> our society, <b>the</b> pandemic also offers an opportunity to rebuild and reintegrate South Africa's shattered 'community of communities'...|$|R
