6000|$|On a {{pleasant}} afternoon of June, {{it was my}} good fortune to be the companion of two young ladies in a walk. The direction of our course being left to me, I led them neither to Legge's Hill, nor to the Cold Spring, nor to the rude shores and old batteries of the Neck, nor yet to Paradise; though if the latter place were rightly named, my fair friends {{would have been at}} home there. We reached the outskirts of the town, and turning aside from a street of tanners and curriers, began to ascend a hill, which at a distance, by its dark slope and the even line of its summit, resembled a green rampart along the road. It was less steep than its aspect threatened. The eminence formed part of an extensive tract of pasture land, and was traversed by <b>cow</b> <b>paths</b> in various directions; but, strange to tell, though the whole slope and summit were of a peculiar deep green, scarce a blade of grass was visible from the base upward. This deceitful verdure was occasioned by a plentiful crop of [...] "wood-wax," [...] which wears the same dark and glossy green throughout the summer, except at one short period, when it puts forth a profusion of yellow blossoms. At that season, to a distant spectator, the hill appears absolutely overlaid with gold, or covered with a glory of sunshine, even beneath a clouded sky. But the curious wanderer on the hill will perceive that all the grass, and everything that should nourish man or beast, has been destroyed by this vile and ineradicable weed: its tufted roots make the soil their own, and permit nothing else to vegetate among them; so that a physical curse may be said to have blasted the spot, where guilt and frenzy consummated the most execrable scene that our history blushes to record. For this was the field where superstition won her darkest triumph; the high place where our fathers set up their shame, to the mournful gaze of generations far remote. The dust of martyrs was beneath our feet. We stood on Gallows Hill.|$|E

40|$|Soil {{compaction}} is {{a common}} agricultural and urban landscape problem, particularly along <b>cow</b> <b>paths</b> and social trails, respectively. The social trail in the green space of Hardin Hall on the University of Nebraska- Lincoln East Campus has visual cues of soil compaction, due to the slow rate of water infiltration and lack of vegetation. Being the focus area of this study, a sampling grid {{was placed on the}} trail by measuring and sectioning it into equal sections. These sections were further divided into subsections of on-path and off-path for comparison. Soil structure, texture, bulk density, and water infiltration were analyzed to determine the severity of soil compaction occurring on this social trail. Both soil structure and soil texture were found to be the same when comparing on-path and off-path samples. Bulk density was found to be significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 001) higher for the on-path samples compared to off-path samples. Water infiltration rates were also significantly (p = 0. 002) slower for the on-path samples compared to off-path samples. These results indicate that, due to being the same on- and off-path, soil structure and texture can be excluded as a cause for the difference of bulk density and water infiltration rates. Significantly higher bulk densities and slower water infiltration indicate that soil compaction is occurring on the Hardin Hall social trail...|$|E

50|$|Columbia Pike {{dates to}} 1810 when the U.S. Congress {{chartered}} a turnpike Company to build three separate roads through {{the newly formed}} District of Columbia to outlying destinations.

The new road was built on a pre-existing <b>cow</b> <b>path</b> as the Washington Graveled Turnpike and was also known as the Washington Road, the Columbian Road, and the Arlington Turnpike.

60|$|Such was {{the general}} {{character}} of the dwellings of the Monguls {{in the days of}} Genghis Khan.

One would have thought that very excellent roads would have been necessary to have enabled them to draw the ponderous carts containing their dwellings and household goods. But this was less necessary than might have been supposed on account {{of the nature of the}} country, which consisted chiefly of immense grassy plains and smooth river valleys, over which, in many places, wheels would travel tolerably well in any direction without much making of roadway. Then, again, in all such countries, the people who journey from place to place, and the herds of cattle that move to and fro, naturally fall into the same lines of travel, and thus, in time, wear great trails, as <b>cows</b> make <b>paths</b> in a pasture. These, with a little artificial improvement at certain points, make very good summer roads, and in the winter it is not necessary to use them at all.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{considers a}} suite of search problems in which agents {{are trying to find}} goals in minimum expected time. Unlike search in data structures in which time is measured by a number operations, search in metric spaces measures time by units of distance and has received much less attention. In particular, search strategies that attempt to minimize expected search time are only available for a handful of relatively simple cases. Nonetheless many relevant search problems take place in metric spaces. This dissertation includes several concrete examples from navigation and surveillance that would have previously only been approachable by much more ad hoc methods. We visit these examples along the way to establishing relevance to a much larger set of problems. We present a policy that is an extension of Whittle's index heuristic and is applicable under the following assumptions. * The location of goals are independent random variables. " The agents and goals are in a length space, i. e., a metric space with continuous paths. * The agents move along continuous paths with bounded speed. " The agents' sensing is noiseless. We demonstrate the performance of our policy by applying it to a diverse set of problems for which solutions are available in the literature. We treat each of the following problems as a special case of a more general search problem: " search in one-dimensional spaces such as the Line Search Problem (LSP) and <b>Cow</b> <b>Path</b> Problem (CPP), " search in two-dimensional spaces such as the Lost in a Forest Problem (LFP) and problems of coverage, " problems in networks such as the Graph Search Problem (GSP) and Minimum Latency Tour Problem (MLTP), and " dynamic problems such as the Persistent Patrol Problem (PPP) and Dynamic Traveling Repairperson Problem (DTRP). On each of these we find that our policy performs comparably to, and occasionally better than, the accepted solutions developed specifically for these problems. As a result, we believe that this dissertation contributes a significant inroad into a large space of search problems that meets our assumptions, but that remains unaddressed. by Thomas. J. Temple.

60|$|At length the unwearied, never-sinking shore, {{still holding}} on without break, with its cool copses and serene pasture-grounds, tempted us to disembark; and we adventurously landed on this remote coast, to survey it, without the {{knowledge}} of any human inhabitant probably to this day. But we still remember the gnarled and hospitable oaks which grew even there for our entertainment, and were no strangers to us, the lonely horse in his pasture, and the patient <b>cows,</b> whose <b>path</b> to the river, so judiciously chosen to overcome the difficulties of the way, we followed, and disturbed their ruminations in the shade; and, above all, the cool, free aspect of the wild apple-trees, generously proffering their fruit to us, though still green and crude,--the hard, round, glossy fruit, which, if not ripe, still was not poison, but New-English too, brought hither its ancestors by ours once. These gentler trees imparted a half-civilized and twilight aspect to the otherwise barbarian land. Still farther on we scrambled up the rocky channel of a brook, which had long served nature for a sluice there, leaping like it from rock to rock through tangled woods, {{at the bottom of}} a ravine, which grew darker and darker, and more and more hoarse the murmurs of the stream, until we reached the ruins of a mill, where now the ivy grew, and the trout glanced through the crumbling flume; and there we imagined what had been the dreams and speculations of some early settler. But the waning day compelled us to embark once more, and redeem this wasted time with long and vigorous sweeps over the rippling stream.|$|R
50|$|Only {{the post-war}} era with its “Economic Miracle” and the {{introduction}} of technology into agriculture was to bring the village meaningful change. Already during the war, some young people from Roth had been studying at higher schools in Bingen am Rhein. The first to pass his Abitur was Josef Steyer, the miner Peter Steyer III’s son. Ever more villagers sought livelihoods outside farming. While the number of full-time operations in agriculture had already shrunk to 12 by 1950, by 1987 there were only two left: Albrecht Ney and Rudi Sturm. The latter busied himself mainly as a winemaker, although all his vineyards lay outside Roth’s municipal area in other municipalities. Even Mr. Ney, though, only worked 10% of the 100 ha that he owned within Roth’s limits. The other 90% lay outside. This, by the way, made his lands bigger than the municipality, which is only 84 ha in size. The ore pit that had been so important during the war has been disused since 1971. The limeworks in Stromberg, too, is no longer an economic factor to the inhabitants of Roth. In 1980, 38.9% of the workforce commuted to Bingen, 13.2% to Mainz, 11% to Stromberg, 9.7% to Rümmelsheim (Pieroth), 6.6% to Rheinböllen (Tewes), 5.6% to Bad Kreuznach and the rest elsewhere. On the other hand, 27 workers now commute into the village where they have found jobs at two businesses. In connection with this, the road planned as Bundesstraße 400 and built as Autobahn 14 - and now called the A 61 - which brings Roth a great deal of noise and air pollution, has shown its positive side. With this highway, Roth is well linked to the road network. The best way to drive to Bingen, however, is still the former Bundesstraße 50, now called Landesstraße 214 (the same road along which the American tanks came to free the prisoners). After long and intensive efforts on the municipality’s part, Roth was linked on 1 May 1970 to the Stromberg-Bingen bus route. From 1953 to 1978, there was a postal agency in Roth. The Gasthaus zur Alten Linde (“Inn at the Old Limetree”), owned by the Families Kasper and Orben, was closed in 1991, and thus vanished the village’s social hub. Happily, however, Reinhold Sturm opened a Straußwirtschaft “in der Trift” (a street) on 8 August 2003, furnishing the village with a new social hub. Like all Straußwirtschaften, though, it is not open the year round, only for six or seven months out of the year. After the district extended the linking road to Bundesstraße 50 into the village centre in 1956, the municipality began to expand its village street step by step. Already by 1963, a mechanical sewage treatment plant had been built for DM 54,000, which still serves today as a retention basin. Since the building opportunities in the municipality were very limited, municipal council decided as early as 1965 to develop the “Im Hoppenacker”-“An dem Stemel” building plan so that, among other things, younger villagers would not be forced to build elsewhere. After the village streets had been updated in 1967, it became possible {{in the years that followed}} to begin work on the “An dem Stemel” phase of the building plan. As early as 1971, thoughts turned to satisfying the further demand for building land, and so, in the years that followed, a further building zone, called “In der Nonnenwies”, was opened (this is actually a street’s name, and it seems that until 1889, when the municipality gave up keeping cattle, it was a <b>cow</b> <b>path</b> called der Kuhweg, which means just that in German; its current name, however, means “in the nuns’ meadow”). This new building zone drew quite a bit of interest from outside Roth, likely because of the favourable land prices and location. Roth’s population figures, which for many years had been fairly constant, falling somewhere between 160 and 180 at any given time, had by 1987 risen to 286. From all records it is clear that the municipality was in great financial need. By 1955, Amtsbürgermeister Bogerts still believed that Roth would always be a “problem child” given its chronic poverty in assets and tax revenue. The municipal budget all too often ended up in the red. In the years from 1955 to 1971, the forest cost the municipality some DM 26,500; another DM 61,000 was spent in the years that followed, and in 1987, DM 12,000 more was spent. By selling plots of municipal land for the construction of the Autobahn in 1963, the municipality finally came into some money (so Mr. Bogerts declared - the same man who only eight years earlier had had such a grim forecast for Roth’s financial future). The sales brought in DM 93,000. This seems to have been a turning point in the municipality’s economic development. Higher population figures and a shift in livelihood circumstances have since considerably improved the municipality’s economic power.|$|R
