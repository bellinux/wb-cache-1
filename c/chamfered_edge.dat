The model effectively overcomes serious element distortions and cell singularity in high strain domain caused by large material deformation. The effects of cutting edge preparation on cutting force, cutting temperature and residual stress are analyzed. Results of FEM show that cutting edge preparation {{has a great}} impact on cutting procedure. Under the same cutting condition, cutting force, temperature and residual stress of sharp edge, honed edge and <b>chamfered</b> <b>edge</b> increases in turn, and three kinds of cutting edge have the same change rule in residual stress. <b>Chamfered</b> <b>edge</b> has a good temperature distributing, and it is the best edge preparation in hard cutting...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Due to {{the high}} {{strength}} of austenitic stainless steels, {{it is essential for}} cutting tool to keep with appropriate chamfered edges during the face milling process. In this paper, face milling mechanics with <b>chamfered</b> <b>edge</b> based on cutting force and chip formation were analyzed through finite element analysis (FEA). Three kinds of tools with different chamfered edges were studied on face milling of 1 Cr 18 Ni 9 Ti austenitic stainless steel. The primary research results indicated that FEA results showed good consistency with experimental results. This can provide references for development and application of tools during face milling process...|$|E

In this paper, cutting {{experiment}} and FEM simulation are combined {{to investigate the}} effect of various <b>chamfered</b> <b>edge</b> geometries on cutting force and cutting temperature distribution when hardened steel GCr 15 (HRC 60 + 2) is machined with PCBN tool. The research results indicate that radial force and main cutting force increase with the enlargement of chamfer angle, and especially, radial force rises more significantly, but radial force is less than main cutting force during the entire cutting process. Cutting temperature also gradually rises as chamfer angle increases, and moreover, it is maximized on the chip-tool interface {{in a place of}} 0. 1 - 0. 2 mm distant from nose...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the experimental investigation {{on the effect}} of edge geometry of coated carbide inserts on cutting performance during face milling of titanium alloy, Ti- 6 Al 4 V. Two similar PVD-TiN coated inserts with different edge geometry were used in the face milling experiment at various cutting speeds of 55, 65 80 and 100 m/min with a feed rate of 0. 1 mm/tooth. Tool life and tool failure characteristics were examined at the above cutting conditions. Results showed that edge geometry had a significant effect on the tool performance. Insert with sharp cutting edge was observed to perform better than <b>chamfered</b> <b>edge</b> insert at all conditions investigated. Excessive chipping at the cutting edge and chipping and/or flaking on the rake face were the dominant failure modes on both tools under most cutting conditions...|$|E

An Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) based {{numerical modelling}} is employed for 3 -D precision hard turning. The Johnson-Cook plasticity model is {{used to describe the}} work material behaviour. A detailed friction modelling at the tool-chip and tool-work interfaces is also carried. Work material flow around the chamfer geometry of the cutting edge is carefully modelled with adaptive meshing simulation capability.

Results revealed good agreements between FEM results and those reported in literature about experimental ones...|$|E

In this study, 3 -D finite element {{modeling}} of precision hard turning {{has been used to}} investigate the effects of cutting edge microgeometry on tool forces, temperatures and stresses in machining of AISI H 13 steel using polycrystalline cubic boron nitrite (PCBN) inserts with two distinct edge preparations. Hard turning experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of cutting edge geometry, feed rate and cutting speed on tool flank wear and resultant forces. During hard turning experiments, lowgrade PCBN inserts with honed and <b>chamfered</b> <b>edge</b> preparations and through-hardened AISI H- 13 steel bars were used. Three components of tool forces and flank wear of the inserts were measured. PCBN inserts with honed microgeometry cutting edge resulted in lower tool flank wear in all cutting conditions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to propose a method of strain {{measurements}} under multi-axial stress condition. By adopting the cube specimen, we can apply the load different from each other in three directions. At the triaxial test, six steel brushes covered the specimen, and there was no space to put wire strain gages or displacement devices on the surfaces of the specimen. Therefore, the cube specimen with <b>chamfered</b> <b>edges</b> was selected to measure strains by utilizing the <b>chamfered</b> <b>edges.</b> Six pairs of displacement measuring devices were set on the <b>chamfered</b> <b>edges</b> of the specimen in three directions (α, β, γ) as shown in Fig. 2. The deformation in a specific direction was measured as the sum of the outputs from a pair of displacement devices placed in the diagonal and opposite edges in the same direction of the specimen. The strains, ε_X, Ε_Y and E_Z in X, Y and Z directions can be written in the equation (10), as the terms higher than the second order are negligibly small. The experimental strains that were measured in the manner described above are compared with the strains that were measured with wire strain gages mounted on its sides, both in the uniaxial compression test of the same specimen. The stress-strain relations of the two were almost the same, so that the validity of the method of strain measurement proposed in this study is experimentally proved...|$|R

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{technological}} and economic considerations required to select face milling vs. surface grinding operations {{in the manufacture of}} hardened steel flat surfaces for dies and moulds. In terms of technological considerations, factors such as component geometry, material and surface quality (dimensional tolerance and surface finish) are taken into account. The economic considerations include the cost of machine depreciation, labour and consumables (cutting tools in face milling vs. grinding wheels and dressing tool in surface grinding). A case study is presented based on the prismatic components in ceramic tile moulds and their associated manufacturing operations. Surface grinding and face milling experimentation was conducted on cold work steel AISI D 3 (with hardness of 60 HRC) with aluminium oxide grinding wheels and coated tungsten carbide cutting tool, respectively. Technological attributes and economics of face milling are compared with surface grinding of this type of mould components. The main conclusion is that face milling with <b>chamfered</b> <b>edge</b> preparation in coated tungsten carbide tools is a competitive process, compared with surface grinding, in terms of product quality and economics...|$|E
40|$|Butt joints of A 5052 {{aluminum}} alloy and SS 400 steel, {{with a new}} type of <b>chamfered</b> <b>edge,</b> are welded by means of metal inert gas welding and ER 4043 Al-Si filler metal. The microhardness and microstructure of the joint are investigated. An intermetallic layer is found {{on the surface of the}} welding seam and SS 400 steel sheet. The hardness of the intermetallic layer is examined using the Vickers hardness test. The average hardness values at the Intermetallic (IMC) layer zone and without the IMC layer zone were higher than that of the welding wire ER 4043. The tensile strength test showed a fracture at the intermetallic layer when the tensile strength is 225. 9 MPa. The tensile value test indicated the average of welds was equivalent to the 85 % tensile strength of the A 5052 {{aluminum alloy}}. The thickness of the intermetallic layers is non-uniform at different positions with the ranges from 1. 95 to 5 μm. The quality of the butt joint is better if the intermetallic layer is minimized.

40|$|The tile is an {{elongated}} octagon in shape. It has a blue tinted glaze, and bright blue decoration with the motto in maroon. The {{sides of the}} tile are chamfered, and the glaze on the back is in irregular patches. The design of the Society of Apothecaries ' Arms-with ribbon-like scrollwork {{to the sides of}} Apollo, who has an unusual 'Red Indian ' headdress-is quite distinct from the common versions of the Arms on such tiles. The Fitzwilliam Museum tile has exactly the same dimensions as the Wellcome tile (30 x 24. 6 x 1. 4 cms.), the Drake tile being fractionally smaller (29. 8 x 24. 1 x 1. 4 cms.). Both tiles have the blue tinted glaze, unusual <b>chamfered</b> <b>edge,</b> and the partially glazed back characteristic of the Wellcome tile.

This is further support for the view that the tiles were not custom made (see above). Furthermore, the almost identical size and shape of the three tiles suggests an element of mass production...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a numerically controlled finishing system, the Advanced Deburring and Chamfering System (ADACS). ADACS employs a user friendly, Graphical User Interface (GUI) to off-line program finishing and <b>chamfering</b> <b>edges</b> and prompt the operator for part cutting parameters. Given the operator-designated finishing and <b>chamfering</b> <b>edges,</b> ADACS extracts the features {{to generate a}} part finishing process plan. Collisions with the environment are detected and avoided through simulation of the cutting path before the path is downloaded to the actual hardware. ADACS interprets the finishing plan to generate motion trajectories that are tightly coupled to the tooling control. Because position control is too inaccurate for the required tolerances, ADACS uses active force control in the tool to compensate for any nominal error along the finishing path. This allows the cutter to apply a constant force to the edge. The ADACS approach to finishing parts can significantly reduce the manufacturing cost of a part by reducing rework and scrap, and improving process consistency and quality. A prototype ADACS has been built and successfully applied to aerospace test part...|$|R
