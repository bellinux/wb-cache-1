40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel {{solution to the}} age long problem of password security at input level. In our solution, each of the various characters from which a password could be composed is encoded with a random single digit integer and presented to the user via an input interface form. A legitimate user entering his password only needs to carefully study the sequence of code that describe his password, and then enter these code in place of his actual password characters. This approach {{does not require the}} input code to be hidden from anyone or converted to placeholder characters for security reasons. Our solution engine regenerates new code for each character each time the <b>carriage</b> return <b>key</b> is struck, producing a hardened password that is convincingly more secure than conventional password entry system against both online and offline attackers. Using empirical data and a prototype implementation of our scheme, we give evidence that our approach is viable in practice, in terms of ease of use, improved security, and performance.

40|$|Introduction Many {{injuries}} {{experienced by}} soldiers {{can be attributed}} to the occupational loads they are required to carry. Purpose The aim of this study was to determine whether contemporary military load carriage is a source of injuries to Australian Regular Army soldiers and to profile these injuries. Methods The Australian Defence Force ‘Occupational Health, Safety and Compensation Analysis and Reporting’ database was searched to identify all reported injuries sustained during load <b>carriage</b> events. <b>Key</b> search terms were employed and narrative description fields were interrogated to increase data accuracy. Results A total of 1, 954 injury records were extracted from the database. Of these, 404 injuries were attributed to load carriage. The majority of these load carriage injuries involved either the lower limb or back, with bones and joints accounting for the most frequently reported body structures to be injured. Field activities were the leading activities being performed at the time that load carriage injuries occurred, and muscular stress was identified as the mechanism of injury for over half of reported load carriage injuries. Conclusion This study suggests that load carriage is a substantial source of injury risk to Australian Army soldiers. Physical training may fail to adequately prepare soldiers for load carriage tasks during field training exercises...|$|R
40|$|FOCUS is a {{user-friendly}} {{computer program}} {{to generate the}} changing appearance of a system as an observer changes the viewing criteria. The criteria are measured by time and space scales {{and the range of}} scales is determined by the interests of the user. These interests may apply to any organised system but FOCUS has been documented in the context of resource studies. In that context, the controlling structure and functioning of a managed resource system might be compared over long and short terms and over local and regional areas. The program further permits a comparison of alternative system regimes, such as current and future management prospects, and is used to identify local subsystems. White (1988) gives an illustrated summary of theory and program application in the companion text to this manual. Some elements only are included in the manual and in the documented printout of each FOCUS analysis. Analyses are based on aspects of hierarchy theory and the user is referred to Allen and Starr (1982) and O'Neill et. al. (1986). Program control acts through a menu of options which is re-displayed after each task has been performed. There are 11 numbered options in the main menu. To choose an option the corresponding number should be typed and the <b>carriage</b> return <b>key</b> « RETURN» pressed. If the number entered was not a valid input an error message will be displayed...|$|R

40|$|Colonization of the {{nasopharynx}} is {{the initial}} step in all infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. The antibody response to carriage was examined in an experimental model of human colonization in healthy adults. Asymptomatic colonization was detected in 6 / 14 subjects and continued {{for up to}} 122 d. Susceptibility to carriage did not correlate with total serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G to the homotypic capsular polysaccharide. All of the colonized subjects, in contrast, developed a serum IgG and secretory IgA response to a 22 kD protein, whereas 7 of 8 subjects who did not become colonized had preexisting antibody to this protein. Analysis of the 22 kD protein identified it as the NH 2 -terminal region of pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA).

40|$|Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is the {{predominant}} cause of {{urinary tract infection}} in both hospital and community set-tings. The recent emergence of multidrug-resistant clones like the O 25 b:H 4 -ST 131 lineage represents a significant threat to health, and numerous studies have explored the virulence potential of these organisms. Members of the ST 131 clone {{have been described as}} having variable <b>carriage</b> of <b>key</b> virulence factors, and {{it has been suggested that}} additional unidentified factors con-tribute to virulence. Here we demonstrated that ST 131 isolates have highmetabolic potential and biochemical profiles that dis-tinguish them from isolates of many other sequence types (STs). A collection of 300 UPEC isolates recovered in 2007 and 2009 in the Northwest region of England were subjected to metabolic profiling using the Vitek 2 Advanced Expert System (AES). Of the 47 tests carried out, 30 gave a positive result with at least one of the 300 isolates examined. ST 131 isolates demonstrated signifi-cant association with eight tests, including those for peptidase, decarboxylase, and alkalinization activity. Metabolic activity also correlated with antibiotic susceptibility profiles, with resistant organisms displaying the highest metabolic potential. This is the first comprehensive study of metabolic potential in the ST 131 lineage, and we suggest that high metabolic potential may have contributed to the fitness of members of the ST 131 clone, which are able to exploit the available nutrients in both the intestinal and urinary tract environments. Escherichia coli is a very diversemember of the normal intestinalflora of humans and other mammals. Some E. coli bacteria ar...|$|R
40|$|QL Quill is a {{sophisticated}} wordprocessor. It {{has been designed}} to give you the maximum in power and flexibility, yet is still easy to learn and to use. As you will see later, you will always be kept informed as to what you can do next and how to do it. You can use a wordprocessor in any circumstance where you would otherwise use a typewriter. The twomachines are very similar in function, although the wordprocessor has many advantagesthat are not matched by a conventional typewriter Perhaps the most obvious difference is the ease with which mistakes can be corrected. Since the text is not printed immediately as you type It in, you can make as many corrections as you wish. You need only print the text when you are sure that it is exactly what you want and can therefore be assured of perfect results every time. As you will see, ny working through this manual,, {{there are a number of}} other advantages. For example, when using a typewriter, it is necessary to press the <b>carriage</b> return <b>key</b> at the end of every line. In Quill, this function is performed automatically. Whenever the printed text reaches the end of a line, a new line is starfed; you press ENTER when you want to start a new paragraph. Whenever a new line is started you will notice that the spacing of the text in the last line will be adjusted so that the left and right margins are lined up throughout the text. This process, which is known as justification, gives a highly professional appearance to the final result, without an...|$|R
40|$|Background. Intestinal <b>carriage</b> is a <b>key</b> {{factor in}} extended-spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL) {{infection}} epidemiology but {{is difficult to}} study in open communities. To overcome this problem, we studied a highly stable group of Amerindians for whom we reported an ESBL carriage prevalence of 3. 2 % in 2001. Methods. In 2006, ESBL carriage was assessed among 163 healthy volunteer adults. ESBL isolates were identified, and their molecular resistance mechanisms were characterized. Antibiotic use {{in the year before}} sampling and the epidemiological characteristics of the population were analyzed. Results were compared to those obtained in 2001. Results. In 2006, the ESBL carriage prevalence, exclusively comprising Escherichia coli, was 8. 0 %. It mainly consisted of CTX-M–type ESBL. The strains and plasmids carrying ESBL were heterogeneous, but 1 CTX-M- 2 – producing strain was found in 4. 3 % of the subjects analyzed. No individual risk factor was identified. However, overall antibiotic use had almost doubled since 2001. A 3 -fold increase was noted for b-lactams. Conclusions. In this population, the frequency of ESBL increased with time because of the appearance of CTX...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{increasing}} {{incidence of}} community acquired infection due to Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) -Producing Enterobacteriaceae represent a great concern {{because there are}} few therapeutic alternatives. The fecal flora {{of children in the}} community can represent a reservoir for ESBLs genes which are located on highly transmissible plasmids and the spread of these genes among bacterial pathogens is concerning. Because intestinal <b>carriage</b> is a <b>key</b> factor in the epidemiology of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, the study of the prevalence of these resistant bacteria and risk factors in young children is of particular interest. Methods We assessed the prevalence and risk factors of community-acquired faecal carriage of extended-spectrum-β-lactamase (ESBL) -producing Enterobacteriaceae in children aged from 6 to 24 months, by means of rectal swabbing in community pediatric practices. Child’s lifestyle and risk factors for carriage of resistant bacteria were noted. Results Among the 411 children enrolled, 4. 6 % carried ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. CTX-M- 1, CTX-M- 15 and CTX-M- 14 were the predominant ESBLs. The 18 E. coli isolates were genetically heterogeneous. Recent third-generation oral-cephalosporin exposure was associated with a higher risk of ESBL carriage (AOR= 3. 52, 95 % CI[1. 06 - 11. 66], p= 0. 04). Conclusions The carriage rate of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriacae in young children in the French community setting is noteworthy, underlining the importance of this population as a reservoir. Exposure to third-generation oral cephalosporins was associated with a significant risk of ESBL carriage in our study. Because of the significant public health implications including the treatment of community-acquired urinary tract infections, the spread of organisms producing ESBLs in the community merits close monitoring with enhanced efforts for surveillance. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background With {{the removal}} of gender {{restrictions}} and {{the changing nature of}} warfare potentially increasing female soldier exposure to heavy military load carriage, the aim of this research was to determine relative risks and patterns of load carriage related injuries in female compared to male soldiers. Methods The Australian Defence Force Occupational Health, Safety and Compensation Analysis and Reporting workplace injury database was searched to identify all reported load <b>carriage</b> injuries. Using <b>key</b> search terms, the narrative description fields were used as the search medium to identify records of interest. Population estimates of the female: male incident rate ratio (IRR) were calculated with ninety-five percent confidence interval (95 % CI) around the population estimate of each IRR determined. Results Female soldiers sustained 10 % (n[*]=[*] 40) of the 401 reported injuries, with a female to male IRR of 1. 02 (95 % CI 0. 74 to 1. 41). The most common site of injury for both genders was the back (F: n[*]=[*] 11, 27 %; M: n[*]=[*] 80, 22 %), followed by the foot in female soldiers (n[*]=[*] 8, 20 %) and the ankle (n[*]=[*] 60, 17 %) in male soldiers. Fifteen percent (n[*]=[*] 6) of injuries in female soldiers and 6 % (n[*]=[*] 23) of injuries in males were classified as Serious Personal Injuries (SPI) with the lower back the leading site for both genders (F: n[*]=[*] 3, 43 %: M: n[*]=[*] 8, 29 %). The injury risk ratio of SPI for female compared to male soldiers was 2. 40 (95 % CI 0. 98 to 5. 88). Conclusions While both genders similarly have the lower back as the leading site of injury while carrying load, female soldiers have more injuries to the foot as the second leading site of injury, as opposed to ankle injuries in males. The typically smaller statures of female soldiers may have predisposed them to their observed higher risk of suffering SPI while carrying loads...|$|R
