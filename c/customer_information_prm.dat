40|$|Service {{researchers}} have repeatedly claimed that firms should acquire <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> {{in order to}} develop services that fit customer needs. Despite this, studies that would concentrate on the actual use of <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> in service development are lacking. The present study fulfils this research gap by investigating information use during a service development process. It demonstrates that use is not a straightforward task that automatically follows the acquisition of <b>customer</b> <b>information.</b> In fact, out of the six identified types of use, four represent non usage of <b>customer</b> <b>information.</b> Hence, the study demonstrates that the acquisition of <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> does not guarantee that the information will actually be used in development. The current study used an ethnographic approach. Consequently, the study was conducted in the field in real time over an extensive period of 13 months. Participant observation allowed direct access to the investigated phenomenon, i. e. the different types of use by the observed development project members were captured while they emerged. In addition, interviews, informal discussions and internal documents were used to gather data. A development process of a bank’s website constituted the empirical context of the investigation. This ethnography brings novel insights to both academia and practice. It critically questions the traditional focus on the firm’s acquisition of <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> and suggests that this focus ought to be expanded to the actual use of <b>customer</b> <b>information.</b> What is the point in acquiring costly <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> if it is not used in the development? Based on the findings of this study, a holistic view on <b>customer</b> <b>information,</b> “information in use” is generated. This view extends the traditional view of <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> in three ways: the source, timing and form of data collection. First, the study showed that the <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> can come explicitly from the customer, from speculation among the developers or it can already exist implicitly. Prior research has mainly focused on the <b>customer</b> as the <b>information</b> provider and the explicit source to turn to for information. Second, the study identified that the used and non-used <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> was acquired both previously, and currently within the time frame of the focal development process, as well as potentially in the future. Prior research has primarily focused on the currently acquired <b>customer</b> <b>information,</b> i. e. within the timeframe of the development process. Third, the used and non-used <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> was both formally and informally acquired. In prior research a large number of sophisticated formal methods have been suggested for the acquisition of <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> to be used in development. By focusing on “information in use”, new knowledge on types of <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> that are actually used was generated. For example, the findings show that the formal <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> acquired during the development process is used less than <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> already existent within the firm. With this knowledge at hand, better methods to capture this more usable <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> can be developed. Moreover, the thesis suggests that by focusing stronger on use of <b>customer</b> <b>information,</b> service development processes can be restructured in order to facilitate the information that is actually used...|$|R
40|$|<b>Customer</b> <b>information</b> {{is to be}} seen as an {{essential}} part in service development. The company should be aware of how their customers experience their services. The company can get access to <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> through complaints from their <b>customers.</b> All <b>information</b> obtained from the customers is not possible to use when developing new and existing services. The information has to be analysed before it is possible to use it for service development. This paper describes if Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) uses their customers as a source of knowledge when developing new and existing services and in that case how. This has been examined through a case study done through qualitative interviews. Our results show that SAS listen to their customers and their opinions about SAS services. Scandinavian Airlines makes many customer surveys and they have a system which stores and categorises customer s complaints. Scandinavian Airlines analyses the <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> and gives recommendations how to repair the insufficient services. <b>Customer</b> <b>information</b> is sometimes used when developing existing services but much more could be used {{because a lot of the}} <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> is analysed and could be valuable knowledge for SAS.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} clarify the {{relationship}} between concentrator and collector in some Transformer Regions, the transformer region <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> management system was proposed based on a low voltage power line carrier technology. The system consists of the <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> detection terminal and the <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> management software. Detection terminal achieves the detection of relationship between concentrator and collector, {{within the scope of}} the common variants, through power line carrier communication technology, and sends the information to the <b>information</b> management server. <b>Customer</b> <b>information</b> management software managed the information,which came from the terminal, using a database technology and displayed the results sorted, achieving the functions of detection terminal—parameter settings, data management, communication function, management functions for user rights.

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explain the {{development}} of ecosystems and platforms to manage <b>customer</b> <b>information,</b> and to identify the management, research and teaching implications of this evolution. Design/methodology/approach This article is based on research and industrial experience of two of the co-authors in customer relationshipmanagement, further developed with other co-authors in the field of business models, the research and teaching experience of the university authors, and cross-functional literature reviews in the areas of strategy, marketing, economics, organizational behaviour and information management. Findings The findings of this paper show that digitalization, cloud computing and new information-based platforms are beginning to change how <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> is being managed, creating new opportunities for improving marketing, customer relationship management and business strategy. Research limitations/implications Needs confirmation of views by primary empirical research. Practical implications Identifies the need for senior marketing management to examine closely how internal and external/public <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> platforms may enhance their capability for managing customers and setting new strategic directions. Originality/value Highlights the move to <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> platforms and identifies how senior managers should consider them as an option for better <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> management and as a basis for new business strategies...|$|R

To date, {{the issue of}} customer participation in online social shopping communities has become an important but underexplored research area in the academic literature. In this study, we examined how online social interactions affect <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> contribution behavior. We also explored the moderating role of customer reputation {{in the relationship between}} observational learning and reinforcement learning as well as <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> contribution behavior. Analyses of panel data from 6, 121 customers in an online social fashion platform revealed that they are significant factors affecting <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> contribution behavior and that reinforcement learning exhibits a stronger effect than observational learning. The results also showed that customer reputation has a significant negative moderating effect on the relationship between observational learning and <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> contribution behavior. This study not only enriched our theoretical understanding of information contribution behavior but also provided guidelines for online social shopping community administrators to better design their community features...|$|R

40|$|The {{power of}} digital {{technology}} serves developers of new services as an access funnel {{to the vast}} amount of <b>customer</b> behavioural <b>information.</b> The utilization of this information is forecasted to differentiate the winners from the losers {{in the market and}} benefit the new service development process. This study explores the phenomenon of <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> in new service development empirically by looking at the industry at the forefront, the gaming industry. By conducting three case studies with leading Swedish game developers, it challenges the previous research assumptions that acquired and disseminated <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> is implicitly used. This study has made significant contributions by investigating the broader context of <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> use and differentiating among three types of use. The findings show that behavioural information is used to backup own decisions or to enhance the developers understanding, but is not directly applied to the decision task. Despite the great potential, this advanced type of <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> is only used in the post-launch stages of new service development, for service iterations. To further validate the findings and explore information use in new service development more in-depth, future research generating contextual detailed realtime data is needed...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This study aims to {{investigate}} how <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> obtained at different phases {{of a new}} product development (NPD) process influences profits from new offerings. Design/methodology/approach – A survey was conducted {{in the context of}} NPD in goods and services. A unique database was constructed that merged key informant survey responses with financial data for 244 firms. This database was used to replicate and extend previous research by posing a number of hypotheses regarding the role of obtaining <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> in NPD. Findings – The results show that obtaining <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> during NPD influences the profits from new offerings, which vary depending on the phase of the NPD process. The financial rewards from obtaining <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> for goods are highest in the early phases of the NPD process and decline in later phases. The financial rewards for services, on the other hand, are high in the early and late phases of the NPD process. Research limitations/implications – The research is based on a survey combined with objective financial data, that is, a combination of different data sources. The research would have benefitted from longer data series and a higher response rate.

40|$|Consumer {{privacy and}} the market for <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> in {{electronic}} retailing are investigated. The value of <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> derives from the ability of firms to identify individual consumers and charge them personalized prices. Two settings are studied, an anonymity regime in which sale of <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> is not possible, and a recognition regime in which a firm may compile and sell a customer list. Welfare comparisons depend critically on whether consumers anticipate sale of the list. If consumers do not foresee sale of their data, then firms possess incentives to charge higher prices under the recognition regime because this enhances {{the value of the}} list. If consumers anticipate sale of the list, then some types engage in strategic demand reduction. This undermines the market for <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> and often results in lower prices than would prevail under the anonymity regime. Firms prefer the recognition regime when consumers are myopic and the anonymity regime when consumers are strategic. More generally, welfare comparisons depend critically on demand elasticity.

40|$|When a {{customer}} interacts with a firm, extensive personal information often is gathered without the individual 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge. Significant risks {{are associated with}} handling this kind of information. Providing protection may {{reduce the risk of}} the loss and misuse of private information, but it imposes some costs on both the firm and its <b>customers.</b> Nevertheless, <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> security breaches still may occur. They have several distinguishing characteristics: (1) typically it is hard to quantify monetary damages related to them; (2) <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> security breaches may be caused by intentional attacks, as well as through unintentional organizational and customer behaviors; and (3) the frequency of such incidents typically is low, although they can be very costly when they occur. As a result, predictive models and explanatory statistical analysis using historical data have not been effective. We present a profit optimization model for <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> security investments. Our approach is based on value-at-risk methods and operational risk modeling from financial economics. The main results of this work are that we: (1) provide guidance on the trade-offs between risk and return in <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> security investments; (2) define the range of efficient investments in technology-supported risk indemnification for sellers; (3) model how to handle government-dictated levels of investment versus self-regulation of investments in technology; and (4) characterize <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> security investment levels when the firm is able to pass some of its costs on to consumers. We illustrate our theoretical findings with empirical data from the Open Security Foundation, as a means of grounding our analysis and offering the reader intuition for the managerial interpretation of our theory and main results. The results show that we can narrow the decision set for solution providers and policy-makers based on the estimable risks and losses associated with <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> security. We also discuss the application of our approach in practice...|$|R
