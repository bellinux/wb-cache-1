50|$|The {{approach}} of the MIKE2 Methodology is to drive implementation of information management projects through a <b>conceptual</b> <b>architecture</b> framework known as strategic architecture for the federated enterprise (SAFE). SAFE goes across applications, data, and infrastructure and is designed to accommodate the inherent complexities of a highly federated organisation.

50|$|<b>Conceptual</b> <b>{{architecture}}</b> {{is a form}} {{of architecture}} that utilizes conceptualism, characterized by an introduction of ideas or concepts from outside of architecture often as a means of expanding the discipline of architecture. This produces an essentially different kind of building than one produced by the widely held 'architect as a master-builder' model, in which craft and construction are the guiding principles. The finished building as product is less important in <b>conceptual</b> <b>architecture,</b> than the ideas guiding them, ideas represented primarily by texts, diagrams, or art installations. Architects that work in this vein are Diller + Scofidio, Bernard Tschumi, Peter Eisenman and Rem Koolhaas.|$|E

As a step towards modeling context-aware systems, we describe basic elements of such a framework. We introduce internal and external context information and define context models. We describe two <b>conceptual</b> <b>architectures</b> for context-aware systems and present their implications for the system design and for the users. Described concepts are illustrated by using an example system. Keywords: Context-aware systems, internal and external context, context models, architectures for context-aware systems. 1...|$|R

40|$|Software {{architecture}} styles {{for developing}} multiuser applications are usually defined at a conceptual level, abstracting such low-level issues of distributed implementation as code replication, caching strategies and concurrency control policies. Ultimately, such <b>conceptual</b> <b>architectures</b> must be cast into code. The iterative design inherent in interactive systems implies that significant evolution {{will take place}} at the conceptual level. Equally, however, evolution occurs at the implementation level in order to tune performance. This paper introduces Dragonfly, a software architecture style that maintains a tight, bidirectional link between conceptual and implementation software architectures, allowing evolution to be performed at either level. Dragonfly has been implemented in the Java-based TeleComputing Developer (TCD) toolkit...|$|R
