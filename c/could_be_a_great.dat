He did not {{take part in the}} team's earlier games because he was ineligible due to NCAA regulations regarding player transfers. In the game that followed, he posted a career-best 26 points as a bench player in a win over Iona. He also added 3 rebounds, an assist, and a steal in the 23 minutes he was on the court. In a seven-minute stretch in the second half, Garland scored 14 straight points. He said after the game, [...] "I used to do it in high school. It kind of felt like high school when I was out there; it just felt good". Garland, who led the Explorers in scoring, also received praise from head coach John Giannini. On December 22, 2012, he had another impactful performance vs Sacred Heart, with six assists in 31 minutes of play. This was also his first-ever start under Giannini. The coach commented about Garland, [...] "He's a very underrated passer. People think because he scored all those points in high school he's a scorer first and foremost. I think he's a very good passer". However, this would be his sole start in his junior year at La Salle. Garland was effective in the opening, First Four round of the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament against Boise State, finishing with a team-high 22 points and, in turn, scoring 20 or more points for the second time as a junior. After the game, Giannini told Garland, [...] "This is why I chased you all over the place, to win NCAA tournament games and see if you <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> player". On March 23, 2014, against the Ole Miss Rebels, Garland made a scooping layup off the backboard with 2.5 seconds left in regulation to send La Salle into the Sweet 16 round of the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. The game-winner was known as the [...] "Southwest Philly Floater," [...] following Garland's post-game comments, in which he said, [...] "That's the Southwest Philly Floater, man. Shoutout to my Cousin Bern, shoutout to my Mom". He made the shot in spite of defensive efforts from the Rebels' 6ft 9 in (2.06 m) center Reginald Buckner, who had blocked the Explorer multiple times in the game. Garland recalled the play, saying, [...] "Time was running out, and I felt like I could get the drive. When I cut, I just saw an opening and took the ball up...I went in there and knew if I could get an open shot, I could make it". Following a defeat to Wichita State that ended the team's tournament run and their season, Garland was averaging 13.1 points, 2.1 rebounds, and 2 assists.|$|E

[...] His act has always consisted of trained animals: a singing parakeet (Parakeet to Meet You), and two all-dancing, all-singing catsone male, Stinkfoot, and one female, Persian Moll. [...] Each of these were creations of true brilliance, but all he has left now is Moll, his ventriloquist's dummy Screwy, and his eager nephew and assistant Buster.

2500|$|In addition, {{there were}} {{divisions}} within the Japanese government between one faction that {{wanted to use the}} crisis to start a war with Britain and another that argued that since the war with China was already compounded the border war with the Soviet Union, starting a third war at this time was unwise. Even more astonishing to the Japanese Army who expected an easy triumph, the Red Army defeated them at the Battle of Khalkhin Gol, which came as a great shock and caused many Japanese generals to lose their bellicosity, if only for a moment. The Japanese Foreign Minister Hachirō Arita regularly met with Cragie and by 22 July 1939 felt that he was winning in his talks. On 26 July 1939, the United States gave the six-month notification that it would not renew the 1911 Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, which increased the amount of economic pressure the British could bring against Japan. The Roosevelt administration had carried its version of appeasement in the Far East, but actions such as the Tientsin incident had persuaded the Americans that Japan was out of control, and the United States needed to start applying economic pressure via such moves like cancelling the 1911 treaty to pressure the Japanese to stop challenging the existing international order in Asia. The Showa Emperor was furious, telling his aide-de-camp Hata Shunroku: [...] "It <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> blow to scrap metal and oil. Even if we can purchase [...] for the next six months, we will immediately have difficulties thereafter. Unless we reduce the size of our army and navy by one-third, we won't make it...They [...] should have prepared for something like this a long time ago. It's unacceptable for them to be making a commotion about it now." [...] The American historian Herbert Bix wrote it was typical of the Emperor to criticize his generals and admirals for not anticipating the American move and preparing for it, instead of considering ending the war with China that had brought about the cancellation of the 1911 treaty.|$|E

30|$|Two {{mechanisms}} {{can account}} for the late season increase in seed species richness observed at the Tyee Fire. First, the late season increase in richness in high severity fire sites {{may be associated with}} greater micro-site habitat variability, perhaps from greater sun penetration and soil drying. If other microsites of these same high severity patches <b>were</b> more mesic (<b>an</b> intuitive assumption given the number of fallen trees providing shade and moist micro-sites), the effect <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> number of available habitats favoring a late maturing species. The Tyee low severity fire patches may lack these dry micro-sites and therefore have lower species richness. The second mechanism is the open canopy condition of the high severity burn sites. A relatively open canopy in these patches might allow more seed influx than more densely forested sites. This has implications for weed spread after high severity fires. Seed richness was higher in the more severely burned patches and this difference suggests seed dispersal and colonization are influenced by the degree of canopy removal.|$|R

One hundred seventeen middle school students, in five life science classes, participated in pre-unit and post-unit surveys (Appendix A). Three classes in the experimental group received instruction supplemented with picture books. Two classes in the comparison group received traditional instruction, without the use of picture books. The questions that were asked were about what types of learning and classroom activities they prefer, what makes learning fun for them, and how they think they learn best. Of the classes in the experimental group, picture books improved by one point (ranked one point higher) from pre-to postsurvey. The researcher included one question on the pre-and post-surveys that asked about visual, kinesthetic, and auditory learners. Quantitative analysis suggested that picture books may meet the needs of all three learning modalities, and <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> benefit to auditory learners.
