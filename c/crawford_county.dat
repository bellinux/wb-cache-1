5|$|M-18 is {{maintained}} by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like all other state trunkline highways. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the traffic volumes along the roads under its jurisdiction using a measurement called annual average daily traffic (AADT). This is a metric for the level of traffic along a roadway segment for any average day of the year. In 2009, MDOT calculated that 14,017vehicles used the section of M-18 along the M-61 concurrency, the highest traffic levels along M-18. The lowest AADT was found along the highway in <b>Crawford</b> <b>County</b> in the 2009 surveys. Commercial traffic varied between the 50trucks daily in <b>Crawford</b> <b>County</b> and the 214trucks a day north of Gladwin. No section of M-18 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E

The main attractions are the historic sites of Corydon, the county's golf courses, the Horseshoe Riverboat Casino and Hotel, and the area's two famous caves: Squire Boone Caverns near Mauckport and Wyandotte Caves in adjoining <b>Crawford</b> <b>County.</b> The casino is the county's single {{largest source of}} tax revenue and produced $23.5 million in tax revenue during 2007.|$|E
5|$|K-3 first {{appears on}} the 1932 state highway map. At that time, the route was almost {{completely}} gravel; only the concurrency with US-54 was paved. By 1950, the portion of K-3 in <b>Crawford</b> <b>County</b> had been paved. The portion of the route from the CrawfordBourbon county line to {{the west end of}} the concurrency with K-39 was paved in 1953, and the remainder of the road was paved by 1958. No significant changes have been made to the route since then.|$|E

5|$|The first {{division}} of the county occurred in 1814 when the northern portion of the county was separated to become Washington County. The county was again divided in 1818 with {{the western part of}} the county being separated to become <b>Crawford</b> <b>County.</b> A third division occurred in 1819 when Floyd County was created out of the eastern part of the county. Harrison County's eastern border has had minor adjustments through land transactions with Floyd County; the last change occurred in 1968.|$|E
5|$|The {{railroad}} reached Harrison County in 1869. A {{line was}} completed across the northern half of county in 1874 running from Floyd County connecting Crandall and then continuing west into <b>Crawford</b> <b>County.</b> A southward extension connecting Corydon to Crandall {{was completed in}} 1882. A train wreck killed three in 1902. The southern extension connecting Corydon was purchased by the Corydon Scenic Railroad Company in 1989 and operated as a tourist attraction until 2003 when it was closed because of financial difficulties, ending passenger service in the county.|$|E

The Ohio River defines the county's southern border; across the river lies the state of Kentucky and the city of Louisville. The Blue River runs along the county's western border. Six counties are adjacent to Harrison County. Three are in Indiana: Washington County to the north, Floyd County to the east, and <b>Crawford</b> <b>County</b> to the west. The other three are in Kentucky: Jefferson County and Hardin County are to the southeast and Meade County is to the south.|$|E
5|$|North of this freeway interchange, M-18 is {{also the}} route of Business Loop I-75 (BL I-75). The {{combined}} BL I-75/M-18 runs north near the Roscommon Conservation Airport and turns northeasterly into town. In the middle of Roscommon, BL I-75 turns northwest along Old 76 Road, and M-18 continues northeasterly across a line of the Lake State Railway. The highway continues independently to the northwest over the South Branch of the Au Sable River and out of town. It then turns due east along the Roscommon–Crawford county line. This section of the county line also forms the southern boundary of the Huron National Forest. M-18 curves to the northeast off the county line into the national forest territory where it meets F-97 for a second time. At this junction, F-97 merges with M-18 and the two roads run due north to a junction with M-72 west of Luzerne. At this intersection, F-97 continues north and M-18 terminates in rural <b>Crawford</b> <b>County.</b>|$|E
5|$|M-55/M-76 ran west into Roscommon County along West Branch Road. The two {{highways}} separated at a junction with St. Helen Road where M-76 turned due {{north toward}} St. Helen. South of town, the highway met county road F-97 at a junction with Artesia Beach Road. The two roads ran concurrently into town {{along the east}} end of Lake St. Helen. Near the airport in town, M-76 turned back northwesterly along Washington Street, parting from F-97 in the process. The highway ran along the northeastern shore of Lake St. Helen and near Mud Lake as it continued toward Roscommon. As it entered that town, the trunkline passed the Roscommon Conservation Airport and followed Elm Street on a northwest track through the middle of the village. M-18 joined M-76 in the center of town, and the two turned parallel to the Roscommon–Crawford county line on Federal Highway. Northeast of Higgins Lake, the highway transitioned to a freeway; that freeway ran northwest into <b>Crawford</b> <b>County.</b> M-18/M-76 terminated at a junction south of Grayling with US27. This partial interchange marked the point where I-75 resumed its course north through the state. Traffic could not directly access southbound US27 from northbound M-76 and northbound US27 could not access southbound M-76.|$|E
