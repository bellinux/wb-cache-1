40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the use of}} <b>communication</b> <b>boards</b> by seven nonspeaking, nonambulatory, severely mentally retarded students (all functioning at an early preoperational level cognitively) interacting with their teachers in a residential classroom setting. The authors present a method by which the spontaneous use of <b>communication</b> <b>boards</b> can be assessed as to actual functionality in meeting the students 2 ̆ 7 communicative needs. The students 2 ̆ 7 reliance on and success with their <b>communication</b> <b>boards</b> were analyzed relative to nonboard modes (e. g., gestures and vocalizations). Analysis of videotaped nonspeaking student-teacher interactions revealed that these students rarely used their <b>communication</b> <b>boards</b> despite their severe inability to convey messages by any other means. Use of the <b>communication</b> <b>boards</b> rather than alternate modes neither increased the likelihood of success nor decreased the ambiguity of student messages. <b>Communication</b> <b>boards</b> thus appeared to add little to the communicative competence of these students in interacting with their teachers. These findings are {{discussed in terms of}} the need to assess nonspeaking persons 2 ̆ 7 use of augmentative systems outside the speech-language pathology setting, in order to begin to identify, explain, and treat communication breakdowns arising from interactions between nonspeaking persons and those with whom they attempt to interact in their daily living experiences...|$|R

40|$|When {{children}} with severe phonological disorders engage in communication interactions, {{the severity of}} their phonological disorders interferes with the successful transmission of their communication message. The severity of the phonological disorders greatly compromises the children 2 ̆ 7 s ability to successfully engage in communication interactions. ^ Sixteen children from 3 years, 5 months to 7 years, 5 months of age met the initial selection criteria of having a severe phonological disorder and/or suspected DAS, in addition to showing limited gains during intervention. Further standardized and descriptive assessments were conducted associated with phonological proficiency, intelligibility, and cognition. The study investigated what effect the introduction of AAC <b>communication</b> <b>boards,</b> had on {{the quality and quantity}} of the children 2 ̆ 7 s communication interactions. ^ The design of the study was an ABA design consisting of three phases. Pre-treatment condition (no context-specific <b>communication</b> <b>boards</b> available); Treatment condition (context-specific <b>communication</b> <b>boards</b> available during the activities); and Post-treatment condition (no context-specific <b>communication</b> <b>boards</b> available). Children engaged in age appropriate play activities with the investigator. All phases of the study were videotaped for a total of 25 minutes, and later analyzed. Videotape time codes allowed the investigator to analyze the childrens 2 ̆ 7 communicative behaviors for the level and type of comprehensible behaviors across different modalities, contingent communication behaviors, communication acts, communication breakdown repairs, Mean Length of Utterance (MLU), and Type-Token Ratio (TTR). ^ Results showed that the introduction of AAC had positive effects on {{the quality and quantity of}} communication interactions of {{children with}} severe phonological disorders. The introduction of AAC allowed the children to be more comprehensible, and successful in their communication repairs. Children with the most severe speech disorders used AAC more frequently. The investigator hopes that the empirical data from this study provides the rationale for SLPs to introduce AAC as a means of supporting the speech, communication interaction and language needs, rather than only addressing the issue of improving phonological proficiency. ...|$|R
500|$|Depending {{on their}} {{language}} and cognitive skills, those with aphasia may use AAC interventions such as communication and memory books, drawing, photography, written words, speech generating devices and keyboards. Visual scene displays {{have been used}} on communication devices with adults who have chronic, severe aphasia; these feature photos of people, places or events that are meaningful to the individual and facilitative of communicative interaction.

In the early years, AAC was primarily used with laryngectomy and glossectomy cases, and later with individuals with cerebral palsy and aphasia. It was typically only employed after traditional speech therapy had failed, as many felt hesitant to provide non-speech intervention to those who might be able to learn to speak. Individuals with intellectual impairment were not provided with AAC support because it was believed that they did not possess the prerequisite skills for AAC. The main systems used were manual signs, communication boards and Morse code, though in the early 1960s, an electric communication device in the form of a sip-and-puff typewriter controller named the Patient Operated Selector Mechanism (POSM or POSSUM) was developed in the United Kingdom.|$|E

50|$|This act begins {{once more}} in the Manhattan apartment. Nic and Eileen sit in the living room. The {{audience}} learns that Brian left Nic at the airport security check {{when she began to}} have second thoughts about running away with him and abandoning her son. It is also revealed that Eileen had fallen into a drug-induced sleep at her own gate and missed her flight to London. Police found them both and they were quickly arrested for child abandonment. Nic has luckily been granted shared custody of her son. However, Eileen is likely to lose Emily and is having to pack up her things which will be picked up by social workers as Emily is going into foster care. As the two women reflect on their shared experiences the image of Brian (wherever he is in the world) appears and he expresses his true hatred for Emily and everything she represents to him. Blanka then returns, having spent all of the money that Brian originally paid her to not go to the police. In an emotional outburst, she convinces Eileen to listen to some of Emily's poems which is the last thing the audience hears as the lights go out. They hear a robotic <b>communication</b> <b>board</b> voice slowly becoming the voice of a little girl.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background: Some {{patients}} receiving mechanical ventilation experience an intensified need to communicate while {{their ability to}} do so is compromised as the endotracheal tube prevents speech. Although the use of a <b>communication</b> <b>board</b> to enhance communication with such patients has been suggested, few descriptive or empirical studies have addressed the content and format of these devices or of patients ’ perspectives on decreasing frustration with communication. Objectives: The objectives of this study were: (1) to identify the perceived level of frustration of {{patients receiving}} mechanical ventilation while they attempt to communicate; (2) to determine patients ’ perceived level of frustration if a <b>communication</b> <b>board</b> had been used; and (3) to describe patients ’ perceptions of the appropriate content and format of a <b>communication</b> <b>board.</b> Methods: Twenty-nine critically ill patients who were extubated within the past 72 hours were included in this descriptive study.
