5|$|Before World War I, {{the city}} had a {{population}} that was 42% ethnic German, 41% Hungarian and 15% Slovak (1910 census). After World War I {{and the formation of}} <b>Czechoslovakia</b> on October 28, 1918, the city was incorporated into the new state despite its representatives' reluctance. The dominant Hungarian and German population tried to prevent annexation of the city to <b>Czechoslovakia</b> and declared it a free city. However, the Czechoslovak Legions occupied the city on January 1, 1919, and made it part of <b>Czechoslovakia.</b> The city became the seat of Slovakia's political organs and organizations and became Slovakia's capital on 4 February. On February 12, 1919 the German and Hungarian population started a protest against the Czechoslovak occupation, but the Czechoslovak Legions opened fire on the unarmed demonstrators.|$|E
5|$|During the {{communist}} era, rapid urbanization {{and growth of}} heavy industry occurred. Whole villages in the coal mining areas were destroyed by the mining activity.

5|$|For UEFA Euro 1976, England {{were drawn}} {{in a tough}} {{qualification}} group including <b>Czechoslovakia,</b> Portugal and Cyprus, with only the winner progressing to the finals. England began the campaign well with a 3–0 victory over <b>Czechoslovakia</b> at Wembley, Mick Channon and Colin Bell scoring the goals. However a 0–0 home draw with Portugal was a minor setback, despite Malcolm Macdonald scoring all the goals in a 5–0 win over Cyprus following a morale boosting 2–0 friendly win over 1974 FIFA World Cup champions West Germany. Kevin Keegan scored the only goal of the game at the Tsirion Stadium to secure maximum points in Cyprus, and leave England in a strong position going into the two tough final group games in <b>Czechoslovakia</b> and Portugal. Though only drawing with Wales and Northern Ireland, a 5–1 victory over Scotland secured England the 1974–75 British Home Championship title and left England in confident mood for the crucial qualifying games. However, despite Channon opening the scoring they fell to a 2–1 defeat to the Czechoslovakians in Bratislava after playing with what was for Revie uncharacteristic attacking tactics. A 1–1 draw in Lisbon then allowed <b>Czechoslovakia</b> to clinch the group with a win over Cyprus. <b>Czechoslovakia</b> {{then went on to}} win the whole tournament. Revie was criticised for his constant changing of players during the qualifying group, particularly his decision to drop captains Emlyn Hughes and Alan Ball from his squad entirely, his mistrust of flair players like Charlie George and Alan Hudson, and his willingness to play players out of position also drew criticism.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, Winton {{cancelled}} {{a trip to}} a Swiss {{holiday resort}} to go to Prague, having heard of a growing refugee crisis resulting from the German occupation of <b>Czechoslovakia</b> from a friend. His friend was working in the British embassy for the British Committee for Refugees from <b>Czechoslovakia,</b> which was already working to help adults escape from <b>Czechoslovakia.</b> When Winton learned that refugee children could not leave unless accompanied, he decided to arrange their evacuation to Britain. While the Winton evacuations later became known by the collective label of the children's Kindertransports, which were officially being organised elsewhere in other countries, no official Kindertransports had been arranged in Prague at that time.|$|E
