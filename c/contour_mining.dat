40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. ERTS- 1 imagery has identified when reclamation has proved successful, when little lateral extension {{has occurred in}} the strip mine, when water has filled an impoundment (4 - 5 acres), and detected narrow <b>contour</b> <b>mines.</b> It has been proven that the CCT contains more information than the imagery received from NASA. A stream is visible in the band 7 digital printout that is not visible in the imagery. Also narrow bodies of water between the high wall and spoils bank and small impoundments (2 - 3 acres) are observed in the digital printout and not in the imagery. Disruption maps (water and bare earth within the mined area) can be made by statistically processing the CCT (decision imagery) or mapping the digital printout with a Bendix digitizer. Reclamation maps will be produced in the near future through decision imagery. There seems little doubt that the mapping of present stripping and the monitoring of the strip mine cycle for changes are practical. Disruption mapping is now an operational capability...|$|R

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Mined land reclamation analysis procedures developed within the Indiana {{portion of the}} Illinois Coal Basin were independently tested in Ohio utilizing 1 : 80, 000 scale enlargements of ERTS- 1 image 1029 - 15361 - 7 (dated August 21, 1972). An area in Belmont County was selected for analysis due to the extensive surface mining and the different degrees of reclamation occurring in this area. <b>Contour</b> <b>mining</b> in this area provided the opportunity to extend techniques developed for analysis of relatively flat mining areas in Indiana to areas of rolling topography in Ohio. The analysts had no previous experience in the area. Field investigations largely confirmed office analysis results although in a few areas estimates of vegetation percentages {{were found to be}} too high. In one area this error approximated 25 %. These results suggest that systematic ERTS- 1 analysis in combination with selective field sampling can provide reliable vegetation percentage estimates in excess of 25 % accuracy with minimum equipment investment and training. The utility of ERTS- 1 for practical and reasonably reliable update of mined lands information for groups with budget limitations is suggested. Many states can benefit from low cost updates using ERTS- 1 imagery from public sources...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of geomorphic principles to land reclamation after surface mining {{has been reported}} in the literature since the mid- 1990 s, mostly from Australia, Canada and the USA. This paper discusses the reclamation problems of <b>contour</b> <b>mining</b> and quarries on slopes, where steep gradients are prone to both mass movement and water erosion. To address these problems simultaneously, a geomorphic model for reclaiming surface mined slopes is described. Called the ‘highwall–trench– concave slope’ model, it was fi rst applied in the 1995 reclamation of a quarry on a slope (La Revilla) in Central Spain. The geomorphic model does not reproduce the original topography, but has two very different sectors and objectives: (i) the highwall–trench sector allows the former quarry face to evolve naturally by erosion, accommodating fallen debris by means of a trench constructed at the toe of the highwall; (ii) the concave-slope base sector, mimicking the landforms of the surrounding undisturbed landscape, promotes soil formation and the establishment of self-sustaining, functional ecosystems in the area protected from sedimentation by the trench. The model improves upon simple topographic reconstruction, because it rebuilds the surfi cial geology architecture and facilitates re-establishment of equilibrium slopes through the management and control of geomorphic processes. Thirteen years of monitoring of the geomorphic and edaphic evolution of La Revilla reclaimed quarry confi rms that the area is functioning as intended: the highwall is backwasting and material is accumulating at the trench, permitting the recovery of soils and vegetation on the concave slope. However, the trench is fi lling faster than planned, which may lead to run-off and sedimentation on the concave slope once the trench is full. The lesson learned for other scenarios is that the model works well in a twodimensional scheme, but requires a three-dimensional drainage management, breaking the reclaimed area into several watersheds with stream channels...|$|E
25|$|The {{limitations}} of <b>contour</b> strip <b>mining</b> are {{both economic and}} technical. When the operation reaches a predetermined stripping ratio (tons of overburden/tons of coal), it is not profitable to continue. Depending on the equipment available, {{it may not be}} technically feasible to exceed a certain height of highwall. At this point, it is possible to produce more coal with the augering method in which spiral drills bore tunnels into a highwall laterally from the bench to extract coal without removing the overburden.|$|R

In areas with rolling or steep terrain with a coal seam occurring {{near the top}} of a ridge or hill, the entire top is removed in a series of parallel cuts. Overburden isdeposited in nearby valleys and hollows. This method usually leaves ridge and hill tops as flattened plateaus. The process is highly controversial for the drastic changes in topography, the practice ofcreating head-of-hollow-fills, or filling in valleys with mining debris, and for covering streams and disrupting ecosystems.|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} classifications during both raw and {{transformed}} MSS and TM data sets from 4 September 1982 were performed for the Logan County, West Virginia study area. The object {{was to compare}} the utility of TM and MSS data for delineating small, irregular ground features, particularly surface mines, and also to test data reduction/transformation techniques (band selection, canonical analysis, and principal components) {{in relation to a}} traditional means of unsupervised classification. Statistical results demonstrate that, on the average, the TM classifications yielded an overall. 53 factor of improvement relative to the MSS classifications. When the accuracies for only three minor (in terms of areal extent) land use categories are examined, the factor of improvement for TM over MSS increases to 1. 48; i. e., the TM is nearly one and one-half times better than the MSS for delineating small and irregular ground features such as <b>contour</b> strip <b>mines...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this is paper is to review {{the current state of}} knowledge and practice in highwall mining (HWM). HWM has become a widely-applied method in surface mining, commonly used alone or in conjunction with contour or slot mining. It provides 800 -feet to 1, 200 -feet of additional recovery when the economic stripping ratio is reached in <b>contour</b> <b>mining</b> or in slot mining when surface access to a reserve is limited. A significant attribute of the highwall miner is its versatility. HWM has been used successfully to mine abandoned pre-reclamation law highwalls, points or ridges uneconomic to mine by underground or other surface methods, outcrop barriers left adjacent to underground mines, separate benches of the same seam where the parting thickness or quality differences between benches render complete extraction uneconomic, previously augered areas containing otherwise inaccessible additional reserves and close or widely spaced multiple seams. The theory and design methods to assess roof, pillar, and floor stability are presented followed by three case histories. Simple design charts for sizing HWM web and barrier pillars are also presented. A recommended web pillar width may be obtained from the design charts given the overburden depth, the HWM cut width, and the mining height. Given the depth and panel width for a set of HWM cuts, another set of charts gives a suggested barrier pillar width. The case histories, from Northern and Southern Appalachia are used to illustrate the application of rock mechanics to quantify the stability of the highwall, roof, web pillars, and floor. The case histories involve 1) mining through a previously augered highwall, 2) mining under back-stacked spoil and 3) selective mining of closely spaced benches of the same seam. Because each site is unique, the appropriate pre-mining geotechnical analyses range from the calculation of roof, web pillar, and floor bearing capacity stability factors to detailed numerical modeling of the auger and underground mine workings. When operating in the vicinity of existing underground mine or auger workings, the determination of ground deformation and strains resulting from highwall mining is a necessary facet of a ground control investigation...|$|E
40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{conducted}} {{a series of}} delayed blasting experiments at a West Virginia <b>contour</b> coal <b>mine</b> that resulted in smoother highwalls. The 17; were smoother due to reduced overbreak and inherently safer A, to reduced likelihood of rockfall. Reduced overbreak was accomplished by an increase in the highwall hole delays, which changed the effective delay pattern geometry and the direction of burden movement. The blast delays in the highwall holes were 50 to 100 ms longer than the mine's nominal design pattern (flat V, 17 - by 42 -ms surface delays, 200 -ms in-the-hole delay). The burden movement was effectively changed from a 45 * angle to 90 * with respect to the highwall. The results of the blast delay changes were evaluated using terrestrial photogrammetry to generate vertical profiles at regular intervals. This evaluation showed that delay changes produced generally smoother vertical profiles...|$|R
40|$|The largest <b>contour</b> strip <b>mining</b> {{operations}} in western Maryland and West Virginia are {{located within the}} Georges Creek and the Upper Potomac Basins. These two coal basins lie within the Georges Creek (Wellersburg) syncline. The disturbed strip mine areas were delineated with the surrounding geological and vegetation features using ERTS- 1 data in both analog (imagery) and digital form. The two digital systems used were: (1) the ERTS-Analysis system, a point-by-point digital analysis of spectral signatures based on known spectral values, and (2) the LARS Automatic Data Processing System. The digital techniques being developed will later be incorporated into a data base for land use planning. These two systems aided in efforts {{to determine the extent}} and state of strip mining in this region. Aircraft data, ground verification information, and geological field studies also aided in the application of ERTS- 1 imagery to perform an integrated analysis that assessed the adverse effects of strip mining. The results indicated that ERTS can both monitor and map the extent of strip mining to determine immediately the acreage affected and indicate where future reclamation and revegetation may be necessary...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Thousands of depressional {{wetlands}} accidentally {{formed as}} a result of pre- 1977 <b>contour</b> coal <b>mining</b> in the Appalachian Mountains. Eleven 20 -yr old sites were found in a watershed that did not receive acid mine drainage. The {{purpose of this study was}} to quantify and model above- and below-ground plant biomass in these created wetlands and to evaluate functional development. Sampling was stratified by weighted average of two plant communities, which corresponded to shallower and deeper water levels, facul-tative wetland and obligate wetland communities, respec-tively. In 1994, peak above-ground biomass averaged 473. 7 g m− 2 in the facultative wetland community and 409. 5 g m− 2 in the obligate wetland community. Scirpus cyperinus exhibited the highest peak above-ground biomass (51. 8 % of total biomass) and Typha latifolia ranked second. Canonical correspondence analysis detected positive effects of longer soil exposure to the atmosphere and greater sediment depth on above-ground biomass at the site (wetland ecosystem) level. Within communities, forward stepwise regression identified positive association of above-ground biomass with water soluble reactive P, water soluble NH 3, decomposition rate over 507 d, live S. cyperinus tissue P content, and sediment depth. When these results are combined with prior studies conducted at the same 20 -yr old sites, it appears that both structural and functional development has been arrested at a somewhat immature state resulting primarily from soil and hydrologic factors...|$|R

40|$|In many African countries, {{women make}} up {{large parts of the}} {{workforce}} in artisanal and small-scale mining communities (ASM). They carry out activities ranging from providing tertiary services (selling drinks, food, and sex) to unearthing gold ores and participating in the gold trade. While women remained largely invisible to academics, NGOs and states in the past, recent feminist publications and development programmes have increased the visibility of women and gender in mining (e. g. ‘the Feminisation of mining’, Lahiri-Dutt, 2015). Many aid programmes, however, often lump together women and mining into one homogenising category, highlighting women’s vulnerability. Rather than putting victimcy ahead of agency and contributing to an NGO-isation of the mining discourse whereby “regulation” is put forward as a panacea to gender inequality (regulation of both the public and private sphere), this paper highlights how female miners take advantage of the blurred <b>contours</b> of the <b>mining</b> space to manage the unpredictable, varied and potentially dangerous conditions of everyday life in the mine. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The open-pit mining {{problem is}} to {{determine}} the <b>contours</b> of a <b>mine,</b> based on economic data and engineering feasibility requirements in order to yield maximumpossible net income.

The industry is experiencing computational difficulties in solving the problem. Yet, the problem is known to be equivalent to the minimum cut or maximum flow problem.

40|$|Abstract. Chengmenshan {{open pit}} has been {{constructed}} {{to be the}} biggest copper pit in China. The slope designed with empirical rock mass rating and engineering analogy needs reinvestigation and evaluation for its overall stability. With help of SURPAC, the topographic <b>contour</b> of the <b>mine</b> was converted into surface model. Then the geological information of the mine was embedded into the numerical solid model by NURBS treatment of the core loggings. Through overall stability analysis with MIDAS, it was found that there was no obvious failure in the pit with the current design. But the major principal stress at the north especially the north-east corner of the pit tended to be high, so the width of the bench below the high stress region is suggested to be widened for possible collapse in this region. And field observation should be carried out in the region. Once evident slip or collapse happens, anchor and netting structures should be used. At the same time, high shear stress zones were revealed at the south-east of the outside limit of the pit. More planting is suggested to avoid soil creep or even landslides in heavy rain...|$|R
40|$|Three spoil slope slides, {{two in the}} Appalachian Plateau region (Pennsylvania and West Virginia) and {{the third}} in the Interior Coal Province (Southwestern Indiana) were studied to {{determine}} types and causes of slope instability. The two slides in the Appalachian plateau region were associated with <b>contour</b> strip <b>mining,</b> whereas the Indiana site was associated with areal strip mining. ^ The objectives were: (1) To examine in geological detail {{the nature of the}} spoil piles under study and the materials from which they were derived. (2) To identify types of spoil stability problems and the factors that contribute to these problems. (3) To determine the relationships if any between the overburden and foundation materials, their properties and the nature of failure. (4) To provide guidelines which suggest locations with a high probability for slope instability during mining and supply recommended procedures to reduce these effects. ^ Geologic, geomorphologic, hydrologic, material and man-induced factors were evaluated to determine their influences on the slides. ^ Stability analyses were performed to determine failure modes of the spoil slope in each site and influence of input parameters on the stability of the slopes. Conclusions: (1) That the spoil stability problems in the Appalachian region may have a primary cause [...] the presence of expandable clays. These clays absorb much water and swell, thus exerting an upward pressure that may reduce shear resistance within the soil or rock that contains them. (2) That water was usually the activating agent for the slide activity. (3) That the interaction of geomorphologic, hydrologic and man-induced factors are collectively responsible for the entry and accumulation of water within the sliding spoil. (4) That the spoil slide in Pennsylvania was basically an outslope foundation failure whereas that in West Virginia was a spoil outslope failure. (5) That the spoil slope angle presently adopted in the southern Indiana mine site will lead to occasional slope failures in areas where the unconsolidated overburden is very thick and consists essentially of low strength clay. ^ Corrective measures are suggested to improve stability of spoil piles in the areas. Based on the study findings a site evaluation chart is proposed to aid mine operators in identifying problem areas. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of Nash bargaining solution to profit division in negotiation between opencast lignite mine and power plant has been discussed. Different proposals of status quo point usage {{and ways of}} its determination for profit sharing both in strategic and tactical/operational negotiation have been presented. The novel approach {{is the creation of}} lignite price <b>contours</b> on the <b>mine</b> and power plant profit distribution chart. It shows the inherent contradiction between individual and group rationality in bilateral monopoly (BM) and the reduction of incentive to opportunism together with the increase of lignite price. The opportunism due to asymmetry of information and possession of dominant strategy of mine (optimization of ultimate pit) creates a real threat to cooperation between both sides of BM. The full confidence in joint profit maximization and full control of accepted profit sharing without increase of transactional costs is possible only in vertically integrated energy producer offering equal access to information for both sides. As it was shown in [4] such solution does not create any threat for energy market efficiency – on the contrary it can allow on better level of deposit recovery through excavation of the greater ultimate pit. The interesting proposal is the treatment of pit optimization as a real option of mine size change. Presented methods, tools and solutions should help both firms in real negotiation in finding their strategic positions and avoiding potential threats. But eventually from negotiating sides it depends if they will choose the cooperation or competition, rational arguments or rational threats, maximization of joint profits or only their own. ...|$|R
