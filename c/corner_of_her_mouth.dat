60|$|She shrugged her shoulders, whilst a {{slightly}} contemptuous curl {{appeared at the}} <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'That fiend!' Mr. Darling would cry, and Nana's bark was {{the echo}} of it, but Mrs. Darling never upbraided Peter; there was {{something}} in the right-hand <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> that wanted her not to call Peter names.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, will you?" [...] she said, {{taking away}} her hand. [...] "That would be delightful. But {{what would become}} of your folks?" [...] She caught a <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> with her teeth, as if the word had slipped out.|$|E
60|$|Her eyebrows were gently raised, the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> quivered, <b>her</b> eyes fell.|$|R
60|$|Eleanor {{said nothing}} further on the subject, but the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> rearranged themselves.|$|R
60|$|She {{gave him}} a quick look, and a smile quivered at the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Madame Merle bent {{her head}} on one side a little, protestingly, and smiled at the left <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> [...] "You've heard, yes. But you must {{remember}} that I've not, in Naples. I hoped to find him here {{and to be able}} to congratulate Pansy." ...|$|E
60|$|He liked Mrs. Saulisbury at once, though {{naturally}} prejudiced against her. She {{had evidently}} {{been a very}} handsome woman, but some concealed pain had made her face thin and drawn, and one <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> was set in a slight fold as if by a touch of paralysis. Her profile was still very beautiful, and her voice {{was that of a}} highly cultivated American.|$|E
60|$|When {{the train}} {{pulled out of}} the station into the clearer light, she turned her face from him toward the forward window, and the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> which her half-averted profile gave him, had a kind of piteous droop which smote him to keener regret. Once it lifted in an upward curve, and a gay light came into the corner of her eye; then the mouth drooped again, and the light went out.|$|E
60|$|She sighed as {{she took}} it, and a wistful smile {{invested}} the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|R
60|$|Celia's rare tears had {{got into}} her eyes, and the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> were agitated.|$|R
60|$|Virginia did not deign {{a direct}} reply to this, save by the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|R
60|$|As {{he passed}} out through the breakfast-room, Lily was sitting by the window with her letter in her lap, and a happy smile on her lips. When he came back she {{happened}} to be seated in the same place; she still had a letter in her lap, but she was smiling no longer; her face was turned from him as he entered, and he imagined a wistful droop in that <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> which showed on her profile.|$|E
60|$|The {{new arrival}} {{stopped and looked}} out over the footlights, not in the pained manner of the man in the bowler hat, but with the sort of genial indulgence of one who has come to a {{juvenile}} party to amuse the children. She was a square, wholesome, good-humoured looking girl with a serious face, the gravity of which was contradicted by the faint smile that seemed to lurk about the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> She was certainly not pretty, and Sally, watching her with keen interest, was surprised that Fillmore had had the sense to disregard surface homeliness and recognize her charm. Deep down in Fillmore, Sally decided, there must lurk an unsuspected vein of intelligence.|$|E
6000|$|However, in four days' {{time there}} was a very comical twinkle in his eye, as he {{informed}} her that the new number of the [...] "Traveller" [...] was in no favour at the Homestead, [...] "there was such a want of original thought in it." [...] Ermine felt her imprudence in having risked the betrayal, but all she did was to look at him with her full, steady eyes, and a little twist in each <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> as she said, [...] "Indeed! Then we had better enliven it with the recollections of a military secretary," [...] and he was both convinced of what he guessed, and also that she did not think it right to tell him; [...] "But," [...] he said, [...] "there is something in that girl, I perceive, Ermine; she does think for herself, and if she were not so dreadfully earnest that she can't smile, she would be the best company of any of the party." ...|$|E
60|$|Eva {{took it and}} smiled, {{though there}} was still a nervous twiching about the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mary cast {{down her}} eyes, and the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> twitched {{as if with}} a slight smile.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. McCaskey arose heavily, {{and went}} toward the dish closet, with the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> drawn down.|$|R
60|$|The mouth seemed formed less {{to speak}} than to quiver, less to quiver than to kiss. Some might have added, less to kiss than to curl. Viewed sideways, the closing-line {{of her lips}} formed, with almost {{geometric}} precision, the curve so {{well known in the}} arts of design as the cima-recta, or ogee. The sight of such a flexible bend as that on grim Egdon was quite an apparition. It was felt at once that the mouth did not come over from Sleswig with a band of Saxon pirates whose lips met like the two halves of a muffin. One had fancied that such lip-curves were mostly lurking underground in the South as fragments of forgotten marbles. So fine were the lines of her lips that, though full, each <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> was as clearly cut as the point of a spear. This keenness of corner was only blunted when she was given over to sudden fits of gloom, one of the phases of the night-side of sentiment which she knew too well for her years.|$|E
60|$|On that eventful Thursday week Mrs. Darling {{was in the}} night-nursery {{awaiting}} George's return home: a very sad-eyed woman. Now {{that we look at}} her {{closely and}} remember the gaiety of her in the old days, all gone now just because she has lost her babes, I find I won't be able to say nasty things about her after all. If she was too fond of her rubbishy children she couldn't help it. Look at her in her chair, where she has fallen asleep. The <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> where one looks first, is almost withered up. Her hand moves restlessly on her breast as if she had a pain there. Some like Peter best and some like Wendy best, but I like her best. Suppose, to make her happy, we whisper to her in her sleep that the brats are coming back. They are really within two miles of the window now, and flying strong, but all we need whisper is that they are on the way. Let's.|$|E
60|$|Naturally my mind worried {{itself with}} this puzzle of a being with two {{distinct}} expressions, one strange to me, the other familiar, {{and it went}} on worrying me all that day until I could stand it no longer, and {{to get rid of}} the matter, I set up the theory (which didn't quite convince me) that the momentary expression I had seen was like an expression in some one I had known in the far past. But after dismissing the subject in that way, the subconscious mind was still no doubt working at it, for two days later it all at once flashed into my mind that my mysterious young lady was no other than the little Lillian I had known so well eight years before! She was ten years old when I first knew her, and I was quite intimately acquainted with her for a little over a year, and greatly admired her for her beauty and charm, especially when she smiled and that dimple flew about the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> like a twilight moth vaguely fluttering at the rim of a red flower. But alas! her charm was waning: she was surrounded by relations who adored her, and was intensely self-conscious, so that when after a year her people moved to a new district, I was not sorry to break the connection, and to forget all about her.|$|E
60|$|She halted {{and half}} turned, and I thought I saw a slight droop at the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{thrust his}} hand into his pocket, but Mrs. Foulton drew back. The <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> were drawn tightly together.|$|R
60|$|At this {{there was}} a quick flash in her eyes, and the first tremblings of a smile at the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|R
60|$|It {{has been}} said that except for one lapse his life had been austere, but this is not to assert that he had no {{capacity}} for passion. The contrary was the case. That flame which had been so jealously guarded smouldered deep within him--a smothered fire with but little air to feed on. The moment his spirit was touched by the spirit of this woman, it had flared up. She was the incarnation of all that he desired. Her hair, her eyes, her form; the tiny tuck or dimple at the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> just where a child places its finger; her way of moving, a sort of unconscious swaying or yielding to the air; the tone in her voice, which seemed to come not so much from happiness of her own as from an innate wish to make others happy; and that natural, if not robust, intelligence, which belongs to the very sympathetic, and is rarely found in women of great ambitions or enthusiasms--all these things had twined themselves round his heart. He not only dreamed of her, and wanted her; he believed in her. She filled his thoughts as one who could never do wrong; as one who, though a wife would remain a mistress, and though a mistress, would always be the companion of his spirit.|$|E
6000|$|There {{was nothing}} {{individually}} remarkable about Miss Silvester, {{seen in a}} state of repose. She was of the average height. She was as well made as most women. In hair and complexion she was neither light nor dark, but provokingly neutral just between the two. Worse even than this, there were positive defects in her face, which it was impossible to deny. A nervous contraction at one <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> drew up the lips out of the symmetrically right line, when, they moved. A nervous uncertainty in the eye on the same side narrowly escaped presenting the deformity of a [...] "cast." [...] And yet, with these indisputable drawbacks, here was one of those women--the formidable few--who have the hearts of men and the peace of families at their mercy. She moved--and there was some subtle charm, Sir, in the movement, that made you look back, and suspend your conversation with your friend, and watch her silently while she walked. She sat by you and talked to you--and behold, a sensitive something passed into that little twist {{at the corner of the}} mouth, and into that nervous uncertainty in the soft gray eye, which turned defect into beauty--which enchained your senses--which made your nerves thrill if she touched you by accident, and set your heart beating if you looked at the same book with her, and felt her breath on your face. All this, let it be well understood, only happened if you were a man.|$|E
6000|$|Courtier {{thought of}} Miltoun and his mistress. By what a strange fate had those two been thrown together; {{to what end}} was their love coming? The seeds of grief were already sown, what flowers of darkness, or of tumult would come up? He saw her again as a little, grave, {{considering}} child, with her soft eyes, set wide apart under the dark arched brows, and the little tuck at the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> that used to come when he teased her. And to that gentle creature who would sooner die than force anyone to anything, had been given this queer lover; this aristocrat by birth and nature, with the dried fervent soul, whose every fibre had been bred and trained in and {{to the service of}} Authority; this rejecter of the Unity of Life; this worshipper of an old God! A God that stood, whip in hand, driving men to obedience. A God that even now Courtier could conjure up staring at him from the walls of his nursery. The God his own father had believed in. A God of the Old Testament, knowing neither sympathy nor understanding. Strange that He should be alive still; that there should still be thousands who worshipped Him. Yet, not so very strange, if, as they said, man made God in his own image! Here indeed was a curious mating of what the philosophers would call the will to Love, and the will to Power! ...|$|E
6000|$|Lady Barbara {{could not}} keep the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> quite stiff, but she still said, [...] "You {{do not know what}} you are undertaking." ...|$|R
60|$|Marguerite, with dainty affection, had {{kissed her}} hand to the ladies, as they {{disappeared}} through the door, then a humorous smile began hovering round the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'How {{can you be}} so absurd, Anne?' {{answered}} Elizabeth, {{trying to}} look serious, but the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> relaxing, in spite <b>of</b> <b>her</b> attempts to control her risible muscles.|$|R
6000|$|The Hôtel du Paradis at Cannes {{is a very}} {{pleasant}} and well managed place, where I succeeded in making myself perfectly at home. I gave my full name to the concierge boldly. [...] "Thank Heaven," [...] I thought, [...] "Aikin-Payne will sound to her just as good a label to one's back as Howard or Cholmondely. She won't see the absurdity of the combination." [...] She was a fat Vaudoise Swiss by origin, and she took it without moving a muscle. But she answered me in very tolerable English--me, who thought my Parisian accent unimpeachable! [...] "Vary well, sirr, your lettares shall be sent to your apartments." [...] I saw there was the faintest twinkle of a smile about the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> and I felt that even she, a mere foreigner, a Swiss concierge, perceived at once the incongruity of the two surnames. Incongruity! that's the worst of it! Would that they were incongruous! But it's their fatal and obvious congruity with one another that makes their juxtaposition so ridiculous. Call a man Payne, and I venture to say, though I was to the manner born, and it's me that says it as oughtn't to say it, you couldn't find a neater or more respectable surname in all England: call him plain Aikin, and though that perhaps is less aristocratic, it's redeemed by all the associations of childhood with the earliest literature we imbibed through the innocuous pages of [...] "Evenings at Home:" [...] but join the two together, {{in the order of}} alphabetical precedence, and you get an Aikin-Payne, which is a thing to make a sensitive man, compelled to bear it for a lifetime, turn permanently red like a boiled lobster. My uncle must have done it on purpose, in order to inflict a deadly blow on what he would doubtless have called my confounded self-conceit! ...|$|E
5000|$|Olivia Williams as Mrs. Mary Darling: The matriarch of the Darling {{family who}} is the loveliest lady in Bloomsbury. She {{is said to have}} a kiss that Wendy can never get and that is {{perfectly}} conspicuous on the right hand <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
50|$|Daughter of Carr Benedict and Fiona, and Treize's fraternal twin sister, {{she is the}} {{official}} {{heir to the throne}} of Ikstova. Has a pushy and headstrong personality similar to Allison, which she shows even in front of her own parents. She has a sharp tooth at the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> that stands out when she talks.|$|E
60|$|She faced me, when I {{asked for}} my instructions; and I saw the family frown {{gathering}} over her eyes, and the family temper twitching at the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|R
60|$|Lady Hardy {{sat for a}} moment, {{a picture}} of meek distress. Then, her {{delicate}} eyebrows raised, and the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> drooping, she touched the button of the silver table-bell.|$|R
60|$|Just then Ida {{took her}} hand from her face. There was a dewy look about her eyes, and the last ripples of a happy smile lingered round the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|R
