40|$|HAT), {{also known}} as Sleeping Sickness, {{has been one of}} the most {{important}} human diseases in Africa because of widespread epidemics in the past, its very high level of mortality, and its negative influence on the development of rural populations. Two forms of the disease exist, one chronic form in West and Central Africa caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense (. 95 % of current cases), and an acute form in East and Southern Africa caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (, 5 % of current cases). During the 1960 <b>s</b> <b>HAT</b> was brought under control by the colonial health systems, but unfortunately the rarity of HAT cases led to a decline in awareness of how the disease could return and subse-quently, to a lack of interest in disease surveillance and a decrease in disease control. With this decrease in control and surveillance activities, the disease re-emerged, reaching epidemic proportions by the end of the 20 th century, with the majority of human infections caused by T. b. gambiense. The alarming rise in the number of cases stimulated international efforts to reverse the epidemiological trend and reduce the incidence of the disease, using enhanced surveillance and improved access to diagnosis and treatment in endemic countries [1, 2]. These activities have been complemented by improve-ments in the epidemiological knowledge of the disease and the production of highly detailed disease distribution maps of affected countries [3]. As a result of these outstanding efforts by national sleeping sickness programmes and the support of international organizations led by the World Health Organization (WHO), and involving key pharmaceutical companies and major international donors, remarkable results have been achieved during the past 15 years, with the number of new reported cases falling to 6, 228 in 2013 [4]. This has involved strong collab-oration and coordination of all these stakeholders and the maintenance of a permanent and open dialogue. Based on the advances achieved in the control of the disease, in 2012 the WHO Strategic and Technical Advisory Group for Neglected Tropical Diseases made the decision to target elimination of gambiense HAT as a public health problem by 2020 and to target zero incidence of the diseas...|$|R
40|$|Mutations in the cell-division-cycle genes CDC 46 and CDC 47 were {{originally}} isolated as suppressors of mutations {{in two other}} cell-division-cycle genes (CDC 45 and CDC 54). We found several combinations of mutations in these genes that result in allele-specific suppression and synthetic lethality, confirming that this set of genes forms a group of genetically interacting components. Here, we show that the other genes, like CDC 46, are all involved in an early step of DNA replication, possibly initiation of DNA synthesis. Mutants defective {{in each of the}} four genes exhibit high rates of mitotic chromosome loss and recombination. The mutants appear also to accumulate chromosome damage that can be detected by a novel chromosome electrophoresis assay. Conditional mutants in this group, under fully nonpermissive conditions, show cell-cycle arrest at the beginning of DNA synthesis; under less stringent conditions, some arrest later, in S-phase. The DNA sequence of the CDC 46 gene indicates that the protein is a member of a new family of genes apparently required for DNA initiation, with family members now identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and mouse cells.

In the following report we have characterized the Hat 1 18 complex from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and have examined its role in 19 telomeric silencing. Hat 1 is found associated with the RbAp 46 homologue Mis 16, an 20 essential protein. The Hat 1 complex acetylates lysines 5 and 12 of histone H 4, the sites that 21 are acetylated in newly synthesized H 4 {{in a wide range}} of eukaryotes.

They are soon joined by 4 giant swaying letter <b>S's</b> wearing top <b>hats.</b> Carol ends the song by telling Sammy just how much she'd miss him {{and the way he}} hisses if they ever parted. Carol's song includes lyrics such as: [...] "So..turn on your charm, Sammy/Coil yourself around my arm, Sammy/Sammy the Snake, I'll stake a claim on you".|$|R
