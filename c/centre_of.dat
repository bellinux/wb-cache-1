40|$|In this paper, the {{dynamics}} of migration and commuting into the urban <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> Slovenia in 2000 – 2011 is presented. The influence of the attractiveness <b>of</b> urban <b>centres,</b> the influence <b>of</b> the emissiveness of migration and commuting flows in the origin {{and the influence of}} the distance between origins and destinations on migration and commuting flows into the urban centres in Slovenia were analysed in a spatial interaction model. The dynamics of the parameters were analysed for the period before (2000 - 2007) and in the economic crisis (2008 - 2011). According the Spatial Development Strategy of Slovenia, the urban <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> Slovenia were considered at four levels: national urban <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> international importance, urban <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> national significance, urban <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> inter-regional significance and urban <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> inter-municipal significance...|$|R
