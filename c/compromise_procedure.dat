This cold-fixation (CF) procedure preserved DNA and RNA, so that RNA segments up to 660 bp were efficiently amplified. Histological and immunohistochemical features were fully comparable with those of standard fixation. Microarray-based gene expression profiles were comparable with those obtained on matched frozen samples for probes hybridizing within 700 bases from the reverse transcription start site. In conclusion, CF preserves tissues and nucleic acids, enabling reliable gene expression profiling of fixed tissues...|$|R
40|$|Balancing {{the needs}} of all surface {{transportation}} modes safely and efficiently is an important objective, and especially critical at signalized intersections where turning vehicles and pedestrians share the crosswalk. This thesis identifies a significant gap in the literature for evaluating the impact of right turning vehicles on pedestrian level of service (LOS). A new measure for pedestrian LOS that is sensitive to alternative pedestrian phasing options is proposed and a methodology for field application is developed. This methodology, called the percent compromised method, defines a compromised crossing as a crossing in which the pedestrian is delayed or changes travel path or speed in response to turning vehicles. This method can be applied to individual pedestrians or pedestrian platoons, or can be used to identify the cycles in which there are compromises due to turning vehicles. ^ The percent <b>compromised</b> <b>procedure</b> is then applied to a case study intersection near Disneyland in Anaheim, California to evaluate the impact of a leading pedestrian interval and provide quantitative assessment. This study provided quantitative evidence that the leading pedestrian interval did not perform as well as traditional concurrent pedestrian phasing due to right turns on red. ^ Subsequent chapters describe the application of the percent <b>compromised</b> <b>procedure</b> to thirteen crosswalks at ten intersections in West Lafayette, Indiana, Indianapolis, Indiana, Portland, Oregon, and Cincinnati, Ohio. Approximately seventy-six hours of videotape were analyzed, resulting in a data set of 1, 385 pedestrian crossings. Discrete outcome analysis demonstrated the methodology was sensitive to the right turn flow rate, direction of travel, number of pedestrians during the cycle, signal compliance, and crosswalk location. The raw data from the pedestrian crossings is provided in an electronic form in the dissertation appendices. ^ The dissertation concludes by demonstrating how pedestrian phase data can be integrated with vehicle sensing equipment to provide real-time pedestrian LOS performance measures for pedestrian crossings at signalized intersections. ^ Recommendations are made to extend the methodology to incorporate left turning vehicles and revise Chapter 18 of the Highway Capacity Manual to include a pedestrian LOS measure that more effectively quantifies the negative impact of turning vehicles on pedestrians. ...|$|R

40|$|It is {{the thesis}} of this paper that the main causes {{for the failure of}} the European Constitution result from the bad {{preparation}} and management of a complex process of constitution-making for a union of states of continental proportions. The crucial reasons for the failure of the European Constitution are elaborated as certain preliminary propositions. The first proposition is that in the normative sense, there is no reason and need for the people to be directly engaged {{in the creation of a}} confederal union or in the amending of its fundamental documents. The next and related proposition is that there are powerful political reasons to avoid popular ratification of constitutional documents, especially in federal unions. The argument is that a referendum is more suitable for pulling down than to build up Constitutions is similar to the former – that the people should have nothing with confederations. However, the former argument starts from the normative proposition that the people should not ratify confederal treaties, and the latter means to point out that there could be significant problems with constitutional acceptance when that constitution has to be ratified by some sort of direct involvement of citizens (by people’s conventions or referendum). The third argument is that the European constitution-makers’ ambivalent approach to the method of constitutional ratification and the complete absence of a ratification strategy, resulting in the <b>compromise</b> <b>procedure</b> of ratification “in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements”, was extremely detrimental from the standpoint of ratification. The final error is that they have not made use of comparative experiences of constitution-making of other federal unions...|$|E

With the motivation of addressing these concerns, we propose applying TDEs within a bootstrap aggregation algorithm, and incorporating model selection with complexity penalization.

Analysis of a number of sections in Gauteng, South Africa, has shown that surfacing seals lost a large proportion of their aggregate where the road was crossed by a bridge. As all original properties of the seal components as well as the traffic on the road were similar, it was deduced that the micro-climate where the road traveled underneath the bridge should have caused this localized failure condition.

METHODS: Sixty patients were randomly divided into three groups of 20 each. Each group was submitted to a bowel preparation with one of the following solutions: 10 % manitol, sodium picosulphate or sodium phosphate. The parameters evaluated were: taste, tolerance, associated side effects and quality of cleansing. Postural blood pressure and pulse rate as well as serum sodium, potassium, calcium and phosphate were compared. RESULTS: Sodium phosphate and 10 % manitol solutions provided superior results in terms of colon cleansing compared to sodium picosulphate solution. All serum electrolytes evaluated were significantly altered in the three groups, without important clinical signs. DISCUSSION: High levels of serum phosphate were the most striking alteration in patients prepared with sodium phosphate solution, again with no clinical signs. Variations related to blood pressure and pulse rate suggested contraction of intravascular volume, with no clinical effects. CONCLUSION: Sodium phosphate and 10 % manitol solutions are equivalent in providing good quality colon cleansing, with no significant side effects that could <b>compromise</b> the <b>procedure...</b>|$|R

While {{reducing the number of}} stimuli administered to each cranial site may improve efficiency and decrease physiological demand, doing so may also <b>compromise</b> the <b>procedure’s</b> validity. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} determine the minimum number of stimuli per cranial site required to obtain valid outcomes during TMS mapping.

40|$|In residue {{analysis}} of antibiotics {{quantitative and qualitative}} aspects are involved in declaring a sample non-compliant. The quantitative aspect regards {{the determination of the}} amount of the compound present in the sample. Validation procedures are available to determine the uncertainty of this result, which is taken into account in the decision making process. The qualitative aspect regards the confirmation of the identity of the compound present. In this, selectivity is the main parameter which is defined as the ability of a method to discriminate the analyte being measured from other substances. A trend observed in {{residue analysis}} is towards more generic methods for the detection of a broad range of compounds in a single run. As a result, by definition, selectivity is <b>compromised.</b> <b>Procedures</b> to determine the uncertainty of the qualitative aspect are lacking and, as a result, whether or not a method is adequately selective is a matter of experts’ judgment. In this thesis a method is presented for grading selectivity of methods using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Based on the outcome it can be stated if selectivity is adequate and thus if a confirmatory result stands strong when challenged in a court case. If selectivity is found inadequate, additional measures can be taken like the selection of another product ion or the use of a third product ion to obtain adequate selectivity. Furthermore, two examples of analyses are presented in which selectivity plays an important role. First, the analysis of the banned antibiotic chloramphenicol (CAP). CAP contains two chiral centers and the nitro-group can either be para- or meta-substituted. Therefore, eight different isomers of CAP occur of which only RR-p-CAP is antimicrobially active. In the analysis of CAP, extreme selectivity is needed to distinguish the antimicrobially active compound from its inactive isomers. A method applying chiral liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry was developed to discriminate antimicrobially active CAP for its inactive isomers. Also the research for the possible natural occurrence of this drug is presented. It is shown that CAP can be produced in unamended soil by Streptomyces venezuelaein appreciable amounts and that crops can take up CAP from soils. Therefore, it is concluded that CAP can occur in crops and animal feed due to its natural production by soil bacteria. Second, the development of a multi-ß-lactam method is presented. In this method a derivatization is applied to be able to effectively detect off-label ceftiofur use. In this selectivity is intentionally compromised and no unequivocal confirmation can be carried out using this method. The developed method is applicable {{to a wide range of}} ß-lactam antibiotics including penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems and is the best method available today for effective monitoring of off-label ß-lactam usage in poultry breeding.  ...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} is report the long-term outcomes of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms associated with aneurysm of the common iliac artery following endovascular repair using a bifurcated bell-bottom stent graft. Methods: This is a retrospective study that evaluated patients treated with bifurcated bell-bottom extension stent grafts to repair an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm and who had at least one common iliac artery with dilatation > 1. 5 cm for at least 12 months after the endovascular intervention. Results: Thirty-eight patients {{with a mean age of}} 70. 4 ± 8. 2 years were included. Stent graft placement was followed by dilation of the common iliac artery aneurysms in 35. 3 % of cases; endoleak and reoperation rates were 17. 6 % and 15. 7 %, respectively. Younger patients showed a higher rate of artery diameter increase following the procedure. The average arterial dilation was 16 % in the first year, 29 % in the second year, 57 % in the third year and 95 % from the fourth year until the end of follow-up. Conclusion: Repair of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms with bifurcated bell-bottom type stents when there is common iliac artery dilation is a good therapeutic option to preserve hypogastric flow. The rate of endoleak was 17. 6 %, and 15. 7 % of cases required reoperation. Younger patients are more likely to experience dilation of the common iliac artery after the procedure...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium parvum can cause severe {{symptoms}} in humans, particularly those who are immunologically <b>compromised.</b> Immunoassay <b>procedures</b> offer both increased sensitivity and specificity compared to conventional staining methods. These reagents are also helpful when screening large numbers of patients, particularly in an outbreak situation or when screening patients with minimal symptoms. The data obtained by using 9 diagnostic kits were compared: direct fluorescent-antibody assay (DFA) kits (TechLab Giardia/Crypto IF kit, TechLab Crypto IF kit, and Meridian Merifluor Cryptosporidium/Giardia) and enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kits (Alexon ProSpecT Giardia EZ Microplate Assay, Alexon ProSpecT Cryptosporidium Microplate Assay, Cambridge Giardia lamblia Antigen Microwell ELISA, Meridian Premier Giardia lamblia, Meridian Premier Cryptosporidium, TechLab Giardia CELISA, Trend Giardia lamblia EIA). The test with the Meridian Merifluor Cryptosporidium/Giardia kit was used as the reference method. In various combinations, 60 specimens positive for Giardia, 60 specimens positive for Cryptosporidium, 40 specimens positive for a Giardia-Cryptosporidium mix, and 50 negative fecal specimens were tested. Different species (nine protozoa, three coccidia, one microsporidium, five nematodes, three cestodes, and one trematode) were included in the negative specimens. The sensitivity of EIA for Giardia ranged from 94 % (Alexon) to 99 % (Trend and Cambridge); the specificity was 100 % with all EIA kits tested. The sensitivity of EIA for Cryptosporidium ranged from 98 % (Alexon) to 99 % (Meridian Premier); specificities were 100 %. All DFA results were in agreement, with 100 % sensitivity and specificity; however, the TechLab reagents resulted in fluorescence intensity that was generally one level below that seen with the reagents used in the reference method. In addition to sensitivity and specificity, factors such as cost, simplicity, ease of interpretation of results (color, intensity of fluorescence), equipment, available personnel, and number of tests ordered are also important considerations prior to kit selection...|$|R
40|$|There is {{no clear}} {{consensus}} concerning the best endoscopic treatment of benign refractory esophageal strictures due to caustic ingestion. Different procedures are currently used: frequent multiple dilations, retrievable self-expanding stent, nasogastric intubation and surgery. We describe a new technique to fix a suspended esophageal silicone prosthesis to the neck in benign esophageal strictures; this permits us to avoid the frequent risk of migration of the expandable metallic or plastic stents. Under general anesthesia a rigid esophagoscope {{was placed in the}} patient's hypopharynx. Using transillumination from the optical device, the patient's neck was pierced with a needle. A n. 0 monofilament surgical wire was pushed into the needle, grasped by a standard foreign body forceps through the esophagoscope and pulled out of the mouth (as in percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy procedure). After tying the proximal end of the silicone prosthesis with the wire, it was placed through the strictures under endoscopic view. This procedure was successfully utilized in four patients suffering from benign refractory esophageal strictures due to caustic ingestion. The prosthesis and its suspension from the neck were well-tolerated until removal (mean duration 4 months). A postoperative transitory myositis was diagnosed in only one patient. One of the most frequent complications of esophageal prostheses in refractory esophageal strictures due to caustic ingestion is distal migration. Different solutions were proposed. For example the suspension of a wire coming from the nose and then fixed behind the ear. This solution is not considered optimal because of patient complaints and moreover the aesthetic aspect is <b>compromised.</b> The <b>procedure</b> we utilized in four patients utilized the setting of a silicone tube hanging from the neck in a way similar to that of endoscopic pharyngostomy. This solution is a valid alternative both for quality of life and for functional results...|$|R
