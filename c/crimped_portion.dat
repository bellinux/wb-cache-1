40|$|Usually, {{development}} of automobile brake hose and power steering hose has been realized through investigating several actual prototype hoses experimentally. Recently, high durability for brake hose has been required because periodic renewing the brake hoses {{has not been}} requested anymore. In this study, FEM stress analysis {{has been applied to}} the <b>crimped</b> <b>portion</b> of hydraulic brake hose in order to promote the {{development of}} the automobile hoses more efficiently. It is found that large normal stresses σ_n, which may be helpful for the sealing performance, appear at the <b>crimped</b> <b>portion</b> between the nipple and inner rubber. The results suggest that several grooves putting at the surface of nipple are effective for causing large σ_n, which may improve the sealing performance and hose life. The effect of compression set of the rubber on the sealing performance is investigated, and the life of hydraulic brake hose is estimated form the maximum stress appearing near the groove on the nipple...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effects of}} {{reinforcement}} geometry, in 2 D and 3 D woven fabric-reinforced composites, on {{the progression of}} damage and perforation failure at quasi-static loading rates (10 – 80 mm/s) are investigated. The broad classes of glass-fiber-reinforced systems that were examined include 2 D plain-woven laminates, 3 D orthogonally woven monolithic systems, and 3 D orthogonally woven laminates. The experimental {{results indicate that the}} 3 D laminates consistently had greater damage tolerance than the 2 D laminates and the 3 D monolithic composites. The enhanced damage tolerance of the 3 D systems is due to unique energy absorption mechanisms, which involve the <b>crimped</b> <b>portion</b> of z-tows. KEY WORDS: quasi-static puncture, GFRP, 3 D orthogonal weave, damage progression...|$|E
5000|$|If {{the coil}} is {{designed}} to be energized with alternating current (AC), some method is used to split the flux into two out-of-phase components which add together, increasing the minimum pull on the armature during the AC cycle. Typically this is done with a small copper [...] "shading ring" [...] <b>crimped</b> around a <b>portion</b> of the core that creates the delayed, out-of-phase component, which holds the contacts during the zero crossings of the control voltage.|$|R
