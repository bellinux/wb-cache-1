Three topics were investigated: {{comparison}} of the original global DNSSEC trust model and the <b>TAR</b> <b>based</b> island model; the future of TAR; and how DNSSEC and TAR {{can be used in}} Network Resource Provisioning (NRP). TAR emerged as an interim solution to speed up DNSSEC deployment but is currently considered as a technology that can solve known issues with interdomain trust management in an open Internet environment. With TAR it is possible to implement DNSSEC in some zones without signing the root. This creates so-called islands of trust where the trust relations to those islands is maintained through TAR. The traditional DNSSEC implementation suggests out of band communication to verify the initial trust anchor, while the <b>TAR</b> <b>based</b> DNSSEC infrastructure can provide and requires periodic or on-demand lookup. There are in-band examples (DLV) as well as out-of-band examples (through HTTPS etc.).

Research on the future of TAR’s shows that there is a different outlook by standardization organizations if TAR’s should remain in effect after the DNS root zone has been signed. I...|$|R
