50|$|If {{there is}} a chance that the prints got dirty, there are several {{effective}} methods that can be undertaken to clean them carefully without damaging them. First off is using a soft brush that can remove surface dirt on the print. Make sure to lightly brush the dirt off of the print. Damping cotton swabs or using a specialized <b>cleaning</b> <b>pad</b> to dry wipe the surface of the print is also another method to clean it. Remember to never wash photographs until the gelatin layer is dry and stables. Furthermore, never attempt chemical treatments on color photographs because they can get distorted and destroy the image as a whole.|$|E
50|$|In January 2010, Evolution Robotics {{released}} Mint (model number: 4200), {{a cleaning}} robot which dusts and wet-mops hard surface floors. The robot systematically covers the floor line-by-line and cleans {{around the edges}} before it returns to its original position. Mint {{is one of the}} most quiet floor cleaning robot (it has no vacuum motor), but it is not a fully autonomous robot. The cleaning cloth has to be attached to the <b>cleaning</b> <b>pad</b> before cleaning and it has to be removed after it is done. It could cover 93 sq m (1000 sq ft) mode and 23 sq m (250 sq ft) in wet mopping mode. Mint used a navigation cube as a beacon for navigation, and the original model was only able to handle one of these beacons at a time. The indoor navigation system is called NorthStar®.|$|E

40|$|The steam {{cleaning}} effluent ponds (SCEP) waste unit {{is located in}} Area 6 at the Nevada Test Site (NTS). Nevada Operations Office operates the NTS and has entered into a trilateral agreement with the State of Nevada and the Defense Special Weapons Agency (DSWA). The trilateral agreement provides a framework for identifying, characterizing, remediating, and closing environmental sites on the NTS and associated bombing ranges. The SCEP waste unit consists of: two {{steam cleaning}} effluent ponds; layout pad and associated grease trap; Building 6 - 623 steam cleaning pad; test pad; Building 6 - 623 grease trap; Building 6 - 800 steam cleaning pad; Building 6 - 800 separator; Building 6 - 621 sump; and the concrete asbestos piping connecting these components to both SCEPs. Clean closure is the recommended closure strategy {{for the majority of}} the components within this CAU. Four components of the unit (Building 6 - 621 Sump, Test Pad Grease Trap, Building 6 - 623 Steam <b>Cleaning</b> <b>Pad,</b> and North SCEP pipeline) are recommended to be closed in place. This closure plan provides the strategy and backup information necessary to support the clean closure of each of the individual components within CAU 93.

40|$|AbstractAn {{electro-deposition}} {{approach was}} established to incorporate the gold nano-flakes onto the glassy carbon electrode in electrochemical cells (nano-Au/GC/ECCs). Using pulsed amperometric detection (PAD) without any gold oxidation for <b>cleaning</b> (non-oxidative <b>PAD),</b> the nano-Au/GC/ECCs were able to maintain their activity for oxidizing of carbohydrates in a normal alkaline medium. The reproducibility of peak area was about 2 relative standard deviation (RSD,%) for 6 consecutive injections. A dynamic range of carbohydrates was obtained over a concentration range of 5 – 80 mgL− 1 {{and the limits of}} detection (LOD) were of 2 mgL− 1 for fructose and lactose and 1 mgL− 1 for glucose and galactose. Moreover, the nano-Au/GC/ECC using the non-oxidative PAD was able to combine with the internal standard method for determination of lactose in fresh cow milk sample...|$|R
40|$|Polyurethane (PU) pad debris is {{identified}} {{as one of the}} major polish residue defects in Cu CMP processes when a barrier pad is conditioned. AES analysis of the debris confirms the organic nature of such defects while FT-IR analysis reveals the characteristic peaks of polyurethane from the pad debris. Hybrid cleans (i. e. acidic plus basic cleans) and basic cleans can both remove the pad debris effectively. The efficiency of basic-only cleans can be improved by increasing time and/or chemistry concentration in the brush modules. The PU pad can endure harsh chemical environments at both low and high pH without any detectable decomposition or morphological changes. The advantages and disadvantages of acidic vs. basic cleans are discussed and the <b>cleaning</b> mechanisms of <b>pad</b> debris PR are elucidated...|$|R
5000|$|Besides {{the usual}} {{malfunctions}} common to laser printers with worn rollers or accumulated paper dust, older IIISi and 4Si printers eventually exhibit a [...] "phantom paper jam." [...] On longer documents, the printer will stop and report a paper jam, {{but with no}} visible reason why the paper wasn't feeding correctly. There {{are a couple of}} solenoids at the paper tray input mechanism that have felt pads designed to cushion them when they snap on, and the glue holding these pads in place can migrate to the surface. This delays the release of the solenoid, which causes the paper to start feeding slightly late. The error accumulates with each page printed, and eventually the paper is entering the mechanism so late that the printer believes that a jam has occurred. The tell-tale symptom is a print job with a top margin that shrinks from page to page. This problem is fixed by removing the felt <b>pads,</b> <b>cleaning</b> off the adhesive (isopropyl alcohol works well), and placing some electrical tape or other material to provide a cushion for the solenoid. Unfortunately, accessing the solenoids requires disassembling most of the input mechanism.|$|R
40|$|The {{first study}} {{described}} in this report involved housing 66 spring calving heifers {{in one of three}} systems during the winter, namely, (i) a conventional cubicle house, (ii) a cubicle house with cushioned flooring covering the slats (slat mats) in the passageway and (iii) on a wood-chip out-wintering pad. Behaviour, health and performance indicators were measured on all animals while pregnant from housing in November 2003 until calving in January 2004. Additionally, data were collected on the first 15 animals to calve in each treatment for the first four weeks of lactation in the spring. The slat mats resulted in some improvements to hoof health compared to the conventional cubicle house. Furthermore, it increased feeding times although this had no effect on feed intake or performance. The results also indicated that heifers have a preference for standing on cushioned flooring rather than on concrete during late pregnancy. Both groups indoors differed greatly from the outdoor heifers in several respects. The outdoor animals had healthier feet and were less affected by injuries to the limbs. They also had a more diverse behaviour repertoire and slipped and tripped less. However, their welfare was adversely affected by inclement weather conditions with indications of immunosuppression combined with a reduction in average daily gain being recorded. Furthermore, they were dirtier and spent less time lying down. None of these factors influenced milk yield, quality or composition in early lactation. Welfare problems associated with the pad were weather and management dependent and hence could be addressed by more frequent <b>cleaning</b> of the <b>pad</b> and/or an increase in space allowance combined with the provision of shelter. Hence, the potential for good welfare in dairy heifers was higher on the pad than indoors in a cubicle system even when slat mats were provided. In the second study, 62 autumn calving pluriparous dairy cows were housed in September 2004 in a cubicle system with either solid concrete floors or solid concrete floors covered by a rubber mat and cleaned by an automatic scrapper. Behaviour, locomotion and foot lesion scores were recorded from at least 3 weeks prior to calving until at least 16 weeks post-partum. Furthermore, in-depth measures of oestrous behaviour and reproductive performance were recorded. The cushioned flooring had no effect on sole or white line lesion scores or on dermatitis scores. However, it reduced the rate of wear of the heels in early lactation. Cows on cushioned flooring spent more time standing, but not feeding, at the feed face while cows on concrete stood in the cubicles instead. It appears that where cows have access to spacious, well-designed cubicles they can use them for standing to get relief for their feet from the concrete. Similar to the previous study this also indicates that cows prefer to stand on cushioned flooring than on bare concrete and emphasises the importance of at least providing cows with mats or mattresses in their cubicles. There were no effects of the cushioned flooring on oestrous behaviour or reproductive performance, which was poor in both treatments. It is suggested that the reasons for this were that the cushioned flooring did not provide sufficient traction for the cows and so they were as reluctant as the cows on concrete to perform mounting behaviour.
