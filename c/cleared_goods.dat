60|$|In his plots Bulwer has {{generally}} been simple, facile, and successful. The reader never feels with him, as he does with Wilkie Collins, that it is all plot, or, as with George Eliot, {{that there is no}} plot. The story comes naturally without calling for too much attention, and is thus proof of the completeness of the man's intellect. His language is <b>clear,</b> <b>good,</b> intelligible English, but it is defaced by mannerism. In all that he did, affectation was his fault.|$|R

A descriptive survey design was used on freight forwarding firms. The researcher used purposive sampling to select firms for the study. Interview guides were used as data collection instruments. The study found out that; demurrage charges through delays, wars, loss from fire out breaks, piracy, damage and destruction of goods, sinking of vessels and fraud by employees in position of authority were the major factors hindering the success of this industry in facilitating imports and exports. The government should also make use of the latest technologies so as to increase the speed of <b>clearing</b> <b>goods</b> such that they reach their final point of consumption within the shortest possible time. The freight forwarding industry should also engage professionals who have adequate knowledge and experience in <b>clearing</b> of <b>goods...</b>|$|R

It was replaced by twice-daily road motor services, with a journey time reduced by two hours, and additional services were available for market days on Thursdays. Use of the railway line was reduced to the three goods trains per week needed to <b>clear</b> <b>goods</b> traffic.|$|R
40|$|How {{corruption}} affects firm-level {{trade costs}} remains an important though relatively unexplored {{line of inquiry}} in the trade literature. Corruption can increase trade costs if it represents an additional tax firms {{have to pay to}} <b>clear</b> <b>goods</b> across borders, or it can decrease trade costs if it allows firms to circumvent cumbersome bureaucratic procedures or reduce clearing times. This chapter discusses novel evidence from corruption patterns in two ports in Southern Africa, to shed light on the determinants and on the implications for international trade of corruption in transport networks...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that firms can reduce fixed trade costs by hiring {{intermediaries}} like trading companies. I argue that customs brokers – a type of intermediary rarely studied in economics before – can play a similar role. Using panel data of Norwegian trade transactions, I show that such brokers are commonly used to <b>clear</b> <b>goods</b> through customs. I find indications of lower sunk costs as well as fixed trade costs for firms that hire such services. However, engaging brokers can be risky, and traders in high-risk products like food {{are more likely to}} self-declare. Results are similar for importing and exporting, indicating that customs brokers facilitate both modes of trade...|$|R

50|$|The seller {{delivers}} {{when the}} goods are placed alongside the buyer's vessel at the named port of shipment. This {{means that the}} buyer has to bear all costs and risks of loss of or damage to the goods from that moment. The FAS term requires the seller to <b>clear</b> the <b>goods</b> for export, which is a reversal from previous Incoterms versions that required the buyer to arrange for export clearance. However, if the parties wish the buyer to <b>clear</b> the <b>goods</b> for export, this should be made clear by adding explicit wording to this effect in the contract of sale. This term should be used only for non-containerized seafreight and inland waterway transport.|$|R
