40|$|The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (2 ̆ 2 ERISA 2 ̆ 2), {{the federal}} law that regulates employer-sponsored benefit plans, has a rich history of judiciallycreated federal common law. This Article explores the theoretical, policy, statutory, and stare decisis grounds for the {{development}} of another area offederal common law under ERISA-the incorporation of respondeat superior liability principles to impose ERISA fiduciary liability (2 ̆ 2 vicarious fiduciary liability 2 ̆ 2) upon a corporation for the fiduciary activities of its employees or agents. The Article proposes that the federal courts should adopt a federal common law rule of vicarious fiduciary liability under ERISA based on the traditional scope of employment approach. Under such a rule, a <b>corporate</b> <b>principal</b> whose own internal employees or agents perform fiduciary functions during the course and within the scope of their employment or agency relationship would be strictly liable under ERISA for any breach of fiduciary duty by the employee or agent. Vicarious fiduciary liability should be limited, however, so that a nonfiduciary <b>corporate</b> <b>principal</b> would not be subject to damages claims under ERISA for the rogue fiduciary activities of its employees or agents, but would be subject to restitution as necessary to prevent unjust enrichment of the principal. A federal common law rule of vicarious fiduciary liability under ERISA is necessary for two reasons. First, a rule of vicarious fiduciary liability is essential to maintaining and enforcing ERISA 2 ̆ 7 s comprehensive system offiduciary regulation. Second, vicarious fiduciary liability is needed to prevent employer overreaching under the judicially-created settlor function defense to breach of fiduciary duty claims. Absent a federal common law rule of vicarious fiduciary liability, a corporate employer in its nonfiduciary capacity as the settlor of its ERISA plan, may design the documents that govern the employer 2 ̆ 7 s plan as a shield against fiduciary responsibility for the actions of the employer 2 ̆ 7 s own internal fiduciary employees. This misuse of nonfiduciary settlor powers, which is contrary to both the letter and the spirit of ERISA, would be prevented by a federal common law rule of vicarious fiduciary liability...|$|E

This Article explores the potential for development of another area of federal common law under ERISA - the incorporation of respondeat superior liability principles to impose ERISA fiduciary liability (2 ̆ 2 vicarious fiduciary liability 2 ̆ 2) upon a corporation for the fiduciary activities of its employees or agents. This claims and remedies system requires that vicarious fiduciary liability must be limited so that a nonfiduciary <b>corporate</b> <b>principal</b> is not subject to a damages claim under ERISA if an employee or an agent of the principal acts in a 2 ̆ 2 rogue 2 ̆ 2 manner as a fiduciary with respect to an ERISA plan. The question simply was not {{at the forefront of the}} immediate problems of trust asset mismanagement in the multiemployer and defined benefit plan context that Congress sought to resolve through ERISA 2 ̆ 7 s fiduciary responsibilities provisions. ERISA, however, defines 2 ̆ 2 fiduciary 2 ̆ 2 not in terms of formal trusteeship, but in functional terms of control and authority over the plan, thus expanding the universe of persons subject to fiduciary duties - and to damages - under ERISA. Similarly, external corporate fiduciaries and external nonfiduciary service providers who assist employers in administering and operating their ERISA plans may increase the fees for their services if the parameters of vicarious fiduciary liability are ill-defined and therefore difficult to monitor and control. If imposing vicarious fiduciary liability makes corporate employers the proverbial deep pocket for the misconduct of internal fiduciary employees, then employers are likely to respond by engaging in tactics to protect corporate assets from fiduciary liability. To be consistent with ERISA 2 ̆ 7 s statutory scheme for claims and remedies under section 502 (a), a federal common law rule of vicarious liability must be limited by modifying the common law rule that imposed respondeat superior liability upon a principal who approved or ratified an agent 2 ̆ 7 s injurious conduct that occurred outside the scope of employment...|$|E

I integrate a proportional corporation tax and a proportional wage tax into a binary principal-agent model. The wage tax increases the remuneration costs and makes the agent's employment less attractive. Thus, the principal tends to demand lower rather than higher effort or does not offer a contract at all. In contrast to the wage tax, the corporate tax is irrelevant for the optimal remuneration contract. Under asymmetric <b>corporate</b> taxation, the <b>principal</b> tends to offer contracts less frequently.

40|$|Twenty years ago, the New York Limited Liability Company Law was enacted, {{including}} § 609 (a), which explicitly disclaims {{liability of}} members, managers, and agents for the debts and obligations of the LLC. However, New York courts {{have held that}} this limitation on liability is not absolute, and certain conduct {{on the part of}} the owners can erode the liability shield. The statute provides that the members will not have personal liability for LLC debts solely because of their role as owners in the LLC. The statute does not say that members will never have liability, just that any liability will not be as a result of their owner status, leaving open the question of when members will be liable for debts of the LLC. Neither the language of § 609 (a) itself or its legislative history offer any guidance on what factors a court should use to determine whether to pierce an LLC. Since LLCs are a blend of partnerships and corporation, the relevant inquiry is to determine whether, for purposes of owner liability, an LLC is more like a corporation, with its default rule of limited liability, or more like a partnership, where partners have unlimited personal liability for all partnership debts. Unlike the Model Business Corporation Act, and the states that have adopted it, New York’s Business Corporation Law has no statutory limitation on liability equivalent to § 609. However, New York has a well-established body of case law permitting courts to disregard shareholder limited liability based on shareholder conduct. New York courts, like others across the country, began by applying <b>corporate</b> <b>principals</b> of piercing the corporate veil when evaluating claims to pierce an LLC. The complete lack of statutory guidance on the factors necessary to pierce LLCs leaves judges with tremendous discretion, resulting in some uneven and sometimes insupportable results. This Article explores the history of LLC veil piercing doctrine, starting with an exploration of the approach set out in the Revised Uniform Limited Liability Company Act RULLCA and a brief look at the approaches states take to piercing the LLC veil, with a close examination of the NYLLCA. The Article then reviews the New York case law on piercing the corporate veil and the evolution of this doctrine by state and federal courts in the context of LLCs. The Article concludes with some suggestions for refining the continuing development of the LLC piercing doctrine in New York in a thoughtful and deliberate manner so as to avoid inconsistent and arbitrary results...|$|R
