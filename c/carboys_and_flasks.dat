It is argued by Francisco Prado-Vilar that this scene could represent a ceremony performed in the court of al-Hakam II that would be of political significance to al-Mughira and act as a reminder to him of the continuation and solidity of the dynasty.|$|R

5000|$|... #Caption: The {{value of}} K changes with temperature. In the {{endothermic}} reaction N2O4(g) &#8652; 2NO2(g), the equilibrium position can be shifted {{by changing the}} temperature. When heat is added and the temperature increases, the reaction shifts to the right <b>and</b> the <b>flask</b> turns reddish brown due {{to an increase in}} NO2. When heat is removed and the temperature decreases, the reaction shifts to the left <b>and</b> <b>flask</b> turns colorless due to an increase in N2O4. This demonstrates Le Châtelier’s Principle because the equilibrium shifts in the direction that consumes energy.|$|R
