5|$|For Cagney's next film, he {{traveled}} to Ireland for Shake Hands with the Devil, directed by Michael Anderson. Cagney had hoped {{to spend some time}} tracing his Irish ancestry, but time constraints and poor weather meant that he was unable to do so. The overriding message of violence inevitably leading to more violence attracted Cagney to the role of an Irish Republican Army commander, and resulted in what some <b>critics</b> <b>would</b> regard as the finest performance of his final years.|$|E
5|$|Giselle was revived in 1863 {{with new}} costumes by Lormier's assistant, Alfred Albert. Albert's costumes {{are closer to}} those of modern {{productions}} than those of Lormier, and were in use at the opera until 1868. The ballet was revived again in 1924 with scenery and costumes by Alexandre Benois. He wanted to revive the costumes of the original production but dropped the idea, believing the <b>critics</b> <b>would</b> charge him {{with a lack of}} imaginative creativity.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{spending}} time in Sydney's art community, in 1954 Haefliger and Bellette purchased a cottage in Hill End, an old gold mining village in central New South Wales. They added a studio, and the site became both a weekender and a venue for social visits and artistic endeavours by colleagues from the Sydney circle, including Drysdale, Margaret Olley, John Olsen, David Edgar Strachan and Donald Friend. This gathering of artists, {{sometimes referred to as}} the Hill End Group, is known for its landscape art. Bellette, though sometimes a painter of landscapes, was known for her classical subjects and still lifes, which critics struggled to accommodate within their understanding of the Hill End Group. Nevertheless, several still lifes from this period are held in public collections, including Still Life with Fish (1954), in the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, and Still life with wooden bowl (c. 1954), in the Art Gallery of New South Wales. These images were often rendered with strong colour, which was also sometimes a feature of earlier works on which <b>critics</b> <b>would</b> remark.|$|E

2500|$|Especially {{the guitar}} {{playing on the}} album was paid {{attention}} to, with one critic drawing parallels to Suede: [...] "Junnu Alajuuma's Bernard Butler-affected joyful playing is fearless, majestic and actually a deciding factor in Come Inside's overall sound." [...] (transl.) [...] Another <b>critic</b> <b>would</b> simply exclaim [...] "Come Inside is got [...] damn better than Suede." ...|$|R
6000|$|Fenn {{played the}} [...] "Moonlight Sonata". A trained musical <b>critic</b> <b>would</b> {{probably}} have found much to cavil at in his {{rendering of the}} piece, but it was undoubtedly good for a public school player. Of course he was encored. The gallery would have encored {{him if he had}} played with one finger, three mistakes to every bar.|$|R
5|$|Mansfield {{attempted}} to defuse public concern by staging the London {{opening of the}} comedy Prince Karl as a charity performance, despite Stoker's warning that <b>critics</b> <b>would</b> view it {{as an attempt to}} obtain favorable publicity for the production. Although some press reports suggested that Mansfield stopped performing Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in London because of the murders, financial reasons are more likely. Despite widespread publicity due to the murders and Mansfield's disputes with Bandmann, attendance was mediocre, and the production was losing money. On December 1, Mansfield's tenancy at the Lyceum ended. He left London, taking his company on a tour of England. In December they performed Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and other plays in Liverpool and Derby, then continued to other cities and performed other plays.|$|E
25|$|For the {{remainder}} of his presidency, Lincoln's many <b>critics</b> <b>would</b> hound him for the seemingly cowardly act of sneaking through Baltimore at night, in disguise, sacrificing his honor for his personal safety. However, the efforts at security may well have been prudent.|$|E
25|$|Following U.S. Congressional hearings, the Condon Committee was {{established}} in 1966, ostensibly as a neutral scientific research body. However, the Committee became mired in controversy, with some members charging director Edward U. Condon with bias, and <b>critics</b> <b>would</b> question the validity and the scientific rigor of the Condon Report.|$|E
60|$|In short {{the thing}} is but an embryo, and whilst it remains in manuscript, which it is destined to do, the <b>critic</b> <b>would</b> judge {{unjustly}} who should call it a miscarriage. It furnished me with a most important lesson, namely, that to have conceived strongly, does not always imply the power of successful execution. S. T. C.|$|R

25|$|A {{frequent}} charge laid by {{the critics}} of the Commissioners' Plan is that the excavation and leveling necessary to implement it basically destroyed the topography of Manhattan.

25|$|By 1905, Mata Hari {{began to}} win fame as an exotic dancer. She was a {{contemporary}} of dancers Isadora Duncan and Ruth St. Denis, {{leaders in the}} early modern dance movement, which {{around the turn of}} the 20th century looked to Asia and Egypt for artistic inspiration. <b>Critics</b> <b>would</b> later write about this and other such movements within the context of Orientalism. Gabriel Astruc became her personal booking agent.|$|E
25|$|Critics and {{supporters}} are largely in factual agreement regarding {{the characteristics of}} null hypothesis significance testing (NHST): While it can provide critical information, it is inadequate as the sole tool for statistical analysis. Successfully rejecting the null hypothesis may offer no support for the research hypothesis. The continuing controversy concerns {{the selection of the}} best statistical practices for the near-term future given the (often poor) existing practices. <b>Critics</b> <b>would</b> prefer to ban NHST completely, forcing a complete departure from those practices, while supporters suggest a less absolute change.|$|E
5000|$|The {{tour was}} a high point of {{commercial}} success for Bowie, who found his new popularity perplexing. Bowie would later remark that {{with the success of}} Let's Dance and the Serious Moonlight Tour, he had lost track of who his fans were or what they wanted. One <b>critic</b> <b>would</b> later call this tour his [...] "most accessible" [...] because [...] "it had few props and one costume change, from peach suit to blue." ...|$|R
25|$|The rumor seemed {{unlikely}} to be true for several reasons: {{the two young men}} came from different states and had never met before being brought to the MacLab; if they were both conspiring with Randi, then the plot had gone on for 21 months. What <b>critic</b> <b>would</b> be so persistent in engaging in fraud and conspiracy on such a time-scale? There seemed to be no precedent. Nor was it possible to track down how reliable the rumor might be.|$|R

25|$|In 1989, NBC premiered Saved by the Bell, a live-action teen sitcom which {{originated}} on The Disney Channel {{the previous}} year as Good Morning, Miss Bliss (which served as a starring vehicle for Hayley Mills; four cast members from that show were cast in the NBC series as the characters they originally played on Miss Bliss). Saved by the Bell, despite being given bad reviews from television <b>critics,</b> <b>would</b> {{become one of the}} most popular teen series in television history as well as the top-rated series on Saturday mornings, dethroning ABC's The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show in its first season.|$|E
25|$|The Deep: An {{adaptation}} of Charles Williams' Dead Calm. The picture was entirely set on two boats and shot mostly in close-ups, and was filmed off {{the coasts of}} Yugoslavia and the Bahamas, between 1966 and 1969, with all but one scene completed. Originally planned as commercially viable thriller, to show that Welles could make a popular, successful film. It was put on hold in 1970 when Welles worried that <b>critics</b> <b>would</b> not respond favourably to this film as his theatrical follow-up to the much-lauded Chimes at Midnight, and Welles focused instead on F for Fake. It was abandoned altogether in 1973 due {{to the death of}} its star Laurence Harvey.|$|E
25|$|Marlon Brando was {{the first}} to bring a natural {{approach}} to acting on film. According to Dustin Hoffman in his online Masterclass, Brando would often talk to camera men and fellow actors about their weekend even after the director would call action. Once Brando felt he could deliver the dialogue as natural as that conversation he would start the dialogue. In his 2015 documentary, Listen To Me Marlon, he said before that actors were like breakfast cereals. He was calling them predictable. <b>Critics</b> <b>would</b> later say this was Brando being difficult, but actors who worked opposite would say it was just all part of his technique.|$|E

60|$|I must admit, as one to whom {{contemporary}} {{literature is}} constantly submitted for criticism, {{that the only}} thing that ever prejudices me against a book is the lack of literary style; but I can quite understand how any ordinary <b>critic</b> <b>would</b> be strongly prejudiced against a work that was accompanied by a premature and unnecessary panegyric from the publisher. A publisher is simply a useful middleman. It is not for him to anticipate the verdict of criticism.|$|R
25|$|Upon {{stepping}} {{down from his}} position at the Normal School, Hewett decided {{that he needed to}} improve his academic credentials in order to advance. He earned a doctorate in anthropology from the University of Geneva in 1904. He spent little time in residence at the university, developing his dissertation mainly by collating a number of papers which he had written previously (a practice that, in the eyes of Hewett's many <b>critics,</b> <b>would</b> characterize and compromise much of his later writing as well) and having them translated into the required French. The resulting dissertation, bearing the title Les Communautés anciennes dans le desert Americain, was favorably received, and sufficed to earn Hewett his degree despite his inability to defend it in the customary French.|$|E
25|$|After {{five years}} of non stop {{recording}} and touring and having lost touch with reality, the band {{decided to take a}} sabbatical in 1997. They worked on some demos in January 1998, but did not find the band dynamics revitalized, and the trio decided to split up on 10 March 1998 when discussing the future of the band on a bench in the Rosenborg Castle Gardens. The split occurred amidst a wave of prominent Danish bands disbanding. <b>Critics</b> <b>would</b> later explain their decision as the band having the courage to stop in time despite enormous success, although it was largely due to fatigue that the trio could not bring themselves to continuing to play. Their tastes in music had also become less compatible, with Christensen wanting a more vintage Beatles-like sound and Nielsen and Friis preferring to make heavy metal music.|$|E
25|$|Brando {{would later}} say in his 2015 documentary, Listen to me Marlon, {{that he felt}} the part in On the Waterfront that won him an Oscar was to him personally, not good, and that {{he knew he had}} done better acting. In the behind the scenes of On the Waterfront film experts and <b>critics</b> <b>would</b> say he would change lines because he didn't like the script, and that he'd let the {{director}} know by having regular conversations. However, This was a way for Brando to prepare before a scene by warming up before starting the dialogue, in order to deliver it as natural as possible. Brando often saw a shrink, and reportedly wasn't there for some of the shooting of the scene when the close up was on the opposite actor. This is why this part of his technique is recognized mistakenly as him being difficult, and not a part of his approach.|$|E
5000|$|The Critic {{originally}} received mixed {{to positive}} reviews {{when it first}} aired. In 1994, The Chicago Sun-Times gave a typical review of the show with, [...] "Jay Sherman, the eponymous culture vulture of The <b>Critic,</b> <b>would</b> undoubtedly say his new animated comedy on ABC 'stinks.' Fortunately for him Critic smells pretty good to me." [...] The show has since developed a cult following, with much of it coming through the show's weekend reruns on Comedy Central up until about 2005.|$|R

25|$|Rushmore {{continued}} {{as a reporter}} for the Mexico Intelligencer. On January 12, 1931, Rushmore witnessed the lynching of Raymond Gunn in Maryville, Missouri. The African American suspect was seized from the local sheriff and doused with gasoline atop a roof and set aflame, while several thousands watched. The event made an indelible mark on the 17-year-old, who, even {{at the height of his}} anti-communist career, would maintain Gunn's complete innocence. The Communist Party USA in Kansas City organized an anti-lynch committee led by Abner Berry, a party organizer in Harlem during the 1940s. Rushmore was impressed by the bravery and anti-racist stance of the communists. Through the committee, Rushmore met Jack Conroy, editor of The Anvil, a communist literary magazine. Conroy encouraged Rushmore's literary ambitions by suggesting he submit short stories. By April 1935 Rushmore had become an associate editor of the magazine. Later that year, Rushmore joined the Young Communist League USA in St Louis, despite having neither a technical knowledge of Marxist philosophy nor its history. This lifelong ignorance would hamper his authority as a professional communist and anti-communist as <b>critics</b> <b>would</b> question his qualifications on the subject. He organized farmers in the Dakotas and Iowa, then Conroy sent him to New York City in May 1935, where he attended the American Writers Congress. There he was asked to join the editorial staff of the Young Worker, the organ of the Young Communist League. Taking advantage of his perceived all-American background, the CPUSA rapidly promoted Rushmore. All staff members of the Young Worker were assigned to a political unit of the Young Communist League. Rushmore belonged to the Harlem unit, where he met Ruby Bates, a recent recruit to the League. Bates was one of the two plaintiffs of the Scottsboro Boys case, who later tried to recant her original testimony during the Patterson trial.|$|E
