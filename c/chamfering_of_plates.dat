40|$|Abstract — This paper {{explores the}} {{description}} of special purpose unit made from a cylindrical grinding attachment of lathe machine to perform chamfering and deburring operation on workpieces <b>of</b> various sizes. <b>Chamfering</b> and deburring operations are necessary for many industrial products {{in order to keep}} the edges from being damaged and also to remove sharp edges. The other advantages <b>of</b> <b>chamfering</b> and deburring are high quality finish of the product, safer material handling, increased personal safety. Conventional methods used for these operations consume major machine setting time and also requires skill. Manufacturers are turning to special purpose units to achieve consistent results and to reduce other machine engagement times and to lower costs. Considering all the aspects, a special portable unit is made from existing grinding attachment. <b>Chamfer</b> <b>of</b> acceptable quality having required depth can be achieved. Angle can be set as 45 ° ± 15 °. The advantage of this unit in terms of reduction in process time and less skill while maintaining quality <b>of</b> <b>chamfer</b> is justified by practical trial observations...|$|R

Swaging a bearing into a housing means either flaring its groove's lips onto the <b>chamfer</b> <b>of</b> the housing, or flaring the housing's material over the edge of the bearing. The flaring is done with a pair of rolls that travel around the hole and are fed down into the part, deforming the metal in a controlled, predicted way.

40|$|Abstract – The {{end effect}} of a linear {{induction}} motor (LIM) {{has been known for}} several decades, es-pecially in high speed operation. The exit part of the primary is not dealt as extensively as the entry part because of its minor effect.

In this paper, the concept of the virtual primary core is intro-duced, and <b>chamfering</b> <b>of</b> the primary outlet teeth is proposed to minimize the longitudinal end effect at the exit zone. For this, LIM for the high-speed train is designed and analyzed by using finite element method. Results confirm that chamfering can improve thrust performance effectively...|$|R
