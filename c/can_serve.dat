5|$|Like rhenium and palladium, {{technetium}} <b>can</b> <b>serve</b> as a catalyst. In {{processes such as}} the dehydrogenation of isopropyl alcohol, it is a {{far more}} effective catalyst than either rhenium or palladium. However, its radioactivity is a major problem in safe catalytic applications.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{are raised}} {{for a wide}} variety of products, principally meat, wool, milk, and eggs, but also {{including}} tallow, isinglass and rennet. Animals are also kept for more specialised purposes, such as to produce vaccines and antiserum (containing antibodies) for medical use. Where fodder or other crops are grown alongside animals, manure <b>can</b> <b>serve</b> as a fertiliser, returning minerals and organic matter to the soil in a semi-closed organic system.|$|E

5|$|Because of its Red Line connection, Porter Square <b>can</b> <b>serve</b> as a {{temporary}} inbound terminus for the Fitchburg Line service when commuter rail service is disrupted between Porter and Boston's North Station. It served this role during the 2004 Democratic National Convention, when North Station was closed for a week for security purposes, and during Green Line Extension construction in 2015 and 2017.|$|E
5|$|In nuclear reactors, 10B is {{used for}} {{reactivity}} control and in emergency shutdown systems. It <b>can</b> <b>serve</b> either function {{in the form of}} borosilicate control rods or as boric acid. In pressurized water reactors, boric acid is added to the reactor coolant when the plant is shut down for refueling. It is then slowly filtered out over many months as fissile material is used up and the fuel becomes less reactive.|$|E
5|$|In {{parts of}} its range, {{such as the}} Harboi, these steppe {{ecosystems}} are employed as rangeland for grazing animals such as sheep and goats, although this forage is generally of poor nutritional quality. P.atriplicifolia <b>can</b> <b>serve</b> as {{an important source of}} phosphorus and zinc, despite being high in poorly-digested material such as neutral detergent fiber and lignin.|$|E

5|$|Riesling {{is almost}} never {{fermented}} or aged in new oak (although large old oak barrels {{are often used}} to store and stabilize Riesling based wines in Germany and Alsace). This means that Riesling tends to be lighter weight and therefore suitable to {{a wider range of}} foods. The sharp acidity/sweetness in Rieslings <b>can</b> <b>serve</b> as a good balance to foods that have a high salt content. In Germany, cabbage is sometimes cooked with riesling to reduce the vegetable's smell.|$|E
5|$|The M.A. {{concentration}} in Pastoral Care and Counseling <b>can</b> <b>serve</b> as an excellent path of study {{for those who}} support {{the life of the}} congregation, desire a career in pastoral counseling in a non-profit agency, or who envision chaplaincy – in fields such as health care, corrections, community or the military – as an expression of their call to ministry.|$|E
5|$|The condor's {{head and}} neck have few feathers, and {{the skin of the}} {{head and neck}} is capable of {{flushing}} noticeably in response to emotional state, a capability that <b>can</b> <b>serve</b> as communication between individuals. The skin color varies from yellowish to a glowing reddish-orange. The birds do not have true syringeal vocalizations. They can make a few hissing or grunting sounds only heard when very close.|$|E

5|$|According {{to general}} relativity, a binary system will emit {{gravitational}} waves, thereby losing energy. Due to this loss, {{the distance between}} the two orbiting bodies decreases, and so does their orbital period. Within the Solar System or for ordinary double stars, the effect is too small to be observable. This is not the case for a close binary pulsar, a system of two orbiting neutron stars, one of which is a pulsar: from the pulsar, observers on Earth receive a regular series of radio pulses that <b>can</b> <b>serve</b> as a highly accurate clock, which allows precise measurements of the orbital period. Because neutron stars are immensely compact, significant amounts of energy are emitted in the form of gravitational radiation.|$|E
5|$|All {{elephants}} {{have several}} distinctive features, {{the most notable}} {{of which is a}} long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water, and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which <b>can</b> <b>serve</b> as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.|$|E
5|$|All known {{isotopes}} of curium are radioactive {{and have}} a small critical mass for a sustained nuclear chain reaction. They predominantly emit α-particles, and the heat released in this process <b>can</b> <b>serve</b> as a heat source in radioisotope thermoelectric generators, but this application is hindered by the scarcity, high cost, and radioactivity of curium isotopes. Curium is used in production of heavier actinides and of the 238Pu radionuclide for power sources in artificial pacemakers. It served as the α-source in the alpha particle X-ray spectrometers installed on several space probes, including the Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity Mars rovers and the Philae lander on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, to analyze the composition {{and structure of the}} surface.|$|E

5|$|Federal law {{states that}} {{national}} parks {{will have the}} same underage laws as the state that they are located in, and the Assimilative Crimes Act is applicable to New Jersey's underage drinking statute. Thus, in a private location, such as a cabin in a federal enclave in New Jersey, a parent <b>can</b> <b>serve</b> alcohol to their child, and an underage person can possess and consume alcohol. Outside of these exceptions, underage drinking and serving alcohol to a minor are federal misdemeanors, punishable by a fine and up to 6 months in jail. There is a five-year statute of limitations for DUI, underage drinking, and other alcohol violations that take place in federal enclaves.|$|E
5|$|If {{the player}} chooses the dark side, Starkiller kills Darth Vader. The Emperor then offers to let Starkiller take Vader's place as his {{apprentice}} if Starkiller proves himself by killing Kota. Starkiller instead attacks the Emperor, who effortlessly crushes Starkiller with the Rogue Shadow, severely injuring him and killing Kota, Juno, and the Senators. The story ends with Starkiller's broken body being grafted with armor so he <b>can</b> <b>serve</b> as the Emperor's assassin, though Palpatine assures Starkiller that he, like Vader, will be cast aside {{when he finds}} a new apprentice. The Infinities expansion content builds on this ending.|$|E
5|$|In the Republic of India, a chief {{minister}} {{is the head}} of government of each of twenty-nine states and two union territories (Delhi and Puducherry). According to the Constitution of India, at the state-level, the governor is de jure head, but de facto executive authority rests with the chief minister. Following elections to the state legislative assembly, the governor usually invites the party (or coalition) with a majority of seats to form the government. The governor appoints the chief minister, whose council of ministers are collectively responsible to the assembly. Given he has the assembly's confidence, the chief minister's term is usually for a maximum of five years; there are no limits to the number of terms he/she <b>can</b> <b>serve.</b>|$|E

5|$|It isn't a {{personal}} pain which has brought me here, {{as is the}} case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth <b>can</b> <b>serve</b> as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact that I was able to travel here.|$|E
5|$|Many fungi <b>can</b> <b>serve</b> as {{source of}} food for insect larvae, whereas most insects eat fungi only occasionally. Still, {{a whole range of}} insect species {{specialize}} on fungi. These animals are mainly beetle larvae, especially hairy fungus beetles (Mycetophagidae), rove beetles (Staphylinidae), and true flies (Diptera). Milk caps are especially attractive for true flies, while beetle larvae are comparatively rarer. The most common insects found on the fungus are Mycetophilidae and Phoridae larvae, which populate even the youngest fruit bodies. Also relatively common on mature or overaged fruit bodies are Drosophilidae and Psychodidae. Species from the section Deliciosi are often infested by Diptera larvae.|$|E
5|$|Morphologically, {{the dark}} colour of the gills and stem, {{lack of a}} strong taste, and {{characters}} of the cystidia (large cells found on the mushrooms) are the most distinguishing characteristics of X.setulipes. These features allow the species to be readily distinguished from other, similar species, including X.cauticinalis and X.brunneola. Its ecology and habitat are also distinct, but {{it is unclear whether}} they <b>can</b> <b>serve</b> as certain identifying characteristics. Within the genus Xeromphalina, X.setulipes is classified in the section Mutabiles, along with several other species. It seems most closely related to X.fraxinophila, X.cornui, X.campanelloides and X.cauticinalis, but, according to Esteve-Raventós and colleagues, further analysis is required to accurately judge the relationships between the species of Xeromphalina.|$|E
