5|$|After {{events in}} Munich, Jennings {{continued}} {{to report on}} Middle East issues. In 1973, he covered the Yom Kippur War, and the following year, he served as chief <b>correspondent</b> <b>and</b> co-producer of Sadat: Action Biography, a profile of Egyptian president Anwar Sadat that would win him his first of two George Foster Peabody Awards. The documentary established Jennings as Sadat's favorite correspondent. That summer, Jennings married {{for the second time}} to Anouchka Malouf, a Lebanese photographer. His first wife was childhood sweetheart Valerie Godsoe.|$|E
5|$|During his lifetime, he also {{explored}} territory {{never seen}} before by white man, played cricket at first-class level, including on overseas tours, wrote short stories and novels (one of which {{was turned into a}} Douglas Fairbanks film) and was a successful newspaper <b>correspondent</b> <b>and</b> travel writer. His many activities brought him into the highest social and professional circles. Like other turn of the century hunters such as Teddy Roosevelt, he was an active campaigner for animal welfare and succeeded in seeing legal measures introduced for their protection.|$|E

5|$|His role {{in shaping}} North Korean {{literature}} was to be pivotal. Cho's early works Mt. Paektu (MR: Paektusan, 1947) and Land (MR: Ttang, 1946) would point out the direction that North Korean literature was about to take. These works would soon become models for North Korean literature. Upon his return, he started writing for Chosŏn Sinmun, the Soviet Red Army's Korean-language paper, working as a <b>correspondent</b> <b>and</b> translator. He translated works of such Soviet poets as Mayakovsky, Gribachev, and Jambyl Jabayev.|$|E
5|$|In 1996 {{he became}} a {{political}} correspondent, presenting Weekend Breakfast and Late Night Live on BBC Radio 5 Live, and in 1997 he covered the general election for BBC Radio. In October 1999 he became BBC News 24's chief political <b>correspondent,</b> <b>and</b> also presented Westminster Live. In {{the run-up to the}} 2001 general election, Robinson started keeping a daily diary of the campaign. Entitled The Campaign Today, it later became Newslog, and continued to be updated until Robinson left the BBC. When he returned in 2005 he began a new blog with the same name.|$|E

5|$|He {{grew up in}} the Uranienborg {{neighbourhood}} in the West End of Oslo, {{and enrolled}} at the Royal Frederick University in 1933. Following law studies, he graduated in 1939 with a cand.jur. degree, and travelled to the United States to study at Columbia University in New York. From 1940 to 1945, during the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, he was employed at the Norwegian general consulate in New York City. He worked as a foreign affairs journalist for the conservative newspaper Aftenposten from 1946 to 1948 and for the Norwegian News Agency from 1949 to 1953. He was a press attaché for the Norwegian United Nations delegation in 1953 and 1954. After that, he was stationed in New York as a foreign <b>correspondent</b> <b>and</b> radio chronicler for Norway.|$|E
5|$|Jennings {{returned}} to the U.S. {{at the end of}} 1974 to become Washington <b>correspondent</b> <b>and</b> news anchor for ABC's new morning program AM America, a predecessor to Good Morning America. ABC was hoping that the show, in which it had invested $8 million, would challenge NBC's highly popular Today. AM America debuted on January 6, 1975, with Jennings delivering regular newscasts from Washington. The show never gained ground against Today, and was canceled in just ten months. In November 1975, Jennings moved abroad, this time as ABC's chief foreign correspondent. He continued to cover the Middle East, and in 1978 he was the first Canadian or American reporter to interview the Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran, then in exile in Paris.|$|E

5|$|During {{the years}} when the Gilbert and Sullivan operas were being written, Richard D'Oyly Carte also {{produced}} operas and plays by other writing teams, {{as well as other}} works to fill the Savoy Theatre in between new operas. Many of these were companion pieces to the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, as the Victorian audiences preferred long evenings in the theatre. Some, however, were new full-length pieces either for the Savoy or for Carte's touring companies, which toured the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, and these new works, extensively. Carte and Lenoir also continued to run his management agency. As an example of their level of activity, an 1881 souvenir programme commemorating the 250th performance of Patience in London and its 100th performance in New York states that, in addition to these two productions of Patience, Carte was simultaneously producing many other projects. These included two companies touring with Patience, two touring with other Gilbert and Sullivan operas, one touring with the operetta Olivette (co-produced with Charles Wyndham), one with Claude Duval in America, a production of Youth running at a New York theatre, a lecture tour by Archibald Forbes (a war <b>correspondent)</b> <b>and</b> productions of Patience, Pirates, Claude Duval and Billee Taylor in association with J. C. Williamson in Australia, among other things.|$|E
5|$|Richard Nevinson {{was born}} in Hampstead, {{one of the two}} children, and the only son, of the war <b>correspondent</b> <b>and</b> {{journalist}} Henry Nevinson and the suffrage campaigner and writer Margaret Nevinson. Educated at Uppingham School, which he hated, Nevinson went on to study at the St John's Wood School of Art. Inspired by seeing the work of Augustus John, he decided to attend the Slade School of Art, part of University College, London. There his contemporaries included Mark Gertler, Stanley Spencer, Paul Nash, Maxwell Gordon Lightfoot, Adrian Allinson and Dora Carrington. Gertler was, for a time, his closest friend and influence, and they formed for a short while a group known as the Neo-Primitives, being deeply influenced by the art of the early Renaissance. Gertler and Nevinson subsequently fell out when they both fell in love with Carrington. Whilst at the Slade, Nevinson was advised by the Professor of Drawing, Henry Tonks, to abandon thoughts of an artistic career. This led to a lifelong bitterness between the two, and frequent accusations by Nevinson, who had something of a persecution complex, that Tonks was behind several imagined conspiracies against him.|$|E
