5|$|As {{with the}} {{chemical}} antioxidants, cells are protected against oxidative stress by an interacting network of antioxidant enzymes. Here, the superoxide released by {{processes such as}} oxidative phosphorylation is first converted to hydrogen peroxide and then further reduced to give water. This detoxification pathway {{is the result of}} multiple enzymes, with superoxide dismutases catalysing the first step and then catalases and various peroxidases removing hydrogen peroxide. As with antioxidant metabolites, the contributions of these enzymes to antioxidant defenses <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to separate from one another, but the generation of transgenic mice lacking just one antioxidant enzyme can be informative.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} storm petrels {{are found}} in the northern hemisphere although some species around the equator dip into the south. They are strictly pelagic, coming to land only when breeding. In the case of most species, little is known of their behaviour and distribution at sea, where they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to find and harder to identify. They are colonial nesters, displaying strong philopatry to their natal colonies and nesting sites. Most species nest in crevices or burrows and all but one species attend the breeding colonies nocturnally. Pairs form long-term monogamous bonds and share incubation and chick-feeding duties. Like many species of seabird, nesting is highly protracted with incubation taking up to 50 days and fledging another 70 days after that.|$|E

25|$|His art <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to categorize, as he {{explored}} many different styles and techniques. Kraljević's graphic work displays strong tonal qualities {{and an excellent}} sense {{of light and dark}} relationships, perfectly suiting a sensitive temperament which could express extreme joy, but soon transform into deepest melancholy.|$|E
25|$|Identifying the {{characteristics}} of contemporary or postmodern art within Croatia <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to specify. Some common features are geometrizing and symbolic-metaphoric paintings, sculptures and installations. Some {{of the best known}} contemporary artists are painters Julije Knifer, Edo Murtić, Oton Gliha, and sculptor Ivan Kožarić.|$|E
25|$|When {{flying at}} high altitudes, {{spotting}} migrating butterflies or moths <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard.</b> Low flying species are easily spotted or caught using a light trap. When individuals fly {{too high for}} these methods, air balloons equipped with nets are used at times. Alternatively, radar is used to monitor migration.|$|E

25|$|Elaborate haloes and {{especially}} aureoles also appear in Hindu sculpture, where {{they tend to}} develop into architectural frames in which the original idea <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to recognise. Theravada Buddhism and Jainism {{did not use the}} halo for many centuries, but later adopted it, though less thoroughly than other religious groups.|$|E
25|$|Vertebral fractures, {{while having}} a smaller impact on mortality, {{can lead to}} a severe chronic pain of neurogenic origin, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to control, as well as deformity. Though rare, {{multiple}} vertebral fractures can lead to such severe hunch back (kyphosis), the resulting pressure on internal organs can impair one's ability to breathe.|$|E
25|$|Similarly with {{developmental}} dyslexia, {{there has been}} considerable interest in the idea that for some children reading problems are downstream consequences of difficulties in rapid auditory processing. Again, cause and effect <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to unravel. This {{is one reason why}} experts such as Moore have recommended using non-verbal auditory tests to diagnose APD.|$|E
5000|$|The system <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> to design, {{requiring}} both [...] "SPDT" [...] thermostats or relays and {{the ability}} of the system to withstand the fault condition whereby all zone valves are closed simultaneously.|$|R
5000|$|Changes to stored {{procedures}} <b>are</b> <b>harder</b> to {{keep track}} of within a version control system than other code. Changes must be reproduced as scripts to be stored in the project history to be included, and differences in procedures <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> to merge and track correctly.|$|R

25|$|Mercury {{thermometers}} {{and mercury}} light bulbs {{are not as}} common {{as they used to}} be, and the amount of mercury they contain is unlikely to be a health concern if handled carefully. However, broken items still require careful cleanup, as mercury <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to collect and it is easy to accidentally create a much larger exposure problem.|$|E
25|$|MIMO signal testing focuses {{first on}} the transmitter/receiver system. The random phases of the {{sub-carrier}} signals can produce instantaneous power levels that cause the amplifier to compress, momentarily causing distortion and ultimately symbol errors. Signals with a high PAR (peak-to-average ratio) can cause amplifiers to compress unpredictably during transmission. OFDM signals are very dynamic and compression problems <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to detect because of their noise-like nature.|$|E
50|$|For more {{expressive}} formalisms, {{this problem}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder,</b> or even undecidable. For a Turing complete formalism, such as arbitrary formal grammars, not only this problem, but every nontrivial property regarding {{the set of}} strings they describe is undecidable, a fact known as Rice's Theorem.|$|R
50|$|Quitting <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> for {{individuals}} with dark pigmented skin compared to individuals with pale skin since nicotine has an affinity for melanin-containing tissues. Studies suggest this can cause the phenomenon of increased nicotine dependence and lower smoking cessation rate in darker pigmented individuals.|$|R
50|$|The {{hardness}} {{of synthetic}} diamond (70-150 GPa) is very {{dependent on the}} relative purity of the crystal itself. The more perfect the crystal structure, the harder the diamond becomes. It has recently been reported that HPHT single crystals and nanocrystalline diamond aggregates (aggregated diamond nanorods) <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> than natural diamond.|$|R
25|$|Wave {{breaking}} intensity {{measures the}} force of the wave as it breaks, spills, or plunges (a plunging wave is termed by surfers as a “barrel wave”). Wave section length is the distance between two breaking crests in a wave set. Wave section length <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to measure because local winds, non-linear wave interactions, island sheltering, and swell interactions can cause multifarious wave configurations in the surf zone.|$|E
25|$|Compensatory damages {{are also}} available. AC 932] House of Lords (United Kingdom) Accounts of profits <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> {{remedies}} to establish, therefore, a plaintiff will often seek compensation (damages) instead. Courts of equity initially {{had no power}} to award compensatory damages, which traditionally were a remedy at common law, but legislation and case law has changed the situation so compensatory damages may now be awarded for a purely equitable action.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the anxiety and fear that typically accompanies OCD, sufferers may spend hours performing such compulsions every day. In such situations, it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> for the person to fulfil their work, family or social roles. In some cases, these behaviors can also cause adverse physical symptoms. For example, people who obsessively wash their hands with antibacterial soap and hot water can make their skin red and raw with dermatitis.|$|E
50|$|This {{additional}} {{relationship can}} have severe consequences, since {{in some cases}} the performance standard can have major contribution to pressure exerted on individuals deciding whether to make the investment. With the slowing action actively undermining the performance standard, it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> to find the incentive to invest into additional resources.|$|R

50|$|Although more {{informative}} than box plots, {{a disadvantage}} of violin plots {{is that they}} are less popular. Because of their unpopularity, their meaning <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> to grasp for many readers not familiar with the violin plot representation. In this case, a more accessible alternative <b>can</b> <b>be</b> plotting a series of stacked histograms or Kernel density distributions.|$|R
25|$|In Asia, the Asian tiger {{mosquito}} can {{be mistaken for}} {{other members of the}} subgenus Stegomyia, particularly the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti (the most prevalent species in the tropics and subtropics), because both species display a similar black and white pattern. It <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to distinguish Ae. albopictus from the closely related Aedes scutellaris (India, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines), Aedes pseudoalbopictus (India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam) and Aedes seatoi (Thailand).|$|E
25|$|Any {{stimulus}} {{that increases}} the likelihood of a behavior increasing is a reinforcer. An effective use of positive reinforcement would be frequent praise while an employee is learning a new task. An employee's behavior can also be shaped during the learning process if approximations of the ideal behavior are praised or rewarded. The frequency of reinforcement is an important consideration. While frequent praise during the learning process can be beneficial, it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to sustain indefinitely.|$|E
25|$|Femoral hernias occur {{just below}} the {{inguinal}} ligament, when abdominal contents pass into the weak area at the posterior wall of the femoral canal. They <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to distinguish from the inguinal type (especially when ascending cephalad): however, they generally appear more rounded, and, in contrast to inguinal hernias, {{there is a strong}} female preponderance in femoral hernias. The incidence of strangulation in femoral hernias is high. Repair techniques are similar for femoral and inguinal hernia.|$|E
