The weather changed suddenly as the squall line approached, with a strong northeast wind developing against an outgoing tide. The wind has been estimated at 25 to 35 mph (40 to 56 km/hr) and the waves as high as 15 feet (4.6 meters) in the rip tides near Montauk Point. While rounding Montauk Point at approximately 2:00 PM, Pelican was hit by two successive waves on the starboard quarter and capsized to port, spilling most of her passengers and crew into the water while trapping others inside the <b>cabin.</b> The <b>vessel</b> then foundered.

In the first place, it was necessary to get a permit to go on board the ship.

40|$|Copyright © 2009 SAE International Leak {{detection}} of vehicle cabin interiors {{is an important}} quality inspection phase that typically has been handled with various time consuming, or potentially product damaging techniques. Leak detection in tank or pressure vessel applications is almost always a concern for gas or fluid containment in vehicles and in many other industries. Numerous techniques exist for the {{detection of}} leaks in these and other types of structures. When testing is required in a production environment, often the speed of leak detection is very important if all samples must be tested. The use of several ultrasound based methods for leak detection in vehicle <b>cabins</b> and pressure <b>vessel</b> applications is presented here. Ultrasound waves are typically classified as having spectral content greater than 20 kHz. In the case of leak detection in a production environment, frequently the ultrasonic spectrum is largely free from background noise content that dominates the audible spectrum. The method for the response measurement of ultrasonic signals presented here is with the implementation of high frequency microphones. The excitation methods presented here are an active method utilizing an ultrasonic emitter, a passive method relying on the passing of air through leak locations, and a vibro-acoustic method utilizing a small electro-dynamic shaker. The methods presented here have been tested for the existence of leaks in some structures, but have not been tested in this paper for the existence flaws and defects that may potentially lead to leaks in some structures after prolonged use...|$|R

He immediately went with his family on board of the vessel commanded by the Adelantado, and, sending back the damaged ship to port, continued on his course. Throughout the voyage he experienced the most tempestuous weather. In one storm the mainmast was sprung in four places. He was confined to his bed at the time by the gout; by his advice, however, and {{the activity of the}} Adelantado, the damage was skillfully repaired; the mast was shortened; the weak parts were fortified by wood taken from the castles or <b>cabins</b> which the <b>vessels</b> in those days carried on the prow and stern; and the whole was well secured by cords.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the field {{measurement}} and evaluation of the indoor thermal environment in air-conditioned <b>vessel</b> <b>cabins.</b> Questionnaires were col-lected in this study to appraise thermal sensation vote (TSV) of crews and passengers in specific ship cabins environment during a hot season. Predicted mean vote (PMV) was calculated based on the field environmental data. The neutral temperature was 22. 6 C for passen-gers, 22. 9 C for the working crews and 20. 9 C for resting crews based on calculation using TSV regres-sion. From PMV regression, the neutral temperature was 24. 0 C for passengers, 25. 1 C for working crew and 24. 7 C for resting crew. Predicted neutral temperature from PMV {{is higher than the}} neutral temperature from TSV. Human factors of crew, metabolism rate and clothing insulation were reasonably modified in order to minimise the differences between TSV and PMV and predict PMV accurately. Investigation of the thermal preference and productivity of the crews were also carried out during the field experiment. The results showed that female subjects or elderly subjects (above 40) preferred working in warmer environment and that neutral temperature can not ensure high productivity. Therefore, variance exists between thermal sensation and thermal preference. From the field data analysis, productivity of the crew in slightly cool or slightly warm environment was higher than that in the environment with neutral temperature. Productivity is 101. 7 % when TSV is 0 and reaches the peak of 105. 1 % in slightly cool environment. A TSV-Productivity polynomial regres-sion equation was established based on field investiga-tion data...|$|R
60|$|A {{thing of}} this sort, once decided on, is easily enough put in {{execution}} in America. Among Mark's college friends was {{one who was}} {{a few years older than}} himself, and who had entered the ministry. This young man was then acting as a sort of missionary among the seamen of the port, and he had fallen in the way of the young lover the very first day of his return to his ship. It was an easy matter to work on the good nature of this easy-minded man, who, on hearing of the ill treatment offered to his friend, was willing enough to perform the ceremony. Everything being previously arranged, Mark and Bridget were married, early one morning, during the time the latter was out, in company with a female friend of about her own age, to take what her aunt believed was her customary walk before breakfast. Philadelphia, in 1796, was not the town it is to-day. It then lay, almost entirely, on the shores of the Delaware, those of the Schuylkill being completely in the country. What was more, the best quarters were still near the river, and the distance between the Rancocus--meaning Mark's ship, and not the creek of that name--and the house of Bridget's aunt, was but trifling. The ceremony took place in the <b>cabin</b> of the <b>vessel</b> just named, which, now that the captain was ashore in his own house, Mark had all to himself, no second-mate having been shipped, and which was by no means an inappropriate place for the nuptials of a pair like that which our young people turned out to be, in the end.|$|R

40|$|Public {{means of}} {{transport}} have been the object of numerous terrorist attacks, {{mainly because of the}} high concentration of passengers, the criticality of mobility in modern society and the difficulties in applying effective screening or other protection measures. Video surveillance {{is one of the major}} instruments to increase security. However, in the case of managing emergencies following major accidents or security events, classical CCTV based surveillance is of little use, apart from forensic investigations. The main issues are related to: • The time and resources needed to process the huge amounts of information accumulated during the 24 / 7 CCTV operations. • The cost of maintaining such centralised infrastructures. • The threat (or perception of threat) to personal data and privacy from the continuous acquisition, transmission and storage of video streams. ASPIS is a novel smart surveillance system that was conceived soon after the London bombing events in order to answer the above issues. It is a scalable, modular, surveillance / alarm system designed to provide prompt, complete, pertinent information for the management of emergency situations in public {{means of transport}} without compromising citizen’s right to privacy. In fact, it records and transmits information only on the occurrence of an emergency event. Three operational scenarios have been developed and tested: 1. Underground metro / suburban rail: on-board surveillance, on-board explosion / gunshots 2. Ferry or cruise vessel: monitoring <b>cabin</b> occupancy under <b>vessel</b> evacuation conditions 3. Ferry or cruise vessel: monitoring doors / accesses to sensitive rooms / spaces The ASPIS project, financed from the EC under the FP 7 -SST scheme, started on June 2008 and concluded on March 2012.

60|$|Bridget {{was almost}} {{overcome}} {{when she got}} on board the ship. There was even a certain sublimity in the solitude that reigned over everything, that impressed her imagination, and she wondered that any human being could so long have dwelt there alone, uncheered by the hope of deliverance. In the <b>cabin</b> of that <b>vessel</b> she had plighted her faith to Mark, and a flood of recollections burst upon her as she entered it. Mark was obliged {{to allow her to}} seek relief in tears. But, half an hour brought her round again, and then she set about putting things in order, and making this very important abode submit to the influence of woman's love of comfort and order. By the time Mark came back from his garden, whither he had gone to ascertain its condition, Bridget had his supper ready for him, prepared with a neatness and method to which he had long been a stranger. That was a very delicious meal to both. The husband had lighted a fire in the galley, where the wife had cooked the meal, which consisted principally of some pan-fish, taken in the narrow channels between the rocks, and which had been cleaned by Mark himself, as they sailed along. It was, indeed, a great point of solicitude with this young husband to prevent his charming wife from performing duties for which she was unfitted by education, while the wife herself was only too solicitous to make herself useful. In one sense, Bridget was a very knowing person about a household. She knew how to prepare many savoury compounds, and had the whole culinary art at her fingers' ends, in the way of giving directions. It was no wonder, then, that Mark found everything she touched, or prepared, good, as everything she said sounded pleasant and reasonable. The last is a highly important ingredient in matrimonial life, but the first has its merit. And Bridget Woolston was both pleasant and reasonable. Though a little romantic, and inclined to hazard all for feeling, and what she conceived to be duty, at the bottom of all ran a vein of excellent sense, which had been reasonably attended to. Her temper was sweetness itself, {{and that is one of}} the greatest requisites in married happiness. To this great quality must be added affection, for she was devoted to Mark, and nothing he wished would she hesitate about striving to obtain, even at painful sacrifices to herself. One as generous-minded and manly as her husband, could not fail to discover and appreciate such a disposition, which entered very largely into the composition of their future happiness.|$|R
6000|$|An earnest {{desire to}} {{ameliorate}} {{the situation of}} those who were doomed to meet death on the great deep had induced an experienced and simple- hearted divine to accept this station, in the fond hope that he might be made the favored instrument of salvation to many, who were then existing in a state of the most abandoned self-forgetfulness. Neither our limits, nor our present object, will permit the relation of the many causes that led, not only to an entire frustration of all his visionary expectations, but to an issue which rendered the struggle of the good divine with himself both arduous and ominous, in order to maintain his own claims to the merited distinctions of his sacred office. The consciousness of his backsliding had so far lessened the earthly, if not the spiritual, pride of the chaplain, as to induce him to relish the society of the rude master, whose years had brought him, at times, to take certain views of futurity that were singularly affected by the peculiar character of the individual. It might have been that both found themselves out of their places--but it was owing to some such secret sympathy, let its origin be what it would, that the two came to be fond of each other's company. On the night in question, Mr. Boltrope had invited the chaplain to accompany him in the Alacrity; adding, in his broad, rough language, that as there was to be fighting on shore, [...] "his hand might come in play with some poor fellow or other." [...] This singular invitation had been accepted, as well from a desire to relieve the monotony of a sea-life by any change, as perhaps with a secret yearning in the breast of the troubled divine to get as nigh to terra firma as possible. Accordingly, after the Pilot had landed with his boisterous party, the sailing-master and the chaplain, together with a boatswain's mate and some ten or twelve seamen, were left in quiet possession of the cutter. The first few hours of this peaceable intercourse had been spent by the worthy messmates, in the little <b>cabin</b> of the <b>vessel,</b> over a can of grog; the savory relish of which was much increased by a characteristic disquisition on polemical subjects, which our readers have great reason to regret it is not our present humor to record. When, however, the winds invited the near approach to the hostile shores already mentioned, the prudent sailing-master adjourned the discussion to another and more suitable time, removing himself and the can, by the same operation, to the quarter-deck.|$|R
