Foram obtidas 60 fotografias faciais da amostra selecionada, 30 do perfil direito e 30 do perfil esquerdo. Essas fotografias foram avaliadas subjetivamente por 25 examinadores divididos em 5 categorias de acordo com sua área de atuação profissional: 5 ortodontistas e 5 cirurgiões plásticos atuantes na reabilitação de fissuras no HRAC, 5 ortodontistas e 5 cirurgiões plásticos inexperientes na área de fissuras e 5 leigos com formação superior. Por meio de notas que variavam de 1 a 9, os perfis faciais foram classificados em 3 categorias, esteticamente desagradável (notas de 1 a 3), esteticamente aceitável (notas de 4 a 6) e esteticamente agradável (notas de 7 a 9). Os resultados mostraram que os perfis faciais dos pacientes foram classificados em esteticamente aceitáveis, com variações entre as categorias de examinadores. Os profissionais do HRAC, por conhecerem as limitações que o processo de reabilitação impõe aos indivíduos com fissuras, foram os mais condescendentes no julgamento estético. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} esthetically the facial profile of 30 adult Caucasian unilateral cleft lip and palate (CLP) patients, without syndromes, of both genders, with ages ranging from 17 years 3 months to 30 years 9 months (mean age = 23 years 3 months), rehabilitated at the Hospital for Rehabilitation of Craniofacial Anomalies (HRACUSP). Sixty profile photographs of the selected sample were taken, 30 of the right profile and 30 of the profile. These photographs were subjectively evaluated by 25 examiners divided into 5 categories according to their professional activity: 5 orthodontists and 5 plastic surgeons dealing with CLP, 5 orthodontists and 5 plastic surgeons without experience in the <b>CLP</b> <b>field</b> and 5 laymen by means of scores that ranged from 1 to 9, the facial profiles were classified into 3 categories: esthetically unpleasant (scores 1 to 3) esthetically acceptable (scores 4 to 6) and esthetically pleasant (scores 7 to 9). The findings showed that the patients facial profiles were classified as esthetically acceptable, with variations among the categories of examiners. The examiners of the HRAC gave the best scores in the esthetic judgement due to their Knowledge of limitations related to the rehabilitation process...|$|E

Although {{a relatively new}} <b>field,</b> <b>CLP</b> has progressed in several quite different directions. In particular, the early fundamental concepts have been adapted to better serve in different areas of applications. In this survey of CLP, a primary goal is to give a systematic description of the major trends in terms of common fundamental concepts. The three main parts cover the theory, implementation issues, and programming for applications...|$|R
