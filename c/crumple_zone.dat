500|$|A {{lightweight}} steel (not aluminium) {{structure and}} a rear-engined layout allowed Mitsubishi to incorporate a larger front <b>crumple</b> <b>zone,</b> {{in order to}} meet current safety legislation requirements without compromising interior space. With no powertrain in front of the driver, the designers were able to shorten the front overhang and lengthen the wheelbase to , giving greater legroom for passengers than many comparable kei cars whose wheelbase is typically [...] less. The downside of this design was a reduction in cargo-carrying capacity, which was necessarily compromised by the engine's location in the rear.|$|E
2500|$|Another key {{focus of}} the project was the {{protection}} provided by a replaceable [...] sacrificial [...] "blast wedge" [...] that is bolted {{to the bottom of the}} vehicle. Constructed from welded steel armor, it absorbs and deflects energy from a blast, acting as a <b>crumple</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Model S {{is notable}} for being {{designed}} solely {{with an electric}} powertrain in mind, unlike other vehicles where the manufacturer has simply swapped out or supplanted an internal combustion engine with an electric motor. As a result, the Model S is able to offer unique features such as a front trunk, 'frunk', {{in addition to a}} spacious rear trunk (with a total cargo volume of [...] ) and a greatly enlarged front <b>crumple</b> <b>zone</b> compared to the typical combustion engine powered vehicle.|$|E
50|$|A {{misconception}} about <b>crumple</b> <b>zones</b> sometimes voiced is {{that they}} reduce safety for the occupants of the vehicle by allowing the body to collapse, therefore risking crushing the occupants. In fact, <b>crumple</b> <b>zones</b> are typically located in front of and behind {{the main body of}} the car (which forms a rigid 'safety cell'), compacting within the space of the engine compartment or boot/trunk. Modern vehicles using what are commonly termed 'crumple zones' provide far superior protection for their occupants in severe tests against other vehicles with <b>crumple</b> <b>zones</b> and solid static objects than older models or SUVs that use a separate chassis frame and have no <b>crumple</b> <b>zones.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Crumple</b> <b>zones</b> {{absorb and}} {{dissipate}} {{the force of}} a collision, displacing and diverting it away from the passenger compartment and reducing the negative acceleration impact force on the vehicle occupants. Vehicles will include a front, rear and maybe side <b>crumple</b> <b>zones</b> (like Volvo SIPS) too.|$|R

2500|$|The 2CV was {{produced}} for 42 years, the model finally succumbing to customer demands for speed, {{in which this}} ancient design had fallen significantly behind modern cars, and safety. Although {{the front of the}} chassis was designed to fold up, to form a <b>crumple</b> <b>zone</b> according to a 1984 Citroën brochure, in common with other small cars of its era its crashworthiness was very poor by modern standards. (The drive for improved safety in Europe happened from the 1990s onwards, and accelerated with the 1997 advent of Euro NCAP.) Its advanced underlying engineering was ignored or misunderstood by the public, being clothed in an anachronistic body. It was the butt of many a joke, especially by Jasper Carrott in the UK.|$|E
2500|$|The initial {{tests of}} the Ford Excursion were [...] "horrifying" [...] {{for its ability to}} vault over the hood of a Ford Taurus. The big SUV was {{modified}} to include a type of blocker bar suggested by the French transportation ministry in 1971, a kind of under-vehicle roll bar designed to keep the large Ford Excursion from rolling over cars that were hit by it. The problem is [...] "impact incompatibility", where the [...] "hard points" [...] of the end of chassis rails of SUVs are higher than the [...] "hard points" [...] of cars, causing the SUV to override the engine compartment and <b>crumple</b> <b>zone</b> of the car. There have been few regulations covering designs of SUVs to address the safety issue. The problem of heavy weight is a risk factor present for very large passenger cars, not only with SUVs. The typically higher SUV bumper heights and those built using stiff truck-based frames, also increases risks in crashes with passenger cars. The Mercedes ML320 was designed with bumpers at the same height as required for passenger cars.|$|E
2500|$|The Smart Fortwo uses a {{very small}} front <b>crumple</b> <b>zone.</b> The second {{generation}} Smart Fortwo has been awarded 4 out of 5 stars in the Euro NCAP Adult Occupant Protection and 2 out of 4 stars in the Pedestrian protection test, but was not tested for Child Occupant Protection as it has no rear seats. The original Smart was awarded 3 out of 5 stars for Adult Occupant Protection. In American tests using a five-star rating, Smart cars received a four-star safety rating for the driver from a front impact, and a five-star safety rating for the driver for a side impact. [...] It also received [...] "Good" [...] ratings for front and side crash protection in Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) tests. [...] However, in an April 2009 40mph frontal offset crash test between a Fortwo and a Mercedes C-Class, [...] "the Smart went air-borne and turned around 450 degrees" [...] causing [...] "extensive intrusion into the space around the dummy from head to feet". The IIHS rated the Smart Fortwo [...] "Poor," [...] noting that [...] "Multiple injuries, including to the head, would be likely for a real-world driver of a smart in a similar collision." ...|$|E

50|$|The <b>crumple</b> <b>zone</b> is a {{structural}} feature mainly used in automobiles and recently incorporated into railcars.|$|E
50|$|For safety reasons {{all modern}} cars feature a {{collapsible}} steering column (energy absorbing steering column) which will collapse {{in the event of}} a heavy frontal impact to avoid excessive injuries to the driver. Airbags are also generally fitted as standard. Non-{{collapsible steering column}}s fitted to older vehicles very often impaled drivers in frontal crashes, particularly when the steering box or rack was mounted in front of the front axle line, at the front of the <b>crumple</b> <b>zone.</b> This was particularly a problem on vehicles that had a rigid separate chassis frame, with no <b>crumple</b> <b>zone.</b> Most modern vehicle steering boxes/racks are mounted behind the front axle on the front bulkhead, at the rear of the front <b>crumple</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E
50|$|Crash tested steel crates are {{designed}} specifically for use in hatchbacks and SUVs for pet vehicle transportation. They have special <b>crumple</b> <b>zones</b> designed {{to work with the}} <b>crumple</b> <b>zones</b> of the vehicles and absorb the impact of the accident and have been lab tested for safety. These crates are not intended for use on airplanes or for carrying pets outside of vehicles. They also do not make good housebreaking crates.|$|R
25|$|The crash {{structure}} was also improved, featuring side impact bars, a reinforced safety cage, improved <b>crumple</b> <b>zones,</b> front seat-belt pretensioners and airbags.|$|R

50|$|The W221 also {{contains}} many other safety features, including {{front and rear}} <b>crumple</b> <b>zones,</b> eight dual-stage air bags, anti-lock brakes (ABS), collapsible steering column, and traction control.|$|R

50|$|Standard safety {{features}} include dual front air bags, side impact air bags, and rear curtain airbags with rollover sensor, {{as well as}} Zone Body construction with front and rear <b>crumple</b> <b>zones.</b>|$|R
50|$|The C30 also {{features}} a four-wheel anti-lock braking system (ABS), electronic stability program (ESP), traction control system and front, side and curtain airbags, front and rear <b>crumple</b> <b>zones,</b> and a stiff occupant cell.|$|R
5000|$|Collapsible universally jointed {{steering}} columns, {{along with}} steering wheel airbag. The steering system is mounted {{behind the front}} axle - behind and protected by, the front <b>crumple</b> <b>zone.</b> This reduces the risk and severity of driver impact or even impalement on the column in a frontal crash.|$|E
50|$|A typical medical {{consequence}} of rear-ends, even {{in case of}} collisions at moderate speed, is whiplash. In more severe cases permanent injuries, e.g. herniation, may occur. The rearmost passengers in minivans benefit little from the short rear <b>crumple</b> <b>zone,</b> so {{they are more likely}} to be injured or killed in a rear-end collision.|$|E
50|$|The Land Rover LR2 Freelander, {{along with}} all Volvo models from 1998 on (including V8 models), employ a transversely-mounted engine in order to {{increase}} passenger space inside the vehicle. This has also allowed for improved safety in a frontal impact, due to more front to back engine compartment space being created. The result is a larger front <b>crumple</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E
50|$|When {{a vehicle}} is {{hit on the}} side by another vehicle, the <b>crumple</b> <b>zones</b> of the {{striking}} vehicle will absorb some of the kinetic energy of the collision. The <b>crumple</b> <b>zones</b> of the struck vehicle may also absorb some of the collision's energy, particularly if the vehicle is not struck on its passenger compartment. Both vehicles are frequently turned from their original directions of travel. If the collision is severe, the struck vehicle may be spun or rolled over, potentially causing it to strike other vehicles, objects, or pedestrians. After the collision, the involved vehicles may be stuck together by the folding of their parts around each other.|$|R
5000|$|With safety {{features}} such as <b>crumple</b> <b>zones,</b> rollover protection, a [...] "disappearing" [...] steering wheel, anti-lock braking system, automatic seat belts, airbags, pop-up head restraints, interior trim and reversing, or backup camera, the VESC attracted enormous attention.|$|R
25|$|The main {{structure}} of the car is a stiff structure, marketed as the Tridion Safety Cell, designed to activate the <b>crumple</b> <b>zones</b> of a colliding vehicle. This design creates a safety cell around the passengers, according to the manufacturer.|$|R
