This study aims {{to determine the}} effect of a <b>complete</b> <b>ration</b> of silage made from water hyacinth on feed efficiency and digestibility. This study uses fifteen rams (12 months old with an average body weight of 19 ± 3. 98 kg). The experimental was designed completely random. The sheeps were randomly divided into 3 treatments, and 4 replications. The sheeps wereted concentrate and fresh elephant grass (T 0), silage-based rations complete without the addition of starter hyacinth L. plantarum (T 1), and a <b>complete</b> <b>ration</b> silage made from water hyacinth by the addition of L. plantarum starter (T 2). Feed structured treatment isoenergi and isoprotein (PK 13 % and 65 % TDN). Feed treatment was given for 12 weeks with a 2 -week adaptation period. The results showed that feed intake, ADG, feed conversion, and feed efficiency were not significantly different (P> 0. 05), but it can improve feed digestibility (P < 0. 05) between treatments. Feed intake data, digestibility, ADG, feed conversion and feed efficiency at T 0, T 1 and T 2 as follows: 678. 27, 811. 43, 701. 21 g / day; 70. 51, 71. 74, 69. 82 %; 94. 09, 106. 34, 97. 28 g / day; 7. 22, 7. 66, and 7. 18; 14. 09, 13. 23 and 14. 02 % use a <b>complete</b> <b>ration</b> silage with L. plantarum starter better than the control treatment in the form of concentrates with elephant grass but not better than silage without a starter...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the use of L. plantarum starter on a <b>complete</b> <b>ration</b> silage made from water hyacinth on consumption of nitrogen free extract (NFE), partial volatile fatty acids (VFA) production, methane production, and blood glucose concentration of sheep. This study used ffteen rams (12 months old with an average body weight of 19 ?? 3. 98 kg). Sheep were randomly divided into 3 groups of treatment rations, namely the group given: concentrate ration and elephant grass (T 0), <b>complete</b> <b>ration</b> silage provided without the addition of L. plantarum starter (T 1), and <b>complete</b> <b>ration</b> silage provided {{with the addition of}} L. plantarum starter (T 2). Ration was formulated isocaloric and isoprotein (CP 13 %, TDN 65 %). The results showed that the consumption of NFE, the concentration of propionic acid, butyric acid and blood glucose before and post feeding was not signifcantly different, whereas the concentration of acetic acid, the ratio of C 2 :C 3 and methane production was signifcantly different (P< 0, 05) among treatments. The concentration of acetic acid of treatment T 0, T 1 and T 2 was 36. 52, 28. 86, and 32. 43 mM, respectively. Methane concentration was 19. 95, 16. 08, 17, 55 mM, respectively for T 0, T 1, T 2 and glucose concentration was 45. 50, 70. 30, and 53. 24 mg/dl, for treatment T 0, T 1, T 2, respectively. In conclusion, provision of silage ration complete which was provided with or and without L. plantarum starter was much better compared to control ration, (concentrates with elephant grass) ...|$|E
40|$|Prior to the {{initiation}} of this study, reports {{had appeared in the}} popular and trade literature describing the beneficial effects of Norwegian kelp meal on chick growth and feed utilization. To the knowl-edge of the authors these reports were based only on field observations and not on any controlled research. The study reported here represents observations made at this station {{over the past four years}} where Norwegian kelp meal was fed to male broiler crosses receiving <b>complete</b> corn-soybean-type <b>rations.</b> Using kelp meals prepared from a variety of other seaweed sources, previous investigators were unable to show that any nutritional benefits could be derived from supple-menting <b>complete</b> poultry <b>rations</b> (Miller and Bearse, 1936; Maclntyre and Jenkins, 1952; Black, 1955; and Middendorf el al. ...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that the classical Walrasian tatonnement process of adjusting prices {{does not need}} to converge. In several papers Weddepohl has shown cyclic or even chaotic behavior in discrete time tatonnement processes. Starting from a trivial non-trade disequilibrium with <b>complete</b> <b>rationing</b> on the supplies at a given vector of initial prices, a quantity and price adjustment process is proposed, converging always to a Walrasian equilibrium. At any price and rationing system generated by the process all markets clear, only supply rationing occurs, in the short run only rationing schemes are adjusted and in the long run both prices and rationings are adjusted. Furthermore, prices can only take values equal or above their initial values, while supply rationing only may occur when the corresponding price is on its initial value. ...|$|R
