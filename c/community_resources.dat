The social worker function can vary from providing superficial support to patients and families to intensive crisis-oriented counseling. Additionally, with a terminal illness often comes more complicated financial stressors; the social worker can be instrumental in connecting the patient and family with <b>community</b> <b>resources</b> including services such as Meals on Wheels. Lastly, if a patient is unable to be cared for at home, the social worker will work to find a safer place for the patient to receive hospice care.|$|E

40|$|Kofi Anani {{examines}} the <b>community</b> <b>resource</b> {{bases in the}} rural areas of Africa as the entry point for understanding the place-based consciousness of organizing livelihood activities in Africa. The goal is to present an argument for concerted efforts to utilize the <b>community</b> <b>resource</b> bases to promote sustainable governance of livelihoods in Africa as a place-based response to the globalization of the rural African world. He presents the place-based organizational principles of <b>community</b> <b>resource</b> bases in contradistinction to governance under globalism, which disrupts the participation processes of the <b>community</b> <b>resource</b> bases. He suggests the technological choices and investment commitments necessary to enhance the participation of the <b>community</b> <b>resource</b> bases in governance of livelihoods which would be a place-based response to globalism.

25|$|Artwork is {{generally}} {{viewed as a}} freely given gift made by the artist to the community {{at his or her}} own expense. Art grants are, however, available to participants via a system of curation and oversight, with application deadlines early in the year. Grants are intended to help artists produce work beyond the scope of their own means, and are generally intended to cover only a portion of the costs associated with creation of the pieces, usually requiring considerable reliance on an artist's <b>community</b> <b>resources.</b> Aggregate funding for all grants varies depending on the number and quality of the submissions (usually well over 100) but amounts to several percent (on the order of $500,000 in recent years) of the gross receipts from ticket sales. In 2006, 29 pieces were funded.|$|E
25|$|Peasants {{continued}} to center {{their lives in}} the village, where they were members of a corporate body, and to help manage the <b>community</b> <b>resources</b> and monitor the community life. In the East, they were serfs who were bound permanently to parcels of land. In most of Germany, farming was handled by tenant farmers who paid rents and obligatory services to the landlord, who was typically a nobleman. Peasant leaders supervised the fields and ditches and grazing rights, maintained public order and morals, and supported a village court which handled minor offenses. Inside the family the patriarch made all the decisions, and tried to arrange advantageous marriages for his children. Much of the villages' communal life centered around church services and holy days. In Prussia, the peasants drew lots to choose conscripts required by the army. The noblemen handled external relationships and politics for the villages under their control, and were not typically involved in daily activities or decisions.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{residents}} lived in circular or rectangular houses which they built between {{the river and the}} eastern secondary wall. The placement of the structures suggests that the layout was planned. The dwellings were built around a central ceremonial plaza likely used for rituals and public gatherings, as has been found at other similar locations. Posts for the house frames were placed either in individual holes, or in a trench dug slightly narrower than the posts. Walls were completed with wattle and daub, a plaster mixture of grass and clay, and the roof covered with bark or thatch. The doorway usually faced south to keep out the winter's north winds. Inside, a single family slept on pole-frame beds, covered with tamarack boughs, deer skins, and furs. Sometimes a fire was kept {{in the middle of the}} house and a hole in the roof let out the smoke. Pits dug in the earthen floor of the house held stored foods such as corn, nuts, and seeds in woven bags. Perishable foods like meat were probably stored outside prior to cooking. Pits outside were also used for garbage and <b>community</b> <b>resources.</b>|$|E
