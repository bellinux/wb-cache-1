50|$|A <b>coin</b> <b>tray</b> is a container, used {{to receive}} various small {{items such as}} coins, keys or {{transport}} tickets from trouser pockets. For example, when getting undressed before going to bed.|$|E
5000|$|Coin hopper is a {{container}} where the coins that are immediately available for payouts are held. The hopper is a mechanical device that rotates coins into the <b>coin</b> <b>tray</b> when a player collects credits/coins (by pressing a [...] "Cash Out" [...] button). When a certain preset coin capacity is reached, a coin diverter automatically redirects, or [...] "drops," [...] excess coins into a [...] "drop bucket" [...] or [...] "drop box." [...] (Unused coin hoppers {{can still be}} found even on games that exclusively employ Ticket-In Ticket-Out technology, as a vestige.) ...|$|E
50|$|Some <b>coin</b> <b>trays</b> are {{specialized}} {{for protecting}} and showing collections of coins.|$|R
50|$|There are <b>coin</b> <b>trays</b> in ceramic, leather, metal, textile or wood. The edges {{may be more}} or less flat.|$|R
5|$|The man taking <b>coins</b> {{from the}} <b>tray</b> is Andrzej Kościelecki, {{treasurer}} and Court Marshal who skillfully managed the state finances. Looking proudly, unworried, seeing only victory, he symbolizes {{the importance and}} wealth of Polish officials of the period.|$|R
50|$|He had a {{very quick}} wit which he used with his sleight of hand. He used both in a trick called the Boomerang Coins. He counts about twenty <b>coins</b> onto a <b>tray</b> and the <b>coins</b> are poured in the spectator’s hands. Five of the coins are given back to Tobias who vanishes them. The coins return to {{the hand of the}} spectator.|$|R
5000|$|Episode 39: Pairs faced {{their second}} major {{challenge}} for the week wherein one person in each pair needs to balance a <b>tray.</b> <b>Coins</b> will be added in the tray by the other person in the pair. The last pair standing wins the challenge and a monetary reward (see challenge section for more information). The challenge was won by Ralph & Christian. They also receive 50 thousand pesos for balancing 500 one peso coins. Afterwards, the pairs were visited by Francisco Colayco, an expert financial adviser, giving them tips in handling their finances.|$|R
40|$|Water vending {{machines}} provide an alternative source of clean and {{safe drinking water}} to the consumers. However, the quality of drinking water may alter due to contamination from lack of hygienic practices and maintenance of the machines. Hence, {{this study was conducted}} to determine the microbiological quality of water from {{vending machines}} and associated contact surfaces. Seventeen water samples and 85 swab samples (nozzles, drip <b>trays,</b> <b>coin</b> slots, buttons and doors) from 3 locations in Kelantan were collected. Polymerase chain reaction amplification and 16 S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequencing were carried out and sequences obtained were compared against the sequences available in the National Centre for Biotechnology Information database using the basic local alignment search tool programme. Coliform counts were observed in 94. 12 % of water samples, 76. 47 % of nozzles and 82. 35 % of drip tray swabs. Furthermore, results of 16 S rRNA sequence analysis indicated that two gram-negative isolates were identified as Escherichia coli U 5 / 41 (Accession no. NR_ 024570. 1) and E. coli O 157 :H 7 EDL 933 (Accession no. CP 008957. 1) with similarity value of 100 %, respectively. The results from this study further improve our understanding of the potential microorganisms in drinking water. Regular maintenance and cleaning of water vending machines are important to reduce bacterial growth and the presence of waterborne pathogens...|$|R
