40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} liberalizing tariffs and <b>textile</b> export <b>quotas</b> under Viet Nam’s accession to the WTO. To undertake the analysis, we develop a model of Viet Nam’s economy that reflects {{the importance of the}} duty exemption arrangements that allow export-oriented manufacturers to obtain intermediate inputs at world prices. The resulting GTAP-DD model is applied first to Viet Nam’s fourth multilateral tariff offer, and then to a hypothetical, deeper offer that takes Viet Nam’s average tariff below a simple average of 10 percent. The fourth offer is estimated to generate global gains of $ 460 million per year, of which over 60 percent accrues to Viet Nam. The deeper tariff experiment leads to annual gains of around $ 600 million per year, with $ 376 million accruing to Viet Nam. Under the fourth offer, most of the gains accrue from liberalization of the <b>textile</b> <b>quotas,</b> while the gains are roughly evenly split between tariff reform and <b>textile</b> <b>quota</b> abolition under the deeper reform scenario...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{government}} has {{realized that the}} {{textile and clothing sector}} is one sector that offers good prospects for diversification away from traditional commodity exports, for entry into the area of manufacturers, for absorption of large pools of manpower, for crossing the big divide between the rural and urban sectors, for poverty alleviation, and for gender empowerment. ” (Ministry of Finance, 2003, emphasis added) In 2005, the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) will give way to more liberalised global trade in textiles and clothing (T&C). The T&C industry is Pakistan’s major export engine. It also is a major employer of female workers. In the context of the social seclusion of women in Pakistan, the strong representation of women in the T&C industry makes the ATC implementation a gender equality issue. So far, the labour market implications of the change in the trade regime in general and its effects on gendered access to employment, in particular, have been neglected completely.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the effects of multi-fibre arrangement (MFA) quota elimination on Indian fibre market. The partial equilibrium Indian fibre model was developed using a theoretically consistent framework and incorporated regional supply response, substitutability between cotton and man-made fibres, and appropriate linkage between cotton and textile sectors. Baseline projections were developed for supply, demand and prices of cotton, man-made fibres and textiles under a set of exogenous assumptions. The effects of MFA <b>textile</b> <b>quota</b> eliminations were introduced into the model by conducting three scenarios, i. e. increasing textile exports by 10, 20 and 30 % from the baseline level. The results suggest that on an average, cotton imports rise by 4 - 8 % annually, while the man-made fibre exports from India decline {{with the opening of}} textile markets in the developed countries. The higher domestic cotton prices encourage acreage expansion in cotton in all the three regions in India, but not enough to meet rising mill demand under the scenarios of higher textile exports.

Among these Asian countries, Korea and China are important countries to compare in the textile and apparel industry. According to the WTO (World Trade Organization) International Trade Statistics, China, a developing country, has been ranked first in textile and apparel exports from 2010 to 2012. Despite rising labor costs, reminbi (RMB) appreciation, and lower demand from export markets, China’s textile industry is still growing at a healthy pace and looks to dominate the global apparel sector, both as a producer and as a consumer for years to come (Apparel Technology 2014). In comparison with other Asian textile and apparel players, even though Korea ranked eighth regarding textile and apparel exports in 2010 – 2012, as a developed country, it is also an important. In the past, Korea was a player in the international textile trade that saw its fortunes shift with the elimination of the EU <b>textile</b> <b>quotas</b> in 2005 period. That shift resulted in the plummeting of textile exports from $ 18.8 billion in 2000 to $ 11.6 billion in 2009.

It has also led to its diversion in trade, replacing exports to the U.S. with imports from China (Apparel Technology 2014).|$|R

Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the microbial community composition over two seasons (winter and summer) in activated sludge from well-operating textile wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in comparison with municipal WWTPs, and to explain observed differences by environmental variables. 454 -pyrosequencing generated 160 archaeal and 1645 bacterial species-level Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), with lower observed richness in activated sludge from textile WWTPs compared to municipal WWTPs. The bacterial phyla Planctomycetes, Chloroflexi, Chlorobi, and Acidobacteria were more abundant in activated sludge samples from textile WWTPs, together with archaeal members of Thaumarchaeota. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis of the microbial communities showed that microbial <b>communities</b> from <b>textile</b> and municipal WWTPs were significantly different, with a seasonal effect on archaea. Nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria as well as phosphate-accumulation bacteria were more abundant in municipal WWTPs, while sulfate-reducing bacteria were almost only detected in textile WWTPs. Additionally, microbial <b>communities</b> from <b>textile</b> WWTPs were more dissimilar than those of municipal WWTPs, possibly due to a wider diversity in environmental stresses to which microbial <b>communities</b> in <b>textile</b> WWTPs are subjected to. High salinity, high organic loads, and a higher water temperature were important potential variables driving the microbial <b>community</b> composition in <b>textile</b> WWTPs.
