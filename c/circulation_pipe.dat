Firstly, natural circulation experiment platform of flat plate domestic solar water heater was set up. The effect of two different positions of upper connecting pipe on temperature variation in the water tank during the heating stage in the daytime and thermal performances was measured. Through the analysis of test data, the difference of temperature stratification in the water tank with upper connecting pipe at high position and at low position were studied respectively. Also the instantaneous efficiency in 10 minutes was defined and compared. The results showed that there was better temperature stratification in the water tank when it's upper connecting pipe at high position during heating stage.

40|$|Noise {{radiation}} {{through the}} liquid-filled pipe {{system is the}} focus of noise control in the pipe systems of ships, while low-frequency line spectral disturbances with high energy need to be further suppressed. An Active Noise Control (ANC) system adapted to liquid-filled pipes is designed to attenuate low-frequency line spectral disturbances. This system is made up of the secondary source, controller, power amplifier, sensor etc. The system uses a frequency tracking algorithm to estimate the frequencies of noise, and a complex LMS algorithm to design the controller. A pump water <b>circulation</b> <b>pipe</b> system is implemented to validate the control system's performance in noise reduction through experiments. Active control experiments on noise sources with fixed frequency, sweeping frequency and multi-frequency are carried out respectively. The results show that the control system can track frequencies automatically, and effectively reduce the noise radiating from the pipe in cases of fixed frequency, sweeping frequency and multi-frequency. The ANC system can achieve noise attenuation of over 8 dB at multi-frequencies in liquid-filled pipes, and has good robustness. This provides a possible solution for the noise control of low-frequency line spectral disturbances in the pipe systems of ships...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{increasing}} demand on petroleum resources and depletion of easy accessible reservoirs result in exploration of challenging reservoirs. Drilling of deeper reservoirs {{is an important}} part of this challenge where increasing the well depth and harsh drilling circumstances arises torque and drag problems and &# 147;smart drilling fluids&# 148; are required to overcome such problems. These fluids can be obtained by using of some nano-materials to improve the tasks and features of drilling fluids. Use of the nanoparticles are promising and adding them into the drilling fluids can solve some problems during drilling such as lost <b>circulation,</b> <b>pipe</b> sticking, thermal instability, torque and drag and etc. In this work, improvement of lubrication behavior of drilling fluids are mainly investigated by adding nanoparticles into the oil-based mud (OBM). Tribological and rheological experiments were conducted to examine reduced friction and rheology of the mud by using titania and silica nanoparticles as an additive. Additionally, silica microparticles were also tested to compare with nanoparticles and to highlight the advantages of using drilling fluids with the nano-scale additive. Different particle concentrations were tested at the different temperatures to observe the effect of nanoparticle added fluids on rheological and tribological properties. The main purpose of this work is to determine right type of nanoparticles with optimum concentrations. In this thesis, rheological and tribological measurements were conducted on a modular compact rheometer (MCR). Afterwards, only tribological measurement was performed on standardized in-on-disk apparatus to validate the results acquired from MCR. The tribology experiments with the MCR and pin-on-disk (POD) apparatus were performed using rotational ball sliding on sample plates and disks, accordingly. While viscometer measurements with the MCR were done based on the function of the Fann viscometer. According to the experimental results, titania and silica added nanoparticles showed good reduced friction properties. Especially, silica nanoparticle added fluids with the concentration of 0. 25 weight% reduced friction coefficient by 47 % at the temperature of 50 &# 176;C. It is also found that silica nanoparticles are more effective in reducing the friction coefficient when it is compared to silica micro-particles. Additionally, coupling effect theory between temperature and nanoparticles was prove with addition of nanoparticles (NPs) to the OBM.

40|$|Emulsions {{are widely}} {{encountered}} in the food and cosmetic industry. The first food we consume is an emulsion, namely breast milk. Other common emulsions are mayonnaise, dressings, skin creams and lotions. Equipment often used {{for the production of}} oil-in-water emulsions in the food industry consists of a stirred vessel in combination with a colloid mill and a <b>circulation</b> <b>pipe.</b> Within this set-up there are two main variations: i) Configuration I where the colloid mill acts like a shearing device {{and at the same time}} as a pump. This configuration is used in the majority of the production facilities, and ii) Configuration II where the shearing and pumping action are not coupled. The operation procedure for obtaining a certain predefined emulsion quality is often established based on experience (best practice). This is most probably time-consuming (e. g. large experimental efforts for new developed products) and it is also unclear if the process is operated at its optimum (e. g. in minimum time). An other drawback is that there is no feedback during the production process. Hence, it is not possible to deal with disturbances acting on the process. A possible consequence is that, at the end of the production process, the product quality specifications are not met and the product has to be classified as off-spec. In order to be able to enlarge the efficiency of the production processes and to shorten the time to market of new products - and therewith create an advantage over competition - it is necessary to overcome these limitations of the current operation procedure. In the work reported a first step is set into this direction. A model describing the droplet size distribution (DSD) and the emulsion viscosity as function of the time was developed and several off-line optimization studies were performed. The model comprises several fit parameters and experiments were performed in order to estimate the values of these parameters. A number of additional experiments were performed to compare the simulated results with the measurements (model validation). The results of the parameter estimation and the model validation show that the simulated results are qualitatively in good agreement with the measurement data. Given the overall performance of the model it is expected that the model quality is sufficient to render practical relevant optimization results. Although the optimization studies have been performed for a model emulsion, small scale equipment and are not yet experimentally validated, the results of this work strongly suggest that it is indeed possible to minimize the production times and to shorten the product development times for new products. This overall conclusion is based on the following observations: 1) The optimization results show that it is beneficial to produce emulsions with Configuration II: - Configuration II allows the production of emulsions with a bi-modal DSD. No operation procedure was found for the production of such an emulsion in Configuration I. - The production of emulsions in Configuration II is always at least as fast as in Configuration I. 2) The followed approach allows to calculate: * If an emulsion with a certain, predefined, DSD and emulsion viscosity can be produced. * How the process should be controlled in order to produce such an emulsion. * How the process should be controlled to produce this emulsion in minimal time. 3) The optimization results show that it is possible to produce emulsions with: * A bi-modal DSD. * Less oil while maintaining a similar DSD and value of the emulsion viscosity evaluated at a shear rate of 10 1 /s by adapting only the operation procedure. Hence, the addition of extra stabilizers is not considered. This offers possibilities for the production of a broader range of emulsion products and could direct product development in a new direction. Based on this, it is worthwhile and therefore recommended to expand this research work in the direction of industrial emulsions. Design, Engineering and Productio...|$|E

30|$|Wellbore {{instability}} {{has been}} estimated to cause economic losses of about 8 billion US dollars per year (Cook et al. 2012).

In the Gulf of Mexico, lost <b>circulation,</b> stuck <b>pipe,</b> sloughing shales and wellbore collapse account for 44 % of the total non-productive time (Cook et al. 2012). The more non-productive time the well experiences will increase costs higher. Lost circulation does not only cause economic losses due to an increase in non-productive time. Uncontrolled loss of fluid can also damage the formation’s productivity and lead to further economic losses. The use of synthetic-based muds that range from $ 100 to $ 200 per barrel makes losing these fluids extremely costly.|$|R

The mean undisturbed ground temperature was estimated from data during the preliminary phase of a thermal response test (water <b>circulation</b> in the <b>pipe</b> loops), {{as well as from}} borehole logging measurements. The measurements during water circulation can significantly overestimate the ground temperature (up to 1. 7 C in this case study) for high ambient air temperature during the test, resulting in an overestimation of the maximum extracted power and of the heat pump coefficient of performance (COP). To limit the error in the COP and the extracted power to less than 5 %, the error in the undisturbed temperature estimation should not exceed ± 1. 5 °C and ± 0. 6 °C respectively.

The Design Manual Part I provides the thermal and hydraulic design analyses required {{for the design}} of a forced-cooled cable system of specified geometry. The thermal design establishes the relationship between the cable amperage, oil flow, and the conductorto- oil temperature difference and provides a coolant loop energy balance which includes an analysis of the pipe-to-soil heat transfer. Combination of both permits the maximization of the cable amperage while maintaining the cable temperature below the maximum allowable value. The hydraulic design establishes the pressure-flow characteristics for pipe-type cable systems and a systematic analysis is provided which allows for calculation of the pressure drop in the cable line and rturn line of the flow circuit as well as the circuit absolute pressure profile. The pressure drop governs the selection of <b>circulation</b> pumps, <b>pipe</b> strength characteristics, and strongly influences coolant loop length.

If it is not properly evaluated, it can lead to numerous drilling problems such as dangerous well kicks, lost <b>circulation,</b> blowouts, stuck <b>pipe,</b> excessive costs, and borehole instability. Pre-drill pore pressure estimation has been obtained from transform models using seismic interval velocities. However, the accuracy of this estimate of pore pressure {{is directly related to the}} reliability of these interval velocities. Bulk density was estimated from seismic interval velocity and transit time. Normal pore pressure gradient is estimated from the slope of a trendline that is generated from logarithm transit times versus depth. Overburden pressure at any depth was calculated from the integration of the average interval bulk densities and thicknesses above that depth. Pore pressure has been obtained from overburden pressure and observed interval velocities using modified Eaton’s equation. 154 CDPs were used along 28 seismic lines at Beni Suef basin, Western Desert, Egypt, to accomplish the purpose of this study. Two velocity reversal zones showing abnormally high pore pressure were detected and correlated to Abu Roash and Bahariya Formations. Moreover, pore pressure gradient maps were established for these two zones to predict the possible horizontal fluid flow (migration paths) for the proposal of prospects with lower pressures and less drilling risks. Finally, it is possible to calculate and recommend the required heavier mud weight to drill.|$|R

To address this, drilling industry is keen to establish accurate and reliable measurement of pressure in wellbore and to estimate the pore pressure and fracture pressure profile with utmost precision. In any drilling operation, {{it is important to}} maintain the annulus pressure within the geo- pressure margins (collapse and pore pressure on one side and fracturing pressure on the other side) For safe and effective drilling operation, it is therefore important to employ a method of estimating pore and fracture pressure before drilling and to update these estimate as the well is drilled and new information is required. In this thesis, we describe the way to predict pressure in between the sensor points. For this purpose, we use three different methods to estimate pressure in between the sensor points. We then describe {{how to deal with the}} uncertainties in between the sensor points by interpolation methods thereby estimating pressure points. Finally, we show how to integrate these methods to better quantify the uncertainties in real time data. However there are some external factors that influence the estimation of downhole pressure. These are the actual temperature gradient along the well, the proportion of cuttings in suspension, the presence of gas in the drilling fluid, the variations of borehole size due to cuttings beds or hole enlargements.

40|$|Solar {{water heating}} systems (SWHS) have fast become a {{suitable}} alternative to conventional water heating systems due to growing energy demands. A SWHS generally {{consists of a}} solar collector (which is used to convert solar radiation to heat), a water storage tank, and a flow control device such as a pump {{in the case of}} forced circulation SWHS. Extensive research and analysis on the operation and performance of these systems has been conducted, and results show that optimal flow control is an important factor {{that can be used to}} improve the performance and efficiency of SWHS. This study focuses on pump flow rate optimization for forced <b>circulation</b> SWHS with <b>pipes.</b> The system analyzed consists of an array of flat plate solar collectors, two storage tanks (one for the circulation fluid and one for the water), a heat exchanger, two pumps, and connecting pipes which are considered as one of the components of the SWHS so as to account for their thermal effects. The proposed model is developed using mainly the first and second laws of thermodynamics. The model is used to maximize the difference between the energy extracted from the solar collector and the combined sum of the energy extracted by the heat exchanger and corresponding energies used by the pumps in the primary and secondary loops. The objective function maximizes the overall system energy gain whilst minimizing the sum of the energy extracted by the heat exchanger and energy used by the corresponding pumps in the secondary loop to conserve the stored energy and meet the user requirement of water tank temperatures. The model is solved using the fmincon solver in MATLAB’s optimization toolbox. When compared to other flow control techniques, in particular the most suitable energy efficient control strategy, the results of this study show a significant increase in the system’s overall energy gain. The results also illustrate the effects of system pipe thermal losses for the different control strategies, hence highlighting the importance of developing a model that takes such losses into account so as to improve the overall accuracy of the model.

40|$|Detailed {{experimental}} {{measurements of}} a self sustained micro-channel electronics equipment cooler were performed,using methanol and purified water as working fluid and 4 samples of cooler was fabricated and a scheme of optimize was presented. A high speed {{data acquisition system}} was used to acquire the cooling performance of the samples, and we got the diagram and data of oscillations which is helpful for optimization. In this experiment, {{the effect of the}} different working fluid on the thermal performance of cooler, effect of fill ratio and effect of heating power were analyzed. Meanwhile, the mechanism of the oscillation was analyzed. It is found that the cooler with methanol has smaller oscillation period and is easy to be boiled over and which with water has irregular diagram of oscillation. Owing to the higher enthalpy of vaporization and surface tension cooler with water can perform better at low fill ratio than with methanol. It works better at low heating power, such as 130 W, with water as working fluid. Owing to the higher liquidity, it works better at high heating power with methanol. The best fill ratio is in 30 %～ 50 %, according to the definition of this paper. Cooler with low ratio is likely to be boiled over, and high ratio is harmful to circulation. The structure of pipes influences the performance of heat dissipating. The cooler with improved structure according to the data acquired by experiments is more capable to dissipate heat. The number of pipe elbow should be as few as possible in order to. promote circulation, besides that the structure of condenser should has little fluid deposit and the length of fall between condenser and evaporator should be large at high heating power and reverse at low power. There are four modes of circulation, called common circulation, reverse circulation,single heat pipe and double heat <b>pipe</b> respectively. Common <b>circulation</b> is that working fluid runs along the preset sequence that from evaporator, to evaporator pipe, to condenser and comes back to evaporator. Working fluid runs towards the opposite direction to common circulation in reverse <b>circulation.</b> Single heat <b>pipe</b> menas that the vapor runs along the evaporator pipe, then turns to liquid and comes back to evaporator along the same way, and the working fluid doesn’t run along the condenser pipe. Double heat pipe means that the working fluid runs along both the evaporator pipe and condenser pipe to condenser and comes back through the same way. Different running mode indicates different working performance. Fabricate a cooler which is appropriate to CPU of personal computer, and it runs well for long-term use. 本文以水、甲醇作为工质，设计并制成了 4 个冷却器样品，对其冷却性能进行了实验研究，并提出了冷却器的设计优化方案。采用高速动态数据采集系统对冷却器的散热性能进行了测试，获得了脉动及冷却性能曲线等数据，为冷却器的优化设计奠定了基础。在实验中，研究了不同的工质对冷却器散热性能的影响、冷却器的最佳充液率、加热功率对散热性能的影响、冷却器的不同结构对散热性能的影响，并且分析了实验中出现的一些特殊的脉动现象，解释了其原因。 由于甲醇具有较好的流动性和较小的表面张力和汽化潜热，因而具有较短的脉动周期，容易在较高功率的时候发生烧干。而以水为工质制成的冷却器，脉动曲线极不规则。但是由于水具有较高的汽化潜热和表面张力，可在较少的工质充液率下获得更好的散热效果。根据实验可知，在较低功率例如 130 W以下时，以水作为工质效果更好。在较高功率时，由于甲醇的流动性更好，采用甲醇作为工质效果更好。 根据本文定义的充液率，冷却器的最佳充液率在 30 %～ 50 ％，过低容易发生烧干，过高则影响工质的循环传热。 冷却器的管路结构对于散热性能具有重大影响。根据实验数据改进获得的冷却器结构具有更好的散热能力。尽量减少管道弯头数量以免影响工质循环流动，采取降低冷凝器存液的结构，在较高功率时使用较大的蒸发器与冷凝器高度差，较小功率时使用较小的高度差。 发现了冷却器的不同运行模式，有正运行、逆运行、单热管和双热管四种模式。正运行指的是工质沿着预定的顺序从蒸发器汽化，沿着蒸汽管进入冷凝器，然后冷凝回流到蒸发器。逆运行则是工质运行方向相反。单热管指的是功率很低时，蒸汽从蒸汽管运行到冷凝器，然后原路返回，不经过冷凝管。双热管则是蒸汽同时从蒸汽管和冷凝管上升到达冷凝器，然后沿原管路返回蒸发器。不同的运行模式揭示了冷却器在不同情况下的工作性能。 最后在个人电脑CPU上设计安装了此冷却器，长期运行证明本冷却器效果良好...|$|R
40|$|The EPSPEX {{system is}} a {{distribution}} system for district heat with media pipes of cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) insulated by blocks of expanded polystyrene (EPS). In this low-pressure distribution system two pipes are used for a space heating circuit, having layers of EVAL to hinder oxygen diffusion, whereas two pipes without diffusion barrier are used for delivery of hot tap water and warm water <b>circulation.</b> The four <b>pipes</b> are placed in the insulating blocks of EPS. Environmental impacts from production, laying and use of an EPSPEX district heat distribution system have been investigated using life cycle methodology. The distribution {{system is a}} secondary system developed specially for areas with low heat density. The case studied is the installation and use of an EPSPEX system in Vråen, Värnamo, Sweden. The environmental impacts are described in four categories: climate change, acidification, eutrophication and use of finite resources. Four weighting methods have also {{been used in the}} evaluation: EPS 2000, Ecoscarcity, ExternE and EcoIndicator 99. While carefully considering the precise circumstances of this study, the findings can be adapted for using the EPSPEX district heat distribution systems in other areas. During this study the question was raised of how this district heat delivery system compares with systems that use conventional district heating pipes. This has been further investigated and is reported {{in the second part of}} this report: Miljöbelastning från EPSPEX-systemet. Del 2 : Konventionella twinrör eller EPSPEX  vad är bäst ur miljösynpunkt. In the second part the environmental impacts from the EPSPEX system have been compared with the impacts from conventional twin pipes (polyurethane insulated steel media pipes) used in a comparable setting. A discussion on the environmental choice between media pipes of PEX and steel can also be found in the second part. It should be noted that the two systems for district heat distribution are not fully comparable in function. The EPSPEX system has stricter limitations regarding pressure and temperature compared with the conventional system. The EPSPEX system is also limited in use for well drained ground conditions above the water table. Conventional district heating pipes do not have this limitation. The most important possibility to decrease the environmental impacts from the EPSPEX system is to increase the insulation, this even though the distribution system is comparably well insulated to start with. The environmental life cycle impacts of the distribution pipe system  production, laying and use  are predominated by the extra heat that has to be generated to cover the heat losses from the system. When this report was written, measurements from systems in use to confirm the model calculation of heat losses are still lacking. More fine-tuned results can be achieved when studies of the EPSPEX system in use have been concluded. Among different components in the EPSPEX system the impacts from production and transport of EPS-blocks make the major impact. Thus, it is important to utilize the polystyrene material as efficiently as possible, minimizing spillage, and to ensure that unavoidable spillage is recycled as material. However, the environmental impacts from production of the insulating blocks are well outweighed by the decreased environmental impacts gained by using the insulation. In product development it is thus important to ensure that the insulating capacity of the EPSPEX system is never decreased. Machines used for excavating the pipe trenches combust diesel oil, and the production and use of this diesel oil generates a substantial part of the environmental impacts by several of the assessment methods used. If possible, it is desirable to further minimize the excavation work and to use mini excavators and low emitting machines (especially regarding nitrous oxides). The brass swaged coupling used to connect the PEX-pipes, gives a strong impact regarding acidification and the two weighting methods EPS 2000 and Ecoscarcity, especially when compared to the very small volume fraction these devices constitute. It would be advisable to study if the devices could be made from other material or from recycled material...|$|R
