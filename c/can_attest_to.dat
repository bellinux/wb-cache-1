In an interview with Sports Illustrated reporter William Nack, Biyiasas assessed Fischer's play:He was too good. There was no use in playing him. It wasn't interesting. I was getting beaten, and it wasn't clear to me why. It wasn't like I made this mistake or that mistake. It was like I was being gradually outplayed, from the start. He wasn't taking any time to think. The most depressing thing about it is that I wasn't even getting out of the middle game to an endgame. I don't ever remember an endgame. He honestly believes there is no one for him to play, no one worthy of him. I played him, and I <b>can</b> <b>attest</b> <b>to</b> that.|$|E

Gilchrist provided an outlook on each character, describing Grey as a [...] "prodigiously talented but insecure surgeon, waylaid by her love for attending Derek Shepherd", while stating that Yang, [...] "an aggressively ambitious intern" [...] lacks knowledge on any topic, except medicine, comparing her to boyfriend Burke, described as her opposite. In response to George O'Malley's story line, he noted how his sensitive personality constantly results in difficulty in his path to becoming a proper surgeon.

40|$|International audiencePurpose - Many {{companies}} <b>can</b> today <b>attest</b> <b>to</b> having obtained {{significant progress}} in their performance using some improvement processes (six sigma, 5 S, business process reengineering, etc.). But they <b>can</b> also <b>attest</b> <b>to</b> experiencing difficulties in sustaining {{the use of these}} processes over time. The aim {{of this paper is to}} describe all the specific actions which can contribute to the sustaining of these processes. Design/methodology/approach - An empirical research methodology is used by carrying out a survey of 40 Swiss and French manufacturing companies regarding their approach to the sustaining of some of their improvement processes. Findings - A model of sustainability for an improvement process is proposed. This model is founded on three axes: organic state, return on effort and facilitation. To sustain an improvement process over time consists in taking these three axes into account by managing their relative importance in space and over time. The paper details the generic actions associated with each of the three axes. These actions are then illustrated using the context of a sustained statistical process control project. Originality/value - The survey detailed in this paper confirms the difficulty of companies have in sustaining their improvement processes over time, since the average sustainability ratio for all the different processes mentioned rarely exceeds 40 per cent. The paper gives all the specific actions which can contribute to sustain these processes better...|$|R
