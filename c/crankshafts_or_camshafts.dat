40|$|AbstractDue to the {{increasing}} demand on many transmissions parts, such as synchronizing gears, <b>crankshafts</b> <b>or</b> <b>camshafts,</b> surface integrity along with appropriate fatigue performance is becoming a key issue in automotive industry. This paper proposes an experimental study covering the influence of three superfinishing processes on surface integrity of a SAE 5120 steel: belt-finishing, ball burnishing and mass-finishing. Surface and sub- surface properties, i. e. residual stresses, near surface microstructure, surface roughness and bearing parameters, have been analyzed to highlight the influence of different process parameters, to compare each process to another and assess the benefits compared to conventional turning...|$|E
40|$|Free-piston {{diesel engines}} are {{characterized}} by freely moving pistons without any <b>crankshaft</b> <b>or</b> <b>camshaft</b> connected to the pistons. This allows a compact and efficient engine design, but requires automatic control of the piston motion. This paper present a dynamic mathematical model of a free-piston diesel engine, and a control oriented dynamic analysis leading to a piston motion control structure. Experimental results using a full scale test cylinder are included and show feasibility of the suggested control approach...|$|R
5000|$|In older vehicles, the {{tachometer}} {{is driven}} by the RMS voltage waves from the low tension (LT) side of the ignition coil, while on others (and nearly all diesel engines, which have no ignition system) engine speed is determined by the frequency from the alternator tachometer output. This is from a special connection called an [...] "AC tap" [...] which is a connection to one of the stator's coil output, before the rectifier. Tachometers driven by a rotating cable from a drive unit fitted to the engine (usually on the camshaft) exist - usually on simple diesel-engined machinery with basic or no electrical systems. On recent EMS found on modern vehicles, the signal for the tachometer is usually generated from an ECU which derives the information from either the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>or</b> <b>camshaft</b> speed sensor.|$|R
40|$|The figure {{presents}} a cross-sectional {{view of a}} supercharged, variable-compression, two-cycle, internal-combustion engine that offers significant advantages over prior such engines. The improvements are embodied in a combination of design changes that contribute synergistically to improvements in performance and economy. Although the combination of design changes and the principles underlying them are complex, {{one of the main}} effects of the changes on the overall engine design is reduced (relative to prior two-cycle designs) mechanical complexity, which translates directly to reduced manufacturing cost and increased reliability. Other benefits include increases in the efficiency of both scavenging and supercharging. The improvements retain the simplicity and other advantages of two-cycle engines while affording increases in volumetric efficiency and performance across a wide range of operating conditions that, heretofore have been accessible to four-cycle engines but not to conventionally scavenged two-cycle ones, thereby increasing the range of usefulness of the two-cycle engine into all areas now dominated by the four-cycle engine. The design changes and benefits are too numerous to describe here in detail, but it is possible to summarize the major improvements: Reciprocating Shuttle Inlet Valve The entire reciprocating shuttle inlet valve and its operating gear is constructed as a single member. The shuttle valve is actuated in a lost-motion arrangement in which, at the ends of its stroke, projections on the shuttle valve come to rest against abutments at the ends of grooves in a piston skirt. This shuttle-valve design obviates the customary complex valve mechanism, actuated from an engine <b>crankshaft</b> <b>or</b> <b>camshaft,</b> yet it is effective with every type of two-cycle engine, from small high-speed single cylinder model engines, to large low-speed multiple cylinder engines...|$|R
25|$|Wankel engines {{generally}} {{are able to}} reach much higher engine revolutions than reciprocating engines of similar power output. This {{is due to the}} smoothness inherent in circular motion, and the absence of highly stressed parts such as <b>crankshafts,</b> <b>camshafts</b> <b>or</b> connecting rods. Eccentric shafts do not have the stress related contours of crankshafts. The maximum revolutions of a rotary engine is limited by tooth load on the synchronizing gears. Hardened steel gears are used for extended operation above 7000 or 8000rpm. Mazda Wankel engines in auto racing are operated above 10,000rpm. In aircraft they are used conservatively, up to 6500 or 7500rpm. However, as gas pressure participates in seal efficiency, racing a Wankel engine at high rpm under no load conditions can destroy the engine.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>camshaft</b> (<b>or</b> <b>camshafts,</b> {{depending}} on the design employed) is located above the valves within the cylinder head, and operates either indirectly or directly on the valves.|$|R
50|$|In a piston engine, a {{piston rod}} joins a piston to the {{crosshead}} {{and thus to}} the connecting rod that drives the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>or</b> (for steam locomotives) the driving wheels.|$|R
50|$|SCHAUDT {{supplies}} {{solutions for}} cylindrical grinding, noncircular grinding and universal grinding between centers. Common applications are grinding <b>camshafts,</b> <b>crankshafts</b> <b>or</b> gear shafts in {{the automotive industry}} and for the mechanical engineering and roll manufacturing industry.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{frictional}} {{and mechanical}} {{losses in the}} various drivetrain components, the measured rear wheel brake horsepower is generally 15-20 percent less than the brake horsepower measured at the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>or</b> flywheel on an engine dynamometer.|$|R
50|$|Changing the {{original}} crankshaft pulley {{can also have}} negative effects if the replacement pulley is not manufactured properly. A <b>crankshaft</b> <b>or</b> accessory pulley not machined or balanced properly can cause severe damage leading to {{thousands of dollars in}} repairs.|$|R
50|$|An engine {{dynamometer}} measures {{power and}} torque directly from the engine's <b>crankshaft</b> (<b>or</b> flywheel), when the engine {{is removed from the}} vehicle. These dynos do not account for power losses in the drivetrain, such as the gearbox, transmission, and differential.|$|R
5000|$|This {{system uses}} a belt <b>or</b> <b>camshaft</b> driven pump {{from the engine}} to pressurise a special {{hydraulic}} fluid, which then powers the brakes, suspension and power steering. [...] It can also power any number of features such as the clutch, turning headlamps and even power windows.|$|R
50|$|If {{torsional}} vibration is not controlled in a crankshaft {{it can cause}} failure of the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>or</b> any accessories that are being driven by the crankshaft (typically {{at the front of}} the engine; the inertia of the flywheel normally reduces the motion at the rear of the engine).|$|R
5000|$|In automobiles, a {{mechanical}} fan provides engine cooling and prevents the engine from overheating by blowing or drawing air through a coolant-filled radiator. The fan may be driven with a {{belt and pulley}} off the engine's <b>crankshaft</b> <b>or</b> an electric motor switched on or off by a thermostatic switch.|$|R
5000|$|The maximum {{acceleration}} for the MP 55 was restrained at [...] for passenger comfort. The traction equipment used was either electro-pneumatic (EMC) <b>or</b> <b>camshaft</b> electric (Jeumon-Heidmann, <b>or</b> JH) and {{the braking system}} used was also of electro-pneumatic type, though a gradual variant was used. In 1967, automatic drive (ATO) was implemented on all trainsets.|$|R
50|$|As well as {{damaging}} the propeller itself, a prop strike {{with the engine}} running can cause severe damage to the engine and its connected accessories, such as the alternator. An engine tear down and rebuild is usually recommended, otherwise {{there is a risk}} of an in-flight engine failure, broken <b>crankshaft</b> <b>or</b> loss of propeller.|$|R
50|$|An {{underdrive}} pulley {{refers to}} a <b>crankshaft</b> <b>or</b> accessory pulley (a/c, alternator, power steering, water pump, etc.) designed to turn at a slower speed than stock. To Underdrive means to slow the rate of rotation in a system. Underdrive is achieved by either making the crank/main (drive) pulley smaller or the accessory (driven) pulley larger than the original diameter pulleys.|$|R
50|$|Wells {{lights were}} also used in the {{erection}} and repair of large stationary steam engines. Typically this was for the shrink-fitting of components such as large crankpins in <b>crankshafts</b> <b>or</b> flywheels. The <b>crankshaft</b> web would be heated to expand it until the pin could be slid or gently hammered into place. On cooling, the pin would be securely held in place.|$|R
5000|$|Car testers {{are most}} {{familiar}} with the chassis dynamometer or [...] "rolling road" [...] installed in many workshops. This measures drive wheel brake horsepower, which is generally 15-20% less than the brake horsepower measured at the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>or</b> flywheel on an engine dynamometer. A YouTube video shows workshop measurement of a car's power. The measured power curve in kW is shown at 3:39.|$|R
50|$|Inline twins with a 360° {{crankpin}} offset or flat-twins can {{be easily}} converted into twingles by firing both of the cylinders {{at the same time}} and installing a <b>camshaft</b> <b>or</b> <b>camshafts</b> that operate both cylinders' valves in parallel. Because many such engines already employ the wasted spark principle, only the camshaft modification is necessary. The Vintage Dirt Track Racing Association (VDTRA) 2010 Rules have banned vintage motorcycles from being set up as a twingle.|$|R
50|$|With the {{direct-drive}} method, {{the propeller}} is attached {{directly on the}} engine's spinning <b>crankshaft</b> (<b>or</b> motor shaft). This arrangement is optimum when the propellor and powerplant share overlapping regions of best efficiency (measured in RPM.) Direct-drive {{is by far the}} most common when using a fuel-powered engine (gas or glow). Some electric motors with high torque and (comparatively) low speed can utilize direct-drive as well. These motors are typically outrunners.|$|R
50|$|Less complex drive system: OHV engines have a {{less complex}} drive {{system for the}} {{camshaft}} when compared with OHC engines. Most OHC engines drive the <b>camshaft</b> <b>or</b> <b>camshafts</b> using a timing belt, a chain, or multiple chains. These systems {{require the use of}} tensioners which add complexity. In contrast, an OHV engine has the camshaft positioned close to the crankshaft which may be driven by a much shorter chain or even direct gear connection. However, this is somewhat negated by a more complex valvetrain requiring pushrods.|$|R
50|$|Straight engines with an {{odd number}} of {{cylinders}} are inherently unbalanced because there are always an odd number of pistons moving in one direction while a different number move the opposite direction. This causes an end-to-end rocking motion at crankshaft speed in a straight-three engine. V6 designs will behave like two unbalanced three-cylinder engines running on the same crankshaft unless steps are taken to mitigate it, for instance by using offset journals or flying arms on the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>or</b> a counter-rotating balance shaft.|$|R
50|$|In most types, {{the linear}} {{movement}} of the piston is converted to a rotating movement via a connecting rod and a <b>crankshaft</b> <b>or</b> by a swashplate or other suitable mechanism. A flywheel {{is often used to}} ensure smooth rotation or to store energy to carry the engine through an un-powered part of the cycle. The more cylinders a reciprocating engine has, generally, the more vibration-free (smoothly) it can operate. The power of a reciprocating engine is proportional to the volume of the combined pistons' displacement.|$|R

50|$|As stated above, the {{cylinders}} in a diesel engine are fed by a unit injector, {{which in turn}} is fed by a <b>crankshaft</b> <b>or</b> charger driven injection pump. Maximum pump RPM (and thus the pressure of fuel supplied to the injectors) is regulated by a centrifugal governor. The operator regulates the nozzle clearance of the injector and the governor thus adjusts the fuel pressure to keep stable RPM. Failure of any part of the mechanism, particularly the governor can cause an uncontrolled amount of fuel to enter the nozzles creating a positive feedback loop.|$|R
50|$|A much-improved system {{placed the}} shims above the tappet. This allowed each shim {{to be changed}} without {{removing}} either the tappet <b>or</b> <b>camshaft,</b> usually by pressing the tappet and valve down against the valve spring with a lever tool and removing the shim with tweezers. A difficulty with this system is that the rubbing surface of the tappet becomes {{the surface of the}} shim, which is a difficult problem of mass-production metallurgy. The first mass production engine to use this system was the Fiat twin-cam engine of the early 1960s, followed by engines from Volvo and the water-cooled Volkswagens.|$|R
25|$|In an Engine Management System (EMS), {{electronics}} control {{fuel delivery}} and ignition timing. Primary sensors {{on the system}} are <b>crankshaft</b> angle (<b>crankshaft</b> <b>or</b> Top Dead Center (TDC) position), airflow into the engine and throttle position. The circuitry determines which cylinder needs fuel and how much, opens the requisite injector to deliver it, then causes a spark {{at the right moment}} to burn it. Early EMS systems used an analogue computer to accomplish this, but as embedded systems dropped in price and became fast enough {{to keep up with the}} changing inputs at high revolutions, digital systems started to appear.|$|R
50|$|A {{rectangular}} cross-section aluminium casting holds the five main bearings and the bearings {{for the two}} camshafts. This makes the sump below the crankcase independent and its removal does not disturb the engine's <b>crankshaft</b> <b>or</b> its bearings. Either camshaft can be removed sideways at any time through large doors which also give access to the small rock-levers through which the cams operate the pushrods. Another set of detachable doors on each side gives access to each big end bearing. The aluminium casting forming the crankcase rests on two cast-steel cradles which firmly hold the engine in the chassis.|$|R
50|$|A tunnel crankcase, tunnel <b>{{crankshaft}}</b> <b>or</b> disc-webbed <b>crankshaft</b> {{engine is}} a diesel engine where the crankshaft is {{designed so that}} the main bearings (the bearings that support the crankshaft within the crankcase) are enlarged in diameter, such {{that they are now}} larger than the crank webs (the radial arms that link the big end bearings to the main bearings). They thus form the largest diameter of any part of the crankshaft. Rather than a conventional crankcase that has webs across it to support the narrow bearings of a conventional crankcase, the crankcase now has a large tunnel through it, hence the name.|$|R

5000|$|Induction {{hardening}} is {{a surface}} hardening technique which uses induction coils {{to provide a}} very rapid means of heating the metal. With induction heating, the steel can be heated very quickly to red-hot at the surface, before the heat can penetrate any distance into the metal. The surface is then quenched, hardening it, and is often used without further tempering. This makes the surface very resistant to wear, but provides tougher metal directly underneath it, leaving {{the majority of the}} object unchanged. A common use for induction hardening is for hardening the bearing surfaces, or [...] "journals", on automotive <b>crankshafts</b> <b>or</b> the rods of hydraulic cylinders.|$|R
5000|$|Data {{representing}} {{the amount of}} power output desired by the driver (sometimes known as [...] "engine load") is also used by the engine control unit in calculating the amount of fuel required. A throttle position sensor (TPS) provides this information. Other engine sensors used in EFI systems include a coolant temperature sensor, a <b>camshaft</b> <b>or</b> <b>crankshaft</b> position sensor (some systems get the position information from the distributor), and an oxygen sensor which is installed in the exhaust system {{so that it can}} be used to determine how well the fuel has been combusted, therefore allowing closed loop operation.|$|R
50|$|The {{combustion}} process increases the internal {{energy of a}} gas, which translates into an increase in temperature, pressure, or volume depending on the configuration. In an enclosure, for example the cylinder of a reciprocating engine, the volume is controlled and the combustion creates an increase in pressure. In a continuous flow system, for example a jet engine combustor, the pressure is controlled and the combustion creates an increase in volume.This increase in pressure or volume {{can be used to}} do work, for example, to move a piston on a <b>crankshaft</b> <b>or</b> a turbine disc in a gas turbine. If the gas velocity changes, thrust is produced, such as in the nozzle of a rocket engine.|$|R
50|$|The final {{developments}} of the aircraft piston engine were the horizontally-opposed H-engines such as the Rolls-Royce Eagle and the Napier Sabre. These compact engines were tightly packed and, unlike the previous V engines, there was no access to the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>or</b> its bearings once {{the two halves of}} the crankcase were assembled. Accordingly long through-studs were used, passing right through the engine {{from one side to the}} other. On the Sabre, some of these studs were short and served only to clamp the crankcase halves together. The others passed between cylinder heads on each side. The entire tensile force across the engine was taken on these studs, with no tension being placed on the crankcase.|$|R
