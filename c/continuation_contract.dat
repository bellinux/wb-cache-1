40|$|In {{this paper}} I study {{a class of}} {{repeated}} two-sided moral hazard problems with discounting. I consider two agents {{who are involved in}} multiperiod, and possibly infinite-horizon, contractual relationships. In every period, the agents simultaneously take hidden actions, each of which independently affects the distribution of a separate random public signal. The realizations of the public signals jointly determine the output of a perishable final good, which the agents consume. This abstract framework can be used to analyze contractual relations within a variety of institutions, such as partnership firms, households, or cooperatives, in which bilateral moral hazard is an essential feature. I examine the nature of Pareto optimal contracts in this environment that respect both technological and informational constraints. After establishing the existence of optimal contracts, I show that every <b>continuation</b> <b>contract</b> of an optimal contract is itself optimal. Using this recursive property, next I derive a partial, but fairly general, characterization of optimal consumption allocations. It is an equation that links the ratio of marginal utilities of the agents in the current period to the same ratio in the next period. Moreover, optimal contracts imply that the sequence of ratios of marginal utilities in each period is a submartingale. I provide sufficient conditions for the submartingale to converge. Finally, using this result, I identify conditions under which one agent receives all surplus in the long run. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} role of the {{financial}} system in the amplification and propagation of business cycles. Chapter 1 studies the origin and propagation of balance sheet recessions. I first show that in standard models driven by TFP shocks, the balance sheet channel disappears when agents are allowed to write contracts on the aggregate state of the economy. In contrast, I show how uncertainty shocks can drive balance sheet recessions with depressed asset prices and growth, and trigger a "flight to quality" event with low interest rates and high risk-premia. Uncertainty shocks create an endogenous hedging motive that induces financial intermediaries to take on a disproportionate fraction of aggregate risk, even when contracts can be written on the aggregate state of the economy. Finally, I explore some implications for financial regulation. Chapter 2 studies a tractable model of dynamic moral hazard with purely pecuniary private benefits. The agent can trade a productive asset and secretly divert funds to a private account and use them to "recontract": at any time he can offer a new <b>continuation</b> <b>contract</b> to the principal, who accepts if the new contract is attractive. The main result is that the optimal contract can be characterized as the solution to a standard portfolio problem with a simple "skin in the game" constraint. The setting places few restrictions on preferences and the distribution of shocks, distinguishes between (observable) aggregate shocks and (unobservable) idiosyncratic shocks, and takes arbitrary general equilibrium prices as given. This makes the results easily applicable to many macro and financial applications. Chapter 3 explores under what conditions the presence of moral hazard can create a balance sheet amplification channel. If the private action of the agent exposes him to aggregate risk through his unobserved private benefit, the optimal contract will try to over-expose him to aggregate risk to deter him from misbehaving. This creates a tradeoff between aggregate and idiosyncratic risk-sharing. More productive agents naturally want to leverage more and therefore have larger incentives to distort their aggregate risk-sharing in order to reduce their exposure to idiosyncratic risk. In equilibrium, therefore, more productive agents take on a disproportionate fraction of aggregate risk, creating a balance sheet channel. by Sebastian T. Di Tella. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|There {{is now an}} {{extensive}} literature regarding the efficient design of incentive mechanisms in dynamic environments. In this literature, there are no exogenous links across time periods because either privately observed shocks are assumed time independent or past private actions have no influence on the realizations of current variables. The absence of exogenous links across time periods ensures that preferences over <b>continuation</b> <b>contracts</b> are common knowledge, making the definition of incentive compatible contracts {{at a point in}} time a simple matter. In this paper, we present general recursive methods to handle environments where privately observed variables are linked over time.

40|$|We {{develop a}} model of {{strategic}} contractual incompleteness that identifies conditions under which principals might omit even costlessly verifiable terms. We then use experiments to test comparative statics predictions of the model. While {{it is well known}} that verifiability imperfections can limit complete contracting, researchers know less about how the degree of imperfection affects endogenous incompleteness, particularly with repeat trading. In our baseline treatment with perfect verifiability, subjects overwhelmingly used complete contracts to conduct trades, achieving nearly first best outcomes. In our partial verifiability treatment with a reduced set of verifiable performance levels, the results reversed and parties relied heavily on incomplete contracts that omitted even costlessly verifiable terms. However, the efficacy of incomplete contracts in outperforming available complete contracts depends critically on the continuation probability of repeat trading. With a small <b>continuation</b> probability, incomplete <b>contracts</b> did no better than complete contracts while exposing parties to considerable strategic uncertainty...|$|R

40|$|We present Pycket, a {{high-performance}} tracing JIT compiler for Racket. Pycket supports {{a wide variety}} of the sophisticated fea-tures in Racket such as <b>contracts,</b> <b>continuations,</b> classes, structures, dynamic binding, and more. On average, over a standard suite of benchmarks, Pycket outperforms existing compilers, both Racket’s JIT and other highly-optimizing Scheme compilers. Further, Pycket provides much better performance for proxies than existing systems, dramatically reducing the overhead of contracts and gradual typ-ing. We validate this claim with performance evaluation on multiple existing benchmark suites. The Pycket implementation is of independent interest as an ap-plication of the RPython meta-tracing framework (originally cre-ated for PyPy), which automatically generates tracing JIT compilers from interpreters. Prior work on meta-tracing focuses on bytecode interpreters, whereas Pycket is a high-level interpreter based on the CEK abstract machine and operates directly on abstract syntax trees. Pycket supports proper tail calls and first-class continuations. In the setting of a functional language, where recursion and higher-order functions are more prevalent than explicit loops, the most significant performance challenge for a tracing JIT is identifying which control flows constitute a loop—we discuss two strategies for identifying loops and measure their impact. 1...|$|R

At that time kuni {{had an obligation}} to pay to shōen owner the benefits the amount of which was determined as to his dignity by the central government. Bempo system is a means usually used when kuni could not prepare the benefits since the taxation from peasants cultivating public fields did not function well; kuni transferred shōen owner its right of taxation from fields the dimensions of which was corresponding to the amount of the benefits. This field was usually selected, according to shōen owner's request, from fields which shōen owner had received from peasants as kishinchi, and this means practical {{exemption from}} tax. This system was not admitted by the central government and a contract of bempo became invalid when the term of tenure of the kokushi who contracted was over. However, in most case the new kokushi could not refuse shōen owner's request of <b>continuation</b> of a <b>contract</b> because they felt sorry for accumulated debt of the delinquent benefits, which had not paid while bempo was performed as substitution of payment.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of probationer servicemen correction is estimated {{in the context}} of the task of saving military personnel. The fact of probation is proved not to be the absolute ground for dismissing a serviceman. Serving in the Russian Armed Forces of probationer commanders, who must require from their non-convicted subordinates to observe the Constitution and the laws, is considered inadmissible. The estimation of {{efficiency of}} probationer servicemen correction is exercised according to such criteria as: the number of probation reversals with the following real service of sentence; addition or reversal of probationer servicemen’ obligations; reversal of probation due to probationer’s good behavior and discharge of obligations; <b>continuation</b> of probationer <b>contract</b> employees’ service. It is proposed to introduce new criterion for estimating correction of probationer servicemen – presence (absence) of authority punishments stipulated by service regulations of the Russian Armed Forces. The absence of punishments or the presence of encouragements can indicate that a serviceman has discharged the obligations imposed by court fairly and executed orders of military unit’s command. The author proves the reasonability of establishing additional obligations charged by servicemen’s approval (which cannot be executed toward civilians) to rise the efficiency of probationer servicemen correction. They are: participation in operations on destroying gangster squads; release of hostages; conducting rescue activities; taking epidemiological, anti-gas and radiative measures directly in the centre of destruction...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three essays on the estimation of the risk parameter LGD. The first essay (Hartmann-Wendels, Miller, and Töws, 2014, Loss given default for leasing: Parametric and nonparametric estimations) fills a gap in LGD related literature by focusing on elementary differences of the examined estimation approaches. We find that finite mixture models are quite capable of reproducing the unusual shape of the LGD distribution. However, out-of-sample the estimation error increases significantly. Model trees produce robust in-sample and out-of-sample estimations. Furthermore, {{we find that the}} improvement of advanced models increases with an increasing dataset. The second essay (Töws, 2014, The impact of debtor recovery on loss given default) addresses the economic consideration of the workout process of defaulted contracts. Dependent on the lessor’s workout strategy, defaulted contracts may develop in two distinct ways. Either the default reason can be dissolved and the debtor recovers or the contract must be written off. The study indicates the benefits of establishing the lessor’s expertise in assessing a defaulted <b>contract’s</b> <b>continuation</b> worthiness. If successfully implemented, the resulting workout process should produce lower LGDs than before and thereby strengthen the lenders competitiveness. The third essay (Miller and Töws, 2015, Loss given default-adjusted workout processes for leases) contributes to the LGD estimation literature considering unique features of leasing contracts. We economically account for leasing peculiarities and develop a particularly suited approach to estimate the leasing contracts’ LGD. We separate the LGD into its cash flows of the workout process of defaulted leasing contracts. We find that the estimated values of the parts of the LGD are sturdy indicators for the success of the workout process. Thus, the lessor can benefit from the consideration of both these forecasts for his actions concerning the workout process...|$|R
40|$|Finnish {{agri-food}} chain {{is going through}} many structural changes. Incomes of farms have decreased and thus the number of farms has declined. However, the average size of farms and numer of animals have grown. Production of rye has decreased but production of pork meat has increased steadily. Feed, bakery, meat, wholesale and trade sectors are concentrated and mostly national, but the market entry of foreign traders and processors has increased significantly suring last decade. Although large processing companies dominate in the sausage and rye bread markets, the significant majority of companies are small or medium-sized. The Finnish food markets are stable and saturated and the consumption do not increase, but food habits are becoming more uniform {{with those of other}} European consumers and health issues as well as organic food have become important factors in consumer choices. Globalisation, the tight competition situation and changes in consumption habits put also pressures on the Finnish {{agri-food chain}}. Thus, the Finnish pigmeat sector and bakery sector are relevant cases in point due to their recent structural changes and present market situation. Pork meat to sausage chain in Finland Structural features: The pigmeat chain has undergone significant structural changes in the past decade. The number of pig farms has declined and the trend is predicted to continue. At the same time, the number of sows and fattening pigs sold per farm has increased to achieve greater efficiency. Surplus production is mainly exported, because the pigmeat market in Finland is saturated. The price of pork meat largely corresponds with the EU average. The primary sector is seeking routes through which to achieve greater efficiencies due to problems of profitability. The processing industry and the retail sector are also continually seeking greater efficiency, for example through joint ventures abroad. Economic relationships: Pig producers are generally well organised with strong horizontal and vertical links. They have horizontal organisations, which represent their interests and raise their professional skills at the national and local level. Producers are owners of three dominant Pigmeat processing cooperatives who act as intermediaries for the commercialisation of meat between farmers and processors and processors and the retail trade. Also other private processors and producers have close and deep relations. In general the relationships are stable and confidential and both are eager to have close relationships to predict production and permit better negotiation with the trade. Also considerable development work, collaborations and integration can be found especially in cooperatives. Furthermore, both formal and informal relationships exist in the horizontal and vertical relations. In terms of producers and processors, the relationship includes almost always written and long-term contracts and there is a mutual trust between partners. With processors and retailers, the contracts are also written but with less trust and less balanced negotiation power than in producer – processor relationship. Still, trust is the important element, although the negotiations have become more complex and price dominates negotiations. However, the relationships are stable because of mutual dependency especially between big processors and retailers and quite long-term or at least there is a certainty of <b>continuation.</b> Communication: Written <b>contracts</b> are common in the Finnish pig chain, but personal contacts are appreciated among all partners because of feedback and deep information. The communication is often personal and regular, especially among farmers. Technology is widely used in communication in farms but also in pig houses and business: processors and retailers have electronic data exchange systems and the computer handles many routines especially in big enterprises. Information and communication technology (ICT) will be also part of the efficiency strategy which the Finnish sausage chain needs to stay in business. Influencing factors: The main influencing factors for the Finnish sausage chain are developments towards concentrations in the feed, the processing and the trade sectors. Also structural changes and competitiveness of domestic primary production and reductions of the financial support are very important. However, it is expected that consumers prefer to buy domestic sausage and pig meat in consumer packages from a multiple retail chain also in the future, as sausage {{is an important part of}} Finnish cuisine. Rye corn to rye bread chain in Finland Structural features: Rye consumption is the highest in northern growing areas, where rye is used in bread. While rye production in Finland has increased slightly in recent years, it has decreased on the long term. Because of low profitability, rye production is nowadays low compared with consumption of rye bread. The Finnish bakery industry consists of many small local bakeries, few medium-sized and few big bakeries. There are a few nationally known brands or products but people also prefer local products. The processing sector is going through structural changes because of overproduction and efficiency problems. Also the retail sector is suffering from price wars and hard competition, but it has resources to facilitate large horizontal or vertical collaborations. Economic relationships: Horizontal relationships among rye producers are strong. The relationship between producers and processor is also personal and stable and there is a certainty of continuation partly because of lack of actors. The power is not always in balance especially in a spot market situation, where more mistrust exists. Usually rye farmers trade with one or a few malt houses or mills and quite often they have written contracts. Contract relationships are often personal, stable and long-term or there is a certainty of continuation. Also mutual trust and collaborations among producers and between producers and processors are common. The relationships between bakery industry and mills can be characterised as stable, long-term, informal, confidential and personal. This might also be due to the lack of actors or because of habits and long-term personal contacts. Although bakeries and mills have a tendency to maintain stable relationships, the competition situation has put pressure on price negotiations. Two big bakeries dominate more than half of the market, although their power is limited. Horizontal cooperation among bakeries is insignificant. However, the relationship between retailers and processors is strong and strategic, for example there is information exchange regarding sales, trends and consumer behaviour. Retailers have very stable relations with local bakeries because of mutual dependence. Mutual trust and confidence, for example in delivery certainty are seen as important elements of a satisfying relationship. Many relationships are long-term, although contracts are not always long lasting. Because of tough competition, the negotiations between bakeries and retailers are complex, but the situation is hardest among small local bakeries. The retail sector has the highest negotiation power. Communication: Written contracts are common in the Finnish rye bread chain, but personal contacts are still appreciated among all partners because of feedback and deep information, for example in research and development (R&D). Contacts are often personal and regular, especially among farmers and between bakeries and retailers. Compared with the pig chain, the information flow is not as efficient and producers need to be more active in the search for information. Technology is widely used in communication and manufacturing processes. Processors and retail have electronic data exchange systems and computers handle routines especially in big enterprises. Influencing factors: The sustainability of rye production depends on price of rye and on the agricultural support received by farmers. A reduction in support or price will have significant consequences for the mill, malt and bakery industries because then nearly all raw materials have to be imported. Other threats to the rye-bread sector are a) centralisation of trade, b) hard competition between domestic and imported raw materials and products, c) high production costs in Finland, d) high costs of raw materials and e) decrease of consumption. However, consumers are interested in functional products, health issues and pre-cooked products. This coupled with consumers’ predilection for domestic products will be an important competition factor for the Finnish rye bread chain...|$|R
