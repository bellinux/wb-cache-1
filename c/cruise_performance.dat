5|$|The Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey is an American multi-mission, {{tiltrotor}} {{military aircraft}} with both vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL), and short takeoff and landing (STOL) capabilities. It {{is designed to}} combine the functionality of a conventional helicopter with the long-range, high-speed <b>cruise</b> <b>performance</b> of a turboprop aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Version with PT6A-135A engines, 750 shp flat rated to 550 shp, {{for better}} climb and <b>cruise</b> <b>performance,</b> 97 built.|$|E
25|$|The {{horsepower}} increase, {{with the}} new engines' limit of 2800rpm (up from 2575rpm), combined for much improved climb and <b>cruise</b> <b>performance.</b> The new aircraft also incorporated a one-piece windshield and a bare metal instrument panel instead of one covered with a removable plastic fascia; some models have electrically-actuated flaps. More than 930 Seneca IIIs were built; the last 37 Seneca IIIs built had a 28-volt electrical system rather than the 14-volt system of previous aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Foxx and <b>Cruise's</b> <b>performances</b> {{were widely}} praised, with Foxx being {{nominated}} for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. The film's editors, Jim Miller and Paul Rubell, were also {{nominated for the}} Academy Award for Best Film Editing.|$|R
500|$|Other critics {{thought that}} Tom Cruise did not [...] "make the grade" [...] as a German war hero. The film critic for Der Tagesspiegel wrote, [...] " [...] image {{as an actor}} has been finally ruined by Valkyrie... doesn't dare to be popcorn cinema {{and at the same}} time lacks any {{conceptual}} brilliance." [...] Hanns-Georg Rodek of Die Welt reported of <b>Cruise's</b> <b>performance,</b> [...] "He comes over best as an American hero, someone who battles for respect with aggression and energy. But Stauffenberg was a German hero, with aristocratic bearing, and Cruise cannot carry that off." [...] The Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung said <b>Cruise's</b> <b>performance</b> was [...] "credible", and reserved praise for the authenticity of the dubbed German-language version of the film over the original.|$|R
50|$|Mission: Impossible 2 was {{released}} in theaters worldwide on May 24, 2000. It grossed more than $546.4 million worldwide, becoming the highest grossing film of 2000. But the critical response was mixed; praise was directed at Tom <b>Cruise's</b> <b>performance</b> and the action sequences, but the plot and dialogue were criticized.|$|R
500|$|Early 767 {{customers}} {{were given the}} choice of Pratt & Whitney JT9D or General Electric CF6 turbofans, marking {{the first time that}} Boeing had offered more than one engine option at the launch of a new airliner. Both jet engine models had a maximum output of [...] of thrust. The engines were mounted approximately one-third the length of the wing from the fuselage, similar to previous wide-body trijets. The larger wings were designed using an aft-loaded shape which reduced aerodynamic drag and distributed lift more evenly across their surface span than any of the manufacturer's previous aircraft. The wings provided higher-altitude <b>cruise</b> <b>performance,</b> added fuel capacity, and expansion room for future stretched variants. The initial 767-200 was designed for sufficient range to fly across North America or across the northern Atlantic, and would be capable of operating routes up to [...]|$|E
500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{thorough}} redesign {{was of the}} wing, the objective being to match {{the performance of the}} cancelled AV-16 while retaining the Pegasus engine of the AV-8A. Engineers designed a new, one-piece supercritical wing, which improves <b>cruise</b> <b>performance</b> by delaying the rise in drag and increasing lift-to-drag ratio. Made of composites, the wing is thicker and has a longer span than that of the AV-8A. Compared to the AV-8A's wing, it has a higher aspect ratio, reduced sweep (from 40° to 37°), and an area increased from [...] to [...] The wing has a high-lift configuration, employing flaps that deploy automatically when maneuvering, and drooped ailerons. Using the leading edge root extensions, the new wing allows for a 6,700lb (3,035kg) increase in payload compared with the first-generation Harriers after a 1,000ft (300m) takeoff roll. Because the wing is almost exclusively composite, it is [...] lighter than the AV-8A's smaller wing.|$|E
2500|$|In 1994, the [...] "New" [...] Piper Aircraft company {{introduced}} the Seneca IV, having achieved certification on 17 November 1993. This model {{was similar to}} the Seneca III offering minor improvements, such as a streamlined engine cowl for increased <b>cruise</b> <b>performance.</b> It continued to use the counter-rotating Continental TSIO-360-KB engines and gross weights remained unchanged. A total of 71 Seneca IVs were built.|$|E
5000|$|Oblivion {{received}} mixed reviews. The acting, especially <b>Cruise's</b> <b>performance,</b> the originality, {{the visual}} style and effects were praised, while {{reception of the}} plot was mixed. Reviewers criticized the film's incorporation of elements from other sci-fi films and what Rotten Tomatoes called a [...] "thinly scripted" [...] story. However, it was a modest commercial success, grossing $286 million worldwide against a $160 million budget.|$|R
50|$|Wing loading has {{an effect}} on an aircraft's climb rate. A lighter loaded wing will have a {{superior}} rate of climb compared to a heavier loaded wing as less airspeed is required to generate the additional lift to increase altitude. A lightly loaded wing has a more efficient <b>cruising</b> <b>performance</b> because less thrust is required to maintain lift for level flight. However, a heavily loaded wing is more suited for higher speed flight because smaller wings offer less drag.|$|R
25|$|Improved DA42 {{introduced}} in March 2012 with new propeller and aerodynamic clean-ups to the rudder and engine cowling, resulting in greatly increased <b>cruise</b> speed <b>performance.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In March 2014 it was {{announced}} that the intended Lycoming IO-390 powerplant will be replaced by a six-cylinder Lycoming IO-540. The change was made due to Lycoming Engines not planning to certify the IO-390 for automotive fuel as an option. The IO-540 will provide the same <b>cruise</b> <b>performance</b> and fuel economy, but weighs [...] more. However, it will allow the Panthera's gross weight to be increased by [...] {{to make up for the}} extra weight. The aircraft will use the existing cowling, which was originally designed to accommodate a six-cylinder engine anyway.|$|E
2500|$|Although tiltrotors {{such as the}} Focke-Achgelis Fa 269 of the mid-1940s and the Centro Técnico Aeroespacial [...] "Convertiplano" [...] of the 1950s reached testing or mock-up stages, the V-22 Osprey is {{considered}} the world's first production tiltrotor aircraft. It has one three-bladed proprotor, turboprop engine, and transmission nacelle mounted on each wingtip. The Osprey is a multi-mission aircraft with both a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) and short takeoff and landing capability (STOL). It is designed to perform missions like a conventional helicopter with the long-range, high-speed <b>cruise</b> <b>performance</b> of a turboprop aircraft. The FAA classifies the Osprey {{as a model of}} powered lift aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] {{extension}} seats 40 {{more with}} 40% more premium area. The A350-1000 has an 11-frame stretch over the −900 and {{will feature a}} slightly larger wing than the −800/900 models; a trailing-edge extension increasing its area by 4%. This will extend the high-lift devices and the ailerons, making the chord bigger by around 400mm, optimising flap lift performance as well as <b>cruise</b> <b>performance.</b> The main landing gear is a 6-wheel bogie instead of a 4-wheel bogie, put in a one frame longer bay, and the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engine thrust is augmented to [...] These and other engineering upgrades are necessary so that the −1000 model does not suffer a reduction in range.|$|E

40|$|A {{program has}} been {{undertaken}} to develop new airfoil sections suitable for general aviation aircraft, utilizing theoretical and experimental advanced technology developed in recent years primarily for subsonic jet transport and military aircraft. The airfoil development program is one component of the Advanced Technology Light Twin program sponsored by NASA Langley Research Center. Two-dimensional tests of a new airfoil have demonstrated high <b>cruising</b> <b>performance</b> over a fairly wide C sub 1 range, and a C sub 1 max value of 3. 69 with Fowler flap and no leading-edge devices. Experimental and theoretical development of additional configurations is under way...|$|R
50|$|As speeds {{approach}} {{the speed of}} sound, the additional phenomenon of wave drag appears. This is a powerful form of drag that begins at transonic speeds (around Mach 0.88). Around Mach 1, the peak coefficient of drag is four times that of subsonic drag. Above the transonic range, the coefficient drops dramatically again, although remains 20% higher by Mach 2.5 than at subsonic speeds. Supersonic aircraft must have considerably more power than subsonic aircraft require to overcome this wave drag, and although <b>cruising</b> <b>performance</b> above transonic speed is more efficient, it is still less efficient than flying subsonically.|$|R
2500|$|In response, {{almost without}} exception, these pilots {{specified}} {{their desire for}} tremendous extra power [...] and STOL performance, in a design that could be easily fitted with wheels, skis or floats. When de Havilland engineers noted this would result in poor <b>cruise</b> <b>performance,</b> one pilot replied, [...] "You only have to be faster than a dog sled to be a winner". Other suggestions that were seemingly mundane, but important in the bush plane world, included the installation of full-sized doors {{on both sides of}} the aircraft, which meant that it could be readily loaded no matter which side of a dock it tied up on; the doors were also made wide enough to allow for a 44 Imperial gallon drum to be rolled up into the aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|The {{score for}} Twin Peaks has {{received}} acclaim; The Guardian wrote that it [...] "still marks {{the summit of}} TV soundtracks." [...] In fall 1989, composer Angelo Badalamenti and Lynch created the score for the show. In 20 minutes they produced the signature theme for the series. Badalamenti called it the [...] "Love Theme from Twin Peaks". Lynch told him, [...] "You just wrote 75% of the score. It's {{the mood of the}} whole piece. It is Twin Peaks." [...] While creating the score, Lynch often described the moods or emotions he wanted the music to evoke, and Badalamenti began to play the piano. In the scenes dominated by young men, they are accompanied by music that Badalamenti called Cool Jazz. The characters' masculinity was enhanced by finger-snapping, [...] "cocktail-lounge electric piano, pulsing bass, and lightly brushed percussion." [...] A handful of the motifs were borrowed from the Julee Cruise album Floating into the Night, which was written in large part by Badalamenti and Lynch and was released in 1989. This album also serves as the soundtrack to another Lynch project, Industrial Symphony No. 1, a live <b>Cruise</b> <b>performance</b> also featuring Michael J. Anderson ("The Man from Another Place").|$|E
