A line has to be reconfigured if a new product has to be produced by an existing line or any changes in product characteristics occur. In such cases, new operations have to be integrated on existing equipment while some previously assigned operations are deleted. Since transfer lines consist of a sequence of unit head machines, their reconfiguration {{is not an easy}} issue because of numerous constraints on <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> to be taken into account. In this paper, a Mixed Integer Program is proposed for solving this problem with objective to minimize the cost of the final line configuration. An illustrative example is presented...|$|R

The main {{difference from the}} standard simple assembly line balancing problem {{is the fact that}} the operations are grouped into blocks. All <b>of</b> the <b>operations</b> in the same block are carried out simultaneously by one piece of equipment (spindle head) and all the blocks at the same workstation are executed sequentially. The set of all available spindle heads (possible blocks <b>of</b> <b>operation)</b> is given beforehand. The constraints on <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> and blocks at the same workstations are taken into account. The problem how to obtain the optimal choice and assignments of blocks to workstations to provides a minimal estimated line cost (via the sum of the blocks and workstations costs). In addition, the precedence, cycle time and compatibility constraints must be satisfied as well. The objective of the paper is to aid manufactures in reducing both space and costs. A new lower bound based on solving a special set partitioning problem is developped and a branch-and-bound algorithm is designed.

40|$|In this paper, we {{have studied}} the {{axiomatics}} of Ann-categories and categorical rings. These are the categories with distributivity constraints whose axiomatics are similar with those of ring structures. The main result we have achieved is proving {{the independence of the}} axiomatics of Ann-category definition. And then we have proved that after adding an axiom into the definition of categorical rings, we obtain the new axiomatics which is equivalent to the one of Ann-categories. In [PJ], authors modified the definition of Ann-categories to be the one of categorical rings, where the condition Ann- 1 is omitted, and the <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>operation</b> with the associativity and commutativity is replaced with the <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>operation</b> with the "associativity - commutativity" constraint. This replacement is to make it more convenient in using Mac Lane cohomology. However, the fact that the definition of categorical rings and Ann-categories are equivalent is still an open question. In [q], authors showed that the set of Ann-categories is a subset of the set of categorical rings. And these sets coincide if and only if the condition (U) is satisfied. Comment: 14 page...|$|R
40|$|Fast and {{effective}} exploration {{at the early}} stages of the design flow can yield significant improve-ment in the quality of the design and substantial reduction in design time. In this paper, we present an efficient technique to evaluate the power dissipation of scheduled Data Flow Graphs (DFGs). Scheduling dictates the <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> with respect to their assignments to functional units. Generally for scheduled DFGs, this relation is captured in the form of a comparability graph. As a consequence, the topology of the comparability graph determines the solution space available to the subsequent binding stage. In this work, our main contribution is a technique to assess the inherent flexibility of the schedules we start with. We developed early evaluation metrics in order to assess the degree of flexibility inherent in an initial schedule that will eventually affect the qual-ity of the binding solution. Every schedule is associated with a compatibility graph that represents the conflicts and compatibilities among operations with respect to possible binding decisions. Our metric based evaluation technique is based on several properties (such as edge connectivity, edge weight distribution, etc.) <b>of</b> these <b>compatibility</b> graphs. These metrics essentially reflect the amount of freedom that is provided to the binding stage, which enables early assessment and relative comparison of different possible schedules without actually performing the resource-binding step...|$|R

30|$|The {{supplier}} selection problem {{becomes even}} more complicated {{in the era of}} MC since a certain level of adaptability and robustness is necessary when operating within a volatile and rapidly changing environment. The most commonly used criteria in supplier selection studies include quality and performance [42]. However, when having to deal with unpredictability and fluctuating demand, which are common in MC, additional factors need to be considered such as management <b>compatibility,</b> transparency <b>of</b> <b>operations,</b> strategic direction, reliability, and agility [43]. While trying to adhere to eco-friendliness directives, frameworks like the one proposed in [44] incorporate environmental footprint criteria to green supply chain design.

40|$|Some {{cognitive}} theories (e. g., Thagard and Stewart 2011, Eliasmith 2013) {{claim that}} {{various aspects of}} cognition {{can be explained by}} applying the operations underlying HRRs to modal representations. Doubts based on theoretical considerations have however been raised regarding the <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> HRR <b>operations</b> and modal representations (Fisher et al. 1987). This paper aims to provide a qualitative test for the claim that HRR operations can be used with modal representations. Our results are mostly positive, while not entirely settling the issue. All types of representations (whether randomly or modally generated) processed with HRR operations fare better in high dimensions as opposed to lower dimensions. However, while the performance of modal representations remains acceptable in high dimensions, there is a distinct degradation of performance with this type of representations. Moreover, the standardization process in such cases plays a greater role than it should considering its low neural plausibility...|$|R

40|$|As known, for {{the ring}} structure, the two properties: {{association}} and commutation respect to +, {{can be replaced}} with the “association-commutation” property: (a + b) + (c + d) = (a + c) + (b + d). This leads to two ways to construct the ring cohomology: cohomology for rings which are regarded as algebras due to Shukla [Sh], and ring cohomology due to Mac Lane [Mac]. The ring structure has been categorized by the definition of an Ann-category [4]. Each congruence class of Ann-categories {{is characterized by a}} cohomology class of structures (Theorem 4. 3 [4]). For regular Ann-categories, this class is (R, M) (Theorem 4. 4 [5]). In the general case, this bijective to the group H 3 Sh group is replaced with the group H 3 Mac (R, M) (Theorem 7. 6 [7]). In [1], authors have modified the definition of an Ann-category to be the one of a categorical ring, where the condition (Ann- 1) is omitted, and the <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>operation</b> ⊗ with the associativity and commutativity constraints respect to + is replaced with the <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>operation</b> ⊗ with the “associativity- commutativity ” constraint. Categorical rings have been classified by the Mac Lane cohomology group H 3 Mac (R, M). There are 2 problems emerged: Firstly, do the sets of categorical rings and Ann-categories coincide? Secondly, in the case that these sets can not be proved to coincide, is it possible to prove the existence of the bijection between the set of congruence classes of pre-sticked Ann-categories of the type (R, M) and the group H 3 Mac (R, M) ? We have completely solved both of these problems. In [6], authors have showed that the set of Ann-categories is a subset of the set of categorical rings, and these two sets coincide if and only if the operation ⊗ in each categorical ring is compatible with the unitivity constraints <b>of</b> the <b>operation</b> ⊕. (This condition is also called the condition (U)). A question is raised: May the condition (U) be deduced from the axiomatics of a categorical ring? The second problem has been solved in [7]. After that, in [2], authors have proved that the condition (U) is always satisfied in a categorical ring, and therefore the two sets of the categories coincide. However, authors have made a mistake in the proof of the Lemma. 1 2 O...|$|R

The semantic compatibility function and other similar extensions are added to a TP architecture that originally knows only read/write two-phase locking. The resulting system supports the combination of a variety of representative SBCC protocols including: commutativity [?], recoverability [?], cooperative serializability [?], and epsilon serializability [?].
