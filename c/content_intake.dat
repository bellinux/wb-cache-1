40|$|White clover {{is one of}} {{the most}} nutritious species {{available}} in grassland/ruminant production systems. In association with grass, this species increases protein, mineral <b>content,</b> <b>intake</b> and nutrient value of the total forage. Because of its nitrogen fixing capacity, white clover has the potential to reduce, or in the case of organic systems, eliminate the need for inorganic nitrogen fertilizer on grazed grassland. Grassland-based animal production is a major part of the Irish agricultural economy, consequently any improvement in this legume has large potential benefit in this sector. The background, methodology, objectives and output of the current Teagasc, Oak Park white clover breeding programme are outlined. Five varieties have been released and are currently on Recommended Lists in Ireland and elsewhere. Aran, first released in 1981, has remained the highest yielding clover variety in UK trials, it is also widely grown in New Zealand, Australia and France as well as Ireland and UK. Avoca has shown very good yield and persistency under a range of managements and is widely used in Ireland and UK. Chieftain, the most recently released variety, has given 25 % more clover yield than the control under lax defoliation (simulated grazing) management in UK Recommended List trials.

40|$|Woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) are {{an iconic}} species of boreal and montane ecosystems, but many populations are declining due to habitat {{alteration}} and associated changes in predator-prey dynamics. Summer forage, however, influences lactation, juvenile growth, pregnancy, and survival, thereby affecting individuals and populations. I used tame caribou (of three nutritional classes — lactating, non-lactating, yearling) as a habitat assessment tool, at 135 sites across northeastern British Columbia, to determine: food habits and selection; dry matter intake rates; diet quality; and daily nutrient intakes. My {{goal was to}} assess the suitability of nutritional resources in boreal and montane plant communities to support energy and protein requirements of caribou during summer. Caribou were highly selective foragers. Deciduous shrubs were the primary summer forage of caribou; forbs, lichens, and mushrooms were secondary dietary items. Intake rates by caribou increased with increasing bite masses and quantities of accepted forage biomass (vegetation species used proportionately more than or equal to availability). Caribou achieved highest intakes at sites with an abundance of selected deciduous shrubs (e. g., willow-alpine sites, young forests) that afforded large bite masses, whereas lowest intakes occurred where mean bite masses were small (e. g., dry alpine, nutrient-poor forests). Dietary digestible energy (DE) and protein (DP) <b>content,</b> <b>intake</b> rates, and foraging time varied across plant communities and among nutritional classes. Caribou increased foraging time, but could not compensate for low intake rates and some plant communities failed to provide caribou with adequate nutrient intakes to support nutritional demands for lactation and maintenance of body mass. Although highest nutrient intakes were associated with productive sites, predation risk and disturbance may constrain the nutritional benefits caribou can acquire from these sites. In a pilot study, I mapped foodscapes of DE and DP intakes for a herd of free-ranging boreal caribou. Caribou did not select for nutrient intakes, but other factors including food quantity, predation risk, and accuracy of spatial data layers, may have confounded my ability to isolate the role of nutrition in habitat selection.

We also measured abdominal circumference, percent of body fat and resting metabolic rate. Results Overweight and obese patients, compared to normal weight, have a significant increased intake of vitamin A (p= 0. 002), vitamin B 1 (p= 0. 037), vitamin B 5 (p= 0. 047), vitamin C (p= 0. 029) and vitamin D (p= 0. 015), sodium (p= 0. 036), iron (p= 0. 032) and selenium (p= 0. 007).

40|$|Decreasing dietary sodium intake, {{which can}} be {{achieved}} by reducing salt content in food, is recommended. Salt contributes to the taste of foods and makes them more enjoyable. Whether a food is liked or disliked is an important determinant of food intake, especially among children. However, the role of salt in children’s food acceptance has received little attention. The impact of salt content on children’s hedonic rating and intake of two foods was investigated in children. Using a within-subject crossover design, we recruited 75 children (8 – 11 years) to participate in five lunches in their school cafeteria. The target foods were green beans and pasta. The added salt content was 0, 0. 6 or 1. 2 g/ 100 g. The children’s intake (g) of all lunch items was measured. The children provided their hedonic rating of the food, a preference ranking and a saltiness ranking in the laboratory. Children could rank the foods according to salt content, and they preferred the two saltier options. A food-specific effect of salt <b>content</b> on <b>intake</b> was observed. Compared to the intermediate level (0. 6 g salt/ 100 g), not adding salt decreased green bean intake (221 %; p = 0. 002), and increasing the salt <b>content</b> increased pasta <b>intake</b> (+ 24 %; p, 0. 0001). Structural Equation Modeling was used to model the relative weights of the determinants of intake. It showed that the primary driver of food intake was the child’s hunger; the second most important factor was the child’s hedonic rating of the food, regardless of its salt content, and the last factor was the child’s preference for the particular salt content of the food.

Objective: The authors hypothesized that a system of DEBM energy content categorization and distribution would improve energy intake from DEBM. Methods: We compared infants’ actual cumulative energy intake with projected energy intake, had they been fed using our proposed system. Eighty-five milk samples were ranked by energy content. The bottom, middle, and top tertiles were classified as red, amber, and green energy content categories, respectively. Data on 378 feeding days from 20 babies who received this milk were analyzed. Total daily intake of DEBM was calculated in mL/kg/day and similarly ranked. Infants received red energy content milk, with DEBM intake in the bottom daily volume intake tertile; amber energy <b>content</b> milk, with <b>intake</b> in the middle daily volume intake tertile; and green energy <b>content</b> milk when <b>intake</b> reached the top daily volume intake tertile. Results: Actual median cumulative energy intake from DEBM was 1612 (range, 15 - 11 182) kcal.

The primary food was willow buds and twigs (foraging occurrence of 83 %). The Kangding willow Salix paraplesia was most preferred, whereas the Sichuan willow S. hylonoma was most avoided, and feeding preference (foraging occurrence/food abundance) among the six main willow species was negatively correlated with the tannin content of the plant consumed rather than the protein, lipid, phosphorus, calcium, ash, fibre, or energy <b>contents.</b> The <b>intake</b> rates of dried biomass, energy, protein, fibre and tannin in different willow species were closely related to the bud sizes of these species.

Decreasing dietary sodium intake, which can be achieved by reducing salt content in food, is recommended. Salt contributes to the taste of foods and makes them more enjoyable. Whether a food is liked or disliked is an important determinant of food intake, especially among children. However, the role of salt in children's food acceptance has received little attention. The impact of salt content on children's hedonic rating and intake of two foods was investigated in children. Using a within-subject crossover design, we recruited 75 children (8 – 11 years) to participate in five lunches in their school cafeteria. The target foods were green beans and pasta. The added salt content was 0, 0. 6 or 1. 2 g/ 100 g. The children's intake (g) of all lunch items was measured. The children provided their hedonic rating of the food, a preference ranking and a saltiness ranking in the laboratory. Children could rank the foods according to salt content, and they preferred the two saltier options. A food-specific effect of salt <b>content</b> on <b>intake</b> was observed. Compared to the intermediate level (0. 6 g salt/ 100 g), not adding salt decreased green bean intake (− 21 %; p = 0. 002), and increasing the salt <b>content</b> increased pasta <b>intake</b> (+ 24 %; p< 0. 0001). Structural Equation Modeling was used to model the relative weights of the determinants of intake. It showed that the primary driver of food intake was the child's hunger; the second most important factor was the child's hedonic rating of the food, regardless of its salt content, and the last factor was the child's preference for the particular salt content of the food. In conclusion, salt content has a positive and food-specific effect on intake; it impacted food preferences and intake differently in children. Taking into account children's preferences for salt instead of their intake may lead to excessive added salt...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe adipocyte-derived {{cytokine}} leptin {{acts as a}} metabolic switch, {{connecting the}} body's metabolism to high energy consuming processes such as reproduction and immune responses. Accumulating evidence suggests that leptin {{plays a role in}} human pathologies like autoimmune diseases and cancer, thus providing a rationale for the development of leptin antagonists. In this study, we generated and evaluated a panel of neutralizing nanobodies targeting the leptin receptor (LR). A nanobody comprises the variable domain of the naturally occurring single-chain antibodies found in members of the Camelidae family. We identified three classes of neutralizing nanobodies targeting different LR subdomains: i. e. the CRH 2, Ig-like and FNIII domains. Only nanobodies directed against the CRH 2 domain inhibited leptin binding. We could show that a nanobody that targets the Ig-like domain potently interfered with leptin-dependent regulation of hypothalamic neuropeptide Y expression. As a consequence, daily intraperitoneal injection increased body weight, body fat <b>content,</b> food <b>intake,</b> liver size and serum insulin levels. All these characteristics resemble the phenotype of leptin and LR deficient animals. Our data support proposed models of the activated LR complex, and demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} block LR signalling without affecting ligand binding. These nanobodies form new tools to study the mechanisms of blood-brain-barrier leptin transport and the effect of LR inhibition in disease models...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{provided}} limited {{evidence for a}} harmful effect of high glycemic index and dietary glycemic load on cancer. The authors analyzed associations among glycemic index, glycemic load, and risk of cancer in {{women and men in}} the National Institutes of Health–AARP Diet and Health Study. Published glycemic index values were assigned to 225 foods/food groups. Glycemic load was calculated by multiplying the glycemic index, carbohydrate <b>content,</b> and <b>intake</b> frequency of individual foods reported on a food frequency questionnaire. From 1995 through 2003, the authors identified 15, 215 and 33, 203 cancer cases in women and men, respectively. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate multivariate relative risks and 95 % confidence intervals. For women and men, respectively, the relative risks for total cancer for high versus low glycemic index were 1. 03 (Ptrend[*]=[*] 0. 217) and 1. 04 (Ptrend[*]=[*] 0. 012) and, for glycemic load, were 0. 90 (Ptrend[*]=[*] 0. 024) and 0. 93 (Ptrend = 0. 01). Associations with total cancer held only among the overweight for glycemic index and among those of healthy weight for glycemic load. These findings suggest that glycemic index and glycemic load are not strong predictors of cancer incidence. The direction and small magnitude of associations might be explained by the manner in which high glycemic index and glycemic load track with overall diet and lifestyle patterns...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the effect of Gelidium amansii (GA) on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in rats with high fructose (HF) diet (57. 1 % w/w). Five-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a HF diet to induce glucose intolerance and hyperlipidemia. The experiment was divided into three groups: (1) control diet group (Con); (2) HF diet group (HF); and (3) HF with GA diet group (HF +  5 % GA). The rats were fed the experimental diets and drinking water ad libitum for 23  weeks. The results showed that GA significantly decreased retroperitoneal fat mass weight of HF diet-fed rats. Supplementation of GA caused a decrease in plasma glucose, insulin, tumor necrosis factor-α, and leptin. HF diet increased hepatic lipid <b>content.</b> However, <b>intake</b> of GA reduced the accumulation of hepatic lipids including total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride contents. GA elevated the excretion of fecal lipids and bile acid in HF diet-fed rats. Furthermore, GA significantly decreased plasma TC, triglyceride, low density lipoprotein plus very low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and TC/high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio in HF diet-fed rats. HF diet induced an in plasma glucose and an impaired glucose tolerance, but GA supplementation decreased homeostasis model assessment equation-insulin resistance and improved impairment of glucose tolerance. Taken together, these results indicate that supplementation of GA can improve the impairment of glucose and lipid metabolism in an HF diet-fed rat model...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to reveal the actual {{conditions}} of dyschezia as recognized by postoperative rectal cancer patients and their self-care, as well as the subjective QOL （Schedule for the Evaluation of Individual Quality of Life-Direct Weighting: SEIQoL-DW）, and to obtain suggestions for the nursing intervention for improving the self-care of dyschezia and QOL. The subjects were 88 patients （age: 62. 2 ± 9. 3 years）, consisting of 33 and 55 patients that received intersphincteric resection （ISR） and low anterior resection （LAR）, respectively. The mean of the SEIQoL-DW index was 66. 7 ± 15. 3 for ISR and 63. 8 ± 14. 8 for LAR, showing no significant difference. The dyschezia was grouped into seven categories such as [frequent defecation], [irregular number of defecations], [defecation on oral drug administration], [frequent nocturnal defecation], [fecal incontinence], and [anal pain]. The proportions of [irregular number of defecations], [frequent nocturnal defecation], and [fecal incontinence] were significantly higher for ISR than LAR. The self-care of dyschezia can be summarized into eleven categories such as [washing anus], [applying diapers and pads], [controlling dietary intake], and [controlling defecation]. In conclusion, it is important to understand in detail the fecal control, local anal care, food <b>content,</b> and <b>intake</b> method as nursing interventions using a checklist, and to instruct the patients individually in cooperation with physicians and physical therapists...|$|R
