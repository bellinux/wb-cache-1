40|$|Analysis of <b>climatological</b> <b>observation</b> {{temperature}} data reveals {{that during the}} southwesterly monsoon, there exists a low temperature zone east of Vietnam. It cools down from June to August and warms up in September. Meanwhile, during this period, the cold water mass spreads eastward to the deep basin. Numerical experiments validate the results of data analysis and further verify {{that there are two}} basic factors that induce the Vietnam cold water. The major one is the strong local positive wind stress curl, which leads to the divergence of sea surface water and the upward supplement of lower layer water in the deep basin. Another minor one is the alongshore component of southwesterly monsoon, which drives the offshore Ekman transport and coastal upwelling in the shallow region along the Vietnam coast. In addition, the negative wind stress curl in the southern South China Sea inputs negative vorticity to the ocean and drives a strong anticyclonic gyre, which affects the spatial distribution of the cold water evidently...|$|E
40|$|Lake Vrana is {{a natural}} {{oligotrophic}} lake situated {{on the island of}} Cres (northeastern Adriatic Sea). Its macrophytic flora and vegetation were studied in 2010, nearly 50 years after the first comprehensive research on it. Vegetation of vascular plants, including belts of helophytes and submersed vegetation, dominates in the shallowest water. Charophytic vegetation starts to develop at the depth of approximately 8 m and is present in three clear zones dominated by Chara aculeolata, Ch. virgata and Nitella opaca, reaching a final depth of 30 m. The lake and its vegetation belong to habitat type 3140 (hard oligo-mesotrophic waters with benthic vegetation of Chara species), protected by the Habitat Directive. Due to the presence of several charophyte species endangered in the Balkans and Europe, the lake is an important site for the conservation of charophytes at the national and European levels. Great changes in the water regime over the last decades due to increase of water temperature and overexploitation of the lake’s water are exerting a strong negative effect on this protected special reserve.

40|$|High spatio-temporal {{resolution}} monitoring {{has only}} been progressively developed in the Rhine–Meuse basins {{over the last few}} decades. As a consequence, basic hydrological information can be very scarce in some areas. In regions which are homogeneous from a hydroclimatological and physiogeographical point of view, hydrographs can be reproduced via regionalized hydrological models, provided that <b>climatological</b> <b>observation</b> series are available. The Alzette river basin, monitored since the mid- 1990 s by a very dense hydroclimatological observation network, had been chosen in the framework of the IRMA-SPONGE project FRHYMAP for transposing the conceptual hydrological models HRM and SOCONT and regionalizing their parameters. The regionalized models were to be used both for extending the currently available runoff series and evaluating runoff in neighbouring non-monitored basins. The 16 monitored sub-basins of the Alzette, reflecting the physiogeographical diversity of the study area, were divided into two subsets, serving for both the calibration and the validation procedures. Once the transposition of the models to the Alzette basin had been successfully assessed, their parameters were linked to the physiogeographical characteristics of the sub-basins. The performance of the thus regionalized models was assessed via a validation on a subset of basins that had not been retained for the elaboration of the regional parameter sets. The transposition of the HRM and SOCONT model to the Alzette river basin was completed successfully. Results overall proved to be satisfying, with the HRM model performing equally well for low flows and high flows, while the SOCONT model showed best results for high flows and a systematic overestimation of the mean discharge. Both models proved to be adequate for evaluating daily runoff in non-monitored basins of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg, helping thus to counterbalance the considerable lack of hydrological observation series {{in this part of the}} Rhine basin...|$|E

40|$|A global ocean {{circulation}} model is formulated {{in terms of}} the “residual mean ” and used to study eddy–mean flow interaction. Adjoint techniques are used to compute the three-dimensional eddy stress field that minimizes the departure of the coarse-resolution model from <b>climatological</b> <b>observations</b> of temperature. The resulting 3 D maps of eddy stress and residual-mean circulation yield a wealth of infor-mation about the role of eddies in large-scale {{ocean circulation}}. In eddy-rich regions such as the Southern Ocean, the Kuroshio, and the Gulf Stream, eddy stresses have an amplitude comparable to the wind stress, of order 0. 2 N m 2, and carry momentum from the surface down to the bottom, where they are balanced by mountain form drag. From the optimized eddy stress, 3 D maps of horizontal eddy diffusivity are inferred. The diffusivities have a well-defined large-scale structure whose prominent features are 1) large values of (up to 4000 m 2 s 1) in the western boundary currents and on the equatorial flank of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and 2) a surface intensification of, suggestive of a dependence on the stratification N 2.

40|$|Abstract: A {{drawback}} of medium-to-long-term {{probabilistic forecasting}} methods is {{the relatively high}} uncertainty associated with model outputs, particularly when the models are used for prediction of future scenarios. This paper presents an extension to the probabilistic forecasting approach first presented in Sharma (2000 b), that attempts to enhance {{the reliability of the}} model using an ensemble averaging approach. Each ensemble member or model is formulated using nonparametric statistical techniques and is restricted to have a relatively independent basis so as to represent the multiple mechanisms that influence the system being studied. The aim of using ensemble or model averaging is to reduce the chance of model misspecification, a common occurrence when the dependence is highly random and the system too complex to be explained by a limited number of predictors. The usefulness of the procedure is demonstrated through an application to forecast the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), the multiple models being formulated using predictors selected from prior lags of the SOI and globally distributed, gridded sea surface temperature anomaly data. The model is assessed by evaluating its performance both in cross-validation as well as by forecasting an entire period of the record that was left out in the model formulation process. The results indicate that the consideration of uncertainty in <b>climatological</b> <b>observations</b> and the use of an ensemble of model outputs results in probabilistic forecasts that are more reliable and accurate than is the case otherwise. The implications of using the probabilistic forecasts for water resources management are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of the Peru-Chile upwelling system (PCUS) are primarily driven by alongshore wind stress and curl, like in other eastern boundary upwelling systems. Previous {{studies have suggested that}} upwelling-favorable winds would increase under climate change, due to an enhancement of the thermally-driven cross-shore pressure gradient. Using an atmospheric model on a stretched grid with increased horizontal resolution in the PCUS, a dynamical downscaling of climate scenarios from a global coupled general circulation model (CGCM) is performed to investigate the processes leading to sea-surface wind changes. Downscaled winds associated with present climate show reasonably good agreement with <b>climatological</b> <b>observations.</b> Downscaled winds under climate change show a strengthening off central Chile south of 35 A degrees S (at 30 A degrees S- 35 A degrees S) in austral summer (winter) and a weakening elsewhere. An alongshore momentum balance shows that the wind slowdown (strengthening) off Peru and northern Chile (off central Chile) is associated with a decrease (an increase) in the alongshore pressure gradient. Whereas the strengthening off Chile is likely due to the poleward displacement and intensification of the South Pacific Anticyclone, the slowdown off Peru may be associated with increased precipitation over the tropics and associated convective anomalies, as suggested by a vorticity budget analysis. On the other hand, an increase in the land-sea temperature difference is not found to drive similar changes in the cross-shore pressure gradient. Results from another atmospheric model with distinct CGCM forcing and climate scenarios suggest that projected wind changes off Peru are sensitive to concurrent changes in sea surface temperature and rainfall...|$|R

The magnitude {{of the changes in}} available solar radiation due to the use of different covering materials and their effects on leaf temperatures are presented using a dynamic greenhouse climate model. Transmittances in the whole solar and PAR bands under laboratory conditions were similar, ranging from 60 % to 85 %, while those in the thermal infrared ranged from 20 % to 60 %. Transmittance values found in the greenhouse were similar to those found for horizontal sheets under laboratory conditions. In order to generalise on the effects of different plastics on actual leaf temperatures, the Gembloux Dynamic Greenhouse Climate Model (GDGCM) was used to simulate air temperature and humidity, leaf temperature and the solar radiation {{at the top of the}} canopy using <b>climatological</b> <b>observations</b> and the radiometric properties measured under laboratory conditions as inputs. The model gave values of up to - 5 degrees C and + 1 degrees C for the extreme leaf to air temperature differences close to midday and sunrise, respectively.

40|$|Although many {{long-term}} {{simulations of}} snow accumulation and oblation {{have been made}} using stand-alone land surface models and surface models coupled with GCMs, less {{research has focused on}} short-term event simulations. Actually, accurate event simulations of snow-related processes are the basis for successful long-term simulation. Three advantages of event simulations of snowfall and snow melting are availability of: (1) intensive observation data from field experiments for validation; (2) more physically-realistic precipitation schemes for use in atmospheric models to simulate snowfall; and (3) a more detailed analysis of the snow melting processes. In addition to the complexities of snow related processes themselves, terrain-induced effects on snowfall/snow melting make simulations of snow events more difficult. <b>Climatological</b> <b>observations</b> indicate that terrain features such as the Black Hills of South Dakota and Wyoming can exert important effects on snow accumulation and snow oblation processes. One of the primary effects is that the orography causes forced uplift of airflow and causes atmospheric waves to form both upwind and downwind of it. Airflow often splits around the obstacle, converging on the lee side. This convergence may lead to precipitation enhancement. It also provides an elevated heat and moisture source that enhances atmospheric instability. During the period of April 5 -May 5, 1999, the Upper Missouri River Basin Pilot Project (UMRBPP) made intensive observations on precipitation events occurring in the Black Hills. Two moderate snowfall events were captured during the period. The resulting high temporal and spatial resolution data provides opportunities to investigate terrain effects on snowfall amount, distribution, and melting. Successful simulation of snowfall amount, distribution, and evolution using atmospheric models is important to subsequent modeling of snow melting using snow sub-models in land surface schemes. In this paper, a coupled model system, consisting of an atmosphere model (ARPS) and a land-surface model (revised NCAR LSM), is used to simulate one of these UMRBPP cases...|$|R

In this manuscript, we focus on evaluating the ocean and land carbon cycle components of the NorESM, based on the control and historical simulations. Many of the observed large scale ocean biogeochemical features are reproduced satisfactorily by the NorESM. When compared to the climatological estimates from the World Ocean Atlas (WOA), the model simulated temperature, salinity, oxygen, and phosphate distributions agree reasonably well in both the surface layer and deep water structure. However, the model simulates a relatively strong overturning circulation strength that leads to noticeable model-data bias, especially within the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). This strong overturning circulation slightly distorts {{the structure of the}} biogeochemical tracers at depth. Advancements in simulating the oceanic mixed layer depth with respect to the previous generation model particularly improve the surface tracer distribution as well as the upper ocean biogeochemical processes, particularly in the Southern Ocean. Consequently, near surface ocean processes such as biological production and air-sea gas exchange, are in good agreement with <b>climatological</b> <b>observations.</b> NorESM reproduces the general pattern of land-vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP) when compared to the observationally-based values derived from the FLUXNET network of eddy covariance towers. Globally, the NorESM simulated annual mean GPP and terrestrial respiration are 129. 8 and 106. 6 Pg C yr− 1 , slightly larger than observed of 119. 4 ± 5. 9 and 96. 4 ± 6. 0 Pg C yr− 1 . The latitudinal distribution of GPP fluxes simulated by NorESM shows a GPP overestimation of 10 % in the tropics and a substantial underestimation of GPP at high latitudes...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary goal}} of the project {{entitled}} “Incorporation of the HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) into the Community Climate System Model (CCSM) : Evaluation and Climate Applications” was to systematically investigate {{the performance of the}} HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) as an alternative oceanic component of the NCAR’s Community Climate System Model (CCSM). We have configured two versions of the fully coupled CCSM 3 /HYCOM: one with a medium resolution (T 42) Community Atmospheric Model (CAM) and the other with higher resolution (T 85). We have performed a comprehensive analysis of the 400 -year fully coupled CCSM 3 /HYCOM simulations and compared the results with those from CCSM 3 /POP and with <b>climatological</b> <b>observations,</b> and also we have performed tuning of critical model parameters, including Smagorinsky viscosity, isopycnal diffusivity, and background vertical diffusivity. The analysis shows that most oceanic features are well represented in the CCSM 3 /HYCOM. The coupled CCSM 3 /HYCOM (T 42) has been integrated for 400 years, and the results have been archived and transferred to the High Performance Computer in the Florida State Univesity. In the last year, we have made comprehensive diagnostics of the long-term simulations by the comparison with the original CCSM 3 /POP simulation and with the observations. To gain some understanding of the model biases, the mean climate and modes of climate variability of the two models are compared with observations. The examination includes the Northern and Southern Annular Modes (NAM and SAM), the Pacific-North-American (PNA) pattern, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), and the main Southern Ocean SST mode. We also compared the performance of ENSO simulation in the coupled models. This report summarizes the main findings from the comparison of long-term CCSM 3 /HYCOM and CCSM 3 /POP simulations...|$|R
40|$|Rossby {{waves are}} the slow {{atmospheric}} waves that propagate thousands of kilometres {{on the time}} scale of days and are associated with weather. The small amplitude linear theory of Rossby waves on the sphere goes back over two centuries to Laplace’s tidal equations and is today considered thoroughly understood. However, with a more realistic background flow that includes both the tropical trade winds and the midlatitude jetstream, the global wave theory has not been fully established. To study this problem, this thesis uses the rotating shallow water (RSW) equations on the sphere {{as a model for}} Earth’s atmosphere. The spectrum of the RSW equations is numerically computed using a Galerkin method. It is found that the Rossby spectrum of this global model consists of two parts that naturally correspond respectively to local tropical and midlatitude theories. The first part of the spectrum is the countably infinite set of discrete eigenmodes with arbitrarily small wavelength near the equator, consistent with the local tropical β-plane theory. These discrete modes however achieve only a finite limiting wavelength in the midlatitudes. To account for smaller scales in the midlatitudes, it is necessary to consider the continuous spectrum that results from regular singular points in the RSW operator arising from shear in the background flow. The regular singular points correspond to critical latitudes, which prevent wave propagation from the midlatitudes into the tropics. The numerical results are complemented by small wavelength asymptotics of ray theory and Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin (WKB) analysis to gain an understanding of the local wave- length, amplitude and group velocity for Rossby waves. The global understanding of Rossby waves presented in this thesis is used to provide some explanation of the small number of Rossby modes found in long-term <b>climatological</b> <b>observations</b> of theatmosphere...|$|R
