A low carbon steel type (Ck 15) was used as substrate for hard chromium electroplating. Solid carburization was carried out for hard <b>chromium</b> <b>plating</b> specimen at temperature (925 oC) with time duration (2 hr) to be followed with quenching and tempering.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study which focused on the identification and testing of technologies for removing iron and copper from chromium plating solutions. Initially, a literature review was conducted to identify the most viable technologies. Two technologies were then selected for testing: an electrodialytic membrane unit and a porous pot. Tests were conducted on contrived baths with metal concentrations initially in the range of 10 to 15 g/l. The results showed a superior performance by the membrane technology in terms of iron and copper removal. Also, the membrane technology produced a much smaller volume of residual waste. These test results can be used to aid metal finishers in selecting and sizing chrome purification units. Several case studies are examined which document use of purification technologies. BACKGROUND Chromium plating solutions become contaminated with various metallic impurities including trivalent chromium, iron, copper, nickel, aluminum, and zinc. Trivalent chromium contamination results from the plating process when the anode surface area is insufficiently sized in comparison to the cathode area. Other metallic contaminants are introduced by drag-in, cathodic etching, and attack on racks, fixtures and bus bars (figure 1). Various defects in <b>chromium</b> <b>plated</b> deposits are attributed to metallic impurities.

40|$|The {{improvement}} of the thin films production techniques leads to {{the availability of a}} wide range of coatings with high mechanical properties difficult to be reached with monolithic materials. Thin coated surfaces reveal promising results in several applications, especially where high wear resistance is required. However, selecting the best solution for an envisaged application is a difficult task because the tribological performance depends on both coating and substrate properties and also on adhesion between the coating and the substrate. Therefore, among the main challenges of the surface engineering are included suitable procedures to assure enough adhesion between the coating and the substrate and calculation methods to predict the wear and the mechanical behaviour of each coating + substrate arrangement. Ball-cratering micro-scale abrasion technique solve partially this problem once it allows to determine the specific wear rates of coating and substrate by only one set of tests done with the coated surfaces. In this paper, prediction models based on the micro-scale abrasion tests, will be presented and discussed. The derived geometrical models allow the study of ball-on-plane contact and also of crossed-cylinders contact. The ability of these models to be applied on coating development was demonstrated applying the prediction criteria to study the effect of coating thickness and the coating intrinsic specific wear rate. The wear evolution forecasted by the model was also compared to experimental results of hard <b>chromium</b> <b>plated</b> steel and very good correlations were reached. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} to attach {{colloidal}} particles in situ directly onto {{atomic force microscopy}} (AFM) cantilevers was developed and used as colloidal probes. In this method, cantilever surfaces were hydrophobically functionalised and the colloids adhered without glue in an aqueous environment. Experiments measuring the interaction forces between colloidal probes, composed of either wood extractives or a range of model compounds normally present in wood extractives, and glass, cellulose, and chromium surfaces were carried out. Wood extractive colloids exhibited the strongest adhesion to glass control surface (7. 0 mN m- 1), followed in decreasing order by triolein, abietic acid and oleic acid colloids (3. 9 mN m- 1, 2. 2 mN m- 1 and 1. 2 mN m- 1 respectively). Adhesion onto a cellulose surface was strongest for triolein colloids (8. 1 mN m- 1) followed by oleic acid colloids (6. 1 mN m- 1), while adhesion forces for abietic acid and wood extractives colloids were similar (4. 9 mN m- 1 and 4. 3 mN m- 1, respectively). When attached to a chromium surface adhesion forces of abietic acid and wood extractives were strongest and similar (3. 6 mN m- 1 and 3. 9 mN m- 1, respectively); the weakest interaction at this surface was recorded for oleic acid colloids (0. 8 mN m- 1). Similar adhesion forces for wood extractive colloids and abietic acid colloids (onto cellulose and chromium surfaces) reinforces the proposal that abietic acid occupies the outer layer of wood extractive colloids.
