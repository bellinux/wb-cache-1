50|$|Perinatal hypophosphatasia is {{the most}} lethal form. Profound {{hypomineralization}} results in caput membranaceum (a soft <b>calvarium),</b> deformed or shortened limbs during gestation and at birth, and rapid death due to respiratory failure. Stillbirth is not uncommon and long-term survival is rare. Neonates who manage to survive suffer increasing respiratory compromise due to softening of the bones (osteomalacia) and underdeveloped lungs (hypoplastic). Ultimately, this leads to respiratory failure. Epilepsy (seizures) can occur and can prove lethal. Regions of developing, unmineralized bone (osteoid) may expand and encroach on the marrow space, resulting in myelophthisic anemia.|$|E
5000|$|In newborns, X-rays readily {{distinguish}} hypophosphatasia from {{osteogenesis imperfecta}} and congenital dwarfism. Some stillborn skeletons show almost no mineralization; others have marked undermineralization and severe rachitic changes. Occasionally {{there can be}} peculiar complete or partial absence of ossification {{in one or more}} vertebrae. In the skull, individual membranous bones may calcify only at their centers, making it appear that areas of the unossified <b>calvarium</b> have cranial sutures that are widely separated when, in fact, they are functionally closed. Small protrusions (or [...] "tongues") of radiolucency often extend from the metaphyses into the bone shaft.|$|E
50|$|Patients may {{experience}} delayed walking, a characteristic waddling gait, stiffness and pain, and muscle weakness (especially in the thighs) consistent with nonprogressive myopathy. Typically, radiographs show defects in calcification and characteristic bony defects near {{the ends of}} major long bones. Growth retardation, frequent fractures, and low bone density (osteopenia) are common. In severely-affected infants and young children, cranial bones can fuse prematurely, despite the appearance of open fontanels on radiographic studies. The illusion of open fontanels results from hypomineralization of {{large areas of the}} <b>calvarium.</b> Premature bony fusion of the cranial sutures may elevate intracranial pressure.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} main signs of acalvaria: {{absence of the}} flat bones of the cranial vault, absence of the dura mater and muscles {{associated}} with it, skull abnormalities, {{and the absence of}} a skull cap. This condition can be diagnosed prior to birth using ultrasonography. Physicians often use magnetic resonance imaging to confirm the diagnosis because in utero, acalvaria is sometimes confused with anencephaly or encephalocele. A distinguishable difference is that with anencephaly, the cerebral hemispheres are missing, but with acalvaria, all parts of the cerebrum are usually present and developed, whereas parts of the <b>calvarium</b> are missing.|$|E
50|$|The skull (thöpa) damaru is {{made from}} a male and female skull bone or <b>calvarium,</b> cut well above {{the area of the}} ear, and joined at their apex. Inside, male and female mantras are {{appropriately}} inscribed in gold. The skins are traditionally cured by burying them with copper and other mineral salts, and special herbal formulas for about two weeks. These are then stretched and applied to the two sides, giving the skins their familiar blue or green mottled appearance. A collar of simple brocade, or copper or silver, has a hand-hold, and is the site of attachment of the beaters, whose knit cover represents two eyeballs. The skulls are also carefully chosen for their attributes and source. After the Tibetan diaspora in 1960, they began to be manufactured in India and Nepal, with a continued degradation of quality. Today, India is no longer a source, and their creation and export from Nepal are banned, because of the acquiring of human bone through illegal practices. One still does find occasionally those with painted skins and without the proper mantras or other characteristics.|$|E
5000|$|Biophysicists have implicated {{acoustic}} impedance, or {{the ratio}} of acoustic pressure to particle velocity, as a factor contributing to blast damage in vivo. Wave transitions between tissues with significantly different acoustic impedances, particularly between the external environment and bone, causes focal mechanical damage {{as a result of}} wave energy dissipation. Current research has implicated the importance of a histological component in blast trauma; patients exposed to blast waves often present with elongation and/or splitting of cells due to the shear stress of a shockwave. This cellular damage often follows the direction of wave propagation. Patient distance from the epicenter, materials employed in the bomb design, and confinement of the bomb all determine the degree of trauma incurred by patients exposed to bombings. Additionally, skull size and geometry, the degree of tissue penetration by the wave, and a possible “lens effect” due to wave reflection upon incidence with the concave <b>calvarium</b> and/or dissipation in the gas-filled sinuses may further complicate wave transmission. Additionally, researchers have implicated both the auditory canals and the orbitals as potential routes for wave propagation into the central nervous system ...|$|E
50|$|Major {{findings}} regarding the two missile wounds: Skull: There are multiple fractures {{of the bones}} of the <b>calvarium</b> bilaterally. These fractures extend into the base of the skull and involve the floor of the anterior fossa on the right side as well as the middle fossa in the midline. With respect to the right frontoparietal region of the skull, the traumatic damage is particularly severe with extensive fragmentation of the bony structures from the midline of the frontal bone anteriorly to the vicinity of the posterior margin of the parietal bone behind. Above, the fragmentation extends approximately 25 mm across the midline to involve adjacent portions of the left parietal bone; below, the changes extend into the right temporal bone. Throughout this region, many of the bony pieces have been displaced outward; several pieces are missing. Distributed through the right cerebral hemisphere are numerous small, irregular metallic fragments most of which are less than 1 mm in maximum dimension.The majority of these fragments lie anteriorly and superiorly. None can be visualized {{on the left side of}} the brain and none below a horizontal plane through the floor of the anterior fossa of the skull. On one of the lateral films of the skull (#2), a hole measuring approximately 8 mm in diameter on the outer surface of the skull and as much as 20 mm on the internal surface can be seen in profile approximately 100 mm above the external occipital protuberance. The bone of the lower edge of the hole is depressed. Also, there is, embedded in the outer table of the skull close to the lower edge of the hole, a large metallic fragment which on the anteroposterior film (#1) lies 25 mm to the right of the midline. This fragment as seen in the latter film is round and measures 6.5 mm in diameter immediately adjacent to the hole on the internal surface of the skull, there is localized elevation of the soft tissues. Small fragments of bone lie within portions of these tissues and within the hole itself. These changes are consistent with an entrance wound of the skull produced by a bullet similar to that of exhibit CE 399. The metallic fragments visualized within the right cerebral hemisphere fall into two groups. One group consists of relatively large fragments, more or less randomly distributed. The second group consists of finely divided fragments, distributed in a posteroanterior direction in a region 45 mm long and 8& mm wide.As seen on lateral film #2, this formation overlies the position of the coronal suture; its long axis, if extended posteriorly, passes through the above-mentioned hole. It appears to end anteriorly immediately below the badly fragmented frontal and parietal bones just anterior to the region of the coronal suture. The foregoing observations indicate that the decedent's head was struck from behind by a single projectile. It entered the occipital region 25 mm to the right of the midline and 100 mm above the external occipital protuberance. The projectile fragmented on entering the skull, one major section leaving a trail of fine metallic debris as it passed forward and laterally to explosively fracture the right frontal and parietal bones as it emerged from the head. In addition to the foregoing, it is noteworthy that there is no evidence of projectile fragments in the left cerebral tissues or in the right cerebral hemisphere below a horizontal plane passing through the floor of the anterior fossa of the skull.Also, although the fractures of the <b>calvarium</b> extend to the left of the midline and into the anterior and middle fossa of the skull, no bony defect, such as one created by a projectile either entering or leaving the head, is seen in the <b>calvarium</b> to the left of the midline or in the base of the skull. Hence, it is not reasonable to postulate that a projectile passed through the head in a direction other than that described above. Of further note, when the X-ray films of the skull were presented to The Panel, film #1 had been damaged in two small regions by what appears to be the heat from a spotlight. Also, on film #2, a pair of converging pencil lines had been drawn on the film. Neither of these artifacts interfered with the interpretation of the films.|$|E
50|$|Craniopagus {{twins are}} {{conjoined}} twins that are fused at the cranium. This condition occurs in about 10-20 babies in every million births in the United States. Among this small group, cephalic conjoining, or craniopagus twinning, represents the rarest of congenital abnormalities, accounting for 2-6% of all conjoined twins. Additionally, conjoined twins are genetically identical and always {{share the same}} sex. The union in craniopagus twins may occur on any portion of the <b>calvarium,</b> but does not include either the face or the foramen magnum. The thorax and abdomen are separate and each twin has its own umbilicus and umbilical cord. The union may involve the entire diameter of the head or only a small portion. This suggests that {{although there are many}} different kinds of variabilities already known in the scientific community, there are an infinite number of variations that can occur. Most of these variations are based on the rotation of one twin's skull to the other and the different phenotypic sub-groups of craniopagus twins are based on all these rotational conformations. Each of these factors (rotation, spot of union) affects the development of the brain, the vascular system within the brain and overall wellness of life both of the twins have outside the womb. Relatively few craniopagus twins survive the perinatal period - approximately 40% of conjoined twins are stillborn and an additional 33% die within the immediate perinatal period, usually from organ abnormalities and failure. However 25% of craniopagus twins survive and can be considered for a surgical separation and several attempts occur yearly worldwide. In the last-half century, many advances in medicine including brain imaging, neuro-anaesthesia and neurosurgical techniques have proven that a successful outcome is possible following separation of total craniopagus twins.|$|E
5000|$|The {{exact nature}} of how {{conjoined}} twins develop inutero remains unclear. Embryologists have traditionally attributed identical twinning as [...] "splitting or fission" [...] of either the inner cell mass of pleuripotential cells or early embryonic disc at 13-14 days of gestation just before the primitive streak. Some theorists suggested that conjoined twins develop {{as a result of}} the failed fusion of a single fertilized ovum. However a new hypothesis suggests that cranial fusion occurs between two separate embryos prior to the end of the 4th week of gestation. This is able to happen because the cranial neuropore is still open which is responsible for the ultimate fusion and formation of the brain stem and central nervous system. Furthermore, this secondary fusion of embryonic discs could implicate that intact skin will not fuse to other intact skin, including the ectoderm of the embryo. This means that two embryonic discs could only unite in locations where the ectoderm is absent. Moreover, the fusion occurs from neural folds of two separate, dorsally oriented embryonic discs, and the union can occur only after the ectoderm is disrupted to allow the neural and surface ectodermal layers to separate from each other. The union in craniopagus twins may happen at any portion of the <b>calvarium.</b> The juncture can involve either the entire diameter of the head or any portion of the head and can be positioned at a multitude of rotational angles. In fact, craniopagus twins are rarely found in a symmetrical union. Apart from this, the vertebral axes may have a straight line. Despite this, the angle of the vertebrae is the ultimate dictator in how the individuals heads actually face. The majority of twins face either the same way or the exact opposite direction.Many reviews suggest a practical four-category system that breaks down the craniopagus twins on the basis of vertical or angular configuration or on the basis if there were shared dural venous sinuses. This scheme was applied to 64 cases and has adequately described sets of twins for over the last 86 years.|$|E

40|$|Ó The Author(s) 2010. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Literature addressing the anatomic {{development of the}} dura and <b>calvarium</b> during childhood is limited. Nevertheless, histological features of a subdural neomembrane (NM), including its thickness and vascularity, developing {{in response to an}} acute subdural hematoma (SDH) have been compared to the dura of adults to estimate when an injury occurred. Therefore, we measured the morphometric growth of the <b>calvarium</b> and dura and the vascular density within the dura during infancy. The mean thicknesses of the <b>calvarium</b> and dura as a function of occipitofrontal circumference (OFC), as well as the mean number of vessels per 259 field, were determined from the right parasagittal midparietal bone lateral to the sagittal suture of 128 infants without a history of head trauma. Our results showed that as OFC increased, the mean thicknesses of the <b>calvarium</b> and dura increased while the vascular density within the dura decreased.
