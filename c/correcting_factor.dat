Setting: Department of Ophthalmology, Second University of Naples, Naples, Italy. Methods: Nineteen eyes from the literature that underwent cataract extraction and IOL implantation after refractive surgery were used to compare actual postoperative and expected refractive errors utilizing the R factor, CHM, and DKM. Intraocular lens powers were calculated with 3 formulas: SRK/T, Hoffer Q and Holladay 1. The differences were evaluated with the Wilcoxon test and Spearman correlation.

Use of the effective dose concept for medical irradiation risk definition involves a number of essential restrictions.

Lifelong risk of stochastic effects occurrence in children is 2 - 3 {{times higher than the}} rating values used in effective dose concept, while for elderly people (about 60 years at irradiation time) it’s 4 - 5 times lower.  The article suggests the algorithm of effective doses values <b>correcting</b> <b>factors</b> assessment for consideration of dependence of radiogenic cancer risk factors on age and sex. This enables to assess more correctly collective risk of radiology and nuclear medicine imaging.

Thus, in most cases, the effective dose concept leads to conservative assessment of medical irradiation collective risk. </p...|$|R
