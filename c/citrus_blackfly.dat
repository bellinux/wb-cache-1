Encarsia perplexa is another <b>citrus</b> <b>blackfly</b> parasitoid that has been used alongside Amitus hesperidum to control the pest in both states. E. perplexa multiplies more slowly but is better at scouting for outlying blackflies and is more effective when populations of potential hosts are lower.|$|E
50|$|This wasp is {{a native}} of India and Vietnam. It has been {{introduced}} to and has established itself in Barbados, Cuba, Jamaica, Mexico, Salvador, Venezuela, the USA (Florida, Texas and Hawaii), Kenya and Oman, for the purpose of controlling <b>citrus</b> <b>blackfly.</b>|$|E

50|$|The <b>citrus</b> <b>blackfly</b> has {{a number}} of natural enemies. The most {{effective}} agents for controlling it in Florida are the parasitic wasps, Encarsia perplexa and Amitus hesperidum. The former has a lower rate of reproduction than does A. hesperidum, but is better able to search out suitable hosts. The latter is well synchronized with its host, as adult female wasps are ready to lay their eggs {{at about the same time}} as suitable larval stages of the blackfly are present. These species have been used in biological control of the pest. For example, both species were introduced into Hawaii in 1999 after discovery of the presence of the <b>citrus</b> <b>blackfly</b> the previous year. Both wasps have succeeded in establishing themselves and are helping to reduce the damage done by the pest.|$|E
50|$|In Hawaii, both {{species were}} {{introduced}} in 1999 after the <b>citrus</b> <b>blackfly</b> was discovered there {{for the first time}} the previous year.

50|$|The <b>citrus</b> <b>blackfly</b> {{is found}} on over 300 host plant species, but citrus trees such as lemon, orange and pomelo are most heavily infested. Noncitrus trees and shrubs, {{when they grow}} by themselves, are not {{normally}} attacked by this insect, {{but they may be}} when they grow close to heavy infestations on citrus. In Hawaii, such trees as mango, avocado, pink tecoma, and surinam cherry have hosted colonies.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} {{harm done}} by the <b>citrus</b> <b>blackfly</b> is the sucking of the tree's sap, which deprives it of both water and nutrients. The excretion of honeydew coats the leaf surfaces and encourages the growth of sooty mold. This can severely impair both leaf respiration and photosynthesis. The combination of all these factors causes {{a decline in the}} health and vigour of the tree and a reduction in fruit yield.|$|E

50|$|After mating, {{a female}} lays diploid eggs in nymphs of the <b>citrus</b> <b>blackfly.</b> When available, a second instar nymph is {{selected}} and each egg will eventually produce a female adult. At 24 °C in the laboratory, it takes 30 to 35 days from egg-laying to adult emergence. Unmated females lay haploid {{eggs in the}} fully developed larvae of their own species. These hatch out into males, {{a process known as}} adelpho-parasitism. The sex ratio among adults in the field is one male to every seven females. Encarsia perplexa is itself parasitized by Encarsia smithi which was accidentally introduced into Florida in the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|The only hosts {{that have}} been {{identified}} for Encarsia perplexa are Aleurocanthus woglumi and Aleurocanthus incertus, another whitefly.

His research areas included control methods or the cotton boll weevil, Argentine ant, and American foul brood in honeybees. During his long career, he published technical papers on cotton and scale insects, apiculture, quarantine programs and procedures, and insect eradication. Dr. Newell had a particular interest in ant taxonomy, but also conducted pioneering research on boll weevil control in Louisiana and maintained a deep interest in apiary work in Texas and other states. However, he was best known for his activities in control and eradication of plant pests.

5000|$|Several {{offspring}} {{may develop}} inside a single host but this species is not polyembryonic. The eggs are laid {{in any of}} the larval stages of the <b>citrus</b> <b>blackfly</b> but the first instar is preferred. A female larval host results in the production of two or three adult wasps but parasitism of a male pupa produces only one. Parasitism of a female pupa may result in either a male or a female adult wasp. The time taken for an egg to develop into an adult varies from 45 to 60 days under laboratory conditions at a temperature of 27 °C. The wasps live for three to five days in the field during which time the female can produce up to sixty eggs. This wasp is well synchronized with its host [...] and is capable of controlling dense populations of the pest. However it is not good at searching out scattered individuals and its numbers decrease sharply as its host population is controlled. Other hosts which are also parasitised include Aleurocanthus citriperdus and Aleurocanthus spiniferus.|$|E

40|$|O Brasil ? o maior produtor mundial de laranja. A partir da d?cada de 1980 consolidouse tamb?m como o maior produtor mundial de suco dessa fruta. A citricultura ? afetada por in?meros problemas fitossanit?rios, representados pelas pragas e doen?as, estando entre os cultivos com mais perdas em vista do ataque de insetos, ?caros e pat?genos. Atualmente, a mosca-negra-dos-citros ? uma das principais pragas dessa cultura e pode levar ? redu??o da frutifica??o em at? 80 % e perdas de 20 a 80 % na produ??o.

Para isso, buscou selecionar as plantas inseticidas mais promissoras ({{screening}}); selecionar o melhor extrator dentro de cada planta promissora; realizar bioensaios de a??o translaminar, sist?mica e t?pica e realizar a an?lise qu?mica dos extratos promissores. Os extratos ou fra??es foram aplicados com aux?lio de um aer?grafo de precis?o sobre ninfas de segundo est?dio ou ovos de A. woglumi. Ap?s sete ou oito dias da aplica??o do extrato, foram avaliadas as mortalidades ninfais e inviabilidade dos ovos, respectivamente. Inicialmente, foi determinada a CL 50 com o uso de extratos aquosos de am?ndoas de Azadirachta indica, em seguida foi realizado um screening com quatorze esp?cies de plantas com potencial inseticida, incluindo diferentes estruturas. Foram selecionadas as tr?s esp?cies de plantas inseticidas mais promissoras. Dessas esp?cies foram selecionados os melhores extratores (hexano, diclorometano e metanol) e fra??es (extra??o com metanol do extrato hexano, extra??o l?quido-l?quido e fracionamento cromatogr?fico); al?m de bioensaios referentes aos modos de a??o (traslaminar, sist?mico e t?pico) e pr?-testes de atividade ovicida e ninficida. Foram realizadas an?lises qu?micas dos extratos em Cromatografia Gasosa de Alta Resolu??o Acoplada a Espectr?metro de Massa (CGAR-EM) e Cromatografia L?quida de Alta Efici?ncia Acoplada a Detector de Arranjo de Diodos CLAE/DAD. Os dados dos bioensaios foram submetidos ? ANOVA ou seu equivalente n?o-param?trico Kruskal-Wallis. As diferen?as foram consideradas significativas ao n?vel de probabilidade p < 0, 05. Entre os extratos aquosos testados, o mais promissor no controle da mosca-negra-dos-citros foi o obtido a partir das ra?zes do ec?tipo C do timb? Derris floribunda seguindo-se os extratos de am?ndoas de A. indica e de folhas de Melia azedarach. Na compara??o entre os solventes hexano, diclorometano e metanol, de diferentes polaridades, a maior bioatividade para as tr?s esp?cies de plantas citadas ? obtida com o uso do solvente mais apolar (hexano). Entre os timb?s, em especial, o ec?tipo C (D. floribunda) apresenta elevada toxicidade sobre a mosca-negra tanto com o uso de extratos aquosos quanto com o extrato obtido por meio de extra??es sucessivas com solventes em ordem crescente de polaridade, e principalmente na parti??o hexano sol?vel. As an?lises em CLAE-DAD indicam que, isoladamente, as subst?ncias da classe dos rotenoides nos extratos dos timb?s, n?o provocam elevada mortalidade de A. woglumi, sugerindo que o efeito t?xico pode estar relacionado ? presen?a de outros metab?litos secund?rios, al?m do sinergismo entre eles. As an?lises por CGAR-EM registram a presen?a de ?cidos graxos, que s?o importantes no mecanismo da bioatividade, por?m, o mecanismo de a??o sobre a mosca-negra n?o est? elucidado. Os extratos em metanol de am?ndoas de A. indica, de ra?zes do ec?tipo C do timb?

As of the 1980 s Brazil also became the top orange juice producer. Citrus growing faces a series of agricultural problems, especially {{in the form of}} pests and diseases, placing citrus among the crops with the highest losses due to insects, mites and pathogens. Currently, the <b>citrus</b> <b>blackfly</b> (Aleurocanthus woglumi) {{is one of the main}} pests, causing a reduction of fruit production as high as 80 % and fruit losses of 20 - 80 %. This study evaluates the effectiveness of insecticidal plant extracts (aqueous and organic), both native and exotic, in the control of Aleurocanthus woglumi, in laboratory conditions (29, 10 ? 0, 15 ?C; 68, 44 ? 0, 75 % RH). We screened for the most promissing plants, selected the best extractor from those plants, conducted bioassays of translaminar, systemic, and topical action, and conducted chemical analyses of the most promissing extracts. The extracts or fractions were applied using an aer?grafo specific to second stage nymphs or eggs of A. woglumi. After seven or eight days of extract applications, we examined nymph mortality and egg viability. Initially, we determined CL 50 with the use of aqueous almond (Azadirachta indica) extracts; subsequently we screened 14 plant species containing possible insecticides with different structures. We selected the three most promissing plant species and from these the best extractors (hexane, dichloromethane and methanol) and fractions (methanol extraction of hexane extract, liquid-liquid extraction and chromatographic fractioning); also bioassays based on mode of action (translaminar, systemic, or topical) and pretests of ovicidal and nymphicidal activity. Extracts were analyzed with joint gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Bioassay results were analyzed with ANOVA or its non-parametric equivalent, Kruskal-Wallis. Differences were considered significant at p < 0. 05. Among the aqueous extracts tested, the most promissing in the control of the <b>citrus</b> <b>blackfly</b> came from roots of ecotype C of the plant timb? (Derris floribunda), followed by almond A. indica extract and leaf extracts from Melia azedarach. In comparisons among solvents of different polarities, greatest bioactivity for the three plant species cited was obtained using the most apolar solvent (hexane). Among timb?s (D. floribunda), ecotype C presented elevated toxicity to the blackfly, as much with aqueous extraction as with extraction solvents with successively increasing polarity, especially in the hexane-soluble partition. HPLC indicated that in isolation the rotenoids in timb? extracts do not cause high mortality in A. woglumi, suggesting that the toxic effect may be related to the presence of other secondary metabolites or the synergy among them. GC-MS analyses detected the presence of fatty acids, which are important in bioactivity, but whose mechanism with respect to the blackfly is not clear. Methanol-based extracts of nuts of A. indica, those of roots of D. floribunda and of leaves of M. azedarach, although lacking both translaminar and systemic action, present topical action on A. woglumi...|$|E
