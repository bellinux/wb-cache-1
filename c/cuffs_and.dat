5|$|As {{the team}} {{changed its name}} from the Winia to the Halla the uniforms had minor changes made to them. The logo changed names and the uniforms had colored {{shoulders}} removed from them. The current home jerseys feature a solid blue background with yellow stripes on the <b>cuffs</b> <b>and</b> bottom of the body {{as well as a number}} of blue rough shapes behind the gold trim as well as sponsor logos on the shoulders. The away jerseys feature a solid white background with dark blue striped borders on the <b>cuffs</b> <b>and</b> bottom of the body, it also contains the same rough blue shapes behind the trim. The Halla put the first name of Korean players on the jerseys to avoid confusion as several players share the same family name.|$|E
5|$|All {{the regular}} first-choice players signed on {{again for the}} new campaign, apart from goalkeeper George Hollis. Of the less regular team members, Bernard Pumfrey left for Midland League club Gainsborough Trinity, William Reynolds and Gilbert Smith were {{released}} to join Birmingham & District League club Berwick Rangers, and Chris Charsley retired from League football to concentrate on his police career. Small Heath signed the former Sunderland full back Jack Oliver, whom they had failed to recruit earlier in the season, and forward Charlie Letherbarrow from Walsall, but those were the only major signings. The squad was boosted by players from local football, who included Alec Leake, Bill Lewis and a young Billy Pratt. Alfred Jones continued as secretary-manager, and Caesar Jenkyns retained the captaincy. There were no changes to the team's kit of light blue shirts with navy collar trim, <b>cuffs</b> <b>and</b> pocket, white knickerbockers and navy socks.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the regular}} first-team {{members from the}} {{previous}} season, goalkeeper Chris Charsley, a serving police officer, was unavailable and full back Tom Bayley had been released. Fred Speller, who had suffered a badly broken leg early in the season, had been playing in practice matches and {{was believed to be}} back to full fitness. Fringe players Harry Edwards and Fred Jones had left the club, and Harry Morris had retired to concentrate on his plumbing business. Goalkeeper George Hollis, backs Arthur Littleford, Bernard Pumfrey and George Short, half-backs Ted Devey, Caesar Jenkyns, Teddy Jolley and Billy Ollis, and forwards Jack Hallam, Tommy Hands, Frank Mobley, Billy Walton and Fred Wheldon all remained with the club. Newcomers included forwards Jack Lee, Charles Izon and Walter Jackson, all signed from non-league clubs in the West Midlands area. Alfred Jones continued as secretary-manager, and Caesar Jenkyns retained the captaincy. The team adopted a new kit, keeping the white knickerbockers but replacing the royal blue shirt and stockings with shirts in a lighter shade of blue, with navy collar trim, <b>cuffs</b> <b>and</b> pocket and navy stockings.|$|E

5|$|Generally, {{the uniform}} jacket of the Confederate soldier was single breasted, made of gray or brown fabric, with a {{six to nine}} button front. The design of the garment {{featured}} several variations: a four to six piece body, {{and one or two}} piece sleeves, usually with lining, often of a cotton material. The fabric used in these jackets, ranged from the finer kerseys and broadcloths used early in the war, to the cotton/wool blends of jeans, satinette, and cassimere, to name several examples. The exact color of the fabric also ranged from the prewar bright cadet gray, similar to the fabric used by Virginia Military Institute, or West Point U.S. Military Academy dress uniforms, to the sumac and logwood dyed fabrics, that would eventually fade to the ragged butternut appearance. Epaulettes may have been used {{in the construction of the}} jacket, as was the case for the Richmond clothing bureau designed jackets, commonly called today, the Richmond Depot types I, II, and III. Belt loops were also in intermittent use, such as the Richmond and the Charleston clothing depots. Trimming on the jackets range from piped or taped collars, <b>cuffs,</b> <b>and</b> front lapel edges, to full facings on the collar and cuffs, commonly in light blue, dark blue, red, or black. Due to the difficulty in obtaining yellow dye ingredients as the war progressed, yellow was infrequently used by the Cavalry Corps throughout the conflict.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: Several {{different}} {{imaging techniques}} {{are available for}} evaluating the rotator <b>cuff</b> <b>and</b> biceps tendon. The common disorders of impingement, rotator <b>cuff</b> tears <b>and</b> biceps tendonitis are discussed along with the role which the various imaging modalities can play in establishing their diagnosis. Plain radiographs can be helpful particularly {{with a history of}} trauma but give limited information on the soft tissues. Ultrasound is a useful and inexpensive means of assessing the rotator <b>cuff</b> <b>and</b> biceps tendon but has a number of limitations and varying reports on its accuracy. Computed tomography (CT) is most helpful in the evaluation of shoulder trauma but gives limited information on the soft tissues. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an accurate imaging modality for evaluating the rotator <b>cuff</b> <b>and</b> biceps tendon, allowing visualisation of the soft tissues and the adjacent bony structures...|$|R
