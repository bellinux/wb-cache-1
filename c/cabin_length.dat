50|$|Since 1934, the 52 chassises of the Tatra T72 version were {{extensively}} {{modified to}} produce an armored car OA vz. 30. Other specialized versions have included telephone cable layers (52 built in 1933-1935), and machine gun carriers (23 delivered in August 1934).

Another common(80 produced) model were command-maintenance cars build with two different <b>cabin</b> <b>lengths,</b> capable of carrying 5 passengers plus mixed cargo-passenger space at the rear. These cars were routinely issued to the commanders of the artillery regiments of the Czech army. Finally, 14 chassises were built as tourers with passenger space only.|$|R

60|$|Hastings {{decided to}} eat dinner--he called the midday meal by its old-fashioned name--before sailing; and down below Saxon was {{surprised}} and delighted by the measure of comfort in so tiny a cabin. There was just room for Billy to stand upright. A centerboard-case divided the room in half longitudinally, and to this was attached the hinged table from which they ate. Low bunks that ran the full <b>cabin</b> <b>length,</b> upholstered in cheerful green, served as seats. A curtain, easily attached by hooks between the centerboard-case and the roof, at night screened Mrs. Hastings' sleeping quarters. On the opposite side the two Japanese bunked, while for'ard, under the deck, was the galley. So small was it that there was just room beside it for the cook, who was compelled by the low deck to squat on his hands. The other Japanese, who had brought the parcels on board, waited on the table.|$|E

The total number of simulations was 14, 400, including four smoke exhaust rates. The time to flashover was computed for two different times of operation of the smoke extraction system.

It drew 1 ft 7 in (480 mm) empty, and flew a Bermuda rig consisting of a 32 square feet (3 m²) high aspect main sail and a 48 square feet (4.5 m²) jib (technically a genoa since it overlapped the main). Length at waterline was 11 ft 10 in (3.6 m), giving a hull speed of just under 4.5 knots (8 km/h). The shallow V hull was not designed to plane, but is generally considered very capable at cutting through choppy water.|$|R

60|$|Within, {{there is}} one long narrow <b>cabin,</b> the whole <b>length</b> of the boat; from which the state-rooms open, on both sides.

The washing apparatus is forward, on the deck. It is a little better than on board the canal boat, but not much. In all modes of travelling, the American customs, with reference to the means of personal cleanliness and wholesome ablution, are extremely negligent and filthy; and I strongly incline to the belief that a considerable amount of illness is referable to this cause.|$|R
40|$|Although {{the cabin}} design {{is widely used}} for {{providing}} fire safety in big public transport terminals in the Far East, there are concerns on this design concept. Very few full-scale burning tests on the design were reported in the literature. Smoke exhaust system might be put at high or low level. In this article, full-scale burning tests were carried out to study smoke control with mechanical exhaust at high level in a cabin fire. A <b>cabin</b> of <b>length</b> 3 m, width 4 m, and height 3 m was constructed. Smoke temperature, smoke layer height in the cabin, and velocity in the fan duct were measured with different heat release rates and heights of the ventilation opening. Twelve sets of tests were carried out with results reported in this article. Experimental results indicated that when {{the height of the}} ventilation opening was high, the calculation results of McCaffrey plume correlation were lower than the experimental data. When the height of the ventilation opening was low, the calculation results of McCaffrey plume correlation were higher than the experimental data. The calculation results of McCaffrey plume correlation agreed well with the experimental data in the intermittent flame zone. McCaffrey plume correlation used in cabin design should be revised with the coefficient concerned. Further, empirical correlation on the flow rate of fans in controlling smoke not to spill out from the cabin was derived based on the experimental data.

40|$|Although {{the cabin}} design {{is widely used}} for {{providing}} fire safety in big and tall public transport terminals in the Far East, there are many debates on its performance. Very few experimental studies with big fires in a cabin were reported in the literature. In many applications, smoke exhaust was at low level in the cabin. The performance of such systems has to be justified. Full-scale burning tests were carried out to study smoke exhaust at low levels in a cabin fire. A <b>cabin</b> of <b>length</b> 3 m, width 4 m and height 3 m was constructed. Smoke temperature, average smoke layer height in the cabin, and velocity in the fan duct were measured with different heat release rates and heights of the ventilation opening. Eight sets of tests were carried out with results reported in this paper. For smoke exhaust at low level, the interface of smoke layer was low, usually lower than {{the height of the}} ventilation opening. The fire plume was then at the continuous flame zone. The interface of the smoke layer would be tilted. The smoke layer near the mechanical exhaust ventilation was lower than that at the opposite wall. The calculated smoke production rate would then be lower than the mechanical exhaust rate, as air would be extracted directly from the lower layer. In designing mechanical exhaust system in a cabin, the plume coefficient should be tuned up by a factor. In this paper, the mechanical exhaust rate used in cabin design at low levels would be estimated by changing the coefficient concerned. Plume correlation expression due to McCaffrey was taken as an example. Semi-empirical correlation of the flow rates of the fan in controlling smoke not to spill out was derived based on the experimental data...|$|R
