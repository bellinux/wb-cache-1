50|$|<b>Chlormephos</b> (chemical formula: C5H12ClO2PS2) is an organothiophosphate insecticide. It is {{classified}} as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.|$|E
40|$|A new {{insect pest}} - the {{western corn rootworm}} (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte) was {{identified}} in Croatia in 1995. The first objective {{of this research was}} to determine the population density of all stages, except eggs in commercial cor fields. The second objective was to investigate the efficacy of three organophosphate insecticides on larvae. The experiment was conducted in Gunja, Croatia in 1999 and 2000. Treatments were commercial corn hybrids (OSSK 444, OSSK 552, Florencia,) and three soil insecticides (terbuphos, chlorpyriphos-ethyl, <b>chlormephos)</b> applied at planting. Results showed the highest number of larvae per plant (0. 70) in the untreated plot of OSSK 552. In 1999, significant differences in larval numbers occurred among hybrids, but not among the insecticides. In 2000, larval numbers only differed statistically between the insecticide treatments. The highest beetles population counted per plant was 0. 55 in 2000. This population level is very close to economic threshold of 0. 70 beetles per plant. Significant differences in beetle numbers per plant between hybrids were only detected in 2000. Pheromone traps containing the lure, Csal♀m♂N, caught significantly more beetles than the Multigard yellow sticky-trap. Terbufos was the only soil insecticide providing a significant yield advantage to the hybrids. Based on the current value of corn and cost of insecticide, terbufos is the only soil insecticide cost-effective for growers. These studies should be conducted with other insecticides, and growers should avoid planting corn after corn in their fields...|$|E
