25|$|Fairtrade {{labelling}} (usually simply Fairtrade or Fair Trade Certified in the United States) is a {{certification system}} designed to allow consumers to identify goods which meet agreed standards. Overseen by a standard-setting body (FLO International) and a <b>certification</b> <b>body</b> (FLO-CERT), the system involves independent auditing of producers and traders to ensure the agreed standards are met. For a product to carry either the International Fairtrade Certification Mark or the Fair Trade Certified Mark, it must come from FLO-CERT inspected and certified producer organizations. The crops must be grown and harvested {{in accordance with the}} international Fair trade standards set by FLO International. The supply chain must also have been monitored by FLO-CERT, to ensure the integrity of the labelled product.|$|E
25|$|One of Taiwan's halal <b>certification</b> <b>body</b> is the Taiwan Halal Integrity Development Association, inaugurated in May 2011 in Taipei, {{obtained}} the membership to a cross-border halal food certification program which {{is governed by}} the authorities from Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. The association is based in Taipei Cultural Mosque. Another type of Halal certification, the 'Muslim Friendly Restaurant' certification, is handled by the Chinese Muslim Association. The purpose of the certification, except to certify the Halal-ness of the food, is to let the world knows that there are Muslims in Taiwan too. The certification guidelines specify method, source, items, dos and donts in hosting Muslim customers according to their customs in dining in restaurants. The methods specified by the certification guidelines may make the cost of hosting Muslim travelers more costly, but it helps to attract more Muslim tourist visitors to Taiwan.|$|E
25|$|The FLO International (Fairtrade International), {{created in}} 1997, is an {{association}} of three producer networks and twenty national labeling initiatives that develop Fairtrade standards, license buyers, label usage and market the Fair trade Certification Mark in consuming countries. The Fairtrade International labeling system is {{the largest and most}} widely recognized standard setting and <b>certification</b> <b>body</b> for labeled Fair trade. Formerly named Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International, it changed its name to Fairtrade International in 2009, when its producer certification and standard setting activities were separated into two separate, but connected entities. FLO-CERT, the for-profit side, handles producer certification, inspecting and certifying producer organizations in more than 50 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Fairtrade International, the non-profit arm, oversees standards development and licensing organization activity. Only products from certain developing countries are eligible for certification, and for some products such as coffee and cocoa, certification is restricted to cooperatives. Cooperatives and large estates with hired labor may be certified for bananas, tea and other crops.|$|E

5000|$|International Organization for Standardization (ISO) {{does not}} certify {{organizations}} itself. Numerous <b>certification</b> <b>bodies</b> exist, which audit organizations and, upon success, issue ISO 9001 compliance certificates. Although {{commonly referred to}} as [...] "ISO 9000" [...] certification, the actual standard to which an organization's quality management system can be certified is ISO 9001:2015 (ISO 9001:2008 will expire by around September 2018). Many countries have formed accreditation bodies to authorize ("accredit") the <b>certification</b> <b>bodies.</b> Both the accreditation <b>bodies</b> and the <b>certification</b> <b>bodies</b> charge fees for their services. The various accreditation bodies have mutual agreements with each other to ensure that certificates issued by one of the accredited <b>certification</b> <b>bodies</b> (CB) are accepted worldwide. <b>Certification</b> <b>bodies</b> themselves operate under another quality standard, ISO/IEC 17021, while accreditation bodies operate under ISO/IEC 17011.|$|R

2500|$|By {{the late}} 1970s American and European governments and {{business}} leaders had become increasingly concerned about competition from Japan. [...] Many decided to adopt some Japanese industrial practices, including quality management, which was thought to have played a large part in the Japanese economic miracle. Beginning in the early 1980s, the quality standard BS 5750 (1979) became widely adopted by British companies. Yarsley Technical Centre already had a strong background in standards and accreditation and, in 1985, Fulmer established Yarsley Quality Assured Firms (YQAF) as an independent <b>certification</b> <b>body,</b> supported by the UK Department of Trade and Industry, which assessed conformity to BS 5750 and certified conforming companies. YQAF's certification service was overseen by an independent Certification Board under an independent chairman, thus ensuring {{that there was no}} conflict of interest with YQAF's consultancy services.|$|E
