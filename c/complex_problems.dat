5|$|Ant {{societies}} have division of labour, communication between individuals, {{and an ability}} to solve <b>complex</b> <b>problems.</b> These parallels with human {{societies have}} long been an inspiration and subject of study. Many human cultures make use of ants in cuisine, medication, and rituals. Some species are valued in their role as biological pest control agents. Their ability to exploit resources may bring ants into conflict with humans, however, as they can damage crops and invade buildings. Some species, such as the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta), are regarded as invasive species, establishing themselves in areas where they have been introduced accidentally.|$|E
5|$|Society and {{government}} in England {{in the early}} 14th century were challenged by the Great Famine and the Black Death. The economic and demographic crisis created a sudden surplus of land, undermining the ability of landowners to exert their feudal rights and causing a collapse in incomes from rented lands. Wages soared, as employers competed for a scarce workforce. Legislation was introduced to limit wages and to prevent the consumption of luxury goods by the lower classes, with prosecutions coming to take {{up most of the}} legal system's energy and time. A poll tax was introduced in 1377 that spread the costs of the war in France more widely across the whole population. The tensions spilled over into violence in the summer of 1381 {{in the form of the}} Peasants' Revolt; a violent retribution followed, with as many as 7,000 alleged rebels executed. A new class of gentry emerged as a result of these changes, renting land from the major nobility to farm out at a profit. The legal system continued to expand during the 14th century, dealing with an ever-wider set of <b>complex</b> <b>problems.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Complex</b> <b>Problem</b> Solving (CPS) is a {{term that}} was {{introduced}} about 30 years ago in Germany by Dietrich Dörner. This movement established not only {{a new type of}} problem to be studied, a type that differed from “simple” problem solving in terms of complexity, temporal dynamics, and other attributes, but also a new method, namely, the use of computer-simulated microworlds. In this chapter, we focus on {{some of the issues that}} have been at the center of attention in the <b>complex</b> <b>problem</b> solving literature during the last years. The chapter is divided into four parts. In the first part, we briefly re-describe the historic roots of modern research on <b>complex</b> <b>problem</b> solving and establish a working definition of the concept. In part two, we discuss one specific issue that has been of interest in the <b>complex</b> <b>problem</b> solving community lately, namely, the question to what extent, if at all, <b>complex</b> <b>problem</b> solving performance might be related to intelligence. We discuss some of the older, and much of the most recent, research that has been concerned with exploring the link between intelligence and <b>complex</b> <b>problem</b> solving. In doing so, we differentiate between explicit and implicit <b>complex</b> <b>problem</b> solving. In the third part, we focus on the question to what extent, if at all, <b>complex</b> <b>problem</b> solving can be empirically distinguished from “simple” problem solving, and if there are domain specific or domain general principles at work. In the final part of the chapter, we present and discuss ten myths about <b>complex</b> <b>problem</b> solving that we believe very much hampers scientific progress in the area at the present time...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} whether experience with different computer-based <b>complex</b> <b>problem</b> situations would improve <b>complex</b> <b>problem</b> solving (CPS) competence in an unknown problem situation. We had N = 110 university students {{take part in}} a control group study. They were trained in five different <b>complex</b> <b>problem</b> situations for up to 7 hr, and their performance was tested in a sixth <b>complex</b> <b>problem</b> situation. The data analyses revealed that the training influenced the CPS process of knowledge ac- quisition. However, the CPS process of knowledge application was not impacted by experience with other problem situations. Implications for the concept of CPS as a trainable competence as well as the training of CPS in general are discussed...|$|R
25|$|Knowledge-representation is {{the field}} of {{artificial}} intelligence that focuses on designing computer representations that capture information about the world {{that can be used}} to solve <b>complex</b> <b>problems.</b> The justification for knowledge representation is that conventional procedural code is not the best formalism to use to solve <b>complex</b> <b>problems.</b> Knowledge representation makes complex software easier to define and maintain than procedural code and can be used in expert systems.|$|E

40|$|At {{the time}} when <b>complex</b> <b>problem</b> solving was {{established}} as a key aspect of today’s educational curricula and a central competence of international assessment frameworks like PISA, it became evident that the educational context places special demands on assessment instruments used for this purpose. In this chapter, we show how these challenges can successfully be addressed by reviewing recent advancements {{in the field of}} <b>complex</b> <b>problem</b> solving. We use the example of the Genetics Lab, a newly developed and psychometrically sound microworld which emphasizes usability and acceptance amongst students, to discuss challenges and opportunities of assessing <b>complex</b> <b>problem</b> solving in the classroom...|$|R

50|$|FEM is best {{understood}} from its practical application, known as {{finite element analysis}} (FEA). FEA as applied in engineering is a computational tool for performing engineering analysis. It includes the use of mesh generation techniques for dividing a <b>complex</b> <b>problem</b> into small elements, {{as well as the}} use of software program coded with FEM algorithm. In applying FEA, the <b>complex</b> <b>problem</b> is usually a physical system with the underlying physics such as the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation, the heat equation, or the Navier-Stokes equations expressed in either PDE or integral equations, while the divided small elements of the <b>complex</b> <b>problem</b> represent different areas in the physical system.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{relationships}} between structural knowledge, control performance and fluid intelligence in a <b>complex</b> <b>problem</b> solving (CPS) task. 75 participants received either complete, partial or no information regarding the underlying structure of a <b>complex</b> <b>problem</b> solving task, and controlled the task to reach specific goals. Control was best when complete structural information was available and was not better than random when no information was provided. In comparison to previous studies, a moderate to strong correlation between fluid intelligence and control performance was observed across all conditions. It appears that effective <b>complex</b> <b>problem</b> solving requires a combination of task-specific knowledge and abstract thinking skills. ...|$|R

25|$|Solutions of Laplace's {{equation}} {{are called}} harmonic functions; {{they are all}} analytic within the domain where the equation is satisfied. If any two functions are solutions to Laplace's equation (or any linear homogeneous differential equation), their sum (or any linear combination) is also a solution.

25|$|The {{finite element}} method (FEM) is a {{powerful}} technique originally developed for numerical solution of <b>complex</b> <b>problems</b> in structural mechanics, and it remains the method of choice for complex systems.

Elements may have physical properties such as thickness, coefficient of thermal expansion, density, Young's modulus, shear modulus and Poisson's ratio.|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} information overlap in groups discussing a <b>complex</b> <b>problem</b> on individual post-discussion <b>complex</b> <b>problem</b> solving (CPS). We hypothesize that information distribution among group members has an inverse u-shaped effect on individual post-discussion performance, favoring groups with a medium informational heterogeneity. As CPS is presumably correlated with experience, we also assume that exposure to the problem before the actual task leads to higher performance than less or no exposure. Experimental results support the first hypothesis: A medium overlap of instructional text paragraphs in dyads led to higher performance in a computer-simulated <b>complex</b> <b>problem</b> than complete or no overlap. The second hypothesis is not supported. Limitations {{of the study and}} practical implications are discussed...|$|R
