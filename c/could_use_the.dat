From Gibraltar, {{the lack of}} flying boats meant a lack of air cover after 100 miles. Nevertheless, great efforts were made with limited resources to provide cover from first to last light, the time when U-boats <b>could</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> rising and setting sun to see the silhouettes on the horizon.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Mainer and {{his wife}} settled in Flint, Michigan, where he found work at a General Motors factory. Although renouncing both the music {{industry}} and his trademark instrument, the banjo, he and Julia did continue to sing at gospel revival meetings. In the early 1960s, Molly O'Day convinced him that he <b>could</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> banjo in gospel recordings, which spurred a series of religiously themed banjo albums beginning in 1961. He also began to record and tour with his wife.|$|E
5|$|In March 1965, a NOTAM {{was issued}} of changes {{had been made}} into the {{arrangements}} for light aircraft crossing the Channel. These changes were partly to avoid conflict with traffic flying into Lydd (Ferryfield). Non-radio aircraft <b>could</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> route between Hythe and Ambleteuse. Non-radio aircraft were advised to call at Lympne before crossing. On 11 July, one of Skyways Coach Air's Avro 748s crashed on landing at Lympne.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} cast {{was listed}} in {{the first edition of}} The Country Wife, as was standard practice, and modern scholars have suggested that this information throws light on Wycherley's intentions. Wycherley wrote with the original actors in mind, tailoring the roles to their strengths. Also, since the audience consisted mostly of habitual playgoers, authors and directors <b>could</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> associations of an actor's previous repertoire to enrich or undercut a character, effects familiar on television and in the cinema today.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists {{developed}} the Late Bronze Age chronologies of eastern Mediterranean cultures by analysing {{the origin of}} artifacts (for example, items from Crete, mainland Greece, Cyprus or Canaan) found in each archaeological layer. If an artifact's origin can be accurately dated, it gives a reference date for the layer {{in which it is}} found. If the Thera eruption could be associated with a given layer of Cretan (or other) culture, chronologists <b>could</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> date of that layer to date the eruption itself. Since Thera's culture at the time of destruction was similar to the Late Minoan IA (LMIA) culture on Crete, LMIA is the baseline to establish chronology elsewhere. The eruption also aligns with Late Cycladic I (LCI) and Late Helladic I (LHI) cultures, but predates Peloponnesian LHI. Archeological digs on Akrotiri have also yielded fragments of nine Syro-Palestinian Middle Bronze II (MBII) gypsum vessels.|$|E
5|$|During a 1910s {{excavation}} for a sewer pipe, {{stones were}} unearthed that were suspected {{to be from}} the old van der Donck estate. During World War I, the Parade Ground was used to train soldiers. Eight tennis courts opened in 1914 with admission being $1 per person, and owing to the Van Cortlandt Golf Course's immense popularity, the Mosholu Links also opened that year. By 1917, the Parade Ground contained 10 out of the park's baseball diamonds. The park's recreational facilities were quite popular, with more than 10,000 people using them on a busy day. However, during and following World War I, the Parade Ground was used for war training. Until 1926, the baseball fields did not contain backstops, and had to be vacated by July 4 of every year, so the National Guard <b>could</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> field.|$|E

5|$|Finally, Universal's conduct {{amounted}} to {{an abuse of}} judicial process, {{and in that sense}} caused a longer harm to the public as a whole. Depending on the commercial results, Universal alternatively argued to the courts, first, that King Kong {{was a part of the}} public domain, and then second, that King Kong was not part of the public domain, and that Universal possessed exclusive trademark rights in it. Universal's assertions in court were based not on any good faith belief in their truth, but on the mistaken belief that it <b>could</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> courts to turn a profit.|$|E
5|$|Fonseca and the navy's {{high command}} {{were faced with}} two {{extremely}} unpalatable choices. They <b>could</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> government-controlled ships to attack and possibly destroy the rebel ships, but doing so would mean destroying three incredibly expensive ships that had received significant global attention and were—in their eyes—a crucial part of refashioning Brazil as a serious international power. Worse, {{there was a significant}} chance that the remaining Brazilian ships, all of which were smaller and much older than the ships controlled by the mutineers, would lose if it came to open combat. But by folding and giving into the rebel's list of demands—that is, demands from the underclass and broadly black naval crews—the elites would suffer an incredible embarrassment.|$|E
5|$|Her first {{acknowledgement}} on {{the national}} level was her appointment in 1919 to honorary vice president of the American Jewish Congress (AJC). Traditionally, the AJC leadership were more focused on European Jews than worldwide outreach and were of the aristocratic, wealthy, Reform tradition. By 1919 the organization had become more diverse and while not necessarily embracing the more radical aspects of Zionism, leaders allowed Zionist views to be expressed. Silverman, as an honorary official, <b>could</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> status to her advantage: while not officially speaking for the organization, she tacitly had AJC endorsement and was able to parlay that into support from the masses for causes and monetary contributions from elites.|$|E

During the six-day battle to secure the island, 4,706 Japanese {{soldiers}} and civilians were killed, while 172 Americans were killed, 902 were wounded, and 46 were missing. During the battle, famed war correspondent Ernie Pyle was killed by machine gun fire. Major General Bruce and his men buried Pyle on the island, later erecting a monument to him. Despite {{the fact that the}} Japanese had tried to destroy the airfields, army engineers were able to have all taxiways and runways fully operational by mid-May.|$|E
5|$|In November 2013, IBM {{announced}} it would make Watson's API available to software application providers, enabling them to build apps and services that are embedded in Watson's capabilities. To build out its base of partners who create applications on the Watson platform, IBM consults with a network of venture capital firms, which advise IBM on which of their portfolio companies may be a logical fit for what IBM calls the Watson Ecosystem. Thus far, roughly 800 organizations and individuals have signed up with IBM, with interest in creating applications that <b>could</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> Watson platform.|$|E
5|$|On {{returning}} to England in 1805, Brown began preparing {{an account of}} his Australian plant specimens. In September 1808, with Brown's account still far from finished, Swedish botanist Jonas Dryander asked him to prepare a separate paper on the Proteaceae, so that he <b>could</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> genera erected by Brown in a new edition of Hortus Kewensis. Brown immediately began {{a study of the}} Proteaceae, and in January 1809 he read to the Linnean Society of London a monograph on the family entitled On the Proteaceae of Jussieu. Among the eighteen new genera presented was one that Brown named Josephia in honour of Banks.|$|E

5|$|The 1980s saw {{the growth}} of {{speculative}} house building by developers. These introduced English brick and half-timbered vernacular styles to Scotland, which had been largely unknown before this period.

Sales of council houses were popular in Scotland and until the mid-1990s as, unlike in England, local authorities <b>could</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> whole of their capital receipts for development.

5|$|The A and B {{clarinets}} {{have nearly}} the same bore and use the same mouthpiece. Orchestral clarinetists using the A and B instruments in a concert <b>could</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> same mouthpiece (and often the same barrel) (see 'usage' below). The A and B have nearly identical tonal quality, although the A typically has a slightly warmer sound. The tone of the E clarinet is brighter and can be heard even through loud orchestral or concert band textures. The bass clarinet has a characteristically deep, mellow sound, while the alto clarinet is similar in tone to the bass (though not as dark).|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Ostrach, {{also called}} the Battle by Ostrach, {{occurred}} 20–23March 1799. In early March, the Army of the Danube pressed forward toward Pfullendorf and Ostrach, the former an imperial city in Upper Swabia and the latter a nearby village of 300belonging to the Imperial Abbey of Salem. Their goal was to cut the Austrian line at Switzerland, preventing the Coalition use of Switzerland as an overland route between central and southern Europe. This would ostensibly isolate the armies of the Coalition in northern Italy and Germany, and prevent them from assisting one another; furthermore, if the French held the interior passes in Switzerland, they <b>could</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> routes to move their own forces between the two theaters.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Aquinas, while proposing five proofs of God's {{existence}} in his Summa Theologica, objected to Anselm's argument. He suggested that people cannot know {{the nature of}} God and, therefore, cannot conceive of God in the way Anselm proposed. The ontological argument would be meaningful only to someone who understands the essence of God completely. Aquinas reasoned that, as only God can completely know His essence, only He <b>could</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> argument. His rejection of the ontological argument caused other Catholic theologians to also reject the argument.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{because of}} strict rules forbidding direct {{conversational}} {{interactions between the}} sexes, the gandingan presented a means for teenagers to interact with one another. Using the gandingan, {{young men and women}} would spend hours teasing, flirting, gossiping, playing guessing games, trading friendly insults and simply conversing with one another. For instance, if friends were telling a boy that a girl liked him but the boy didn’t like her back, the boy wouldn’t resort to telling his friends literally he didn’t like her. Instead, he <b>could</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> gandingan to express his reasons and his friends would be able to pick up the message by translating his song.|$|E
