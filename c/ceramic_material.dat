5|$|Only about 6% of {{the salt}} {{manufactured}} {{in the world is}} used in food. Of the remainder, 12% is used in water conditioning processes, 8% goes for de-icing highways and 6% is used in agriculture. The rest (68%) is used for manufacturing and other industrial processes, and sodium chloride {{is one of the largest}} inorganic raw materials used by volume. Its major chemical products are caustic soda and chlorine, which are separated by the electrolysis of a pure brine solution. These are used in the manufacture of PVC, plastics, paper pulp and many other inorganic and organic compounds. Salt is also used as a flux in the production of aluminium. For this purpose, a layer of melted salt floats on top of the molten metal and removes iron and other metal contaminants. It is also used in the manufacture of soaps and glycerine, where it is added to the vat to precipitate out the saponified products. As an emulsifier, salt is used in the manufacture of synthetic rubber, and another use is in the firing of pottery, when salt added to the furnace vaporises before condensing onto the surface of the <b>ceramic</b> <b>material,</b> forming a strong glaze.|$|E
5|$|The size of {{the welding}} torch nozzle depends {{on the amount of}} {{shielded}} area desired. The {{size of the}} gas nozzle depends upon the diameter of the electrode, the joint configuration, and the availability of access to the joint by the welder. The inside diameter of the nozzle is preferably at least three times the diameter of the electrode, but there are no hard rules. The welder judges the effectiveness of the shielding and increases the nozzle size to increase the area protected by the external gas shield as needed. The nozzle must be heat resistant and thus is normally made of alumina or a <b>ceramic</b> <b>material,</b> but fused quartz, a high purity glass, offers greater visibility. Devices can be inserted into the nozzle for special applications, such as gas lenses or valves to improve the control shielding gas flow to reduce turbulence and introduction of contaminated atmosphere into the shielded area. Hand switches to control welding current can be added to the manual GTAW torches.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis article makes a brief {{review on}} high-gravity {{combustion}} synthesis as a novel technique to prepare bulk <b>ceramic</b> <b>materials.</b> This technique combines strong exothermic combustion reactions with a high-gravity field, and provides an efficient way for rapid production of <b>ceramic</b> <b>materials.</b> In high-gravity combustion synthesis, <b>ceramic</b> <b>materials</b> are produced via melt solidification instead of conventional powder sintering. High-gravity combustion synthesis {{can be carried}} out by two modes of melt-casting and melt-infiltration. Melt-casting is usually used to produce bulk ceramics and glasses, and melt-infiltration is used to prepare cermets. By high-gravity combustion synthesis, a large variety of <b>ceramic</b> <b>materials</b> have been prepared, including single-phase ceramics, eutectic ceramics, glasses, glass-ceramics, and cermets. In contrast to powder sintering, high-gravity combustion synthesis offers a furnace-free way to produce <b>ceramic</b> <b>materials</b> with reduced processing time and lower energy consumption...|$|R

25|$|Clays exhibit {{plasticity}} when {{mixed with}} water in certain proportions. However, when dry, clay becomes firm and when fired in a kiln, permanent {{physical and chemical}} changes occur. These changes convert the clay into a <b>ceramic</b> <b>material.</b> Because of these properties, clay is used for making pottery, both utilitarian and decorative, and construction products, such as bricks, wall and floor tiles. Different types of clay, when used with different minerals and firing conditions, are used to produce earthenware, stoneware, and porcelain. Prehistoric humans discovered the useful properties of clay. Some of the earliest pottery shards recovered are from central Honshu, Japan. They {{are associated with the}} Jomon culture and deposits they were recovered from have been dated to around 14,000BC.|$|E
25|$|The Chernobyl melt was a {{silicate}} melt {{which contained}} inclusions of Zr/U phases, molten steel {{and high levels}} of uranium zirconium silicate ("chernobylite", a black and yellow technogenic mineral). The lava flow consists of more than one type of material—a brown lava and a porous <b>ceramic</b> <b>material</b> have been found. The uranium to zirconium ratio {{in different parts of the}} solid differs a lot, in the brown lava a uranium-rich phase with a U:Zr ratio of 19:3 to about 19:5 is found. The uranium-poor phase in the brown lava has a U:Zr ratio of about 1:10. It is possible from the examination of the Zr/U phases to determine the thermal history of the mixture. It can be shown that before the explosion, in part of the core the temperature was higher than 2000°C, while in some areas the temperature was over 2400–2600°C.|$|E
25|$|The femoral {{component}} is the component that fits in the femur (thigh bone). Bone is removed and the femur is shaped {{to accept the}} femoral stem with attached prosthetic femoral head (ball). There {{are two types of}} fixation: cemented and uncemented. Cemented stems use acrylic bone cement to form a mantle between the stem and to the bone. Uncemented stems use friction, shape and surface coatings to stimulate bone to remodel and bond to the implant. Stems are made of multiple materials (titanium, cobalt chromium, stainless steel, and polymer composites) and they can be monolithic or modular. Modular components consist of different head dimensions and/or modular neck orientations; these attach via a taper similar to a Morse taper. These options allow for variability in leg length, offset and version. Femoral heads are made of metal or <b>ceramic</b> <b>material.</b> Metal heads, made of cobalt chromium for hardness, are machined to size and then polished to reduce wear of the socket liner. Ceramic heads are more smooth than polished metal heads, have a lower coefficient of friction than a cobalt chrome head, and in theory will wear down the socket liner more slowly. As of early 2011, follow-up studies in patients have not demonstrated significant reductions in wear rates between the various types of femoral heads on the market. Ceramic implants are more brittle and may break after being implanted.|$|E
