5|$|In the 1930s, the Australian {{government}} was sufficiently {{concerned about the}} condition and lack of development of these leases that it held two inquiries between 1932 and 1938. Historian Ted Ling's accounts of those inquiries, however, make no mention of Muckaty, which was not singled out for <b>comment</b> <b>by</b> either investigation.|$|E
5|$|A {{class action}} lawsuit, Cook v. Rockwell International Corp., was filed in January 1990 against Rockwell and Dow Chemical (due to the {{indemnity}} of nuclear contractors, the award {{would have been}} paid by the federal government). Sixteen years later, the plaintiffs were awarded $926 million in economic damages, punitive damages, and interest. The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals subsequently threw out the verdict and ordered a retrial. A further appeal was rejected without <b>comment</b> <b>by</b> the United States Supreme Court in June 2012.|$|E
5|$|President Truman ordered {{military}} operations (including the B-29 bombings) to continue until official word of Japanese surrender was received. However, news correspondents incorrectly interpreted a <b>comment</b> <b>by</b> USAF commander Spaatz that the B-29s were not flying on August 11 (because of bad weather) as {{a statement that}} a ceasefire was in effect. To avoid giving the Japanese {{the impression that the}} Allies had abandoned peace efforts and resumed bombing, Truman then ordered a halt to further bombings.|$|E

5|$|The Plain English Campaign {{was set up}} in 1979 {{when the}} founder, Chrissie Maher, {{shredded}} hundreds of jargon-filled forms and documents in Parliament Square, London.

Although the Foot in Mouth award was first made in 1993, a specific acknowledgment was made to a <b>comment</b> <b>by</b> Dan Quayle, Vice President of the United States in 1991.|$|E
5|$|Depending on when Salmon graduated, {{it would}} seem that cricket was a normal {{activity}} at Oxford for some time before Phillips wrote his pamphlet. It was certainly well established at Oxford by October 1728 when the 19-year-old Samuel Johnson entered Pembroke College. He told James Boswell that cricket matches were played during the one year he was at Oxford and this was recorded by Boswell in his Life of Samuel Johnson. A <b>comment</b> <b>by</b> Horace Walpole confirms that cricket was being played at Eton during {{the first quarter of the}} 18th century. The earliest reference to cricket being played at Cambridge University is dated 1710 and both of those establishments were attended by William Goldwin who, in 1706, wrote a Latin poem of 95 lines on a rural cricket match. It was called In Certamen Pilae (On a Ball Game) and it was published in his Musae Juveniles.|$|E

25|$|Among the neo-Platonists and, later, their Christian interpreters, Aphrodite Ourania is {{associated}} with spiritual love, and Aphrodite Pandemos with physical love (desire).

25|$|However, {{a problem}} {{occurred}} when an off-the-record <b>comment</b> <b>by</b> Joseph Nye, then Carter’s Assistant Secretary of State for nuclear affairs, was reproduced {{in a newspaper}} article. Nye had stated that Brazil and West Germany would renounce the transfer of sensitive nuclear technology, such as enrichment and reprocessing plants, {{in exchange for the}} guarantee of nuclear fuel deliveries to Brazil. Hardliners within Brazil’s military regime strongly opposed those terms, which led the government to reject the U.S. proposal and harden its anti-NPT stance.|$|E

25|$|Although the pallium is now reserved, by law and liturgical norms, to metropolitans, {{a single}} {{standing}} exception {{has seemed to}} become customary: Pope John Paul II conferred a pallium on then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger when Ratzinger became Dean of the College of Cardinals and therefore also Cardinal Bishop of Ostia, a purely honorary title and one without an archbishopric or metropolitanate attached. When Ratzinger was elected Pope Benedict XVI, he continued that exception without <b>comment</b> <b>by</b> conferring the pallium on Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the new dean.|$|E
25|$|Wilson survived {{as leader}} of the Labour party in opposition. In the summer of 1973, holidaying on the Isles of Scilly, he tried to board a motor boat from a dinghy and stepped into the sea. He was unable to get into the boat and was left in the cold water, hanging on to the fenders of the motor boat. He was close to death before he was saved by passers by. The {{incident}} was taken up by the press and resulted in some embarrassment for Wilson; his press secretary, Joe Haines, tried to deflect some of the <b>comment</b> <b>by</b> blaming Wilson's dog for the problem.|$|E
25|$|In a 1997 {{paper on}} the effect of police hiring on crime rates, Levitt used the timing of mayoral and gubernatorial {{elections}} as an instrumental variable to identify a causal effect of police on crime. Past studies had been inconclusive because of the simultaneity inherent in police hiring (when crime increases, more police are hired to combat crime). The findings of this paper were found {{to be the result of}} a programming error. This was pointed out in a <b>comment</b> <b>by</b> Justin McCrary published in the American Economic Review in 2002. In a response published with McCrary's comment Levitt admits to the error and then goes on to offer alternative evidence to support his original conclusions.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the absent footage from the film are the other major attacks by Sauron on various regions of Middle-earth, referenced only briefly in the main text of The Return of the King, and expanded upon in the Appendices; the invasion of Rohan by the Orcs of Moria, the attacks on Lothlórien and the Woodland Realm of Thranduil {{by the forces of}} Dol Guldur, and the attack on Dale and the Lonely Mountain by a force of Easterlings. These events are hinted at in a <b>comment</b> <b>by</b> Legolas (also in the book) that the other peoples of Middle Earth will are unlikely to ride to war in Gondor because war has already arrived in their own lands.|$|E
25|$|Zelda {{travels to}} the Shrine of Gamelon to defeat the head-switching chimera Omfak and obtain the Wand needed to defeat Ganon, and she also visits Nokani Forest to obtain the magic lantern needed to clear the {{darkness}} around Ganon. Finally at Reesong Palace, Zelda fights Ganon, incapacitates him with the Wand, and rescues her father. Back at Hyrule Castle, Duke Onkled is {{turned over to the}} king, begging for mercy. He is arrested and the King orders him to scrub all the floors in Hyrule as punishment. Although Link's whereabouts are still unknown, a <b>comment</b> <b>by</b> Lady Alma prompts Zelda to throw her mirror against the wall, and as it smashes, Link magically materializes, seemingly having been trapped in the mirror. They then start laughing because they're happy that all is well again.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, the Middle East saw {{a number}} of pro-democratic uprisings, popularly known as the Arab Spring. The UAE saw {{comparatively}} little unrest, but did face one high-profile case in which five pro-democracy activists were arrested on charges of insulting the president, Sheikh Khalifa, the vice president, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, and the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi (and presumed successor to Sheikh Khalifa), Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The trial of the UAE Five attracted international publicity and protest from {{a number of}} human rights groups, including Amnesty International, which named the five men prisoners of conscience. The defendants were convicted and given two- to three-year prison sentences on 27 November 2011. However, all five were pardoned without <b>comment</b> <b>by</b> Sheikh Khalifa the following day.|$|E
