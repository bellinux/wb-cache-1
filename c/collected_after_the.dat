25|$|Drosera meristocaulis was {{discovered}} during a 1953 to 1954 expedition to Pico da Neblina {{led by the}} New York Botanical Garden. It was subsequently described in 1957 by Bassett Maguire and John Julius Wurdack in Memoirs of the New York Botanical Garden. Because of the isolated habitat in which D.meristocaulis is found, very few specimens of this species have been <b>collected.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> initial description, a second herbarium collection was made in 1985. When Maguire and Wurdack described the new species, they recognized how unique it was {{and placed it in}} its own section, Drosera sect. Meristocaulis, which they authored in the same publication. In a review of the taxonomy of the genus in 1996, botanist Jan Schlauer elevated the section to subgenus rank because of the species' unique, relict characteristics.|$|E
25|$|On several {{occasions}} {{during the course}} of the case study, the NIMH voiced misgivings about the lack of scientific data researchers generated from the case study and the disorganized state of project records. Outside of the linguistics aspect of research David Rigler did not clearly define any parameters for the scope of the study, and both the extremely high volume and incoherence of the research team's data left the scientists unable to determine the importance of much of the information they <b>collected.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> initial grant and a one-year extension Rigler proposed an additional three-year extension, and the NIMH's grants committee acknowledged that the study had clearly benefited Genie but concluded that the research team had not adequately addressed their concerns. In a unanimous decision the committee denied the extension request, cutting off further funding.|$|E

The [...] silver bars were taken under guard to the Defense Plant Corporation in Carteret, New Jersey, where they were cast into cylindrical billets, and then to Phelps Dodge in Bayway, New Jersey, where they were extruded into strips [...] thick, [...] wide and [...] long. Some 258 carloads were shipped under guard by rail to Allis-Chalmers in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where they were wound onto magnetic coils and sealed into welded casings. Finally, they moved by unguarded flatcars to the Clinton Engineer Works. There, special procedures were instituted for handling the silver. When they had to drill holes in it, they did so over paper so that the filings could be <b>collected.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> war, all the machinery was dismantled and cleaned and the floorboards beneath the machinery were ripped up and burned to recover minute amounts of silver. In the end, only 1/3,600,000th was lost. In May 1970, the last [...] of silver was replaced with copper {{and returned to the}} Treasury.|$|E

500|$|To combat {{this fiscal}} crisis, the Caliph would often {{personally}} devote {{himself to the}} supervision of revenue, acquiring a reputation, according to F. Malti-Douglas, for [...] "a spirit of economy, verging on avarice"; he was said to [...] "examine petty accounts that a commoner would scorn to consider" [...] (Harold Bowen). Fines and confiscations multiplied under his rule, with the resulting revenue, along with the income from the crown domain and even {{a portion of the}} provincial taxation, flowing to the caliphal privy purse (bayt al-māl al-khāṣṣa). The latter now acquired a leading role among the other fiscal departments, and it frequently held more money than the public treasury (bayt al-māl al-ʿāmma) itself. By the end of al-Mu'tadid's reign, the once empty privy purse would contain ten million dinars. On the other hand, in a measure aimed to ease the tax burden of the farmers, in 895 the Caliph changed the start of the tax year from the Persian New Year in March to 11 June—which became known as Nayrūz al-Muʿtaḍid, [...] "al-Mu'tadid's New Year"—so that the land tax (kharāj) was now <b>collected</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> harvest instead of before.|$|E
2500|$|Plumbbob Rainier was detonated at 899ft {{underground}} on 19 September 1957. The 1.7 kt explosion was {{the first}} to be entirely contained underground, producing no fallout. The test took place in a 1,600 – 2,000ft horizontal tunnel {{in the shape of a}} hook. The hook [...] "was designed so explosive force will seal off the non-curved portion of tunnel nearest the detonation before gases and fission fragments can be vented around the curve of the tunnel's hook". This test would become the prototype for larger, more powerful tests. Rainier was announced in advance, so that seismic stations could attempt to record a signal. Analysis of samples <b>collected</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> test enabled scientists to develop an understanding of underground explosions that [...] "persists essentially unaltered today". The information would later provide a basis for subsequent decisions to agree to the Limited Test Ban Treaty.|$|E

The church was consecrated by the Bishop of Wakefield on Tuesday 23 May 1893; his sermon was based on John xvi.14, He will glorify Me, for He will take of what is Mine and declare it to you.

2500|$|Sins of the Star Sapphire, {{running in}} Green Lantern Corps vol. 2, issues #29–32 (December 2008 – March 2009), {{is the story}} arc in which the {{formation}} of the Star Sapphires is shown. It both introduces important members of the new corps and reveals distinguishing features which set them apart from their peers. At the beginning of the arc, the Zamarons have crafted their own main power battery. Inside of their main battery are the crystallized [...] "Adam and Eve" [...] skeletons and Star Sapphire gem found when they first arrived on Zamaron. While experimenting with their new means of controlling the violet light of love, the Zamarons (perhaps intentionally) attracted the attention of the Guardians on Oa. Perceiving their visible power fluctuations as a threat, Guardian Scar decides to act on the display rather than wait and [...] "hope for the best." [...] In response, she requests a diplomatic audience with Zamaron's Queen Aga'po. Two other Guardians accompany her, while Lanterns Guy Gardner, Arisia, and Sodam Yat serve as escorts. While on Zamaron, the delegates from Oa find that the Zamarons are in possession of a number of yellow power rings that were left unclaimed after the Sinestro Corps War plotline. The rings are shown being drained of their power (which Arisia interprets as a deliberate display of how the same could be done to green power rings). More importantly, the delegates also discover that a number of female Sinestro Corps members have also been <b>collected</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> war and are imprisoned in violet crystals.|$|E

60|$|This prince {{was educated}} in a monastery, {{where he learned}} piety, continence, and humility, but nothing {{of the art of}} government. He was {{innocent}} and artless, but his views were narrow, and his genius contemptible. The character of such a prince is not, therefore, what influences the government, any further than as it puts it in the hands of others. When he came to the throne, Godwin, Earl of Kent, was the most popular man in England; he possessed a very great estate, an enterprising disposition, and an eloquence beyond the age he lived in; he was arrogant, imperious, assuming, and of a conscience which never put itself {{in the way of his}} interest. He had a considerable share in restoring Edward to the throne of his ancestors; and by this merit, joined to his popularity, he for some time directed everything according to his pleasure. He intended to fortify his interest by giving in marriage to the king his daughter, a lady of great beauty, great virtue, and an education beyond her sex. Godwin had, however, powerful rivals in the king's favor. This monarch, who possessed many of the private virtues, had a grateful remembrance of his favorable reception in Normandy; he caressed the people of that country, and promoted several to the first places, ecclesiastical and civil, in his kingdom. This begot an uneasiness in all the English; but Earl Godwin was particularly offended. The Normans, on the other hand, accused Godwin of a design on the crown, the justice of which imputation the whole tenor of his conduct evinced sufficiently. But as his cabals began to break into action before they were in perfect ripeness for it, the Norman party prevailed, and Godwin was banished. This man was not only very popular at home by his generosity and address, but he found means to engage even, foreigners in his interests. Baldwin, Earl of Flanders, gave him a very kind reception. By his assistance Godwin fitted out a fleet, hired a competent force, sailed to England, and having near Sandwich deceived the king's navy, he presented himself at London before he was expected. The king made ready as great a force as the time would admit to oppose him. The galleys of Edward and Godwin met on the Thames; but such was the general favor to Godwin, such the popularity of his cause, that the king's men threw down their arms, and refused to fight against their countrymen in favor of strangers. Edward was obliged to treat with his own subjects, and in consequence of this treaty to dismiss the Normans, whom he believed to be the best attached to his interests. Godwin used the power to which he was restored to gratify his personal revenge, showing no mercy to his enemies. Some of his sons behaved in the most tyrannical manner. The great lords of the kingdom envied and hated a greatness which annihilated the royal authority, eclipsed them, and oppressed the people; but Godwin's death soon after quieted for a while their murmurs. The king, who had the least share in the transactions of his own reign, and who was of a temper not to perceive his own insignificance, begun in his old age to think of a successor. He had no children: for some weak reasons of religion or personal dislike, he had never cohabited with his wife. He sent for his nephew Edward, the son of Edmund Ironside, out of Hungary, where he had taken refuge; but he died soon after he came to England, leaving a son called Edgar Atheling. The king himself irresolute in so momentous an affair, died without making any settlement. His reign was properly that of his great men, or rather of their factions. All of it that was his own was good. He was careful of the privileges of his subjects, and took care to have a body of the Saxon laws, very favorable to them, digested and enforced. He remitted the heavy imposition called Danegelt, amounting to 40,000l. a year, which had been constantly <b>collected</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> occasion had ceased; he even repaid to his subjects what he found in the treasury at his accession. In short, there is little in his life that can call his title to sanctity in question, though he can never be reckoned among the great kings.|$|E

The effect of material rheological characteristics and processing conditions on compounding of PC /PBT was investigated through statistical experiments carried out on a 58 mm twin-screw extruder at SABIC Innovative Plastics Limited (formerly GE Plastics Limited) in Cobourg, Ontario. Melt Volume-Flow Rate (MVR) is the most commonly used property to monitor the quality of products of PC/PBT blends. The MVR was studied with different sampling times and correlations between product properties (melt flow) and processing conditions (screw speed, flow rates) were discussed. The rheological behavior of PC/PBT blends was investigated by dynamic and capillary rheometers.
