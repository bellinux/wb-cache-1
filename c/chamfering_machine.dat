40|$|Generally the {{end mill}} of a <b>{{chamfering}}</b> <b>machine</b> {{has been used}} for chamfering the teeth of a gear. 　In the previous experiment on a rolling gear, a V-grooved collar was used to prevent the sides of the teeth from swelling. 　Now in one of these experiment, the teeth were almost made with a rolling die and the V-grooved collar, when a chamfering die was used in place of the collar so as to generate the part of the teeth to be chamfered in this way, generating and chamfering could be done at the same time. In the orther experiment, the tooth face of a gear, which had been cut roughly with a gear shaper, were finished with a rolling die, and chamfered with a chamfering die at the same time. 　The experimental results showed that the teeth of a gear could be chamfered effcientiy in process of rolling gear...|$|E

30|$|From the {{literature}} survey, many {{factors related to}} surface quality of the machined parts have been addressed, e.g., geometrical factor, micro-texture, and cutting parameters. However, there are few reports concerning the grinding texture on cutting tool flank face, in particular in the <b>chamfer</b> <b>machining</b> of hole. Therefore, this paper {{is focused on the}} relationship between the machined surface and grinding texture on flank face in the chamfer milling of stainless steel.|$|R

The remainder {{of this paper is}} organised as follows. Literature review is described in Section  2, followed by the manufacture of the chamfer cutting tool in Section  3, including mathematic models, numerical simulation, grinding simulation, etc. Experiment setups are presented in Section  4, and the experimental results of cutting force and surface quality are illustrated in Section  5.

40|$|In this paper, {{a change}} of die roll height {{according}} to the die chamfer shape and V-ring distance of a fine blanking tool was studied by experiments on a special part with various corner shapes. Three guide plate inserts with different V-ring positions and three die inserts with different die <b>chamfers</b> were <b>machined,</b> and then a fine blanking tool was manufactured for the fine blanking experiments. Nine experiments were conducted on a 650 -ton fine blanking press. Each die roll height was measured and analyzed. It would be noticed that the die roll heights on the corner shapes of the fine blanked parts increased with increasing V-ring distance and die chamfer angle, but it decreased with increasing corner radius and angle. The results in this study {{can be used to}} minimize the die roll height of fine blanked parts with corner shapes when designing the V-ring and die chamfer of a fine blanking tool...|$|R
40|$|Estimating the {{manufacturing}} cost {{is a critical}} task with high importance to industrial firms. The cost estimating can drive bidding strategies, management of resources, production policies and other issues crucial to the economic success of the company. Essentially, cost estimation should be quick and accurate. There are three main approaches towards cost estimation: estimation based on past experience (variant cost estimation), estimation based on explicit cost computations (analytical method) and parametric cost estimation. However, the most accurate cost estimates are made using the analytical approach. Among the many methods for cost estimating are those based on knowledge bases, features, operations, physical relationships and similarity laws. The {{aim of this study}} is to estimate different cost for the specific field of arc welding. It deals with assembly modeling welding. To do this, we have proposed a new application of feature: welding feature and preparation feature. This concept is based on the decomposition of the product in features. The proposed model presents a combination of two variants approach cost estimation based on characteristics of product and on manufacturing activity of process: • First, we developed an analytical method in order to estimate the welding time by determining the weight of the weld and this for each feature. Besides, we estimate others consumptions: gas, electrode and electrical power. • Second, we used parametric cost estimation for cost formulation due to deferent “feature cost” which compose the process of welding: Edge preparation (<b>chamfering,</b> bevel <b>machining,</b> grinding etc.), welding. This concept inquires the appropriate choice of the indicator. We have developed a database with Microsoft Access in order to estimate cost welding which use our model. This application, named SOUDABASE, helps in estimating welding time and cost. It will allow a relative novice to understand the effects of welding variables on production costs. Finally, we tested SOUDABASE application with industrial examples and we released a comparative study with DEVISOUD application proposed by CETIM, Senlis France in order to validate our model.
