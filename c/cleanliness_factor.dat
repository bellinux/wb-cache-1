However, with the flow of fluid for a long period, fouling occurs on the plate surface. Therefore, it is required to investigate the effect of fouling, wherever the heat exchanger is installed. An extensive experimental investigation has been carried out under clean and dirty condition of the said plate type heat exchanger. Heat transfer and flow data were collected in experiment. From collected data heat transfer rate, overall heat transfer coefficient, fouling factor and <b>cleanliness</b> <b>factor</b> were evaluated.

40|$|The {{design of}} a waste {{collection}} system affects public health, the extent {{of participation in the}} system by residents, the recovery of resources from waste, and the cost of collection. Many developing countries use communal container collection [CCC] systems in which large containers are dispersed throughout neighbourhoods for the storage of waste until collection. These systems tend to have limited success as they often do not garner viable amounts of participation and containers are prone to being overfilled. The communal container waste collection system in the city of Aguascalientes, AGS, Mexico was assessed according to the Integrated Solid Waste Management [ISWM] principles of social acceptability, environmental effectiveness, economic affordability and effective management. Information was collected through seven interviews with waste-related managers, 282 residential questionnaires, and 12 informal collector questionnaires. The collection system garners a high participation rate (99 %) attributed to: non-burdensome one-way distances from residences to containers (mean 114 +/- 71 m); thorough, daily collection; and a culture of <b>cleanliness.</b> <b>Factors</b> of adherence to waste collection regulations were found to be public knowledge, social acceptability, convenience and perception of importance. The collection system was assessed by rational-intuitive consideration of all indicators and principles, to be mostly acceptable from an ISWM framework due to: a high collection rate (~ 100 % daily) which is enabled by effective monitoring and efficient operation; a high participation rate; similarity of the resource recovery rate to that of other developing and developed countries; and long-term affordability. Areas for improvement in equality of service provision, collaboration with informal collectors, and communication were identified.

In some cases the range of effects discerned by a variable varies dramatically across studies, with mode specific constants providing a good example, whilst in others, such as with travel time variability or railway rolling stock, the precise nature of the variable being valued varies widely. For other variables, there is the problem that there is as yet insufficient empirical evidence or else there are problems of commercial confidentiality. Examples include the valuations of terminal facilities, advance purchase requirements and safety and <b>cleanliness</b> <b>factors,</b> but hopefully these problems will diminish over time and large scale quantitative reviews can be conducted in the future. The valuations are obtained from disaggregate behavioural models developed since 1980 which have been estimated to Revealed Preference (RP) or Stated Preference (SP) data.

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{manufacturing}} engineering, cleanroom technology has become a key technology {{for a number of}} reasons. Without it, trends such as enhanced performance and miniaturization or the adherence to legal requirements would be impossible to maintain. The main task of cleanroom technology is {{to reduce the amount of}} airborne contamination in manufacturing environments to an acceptable level. As the aim to control contamination in clean production facilities cannot be achieved by implementing cleanroom technology alone, a number of other measures need to be taken which also affect cleanliness levels. These measures are grouped together under the term "cleanliness technology" and include influencing factors such as personnel, logistics processes and manufacturing equipment, which together contribute significantly towards the contamination of a clean manufacturing environment. As today's trend towards increased automation continues, the subsystem of manufacturing equipment - including the materials used in its construction - has become the most important <b>factor</b> affecting <b>cleanliness.</b> In the meantime, the semiconductor industry calculates this to account for 40 % of the total contamination. Bearing this in mind, it is especially important to focus on equipment design, as this allows to consider and optimize cleanliness suitability early in the conception phase, e. g. by choosing appropriate materials or arranging components. Depending on the purpose of the equipment or the process to be carried out, the relevance of <b>cleanliness</b> <b>factors</b> such as particulate emission, cleanability, outgassing behavior, chemical resistance and microbiological properties need to be individually determined. In order to be able to use such information in the design and optimization of cleanliness-suitable equipment, international standardization work is currently being carried out (e. g. the amendment of the ISO 14644 series "Cleanrooms and associated controlled environments") to determine the cleanliness- and cleanroom- suitability of equipment and materials realistically and comparably according to international practiced methods.

Conventionally, the collectors are oriented either along North South or East West directions in most cases. However the energy collection, electricity generation and cost of electricity need to be found out for all possible collector-orientations lying between North South and East West. This can be used in designing collectors for places where the available land strip does not align with any of these two directions. In this work, explicit analytical expressions for energy losses due to cosine effect, end effect, shading and blocking are derived for any desired time interval as functions of length (L) and width (w) of aperture of reflector-row, spacing between adjacent reflector-rows (p), number of reflector-rows in a collector (n), height of receiver (H), collector-orientation angle (52) and location. The expressions for the net energy collected by the working fluid, electricity generated by a collector and the cost of electricity are presented. The effects of L, w, p, n, H, Omega and location on energy losses, net energy collection by fluid, electricity generation and cost of electricity are studied. The minimum cost of electricity is found out for different collector-orientations at various locations and relative comparisons have been made.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the effects of stochastic dust accumulations and rain events on the cleaning schedule of the parabolic trough collectors that are used to generate power at concentrated solar power (CSP) plants. The level of cleanliness is proportional to the power produced, and thus it affects the economic pay off at CSP plants. Current practice to address this dust problem, termed as conventional cleaning, is to follow a periodic cleaning schedule that entails a fixed setup cost for each cleaning event. The frequency of cleaning under such conventional (periodic schedule) policy is selected based upon a tradeoff between the set up cost and the payoff from improving the <b>cleanliness</b> <b>factor.</b> The conventional practice is to have a constant and periodic cleaning schedule over an entire season (e. g. either severe or mild combination of the dust and rain over a 180 -day cleaning season, with either 8 or 4 cycles scheduled for the severe and mild seasons respectively). This thesis draws upon evidence from recent literature to show that presence of random rain events improves the cleanliness of parabolic troughs in CSP plants. Upon analyzing such evidence, this study models rain event as a compound Poisson process that replenishes the level of cleanliness. In this scenario, it is possible to establish an adaptive threshold policy for scheduling plant cleaning that analogous to the formulation of a (s,S) inventory management policy, subject to random replenishment of inventory. The study offers a review of related literature to establish that such formulations are not amenable to a close form solution. The second half of the thesis describes a numerical study that has been conducted using Arena Simulation package for characterizing the adaptive cleaning policy. The parameter of interest for assessing system performance is the average payoff over the average cost of cleaning for a 180 -day cleaning season. Numerical study shows that adaptive cleaning policy outperforms the conventional (periodic) cleaning policy under reasonable assumptions for dust and rain event distributions. As an extension, the simulation study also examines the use of alternative cleaning system, known as electrodynamic screening (EDS), for different rain scenarios that may be used in conjunction with either conventional or adaptive cleaning policies to improve the overall system performance. 2019 - 07 - 09 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MScEng) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2013. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The coating thermal conductivity, the {{effective}} coated-tube thermal conductivity and the coating factor of three artificial protective coatings (APCs) applied to condenser tubes are experimentally evaluated. This testing broadens the limited available {{knowledge of these}} coatings, which is necessary for effective condenser refurbishment and operation. The coatings are applied to 25. 4 mm brass tubes at thicknesses of 44, 46, 50, and 130 μm. Steady state heat transfer tests are performed on these tubes fitted in a double-pipe counter-flow heat exchanger, with heated water in the annulus and coolingwater inside the tube. The experimentally determined thermal conductivities of the coatings range from 0. 5 to 2. 3 W/m·K. The effective coated-tube conductivity and the coating factor depend on the tube material and size, {{as well as the}} coating thickness. A one-dimensional condenser model is used to parametrically investigate the relative overall effect on condenser performance. From these results, coating guidelines for Admiralty brass tubes are proposed in terms of the minimum and maximum coating conductivity and thickness. The effect of the coating on the thermal performance is equivalent to a Heat Exchange Institute (HEI) <b>cleanliness</b> <b>factor</b> of at least 0. 85, when adhering to these guidelines. APCs provide a layer of protection against corrosion, erosion and fouling and can preferentially fill tube-wall pits. They can therefore be used to extend the condenser life-span effectively, but, to ensure minimal impact on the overall condenser performance, the coating thickness and conductivity must be carefully controlled and verified experimentally.

Hierdie evaluering verbreed die beperkte beskikbare kennis oor sodanige bedekkingslae, wat nodig is vir effektiewe kondensor herinrigting en bedryf. Die lae word teen diktes van 44, 46, 50 en 130 μm in 25. 4 mm geelkoperbuise aangewend. Warmteoordragstoetse by gestadigde toestande word gedoen op hierdie buise in ’n dubbelpyp-teenvloeiwarmteoordraer, met verhitte water in die annulus en verkoelingswater binne-in die buis. Die eksperimenteel bepaalde termiese geleidingkoëffisiënte wissel tussen 0. 5 tot 2. 3 W/m·K.

It evaluated RFGDT’s capacity to improve wetting effectiveness and minimize porosity. Twelve metal ceramic crowns were fabricated identically. RFGDT {{was applied to the}} metal substructures of half the specimens before the ceramic layering process. All specimens were fractured in the same manner by an applied compressive force to simulate dental occlusive failure. Fracture surfaces were inspected by light and scanning electron microscopy. Quantitative analyses of images were performed to identify numbers, locations of cracks, porosity patterns, and other morphological correlates of the fracture zones. There were significantly fewer voids per millimeter at the interfaces in the RFGDT group than in the non-RFGDT group (t = 2. 377, df = 9, p = 0. 021). There was {{a significant difference in the}} number of horizontal cracks per millimeter between the groups (t = 2. 132, df = 7, p = 0. 035), with more cracks occurring in the non-RFGDT group. RFGDT can improve the integrity of metal ceramic crowns by increasing the substratum surface energy, improving porcelain wetting and spreading and thereby diminishing the numbers of interfacial voids available for initiation of fracture. Routine application of RFGDT should result in fewer cracks along metal/ceramic interfaces in all restorative preparations.   </p...|$|R
