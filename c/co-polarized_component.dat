40|$|An {{expression}} is obtained {{on the basis}} of phase perturbation theory for the contribution to the mean differential reflection coefficient from the in-plane <b>co-polarized</b> <b>component</b> of the light scattered diffusely from a two-dimensional randomly rough dielectric surface when the latter is illuminated by s-polarized light. This result forms the basis for an approach to inverting experimental light scattering data to obtain the normalized surface height autocorrelation function of the surface. Several parametrized forms of this correlation function, and the minimization of a cost function with respect to the parameters defining these representations, are used in the inversion scheme. This approach also yields the rms height of the surface roughness, and the dielectric constant of the dielectric substrate if it is not known in advance. The input data used in validating this inversion consists of computer simulation results for surfaces defined by exponential and Gaussian surface height correlation functions, without and with the addition of multiplicative noise, for a single or multiple angles of incidence. The reconstructions obtained by this approach are quite accurate for weakly rough surfaces, and the proposed inversion scheme is computationally efficient. Comment: 19 pages, 9 figure...|$|E
40|$|A fractal-like (Cantor-like) {{stratified}} {{structure of}} chiral and convenient isotropic layers is considered. Peculiarities {{of the wave}} localization, self-similarity, scalability and sequential splitting in the reflected field of both the <b>co-polarized</b> and cross-polarized <b>components</b> are studied. The appearing of the additional peak multiplets in stopbands is revealed, and a correlation of their properties with chirality parameter is established. Comment: 10 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
50|$|CDR-mode cloud radars {{transmit}} a {{circularly polarized}} wave and receive <b>co-polarized</b> and cross-polarized <b>components.</b> The output polarimetric variable is the so-called circular depolarization ratio (CDR), and it is calculated as the ratio of cross-polarized power over the co-polarized power. In comparison with LDR, CDR is not affected by particles aligned in polarization plane, e.g. insects or ice crystals in electrified atmospheric conditions.|$|R
40|$|The {{scattering}} of a plane, linearly polarized electromagnetic wave by a sphere on whose surface an impedance boundary condition holds, {{and that is}} covered with a concentric layer of chiral material, is considered. Exact, explicit expressions are derived for the scattered field coefficients. The <b>co-polarized</b> and cross-polarized <b>components</b> of the far backscattered field are determined and discussed. The value of this canonical problem as a benchmark for computer codes is pointed out...|$|R
40|$|Abstractâ€”PEMC {{medium is}} a special type of {{metamaterial}} which generalizes the pre-existing concepts of perfect electric conductor (PEC) and perfect magnetic conductor (PMC). PEMC medium is described by a special parameter named as admittance which decides the nature of medium as PEC or PMC. Electromagnetic fields scattered by a PEMC sphere are investigated theoretically. A Hertz dipole {{as a source of}} excitation is considered. <b>Co-polarized</b> and cross-polarized <b>components</b> of the scattered fields are taken into consideration. A general solution of fields scattered by the PEMC sphere has been sought. 1...|$|R
40|$|A {{high-resolution}} channel sounding {{technique has}} been used to investigate the cross-polarization of electromagnetic waves in the 5 - 6 GHz band. Experiments were performed in two non-line-of-sight indoor locations, and it was found that there is a strong dependency of the cross-polarization of multipath components on the elevation angle-of-arrival. For a vertically polarized transmitting antenna, clusters of <b>co-polarized</b> multipath <b>components</b> were confined predominantly to the region around the horizontal plane that contains the virtual line-of-sight between transmitter and receiver. In contrast, cross-polarized signals were detected for a variety of elevation angles with considerable power levels. The surroundings of the receiver were identified as the principal source of depolarized signals. In addition, time dispersion analysis of the multipath signals led to the determination of the AoAs where there is a strong correspondence between co- and cross-polarized signals {{as a consequence of the}} partial depolarization of MPCs. This work supports the exploitation of the joint space and polarization diversities in indoor propagation scenarios to improve the system performance...|$|R
