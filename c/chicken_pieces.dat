5|$|Pan frying (or shallow frying) {{requires}} {{a frying pan}} of sturdy construction {{and a source of}} fat that does not fully immerse the chicken. The <b>chicken</b> <b>pieces</b> are prepared as above, then fried. Generally the fat is heated to a temperature hot enough to seal (without browning, at this point) the outside of the <b>chicken</b> <b>pieces.</b> Once the pieces {{have been added to the}} hot fat and sealed, the temperature is reduced. There is debate as to how often to turn the <b>chicken</b> <b>pieces,</b> with one camp arguing for often turning and even browning, and the other camp pushing for letting the pieces render skin side down and only turning when absolutely necessary. Once the <b>chicken</b> <b>pieces</b> are close to being done the temperature is raised and the pieces are browned to the desired color (some cooks add small amounts of butter at this point to enhance browning). The moisture from the chicken that sticks and browns on the bottom of the pan become the fonds required to make gravy.|$|E
5|$|Broasting uses a {{pressure}} cooker {{to accelerate the}} process. The moisture inside the chicken becomes steam and increases the pressure in the cooker, lowering the cooking temperature needed. The steam also cooks the chicken through, but still allows the pieces to be moist and tender while maintaining a crisp coating. Fat is heated in {{a pressure}} cooker. <b>Chicken</b> <b>pieces</b> are prepared as described above and then placed in the hot fat. The lid {{is placed on the}} pressure cooker, and the <b>chicken</b> <b>pieces</b> are thus fried under pressure.|$|E

The fat is heated in the deep fryer to the desired temperature. The pieces are added to the fat and a constant temperature is maintained throughout the cooking process.|$|E
5|$|Fried chicken (also {{referred}} to as Southern fried chicken for the variant in the United States) is a dish consisting of <b>chicken</b> <b>pieces</b> usually from broiler chickens which have been floured or battered and then pan-fried, deep fried, or pressure fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior. What separates fried chicken from other fried forms of chicken is that generally the chicken is cut at the joints, and the bones and skin are left intact. Crisp well-seasoned skin, rendered of excess fat, is a hallmark of well made fried chicken.|$|E

500|$|Before the {{industrialization}} {{of chicken}} production, {{and the creation}} of broiler breeds of chicken, only young spring chickens (pullets or cockerels) would be suitable for the higher heat and relatively fast cooking time of frying, making fried chicken a luxury of spring and summer. Older, tougher birds require longer cooking times at lower temperatures. To compensate for this, sometimes tougher birds are simmered till tender, allowed to cool and dry, and then fried. (This method is common in Australia.) Another method is to fry the <b>chicken</b> <b>pieces</b> using a pan fried method. The <b>chicken</b> <b>pieces</b> are then simmered in liquid, usually, a gravy made in the pan that the <b>chicken</b> <b>pieces</b> were cooked in. This process (of flouring, frying and simmering in gravy) is known as [...] "smothering" [...] and can be used for other tough cuts of meat, such as swiss steak. Smothered chicken is still consumed today, though with the exception of people who raise their own chickens, or who seek out stewing hens, it is primarily made using commercial broiler chickens.|$|E

500|$|KFC's {{core product}} {{offering}} is pressure fried, on-the-bone <b>chicken</b> <b>pieces</b> seasoned with Colonel Harland Sanders' [...] "Original Recipe" [...] of 11 herbs and spices. The product is typically available in either {{two or three}} piece individual servings, or in a family size cardboard bucket, typically holding between 6 and 16 <b>chicken</b> <b>pieces.</b> Poultry is divided into 9 different cuts (2 drumsticks, 2 thighs, 2 wings, 1 keel, and a backbone-based breast cut divided into 2 pieces). The product is hand-breaded at individual KFC outlets with wheat flour mixed with seasoning in a two- to four-minute process. It is then pressure fried for between seven and ten minutes (the timing differs between countries) in oil at 185 degrees Celsius. Following this, the chicken is left to stand for 5 minutes in order for it to sufficiently cool before it {{is placed in the}} warming oven. It is KFC policy to discard chicken if it has not been sold within 90 minutes, in order to ensure freshness. The frying oil varies regionally, and versions used include sunflower, soybean, rapeseed and palm oil. A KFC executive stated that the taste of the chicken will vary between regions depending on the oil variety used, and whether the chicken has been corn-fed or wheat-fed.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Foreign body {{impaction}} (FBI) in {{the esophagus}} {{can be a}} serious condition, which can have a high mortality among children and adults, if appropriate diagnosis and treatment are not instituted urgently. 80 – 90 % of all foreign bodies trapped in the esophagus usually pass spontaneously through the digestive tract, without any medical or surgical intervention. 10 – 20 % of them will need an endoscopic intervention. Case Report. We hereby present {{a case of a}} large <b>chicken</b> <b>piece</b> foreign body impaction in the esophagus in a 25 -year-old male with mental retardation. Patient developed hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation. The removal required endoscopic intervention. Conclusions. Foreign bodies trapped in the upper gastrointestinal tract are a serious condition that can be fatal if they are not managed correctly. A correct diagnosis and treatment decrease the chances of complications. Endoscopic treatment remains the gold standard for extracting foreign body impaction...|$|R

2500|$|In {{southern}} Germany homemade {{chicken soup}} typically consists of chicken broth, to which spices and semolina dumplings or Spätzle noodles are added. Another dish made with <b>chicken</b> broth, <b>pieces</b> of <b>chicken,</b> boiled vegetables, and spices {{is known as}} Hühnereintopf, meaning [...] "chicken stew". Alternatively, homemade noodles may {{be added to the}} chicken broth, without vegetables, and with only pickling spice, salt and pepper added to it.|$|R
500|$|To {{prepare the}} <b>chicken</b> <b>pieces</b> for frying, {{they may be}} coated in a batter of flour and liquid (and seasonings) mixed together. The batter can contain {{ingredients}} like eggs, milk, and leavening. Alternatively, they may be dredged in flour or a similar dry substance, to coat the meat {{and to develop a}} crust. Seasonings such as salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, or ranch dressing mix can be mixed in with the flour. Either process may be preceded by marination or by dipping in milk or buttermilk. As the pieces of chicken cook, some of the moisture that exudes from the chicken is absorbed by the coating of flour and browns along with the flour, creating a flavorful crust. According to Nathan Bailey's 1736 cookbook, Dictionarium Domesticum, for example, the chicken can be covered in a marinade that consists of the juice of two large fresh lemons, malt vinegar, bay leaves, salt, pepper, ground cloves, and green onions; it then must be settled in the marinade for three hours before being dipped in the batter that consists of all-purpose flour, white wine, three egg yolks and salt, and then slowly submerged in a deep pot of either oil, lard, or clarified butter over an open fire. [...] It can then be topped with fresh, dried parsley dipped in the same frying oil.|$|E
