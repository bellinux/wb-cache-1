Prevalence and mean intensity <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> <b>of</b> 450 convict cichlids and 70 mosquitofish were 55. 3 %/ 9. 3 and 11 %/ 1. 4, respectively. Overall prevalence and mean intensity <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> in the convict cichlid was higher in 2007 (92 %/ 12. 3) than in 2014 (37 %/ 5. 4).

40|$|We {{developed}} a screening procedure to identify small-molecule compounds that altered infection by Listeria monocytogenes to gain insights into bacterial/host cellular processes required for intracellular pathogenesis. A small-molecule library of 480 compounds with known biological functions was screened, and 21 compounds that altered the L. monocytogenes <b>infection</b> <b>of</b> murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) were iden-tified. The identified compounds affected various cellular functions, such as actin polymerization, kinase/ phosphatase activity, calcium signaling, and apoptosis. Pimozide, an FDA-approved drug {{used to treat}} severe Tourette’s syndrome and schizophrenia, was further examined and shown to decrease the bacterial uptake and vacuole escape of L. monocytogenes in BMM. The inhibitory effect of pimozide on internalization was not specific for L. monocytogenes, as the phagocytosis of other bacterial species (Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Escherichia coli K 12) was significantly inhibited {{in the presence of}} pimozide. The invasion and cell-to-cell spread of L. monocytogenes during the <b>infection</b> <b>of</b> nonprofessional phagocytic cells also was decreased by pimozide treatment. Although pimozide has been reported to be an antagonist of mammalian cell calcium <b>channels,</b> the <b>infection</b> <b>of</b> BMM in a calcium-free medium did not relieve the inhibitory effects of pimozide on L. monocytogenes infection.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{established}} that chlorella viruses encode K+ channels with different structural and functional properties. In the current study, we exploit the different sensitivities <b>of</b> these <b>channels</b> to Cs+ {{to determine if}} the membrane depolarization observed during virus infection is caused by the activities <b>of</b> these <b>channels.</b> <b>Infection</b> <b>of</b> Chlorella NC 64 A with four viruses caused rapid membrane depolarization of similar amplitudes, but with different kinetics. Depolarization was fastest after infection with virus SC- 1 A (half time [t 1 / 2], about 9 min) and slowest with virus NY- 2 A (t 1 / 2, about 12 min). Cs+ inhibited membrane depolarization only in viruses that encode a Cs+-sensitive K+ channel. Collectively, the results indicate that membrane depolarization is an early event in chlorella virus-host interactions and that it is correlated with viral-channel activity. This suggestion was supported by investigations of thin sections of Chlorella cells, which show that channel blockers inhibit virus DNA release into the host cell. Together, the data indicate that the channel is probably packaged in the virion, presumably in its internal membrane. We hypothesize that fusion of the virus internal membrane with the host plasma membrane results in an increase in K+ conductance and membrane depolarization; this depolarization lowers the energy barrier for DNA release into the host...|$|R

40|$|Background: The key {{epidemiological}} {{difference between}} pandemic and seasonal influenza {{is that the}} population is largely susceptible during a pandemic, whereas, during non-pandemic seasons a level of immunity exists. The population-level efficacy of household-based mitigation strategies depends on the proportion <b>of</b> <b>infections</b> that occur within households. In general, mitigation measures such as isolation and quarantine are more effective at the population level if the proportion of household transmission is low. Methods/Results: We calculated the proportion <b>of</b> <b>infections</b> within households during pandemic years compared with non-pandemic years using a deterministic model of household transmission in which all combinations of household size and individual infection states were enumerated explicitly. We found that the proportion <b>of</b> <b>infections</b> that occur within households was only partially influenced by the hazard h <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> within household relative to the hazard <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> outside the household, especially for small basic reproductive numbers. During pandemics, the number <b>of</b> within-household <b>infections</b> was lower than one might expect for a given h {{because many of the}} susceptible individuals were infected from the community and the number of susceptible individuals within household was thus depleted rapidly. In addition, we found that for the value of h at which 30 % <b>of</b> <b>infections</b> occur within households during non-pandemic years, a similar 31 % <b>of</b> <b>infections</b> occur within households during pandemic years. Interpretation: We suggest that a trade off between the community force <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> and the number of susceptible individuals in a household explains an apparent invariance in the proportion <b>of</b> <b>infections</b> that occur in households in our model. During a pandemic, although there are more susceptible individuals in a household, the community force <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> is very high.
