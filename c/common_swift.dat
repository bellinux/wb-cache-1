5|$|The calls {{given by}} flocks near the {{breeding}} areas are typical swift screams, including a trilled tsiririri or harsher spee-eer. They resemble {{the cries of}} the <b>common</b> <b>swift,</b> but are softer and less wheezy. Pacific swifts are less vocal on the wintering grounds, but produce a variety of twitters and buzzes.|$|E
5|$|Parsnip {{is used as}} a {{food plant}} by the larvae of some {{lepidopteran}} species, including the parsnip swallowtail (Papilio polyxenes), the <b>common</b> <b>swift</b> moth (Korscheltellus lupulina), the garden dart moth (Euxoa nigricans), and the ghost moth (Hepialus humuli). The larvae of the parsnip moth (Depressaria radiella), native to Europe and accidentally introduced to North America in the mid-1800s, construct their webs on the umbels, feeding on flowers and partially developed seeds.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific swift (Apus pacificus) is a bird which breeds {{in eastern}} Asia. This swift is {{strongly}} migratory, spending the northern hemisphere's winter in Southeast Asia and Australia. The general shape and blackish plumage recall its relative, the <b>common</b> <b>swift,</b> {{from which it}} is distinguished by a white rump band and heavily marked underparts. The sexes are identical in appearance, although young birds can be identified by pale fringes to the wing feathers that are absent in adults. This swift's main call is a screech typical of its family. It {{is one of a}} group of closely related Asian swifts formerly regarded as one species.|$|E
40|$|During {{the spring}} 2015, {{a pair of}} Common Redstarts Phoenicurus phoenicurus {{successfully}} raised a five-chick brood in an artificial nest-box designed for and occupied {{by a pair of}} <b>Common</b> <b>Swifts</b> Apus apus in southern Sweden. The breeding was monitored by a nest-box camera, which recorded close interactions between the two species. The Common Redstarts initiated the breeding first and had young in the nest when the <b>Common</b> <b>Swifts</b> arrived and initiated breeding by laying their eggs in a nearby nest cup. The breeding overlapped by 15 days between the second and the fourth week of June when all five of the nestlings of the Common Redstart fledged. The <b>Common</b> <b>Swifts</b> raised two young which fledged in early August...|$|R

40|$|Forty <b>common</b> <b>swifts</b> (Apus apus), synanthropic birds {{living in}} an urban {{environment}} closely with humans and other animals, were hospitalized in the public veterinary hospital of the Regional Reference Center of Urban Veterinary Hygiene located in Naples, Campania Region, Italy. Each bird was sampled for bacteriological analyses. Out of 40 <b>common</b> <b>swifts</b> examined, eight were found positive for Salmonella enterica serovar Infantis although no sign of salmonellosis (e. g. diarrhoea) was shown. Our results suggest this avian species as a novel potential reservoir for one of most important Salmonella serovars...|$|R
5|$|This {{species is}} usually {{straightforward}} to identify. The white-rumped swift {{is similar to}} Pacific swift, but its slender body and long, deeply forked tail make it appear quite different from its more powerfully built relative. A possible pitfall is a partially leucistic <b>common</b> <b>swift</b> with a white rump. The Pacific swift can be distinguished with care by its deeper tail fork, longer wings, bigger head, larger white throat patch and patterned underparts. In parts of Southeast Asia, migrating Pacific swifts pass through the resident ranges of former subspecies, and good views are then necessary {{to be sure of}} correct identification.|$|E
5|$|Arthropods {{that are}} Narcissus pests include insects such as three species of fly that have larvae that attack the plants, {{narcissus}} bulb fly Merodon equestris, and two species of hoverflies, the lesser bulb flies Eumerus tuberculatus and Eumerus strigatus. The flies lay their eggs {{at the end of}} June in the ground around the narcissi, a single female fly being able to lay up to fifty eggs. The hatching larvae then burrow through the soil towards the bulbs and consume their interiors. They then overwinter in the empty bulb shell, emerging in April to pupate in the soil, from which the adult fly emerges in May. The larvae of some moths such as Korscheltellus lupulina (the <b>common</b> <b>swift</b> moth) attack Narcissus bulbs.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific swift has a {{very large}} range, {{exceeding}} 10,000,000km2 (3,800,000mi2). Its population is unknown, although it is common throughout its breeding range with {{no evidence of any}} decline. It is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern. There appear to be no significant threats to this bird; predation is low, and this swift is not tied to a particular habitat. Some birds may die through misadventure or become exhausted when lost on migration (the first record for the Western Palaearctic was found resting on a North Sea gas platform), but swifts have high survival rates and are generally long-lived. The <b>common</b> <b>swift,</b> a close relative of the Pacific swift, has been recorded as reaching 21years old.|$|E
50|$|<b>Common</b> <b>swifts</b> are migratory. Their summer {{breeding}} range runs from Spain and Ireland in the West across to China and Siberia in the East. They breed {{as far south}} as Northern Africa (in Morocco and Algeria), with a presence in the Middle East in Israel, Lebanon and Syria, the Near East across Turkey, and the whole of Europe as far north as Norway, Finland, and most of sub-Arctic Russia. Swifts migrate to Africa by a variety of routes, ending up in Equatorial and Sub-Equatorial Africa, excluding the Cape. <b>Common</b> <b>swifts</b> do not breed on the Indian Subcontinent.|$|R
5000|$|Parnara guttata, the <b>common</b> {{straight}} <b>swift,</b> is {{a butterfly}} {{of the family}} Hesperiidae. It {{is found in the}} Indomalaya ecozone, Amur (Russian Far East), eastern China and Japan. Its wingspan is about 40 mm. [...] <b>Common</b> straight <b>swift</b> larvae feed on various grasses, including rice.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the modern}} day spinners' weasels are even less <b>common</b> than <b>swifts.</b>|$|R
5|$|All swifts feed on insects {{caught in}} flight, and the Pacific swift has been {{recorded}} as consuming bees, wasps, termites, moths and flies. A Chinese study found that it caught {{a wide variety of}} insect prey and considered that most of the species eaten were harmful to agriculture or forestry. The Pacific swift tends to hunt higher than sympatric swifts, sharing its airspace mainly with white-throated needletails. It typically feeds at heights up to , only flying close to the ground in poor weather. It often forages near low-pressure areas, which serve both to raise insects from the ground and to give the swifts additional lift. The swifts circle through the insect swarms in flocks typically of tens or hundreds of birds, although sometimes reaching tens of thousands in Australia. In Siberia, Pacific swifts feed at dusk to much later hours than the <b>common</b> <b>swift,</b> sometimes until midnight, and migrants have been seen flying with bats in the Philippines. The young are brought balls of insects bound with saliva. In bad weather, they are sometimes not fed for days, surviving on stored body fat.|$|E
25|$|Slugs and snails {{are serious}} pests {{in some parts}} of the world, {{particularly}} in spring when new growth is emerging through the soil. Earwigs can also disfigure the blooms. The other main pests likely to be encountered are aphids (usually on young stems and immature flower buds), red spider mite (causing foliage mottling and discolouration, worse in hot and dry conditions) and capsid bugs (resulting in contortion and holes at growing tips). Diseases affecting dahlias include powdery mildew, grey mould (Botrytis cinerea), verticillium wilt, dahlia smut (Entyloma calendulae f. dahliae), phytophthora and some plant viruses. Dahlias are a source of food for the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including angle shades, <b>common</b> <b>swift,</b> ghost moth and large yellow underwing.|$|E
500|$|A mainly aerial species, this swift is {{not limited}} to {{particular}} land habitats or climatic zones; it breeds from the Arctic to sub-tropical China, and from sea level to at least [...] in Japan. It is often found around human habitation. It tends to winter in lowlands, and in Australia it is found in arid areas as well as in towns and on the coast. Flocks of thousands may appear when there are hot strong winds. Pacific swifts often travel and feed with white-throated needletails. The Pacific swift probably sleeps in flight when not nesting, behaviour known to occur in the <b>common</b> <b>swift</b> and suspected in other Apus species, but there is an Australian record of these swifts roosting in a tree, and they are occasionally seen to land briefly on the ground or on vertical surfaces.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} seabirds {{can be seen}} close to the seaside, which is home to colonies of cormorants, gulls, razorbills, {{northern}} gannets, common murres and Atlantic puffins.

Females are {{slightly}} heavier than males, averaging [...] against [...] It is similar in general shape to the <b>common</b> <b>swift,</b> although slightly longer-winged and with a more protruding head. The fork of the tail is deeper, and the rump is broader. The upperparts are black, apart from a white rump band and a somewhat greyer head. The underparts are black, although white fringes to the feathers gives the belly a scaly appearance when seen well from below. The tail and the upper wings are black, and the underwings are brown. The eyes are brown and the small bill and very short legs are black. The sexes are identically plumaged, and juveniles differ from the adults only in that the feathers show pale fringes, particularly on the wings. The southern subspecies, A. p. kurodae, has a narrower white rump (15mm/0.6in against the nominate form's 20mm/0.8in), a grey throat and blacker underparts. Juveniles of migratory Apus swifts have a partial moult prior to migration, but retain the larger wing feathers. The moult is completed in the wintering grounds, where adults have a complete moult.|$|E

6000|$|... 113. Lastly, in Zoology. What the Greeks {{did for the}} horse, and what, as far {{as regards}} {{domestic}} and expressional character, Landseer has done for the dog and the deer, {{remains to be done}} by art for nearly all other animals of high organisation. There are few birds or beasts that have not a range of character which, if not equal to that of the horse or dog, is yet as interesting within narrower limits, and often in grotesqueness, intensity, or wild and timid pathos, more singular and mysterious. Whatever love of humour you have,--whatever sympathy with imperfect, but most subtle, feeling,--whatever perception of sublimity in conditions of fatal power, may here find fullest occupation: all these being joined, in the strong animal races, to a variable and fantastic beauty far beyond anything that merely formative art has yet conceived. I have placed in your Educational series a wing by Albert Dürer, which goes as far as art yet has reached in delineation of plumage; while for the simple action of the pinion it is impossible to go beyond what has been done already by Titian and Tintoret; but you cannot so much as once look at the rufflings of the plumes of a pelican pluming itself after {{it has been in the}} water, or carefully draw the contours of the wing either of a vulture or a <b>common</b> <b>swift,</b> or paint the rose and vermilion on that of a flamingo, without receiving almost a new conception of the meaning of form and colour in creation.|$|E

On the barren, rocky land there are Barbary ground squirrels and geckos. Fuerteventura also hosts several migratory and nesting birds. The island has significant populations of the collared dove, <b>common</b> <b>swifts</b> and several finch species especially in the vicinity of holiday developments.|$|R
50|$|<b>Common</b> <b>swifts</b> nest in a {{wider variety}} of sites than any other species of Apus. Swifts usually nest in {{buildings}} but they can also be found nesting in holes in trees, cliffs and crevices, and even in nestboxes. Swifts usually enter their nesting holes with direct flight, and take-off is characterized by an initial free-fall. Empty cavities are shallower than those with nests, and the entry size is smaller in the former than in the latter.|$|R

50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>swift</b> (Apus apus) was {{the best}} {{candidate}} for research aimed at determining whether or not birds exhibiting USWS can sleep in flight. The selection of the <b>common</b> <b>swift</b> as a model stemmed from observations elucidating {{the fact that the}} <b>common</b> <b>swift</b> left its nest at night, only returning in the early morning. Still, evidence for USWS is strictly circumstantial and based on the notion that if swifts must sleep to survive, they must do so via aerial roosting as little time is spent sleeping in a nest.|$|E
50|$|Alpine swifts {{are readily}} {{distinguished}} from the <b>common</b> <b>swifts</b> by their larger size and their white belly and throat. They are around twice as big as most other swifts in its range, about 20 to 23 cm in length, with a wingspan of 57 cm and a weight of around 100 g. They're largely dark brown in colour, with white patches underneath the beak and on the breast that are separated by a dark brown streak. Juveniles are similar to adults, but their feathers are pale edged.|$|R
50|$|Alpine swifts {{breed in}} {{mountains}} from southern Europe to the Himalaya. Like <b>common</b> <b>swifts,</b> they are strongly migratory, and winter much further south in southern Africa. They wander widely on migration, and are regularly seen {{in much of}} southern Europe and Asia. The species {{seems to have been}} much more widespread during the last ice age, with a large colony breeding, for example in the Late Pleistocene Cave No 16, Bulgaria, around 18,000-40,000 years ago. The same situation has been found for Komarowa Cave near Częstochowa, Poland during a period about 20,000-40,000 years ago.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} endemic bird species {{including}} the Raso lark {{along with more}} <b>common</b> <b>swifts,</b> larks, warblers, and sparrows.

5000|$|Tenison {{introduced}} a Bill of Residence in the Irish Parliament in December 1731, {{and became a}} literary target for Jonathan Swift. Swift found Tenison's politics objectionable, and in his poem On the Irish Bishops attacked Tenison's support for the Bill of Residence, and a Bill of Division, both concerned with Irish clerical livings. The phrase [...] "baboon of Kilkenny" [...] in the poem is taken to be an allusion to Tenison. In February 1732 the Bills passed the Irish House of Lords but were rejected by the Irish House of <b>Commons.</b> <b>Swift</b> left a manuscript giving {{the case against the}} Bill.|$|R
40|$|<b>Common</b> <b>swifts</b> are {{specialist}} flyers {{spending most}} of their life aloft, including night-time periods when this species roosts on the wing. Nocturnal roosting is preceded by a vertical ascent in twilight conditions towards altitudes of up to 2. 5 km, behaviour previously explained as flight altitude selection for sleeping. We examined the nocturnal flight behaviour of swifts, as uniquely identified by a Doppler weather radar in central Netherlands using continuous measurements during two consecutive breeding seasons. <b>Common</b> <b>swifts</b> performed twilight ascents not only at dusk but also at dawn, which casts {{new light on the}} purpose of these ascents. Dusk and dawn ascents were mirror images of each other when time-referenced to the moment of sunset and sunrise, suggesting that the acquisition of twilight-specific light-based cues {{plays an important role in}} the progression of the ascents. Ascent height was well explained by the altitude of the 280 K isotherm, and was not significantly related to wind, cloud base height, humidity or the presence of nocturnal insects. We hypothesize that swifts profile the state of the atmospheric boundary layer during twilight ascents and/or attempt to maximize their perceptual range for visual access to distant horizontal landmarks, including surrounding weather. We compare twilight profiling by swifts with vertical twilight movements observed in other taxa, proposed to be related to orientation and navigation.
