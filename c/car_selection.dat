50|$|Small {{cars were}} at first {{packaged}} in both picture boxes and blister packs. Boxes were dropped entirely by the mid-1980s. Large models were mostly packed in window boxes, {{with a few}} exceptions. One unfortunate design element in this time period was the unrealistic and rather gaudy white-walled tires labeled with 'Siku' {{on opposite sides of}} each tire and with and white 'spoked' wheels that appeared on most vehicles in this series. Fortunately, by the late 1990s, realistic wheel designs were adopted, like accurate mini mags for the Mini Cooper seen on this page. This series is still produced today, and since the incorporation of the Club Series (see below) in the early 1990s, large trucks as well as military tanks and a few aircraft {{have been made in the}} small car size and put in blister packages. Of course, their scale varied greatly too. Hence, a unified scale of 1:55 (or 1:60 for cars from the V series) is not uniformly applied.Siku keeps up with odd German sports <b>cars</b> <b>selections</b> like the Gumpert Apollo or the Wiesmann GT. Occasionally Siku outdoes itself with a very odd model. Sixteen inch tall cranes have been produced, helicopters on flat bed semi trucks, forestry log loaders, piston bully snow tracked vehicles, an ultra-detailed stake bed Mercedes Unimog, potato digger truck, triple engined competition pulling tractor and modern tram and subway cars. Perhaps the most outrageous is the AIDA Aluna 10 story plus cruise ship in 1:1,400 scale (18 cm long).|$|R
5000|$|In Chrysler Classic Racing, {{the player}} races classic Chrysler cars on various tracks.

The <b>car</b> <b>selection</b> {{features}} Chrysler cars from the 1950s through the 1970s. Races mostly feature standard Wii controls, and require use of the Wii Remote nunchuk attachment.

5000|$|Trent C. Ward of IGN {{rated the}} PC version 7.8 and wrote that it was, [...] "Blessed with solid graphics, great sound, {{and some of}} the finest cars ever {{included}} in a racing game". However, Ward felt that the game's computer-controlled racers were capable of maneuvers not possible for the player to perform: [...] "When you're racing, if another car pulls up behind you and taps you on the rear bumper, your car immediately goes flying out of control. While this seems reasonable (if a tad excessive), the same trick just doesn't work if you try to do it back. Shove an opponent's car from behind, and you're a lot more likely to end up in the ditch than he is. ... The way it is, the most you'll get is about three or four races before the computer pulls a dirty trick so foul that you'll turn your computer off in disgust." [...] Ward concluded that Test Drive 5 [...] "comes really close to greatness, and then veers off sharply at the last minute. The game's solid handling, great <b>car</b> <b>selection,</b> and passable graphics are all ruined by the fact that computer-controlled cars can pitch you off the road at any given moment and by the fact that even with the fastest cars at your disposal, you'll probably find yourself struggling {{to keep up with the}} slowest computer opponents." ...|$|E

40|$|Increased {{demands on}} rare earth {{fossil fuels and}} the global warming have led to {{development}} of alternative technology vehicles. Electrical vehicle (EV) is chosen {{as one of the}} alternative technology to overcome these hindrances. In EVs the battery and the motor are the two most critical components used for generating the required power output. In this paper, work was done for selection battery technology and relevant packaging for a small car. The work done is described in four stages: i) battery selection based on literature, ii) <b>car</b> <b>selection</b> based on virtual reality (VR) study iii) battery package design, and iv) finally specification sheet was developed for an EV. Key Objectives considered for the battery selection are: i) minimal maintenance, ii) modular and scalable, iii) high energy density, iv) optimized thermal management, and v) low cost implications. A detailed study was conducted on current literature and state of art of batteries and solution adopted in available commercial cars. To develop a novel battery package, primarily the <b>car</b> <b>selection</b> was done.

Each improvement on a car has a strategic meaning for our daily life and makes more competition in the strategic management. It is important to evaluate consumer preferences that provide attributes that make consumer decision-making easier. This paper researches consumer preferences of luxury car features using an analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Initially the most important key factors which influencing the choosing the car brands were identified. Then these factors have been evaluated by the experienced car sale representatives. At the evaluation procedure, the AHP was applied to determine the relative weights of evaluation criteria. This paper results have carried that flexibility and then brand image are the customers’ most important criteria for <b>car</b> <b>selection.</b> The findings of the study provide useful insight in the luxury car brand consumer preferences for future strategy decision making procedures...|$|E
40|$|The paper investigates a {{technique}} for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method to solve multi-attribute decision making problems with bipolar neutrosophic information. We define Hamming distance function and Euclidean distance function {{to determine the}} distance between bipolar neutrosophic numbers. In the decision making situation, the rating of performance values of the alternatives {{with respect to the}} attributes are provided by the decision maker in terms of bipolar neutrosophic numbers. The weights of the attributes are determined using maximizing deviation method. We define bipolar neutrosophic relative positive ideal solution (BNRPIS) and bipolar neutrosophic relative negative ideal solution (BNRNIS). Then, the ranking order of the alternatives is obtained by TOPSIS method and most desirable alternative is selected. Finally, a numerical example for <b>car</b> <b>selection</b> is solved to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach and comparison with other existing method is also provided...|$|E

Being based on purely mathematical data, these techniques have significant drawbacks especially when we want to consider qualitative factors, which are very important in supplier selection and {{are not easy to}} measure. Some innovative approaches, based on artificial intelligence techniques such as Fuzzy Logic match very well with decision-making situations especially when decision makers express heterogeneous judgments. In this research, by the combination of Fuzzy logic and the House of Quality (HOQ), qualitative criteria are considered in the forward parts of <b>car</b> suppliers’ <b>selection</b> process in Sazehgostar SAIPA Company.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{the study of the}} dynamic {{behavior}} of a F 1 <b>car</b> gear <b>selection</b> hydraulic circuit, when involved in different shift transients. In {{the first part of the}} paper the actual circuit is described, and the main hypotheses adopted for the numerical modeling of the hydraulic power unit, of the control valves, of hydraulic pipes and of the actuators involved in the gear shift cycles are introduced. Particular attention is devoted to the actuators actual sequences, as applied by the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) to the servo- valves deputed to actuators control. The strategy to define each gear shift cycle in terms of actuators working position in time domain is chosen, using the frequency map of each servo-valve. A numerical versus experimental comparison of the behavior of the actuators involved in the gear selection (during about 50 ms for an up shifting and 100 ms for a down shifting) is performed, with the target to define the validity limits of the numerical model results. Finally, the paper reports the analysis of those hydraulic variables not controlled by the on-board diagnostic, with the aim to analyze the behavior of the power unit and of the pipes when submitted to the sudden hydraulic power request correspondent to a gear shift...|$|R
