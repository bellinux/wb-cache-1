50|$|Microfiber {{products}} {{used for}} consumer cleaning are generally constructed from split <b>conjugated</b> <b>fibers</b> of polyester and polyamide. Microfiber used for commercial cleaning products also includes many products constructed of 100% polyester microfiber. Fabrics made with microfibers are exceptionally soft and hold their shape well. When high-quality microfiber {{is combined with}} the right knitting process, it creates an extremely effective cleaning material. This material can hold up to eight times its weight in water. Microfiber products have exceptional ability to absorb oils, and are not hard enough to scratch even paintwork unless they have retained grit or hard particles from previous use.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies on}} {{collagen}} fiber orientation {{have led to}} different interpretations and theories about the fiber arrangement in the lamellar compact bone. The purpose {{of this investigation was}} to provide new and more in-depth data on fiber arrangement in the lamellar bone system in order to explain the orientation of the fiber bundles. This was carried out by applying a simple method of preparation which permitted observation of non-decalcified samples. A previously isolated Haversian system was subjected to slow bending up to reaching the fracture point. Hence, the fracture surface was observed by SEM. The same samples were also observed by polarized light microscopy. A significant alternation of fiber orientation in the adjacent lamellae was observed. Different domains of differently oriented fibers were present within the same lamella; <b>conjugating</b> <b>fibers</b> connecting adjacent lamellae were also shown. This method avoided most of the artifacts due to chemical treatment of bone samples. The results can be easily interpreted by means of the same criteria applied in mechanics for the studying of composite materials...|$|R
40|$|Conjugated {{polymers}} {{are complex}} multi-chromophore systems, with emission properties strongly {{dependent on the}} electronic energy transfer through active sub-units. Although the packing of the conjugated chains in the solid state {{is known to be}} a key factor to tailor the electronic energy transfer and the resulting optical properties, most of the current solution-based processing methods do not allow for effectively controlling the molecular order, thus making the full unveiling of energy transfer mechanisms very complex. Here we report on <b>conjugated</b> polymer <b>fibers</b> with tailored internal molecular order, leading to a significant enhancement of the emission quantum yield. Steady state and femtosecond time-resolved polarized spectroscopies evidence that excitation is directed toward those chromophores oriented along the fiber axis, on a typical timescale of picoseconds. These aligned and more extended chromophores, resulting from the high stretching rate and electric field applied during the fiber spinning process, lead to improved emission properties. <b>Conjugated</b> polymer <b>fibers</b> are relevant to develop optoelectronic plastic devices with enhanced and anisotropic properties.

40|$|The authors {{report on}} the {{realization}} of ordered arrays of light-emitting conjugated polymer nanofibers by near-field electrospinning. The fibers, made by poly[2 -methoxy- 5 -(2 -ethylhexyloxy) - 1, 4 -phenylenevinylene], have diameters of few hundreds of nanometers and emission peaked at 560 nm. The observed blue-shift compared to the emission from reference films is attributed to different polymer packing in the nanostructures. Optical confinement in the fibers is also analyzed through self-waveguided emission. These results open interesting perspectives for realizing complex and ordered architectures by light-emitting nanofibers, such as photonic circuits, and for the precise positioning and integration of <b>conjugated</b> polymer <b>fibers</b> into light-emitting devices.

For this purpose, 40 mix plot including 4 series A and B and C and D, which contain, respectively, 0, 2, 4 and 6 % weight of cement, nano-silica particles were used {{as a substitute for}} cement.

40|$|We {{report the}} low {{temperature}} current-voltage (I-V) characteristics studies in quasi-one dimensional conducting polymer nanofibers. We find a threshold voltage Vt below which little current flows at temperatures below 30 - 40 K. For V > Vt current scales as (V/Vt - 1) ^zeta, where zeta ~ 1. 8 - 2. 1 at high biases. Differential conductance oscillations are found whose magnitude increases as temperature decreases below 10 K. We attribute the observed low temperature I-V behavior to Coulomb blockade effects with a crossover to Luttinger liquid-like behavior at high temperature. We demonstrate that at low temperatures such a doped <b>conjugated</b> polymer <b>fiber</b> {{can be considered}} as an array of small conducting regions separated by nanoscale barriers, where the Coulomb blockade tunneling is the dominant transport mechanism.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes new peptide-based {{methods for}} assembling and controlling the morphologies, metrics, and properties of gold nanoparticle superstructures. The {{aim of this}} research is to develop the peptide-based method by modifying the peptide sequences and controlling the reaction conditions for the synthesis and assembly of gold nanoparticle superstructures to achieve reliable control over their morphology and metrics, and furthermore study their properties and applications. With this goal in mind, the C-terminus of a gold-binding peptide was modified with different numbers of hydrophobic phenylalanines to affect peptide assembly and ultimately nanoparticle assembly. The addition of hydrophobic phenylalanines to the C-terminus of peptide <b>conjugates</b> promoted <b>fiber</b> bundling which in turn lead to the formation of thick or intertwined 1 -D nanoparticle superstructures. Furthermore, I prepared spherical gold nanoparticle superstructures with varied diameters (40 nm, 75 nm, and 150 nm) and visible to near-infrared optical properties by using a single peptide conjugate molecule yet varied reaction conditions. Theoretical simulation and experiment were coupled to further understand their optical properties. Finally, I studied and demonstrated the drug storage and release properties of hollow spherical gold nanoparticle superstructures; this was the first demonstrated application of this class of nanoparticle superstructure. ...|$|R

Characterization of modified hollow fibers {{with respect to their}} activation using ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether, conjugation with polysaccharides, and immobilization with Cibacron Blue 3 GA indicates that the surface modification was successfully achieved.

40|$|Abstract: Antioxidants are {{abundant}} compounds primarily found in {{fresh fruits and}} vegetables, and evidence for {{their role in the}} prevention of degenerative diseases is continuously emerging. However, the bioaccessibility and bioavailability of each compound differs greatly, and the most abundant antioxidants in ingested fruit are not necessarily those leading to the highest concentrations of active metabolites in target tissues. Fruit antioxidants are commonly mixed with different macromolecules such as carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins to form a food matrix. In fruits and vegetables, carbohydrates are the major compounds found, mainly in free and <b>conjugated</b> forms. Dietary <b>fiber,</b> the indigestible cell wall component of plant material, is considered {{to play an important role}} in human diet and health. Most studies on antioxidant bioavailability are focused on foods and beverages from which antioxidants are easily released. There is evidence indicating that food microstructure affects the bioaccessibility and bioavailability of several nutrients, referring mostly to antioxidants. Nevertheless, the specific role of dietary fiber in the absorption of antioxidants has not been widely discussed. In this context, the purpose of the present review is to compile and analyze evidence relating to the association between dietary fiber and antioxidants, and the physical and chemical interactions that modulate their release from the chyme in the gastrointestinal tract...|$|R
