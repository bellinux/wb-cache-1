40|$|In {{previous}} studies, migraine patients showed abnormalities in pain-related evoked responses, as reduced habituation to repetitive stimulation. In this study, we {{aimed to}} apply a novel analysis of EEG bands synchronization and directed dynamical influences under painful stimuli <b>in</b> migraine patients <b>compared</b> to non-migraine healthy volunteers. Thirty-one migraine without aura outpatients (MIGR) were evaluated and compared to 19 controls (CONT). The right hand was stimulated by means of 30 consecutive CO 2 laser stimuli. EEG signal was examined by means of Morlet wavelet, synchronization entropy (SE), and Granger causality (GC), and the statistically validated results were mapped on the corresponding scalp locations. The vertex complex of averaged laser-evoked responses (LEPs) showed reduced habituation <b>compared</b> to <b>CONT.</b> <b>In</b> the prestimulus phase, enhanced SE in the 0, 5 - 30 Hz range was present <b>in</b> MIGR and <b>CONT</b> between the bilateral temporal-parietal and the frontal regions around the midline. Migraine patients showed an anticipation of EEG changes preceding the painful stimulation <b>compared</b> to <b>CONT.</b> <b>In</b> the poststimulus phase, the same cortical areas were more connected <b>in</b> MIGR vs <b>CONT.</b> <b>In</b> both groups of patients and CONT, the habituation index was negatively correlated with the GC scores. A different pattern of cortical activation after painful stimulation was present in migraine. The increase in cortical connections during repetitive painful stimulation may subtend the phenomenon of LEPs reduced habituation. Brain network analysis may give an aid in understanding subtle changes of pain processing under laser stimuli in migraine patients...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To study {{white matter}} (WM) {{development}} in youth at high familial risk for bipolar disorder (BD). WM alterations {{are reported in}} youth and adults with BD. WM undergoes important maturational changes in adolescence. Age-related changes in WM microstructure using diffusion tensor imaging with tract-based spatial statistics in healthy offspring having a parent with BD were <b>compared</b> with those <b>in</b> healthy controls. METHOD: A total of 45 offspring participated, including 20 healthy offspring with a parent diagnosed with BD (HBO) and 25 healthy control offspring of healthy parents (CONT). All were free of medical and psychiatric disorders. Mean fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD), and longitudinal diffusivity were examined using whole-brain analyses, co-varying for age. RESULTS: Group-by-age interactions showed a linear increase in FA and a linear decrease <b>in</b> RD <b>in</b> <b>CONT</b> <b>in</b> the left corpus callosum and right inferior longitudinal fasciculus. In HBO, there was a linear decrease in FA {{and an increase in}} RD with age in the left corpus callosum and no relation between FA or RD and age in the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Curve fitting confirmed linear and showed nonlinear relations between FA and RD and age in these regions <b>in</b> <b>CONT</b> and HBO. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to examine WM in healthy offspring at high familial risk for BD. Results from this cross-sectional study suggest altered development of WM <b>in</b> HBO <b>compared</b> with <b>CONT</b> <b>in</b> the corpus callosum and temporal associative tracts, which may represent vulnerability markers for future BD and other psychiatric disorders in HBO...|$|R

All heifers were placed on a high-energy diet on Day 0 at which time they received no additional treatment (CONT), were ovariectomized (OVX) or were ovariectomized and subcutaneously implanted with estradiol- 17 β (OVX-E 2). This feeding regimen was used to synchronize reproductive state in all heifers. A second experiment was performed with 16 prepubertal heifers using the same treatments at 266 days (Day 0) of age (CONT, OVX and OVX-E 2) but no dietary intake manipulation.

Delayed treatment with Pio partially restored podocyte staining and tended to decrease the ratio of proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive to apoptotic cells in glomeruli. Both treatment groups showed significantly reduced infiltrating glomerular macrophages and plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 mRNA expression in cortex, with no change in transforming growth factor-β 1 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase- 1 mRNA. Pio also decreased renal cortical angiopoietin-like protein 4 expression to almost 20 % of CONT group, associated with increased vascular endothelial-derived growth factor expression in glomeruli. We conclude that treatment with PPARγ agonist has protective effects on progression of glomerulosclerosis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} were to determine the level of oxidative stress in atrophied gastrocnemius, and to verify the effect of molecular hydrogen (H 2) saturated alkaline electrolyzed water (HSW) on gastrocnemius atrophy by modifying the redox status, indicated by 8 -hydroxy- 2 -deoxyguanosine (8 -OHdG), malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) -like activity. Female Wistar rats were divided into four groups: (1) the control (CONT); (2) the Hindlimb unloading (HU, for 3 weeks) given purified normal water (HU-NW); (3) the HU given alkaline electrolyzed reduced water (HU-AEW); and (4) the HU given HSW (HU-HSW). We showed that 8 -OHdG, but not MDA, significantly increased by 149 % and 145 % in HU-NW and HU-AEW, respectively, when <b>compared</b> with <b>CONT.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, there was a trend toward suppression in 8 -OHdG levels (increased by 95 % compared with CONT) by treatment of HSW, though this effect was not prominent. Additionally, SOD-like activity significantly increased in both HU-NW (184 %) and HU-AEW (199 %) when compared with CONT. This result suggests the elevation of O 2 ˙ in the atrophied gastrocnemius. However, upregulation of SOD-like activity in the HU-HSW was increased by only 169 % compared with CONT, though this difference {{is too small to}} detect statistical significance. HU led to 13 % and 15 % reduction of gastrocnemius wet weights in HU-NW and HU-AEW, respectively, compared with CONT. And the reduction of gastrocnemius wet weights in HU-HSW was attenuated by 7 % compared with CONT. The gastrocnemius wet weights in the HU-HSW group were significantly greater than those in the HU-AEW, but not statistically significant with HU-NW. These results indicate that HU causes an increase in oxidative stress, but, in this experimental protocol, continuous consumption of HSW during HU does not demonstrate successful attenuation of oxidative stress and HU-mediated gastrocnemius atrophy. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose We {{determined}} {{the effect of}} reduced muscle glycogen availability on cellular pathways regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and substrate utilization after a bout of resistance exercise. Methods Eight young, recreationally trained men undertook a glycogen depletion protocol of one-leg cycling to fatigue (LOW), while the contralateral (control) leg rested (CONT). Following an overnight fast, subjects completed 8 sets of 5 unilateral leg press repetitions (REX) at 80 % 1 Repetition Maximum (1 RM) on each leg. Subjects consumed 500 mL protein/CHO beverage (20 g whey + 40 g maltodextrin) upon completion of REX and 2 h later. Muscle biopsies were obtained at rest and 1 and 4 h after REX in both legs. Results Resting muscle glycogen was higher <b>in</b> the <b>CONT</b> than LOW leg (~ 384 ± 114 vs 184 ± 36 mmol kg− 1 dry wt; P < 0. 05), and 1 h and 4 h post-exercise (P < 0. 05). Phosphorylation of p 53 Ser 15 increased 1 h post-exercise in LOW (~ 115 %, P < 0. 05) and was higher than CONT at this time point (~ 87 %, P < 0. 05). p 38 MAPKThr 180 /Tyr 182 phosphorylation increased 1 h post-exercise <b>in</b> both <b>CONT</b> and LOW (~ 800 - 900 %; P < 0. 05) but remained above rest at 4 h only <b>in</b> <b>CONT</b> (~ 585 %, P < 0. 05; different between legs P < 0. 05). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator- 1 α (PGC- 1 α) mRNA was elevated 4 h post-exercise in LOW (~ 200 %, P < 0. 05; different between legs P < 0. 05). There were no changes in Fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC 5) mRNA for CONT or LOW legs post-exercise. Conclusion Undertaking resistance exercise with low glycogen availability may enhance mitochondrial-related adaptations through p 53 and PGC- 1 α-mediated signalling...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the influence of}} prior exercise designed to reduce predominantly muscle glycogen in either type I or II fibers on pacing and performance during a 4 -km cycling time trial (TT). After preliminary and familiarization trials, in a randomized, repeated-measures crossover design, ten amateur cyclists performed: 1) an exercise designed to reduce glycogen of type I muscle fibers, followed by a 4 -km TT (EX-FIB I); 2) an exercise designed to reduce glycogen of type II muscle fibers, followed by a 4 -km TT (EX-FIB II) and; 3) a 4 -km TT, without the prior exercise (CONT). The muscle-glycogen-reducing exercise in both EX-FIB I and EX-FIB II was performed in the evening,, 12 h before the 4 -km TT. Performance time was increased and power output (PO) was reduced in EX-FIB I (432. 868. 3 s and 204. 9610. 9 W) and EX-FIB II (428. 766. 7 s and 207. 569. 1 W) compared to CONT (420. 866. 4 s and 218. 469. 3 W; P, 0. 01), without a difference between EX-FIB I and EX-FIB II (P. 0. 05). The PO was lower in EX-FIB I than <b>in</b> <b>CONT</b> {{at the beginning and}} middle of the trial (P, 0. 05). The mean aerobic contribution during EX-FIB I was also significantly lower than <b>in</b> <b>CONT</b> (P, 0. 05), but {{there was no difference between}} CONT and EX-FIB II or between EX-FIB I and EX-FIB II (P. 0. 05). The integrated electromyography was unchanged between conditions (P. 0. 05). Performance may have been impaired in EX-FIB I due a more conservative pacing at the beginning and middle, which was associated with a reduced aerobic contribution. In turn, the PO profile adopted in EX-FIB II was also reduced throughout th...|$|R
