5|$|Beagles are {{intelligent}} but, as {{a result}} of being bred for the long chase, are single-minded and determined, which <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> hard to train. They can be difficult to recall once they have picked up a scent, and are easily distracted by smells around them. They do not generally feature in obedience trials; while they are alert, respond well to food-reward training, and are eager to please, they are easily bored or distracted. They are ranked 72nd in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, as Coren places them among the group with the lowest degree of working/obedience intelligence. Coren's scale, however, does not assess understanding, independence, or creativity.|$|E
5|$|The player {{controls}} the protagonist Leon S. Kennedy from a third-person perspective. The gameplay focuses on action and shootouts involving crowds of enemies in large open areas but still features some Horror elements. The camera is placed behind Leon and zooms {{in for an}} over-the-shoulder view when aiming a weapon, or a first-person view when aiming with a sniper rifle. There is no crosshair for firearms, instead, every firearm has a laser sight. Unlike previous games where players can only shoot straight, up or down, players have more options. For example, shots to the feet can cause enemies to stumble, shots to the arms <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> drop their weapons, and headshots instantly kill most human enemies. Players can shoot down projectiles like thrown axes or scythes.|$|E

25|$|Charlotte can {{manipulate}} fiends very easily. It {{has been shown}} in many episodes that giving fiends sugar of any kind, or sometimes even just showing them affection, <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> turn benevolent. It is unknown whether this is a flaw present in all fiends, a mistake Vendetta repeats by accident, or some unspoken power of Charlotte's.|$|E
25|$|Since the Vocaloid or its vocal {{library is}} {{released}} for producers {{to do as}} they please, some producers think of the Vocaloids as dolls and that they <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> sing whatever they want. The portrayals of Vocaloids can at times touch controversial issues. Releases put out as young children risk becoming subject to sexual or pedophilic portrayals.|$|E
25|$|Aerogels by {{themselves}} are hydrophilic, but chemical treatment <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> hydrophobic. If they absorb moisture they usually suffer a structural change, such as contraction, and deteriorate, but degradation {{can be prevented}} by making them hydrophobic. Aerogels with hydrophobic interiors are less susceptible to degradation than aerogels with only an outer hydrophobic layer, even if a crack penetrates the surface.|$|E

25|$|Filler metal (electrode material) {{improperly}} {{chosen for}} the environmental conditions <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> corrosion-sensitive as well. There are also issues of galvanic corrosion if the electrode composition is sufficiently dissimilar to the materials welded, or the materials are dissimilar themselves. Even between different grades of nickel-based stainless steels, corrosion of welded joints can be severe, despite that they rarely undergo galvanic corrosion when mechanically joined.|$|E
25|$|All tea plant tissues {{accumulate}} fluorine to some extent. Tea bricks {{that are}} made from old tea leaves and stems can accumulate large amounts of this element, which <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> unsafe for consumption in large quantities or over prolonged periods. Use of such teas has led to fluorosis, a form of fluoride poisoning that affects the bones and teeth, in areas of high brick tea consumption such as Tibet.|$|E
25|$|Air {{conditioning}} and heating in buildings and motor vehicles {{are two of}} the largest applications for heat exchangers. While copper tube is used in most air {{conditioning and}} refrigeration systems, typical air conditioning units currently use aluminium fins. These systems can harbor bacteria and mold and develop odors and fouling that <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> function poorly. Stringent new requirements including demands for increased operating efficiencies and the reduction or elimination of harmful emissions are enhancing copper's role in modern HVAC systems.|$|E

25|$|In Dragonlance Adventures, the kender are {{depicted}} with several qualities {{that make them}} stand out. They obtain a wizened appearance as they grow older, due to a fine network of lines that appears on their faces around age forty, and have pointed ears which gives them somewhat of a resemblance to elves. Kender {{tend to have a}} wide vocal range, enabling older individuals to perform impressive sound imitations. In addition, they are often depicted as rambling and speaking very quickly when excited, which <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> difficult to understand. Finally, they are described as having a distinctive topknot incorporated into their hairstyles, which is a source of pride.|$|E
25|$|Commonly, {{heterosexual}} men reject {{the idea of}} being receptive partners during anal sex because they believe it is a feminine act, <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> vulnerable, or contradicts their sexual orientation (for example, that it is indicative that they are gay). The BMJ stated in 1999, however:There are little published data on how many {{heterosexual men}} would like their anus to be sexually stimulated in a heterosexual relationship. Anecdotally, it is a substantial number. What data we do have almost all relate to penetrative sexual acts, and the superficial contact of the anal ring with fingers or the tongue is even less well documented but may be assumed to be a common sexual activity for men of all sexual orientations.|$|E
25|$|People {{choose to}} wear contact lenses for many reasons. Aesthetics and {{cosmetics}} {{are the main}} motivating factors {{for people who want}} to avoid wearing glasses or to change the appearance of their eyes. Others wear contact lenses for functional or optical reasons. When compared with spectacles, contact lenses typically provide better peripheral vision, and do not collect moisture (from rain, snow, condensation etc.) or perspiration. This <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> preferable for sports and other outdoor activities. Contact lens wearers can also wear sunglasses, goggles, or other eyewear of their choice without having to fit them with prescription lenses or worry about compatibility with glasses. Additionally, there are conditions such as keratoconus and aniseikonia that are typically corrected better with contact lenses than with glasses.|$|E

25|$|Spit testing with {{an intact}} male is {{generally}} free {{and is usually}} accurate. However, some hormonal conditions in females <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> reject a male {{when they are in}} fact not pregnant, and, more rarely, accept a male when they are pregnant. Progesterone tests can give a high reading in some females with a hormonal problem that are in fact not pregnant. Neither of the previous methods, nor palpation, can give a reasonably accurate idea of the age of the fetus, while an ultrasound procedure can. In addition, an ultrasound procedure can distinguish between pregnancy and misleading physical conditions, or between a live and dead fetus. The disadvantages of an ultrasound procedure are cost, some training in the use of ultrasound equipment is required, and not all veterinarians have the equipment needed to perform the examination.|$|E
25|$|Maintenance {{requires}} sufficient servers and bandwidth, and {{a dedicated}} support staff. Insufficient resources for maintenance lead to lag and frustration for the players, and can severely damage {{the reputation of}} a game, especially at launch. Care {{must also be taken}} to ensure that player population remains at an acceptable level by adding or removing servers. Peer-to-peer MMORPGs could theoretically work cheaply and efficiently in regulating server load, but practical issues such as asymmetrical network bandwidth, CPU-hungry rendering engines, unreliability of individual nodes, and inherent lack of security (opening fertile new grounds for cheating) <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> a difficult proposition. The hosted infrastructure for a commercial-grade MMORPG requires the deployment of hundreds (or even thousands) of servers. Developing an affordable infrastructure for an online game requires developers to scale large numbers of players with less hardware and network investment.|$|E
25|$|The borzoi is a quiet, but {{athletic}} and independent dog. Most borzois are almost silent, barking only very rarely. They {{do not have}} strong territorial drives and cannot be relied on to raise the alarm upon sighting a human intruder. The borzoi is extremely smart and requires patient, experienced handling. They are gentle and highly sensitive dogs with a natural respect for humans, and as adults they are decorative couch potatoes with remarkably gracious house manners. Borzois do not generally display dominance or aggression towards people, but will turn aggressive if handled roughly. Typically however, they are rather reserved with strangers but affectionate with people they know well. Their sensitivity to invasion of their personal space <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> nervous around children unless they are brought up with them. Despite their size, borzois adapt very well to suburban life, provided they have a spacious yard and regular opportunities for free exercise.|$|E

If a whole crew came talking, parties would listen; but if it's only one lone old shell-back, it's the usual yarn. And at least, they needn't talk before six months, or--if we have luck, and there's a whaler handy--three years. And by that time, Mr. Dodd, it's ancient history." ...|$|R

25|$|Kittens {{require a}} high-calorie diet that {{contains}} more protein than the diet of adult cats. Young orphaned kittens require cat milk {{every two to}} four hours, and they need physical stimulation to defecate and urinate. Cat milk replacement is manufactured to feed to young kittens, because cow's milk does not provide all the necessary nutrients. Human-reared kittens {{tend to be very}} affectionate with humans as adults and sometimes more dependent on them than kittens reared by their mothers, but they can also show volatile mood swings and aggression. Depending on the age at which they were orphaned and how long they were without their mothers, these kittens may be severely underweight and can have health problems later in life, such as heart conditions. The compromised immune system of orphaned kittens (from lack of antibodies found naturally in the mother's milk) <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> especially susceptible to infections, making antibiotics a necessity.|$|E
25|$|Coal is {{the most}} {{abundant}} fossil fuel on the planet, and widely used {{as the source of}} energy in thermal power stations. It is a relatively cheap fuel, with some of the largest deposits in regions that are stable politically, such as China, India and the United States. This contrasts with natural gas, the largest deposits of which are located in Russia, Iran, Qatar, Turkmenistan and the US. Solid coal cannot directly replace natural gas or petroleum in most applications, petroleum is mostly used for transportation and the natural gas not used for electricity generation is used for space, water and industrial heating. Coal can be converted to gas or liquid fuel, but the efficiencies and economics of such processes <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> unfeasible. Vehicles or heaters may require modification to use coal-derived fuels. Coal is an impure fuel and produces more greenhouse gas and pollution than an equivalent amount of petroleum or natural gas. For instance, the operation of a 1000-MWe coal-fired power plant results in a nuclear radiation dose of 490 person-rem/year, compared to 136 person-rem/year, for an equivalent nuclear power plant including uranium mining, reactor operation and waste disposal.|$|E
