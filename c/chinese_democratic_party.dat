This trip was due to the support of Xu Shiying, a high-ranking Nationalist politician who held Zhang in high regard. After arriving in Germany Zhang joined the Communist Party of China (CPC) after becoming friends with Zhu De (Field Marshal and Supreme Military Commander of the New China), his roommate at the time. Zhang left the CPC following the doom of the “August First” military uprising at Nanchang in 1927, and over the years, in collaboration with others, founded the so-called [...] "third parties", known today as the <b>Chinese</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> of Peasants and Workers, and the China Democratic League.

50|$|Ju co-founded the <b>Democratic</b> Progressive <b>Party</b> in 1986, and was {{responsible}} for writing the party charter. He {{was elected to the}} Legislative Yuan {{for the first time that}} year. Shortly after taking office, Ju gained the nickname Rambo for his combative personality, which frequently led to him physically fighting other lawmakers. Ju ran for election in 1989 without the support of the <b>Democratic</b> Progressive <b>Party,</b> and managed to retain his legislative seat. For mounting an independent campaign, Ju was expelled from the DPP in February 1990 and founded the <b>Chinese</b> Social <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> in 1991. He contested the 1992 legislative elections as a CSDP candidate, which he won. As the only member of his party, Ju chose to caucus with the New Party. By 1993, Ju had again decided to switch affiliations. Though he briefly considered joining the Kuomintang, he was named the New Party candidate for governor of Taiwan Province in August 1994. As a result, Ju consolidated the CSDP with the New Party on 28 December 1994. He lost the gubernatorial election to incumbent James Soong, but subsequently was reelected to parliament as a member of the New Party in 1995.

Tan considered taking the party out of the Alliance but decided against it.

Other initiatives included the Chinese Unity Movement and the Perak Task Force to help built support in New Villages in Perak.

Of the 33 parliamentary seats contested, MCA managed to retain only 13. MCA also {{lost control of}} the Penang State Government to Gerakan. The gain by the opposition parties led to tension between different communities which erupted into the May 13 Riots. Prior to the riots, on 12 May 1969, Tan Siew Sin announced that the party would withdraw from the Alliance, but reconsidered on 20 May and joined the National Operations Council formed in place of the suspended Parliament after the riots. [...] The loss of support for MCA among the Chinese population elicited a comment by the then Deputy Prime Minister Dr Ismail that if MCA continue to lose support, UMNO may stop co-operating with it. In order to regain Chinese support, Tan attempted to broaden the appeal of the party previously seen as a party of the taukeh (tou jia, rich men), and invited professionals to join the party. [...] However, many of these were expelled after a dispute involving Lim Keng Yaik who then joined Gerakan.|$|R
25|$|On 13 May 1969, a {{few days}} after the 10 May general election, a race riot broke out. In the {{preceding}} election, <b>parties</b> like the <b>Democratic</b> Action <b>Party</b> (DAP, formerly the Malaysian branch of the PAP) and Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia, which opposed special Bumiputra privileges, had made substantial gains, coming close to defeating the Alliance and forming a new government. The largely <b>Chinese</b> opposition <b>Democratic</b> Action <b>Party</b> and Gerakan later secured a police permit for a victory parade through a fixed route in Kuala Lumpur, the capital city of Malaysia. However, the rowdy procession deviated from its route and headed through the Malay district of Kampung Baru, jeering at the inhabitants. While the Gerakan party issued an apology the next day, UMNO announced a counter-procession starting from the head of Selangor state Dato' Harun bin Idris on Jalan Raja Muda. Reportedly, the gathering crowd was informed that Malays on their way to the procession had been attacked by Chinese in Setapak, several miles to the north. The angry protestors swiftly wreaked revenge by killing two passing Chinese motorcyclists, and the riot began. The official death toll was approximately 200, although some would later estimate it to be as high as 2000. The riot was later attributed to the underlying discontent among Malays due to poverty.|$|R
