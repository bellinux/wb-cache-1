40|$|Over {{the last}} two years, serious {{concerns}} have been expressed in the press about human exposures to trace amounts of alkyl tin moieties such as tributyltin (TBT). Organostannic compounds are commonly used as catalysts in polyurethane chemistry. Whereas stannous octoate (SNOCT) exhibits a TBT content below the detection limit of most analysis equipment (< 0. 01 %, TBT levels as high as 0. 6 % have been measured in dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTDL). Although DBTDL manufacturers are currently optimising their process to lower the TBT content in DBTDL, the (chemo) pressure exerted on polyurethane foamers is such that DBTDL-free formulations are being actively looked for. High resilience (HR) foams based on various polymer polyols - particularly polyols made with pure polystyrene (POSTech*) or poly(styrene-acrylonitrile) have been developed using DBTDL as the gel catalyst. The direct replacement of DBTDL is not straightforward, as foam block dimensional stability issues (often referred to as "cold flow") are encountered when other catalyst (i. e., SNOCT) are used. This "cold flow" phenomenon is very much dependent on the size {{and the weight of}} the foam block produced, making all small scale laboratory experiments unsuitable for developing novel stable HR foam formulations. The present research has shown that properties derived from small scale experiments can nevertheless be related to the "cold flowability" of HR formulations. Amongst the various tests investigated, the variation in sag factor from top to bottom of the foam block was found to be the most relevant test method to assess the dimensional stability. Sag factor is here defined as the force exerted by the foam compressed to 65 % of the original thickness divided by that exerted at 25 % compression during the <b>compression</b> <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> (CLD) test. The test method based on this variation in sag factor through the foam block (vSag) made possible the laboratory examination of formulation parameters for their impact on foam block stability. It also allowed us to develop a wide density range of POSTech-based DBTDL-free HR slabstock foams that are dimensionally stable...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{imbedded}} delaminations on the compression fatigue behavior of quasi-isotropic, T 300 / 5208, graphite/epoxy laminates was investigated. Teflon imbedments were introduced during panel layup to create delaminations. Static and constant amplitude (R= 10, omega = 10 Hz) fatigue tests were conducted. S-N data and half life residual strength data were obtained. During static <b>compression</b> <b>loading,</b> the maximum <b>deflection</b> of the buckled delaminated region was recorded. Under compression fatigue, {{growth of the}} imbedded delamination was identified as the predominant failure mode {{in most of the}} test cases. Specimens that exhibited others failures had a single low stiffness ply above the Teflon imbedment. Delamination growth during fatigue was monitored using DIB enhanced radiography. In specimens with buried delaminations, the dye penetrant (DIB) was introduced into the delaminated region through a minute laser drilled hole, using a hypodermic needle. A low kV, microfocus, X-ray unit was mounted near the test equipment to efficiently record the cyclic growth of buried delaminations on Polaroid film...|$|R

40|$|Several major {{types of}} civil {{engineering}} structure including off-shore platforms and road and railway bridges are subjected to repeated loading. Earlier {{studies have indicated that}} such <b>loading</b> causes higher <b>deflections</b> in concrete structures than static loading. This thesis is devoted {{to the study of the}} deflection behaviour of reinforced and partially prestressed concrete box beams. In addition to presenting details and results of a comprehensive experimental programme, a simple and reliable procedure is proposed for the analysis of concrete beam <b>deflections</b> under repeated <b>loading.</b> Thirty reinforced and five partially prestressed concrete box beams (of 1 / 4 scale) were fabricated and each tested up to 105 repetitions of load. For each beam, the repeated loading range was kept constant with the lower and upper limits set at 30 percent and 50 percent of the yield load to simulate the dead load and service load respectively. For some beams 70 percent or 90 percent of the yield load was used as the upper limit, simulating overloading conditions. The <b>deflections</b> at both <b>loading</b> limits were measured immediately after 1, 10, 102, 103, 104 and 105 cycles of load. It was found that after the initial loading cycle the bending rigidity of the beams (hence the instantaneous deflection) was not affected by further repeated loading. The dead <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> on the other hand increased with increasing number of loading cycles although the rate of increase reduced rapidly as the number of cycles became larger. This amplification of dead <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> by repeated <b>load</b> can be seen as a parallel phenomenon to the time creep of concrete under sustained <b>loads.</b> Because large <b>deflection</b> can accumulate in a short time under repeated <b>loads,</b> the accumulated <b>deflection</b> is referred to herein as the 2 ̆ 7 intensive creep 2 ̆ 7 deflection. For some lightly reinforced beams the intensive creep deflection was as high as eight times the initial dead <b>load</b> <b>deflection.</b> The steel ratio, degree of prestressing and the maximum loading level are found to be the important factors influencing the deflection behaviour of concrete beams under repeated loading. A simple procedure is presented for the analysis of the total deflections of reinforced and prestressed concrete box beams under repeated <b>loading.</b> The total <b>deflection</b> is obtained by summing the instantaneous live <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> and the accumulated dead <b>load</b> <b>deflection.</b> The latter may be computed as the product of the initial dead <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> and the intensive creep factor. Following a comparative study, the most suitable method is chosen from 9 well-known procedures for the computation of initial dead <b>load</b> <b>deflection.</b> Based on the experimental data of the initial and accumulated dead <b>load</b> <b>deflections</b> an empirical formula for the intensive creep factor is derived using statistical means. Parallel to the logarithmic time-creep equation, the formula is considered to be more realistic than an alternative hyperbolic model. For computing the instantaneous live <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> of any <b>loading</b> cycle, a new equation for the effective moment of inertia is proposed. This equation is shown to be superior to the existing formulas. All equations recommended for use are simple and explicit. In light of the experimental data obtained herein and those by other researchers, comparisons are made with two other recently published methods. It is concluded that the proposed procedure is more versatile in that it accounts for more variables and allows for the predictions of instantaneous deflection and permanent set in addition to the total deflection. In most cases it also gives more accurate results...|$|R

The {{spindle shaft}} of heavy <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> angle milling head is an {{important}} functional component of 5 -axis CNC machine tool, which has characteristics of high torque and high power, used for large and complex free-form surface processing.

40|$|Background: One of {{the methods}} used for joining metals {{together}} is welding, which can be carried out using different techniques such as electric spot welding. This study evaluated the effect of electric spot welding on the <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> rate of stainless steel and chromium-cobalt orthodontic wires. Materials and Methods: In this experimental-laboratory study, <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> rate of 0. 016 × 0. 022 inch stainless steel and chromium cobalt wires were evaluated in five groups (n = 18) : group one: Stainless steel wires, group two: chromium-cobalt wires, group three: stainless steel wires welded to stainless steel wires, group four: Stainless steel wires welded to chromium-cobalt wires, group five: chromium-cobalt wire welded to chromium-cobalt wires. Afterward, the forces induced by the samples in 0. 5 mm, 1 mm, 1. 5 mm deflection were measured using a universal testing machine. Then mean force measured for each group was compared with other groups. The data were analyzed using repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA), one-way ANOVA, and paired t-test by the SPSS software. The significance level was set as 0. 05. Results: The Tukey test showed that there were significant differences between the <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> rates of welded groups compared to control ones (P < 0. 001).

40|$|The {{increasing}} use {{of fiber}} reinforced plastic (FRP) bars to reinforce concrete structures necessitates the need for either developing a new design code or adopt the current one {{to account for the}} engineering characteristics of FRP materials. This paper suggests some modifications to the currently used ACI model for computing flexural strength, service <b>load</b> <b>deflection,</b> and the minimum reinforcement needed to avoid rupturing of the tensile reinforcement so as to use them when reinforcement is provided by Glass FRP (GFRP) bars. Two series of tests were carried out to check the validity of the suggested modifications. The first series was used to check the validity of the modifications made into the flexural and service <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> models. The test results of the first series were also analyzed to develop two simple models for computing the service <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> for beams reinforced with GFRP bars. The second series was used to check the accuracy of the modification suggested into minimum reinforcement model. Test results of the first series indicate that the flexural capacity of the beams reinforced by GFRP bars can be accurately predicted using the ultimate design theory. They also show that the current ACI model for computing the service <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> underestimates the actual deflection of these beams. The two suggested models for service <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> accurately estimated the measured <b>deflection</b> under service <b>load,</b> and the simplest of the two pertains better predictions than those of the models available in the literature. Test results of the second series reveal that there is an excellent agreement between the predicted and recorded behavior of the test specimens, which suggests the validity of the proposed model for calculating the required minimum reinforcement for beams reinforced by GFRP bars...|$|R
