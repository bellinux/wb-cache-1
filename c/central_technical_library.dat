40|$|Discourses that {{celebrate}} the knowledge economy accentuate its novelty {{at the expense}} of historical assessments of the role information has played in economic development. In the early twentieth century formal recognition was given to the importance of knowledge as a prime factor of production by firms that established the first in-house <b>technical</b> <b>library</b> in Britain. This paper reports on funded research undertaken at Leeds Metropolitan University on the “early information society in Britain. ” Part of this research project focuses on the emergence of information management—including systems for the storage and retrieval of technical information—in large-scale enterprises before the age of the computer. An empirical study is offered of in-house <b>technical</b> <b>libraries</b> before approximately 1950, followed by an analysis of the contexts that drove their development. It is suggested, in conclusion, that such libraries contributed significantly to the information management revolution of the early twentieth century. <b>Technical</b> <b>libraries</b> in British industrial and commercial enterprises before the middle of the twentieth century are a class of library relatively hidden from history. Although a fairly extensive literature exists on company <b>technical</b> <b>libraries</b> after 1950, much less is known about such libraries before this date. 1 As both special librarianship and information work became more important after World War II, practitioners in these fields, including the realm of the company <b>technical</b> <b>library,</b> began to publicize much more widely—in handbooks and guides and in the library press—the organization...|$|R
