The instrument takes pictures [...] wide and has enough internal memory to store an image [...] long before loading it into the main computer. The camera was built, and is operated by Malin Space Science Systems. CTX mapped 50% of Mars by February 2010.

2500|$|The <b>Cassegrain</b> <b>telescope</b> of the UVS had a [...] {{aperture}} {{and collected}} {{light from the}} observation target. Both the UVS and EUV instruments used a ruled grating to disperse this light for spectral analysis. This light then passed through an exit slit into photomultiplier tubes that produced pulses or [...] "sprays" [...] of electrons. These electron pulses were counted, and these count numbers constituted the data that were sent to Earth. The UVS was mounted on Galileo scan platform and could be pointed to an object in inertial space. The EUV was mounted on the spun section. As Galileo rotated, EUV observed a narrow ribbon of space perpendicular to the spin axis. The two instruments combined weighed about [...] and used 5.9 watts of power.|$|E
2500|$|The ALADIN instrument, {{essentially}} a direct detection lidar, {{consists of three}} major elements: a transmitter, a combined Mie and Rayleigh backscattering receiver assembly, and a <b>Cassegrain</b> <b>telescope</b> with a [...] diameter. The transmitter architecture {{is based on a}} 150 mJ diode-pumped frequency-tripled [...] operating in the ultraviolet at 355nm. The Mie receiver consists of a Fizeau spectrometer with a resolution of 100MHz (equivalent to 18m/s). The received backscatter signal produces a linear fringe whose position is directly linked to the wind velocity; the wind speed is determined by the fringe centroid position to better than a tenth of the resolution (1.8m/s). The Raleigh receiver employs a dual-filter Fabry–Pérot interferometer with a 2GHz resolution and 5GHz spacing. It analyzes the wings of the Rayleigh spectrum with a CCD; the etalon is split into two zones, which are imaged separately on the detector.|$|E

2500|$|The SSI was an 800-by-800-pixel {{solid state}} camera {{consisting}} of an array of silicon sensors called a charge-coupled device (CCD). Galileo {{was one of the}} first spacecraft to be equipped with a CCD camera. [...] The optical portion of the camera was built as a <b>Cassegrain</b> <b>telescope.</b> Light was collected by the primary mirror and directed to a smaller secondary mirror that channeled it through a hole in the center of the primary mirror and onto the CCD. The CCD sensor was shielded from radiation, a particular problem within the harsh Jovian magnetosphere. The shielding was accomplished by means of a [...] thick layer of tantalum surrounding the CCD except where the light enters the system. An eight-position filter wheel was used to obtain images at specific wavelengths. The images were then combined electronically on Earth to produce color images. The spectral response of the SSI ranged from about 0.4 to 1.1micrometres. The SSI weighed [...] and consumed, on average, 15 watts of power.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1992, during Galileo second gravity-assist {{planetary}} flyby of Earth, another groundbreaking {{experiment was}} performed. Optical communications in space {{was assessed by}} detecting light pulses from powerful lasers with Galileo CCD. The experiment, dubbed Galileo Optical Experiment or GOPEX, used two separate sites to beam laser pulses to the spacecraft, one at Table Mountain Observatory in California and the other at the Starfire Optical Range in New Mexico. The Table Mountain site used a frequency doubled Neodymium-Yttrium-Aluminium garnet (...) laser operating at 532nm with a repetition rate of ~15 to 30Hz and a pulse power (FWHM) {{in the tens of}} megawatts range, which was coupled to a [...] <b>Cassegrain</b> <b>telescope</b> for transmission to Galileo. The Starfire range site used a similar setup with a larger, , transmitting telescope. Long exposure (~0.1 to 0.8s) images using Galileo 560nm centered green filter produced images of Earth clearly showing the laser pulses even at distances of up to [...] Adverse weather conditions, restrictions placed on laser transmissions by the U.S. Space Defense Operations Center (SPADOC) and a pointing error caused by the scan platform acceleration on the spacecraft being slower than expected (which prevented laser detection on all frames with less than 400ms exposure times) all contributed to the reduction of the number of successful detections of the laser transmission to 48 of the total 159 frames taken. Nonetheless, the experiment was considered a resounding success and the data acquired will likely be used in the future to design laser [...] "downlinks" [...] which will send large volumes of data very quickly from spacecraft to Earth. The scheme is already being studied (as of 2004) for a data link to a future Mars orbiting spacecraft.|$|E

40|$|High-resolution {{images of}} the sun in the soft-X-ray/XUV range have been {{obtained}} with normal-incidence multilayer coated optics (MCOs) during a sounding-rocket flight on October 23, 1987 from White Sands. MCOs were used in two <b>Cassegrain</b> <b>telescopes,</b> as off-axis primary mirrors, and as tertiary mirrors operating with a Wolter-Schwarzschild (WS) grazing-incidence mirror. The inherent energy-selective property of MCOs allowed distinct groups of emission lines to be isolated in the solar corona and the transition region.

40|$|Two {{techniques}} {{have been proposed}} {{to increase the efficiency}} of coupling of light from lasers to <b>Cassegrain</b> <b>telescopes</b> and, in general, telescopes with secondary or tertiary mirror obscuration. The need to increase the efficiency of coupling arises in laser transmitters of lidar and freespace optical communication systems that utilize <b>Cassegrain</b> <b>telescopes.</b> The vignetting caused by the secondary reflector and baffle in such a telescope reduces the transmitted power by a large fraction because (1) the obscured area is central and is a significant fraction of the telescope aperture and (2) the cross-sectional intensity profile of a typical laser beam is Gaussian, so that intensity is greatest in the obscured central area. In a technique proposed previously for increasing the efficiency of coupling, an optical assembly comprising an axicon device and a folding mirror that would render the solid laser beam annular - in effect, turning the laser beam inside out - so that the laser light would be concentrated into an annular cross section that would not be obscured by the secondary reflector and baffle. Hence, most or all of the light would be coupled into the output beam. Another prior efficiency-enhancing technique is denoted subaperture illumination. In this technique, the laser beam is displaced laterally with respect to the optical axis of the secondary reflector, such that the beam impinges on an off-axis subaperture of the primary reflector that is not obscured by the secondary reflector and baffle...|$|R
