Though it proved superior to the M1918 in accuracy when fired in automatic mode using the prone position, and equal in accuracy to the standard M1918 at ranges of 500-600 yards (460-550 m) when fired from a rest, it was less accurate when fired from the shoulder, and had a loud report combined with a fierce muzzle blast. Attaching a Cutts compensator materially reduced the muzzle blast, but this was more than offset by the increase in smoke and dust at the muzzle when fired, obscuring the operator's vision. Nor did it improve control of the weapon when fired in bursts of automatic fire. Though the report recommended building six of these short-barrelled 'jungle' BARs for further evaluation, no further work was done on the project.|$|E

This study explores the use of spray quenching {{as an alternative to the}} commonly used bath quenching, which is known to yield relatively slow quench rates and provide few options for spatial optimization of cooling rate. A carefully configured spray cooling system is examined, which provides maximum coverage of the surface of a solid alloy cylinder and that of an alloy tube with full-cone pressure sprays. A new analytical model is derived to determine the shape and size of the spray impact zone, as well as the distribution of volumetric flux across the curved surface of the <b>cylinder</b> and <b>tube.</b> This distribution is combined with heat transfer correlations for all spray boiling regimes to generate a local boiling curve for every location across the impact surface. Using these boiling curves as boundary conditions, a transient analysis is conducted for aluminum alloy and steel <b>cylinders</b> and <b>tubes.</b> Increasing the nozzle pressure drop or decreasing the orifice-to-surface distance are shown to hasten the exit from the poor film boiling regime to the more efficient transition boiling regime, resulting in a quicker quench. Relatively high thermal diffusivity causes faster transmission of the spray cooling effect through the curved surface and milder temperature gradients in aluminum compared to steel. This also causes the outer surface to cool earlier but deeper points much slower for steel. Large temperature gradients are encountered on the surface during the quench because of different boiling regimes occurring at different locations exposed to the spray. This study highlights several practical advantages of spray quenching compared with bath quenching, including the ability to achieve a wide range of fast quench rates, uniformity and predictability of quench rate, and the ability to predict and guard against imperfections caused by thermal stresses. ...|$|R

This allows the developer to achieve an almost perfect impedance matching between the air and porous absorbing materials, such as foams, sponges, etc. Measurements of sound reflection coefficients from different absorbing materials combined with matching metamaterial layers formed by the arrays of brass tubes have been carried out in an anechoic chamber at the frequency range of 500 - 3000 Hz. The results show that the presence of matching metamaterial layers brings substantial reduction in the sound reflection coefficients, thus increasing the efficiency of sound absorption...|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} {{determining}} material parameters {{associated with a}} conductor using four points includes injecting and extracting alternating current into the plate using current-carrying wires operatively connected {{to two of the}} four points, measuring potential drop between the remaining two of the four points, and calculating the material parameters. The conductor can be of a homogenous material, a stratified material, or other type of material. The conductor can have any number of geometries, including that of a plate, a <b>cylinder,</b> a <b>tube,</b> a stratified <b>cylinder</b> or other shape...|$|R
