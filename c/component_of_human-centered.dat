40|$|Abstract. Multi-camera {{networks}} offer potentials for {{a variety}} of novel human-centric applications through provisioning of rich visual information. In this paper, face orientation analysis and posture analysis are combined as <b>components</b> <b>of</b> a <b>human-centered</b> interface system that allows the user’s intentions and region of interest to be estimated without requiring carried or wearable sensors. In pose estimation, image observations at the cameras are first locally reduced to parametrical descriptions, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is then used for optimization of the kinematics chain of the 3 D human model. In face analysis, a discrete-time linear dynamical system (LDS), based on kinematics of the head, combines the local estimates of the user’s gaze angle produced by the cameras and employs spatiotemporal filters to correct any inconsistencies. Knowing the intention and the region of interest of the user facilitates further interpretation of human behavior, which is the key to non-restrictive and intuitive human-centered interfaces. Applications in assisted living, speaker tracking, and gaming can benefit from such unobtrusive interfaces. ...|$|R

30|$|An {{ultimate}} goal <b>of</b> <b>human-centered</b> computing is making human beings {{the center of}} computing technologies. To make people a core <b>component</b> <b>of</b> the technology, first of all, {{we need to understand}} people and society in which people live. In this paper, we propose two important factors in order to understand people and their social interactions. Proposed human activity recognition and neighbor discovery schemes help us comprehend human activities and their social behaviors. In addition, combination of these two mechanisms provide us with an opportunity for better understanding of people in the near future. Finally, it might be worth analyzing correlation between human activities and social interactions for the group of people using our proposed schemes.|$|R

40|$|In 1989 the ACM {{task force}} on the Core of Computer Science argued that “What can be (effectively) automated? ” is “the {{fundamental}} question underlying all of computing”. The task force's view of computing was a machine-oriented one; the task force recognized the theoretical, empirical, and design-oriented aspects of computer science. The question “What can be effectively automated? ” indeed draws some fundamental limits of automatic computation. However, since the 1980 s {{there has been an}} ongoing shift away from the machine-centered view of computing, towards a <b>human-centered</b> view <b>of</b> computing. In this paper I argue that human-centered computing necessitates a perspective shift in computer science.

40|$|This article {{presents}} a constrained review of human factors issues relevant to adaptive automation (AA), including designing complex system interfaces to support AA, facilitating human–computer interaction and crew interactions in adaptive system operations, and considering workload associated with AA {{management in the}} design of human roles in adaptive systems. Unfortunately, these issues have received limited attention in earlier reviews of AA. This work is aimed at supporting a general theory <b>of</b> <b>human-centered</b> automation advocating humans as active information processors in complex system control loops to support situation awareness and effective performance. The review demonstrates the need for research into user-centered design of dynamic displays in adaptive systems. It also points to the need for discretion in designing transparent interfaces to facilitate human awareness of modes of automated systems. Finally, the review identifies the need to consider critical human–human interactions in designing adaptive systems. This work describes important branches of a developing framework of AA research and contributes to the general theory <b>of</b> <b>human-centered</b> automation. 1...|$|R
