25|$|The {{camp was}} never finished, and its {{structures}} were looted in 1941. As a result, {{it was in}} poor shape when the first prisoners arrived, and the situation would deteriorate further in the months to come, when the camp came under German control. The camp had a roughly rectangular shape, surrounded by a triple barbed wire fence, with guard towers at every 200 m. The camp's gate was {{on the western side}} of the fence. Most buildings were clustered on the northern half of the camp. Blocks 1 to 4 were located there, built in a staggered line towards the East. These were two-storey barracks buildings, divided in two equal but separate sections, western and eastern, with separate entrances to each. In addition, the north-eastern corner housed storage houses, the mess hall, the baths (Block 16), where the women's solitary confinement cells were also located, the workshops (Block 21) and the camp headquarters (Block 20). The infamous Block 15, located to the east of the headquarters, was the solitary <b>confinement</b> <b>facility,</b> with the camp guard's quarters and mess room. In the south-eastern corner there was the isolated women's wing (Block 6). Under the Germans, the first floor housed Jewish women, while the second floor was reserved for Christians. In total, over 300 Christian and 2,500 Jewish women passed through Haidari beginning on 7 December 1943, including heroines of the Resistance such as Iro Konstantopoulou or Lela Karagianni (executed on 5 and 8 September 1944 respectively).|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{economic}} impact of changing pig space allotments in a pig production system. Increasing concerns regarding {{the health and well-being of}} meat animals raised in <b>confinement</b> <b>facilities</b> have resulted in consideration of increasing the space allotment for animals. A survey was conducted to determine pig space allotments currently in use by the industry. Pig space allocations per pig currently in use averaged 7. 19 square feet for <b>confinement</b> <b>facilities</b> and 11. 57 square feed for hoop systems. A simulation model was developed to use in evaluating economic impacts of increasing pig space allotments above those currently in use. Space restrictions result in two key economic impacts: 1) an under utilization of the existing confinement production asset base, and 2) a resulting impact on potential marketing practices. Three major results emerged. First, restricting pig space has significant negative financial consequences for existing commercial confinement swine production systems. Secondly, marketing weight and timing mitigation strategies can be a short-term solution when compared to restricting flows into the finishing phase of production, but are clearly inferior to th...|$|R

40|$|Passed in 2003, the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) is {{the first}} federal civil statute focused {{specifically}} on addressing sexual violence in juvenile facilities, jails, prisons, lockups, and other facilities. PREA established the National Prison Rape Elimination Commission, which held hearings about sexual misconduct in custody, issued reports {{on the problem of}} sexual victimization in secure facilities, and proposed standards for the prevention, detection, and response to sexual misconduct in criminal and juvenile justice settings. The law provided for data collection, technical assistance, early funding to assist states, and periodic reviews of facilities with high and low rates of victimization. PREA required the the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) to examine the prevalence of sexual misconduct in juvenile facilities.

40|$|Results {{from this}} and other studies have shown a clear {{association}} between pork production systems that are accessible to Toxoplasma gondii vectors, such as cats, and seropositivity of hogs for T. gondii. Sows and market hogs in pork production systems that had total <b>confinement</b> <b>facilities</b> in phases (farrowing, nursery, finishing) were {{significantly less likely to}} be seropositive for T. gondii. Of the market hogs tested, 4. 4 % from nonconfinement facilities were positive compared with 2. 3 % of the hogs from all <b>confinement</b> <b>facilities.</b> Pigs produced in systems that used bait and/or traps as the only method of rodent control had significantly fewer animals seropositive for T. gondii. Reducing the level of toxoplasmosis can have a direct impact on consumers. Given this, and the lack of direct economic incentives for pork producers, industry programs would be helpful in assisting consumer and producer benefits to better match. Moreover, consumer assurance of the safety of pork is vital to continued and enhanced demand for pork, both domestically and internationally. Moreover, there is an increased consumer awareness of foodborne pathogens. The demand for safe food products is increasing. A T. gondii food-safety incident related to pork would erode the consumer image, potentially leading to reduced demand, {{at least in the short}} term. The industry needs to evaluate methods of reducing cat accessibility to pig production systems...|$|R
