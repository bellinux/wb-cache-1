The two instrumentals, [...] "Droned" [...] and [...] "Hand in Hand", were progressive rock instrumentals with the first featuring an exotic African sound, while [...] "Hand in Hand" [...] featured jazz elements and a children's choir humming the music and improvisational instrumentation by Collins and the Phenix Horns. [...] "The Roof Is Leaking" [...] had Delta blues and country elements. [...] "Behind the Lines" [...] was originally released by Genesis on their Duke album as a progressive rock number, yet Collins worked up a new, horn-driven R&B/funk-inspired arrangement after speeding up the tape on the Genesis version and thinking that the sped-up version sounded like a Michael Jackson song.

40|$|Cue: What kind of soil is {{good for}} growing crops? An obvious answer is a fertile soil, one that {{contains}} large quantities of the minerals and nutrients that plants need. It is also {{good to have a}} soil which can hold a lot of water. Soil with good water holding capacity can sustain plants for longer during dry spells, thereby saving crops that might otherwise dry up and die. Adding organic matter to the soil, such as compost or animal manure, improves the quality of the soil in both ways. It increases nutrient levels and also increases the water holding capacity. It also gives the soil a better structure, by creating larger spaces between the soil particles. This improves the infiltration of rainwater, and gives the plant roots the air that they need to function. Mathias Ngong is a banana farmer in the village of Babungo in Cameroon?s North West province. He is also an expert on using organic manure. Martha Chindong asked him what he had learned about applying compost and animal dung from his many years of farming. IN:		?<b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> tell us the methods ?? OUT:		??have your manure without straining. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 38 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Mathias Ngong, a banana farmer from Cameroon?s North West province, explaining to Martha Chindong about the value of manure and compost to boost the water holding capacity of the soil, and improve his harvests of bananas. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Chindong	<b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> tell us the methods, better ways of applying organic manure? Ngong	Yes first of all to make organic manure is simple. You get all this grass that we clear from the compound, get some wood ash, get soil, put it underneath. If you have some cow dung or any dung, put it on it and then you put your grass, just drop a bit of water and allow it there. It is good to do it before the rainy season and then when water drops on it, it gets rotten. It gives you very good compost manure which you can use. Anybody can do that very easily. Then for those who have the dung, either goat droppings, fowl droppings, cow dung, those are good manures too that you can use, but with this one you must allow it for sometime. You know before you apply on the plant you allow it to decompose. The heat will come out and then it will be soft, you will not damage the plant. Now even with the bananas you see, when I want to plant banana I dig the hole, sizeable - about 60 centimetres wide and 60 deep, put the compost manure which you have prepared, put it under, fine, mix it with soil, surface soil. The soil right deep under, take it away because that one has no use. The surface soil, mix it and then you plant your suckers and some people use very tall suckers to plant, this is not good. You plant suckers which have no leaves yet, sometimes very little suckers, put them, bury them in the ground, let them disappear and let them come out by themselves. Then when they come out the results will be very good. Chindong	<b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> tell us the methods, better ways of applying organic manure? Ngong	Well you get under the plants, soften the soil, you soften the soil around it then get the manure, put it round the plant. As water is entering it is sinking into the soil, it will help the roots of the plant to gain food and it will grow very well. Then to protect it from sunlight, if you are a farmer you must prepare some of these things. When you clear your grass do not throw, pack it somewhere. This grass you will use to what we locally call you give the VIP treatment to the plant. Chindong	That is mulching? Ngong	Yes mulching, you mulch the plant now with grass so that the soil under the plant remains moist, wet. The sun will be there quite alright but you find the plant fresh because the underneath is soft and the grass prevents sun from heating directly into the soil to burn the roots and make it weak and dry up the water. That is how you can give some VIP treatment to your plant. Chindong	That is what I am seeing in front of us? Ngong	That is what I have done here, as you can see. If you like I can open the soil and you see, down there. Once in a while, if you planted vegetables and so on this hand fork is very important. You loosen the soil with it like this, soften it round. You are not damaging the roots but you are giving room for air to get into the soil, because if it is harder, you have been throwing water the surface is hard, the plant will not grow. You soften it once in a while. You know if you are a farmer you must devote time. You soften it as I am doing this one like this, when you soften, soften, it gives room for water to penetrate easily and air, because air gets into the soil too. It will help your plant to pick up. Chindong	Ok if you want to broadcast, say you want to plant on a large surface, can you carry the manure like what we are seeing, in this bucket, and throw on the ridge before you hoe it? Is it necessary, is it important? Ngong	Yes, it is important. If you have the cow dung in large quantities you soften the soil, throw the manure in it and at the time you are forming the ridges the manure is just getting into those ridges ? that is, after you have dug the place put your manure. Then when you are forming the ridges the manure is already getting into the soil. It makes the whole place, even if it was barren it would be now rich for planting. Chindong	The only thing is that to have a large quantity of it is difficult too? Ngong	Well, many more farmers are understanding now the use of organic manure so the rush for it is high. So it is also advisable to do what we call mixed farming, because you had 3, 4, 5 pigs and some poultry around, you always have your manure without straining. End of trackAdding compost and farmyard manure to soil both increases fertility and soil health, and improves the water holding content...|$|E
40|$|In {{his essay}} {{collection}} Another Future, Alan Gilbert argues that culture, at it’s best, “interrogates {{the gap between}} the ideal and the real. ” Ad copy, public text, Hallmark cards, narrative film, etc flood ‘the masses’ with the ideal: the dream of love, the dream of the new, happiness, happiness, happiness, while it purports to be ‘real. ’ Conversely, a fair portion of art positions itself staunchly against the marketplace, it too claiming ‘realness,’ a superiority to ‘representation,’ a championing of ‘authenticity’ and ‘the individual experience. ’ Art and poetry can be a venue to complicate this dichotomy, demystify all cultural products, and question the usage of massive words such as ‘real,’ ‘dream,’ ‘new,’ love. ’ Maybe {{the most effective way to}} interrogate the gap between ‘ideal’ and ‘real’ is to read “the social poetically and poetry socially. ” While post-modernism concentrated on experimentation with form and bridging a ‘high’ and ‘low’ divide, Gilbert argues that what comes next is an emphasis on the “social ramifications of cultural products. ” As Kenneth Goldsmith says, “Context is the new content. ” But I’m not interested in simplistic Conceptualist copy and paste. The function of art shifts to an aggregation and recontextualization of information: how ‘ideal’ and ‘real’ are represented, implemented, and manipulated across various social contexts. Artist John Baldessari asks: “Where does art reside? Is it physically there in that painting? Is it in my head? Could it be a trace memory? Could it be a photo? What is necessary for it? <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> talk about it?” For me, there’s little difference between creating a cultural product, writing ‘about’ someone else’s cultural product, or interviewing artists about cultural products they made. Warhol thought of his body of work as equally visual and vocal: Andy is not Andy without his interviews. Conversation as poem. The conversation in the media around a poem as poem. Example: a poem by Kristen Stewart, a Hollywood actress, cannot be divorced from the reactions and retaliations it spawned. The content of Stewart’s poem, her word choice or where she broke the line fades to the background as voices across the Internet use the poem as an opportunity to judge and humiliate her. I’m concerned with how capital P Poetry is represented in the mainstream, how people experience poetry outside the context of the small press world, and reclaiming such experiences as Poetry. Can a commercial that features Whitman be labelled as a poem? Can my writing about how Whitman is represented in an iPad commercial be a poem? Or, how does listening to a poem while observing one’s surroundings influence one’s experience of the poem? In the ‘I listen’ series, I try to acknowledge that poems do not create a world, but exist within one. And I think of this book as lyric poetry, but my ‘lyric I’ must account for itself and its contexts. It must interview and interrogate itself. Even knowing what the lyric I is requires a privileged position. This must be acknowledged, and leads to a reckoning with former selves, former heroes. The ‘multitudes’ I contain are not my fellow citizens, but all the cultural products I’ve consumed in thirty years and how those products and individuals have changed me. I’m approaching cultural products and their contexts from a subjective, lyric, populist lens, trying to articulate each subject’s intention, because for me it’s in the absurdity of intention where the humor, or the poetry, or the ‘real,’ or ‘profound experience of art’ resides...|$|E
40|$|Building on food {{security}} Cue: If small-scale farmers aren?t {{even able to}} grow enough food for their families, they certainly aren?t ready to think about cash crop production. All across Africa, millions of small farmers feel trapped in low productivity, with no way of improving either their {{food security}} or their livelihood. And for many farmers in Zambia, life {{in the last ten}} years has become more difficult not less; a succession of droughts combined with a government policy for economic liberalisation, have cut farm productivity among poorer farmers in particular. For Zambia?s Programme Against Malnutrition, known as ?Pam?, the challenge is greater than ever. This non-government organisation is now working closely with the Zambian government, through a variety of initiatives, to support small-scale farmers. The ?food security pack? scheme, for example, is currently distributing vital farming inputs, such as seed and fertilizer, to the most needy. But beyond that, the programme has also recognised the importance of farmers being able to get real economic benefits from any increase in their production. Daniel Sikazwe sent us this report on the work of the Programme Against Malnutrition in his home country, Zambia. IN:		?Ten years ago, Zambia ? OUT:		?value to food crops. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 44 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: That report came from Daniel Sikazwe, and featured Mlotha Damaseke, manager of the food security pack scheme, for the Programme Against Malnutrition in Zambia. Transcript Sikazwe	Ten years ago, Zambia embarked on an ambitious liberalisation programme; subsidies in crucial areas like agriculture were removed. Some small-scale farmers found themselves out of business, while others persevered. In this programme we will try to establish what impacts liberalisation has had on small-scale farmers; how those who have continued with their farming activities have managed to stay alive in the midst of an uncertain food security situation. Mr. Mlotha Damaseke is the food security pack manager at the Programme Against Malnutrition, PAM, a non-governmental organisation that has been working with small-scale farmers over the years. What did liberalisation entail on small-scale farmers? Damaseke	The main problem is in terms of input supply. The country is quite big, the infrastructure for service delivery, is quite poor, and that left them very very vulnerable. Most of the people who are benefiting are large-scale farmers who are along the main trunk roads, but eighty percent of our producers, especially for staple foods, are small-scale farmers. This has had an adverse effect on the amount of food that is produced in the country. Sikazwe	I?ve come across a lot of small-scale farmers that have talked about working with the Programme Against Malnutrition, and that they have somehow managed to rise above the impacts of liberalisation. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> tell me what PAM has been doing with the small-scale farmers? Damaseke	Yes indeed. PAM was implementing a number of interventions, some of which are coming from government initiatives. For example the food security pack is targeting the small-scale farmers who have been left helpless by the liberalisation of the economy, and the droughts that have been persisting since 1991, and therefore we are assisting the farmers with inputs; so we are delivering inputs to small-scale farmers throughout the country, so that they can become productive once again, and maybe go into a commercial lending portfolio. Sikazwe	Well once you have delivered these inputs to the small-scale farmers, they produce, they need to have a market but then they are competing against heavily subsidised goods coming from South Africa, and probably some other countries. Are there any attempts by the Programme Against Malnutrition to try and help them get a market to try to rise above the challenges of liberalisation? Damaseke	In fact, as a way of addressing that problem, the programme has got a component, which is looking at management of excess produce. It?s called the cereal or seed bank component. This is a concept where communities themselves, come together; they make their own storage facilities. The aim to do that is: one, you have small-scale farmers coming at one point, putting in, each one brings whether it is one tin, or it?s one bag, or it?s ten bags, they get an inventory of each person who brings excess produce. And then they can decide when to sell. If they want to keep it for a longer period so that they can sell it when the price is right, for example during the start of the rainy season in January or February, then they sell the excess crop. So that is one way of enhancing the profitability of farming. Sikazwe	Well, there has been an argument that some small-scale farmers have been small-scale farmers for a long time; they need to graduate. And attempts that effect to make them graduate into, maybe not commercial farmers, but at least above small-scale farmers, through the aid or help that the Programme Against Malnutrition is giving to the small-scale farmers? Damaseke	Yes, the efforts are there. I think what is important is for people to realise is that before a person can feed himself or herself, there is no way that they will grow bigger. Firstly they must solve the first problem; the first problem is hunger in the house. If he solves the problem of hunger in the household, then he will think of having more. And therefore, efforts are being made to see that those who are able to feed themselves for one year, and have excess, maybe be linked to for example, the micro-bankers trust, who can lend them, on terms that they are able to pay back, and then become bigger farmers. So that is one initiative that the small-scale farmers must look for. They should not remain subsistence farmers. Sikazwe	Liberalisation has surely come to stay in Zambia. How do you look at the future of small-scale farmers? Damaseke	I think they need to take the initiative. The way the formation of co-operatives. If co-operatives are formed where people come together, they buy inputs together, that should be the way to go. Another way is contract cropping by out-grower schemes, that is another way to go. And also adding value to their crop; processing foods so that they don?t go to waste when they are in abundance. Whether it?s groundnuts; is it just roasting, or are you going to make peanut butter and things like that. So there is a component that is looking at adding value to food crops. End of track. The Food Security Pack manager with Zambia?s Programme Against Malnutrition explains how the programme is working to support small-scale farmers, and help them move from better food security towards commercial production...|$|E
