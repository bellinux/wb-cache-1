The gas is attracted to the carbon material via Van der Waals forces. Some carbons {{have been able to}} achieve bonding energies of 5–10 kJ per mol. The gas may then be desorbed when subjected to higher temperatures and either combusted to do work {{or in the case of}} hydrogen gas extracted for use in a hydrogen fuel <b>cell.</b> <b>Gas</b> storage in activated carbons is an appealing gas storage method because the gas can be stored in a low pressure, low mass, low volume environment that would be much more feasible than bulky on board compression tanks in vehicles. The United States Department of Energy has specified certain goals to be achieved in the area of research and development of nano-porous carbon materials. All of the goals are yet to be satisfied but numerous institutions, including the ALL-CRAFT program, are continuing to conduct work in this promising field.|$|E
50|$|VRLA Gel and AGM {{batteries}} offer {{several advantages}} compared with VRLA flooded lead acid and conventional standard lead-acid batteries. The battery can be mounted in any position, since the valves only operate on over-pressure faults. Since the battery {{system is designed}} to be recombinant and eliminate the emission of gases on overcharge, room ventilation requirements are reduced, and no acid fume is emitted during normal operation. Flooded <b>cell</b> <b>gas</b> emissions are of little consequence in all but the smallest confined areas, and pose very little threat to a domestic user, so a wet cell battery designed for longevity gives lower costs per kWh. In a gel battery, the volume of free electrolyte that could be released on damage to the case or venting is very small. There is no need (or ability) to check the level of electrolyte or to top up water lost due to electrolysis, reducing inspection and maintenance requirements. Wet cell batteries can be maintained by a self-watering system or by topping up every three months. The requirement to add distilled water is normally caused by overcharging. A well-regulated system should not require top-up more often than every three months.|$|E

The influence of the <b>cell</b> <b>gas</b> type (i. e. He, He+H 2 and He+NH 3), <b>cell</b> <b>gas</b> flow rate and sample pre-treatment (i. e. water dilution or acid digestion) on the background-equivalent concentration (BEC) of several nuclides covering the mass range from 7 to 238 u has been studied. Results obtained in this work show that, operating the collision/reaction cell with a compromise <b>cell</b> <b>gas</b> flow rate (i. e. 4 mL min− 1) improves BEC values for interfered nuclides without {{a significant effect on}} the BECs for non-interfered nuclides, {{with the exception of the}} light elements Li and Be. Among the different <b>cell</b> <b>gas</b> mixtures tested, the use of He or He+H 2 is preferred over He+NH 3 because NH 3 generates new spectral interferences. No significant influence of the sample pre-treatment methodology (i. e. dilution or digestion) on the multi-element capabilities of CCT-ICP-MS in the context of simultaneous analysis of interfered and non-interfered nuclides was observed. Nonetheless, sample dilution should be kept at minimum to ensure that light nuclides (e. g. Li and Be) could be quantified in wine. Finally, a direct 5 -fold aqueous dilution is recommended for the simultaneous trace and ultra-trace determination of spectrally interfered and non-interfered elements in wine by means of CCT-ICP-MS. The use of the CCT is mandatory for interference-free ultra-trace determination of Ti and Cr. Only Be could not be determined when using the CCT due to a deteriorated limit of detection when compared to conventional ICP-MS. G.

40|$|Closed-cell foams made of {{polymers}} {{have the}} lowest thermal conductivity of any currently available insulation material other than vacuum insulation systems. The increase of foam conductivity with age occurs as air diffuses into the foam while the blowing agent diffuses out, thus modifying the <b>cell</b> <b>gas</b> composition. Also, the change in <b>cell</b> <b>gas</b> composition influences the dimensional stability of the foams. To predict the long term aging behavior and dimensional stability of these foams, the diffusion characteristics of the different components need to be known. Several models {{exist in the literature}} which describe diffusion in foams. The most popular of these models are reviewed, and effective diffusivities predicted from one model are compared with experimental data. An unsteady state model is then proposed and solved numerically using a finite difference scheme. The numerical solution algorithm is developed to efficiently solve the large number of coupled equations resulting from this model. The uptake curves predicted from both the unsteady-state model and a discrete model (Bart and Du Cauze De Nazelle, 1993) are compared with available experimental data for the polystyrene-nitrogen system. From the analysis of uptake curves generated for different numbers of cells, the effective diffusivity of the PS/N 2 system is predicted. Also, the effect of initial <b>cell</b> <b>gas</b> composition and cell size on both the long term aging profile and dimensional stability of polyurethane foam is considered. The proposed model can easily be extended to include the influence of blowing agent concentration on diffusivity in the polymer phase and the isotherm describing the distribution of blowing agent between the gas and polymer phases...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the studies}} that {{comprise}} this thesis was to predict the heat loss over time {{from a range of}} district heating pipes insulated with closed-cells foam. The thermal conductivity of the foam changes over time when it is not diffusion-tight encapsulated against the environment, as diffusion alters the <b>cell</b> <b>gas</b> composition until it reaches equilibrium with the surrounding air. Over the first thirty years of use the insulation capacity of a straight pipe of medium size insulated with polyurethane foam decreases by about 10 %. The insulating gases cyclopentane and carbon dioxide initially present in the foam cells diffuse out of the foam over time, while nitrogen and oxygen from the air diffuse into it. Complete ageing increases the thermal conductivity of the insulation by about 10 mW·m- 1 ·K- 1, but it is a slow process that takes several years. Equilibrium is not even reached after 100 years. In this work models have been derived {{that can be used to}} predict the long-term heat flow from the pipes and investigate the influence of factors that have an impact. Finite difference models for the pipes alone are presented, which consider the variation of the <b>cell</b> <b>gas</b> composition over the foam cross section. All gases are considered in the gas phase. But cyclopentane is also considered in dissolved state, as well as potentially in liquid state depending on the amount and the temperature present. In order to determine the solubility of cyclopentane in the polyurethane matrix of the foam measurements were performed. The solubility was found to decrease with temperature. About 50 % of the cyclopentane was dissolved at room temperature, while only about 35 % was dissolved at 50 ᵒC. There is a weak coupling between the heat conduction (i. e. temperature) and the gas diffusion (i. e. <b>cell</b> <b>gas</b> content) due to the fact that the thermal conductivity is dependent both on the temperature and the <b>cell</b> <b>gas</b> content, which has been taken into consideration. Both single and twin pipe geometry have been studied. Complex mathematics in the form of a coordinate transformation is needed to perform the predictions for twin pipe geometry. To model installed pipes, a stationary model for annularly insulated pipes in the ground has been developed, which also involves complicated mathematics. The temperature is represented by series expansions; in each region with differing thermal conductivity a separate expansion is used. The expansions are matched to each other at the region boundaries and chosen to fulfil the boundary conditions. Finally, the measured <b>cell</b> <b>gas</b> status of aged pipes and the results obtained by modelling based on assumptions of their initial status and ageing conditions have been compared. It was found that the actual aged pipes contained less oxygen and more carbon dioxide than predicted. This is probably due to oxidation. It is interesting to note that not only the oxygen but also the carbon dioxide content is influenced by oxidation. By consuming oxygen and producing carbon dioxide the oxidation will slow down the decrease of the insulation performance...|$|E

In {{order to obtain}} the maximum {{neutralization}} of energetic ions (providing maximum neutral beam power) and reduce the heat load on beamline internal components caused by residual energetic ions, sufficient neutral gas must be injected into the beamline neutralizer cell.

Experimental data {{gathered from the}} world's first pressurized hybrid SOFC-GT system tested at the University of California, Irvine, capture performance variations due to diurnal temperature oscillations. A dynamic modeling methodology demonstrates accuracy, robustness, and clearly identifies critical system sensitivities that require additional control systems development. Simulation results compare favorably with dynamic experimental responses. Predictions of component temperatures, pressures, voltage and system power exhibited 5 °C, 2 kPa, 2 mV, and 0. 5 % error respectively. Moderate ambient temperature fluctuations, 15 °C, caused variations in stack temperature of 30 °C, and system power of 5 kW. Small to moderate changes in fuel composition produced 30 °C shifts in stack temperature and 25 % changes in system power. Simple control loops manipulating fuel cell air flow through SOFC bypass and inlet temperature through recuperator bypass are shown to effectively mitigate internal temperature transients {{at the expense of}} reduced system output. The observed temperature fluctuations resulting from typical environmental perturbations are of concern for performance loss and diminished longevity.

A comparison test between a 10 -cm normal transmission-type <b>gas</b> <b>cell</b> and a 3 -m Herriot <b>gas</b> <b>cell</b> was carried out to demonstrate the improvement.

The Hyper facility at NETL is a hardware simulation of a fuel <b>cell</b> <b>gas</b> turbine hybrid power system capable of emulating systems {{in the range of}} 300 kW to 900 kW.

Little cigars gained popularity over the last decade until tobacco taxes made cigarettes more expensive in the USA. Many little cigar brands are similar in size with cigarettes and may be smoked in a similar manner. Scant data are available on HPHC concentrations in little cigars, therefore we developed and applied a new analytical method to determine concentrations of 10 toxic metals in little cigar tobacco. The method utilizes 'triple quadrupole' ICP-MS. By optimizing octapole bias, energy discrimination and <b>cell</b> <b>gas</b> flow settings, we were able to accurately quantify a range of elements including those for which the <b>cell</b> <b>gas</b> reactions were endothermic. All standard modes (Single Quad No Gas, MS-MS NH 3 /He and MS-MS O 2) were utilized for the quantitation of 10 toxic metals in little cigar tobacco, including uranium, which was added as an analyte in the new method. Because of the elimination of interfering ions at 'shifted analyte masses', detection limits were lower compared with a previous method. Tobacco selenium concentrations were below the limit of detection in the previous method, but the new technology made it possible to report all selenium concentrations.
