5|$|This {{is not the}} <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> offence, it is {{the removal}} of a common law fiction which has become anachronistic and {{offensive}} and we {{consider that it is}} our duty having reached that conclusion to act upon it.|$|E
5|$|By 1661, Copenhagen had {{asserted}} {{its position}} as capital of Denmark and Norway. All the major institutions were located there, {{as was the}} fleet {{and most of the}} army. The defences were further enhanced with the completion of the Citadel in 1664 and the extension of Christianshavns Vold with its bastions in 1692, leading to the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> base for the fleet at Nyholm.|$|E
5|$|In August 2011, the TFG {{announced}} the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> Special Force.

5|$|One of {{his most}} lasting {{legacies}} {{may turn out to}} be his <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> annual tournament called the Laver Cup which pits Europe against the rest of the world. Federer founded the tournament in honor of tennis legend Rod Laver and the inaugural edition was played in 2017.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{immediately}} {{embark on}} the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> Tintin adventure, Hergé {{agreed to a}} proposal that Le Soir crime writer, Paul Kinnet, would author a detective story featuring Thomson and Thompson.

The battle occurred {{as a result of an}} Indonesian effort to storm a British hilltop base at Plaman Mapu, on the border between the Malaysian state of Sarawak and Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|The form of kingdom which {{appeared}} in Constantine's reign continued {{in much the same}} way until the Davidian Revolution in the 12th century. As with his ecclesiastical reforms, his political legacy was the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> form of Scottish kingship that lasted for two centuries after his death.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, the West of China {{has been}} weaker economically, as it {{promises}} a less lucrative {{return to the}} investors than its eastern competitors. Thus, the China Western Development policy aimed to attract foreign investment. This was {{to be done by}} creating a more stable investing environment through infrastructure construction. The <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> economic zone would encourage cooperation between cities, which would lead to greater rates of progress.|$|E
50|$|When the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> WPS, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> top-flight women's {{league that}} would replace/revive the Women's United Soccer Association (WUSA), was {{announced}} in 2006, St. Louis {{was one of the}} then-six cities that would have a team.|$|R
5000|$|In 2000, <b>a</b> group <b>of</b> intellectuals issued <b>a</b> {{manifesto}} for the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> separate <b>New</b> Israel {{which would}} be decidedly more secular than the Israeli status quo. This proposal lost currency following {{the beginning of the}} Second Intifada in 2002.|$|R

5|$|Although {{there were}} several short spells when a third {{division}} was created, the two-division structure remained largely in place until 1975, when a major re-organisation of the league led to a new three-tier set-up and the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> Premier Division at the highest level. In 1998, the teams then in the Premier Division broke away to form the SPL, which supplanted the Premier Division as {{the highest level of}} football in Scotland. The SPL and SFL merged in 2013 to form the Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL), which branded its top division as the Scottish Premiership.|$|E
5|$|Another flaw {{with both}} Wilberforce's and Millett's {{explanations}} {{is that if}} the interest is retained by the lender from the outset of the contract, it is not a resulting trust at all; the complete transfer of money should end the lender's equitable interest. It could be argued that the creation of a Quistclose trust is not based on the recovery of the original interest, but the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> one. Doubts have also been raised about the Twinsectra case in general, in that {{the facts of the case}} did not create a stereotypical Quistclose trust; this causes problems with applying Millett's analysis.|$|E
5|$|Because male-female {{relationships}} are inherently unequal in her society, Wollstonecraft endeavours {{to formulate a}} new kind of friendship in The Wrongs of Woman: motherhood and sisterhood. It is Maria's pathetic story regarding the kidnapping of her child that first interests Jemima in her plight. The novel fragments also suggest that the tale might not end with a marriage, but rather with the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> kind of family, one constituted by two mothers for Maria's child. With Jemima's rescue of Maria, Wollstonecraft appears to reject the traditional romantic plot and invent a new one, necessitated by the failure of society to grant women their natural rights.|$|E
50|$|Although mostly inactive, the Pool {{was officially}} led by IRNA until the mid-1990s {{and then by}} Malaysia's Bernama until 2005, when <b>a</b> ministerial conference <b>of</b> Information by the Non-Aligned Movement called on the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Non-Aligned <b>News</b> Network to resurrect the NANAP.|$|R

5|$|In 1902, Vassar College in {{the town}} of Poughkeepsie, New York, {{completed}} Davison House, the fourth dorm in the college's residential quadrangle (quad). Enrollment was limited to 1,000 students by 1905 and the college saw a need to further expand the number of dorms available so it approved the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> one. Totaling $212,500, construction was paid for using college funds (versus the donor funds that paid for Strong and Davison Houses).|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly Janet Woollard {{called for}} the statue's {{genitalia}} to be covered up, but nothing was done. In November 2005 Richard Wilkes again {{called for the}} statue's groin to be covered, {{on the grounds that}} such a depiction would be more historically accurate, as Yagan would have worn a covering for most of the year. Also under consideration is the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> statue with a head shape that accords better with the forensic reconstruction of Yagan's head.|$|E
5|$|Kouandété {{launched}} another coup against Soglo on December 17, but he {{was forced}} to hand power to Alley two days later. His administration oversaw the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> constitution and a presidential election, Dahomey's first since 1964. The results were annulled because of a boycott that prevented almost three-quarters of the country from voting. Alley lost popularity with the suggestion that the military should retreat back to the barracks, and was eventually reduced to a mouthpiece for Kouandété. On July 17, 1968, Alley was forced to hand power to Emile Zinsou, a veteran politician.|$|E
