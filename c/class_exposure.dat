40|$|Investments such as venture capital, buyouts, {{distressed debt}} or assimilated, have the {{peculiarity}} of being difficult to value {{due to their}} illiquid nature on the market. The lack of transparency {{is determined by the}} market value being either determined infrequently or estimated through an "appraisal" process. Both methods of evaluation lead to the "smoothing" of returns, implying that the reported performance metrics are biased: in particular, the estimated volatility is lower than the true volatility of the investment. We propose and test two multi-index methods to evaluate performance of mezzanine, distressed debt and hedge funds, aiming at overcoming the existing gaps in the current traditional portfolio analysis. The proposed models are able to capture non-linear market effects - asset <b>class</b> <b>exposure</b> and style factor model - with the advantage of remaining in the simple framework of the linear regression analysis. We discuss the results obtained and compare them with the outcomes of a traditional regression analysis. The paper is organized as follows: section 1 provides additional arguments to support the current methodology; section 2 presents the two types of methods used in the analysis and introduces the extensions to these models to incorporate market-lagged effects; section 3 describes the data used for the analysis, namely series of returns for three funds: mezzanine, distressed debt, and hedge fund; section 4 provides interpretation and comparisons of the results obtained when using different specifications of the first method based on the asset <b>class</b> <b>exposure</b> models whereas section 5 discusses the results obtained from different specifications of the style factor model.

40|$|Actuaries {{have long}} since {{recognized}} the value of survival analysis for calculating case reserves. While {{there is also a}} patent connection between setting case reserves and loss development, the tools of survival analysis have been largely ignored in building loss development models. This may be explained in part from history: data storage and computation limitations have traditionally restricted loss development models to aggregated data unsuited to the analysis of individual lives. Until fairly rece'ntly, actuarial mathematics has followed an unnecessarily restrictive interpretation of survival analysis. The thesis of this paper is that comparatively recent advances in data processing and in survival analysis theory can be exploited to provide an alternative approach to loss development. Computerized insurance data files now enable automatic production of loss and premium "triangles " directly from individual claim and individual policy rating <b>class</b> <b>exposure</b> data. That suggests building development models directly from microdata. Moreover, much of that data is transactional, making it a natural fit to survival analysis models. The idea is to regard paid losses on open claims as "right-censored' " along the lines in which incomplete information is handled in the accelerated failure time models of biostatistics and engineering. It is no longer the claimant that represents a "life " but the claim itself with "death " or 'failure " corresponding to claim closure. Also, the paper discusses the use of paid dollars [...] as well as time [...] to parameterize the progression from claim emergence to claim closure. The discussion argues that, under this setup, the "expectation of life "plays the role of "case reserve ". The paper considers the application of this case reserve to "develop" paid losses to "ultimate incurred losses ". The main result of the paper is the proof that this "ultimate loss " model has the correct mean, namely the same mean as the accelerated failure time model, but without the complicating presence of censored observations. 28...|$|E

However, less is known about the effects of preschool television on subsequent bullying involvement. We examined the association between television viewing time through ages 2 - 5 and bullying involvement in the first grades of elementary school. We hypothesized that high television exposure increases the risk of bullying involvement. Method. TV viewing time was assessed repeatedly in early childhood using parental report. To combine these repeated assessments we used latent <b>class</b> analysis. Four <b>exposure</b> <b>classes</b> were identified and labeled "low", "mid-low", "mid-high" and "high". Bullying involvement was assessed by teacher questionnaire (n = 3423, mean age 6. 8 years). Additionally, peer/self-report of bullying involvement was obtained using a peer nomination procedure (n = 1176, mean age 7. 6 years). We examined child risk of being a bully, victim or a bully-victim (compared to being uninvolved in bullying). Results: High television <b>exposure</b> <b>class</b> was associated with elevated risks of bullying and victimization. Also, in both teacher- and child-reported data, children in the high television <b>exposure</b> <b>class</b> were more likely to be a bully-victim (OR = 2. 11, 95 % CI: 1. 42 - 3. 13 and OR = 3. 68, 95 % CI: 1. 75 - 7. 74 respectively).

40|$|Background and aims. This thesis took a {{life course}} {{approach}} to examining inequalities in {{quality of life}} in early old age using the French occupational cohort GAZEL. The cohort combines company administrative records with information from annual questionnaires for 20 625 electricity and gas industry employees. The thesis aimed to examine whether current circumstances, retirement routes, mid-life working conditions or occupational grade were associated with subjective quality of life, measured with CASP- 19, in retired participants. Results. Cross-sectional and change analyses using multiple regression demonstrated that social support, financial adequacy and, above all, mental and physical health were strongly associated with quality of life. There was a graded relationship between occupational grade in mid-life and quality of life following labour market exit, a relationship which was largely accounted for by health and financial circumstances in retirement. After adjusting for occupational grade and social <b>class,</b> <b>exposures</b> to physical hazards and ergonomic strain were associated with lower quality of life following retirement; accumulated exposures to carcinogens were not. Pathways from working conditions to poorer quality of life via physical and mental health accounted for the associations between earlier strenuous and dangerous working conditions and quality of life following retirement. Retiring tended to improve subjective quality of life, particularly if it was from difficult psychosocial working conditions. Retiring in ill health was associated with worse quality of life; this retirement route was more likely for individuals who had poor working conditions. Continuing professional activities after retirement was associated with better quality of life, a retirement route more likely for individuals working in higher grades. Conclusions.

Canonical variates (CVA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were used to evaluate the discrimination power of the method among <b>exposure</b> <b>classes</b> (unexposed, Cd exposed, TBA exposed). Misclassification, sensitivity and specificity, both with original and cross-validated cases, were determined. LCFDs frequencies enhanced the differences among classes which were visually selected after their means, respective variances and the differences between Cd and TBA exposed means, with respect to unexposed mean, were analyzed by scatter plots. Selected frequencies were then scanned by means of LDA, stepwise analysis, and Mahalanobis distance to detect the most discriminative frequencies out of ten originally selected. Discrimination resulted in 91. 7 % of cross-validated cases correctly classified (22 out of 24 total cases), with sensitivity and specificity, respectively, of 95. 5 % (1 false negative with respect to 21 really positive cases) and 75 % (1 false positive with respect to 3 really negative cases).

Therefore, {{they must be}} durable enough. This is provided with proper evaluation of the aggressive influences that affect them. For that reason, we use <b>exposure</b> <b>classes</b> described in SIST EN 206 - 1 and SIST 1026. These standards describe the levels of exposure, as well as requirements and recommendations {{for the design of}} concrete related to them. They are gathered in one of the chapters. Further on, we describe aggressive influences, resulting in the deterioration of concrete elements, and the respective processes. To show how to choose the appropriate <b>exposure</b> <b>classes,</b> we also prepared a few examples of structures. For their structural elements, we determined parameters for the preparation of concrete mixtures. In the last chapter we present the results of experimental work aimed at determining how much risk the process of carbonation represents to the structures. For that purpose, we took 18 concrete samples from different locations in Laže and Velenje. Then we made tests with phenolphthalein to measure the depth of carbonation...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{an issue of}} {{shotcrete}} and possibilities of increasing its durability. Theoretical part of the thesis is conceived in a form of summary of current knowledge concerning shotcrete. The emphasis is mainly on the possibilities of using shotcrete in <b>exposure</b> <b>classes</b> XA and XF. The experimental part focuses on laboratory testing of shotcrete. Waterproofness of shotcrete, its surface resistance to water and chemical de-icing agents was tested with regard to a development of its compresive strength during maturation...|$|R

We sought to test whether explosive anger was integrally associated with symptoms of grief amongst the Timorese, a society that has experienced extensive conflict-related losses. In 2010 and 2011 we recruited adults (n = 2964), 18 -years and older, living in an urban and a rural village in Timor-Leste. We applied latent class analysis to identify subpopulations based on symptoms of explosive anger and grief. The best fitting model comprised three classes: grief (24 %), grief-anger (25 %), and a low symptom group (51 %). There were more women and urban dwellers in the grief and grief-anger classes compared to the reference class. Persons in the grief and grief-anger classes experienced higher rates of witnessing murder and atrocities and traumatic losses, ongoing poverty, and preoccupations with injustice for the two historical periods of conflict (the Indonesian occupation and the later internal conflict). Compared to the reference class, only the grief-anger <b>class</b> reported greater <b>exposure</b> to extreme deprivations during the conflict, ongoing family conflict, and preoccupations with injustice for contemporary times; and compared to the grief <b>class,</b> greater <b>exposure</b> to traumatic losses, poverty, family conflict and preoccupations with injustice for both the internal conflict and contemporary times. A substantial number of adults in this post-conflict country experienced a combined constellation of grief and explosive anger associated with extensive traumatic losses, deprivations, and preoccupations with injustice. Importantly, grief-anger {{may be linked to}} family conflict in this post-conflict environment...|$|R
