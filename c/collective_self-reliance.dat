In 2007 Minister of Agriculture of Tanzania visited his counterpart in Indonesia, requesting the resuming of FARTC program. On March 2011, Indonesian Government reactivated FARTC.

Women empowerment was identified by AMUL as one of the important catalysts to realize the goal of Operation Flood (OF) (also called White Revolution of India) that aimed to create a nationwide milk grid in India (NDDB, n.d). In the initial phase of OF, women were trained in modern animal husbandry practices and special incentives were given to women in order to improve participation of women in governance of cooperatives. This led to an enhanced partaking from women and according to National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) annual report of 2001 - 2002, the number of women members in cooperatives increased from 0.62 million in 1986 - 87 to 2.47 million in 2001 - 02 (AMUL, n.d). Similarly ‘Shri Mahila Griha Udyog Lijjat Papad’ established in 1959 by seven Gujarati women in Mumbai (Maharashtra), is based on four founding principles- <b>collective</b> ownership, cooperation, <b>self-reliance</b> and profit sharing (Cole and Liebschutz, 2016).

40|$|A central {{tenet of}} the social {{contract}} is the individual 2 ̆ 7 s obligation to eschew force (with the exception of an inalienable right to self-defence) in return for collective security, with the state holding a monopoly {{on the use of}} force. After centuries of repression and violent conflict 18 th century Enlightenment values sought to fundamentally recast the social contract and redress the power imbalance between the individual and the state. Given the preceding history the state was largely perceived as a malevolent force that acted for narrow interests against the common good. Enlightenment values asserted the pre-eminence of the free, autonomous and self-reliant individual, with the secular state deriving its power/authority/legitimacy through the willing consent of those governed. The question of an appropriate balance between individual rights and social obligations remains a universal quandary. Does a culture that emphasises individual autonomy and self-reliance impact on the broader commitment to a peaceful and harmonious society? Does a libertarian culture inevitably engender some level of mistrust in the state and an associated lack of confidence in <b>collective</b> security? Where <b>self-reliance</b> extends to individual responsibility for personal safety (by providing the individual with the means and authority to resort to force), what are the implications for {{the nature and extent of}} interpersonal violence? For many years the United States has defined itself as an exceptional culturally advanced society that stands as a bastion for liberty against repressive foreign forces. Upholding the citizen 2 ̆ 7 s "natural" right to self-defence by enshrining a right to keep and bear arms in the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution is an integral part of this culture. For the same reasons the United States asserts an absolute right to take pre-emptive military action internationally against foreign adversaries in pursuit of its own self-defence. Domestically there is obvious dissonance between this self-image and the reality of extraordinary levels of interpersonal violence, political polarisation, social alienation and economic inequity. These complex issues are bought into sharp contrast when we try to comprehend why American citizens regularly resort to indiscriminate large-scale violence against innocent civilians (such as mass shootings and occasional bombings). Is it simply because citizens have relatively unrestricted access to the means to effectively undertake such violence, or are there deeper issues about the real level of community commitment to a civilised society...|$|R

40|$|Under {{the regime}} of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), local and {{regional}} policies are increasingly determined by global factors. One example is the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD). It stresses an earlier notion of African Renaissance, which includes the emphasis on <b>collective</b> <b>self-reliance,</b> {{but at the same}} time seeks closer cooperation with the global trade system and its international agencies. Bi- and multilateral trade relations between external actors and individual African states or regional blocs are becoming ever more decisive. This is also true of the more recently negotiated Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) in the post-Lomé era of EU-African relations. In light of such trends the question of coherence between trade as aid and other areas of development strategy and cooperation remains to be answered.

40|$|Historically, {{the people}} of Mozambique have faced oppression and social spatial {{segregation}} and responded {{in a way that}} has reinforced rather than dismantled their traditional values. Since pre-colonial times, the population’s strategy for escaping from environmental and foreign political disruption has been to reinvent tradition, based on the principles of resilience, resistance and self-reliance. The development of decentralised human settlements, involving the appropriation of land for domestic space and the self-organisation of neighbourhoods, were strategies to protect communities from adversity and secure <b>collective</b> <b>self-reliance.</b> Following Mozambique’s conversion to globalization, the post-colonial ‘cement city’ is now the core of neo-liberalism, as a node of the global economy, where foreign donors and international market economy control national political economy, exacerbating the premise of the negation of self-sufficiency that continues to evolve resiliently at its margins. The adoption of a neo-liberal model of development during the 1990 s, completely bypasses the realities of Mozambican society. This paper argues that the strategy of self-production of space regarding the household/Outdoor Domestic Space unit, which existed previously as a resistance strategy, first of all against colonialism and secondly, against the statist definition of socialism, thirdly, has become a successful strategy for survival, as the building block of the decentralised Agrocity, {{in the face of a}} global economy which totally neglects both the people and the land. Outdoor Domestic Space is a multifaceted space that refers to the external space surrounding the built house and which, in the case of Mozambique, is where daily life takes place, involving strong social, ecological and productive functions. Under successive periods of political economy oppression and environmental adversity, the Outdoor Domestic Space has been adapted and refined to ensure <b>collective</b> <b>self-reliance.</b> Shaping a green and ruralised urbanisation at the margins of the Mozambican post-colonial dualistic city, which I call the Agrocity, the Outdoor Domestic Space is resilient because it is able to adjust domestic space as a strategy to secure livelihoods, provide urban food, commerce and services, maintain vital kinship relationships and produce a comfortable and clean microclimate across the spontaneous neighbourhoods. This spatial resilience is the feature underlying the self-organisation of neighbourhoods with a new way of overcoming alienation from nature, which suggest the continuance of an innate relationship between society, the human habitat and natur...|$|E
40|$|PhD - International RelationsThe thesis {{examines}} {{the design and}} implementation of African regional economic cooperation initiatives using the Lagos Plan of Action (LPA) and the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) as comparative case studies. With regards to design, it focuses on the international political economy of the shift from the LPA’s state-led, inward-looking, <b>collective</b> <b>self-reliance</b> model to NEPAD’s outward looking, market-friendly orientations. Pertaining to implementation, it {{examines the}} domestic political economy of institutionalising compliance with regionally agreed policy prescriptions {{in the absence of}} an overarching central authority. It focuses on the level of implementation of the LPA and the prospects of implementing NEPAD. The thesis pursues two main sets of arguments: First, it argues that African states’ common concerns about their vulnerability in the global economy have informed the design of a number of ambitious regional initiatives. Within this context, the shift from the LPA to the NEPAD has been dictated by changes in global realities and circumstances. Second, it argues that individual African governments’ concern with vulnerability nationally has been responsible for the low levels of implementation of regional economic initiatives. In this regard, the prospects for the sustained implementation of regional cooperation initiatives is structured by expectations of socio- economic benefits, the cost of compliance to states and the institutions to enforce compliance. The study employs neo-liberal and nationalist perspectives of international political economy to explain how global realities have dictated Africa’s economic cooperation options. To explain African governments’ attitude towards regional initiatives, the thesis uses insights from comparative political economy. The thesis meanwhile employs insights from institutional economics and rational choice institutionalism to highlight the difficulties of institutionalising compliance with regional policy prescriptions. To capture the differences in the contexts within which the LPA and the NEPAD were crafted and the variations in their orientations, the thesis uses a combination of ‘historical explanation’ and ‘structured focused comparison’ methodology that allows for two separate, but structurally linked accounts of the processes of design and implementation of the two initiatives...|$|E
40|$|The Southern African Development Coordination Conference (SADCC) was {{launched}} in 1980 and includes all of the states of southern Africa {{with the exception of}} South Africa. It seeks to promote regional development through <b>collective</b> <b>self-reliance.</b> The region is exceptionally rich in mineral resources and, as a whole, the SADCC falls within the classification of a "minerals economy'. The minerals sector currently has the role of providing the state with foreign exchange and revenues as almost all minerals are exported. Due to the small size (population, economy, resources) of each SADCC state {{it would be difficult to}} redeploy their minerals sector from its current colonial role to that of providing the foundation for resource-based industrialisation. However, the regional context provides greater possibilities for delinking and the initiation of an autonomous and sustained development process. Strategies for the regional planning of the sub-continental minerals sector are numerous and could include the substitution of mineral and mineral-based imports; the development of basic fertiliser minerals for regional agricultural sector, the regional rationalisation of the iron, steel and ferro-alloys sector to provide the basic inputs for an indigenous capital goods sector; the retention of further value-added in the region through cross-border mineral beneficiation and mineral transformation projects; the regional rationalisation of mining and mineral processing manpower training programmes; intra-regional cooperation in mineral exploration projects and the establishment of regional research and development facilities to localise mining technologies; the creation of mineral finance mechanisms that bring together the resources of the region allowing investment in major minerals development projects without resorting to the transnational companies; the development of a regional minerals fiscal and legislative regime to maximise the capture of mineral rents by the state and the establishment of a regional strategy towards the mining transnational corporations. However, to realise these regional objectives the SADCC will have to move on from its current project approach to greater trade integration with some form of currency convertibility. The project approach served the region well for the rehabilitation of the infrastructure, but for realisation of the full potential of the regional mineral sector as the basis for industrialisation, greater regional integration would be necessary...|$|E
40|$|The {{creation}} of ECOWAS in May 1975 marked the successful outcome of protracted negotiations {{that had begun}} shortly after independence, and which reflected the mounting sense of unease in Africa and throughout the Third World that political independence did not signify effective control by the new states of their economies. Hence the numerous experiments at integration within the region, some mainly political and others more economic in character. All, however, contributed to the movement towards regional economic integration and ECOWAS. The Ghana-Guinea Union attempted briefly to bridge the unfortunate linguistic and cultural divide separating former British and French territories In West Africa. The Union was restricted, however, to political cooperation between leaders with more or less compatible and radical ideologies, who were a small minority within {{the region as a}} whole. With independence the very number and diversity of West African states seemed to dictate a different and more gradual approach to unity based, initially, on economic cooperation and functional inter-dependence, and that has been the policy of every Nigerian government since 1960. If I have emphasised the role played by Nigeria, particularly after 1970, it is because international agencies and our future partners themselves recognised that, without Nigeria, there could be no effective West African community. By reason of its size, population and oil resources, Nigeria constitutes a core state, with no interest in territorial aggrandisement but concerned, understandably, with its own security and, therefore, with the stability of the region. These objectives are best served by policies of political cooperation, economic integration and adoption of a form of <b>collective</b> <b>self-reliance.</b> Here Nigeria's perception of its development and security needs has coincided increasingly with those of the other states within the region. Particular attention has been given to the Francophone states, who are the majority within West African and whose changing relationship with the metropole on the one hand, and with Nigeria on the other, is central to our analysis. The promise of the Ghana-Guinea Union was finally realised thanks to the growing cooperation after 1970 between Nigeria and Togo who, together, formed the nucleus of the West African community in 1972. Economic Integration in the 'seventies was also facilitated by (a) the reduced importance of ideological differences within the region; (b) the mounting economic difficulties confronting states {{as a result of the}} global economic crisis and increased oil prices after 1973, but alleviated by timely Nigerian assistance; (c) the example of regional integration within the EEC, soon to be expanded to include Britain; and (d) the successful outcome in 1975 of the Lome negotiations between the EEC and the African-Pacific-Caribbean states. The greater part of the thesis is concerned with the formation of ECOWAS and the negotiations, between July 1966 and May 1975, in which I was privileged to participate. While my own association with ECOWAS ended shortly afterwards, in July 1975, there was, fortunately, no such interruption in the development of the community. It seemed appropriate, therefore, to extend the scope of the thesis to encompass the first formative years of the community, 1975 - 1979, which saw the establishment of the principal ECOWAS institutions, the adoption of the more important protocols, and the first difficult steps towards their implementation...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the waves}} of {{globalisation}} that are roaring across the world, the older notion of 'regionalisation' is gaining favour amongst policy makers on all continents. This time, it appears that regionalisation is being promoted as a defensive reaction to the damage that unfettered globalisation is wreaking on weaker economies and societies. Increased regional cooperation, so people argue, could {{be a way to}} strengthen a sector, such as agriculture, before it is fully exposed to the world's market-place. But regionalisation in most ACP countries and regions has not become the powerful force predicted. Dreams can come true, but is regionalisation destined to remain an illusion? The Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), Rubens Ricupero, characterised regionalisation as 'An implicit 'insurance policy' for the developing countries in case globalisation and liberalisation produce undesirable consequences', and {{as one of the most}} hotly debated international topics in recent years. Of course, the topic does not concern developing countries alone. Quite the contrary, economic and political cooperation within Europe is still drawing the attention of people from all over the world. For developing countries, however, it may be more of a matter of life and death than it is for the rich, industrialised nations. For ACP countries it is especially relevant, as negotiations proceed on the future of the Lomé Convention. Regional integration in the South presented itself as an issue as early as three decades ago, but for a long time it was often more of an ambition than a political reality. How long, for instance, did it take the Organization of African Unity to prepare its members for an African Economic Community? (The Treaty establishing this Community finally entered into force in 1994.) In the Caribbean and the Pacific the sheer lack of infrastructure in itself was an enormous obstacle preventing integration from materialising. After all, most small nations in these regions had closer relations with former colonial powers overseas than with each other. In the current debate on regionalisation in the South a distinction is made between old and new regionalism. The former is considered to have been an aim in itself, when developing countries refused to join either party in the Cold War that was then raging. The latter is seen much more as an instrument, particularly in order to adjust in one way or another to the globalisation processes underway. At any rate regionalism is not just a matter of increasing trade, but has a clear security dimension and touches on development in the broadest sense of the word. An attractive strategy or the excluded In a conference on regional integration in November of last year in The Hague, Professor Björn Hettne of Sweden's University of Göteborg pointed out that the 'basic problem with globalisation is that it is uneven and selective'. As a result, he said, the benefits for some are balanced by misery, conflict and violence for others and in the longer run these negative features pose a threat to all humanity. Against the background of such uncertainties, regionalism is become a strategy to achieve security and development for those excluded by globalisation. Regionalism as a strategy is especially attractive to the so-called 'peripheral' regions, which are politically turbulent and economically stagnant. Their regional arrangements, however, reflect the weaknesses of their state structures and civil institutions. Here regionalism can only work once the nations involved have come to grips with domestic violence and poverty. No wonder they tend to interpret regionalism in a protectionist way. In 'intermediate regions' the character of regionalism is more open. These regions are at present closely linked to one of the three 'core regions', which are Europe, North America and East Asia. The nations in an intermediate region try to conform to the criteria of being part of a core region, which are sustained economic development and political stability. As they succeed in these efforts, they gradually get incorporated into the core. ACP countries constitute partly peripheral and partly intermediate regions. The Caribbean as a whole is considered to be part of an intermediate region that is becoming 'North Americanised', although the Mercosur bloc in the 'cone' of South America (which comprises Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) may put up some resistance to the neoliberalism prevalent in North America. In the Pacific, especially the southern part, there is a clear tendency of nations being drawn into the core region of East Asia, but at the same time this is counter-balanced by the risk of sinking into the periphery. Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), Southern and, to a lesser extent, West Africa have the potential to emerge as intermediate regions. William Lyakurwa, Deputy Director of the African Economic Research Consortium, Kenya, considers that 'There is a window of opportunity for sub-Saharan Africa to use regional integration as a supranational mechanism to foster national policy credibility, and as a means for pooling risks between otherwise vulnerable small economies; to resolve conflicts and minimise political risks; to exploit complementarities; and to develop regionally-based links on a reciprocal and mutually beneficial basis. ' A lot depends, however, on short-term developments in Eastern Africa, South Africa and Nigeria. The rest of SSA seems likely to remain in the periphery for an indefinite period of time. A fair chance to compete? In the North, the attitude towards regional cooperation in the South is generally positive, provided the governments of the South do not aim at achieving some sort of <b>collective</b> <b>self-reliance</b> in their respective regions. Integration of developing countries in the world economy has always been, and still is, the primary objective of the countries in the core regions, as the European Commission made clear in its Green Paper on relations between the European Union and the ACP countries on the eve of the 21 st century (1997). The big questions are: on what terms are developing countries allowed to feature more prominently on the world stage and which role shall be assigned to them? Are they really getting a chance of developing into equal partners, as the rhetoric from the dominant economic powers easily asserts? Or is globalisation merely designed to condemn them to a permanent second-rank position, where their primary functions are to serve as an outlet and dumping place for goods and services from the core regions, and as a source of relatively cheap inputs including manpower? For the time being the multilateral system, in which nearly all nations take part, is not working in favour of the poor countries. Recent developments in the fields of international finance have made it abundantly clear that the interests of the backbenchers in the world economy are not on the agenda of the powers that be and that even newly industrialising nations run the risk of being set back suddenly (e. g. the Asian crisis). These events once more point to the need for developing countries themselves to get their act together, which requires more effort than ever to make South-South cooperation work. More realistic food security An issue that is especially relevant to ACP countries is food security. So far, the advocates of globalisation and liberalisation have not been able to prove that their objectives are compatible with the basic need of food security on the lowest possible level. No wonder the South-North Centre in Lisbon clearly stated in a paper for the 1996 World Food Summit that 'at regional and inter-regional level greater South-South cooperation could contribute substantially to greater food security'. The strongest regional grouping within the ACP group, the Southern African Development Community (SADC), is well-known for the role it plays in regional food security. Percy S. Mistry, Chairman of the Oxford International Group: 'For the region to achieve and retain food self-sufficiency, the production of maize and other cereals must shift from the irrigated, semi-arid areas of the South African veldt to higher potential rain-fed areas further north in Angola, Zambia, northern Zimbabwe, Malawi, northern Mozambique and southern Tanzania, where regular rainfall is higher (despite droughts) as is soil fertility and water retention capacity. A regional rather than a national approach to this critical strategic challenge faced by SADC would permit the settlement of new land areas in a manner which reconciled meeting the food requirements of the region with the imperative of addressing thorny and urgent land reform and redistribution problems in South Africa and Zimbabwe. ' Better be sustainable The concept of sustainable development represents another example that underlines the need for regional integration. Again, the macro-economic policy twins of globalisation and liberalisation have never been seriously tested on their compatibility with this concept, as it was adopted by the world community in the 1992 Rio conference on environment and development. One feature of globalisation as it works at present is increasing mobility, of goods and people. The consequences for the environment are not incorporated in transportation costs, neither at the producer's nor the consumer's end. It would make sense to ensure that raw materials are ? at least partly ? processed as near the source as possible instead of being shipped to the other end of the world to be processed and returned again as finished products. Peter B. Robinson, Zimconsult, Zimbabwe: 'In the realm of natural resource management and tourism, properly conceived regional cooperation has considerable potential to contribute to sustainable growth'. In terms of environmentally-friendly criteria, regional integration is good in so far as it enables a group of countries to build a collective fully-fledged economy and change limited domestic markets into a large common market. Regional cooperation among groups of ACP countries is bound to be discussed, as the future relationship between them and the European Union takes shape. It is to be hoped that in this context the advantages of such cooperation in itself get sufficient attention, even though the political incentives are minimal. As Alieu Jeng, Principal Economist at the African Development Bank explains: 'It is easy for integration agreements to be violated because there is no constituency back home to whom the politician is accountable. He is not required to answer to his people and explain why he has opted out of an integration. To hold the politician accountable, the integration arrangement and the issues related to it have to be extensively discussed and the people have to be informed. ' No one should take for granted that regionalism must be a stepping stone to full integration in the world market. In fact, it could ? with commitment ? provide an alternative to the dogma of globalisation which, as all things mortal, will one day wither and die. Despite {{the waves of}} globalisation that are roaring across the world, the older notion of 'regionalisation' is gaining favour amongst policy makers on all continents. This time, it appears that regionalisation is being promoted as a defensive [...] ...|$|E
