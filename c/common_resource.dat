25|$|Scramble {{competition}} {{involves a}} more equal distribution of resources than contest competition and occurs {{when there is}} a <b>common</b> <b>resource</b> pool that an individual cannot be excluded from. For instance, grazing animals compete more strongly for grass as their population grows and food becomes a limiting resource. Each herbivore receives less food as more individuals compete for the same quantity of food.|$|E
40|$|<b>Common</b> <b>resources</b> are quasi-public resources, {{which are}} rivaled but non {{excludable}} in consumption or in appropriation.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{evolution}} of cooperation in the collective-risk social dilemma game, where the risk is determined by a collective target that must be reached with individual contributions. All players initially receive endowments from the available amount of <b>common</b> <b>resources.</b> While cooperators contribute part of their endowment to the collective target, defectors do not. If the target is not reached, the endowments of all players are lost. In our model, we introduce a feedback {{between the amount of}} <b>common</b> <b>resources</b> and the contributions of cooperators. We show that cooperation can be sustained only if the <b>common</b> <b>resources</b> are preserved but never excessively abound. This, however, requires a delicate balance between the amount of <b>common</b> <b>resources</b> that initially exist, and the amount cooperators contribute to the collective target. Exceeding critical thresholds in either of the two amounts leads to loss of cooperation, and consequently to the depletion of <b>common</b> <b>resources.</b> Comment: 5 two-column pages, 3 figures; accepted for publication in Scientific Report...|$|R

25|$|The way {{in which}} {{resources}} are partitioned by organisms also varies and can be split into scramble and contest competition. Scramble competition involves a relatively even distribution of resources among a population as all individuals exploit a <b>common</b> <b>resource</b> pool. In contrast, contest competition is the uneven distribution of resources and occurs when hierarchies in a population influence the amount of resource each individual receives. Organisms in the most prized territories or {{at the top of}} the hierarchies obtain a sufficient quantity of the resources, whereas individuals without a territory don’t obtain any of the resource.|$|E
25|$|In 1833, the English {{economist}} William Forster Lloyd {{published a}} pamphlet {{which included a}} hypothetical example of over-use of a <b>common</b> <b>resource.</b> This was the situation of cattle herders sharing a common parcel of land on which they are each entitled to let their cows graze, as was the custom in English villages. He postulated that if a herder put more than his allotted number of cattle on the common, overgrazing could result. For each additional animal, a herder could receive additional benefits, but the whole group shared damage to the commons. If all herders made this individually rational economic decision, the common could be depleted or even destroyed, {{to the detriment of}} all.|$|E
25|$|Hunting was {{associated}} with seasonal movements along trails and frozen rivers, particularly as bands moved between rivers and uplands. The primarily hunting animals for Tanana Athabaskans are big animals (caribou, moose, and wild sheep). Most valuable hunting animal is the caribou (subspecies Rangifer tarandus granti, Lower Tanana bedzeyh Tanacross wudzih Upper Tanana udzih). The caribou {{was the most important}} food animal in the Upper Tanana before the coming of the non-natives and resultant disintegration of the original nomadic patterns. The economic life of the Upper Tanana centers around the caribou. Not only does the animal constitute the source of food for the natives and their dogs, but also it supplies the material for their clothing, shelters, and boats as well as netting for their snowshoes and babiche and sinew for their snares, cords, and lashings. The caribou hunt occurred in the early summer and mid-summer. Caribou hunting during the fall migration involved the use of fence, corral, and snare complexes and was a seasonal activity critical to the survival of the Tanana people. Today, most caribou meat is typically used fresh, or is frozen for later use. The moose (subspecies Alces alces gigas, Lower Tanana denigi Tanacross dendîig Upper Tanana diniign) was other most important food animal for Tanana Athabaskans. Moose hunting is the most <b>common</b> <b>resource</b> harvesting activity among Lower Tanana Athabaskan bands. Moose hunting is always a popular activity in modern Athabaskan communities because of the meat's economic value and a food preference for large game. Moose hunting in the fall was either an individual pursuit or group activity. Moose meat was eaten fresh or preserved. The Mansfeld-Kechumstuk band of Tanacross employed several methods to hunt Dall sheep (in Alaskan English simply sheep, Lower Tanana deba Tanacross demee Upper Tanana dibee) in late summer and early fall in local mountainous areas or as far south as the Mentasta Mountains. Dall sheep were a desired source of food and material for clothing and tools.|$|E

2500|$|Much {{research}} has focused on when and why people would like to structurally rearrange the commons to prevent a tragedy. Hardin stated in his analysis of the tragedy of the commons that [...] "Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all." [...] One of the proposed solutions is to appoint a leader to regulate access to the common. Groups are more likely to endorse a leader when a <b>common</b> <b>resource</b> is being depleted and when managing a <b>common</b> <b>resource</b> is perceived as a difficult task. Groups prefer leaders who are elected, democratic, and prototypical of the group, and these leader types are more successful in enforcing cooperation. A general aversion to autocratic leadership exists, although it may be an effective solution, possibly because of the fear of power abuse and corruption.|$|E

In this paper, a model explores how {{the health of}} <b>common</b> pool <b>resources</b> could impact upon human capital outcomes for communities that struggle to find alternate livelihood options when traditional means such as agriculture become unsustainable. The management of <b>common</b> pool <b>resources</b> is modeled as a strategic interaction process between two heterogeneous communities that are directly or indirectly dependent upon it. An unconstrained harvesting of <b>common</b> <b>resources</b> such as forestry not only depletes its stocks, but it also indirectly affects crop output through soil degradation. A number of situations are constructed where communities are able to successfully finance human capital accumulation through proper management of their <b>common</b> pool <b>resources.</b> However, results also warn that communities that are faced with limited opportunities towards accumulating human capital must plan ahead to prevent the depletion of their <b>common</b> <b>resources</b> below critical levels.

They spoke of music, of which she knew far more than he; of foreign travel, where they met on common ground, for each had only the tourist's knowledge of Europe, and each was anxious for a more individual acquaintance with it.
