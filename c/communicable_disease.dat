5|$|The Government of India {{declared}} a national {{disaster in the}} aftermath of the cyclone, though international appeals were initially unanticipated. The destruction wrought by the cyclone was expected to cause a six-month-long total loss of normal livelihood. Damage sustained to various sanitation infrastructure led to a heightened risk of <b>communicable</b> <b>disease</b> outbreaks; indeed, diarrhea and cholera saw increased incidences following the storm's impact. Within a month of the cyclone's landfall, the Odishan government reported 22,296cases of diarrheal disorders. The area's vulnerability to disease was also compounded by a lack of pre-storm vaccinations, raising fears of a potential measles outbreak. The outbreak of diseases caused by the storm's effects stabilized by February2000. For most locations, the initial loss of telecommunication and rail operation was restored within a few days.|$|E

40|$|Background. Epidemiology of <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> is a {{preventive}} health activity whith {{the intention to}} prevent occurence and spreading of <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> between people. Department of epidemiology of the regional Institute of Public Health take care for the Dolenjska region (Lower Carniola). Methods of work are different {{and some of them}} are described in this article. Purpose of the article is also presentation of the <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> survey in the past 10 years in Dolenjska region (Lower Carniola) and comparison with the rest of the state. Conclusions. The basic activities which have a very important significance in prevention of incidence and prevalence of <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> are health education and advice. Both of them are very much involved in every process of epidemiology of <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases.</b> The quality of work depends on mutual cooperation with health workers from other health institutions of our region and elsewhere. </p...|$|R

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{controversy}} surrounding failed batches of polio vaccine threatened to destroy public {{faith in the}} Federal health establishment. After the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis sponsored a successful national trial of Jonas Salk's vaccine in Ann Arbor, Michigan (1954), PHS had released licensing standards for the vaccine and approved six manufacturers to begin production. Scheele and Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (DHEW) Secretary Oveta Culp Hobby released this long-awaited news {{at a press conference}} on April 12, 1955, the tenth anniversary of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's death from complications of polio. Health departments around the country administered over 10 million doses, 90 percent to elementary school-aged children, until weeks into the public health campaign, reports came in of fresh cases among vaccinated children and their contacts. Amid growing public furor, Scheele took action. On April 27 he requested that one of the manufacturers, Cutter Laboratories, recall its vaccine and he created a new Poliomyelitis Surveillance Unit at the <b>Communicable</b> <b>Disease</b> Center (CDC) and a national infrastructure for case reporting from the states. During May Scheele halted the national campaign until the remaining vaccines were cleared. Relative scarcity of the vaccine created public health crises of another sort: most vaccinations were held off until autumn, giving CDC time enough to evaluate the revised safety regulations but also leading to a political falling out between Hobby and the United States Congress.|$|E

[...] According to the CDC, MCWA [...] "was established to control malaria around military training bases in the southern United States and its territories, where malaria was still problematic".|$|E

[...] Schottlaender convinced her that she was [...] "compromised" [...] and that they must marry. [...] The next day, she was taken to Manchester, where they were married. The marriage was a terrible experience for Bond, and she became pregnant and ill. [...] "He ill-treated both my mind and my body, he denied me every comfort, often I had not even enough to eat. [...] To add to my wretchedness, the inevitable baby was coming. ... He had been violently ill-treating me, I was a broken, pitiful creature." [...] Her family persuaded her to leave him after ten months of marriage. Bond contracted smallpox from the doctor who attended her, but she recovered. The baby, Sidney John Arthur Schottlaender, was born on 7 May 1871 and died on 18 June 1871, six weeks later. The couple lived separately for several years, and Bond finally divorced her husband in 1874. Bond stated in her divorce petition that she had been knowingly infected with a <b>communicable</b> <b>disease</b> by her husband.|$|E

2500|$|According to American {{historian}} William O'Neill, [...] "Paralytic poliomyelitis (its formal name) was, if not {{the most}} serious, easily the most frightening public health problem of the postwar era." [...] He noted that the epidemics kept getting worse and its victims were usually children. By 1952, it was killing more of them than was any other <b>communicable</b> <b>disease.</b> In the 20 states that reported the disease back in 1916, 27,363 cases were counted. New York alone had 9,023 cases, of which 2,448 (28%) resulted in death, and a larger number in paralysis. However, polio did not gain national attention until 1921, when Franklin D. Roosevelt, former vice presidential candidate and soon to be governor of New York, came down with a paralytic illness, diagnosed {{at the time as}} polio. At the age of 39, Roosevelt was left with severe paralysis and spent most of his presidency in a wheelchair.|$|E
2500|$|Soon many monasteries {{were founded}} [...] {{throughout}} Europe, and everywhere there were hospitals like in Monte Cassino.

In the 6th–12th centuries the Benedictines established [...] lots of monk communities of this type. And later, in the 12th–13th centuries the Benedictines order built a network of [...] independent hospitals, initially to provide general care to the sick and wounded and then for treatment of syphilis and [...] isolation of patients with <b>communicable</b> <b>disease.</b> The hospital movement spread [...] through Europe in the subsequent [...] centuries, with a 225-bed hospital being [...] built at York in 1287 and even larger facilities established at Florence, Paris, Milan, Siena, and other medieval big European cities.|$|E

2500|$|The G-5 (Civil Affairs) branch {{had been}} {{established}} to handle the urgent issues created by the war on civilian populations. [...] The European populace became overrun so fast by invading armies that the destruction and disruption of civilian life and institutions became great enough to impede {{the progress of the}} fighting forces. [...] The primary objective of the G-5 was to further military effort by meeting emergency needs and maintaining civilian institutions. [...] General Draper would have an integral role in meeting this objective, using a staff which included competent specialists in the fields of <b>communicable</b> <b>disease</b> control, nutrition, sanitary engineering, public health nursing, narcotic drugs control, veterinary disease control, and general health inspection. Some of the specific health situations faced by General Draper and his staff were venereal disease, typhus brought about by louse infestations, typhoid fever, malnutrition, and the generally horrific living conditions endured by refugees and many people living under German occupation.|$|E
2500|$|With {{any large}} number of people being in close {{quarters}} there was a constant threat of disease. [...] When one individual in a large group gets sick with a <b>communicable</b> <b>disease,</b> it spreads to others very quickly. [...] This premise remains true even today in the modern military. [...] The Romans recognized the difference between disease and wounds, each requiring separate treatment. [...] Drainage of excess water and waste were common practices in camps as well as the permanent medical structures, which come at a later date. [...] As the medical corps grew in size there was also specialization evolving. Physicians surfaced that specialized in disease, surgery, wound dressing and even veterinary medicine. Veterinary physicians were there to tend to livestock for agricultural purposes as well as combat purposes. [...] The Cavalry was known for their use of horses in combat and scouting purposes. [...] Because of the type of injuries that would have been commonly seen, surgery was a somewhat common occurrence. [...] Tools such as scissors, knives and arrow extractors have been found in remains. [...] In fact, Roman surgery was quite intuitive, in contrast to common thought of ancient surgery. [...] The Roman military surgeons used a cocktail of plants, which created a sedative similar to modern anesthesia. [...] Written documentation also showed surgeons would use oxidation from metal such as copper and scrape it into wounds, which provided an antibacterial effect; however, this method was most likely more toxic than providing an actual benefit. [...] Doctors had the knowledge to clean their surgical instruments with hot water after each use. [...] Wounds were dressed, and dead tissue was removed when bandages were changed. [...] Honey and cobwebs were items used to cover wounds, and have even been shown today to increase healing. [...] Because of the wide array of cases, it was not uncommon for surgeons to begin their careers in the army to learn their trade. [...] Physicians such as Galen and Dioscorides served in the military. [...] Most major advancements in knowledge and technique came from the military rather than civil practice.|$|E
