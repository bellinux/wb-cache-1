50|$|During most {{of their}} history, silversmiths used {{charcoal}} or <b>coke</b> <b>fired</b> forges, and lung-powered blow-pipes for soldering and annealing. Modern silversmiths commonly use gas burning torches as heat sources. A newer method is laser beam welding.|$|R
50|$|Shortly after John Cockerill {{had built}} the first blast furnace in Belgium in Liege, he built a <b>coke</b> <b>fired</b> blast furnace in 1827 in Charleroi, 12m high and {{producing}} 6 to 10tonnes of pig iron a day.|$|R
50|$|The German chemist Robert Bunsen, {{who gave}} {{his name to}} the Bunsen burner in {{scientific}} experiments, was brought to Riddings in 1844 by Scottish scientist Professor Lyon Playfair to examine the behaviour of the <b>coke</b> <b>fired</b> blast furnaces.

50|$|The {{narrow gauge}} East Broad Top Railroad was {{constructed}} through {{the community in}} 1873. Rockhill {{was selected as the}} location of the railroad's maintenance facility. The parent company Rockhill Iron and Coal, located their dual-stack <b>coke</b> <b>fired</b> iron furnace here. Rockhill as it exists today was created by the coal company and the railroad as a support community for their infrastructure.|$|R
50|$|The {{business}} {{began as}} a wholesale and retail outlet on the Port Road in the town. The McKinney family began {{to make their own}} sweets and on 15 August 1927. The first sweets were made on the open <b>coke</b> <b>fire</b> in a shed {{at the back of the}} shop. The land on which the factory now stands was purchased in November 1929, the first sod was cut in February 1930. Six people were employed at the time.|$|R
25|$|Locomotives of Rockets era were <b>fired</b> by <b>coke</b> {{rather than}} coal. Local landowners were already {{familiar}} with the dark clouds of smoke from coal-fired stationary engines and had imposed regulations on most new railways that locomotives would 'consume their own smoke'. The smoke from a burning <b>coke</b> <b>fire</b> was much cleaner than that from coal. It was not until 30 years later {{and the development of}} the long firebox and brick arch that locomotives would be effectively able to burn coal directly.|$|R
5|$|In 1875, Edward Windsor Richards {{became the}} General Manager of the Middlesbrough Ironworks. Richards {{was in charge}} of the design and {{construction}} of the new plant at Eston, the Cleveland Steel Works. It had three <b>coke</b> <b>fired</b> haematite blast furnaces. Richards' work helped to improve the Bessemer process for making steel, in the case when the ore is rich in phosphorus, and an alkaline rock (dolomite, limestone or magnesite) is used. This variant is called the Gilchrist-Thomas process, after its inventor Sidney Gilchrist Thomas who persuaded Richards to adopt it.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} speculated that the {{beginnings}} of industrialised iron working around Charleroi may date at least to 1000AD, with water powered forge, and furnace fed by charcoal. The first {{official record of an}} iron industry dates to ~1600 By the 19th century the metallurgical inventions of the industrial revolution had reached Belgium; in the Charleroi area Paul-François Huart-Chapel would be instrumental {{in the development of the}} steel industry as his contemporary, the naturalised Belgian John Cockerill was in the nearby Liege area. In the 1820s he introduced puddling furnaces then <b>coke</b> <b>fired</b> blast furnaces.|$|R
50|$|In 1704 Jean Martin de Wendel {{bought an}} Ironworks in Hayange in Lorraine (region), {{north-eastern}} France. Over {{the next one}} hundred years industrial production grew, and, in 1822 the first <b>coke</b> <b>fired</b> blast furnace in France was constructed. Further growth occurred under de Wendel family ownership in the next century; in 1850 approximately 20,000 tons of iron and cast iron each were produced, by 1869 this had increased 15 blast furnaces and a production of well over 100,000 tons of cast iron and iron each. Production included rails, bars, sheet, tin and wire.|$|R
5000|$|In 1814 the {{brothers}} bought the former palace of the Prince Bishops of Liege at Seraing. The chateau became the plant headquarters {{and the ground}} behind it the factory site (founded 1817); it {{was to become a}} vertically integrated iron foundry and machine manufacturing factory. William I of the Netherlands was joint owner of the plant. A machine manufacturing plant was added in 1819, and in 1826 (begun 1823) a <b>coke</b> <b>fired</b> blast furnace. By 1840 the plant had sixteen steam engines producing total power [...] in continual work and employed 3000 persons.|$|R
50|$|The {{shell of}} the cupola, being usually made of steel, has {{refractory}} brick and plastic refractory patching material lining it. The bottom is lined {{in a similar manner}} but often a clay and sand mixture ("bod") may be used, as this lining is temporary. Finely divided coal ("sea coal") can be mixed with the clay lining so when heated the coal decomposes and the bod becomes slightly friable, easing the opening up of the tap holes. The bottom lining is compressed or 'rammed' against the bottom doors. Some cupolas are fitted with cooling jackets to keep the sides cool and with oxygen injection to make the <b>coke</b> <b>fire</b> burn hotter.|$|R
50|$|In 1836 the Englishman Thomas Bonehill built {{puddling}} furnaces for the Puissant and Licot de Nîmes families; in 1838 {{the company}} Société Anonyme des laminoirs, forges, fonderies et usines de la Providence {{was formed by}} Clément-Joseph Delbruyère together with Edmond et Jules Puissant and Thomas Bonehill with a permitted capital of 1500,000 francs in order to construct a <b>coke</b> <b>fire</b> blast furnace, together with other equipment from Puissant and Bonehill's company la société le grand laminoir de la Providence, including steam engines (50 and 80 hp), and metal working equipment including hammers, four rolling mills, shears, puddling furnaces, casting equipment and molds as well as associated land, workshops and offices, and refractory brick manufacturing facilities.|$|R
5000|$|The Iron Muse (A Panorama of Industrial Folk Song) {{arranged}} {{and produced}} by A. L. Lloyd is a thematic Industrial folk music album. [...] The featured singers and musicians are Anne Briggs, Bob Davenport, Ray Fisher, Louis Killen, A. L. Lloyd, Matt McGinn and The Celebrated Working Man's Band. John Tams considers it a Radio Ballad. The album was recorded at Champion's in Hampstead, London by Bill Leader and Paul Carter {{in an ad}} hoc studio {{set up in a}} large room. Colin Ross said that they had to wait for the <b>coke</b> <b>fire</b> to stop crackling before they could record the tracks. The album had a sleeve note commentary and a 4-page accompanying booklet with tune and song details, including lyrics, both written by A. L. Lloyd.|$|R
30|$|The {{other two}} {{pigments}} {{taken from the}} RCE-collection are red lead and lead white, which are both toxic as well. The lead white pigment was produced by the Dutch lead white factory in Schoonhoven de Kat. This company was founded in 1778 and became the largest lead white producing company in West-Europe in 1963 [53], but due to diminishing demand it had to close down in the 1990 ′s. The Schoonhoven company produced lead white according to the Dutch or stack-process whereby lead sheets are first exposed to acetic acid to form lead acetate and subsequently to carbonic acid and warmth, produced by horse manure, resulting in basic lead carbonate (lead white). In the 20 th century the procedure was somewhat adjusted for health safety reasons; the horse manure was replaced by <b>coke</b> <b>fire</b> and heating by a steam-boiler [54]. The red lead pigment was produced by the firm ‘Sikkens verkoop Nederland N.V.’, Sassenheim, The Netherlands. XRD-analysis proved the presence of lead tetroxide (red lead).|$|R
5000|$|Future nature writer Henry Williamson, then a nineteen-year-old private in the London Rifle Brigade, {{wrote to}} his mother on Boxing Day: [...] "Dear Mother, I am writing from the trenches.

In my mouth is a pipe presented by the Princess Mary. In the pipe is tobacco. Of course, you say. But wait. In the pipe is German tobacco. Haha, you say, from a prisoner or found in a captured trench. Oh dear, no! From a German soldier. Yes a live German soldier from his own trench.

60|$|The air of {{the room}} is almost bad enough to have {{extinguished}} it if he had not. It is a small room, nearly black with soot, and grease, and dirt. In the rusty skeleton of a grate, pinched at the middle as if poverty had gripped it, a red <b>coke</b> <b>fire</b> burns low. In the corner by the chimney stand a deal table and a broken desk, a wilderness marked with a rain of ink. In another corner a ragged old portmanteau {{on one of the}} two chairs serves for cabinet or wardrobe; no larger one is needed, for it collapses like the cheeks of a starved man. The floor is bare, except that one old mat, trodden to shreds of rope-yarn, lies perishing upon the hearth. No curtain veils the darkness of the night, but the discoloured shutters are drawn together, and through the two gaunt holes pierced in them, famine might be staring in--the banshee of the man upon the bed.|$|R
5|$|Prior to the United States' Civil War, Catholicism grew {{slowly in}} America, but afterward, {{it became more}} {{widespread}} as Catholic immigrants from eastern Europe moved to the four counties, which include Armstrong, Fayette, Indiana, and Westmoreland, to mine coal and produce <b>coke</b> to <b>fire</b> steel mills in Pittsburgh. This influx of Catholic immigrants resulted {{in the creation of}} more than 80 parishes and missions in the counties between 1865 and 1917.|$|R
50|$|An exact {{model of}} the outer bell, {{sometimes}} called a false bell, is built on a base-plate using porous materials such as coke, stone or brick. It is then covered first with sand or loam sometimes mixed with straw and horse manure. This is given a profile corresponding to the outside shape of the finished bell, and dried with gentle heat.The false bell is then covered with molten wax and figures and inscriptions, also made of wax, applied on top by hand. The false bell is painted over with three coats of fireproof clay and then enclosed by a steel mantle overcasing. The empty space between the false bell and the mantle is filled in with cement and left to harden before the mantle is lifted off. The false bell is chipped away from the inner core to leave just the wax and cement. Any leftover scraps of the false bell are removed with a blow torch. The mould is then set over a <b>coke</b> <b>fire</b> to melt the remaining wax and to evaporate any water that has accumulated.|$|R
5000|$|The {{introduction}} of the [...] "indirectly fired" [...] retort bench. The early [...] "directly fired" [...] retort bench consisted of retorts suspended over a <b>coke</b> <b>fire,</b> which heated the retorts and drove the carbonization of coal within to coke, {{and the evolution of}} gas. The {{introduction of}} indirect firing changed this. Instead of the retorts being heated directly by fire - the fire was placed a ways below and {{to one side of the}} retorts, brought to a very high heat, while the air supply was reduced and a small amount of steam introduced. Instead of evolving large quantities of heat to directly heat the retorts, the fire now evolved heated gasses - specifically carbon monoxide and due to the steam, a small amount of hydrogen as well, which are both highly combustible. These gasses rise from the fire into a channel which brings them to the [...] "tuyeres" [...] - small holes similar to [...] "nostrils", located adjacent to the retorts, which shoot the [...] "furnace-gasses" [...] out of them. Adjacent [...] "tuyeres" [...] emit a large amount of [...] "secondary air", which is preheated air, that, upon mixing with the furnace gasses, causes them to ignite and burst into flame and bathe the exterior of the retorts in heat.|$|R

50|$|In 1865, Coke was {{appointed}} a Texas District Court judge, and in 1866 {{he was elected}} as an associate justice to the Texas Supreme Court. The following year the military governor General Philip Sheridan <b>fired</b> <b>Coke</b> and four other judges as ‘an impediment to reconstruction’, in pursuit of unionist Reconstruction policies. The firing of the five judges became a cause célèbre and made their names famous, synonymous {{in the public eye}} with resistance to Union occupation.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 1970s {{there were}} very few collieries left in the area, and with the closure of Eden Colliery in 1980, Marley Hill, which had for some time been the last {{colliery}} in Gateshead, became one of the only three remaining collieres in the west of the coalfield. Although most of the seams were relatively thin, and therefore did not lend themselves easily to mechanisation, the high quality coking coal they yielded had ensured the colliery's longevity. However, a number of factors proved to be the colliery's undoing. The stationary engines which had powered the line shafting in workshops and factories had been ousted by the arrival of smaller and more efficient electric motors, and electric pumps had almost completely replaced large beam engines at water works. (Ironically, the coal mining industry {{had been one of the}} earliest to spot the potential advantages of electricity as a source of power- using it for everything from lighting to pumping to powering locomotives, thereby nurturing the technology that would one day play a significant part in its downfall.) British Rail's huge fleet of steam locomotives had gone by {{the end of the}} 1960s, and by the late 70s even the NCB's locomotive fleet consisted almost entirely of diesels. The decline of the steel industry greatly reduced the demand for coke and the exploitation of the North Sea oil and gas reserves and the resulting changeover of the domestic gas supply virtually eliminated any demand for coal gas. At around the same time, the gradual transition from coal and <b>coke</b> <b>fires</b> to gas central heating for domestic purposes was well under way, further reducing demand for coal. Although power stations still had an enormous appetite for coal, this could be easily met by the massive undersea mines in the east of the coalfield, as well as the large opencast sites in Northumberland. The writing was on the wall for smaller collieries like Marley Hill.|$|R
5000|$|Producer gas is {{fuel gas}} that is {{manufactured}} from material such as coal, {{as opposed to}} natural gas. In this respect it is similar to other types of [...] "manufactured" [...] gas, such as coal gas, coke oven gas, water gas and carburetted water gas. Producer gas was used primarily as an industrial fuel for iron and steel manufacturing, such as <b>firing</b> <b>coke</b> ovens and blast furnaces, cement and ceramic kilns, or for mechanical power through gas engines. It was characteristically low in heating value but cheap to make, so that large amounts could be made and burnt.|$|R
5000|$|The station {{initially}} {{noted as}} {{being at the}} end of a short stub off the two main lines following the opening of the route northwards, but a replacement through station was authorised by the S&D in September 1856; this was subsequently built & commissioned but the precise opening date was not recorded. [...] This only had the one (reversible) platform on a loop off the main line - a configuration that was used in several other locations on the S&D system (e.g. , [...] and Bishop Auckland itself), with a sizeable goods yard nearby that served the adjacent Pease's West Colliery, <b>coke</b> ovens, <b>fire</b> clay works and chemical plant. Another route to the town - the Deerness Valley Railway from Durham via Waterhouses was completed in January 1858 - this joined the WXR route just north of the town and was constructed by the S&D at the behest of Joseph Pease, whose company owned the colliery & associated Bank Foot industrial complex opposite the station. This route though was only used by goods traffic, as passenger trains terminated at Waterhouses throughout the line's existence (final closure occurring in December 1964).|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} project {{was carried out}} with the intension of producing high quality iron are pellets for iron making using processed Data (Rathnapura) iron ore and Aruwakalu lime is coke bed. Different pellet compositions were prepared by changing the percentage of Dela ore, lime and <b>coke</b> and thereafter <b>firing</b> them under different temperatures {{with the aim of}} obtaining required physical properties enabling its subsequent reduction to metallic iron. Reducibility of pellets at different temperatures were done by the packed coke bed crucible method developed by the authors, for those pellets which satisfied the required porosity and compression strength parameters. By observing the micro structure of specimen before reduction and after packed bed reduction, the quality of the pellets so produced was assed. This method may be adopted in the lab as a relatively cheap method to study reducibility of iron ores...|$|R
40|$|Investment {{casting process}} has been a widely used process for centuries. It {{is known for its}} ability to produce {{components}} of complex shapes with dimensional accuracy and excellent surface finish. Investment casting has been used to make manufacture weapons, jewellery and art castings during the ancient civilization and today it is used to manufacture engineering components. In Investment casting wax patterns are made by wax injection and then coating of the wax patterns are done by ceramic slurry, made with silica flour and binder. After dewaxing and firing molten metal is poured in the shell and solidified casting can be achieved. Investment casting can be cast any ferrous and non ferrous metal which is difficult in die casting. Finishing operations are negligible and very thin sections as. 75 mm can also be cast which is not possible in sand casting but there are many challenges in Investment casting. It is relatively slow process because preparation of ceramic shell consumes a lot of time, permeability of shell is very low which causes gas permeability. Incorporation of chills is very difficult. Among all these challenges gas porosity is main problem because of poor permeability, entrapment of gases due to complex geometry of the shell, reuse of scrap metal. In the present work porosity of the shell can be increase by addition of mixture of Camphor and needle <b>coke.</b> After <b>firing</b> of the shell camphor and needle coke will be burnt leaving pores for the escape of entrapped gases. Mechanical properties of the both shell will be compared with each other...|$|R
