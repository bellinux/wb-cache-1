2500|$|A {{country is}} {{regarded}} as polio free or non-endemic if no cases have been detected for a year. However, {{it is still possible}} polio circulates under these circumstances, as was the case for Nigeria, where a particular strain of virus resurfaced after 5 years in 2016. This can be due to limited surveillance and under-vaccinated populations. Moreover, for the currently <b>circulating</b> <b>virus</b> WPV1, only 1 in 200 infection cases exhibit symptoms of polio paralyses in non-vaccinated children, and possibly even fewer in vaccinated children. Therefore, even a single case is considered an epidemic. According to modeling, it can take 4 to 6 months of no reported cases to achieve only a 50% chance of eradication, and 1 to 2 years for e.g. 95% chance. [...] For a polio virus to be certified as eradicated world-wide, at least three years of good surveillance without cases needs to be achieved, though this period may need to be longer for a strain like WPV3, where a lower proportion of those infected demonstrate symptoms. [...] Wild poliovirus type 2 was certified eradicated in 2015, the last case having been detected in 1999. [...] Wild poliovirus type 3 has not been detected since 2012, but its eradication has yet to be certified, and the Global Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication in 2017 recommended not certifying its eradication independent of that of WPV1, and hence of wild poliovirus as a whole. [...] This recommendation would mean that PV3 will not be removed from the bivalent oral vaccine, as was considered necessary with PV2 due to its high risk of giving rise to cVDPV strains, but rather oral vaccination for PV3 will continue until total eradication of polio allows all oral vaccination to cease.|$|E
50|$|Reverse {{genetics}} plays a {{large role}} in vaccine synthesis. Vaccines can be created by engineering novel genotypes of infectious viral strains which diminish their pathogenic potency enough to facilitate immunity in a host. The reverse genetics approach to vaccine synthesis utilizes known viral genetic sequences to create a desired phenotype: a virus with both a weakened pathological potency and a similarity to the current <b>circulating</b> <b>virus</b> strain. Reverse genetics provides a convenient approach to the traditional method of creating inactivated vaccines, viruses which have been killed using heat or other chemical methods.|$|E

We conducted a test-negative case control study among subjects with influenza-like illness or acute respiratory tract infection consulting the Sentinel Practices over 11 influenza seasons (2003 / 2004 through 2013 / 2014) in the Netherlands. The adjusted IVE was estimated using generalized linear mixed modelling and multiple logistic regression.

40|$|AbstractThe {{global system}} for {{manufacturing}} seasonal influenza vaccines {{has been developed}} {{to respond to the}} natural evolution of influenza viruses, but the problem of antigenic mismatch continues to be a challenge in certain years. In some years, mismatches arise naturally due to the antigenic drift of <b>circulating</b> <b>viruses</b> after vaccine strain selection has already been made. In other years, antigenic differences between the vaccine <b>virus</b> and <b>circulating</b> <b>viruses</b> are introduced as part of the current system, which relies on the use of egg-adapted isolates as a starting material for candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs). Improving the current process for making vaccine viruses can provide great value. We have previously established a synthetic approach for rapidly generating influenza viruses in a vaccine-approved Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line using novel, high-growth backbones that increase virus rescue efficiency and antigen yield. This technology also has the potential to produce viruses that maintain antigenic similarity to the intended reference viruses, depending on the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) sequences used for gene synthesis. To demonstrate this utility, we generated a panel of synthetic viruses using HA and NA sequences from recent isolates and showed by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests that all synthetic viruses were antigenically-like their conventional egg- or cell-propagated reference strains and there was no impact of the novel backbones on antigenicity. This synthetic approach can be used for the efficient production of CVVs that may be more representative of <b>circulating</b> <b>viruses</b> and may be used for both egg- and cell-based vaccine manufacturing platforms. When combined with mammalian cell culture technology for antigen production, synthetic viruses generated using HA and NA sequences from a non-egg-adapted prototype can help to reduce the potential impact of antigenic differences between vaccine <b>virus</b> and <b>circulating</b> <b>viruses</b> on vaccine effectiveness...|$|R
50|$|Vaccines {{engineered}} from {{reverse genetics}} carry several advantages over traditional vaccine designs. Most notably is speed of production. Due {{to the high}} antigenic variation in the HA and NA glycoproteins, a reverse-genetic approach allows for the necessary genotype (i.e. one containing HA and NA proteins taken from currently <b>circulating</b> <b>virus</b> strains) to be formulated rapidly. Additionally, since the final product of a reverse genetics attenuated vaccine production is a live virus, a higher immunogenicity is exhibited than in traditional inactivated vaccines, which must be killed using chemical procedures before being transferred as a vaccine. However, due to the live nature of attenuated viruses, complications may arise in immunodeficient patients. There is also {{the possibility that a}} mutation in the virus could result the vaccine to turning back into a live unattenuated virus.|$|E
50|$|Unlike HIV-1 and HIV-2 {{infections in}} humans, SIV infections {{in their natural}} African simian {{non-human}} hosts appear in many cases to be non-pathogenic due to evolutionary adaptation of the hosts to the virus. Extensive studies in sooty mangabeys have established that SIVsmm infection does not cause any disease in these African primates, despite high levels of <b>circulating</b> <b>virus.</b> However, if the virus infects an Asian or Indian rhesus macaque, these non-African simian primates will also develop simian AIDS (SAIDS), as they, like humans (which although are also an African-origin simian primate species), {{have not had a}} prolonged history with the virus. A recent study of SIVcpz in wild living chimpanzees suggests that infected chimpanzees experience an AIDS-like illness similar to HIV-1 infected humans. The later stages of SIV infection turn into SAIDS, much as HIV infection turns into AIDS.|$|E
50|$|A common way {{to create}} a vaccine using reverse genetic {{techniques}} is to utilize plasmids to synthesize attenuated viruses. This technique is most commonly used in the yearly production of influenza vaccines, where an eight plasmid system can can rapidly produce an effective vaccine. The entire genome of the influenza A virus consists of eight RNA segments, so the combination of six attenuated viral cDNA plasmids with two wild-type plasmids allow for an attenuated vaccine strain to be constructed. For the development of influenza vaccines, the fourth and sixth RNA segments, encoding for the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins respectively, are taken from the <b>circulating</b> <b>virus,</b> while the other six segments are derived from a previously attenuated master strain. The HA and NA proteins exhibit high antigen variety, and therefore are taken from the current strain for which the vaccine is being produced to create a well matching vaccine.|$|E

In two patients, viral load declined during treatment and CXCR 4 -using virus was detected at day 11. No pretreatment factor predicted the emergence of CXCR 4 -tropic virus during maraviroc therapy in these two patients. Phylogenetic analysis of envelope (Env) clones from pre- and posttreatment time points indicated that the CXCR 4 -using variants probably emerged by outgrowth of a pretreatment CXCR 4 -using reservoir, rather than via coreceptor switch of a CCR 5 -tropic clone under selection pressure from maraviroc. Phylogenetic analysis was also performed on Env clones from a third patient harboring CXCR 4 -using virus prior to treatment. This patient was enrolled due to a sample labeling error.

Moreover, HLA-A 2 -restricted responses are largely absent in the acute phase of infection as the viral load is being reduced, suggesting that <b>circulating</b> <b>viruses</b> may lack immunodominant epitopes targeted through HLA-A 2. Here we demonstrate an A 2 -restricted epitope within Vpr (Vpr 59 - 67) that is targeted by acute-phase HIV- 1 -specific CD 8 + T cells, but only in a subset of persons expressing HLA-A 2. Individuals in the acute stage of infection with viruses containing the most common current sequence within this epitope (consensus sequence) were unable to mount epitope-specific T-cell responses, whereas subjects infected with the less frequent I 60 L variant all developed these responses. The I 60 L variant epitope was a stronger binder to HLA-A 2 and was recognized by epitope-specific T cells at lower peptide concentrations than the consensus sequence epitope. These data demonstrate that HLA-A 2 is capable of contributing to the acute-phase cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response in infected subjects, but that most currently <b>circulating</b> <b>viruses</b> lack a dominant immunogenic epitope presented by this allele, and suggest that immunodominant epitopes restricted by common HLA alleles may be lost as the epidemic matures...|$|R

Nearly two-thirds of viruses typed/subtyped were A(H 3 N 2) (394 / 626; 63 %); the remainder were A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09 (79 / 626; 13 %), B/Yamagata (98 / 626; 16 %) or B/Victoria (54 / 626; 9 %). Suboptimal VE of 50 % (95 %CI: 33 - 63 %) overall was driven by predominant H 3 N 2 activity for which VE was 41 % (95 %CI: 17 - 59 %). All H 3 N 2 field isolates were HI-characterized as well-matched to the WHO-recommended A/Victoria/ 361 / 2011 prototype whereas all but one were antigenically distinct from the egg-adapted strain as per actually used in vaccine production. The egg-adapted strain was itself antigenically distinct from the WHO-recommended prototype, and bore three AA mutations at antigenic sites B [H 156 Q, G 186 V] and D [S 219 Y]. Conversely, <b>circulating</b> <b>viruses</b> were identical to the WHO-recommended prototype at these positions with other genetic variation that did not affect antigenicity. VE was 59 % (95 %CI: 16 - 80 %) against A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09, 67 % (95 %CI: 30 - 85 %) against B/Yamagata (vaccine-lineage) and 75 % (95 %CI: 29 - 91 %) against B/Victoria (non-vaccine-lineage) viruses. These findings underscore the need to monitor vaccine viruses as well as circulating strains to explain vaccine performance. Evolutionary drift in <b>circulating</b> <b>viruses</b> cannot be regulated, but influential mutations introduced as part of egg-based vaccine production may be amenable to improvements...|$|R
