25|$|As Attorney General, Sessions {{overturned}} a memo {{delivered by}} predecessor Eric Holder that {{had sought to}} <b>curb</b> <b>mass</b> incarceration via avoiding mandatory sentencing, and has ordered federal prosecutors to begin seeking the greatest criminal charges possible. Sessions signed an order adopting civil asset forfeiture, which allows law enforcement to seize the property of those suspected but not charged with crimes, on the federal level. A staunch opponent of illegal immigration, Sessions has taken a hard-line on so-called sanctuary cities and has told reporters that cities failing to comply with federal immigration policy would lose federal funding. Sessions supports allowing the Department of Justice to prosecute providers of medical marijuana.|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, in the mid-1980s, Bond's {{work had}} a new {{beginning}} with the trilogy of The War Plays. Motivated by the threats of {{the last years of}} the Cold War and the political activism it provoked in Britain and Europe, Bond had planned to write about nuclear war since the early 1980s. He found a means to do so after testing a storyline with Sicilian students in Palermo. To point to the barbarity of a society which planned to kill the enemy's children to protect their own (that being how he saw the logic of nuclear deterrence), he suggested an improvisation in which a soldier was ordered to kill a child of his community to <b>curb</b> <b>mass</b> starvation. According to Bond, each student who improvised as the soldier refused to kill a foreign child and paradoxically returned home to kill their own sibling instead. He saw in this a deeply rooted force in the individual preserving an innate sense of justice that he theorized as 'Radical Innocence'. Subsequently, he built on this concept a comprehensive theory of drama in its anthropological and social role that he intended to go beyond Brecht's theories on political drama. This discovery also gave him the key to write on nuclear war, not to just to condemn the atrocity of war in a general way but, from a political perspective, questioning public acceptance of it and collaboration with it by ordinary citizens.|$|E

40|$|This study {{documents}} that lead weights, {{which are used}} to balance motor vehicle wheels, are lost and deposited in urban streets, that they accumulate along the outer curb, {{and that they are}} rapidly abraded and ground into tiny pieces by vehicle traffic. The lead is so soft that half the lead deposited in the street is no longer visible after little more than 1 week. This lead loading of urban streets by motor vehicle wheel weights is continuous, significant, and widespread, and is potentially a major source of human lead exposure because the lead is concentrated along the outer curb where pedestrians are likely to step. Lead deposition at one intersection in Albuquerque, New Mexico, ranged from 50 to 70 kg/km/year (almost 11 g/ft 2 /year along the outer <b>curb),</b> a <b>mass</b> loading rate that, if accumulated for a year, would exceed federal lead hazard guidelines more than 10, 000 times. Lead loading of major Albuquerque thoroughfares is estimated to be 3, 730 kg/year. Wheel weight lead may be dispersed as fugitive dust, flushed periodically by storm water into nearby waterways and aquatic ecosystems, or may adhere to the shoes of pedestrians or the feet of pets, where it can be tracked into the home. I propose that lead from wheel weights contributes to the lead burden of urban populations. Key words: antimony, antimoniou...|$|R
50|$|Not surprisingly, Tsur {{is equally}} keen {{to find out}} how {{contacts}} between European and non-European within the Jewish polity have been transformed during the Zionist era, {{as well as on the}} ground in Jewish Palestine. Accordingly, he finds complexity where more rigid post-colonial minded scholars would prefer to concentrate solely on rigid dichotomies. According to Tsur's findings, if in the pre-state Yishuv Zionist technocrats were already directing non-European arrivals to fulfill menial roles and peripheral niches, all the more so when already in 1949 Ashkenazi spokesmen sounded doomsday warnings of how the Western seeming success story of the New Hebrew state would be permanently damaged by the Asiatic hordes now nocking at Israel's doors.To be sure, previous (and mostly apologetic) interpretations of the <b>curbing</b> of the <b>mass</b> Aliyah from French North Africa, first and foremost Morocco, by means of a medical selective process and series of quotas, rested solely on economic considerations that had been articulated by representative bodies of the absorbing apparatus such as relevant departments of the Jewish agency. Tsur, however, has successfully examined things afresh and introduced into the equation naked cultural fears, and even panic publicly voiced by the Ashkenazi leadership of the Jewish state. He has originally tracked the subsequent history of Israeli ethnic strife as being a two-sided conflict; occasionally exacerbated discretely by the Ashkenazi elite (1949 and 1984) and in other times (1959 and 1971) openly ignited by the Mizrahi subaltern class.|$|R
