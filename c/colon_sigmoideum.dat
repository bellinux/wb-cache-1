40|$|As it {{is known}} aldosteron stimulates the {{transepithelial}} natrium- resorption in colon and kidney. In human <b>colon</b> <b>sigmoideum</b> it has been shown, that the expression of claudin- 8, which functions as a cation-barrier, is upregulated during aldosteron- stimulated Enac- induction. This effect only can be observed, if Enac is not only induced but also active. This means, that natrium- abdorption defends from paracellular back- leakage by claudin- 8 upregulation, which is an important mechanism to support the high transepithelial natrium-gradient in human colon under stimulation with aldosteron...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the metabolic enzymatic {{capacity of the}} colon mucosa to detoxify noxious carcinogenic compounds. METHODS: We investigated the activity of 2 conjugating enzymes-the microsomal uridine glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and the cytosomal glutathione S-transferase (GST) in the uninvolved mucosa of the <b>colon</b> transversum and <b>sigmoideum</b> in patients with adenomatous polyps and colorectal cancer. Biopsies {{were taken from the}} mucosa during colonoscopies which were done for clinical (diagnostic) reasons. After storage, the biopsy material was homogenized and after differential centrifugation the enzyme assays were performed with 4 -nitrophenol (UGT) and 1 -chloro 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene (GST) as substrates. RESULTS: About 48 patients were included of which 28 had adenomas and 20 had colorectal carcinomas confirmed by histopathology. Enzyme activities were expressed as nmol/mg per minute protein for the GST and as pmol/mg per minute protein for the UGT. Analysis of variance (F-test) indicated that both enzymes were more widely distributed in adenoma than in cancer patients. The means 1; SD were smaller for cancer patients: GST for adenomas 268 1; 152 vs 241 1; 69 for carcinomas and UGT for adenomas 197 1; 200 vs 150 1; 86 for carcinomas. CONCLUSION: Compared to patients with adenomatous colon polyps those with colorectal carcinoma exhibited a lower capacity of detoxifying enzyme metabolism and their activities clustered over a smaller range...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} the expression levels and correlations among the expressions of transforming growth factor-β 1 (TGF-β 1), Runx 3 and CD 83 in colonic mucosal specimens from IBS patients. MethodsA total of 40 patients were selected, who were confirmed as IBS by Rome III standard and 40 healthy volunteers served as control. Colonic mucosal specimens of each subject {{were collected from}} <b>colon</b> <b>sigmoideum</b> with biopsy forceps. Runx 3, TGF-β 1, and CD 83 (the marker for immunecompetent mature dendritic cells (DCs) mRNA in the sigmoid colon tissue were measured by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR. ResultsCompared with the control group, CD 83 mRNA expressions were higher in patients with IBS than in healthy controls (P 0. 05). ConclusionsThe increase of abnormal dendritic cells might influence the occurrence and development of IBS. TGF-β 1 signal pathway might not be involved in Runx 3 -regulated maturation of dendritic cells in IBS...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{mechanically}} induced vibration upon the human abdomen {{were determined by}} measuring the presmre in the rectal end of the <b>colon</b> <b>sigmoideum.</b> A technique was developed for transmitting the internal pressure to external recorders, and the amplitudes of the colon pressure flucfua tions were determined, when eight human subjects and one Rhesus monkey were subjected to vertical sinusoidal Vibration, at vector acceferafions of less than one g, in the frequeny range of one through twenty CIS. The pressure fluctuations were found to vary with frequency, Jhowing maximum mean “peak i o peak ” pressure, per one g acceleration, of 57 mmHg ot 4. 5 c]s and 4 CIS, sitting erect and sifting relaxed; and 30 mmHg at 7 61 s in the semi-supine posture of buman subjects. These resonances confirm the results of relatedprior studies {{of the human body}} as a mechanical ysfem...|$|E
40|$|Background—In several {{diseases}} {{there is}} a relation between deficiency of neutrophil granulocytes and granulomatous lesions. Recently, in glycogen storage disease type Ib, this relation has been supported by the beneficial effect of treatment of enteritis with granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor.  Aim—To investigate whether chronic granulomatous disease could be treated according to the same principle.  Patients and methods—Inflammatory lesions were monitored in two brothers with chronic granulomatous disease demonstrated by very low superoxide production in neutrophil granulocytes. The two patients were treated with recombinant human {{granulocyte colony stimulating factor}} on three occasions when the disease was active.  Results—In one patient, remission of an inflamed stenosis of the <b>colon</b> <b>sigmoideum</b> was shown by granulocyte scintigraphy after one month of treatment with granulocyte colony stimulating factor. In the other patient, remission of colon disease and later of a non-malignant tumour in the right lung hilum was shown by colonoscopy and computed tomography scans respectively.  Conclusion—Remission of inflammatory lesions in two brothers with chronic granulomatous disease was induced by granulocyte colony stimulating factor on three occasions. The mechanism for this effect is not known. The result is similar to the response found in patients with leucocyte deficiency due to glycogen storage disease type Ib. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis for a {{postdoctoral}} lecture qualification {{focuses on}} functional characterization of tight junction proteins, analysis of induction of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), and {{identification of a}} synergistic regulation of transport and barrier in <b>colon</b> <b>sigmoideum.</b> Claudin- 2 acts as a paracellular cation channel, claudin- 5 tightens the barrier, and claudin- 16 mediates magnesium permeability. Mutations of claudin- 16, which has been associated to familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalcuria and nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC) directly result in a dysfunction of the protein in an epithelial cell model. In addition, the molecular basis for the tight barrier of stria vascularis marginal cells was identified. Analysis of the regulation of the epithelial sodium channel ENaC in distal colon of the rat revealed that aldosterone initially induces transcription of beta and gamma subunits. The use of selfsame tissues showed that ENaC induction in distal colon can be explained on transcriptional level alone. In addition, an inhibition of ENaC in inflamed colon of patients with ulcerative colitis was observed. In healthy colon of rat and man an inhibitory effect of proinflammatory cytokines on ENaC was identified. Moreover, a direct functional link between regulation of ion transport and paracellular sealing was observed: During induction of electrogenic sodium transport, a tightening of the paracellular pathway prevents a back-leak of sodium into the lumen, thereby increasing efficiency of sodium transport...|$|E
40|$|Diverticulosis and the in 1 / 3 {{following}} diverticulitis increases significantly. At {{the age of}} 40 10 % of {{the population}} are concerned by diverticulosis. This number increases up to 60 % {{at the age of}} 80. Occasionally for the development are the nutrition and changing’s in the colonic wall. There are several possibilities for staging diverticular disease. Most common are the classifications of Hinchey and Hansen and Stock. The diverticular disease can be uncomplicated or complicated. On can treat the diverticular disease conservative or by surgery. In this study every patient who was on the ward between 01. 01. 2002 to 01. 06. 2005 in Klinikum Benjamin Franklin was included. We sent everyone 2 questionnaires. 1 to document the state of health before medical treatment and 1 to document the state of health after medical treatment. 59 % of our patients sent back the questionnaires (147 patients). We found out that there are persistent symptoms after diverticular disease. Before acute illness our entire patient felt pain or tension in the left lower quadrant. Some had flatulence or obstipation. Pain or tension in the left lower quadrant are guiding for diverticulosis. Coloscopy or CT should be arranged. In case of diverticulosis the benefit of balanced feeding should be explained. In most cases discomforts occurred for some days. This might be a symptom of a milder diverticular disease. People with more discomforts needed more often surgery than those without discomforts. In most cases diverticulosis was diagnosed several years ago. The conservative therapy is effective at the stage I or II a Hansen and Stock. It can be reached well-being as good as by surgery. The guidelines of AECS (American Society of Endoscopic Surgery) tell the need of surgery in case of complicate diverticultis. 82 % of our patients had no need of further therapies after conservative treatment during the Follow Up of 26 month (+ 21 month). This fact means that they are treated right. Most patients recovered well after surgery. It took 6 weeks after laparoscopic surgery and 8 weeks after open surgery. 2 / 3 had no discomforts during the Follow Up. 26 % had discomforts after laparoscopic surgery and 29 % after open surgery. The long-term Follow up of both methods is equal. After surgery and significant increase of bowel habits occurred. Patients also told us a softer and more liquid consistence. The reason for this changing is the resection of the <b>colon</b> <b>sigmoideum.</b> Significant more older patients told us about problems in keeping urine. Also significant more patients who took part in open surgery complained about this problem. In this group older people are in majority. This is a possibly reasonable for this result. Because we did no urodynamic examination a statement is not possible. Sexual problems were documented also. A less of patients answered these questions. A statement is not possible. After the medical treatment the recovery is not finished. It needs some time at home to. Persistent symptoms are possible. To sum up the comparison of CT and histology: CT is a reliable examination method. The diagnosis of perforation was right in most cases. In daily life it is important if there is stage IIb or IIc Hansen and Stock. Divergences are mostly understandable. If there is time between these two examinations a deviation must occur. In between a conservative or interventionell therapy took part. A less stage has to be the result. If there is a higher stage a progress of disease is possible. An incorrect diagnosis of radiologist is possible to. A difference result of CT and histology must occur if there is some time between them...|$|E
