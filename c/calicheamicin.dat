5|$|The strongest {{argument}} against the poison theory {{is the fact that}} twelve days passed between the start of his illness and his death; such long-acting poisons were probably not available. However, in a 2003 BBC documentary investigating the death of Alexander, Leo Schep from the New Zealand National Poisons Centre proposed that the plant white hellebore (Veratrum album), which was known in antiquity, may have been used to poison Alexander. In a 2014 manuscript in the journal Clinical Toxicology, Schep suggested Alexander's wine was spiked with Veratrum album, and that this would produce poisoning symptoms that match the course of events described in the Alexander Romance. Veratrum album poisoning can have a prolonged course and it was suggested that if Alexander was poisoned, Veratrum album offers the most plausible cause. Another poisoning explanation put forward in 2010 proposed that the circumstances of his death were compatible with poisoning by water of the river Styx (modern-day Mavroneri in Arcadia, Greece) that contained <b>calicheamicin,</b> a dangerous compound produced by bacteria.|$|E

50|$|Micromonospora echinospora is {{a species}} of {{bacteria}} that is known for producing the enediyne antibiotic <b>calicheamicins.</b>|$|R
25|$|The <b>calicheamicin</b> {{types are}} defined by a methyl trisulfide group that is {{involved}} in triggering the molecule by the following mechanism.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, <b>calicheamicin</b> {{is able to}} cleave DNA at low concentrations, {{proving to}} be up to 1000 times more {{effective}} than adriamycin at combating certain types of tumors. In all cases, cells lack the ability to repair double-stranded DNA breaks, making these compounds especially effective for treating tumor cells.|$|E
25|$|Substituted {{derivatives}} of hydroxylamine are known. If the hydroxyl {{hydrogen is}} substituted, {{this is called}} an O-hydroxylamine, {{if one of the}} amine hydrogens is substituted, this is called an N-hydroxylamine. Similarly to ordinary amines, one can distinguish primary, secondary and tertiary hydroxylamines, the latter two referring to compounds where two or three hydrogens are substituted, respectively. Examples of compounds containing a hydroxylamine functional group are N-tert-butyl-hydroxylamine or the glycosidic bond in <b>calicheamicin.</b> N,O-Dimethylhydroxylamine is a coupling agent, used to synthesize Weinreb amides.|$|E
50|$|It {{consists}} of the humanized monoclonal antibody against CD22 (inotuzumab), linked to a cytotoxic agent from the class of <b>calicheamicins</b> called ozogamicin.|$|R
5000|$|Gemtuzumab is a {{monoclonal}} antibody to CD33 {{linked to a}} cytotoxic agent from the class of <b>calicheamicins.</b> CD33 is expressed in most leukemic blast cells but also in normal hematopoietic cells, the intensity diminishing with maturation of stem cells.|$|R
5000|$|Inotuzumab {{ozogamicin}} {{consists of}} the humanized monoclonal antibody inotuzumab (against CD22), linked to a cytotoxic agent from the class of <b>calicheamicins</b> called ozogamicin. [...] Ozogamicin is N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide. [...] It includes the same linker, called [...] "AcBut", and toxin, as gemtuzumab ozogamicin, which arose from the same collaboration. [...] The linker is a carbonyl-containing carboxylic acid.The antibody, originally called G5/44, was created by grafting the complementarity-determining regions and some framework residues from the murine anti-CD22 mAb m5/44, onto human acceptor frameworks.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Calicheamicin</b> {{and other}} related {{compounds}} share several common characteristics. [...] The extended structures attached to the enediyne allow the compound to specifically bind DNA, in most cases to the minor groove of the double helix. [...] Additionally, part of the molecule {{is known as the}} “trigger” which, under specific physiological conditions, activates the enediyne, known as the “warhead” and 1,4-didehydrobenzene is generated.|$|E
2500|$|Most enediynes, {{including}} the ones listed above, {{have been used}} as potent antitumor antibiotics due to their ability to efficiently cleave DNA. [...] <b>Calicheamicin</b> and esperamicin are the two most commonly used types due to their high specificity when binding to DNA, which minimizes unfavorable side reactions. They {{have been shown to be}} especially useful for treating acute myeloid leukemia.|$|E
2500|$|Dynemicin and its {{relatives}} {{are characterized by}} the presence of an anthraquinone and enediyne core. [...] The anthraquinone component allows for specific binding of DNA at the 3’ side of purine bases through intercalation, a site that is different from <b>calicheamicin.</b> [...] Its ability to cleave DNA is greatly increased in the presence of NADPH and thiol compounds. [...] This compound has also found prominence as an antitumor agent.|$|E
30|$|Another {{important}} consideration is {{the limited number}} of payload molecules that can be efficiently delivered into target cells. Only 1.56 % of administered drug molecules can enter target cells if the efficiency of each step in the ADC mechanism is assumed to be 50 % (biodistribution, binding to antigen, internalization, release of payload, intracellular stability of payload, and payload binding to target) (Teicher and Chari, 2011). Indeed, the actual uptake is estimated to be much lower than this assumption (< 0.01 % injected dose per gram of tumor) (Sedlacek et al., 1992). Thus, to maximize treatment efficacy using ADCs, cytotoxic potency of payload is required to be high enough to effectively eradicate target cells, ideally in the picomolar range. While important to select highly potent toxic agents as payload, ideal agents have inherent selectivity for target cancer cells. Certain types of noncancerous cells may be capable of internalizing ADCs through nonspecific pinocytosis or fragment crystallizable (Fc) region receptor-mediated endocytosis (Lencer and Blumberg, 2005). Furthermore, payload may be released upon degradation into circulating blood. Thus, payloads have primarily been selected based on the above-mentioned consideration; antimitotic agents, which are generally less toxic to noncancerous cells than to cancerous cells, are payloads that have been mainly used in the FDA-approved ADCs and ADCs in clinical trials. In addition to <b>calicheamicins</b> (used in Mylotarg®), auristatins (used in Adcetris®), and maytansinoids (used in Kadcyla®), new classes of highly potent antimitotic compounds have also been explored for ADC payloads: duocarmycins, pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimers (PBDs), amanitins, and tubulysin analogs are such examples (Chari et al., 2014; Perez et al., 2014).|$|R
2500|$|Enediynes {{are present}} in many {{complicated}} natural products. [...] They were originally discovered in the early 1980s during a search for new anticancer products produced by microorganisms. <b>Calicheamicin</b> {{was one of the}} first such products identified and was originally found in a soil sample taken from Kerrville, Texas. [...] These compounds are synthesized by bacteria as defense mechanisms due to their ability to cleave DNA through the formation of 1,4-didehydrobenzene from the enediyne component of the molecule.|$|E
2500|$|Alkynes {{occur in}} some pharmaceuticals, {{including}} the contraceptive noretynodrel. A carbon–carbon triple bond is {{also present in}} marketed drugs such as the antiretroviral Efavirenz and the antifungal Terbinafine. Molecules called ene-diynes feature a ring containing an alkene ("ene") between two alkyne groups ("diyne"). These compounds, e.g. <b>calicheamicin,</b> {{are some of the}} most aggressive antitumor drugs known, so much so that the ene-diyne subunit is sometimes referred to as a [...] "warhead". Ene-diynes undergo rearrangement via the Bergman cyclization, generating highly reactive radical intermediates that attack DNA within the tumor.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Calicheamicin</b> {{displays}} unbiased toxicity to bacteria, fungi, viruses, and eukaryotic {{cells and}} organisms, which raises {{questions as to}} how the calicheamicin-producing Micromonospora manages not to poison itself. An answer to this question was presented in 2003 when Thorson and coworkers presented the first known example of a [...] "self-sacrifice" [...] resistance mechanism encoded by the gene calC from the <b>calicheamicin</b> biosynthetic gene cluster. In this study, the scientists revealed <b>calicheamicin</b> to cleave the protein CalC site-specifically, destroying both the <b>calicheamicin</b> and the CalC protein, thereby preventing DNA damage. The same group went on to solve the structure of CalC and, more recently, in collaboration with scientists from the Center for Pharmaceutical Research and Innovation (CPRI), discover structural or functional homologs encoded by genes in the <b>calicheamicin</b> gene cluster previously listed as encoding unknown function. In this latter study, the authors suggest that CalC homologs may serve in a biosynthetic capacity as the long-sought-after polyketide cyclases required to fold or cyclize early intermediates en route to <b>calicheamicin.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The calicheamicins are a {{class of}} enediyne {{antitumor}} antibiotics derived from the bacterium Micromonospora echinospora, with <b>calicheamicin</b> γ1 being the most notable. It was isolated originally in the mid-1980s from the chalky soil, or [...] "calichi pits", located in Kerrville, Texas. The sample was collected by a scientist working for Lederle Labs. It is extremely toxic to all cells and, in 2000, a CD33 antigen-targeted immunoconjugate N-acetyl dimethyl hydrazide <b>calicheamicin</b> was developed and marketed as targeted therapy against the non-solid tumor cancer acute myeloid leukemia (AML). <b>Calicheamicin</b> γ1 and the related enediyne esperamicin are the {{two of the most}} potent antitumor agents known.|$|E

5000|$|The Bergman {{cyclization}} {{proved to}} be even more important with the discovery of enediyne [...] "cytostatics", compounds able to cleave double-stranded DNA. One example of enediyne cytostatic is <b>calicheamicin,</b> which in cell reveals a 1,4-didehydrobenzene moiety. The ability of substituted 1,4-didehydrobenzene to abstract hydrogen atoms from DNA is thought to be a key step in the biological activity of the potential antitumor/antibiotic enediyne drugs, such as <b>calicheamicin.</b> However, enediyne molecules tend to be very reactive and nonselective, making them poor drug candidates. Computational chemistry helped predict the behavior of 1,4-didehydrobenzene analogues that in future might help produce a drug candidates with ameliorated reactivity and high selectivity.|$|E

Among the {{molecules}} synthesized by Danishefsky at Columbia University are epothilones and <b>calicheamicin,</b> which are natural products with promise as anti-cancer agents.|$|E
5000|$|The esperamicins are chromoprotein enediyne {{antitumor}} antibiotics {{of bacterial}} origin. Esperamicin A1 {{is the most}} well studied compound in this class.

50|$|In 2014 it was {{claimed that}} Alexander the Great {{could have been}} {{poisoned}} by a wine made from Veratrum album. Previously, {{it was believed that}} poisoning due to arsenic or the water of the river Styx (modern-day Mavroneri in Arcadia, Greece) that contained <b>calicheamicin,</b> a dangerous compound produced by bacteria, may have led to the death of the King of Macedon.|$|E
50|$|Glycosylation of calicheamicinone {{requires}} 4 glycosyltransferases (CalG1-4) and one acyltransferase (CalO4), each recognizing {{a specific}} sugar nucleotide or orsellinic acid substrate. Ground-breaking biochemical studies of CalG1-G4 by Thorson and coworkers revealed the reactions catalyzed by these glycosyltransferases {{to be highly}} reversible. This was a paradigm shift {{in the context of}} glycosyltransferase catalysis and Thorson and coworkers went on to demonstrate this to be a general phenomenon that could be exploited for sugar nucleotide synthesis and 'glycorandomization'. The structures of all four glycosyltransferases were also reported by the same group, revealing a conserved <b>calicheamicin</b> binding motif that coordinates the enediyne backbone thorough interactions with aromatic residues. The catalytic site of CalG1, CalG3, and CalG4 was shown to possess a highly conserved catalytic dyad of histidine and aspartate which promotes nucleophilic attack on the acceptor hydroxyl group of <b>calicheamicin</b> intermediates. Notably, this motif is absent from CalG2, suggesting a different catalytic mechanism in this enzyme.|$|E

This diradical, 1,4-didehydrobenzene, then abstracts hydrogen atoms from the deoxyribose (sugar) backbone of DNA, which ultimately leads to strand scission. The specificity of binding of <b>calicheamicin</b> to the minor groove of DNA was demonstrated by Crothers et al. (1999) {{to be due to}} the aryltetrasaccharide group of the molecule.|$|E
