25|$|On June 15, 2005, hackers {{disassembled}} {{the code}} of the PSP and distributed it online. Initially the modified PSP allowed users to run <b>custom</b> <b>code</b> and {{a limited amount of}} protected software. Sony responded to this by repeatedly upgrading the software.Homebrew were custom made PSP applications consisting of different types of features including calculator, remote, file manager, android simulator etc. Over time people were able to unlock the firmware and allow users to run more custom content and more protected software. One of the ways hackers were able to run protected software on the PSP was through the creation of ISO loaders which could load copies of UMD games from the memory stick. Custom firmware is also commonly seen in the PSP systems; the most famous ones include the M33 Custom Firmware, Minimum Edition (ME/LME) CFW and the PRO CFWl.|$|E
500|$|Nihilistic {{initially}} {{looked at}} existing game engines {{such as the}} Quake engine and Unreal Engine, but decided those engines, which were primarily designed for first-person shooters, would not be sufficient for its point-and-click driven RPG and decided to create its own engine for development of Redemption. This was the NOD engine, which the developers could customize for the game's 3D perspective and role-playing mechanics. The team also considered that developing its own engine would allow it to freely reuse code for future projects or to license the engine for profit. NOD was prototyped using the Glide application programming interface (API) because the team believed {{it would be more}} stable during the engine's development, intending that once the engine was more complete, it would be moved to a more general API designed to support a wide range of hardware such as Direct3D. However, once a basic engine was in place in Glide, the programmers turned their attention to gameplay and functionality. By June 1999, Redemption was still running in Glide, which at that point lacked some of the basic features the team needed to demonstrate at that year's Electronic Entertainment Expo. When the team eventually switched to Direct3D, it was forced to abandon some <b>custom</b> <b>code</b> it had built to compensate for Glide's limitations such as texture and graphic management, which required the re-exporting of hundreds of levels and models for the new software. The late API switch also limited the time available to test the game's compatibility {{on a wide range of}} hardware. The team focused on building the game for hardware accelerated systems to avoid the limitations of supporting a wider range of systems, which had restricted the development of the company founders' previous game, [...] (1997).|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} article author {{analyzes}} the institutional framework of the Customs Union of the EU and the modernized <b>Customs</b> <b>Code</b> of the EU. Since {{the establishment of the}} European Economic Community in 1957 the Customs Union became the main aim of proximal development of the integration process, because without the customs union was not possible to form a common market, establishment of which was at that time the main task of the European Economic Community. The EU Customs Union formed gradually with the deepening integration, so all the difficulties of the European integration process have left their imprint on the formation of the customs union. In the study author notes that issues related to the decision-making mechanism in the field of customs cooperation defined in acts of primary EU law, because the order of the ordinary legislative procedure prescribed in detail in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Author also notes that the special position among the rules to modernize the EU <b>Customs</b> <b>Code</b> occupies rules aimed at regulating the customs debt and guarantees. The provisions of the new <b>Customs</b> <b>Code</b> (Section 3 of the modernized <b>Customs</b> <b>Code</b> EU) cover the following stages of the free movement of goods within the European Union. In conclusion, author notes that all matters relating to customs policy of the European Union are regulated in the founding treaties and the rules of the <b>Customs</b> <b>Code</b> only detail the provisions of the EU founding treaties. Author also concludes that the application of the modernized <b>Customs</b> <b>Code</b> of the European Union outside the context of the founding treaties of the European Union is impossible...|$|R

It revokes the old Community <b>Customs</b> <b>Code</b> (CCC), which was applied since 1992, and passed {{in the form of}} EU regulation sets brand-new rules for the application of Common Customs Tariff and calculation of customs duties (tariffs) in all the EU Member States.

Therefore, the article raises and seeks to answer the problematic question whether the Member States of the European Union themselves are ready to implement these ambitious goals and does the actual practice of the Member States support that (considering the practice of the Republic of Lithuania). The research, which is based on the analysis of case law in the Republic of Lithuania (case study of recent tax disputes between the taxpayers and customs authorities that arose immediately before and after the entry into force of the UCC), leads to the conclusion that many problematic areas that may negatively impact the functioning of the new <b>Customs</b> <b>Code</b> remain and must be improved, including an adoption of new legislative solutions...|$|R
