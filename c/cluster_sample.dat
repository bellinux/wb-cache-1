5000|$|There {{is little}} doubt, however, that the {{community}} of cross-cultural researchers have been remiss in ignoring Galton's problem. Expert investigation of this question shows results that [...] "strongly suggest that the extensive reporting of naïve chi-square independence tests using cross-cultural data sets {{over the past several}} decades has led to incorrect rejection of null hypotheses at levels much higher than the expected 5% rate." [...] The investigator concludes that [...] "Incorrect theories that have been 'saved' by naïve chi-square tests with comparative data may yet be more rigorously tested another day."

Since this critique was published in 1993, and others like it, more authors have begun to adopt corrections for Galton's problem, but the majority in the cross-cultural field have not. Consequently, a large proportion of published results that rely on naive significance tests and that adopt the P < 0.05 rather than a P < 0.005 standard are likely to be in error because they are more susceptible to type I error, which is to reject the null hypothesis when it is true.|$|E

The first-stage sampling frame contained 2,919 primary sampling units (PSUs), consisting of 2- and 4-year colleges and universities. The second sampling stage consisted of a random sample drawn from the primary sample unit frame enrolled in the 136 participating colleges and universities to increase the sample size to 4,609 undergraduate college students aged greater than or equal to 18 years old with a representative sample demographic matching the national demographic. Differential sampling rates of the PSU were used to ensure sufficient numbers of male and female, black and Hispanic students in the total sample population. After differential sample weighting, female students represented 55.5% of the sample; white students represented 72.8% of the sample, black students 10.3%, Hispanic students 7.1%, and 9.9% were other. It was determined that nationwide, 13.1% of college students reported that they had been forced to have sexual intercourse against their will during their lifetime. Female students were significantly more likely than male students to report they had ever been forced to have sexual intercourse; 20% of approximately 2500 females (55% of 4,609 samples) and 3.9% of males reported experiencing rape thus far in the course of their lifetime.|$|E

The fate of the universe seems to be entirely determined by dark energy and a deeper understanding of itsproperties may shed light on the unification of general relativity and quantum theory. At the moment, astronomical measurements seem most likely to provide further information about dark energy. Measurements of the evolution of thegalaxy cluster abundance are among the most promising tools; they have the potential to yield tight constraints on the equation of state of dark energy.
