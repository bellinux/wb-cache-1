40|$|AbstractThe {{wastewater}} {{construction projects}} {{are needed for}} meeting the environment regulatory and compliance, preserving the sewer system and treatment infrastructure and reducing the sewer spills. However, most business owners {{do not understand the}} fundamental of the sewer service charge program and the current sewer service <b>charge</b> <b>adjustment</b> guideline only provides very basic information for the program. These business owners end up with significant amount of money and time wasted since they often fall short of qualification for sewer service <b>charge</b> <b>adjustment.</b> More importantly, no sewer service charge evaluation or cost benefit analysis is conducted for new construction projects. Therefore, the objective {{of this paper is to}} evaluate wastewater charge saving strategies through two case studies that include hospital buildings and large residential complex buildings having more than 100 units. Detailed cost comparative analysis is presented to show if the saving strategies are achievable for each case. Lastly, this paper recommends the best property management approach for the review of sewer service charge so that the significant amount of long term sewer service charge saving can be achieved for larger commercial project...|$|E
40|$|The {{adsorption}} {{of natural}} organic matter (NOM) on mineral (hydr) oxide {{plays an important}} role in the evaluation of the speciation of toxic metal ions in the environment. Because both NOM and mineral oxide have variable charges that adjust upon adsorption, a good understanding of proton binding is required before the binding of metal ions can be understood. In this study, the adsorption of purified Aldrich humic acid (PAHA) on goethite was examined as a function of the environmental conditions (pH, salt concentration, and free concentration of PAHA) together with the proton adsorption to PAHA, goethite, and their mixtures. The induced charges on both components were separated on the basis of the difference between the charge/pH curves of the mixture and those of the single components. The electrostatic potential profile across the adsorbed layer was obtained as a numerical solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation using the charge density of the adsorbed PAHA and the goethite surface. From the quantitative evaluation of the induced charge on both components, it is revealed that the degree of the <b>charge</b> <b>adjustment</b> is related to the electrostatic affinity between the PAHA segments and the goethite surface, the electrostatic repulsion between the PAHA segments, and the electrostatic shielding by salt ions. Considering the charge distribution of the adsorbed PAHA at the goethite surface, it is concluded that the change of the <b>charge</b> <b>adjustment</b> is sensitive to that of the conformation of the adsorbed PAHA. From the detailed inspection of the assumptions made and the comparison with the reported theoretical calculations, the obtained potential profiles are considered to broadly reflect the true potential profiles. Because a <b>charge</b> <b>adjustment</b> is not frequently considered in detail in relation to the NOM adsorption on metal (hydr) oxides, the obtained results can form the basis for the further development of modeling of the adsorption of NOM on (hydr) oxide surfaces...|$|E

It does not evolve with time in each series of measurements, since bulk Si is not affected by the doping process. A variation of the diameters of the other semicircles is measured in time, at a variable extent, especially in data at highest current. The appearance/disappearance of the responses is connected with the time constants related to the different processes. From the fitting described earlier, values {{in the order of}} microseconds are obtained for the first RC element, so confirming a rapid process of <b>charge</b> <b>adjustment</b> in the bulk solid phase. Slower processes, represented by the other semicircles, are observed at lower current doping (time constants of order of 10 - 1  s), while an acceleration of them is observed at higher current (time constants in the order of ms). The presence of the DT can tentatively be associated to the large and rapid variation observed in the third semicircle in the higher current time evolution, not visible in the lower current measurements.|$|E

The tax advertisement is one of local originated revenues sources, especially in tax sector that has a quite good potentials and functions in local development, especially in Boyolali local government. The aim of the research is to know the advertisement tax collection system in DPPKAD of Boyolali, to identify the obstacles found in collection the tax, and to know the effort undertaken in increasing the tax collection. The type of the data employed is collected indirectly in the field. The data collection technique is done using interview, observation, and literary study. Based on the analysis, the research concludes that: 1) the advertisement tax collection system done by DPPKAD is in accordance to the collection system and follows the local government regulation (Perda) No. 12 of 2007 on Advertisement Tax, hence there are slight differences between the actualization and the regulation. It is done to optimize the local government revenues from advertisement tax; 2) the obstacles found in advertisement tax collection convey the unavailability of sufficient human resources and facilities; and 3) the effort undertaken by Boyolali local government to increase the tax collection convey service quality improvement, illumination and socialization to the advertisement bureaus and tax payers.

30|$|The {{reservoirs}} in the TZ 1 –TZ 4 well {{block of}} the Tarim Basin are complex, and the hydrocarbon enrichment shows differences. The three Carboniferous oil layers {{are characterized by}} “oil in {{the upper and lower}} layers and gas in the middle” in profile and “oil in the west and gas in the east” in plane view. In order to discuss the complex reservoir accumulation mechanisms, based on the petroleum geology and reservoir distribution, we studied the generation history of source rocks, the fault evolution and sealing, the accumulation periods and gas washing, and reconstructed the accumulation process of the TZ 1 –TZ 4 well block. It is concluded that the hydrocarbon enrichment differences of oil layers CIII, CII and CI were caused by multiple sources and multi-period hydrocarbon <b>charging</b> and <b>adjustment.</b> The CII was closely related to CIII, but CI was formed by reservoir adjustment during the Yanshan period and was not affected by gas washing after it was formed. During the Himalayan period, different degrees of gas washing in the east and west led to hydrocarbon enrichment differences on the plane. The Carboniferous accumulation process of two-stage <b>charging</b> and one-stage <b>adjustment</b> is summarized: oil charging during the late Hercynian period is the first accumulation period of CIII and CII; oil reservoirs were adjusted into CI in the Yanshan period; finally gas washing in the Himalayan period is the second accumulation period of CIII and CII, but CI was not affected by gas washing. This complex accumulation process leads to the hydrocarbon enrichment differences in the TZ 1 –TZ 4 well block.|$|R

40|$|Using {{economic}} principles, {{the author}} provides criteria for financing infrastructure services where consumption-related user charges can be levied effectively. In {{light of the}} suggested criteria, the author examines the experience of developing countries in financing publicly provided infrastructure services in transport (road), water, telecommunications, and power. In developing countries, most infrastructure {{is provided by the}} public sector, although the private sector has become increasingly involved. Because it is difficult to raise funds through general taxes, self financing of these services remains a desirable second-best policy, one that almost all developing countries endorse. But experience suggests that, except in telecommunications, full cost recovery is more the exception than the rule. Financing remains inadequate. The political economy of tariff setting is an important element in low improperly designed user <b>charges,</b> infrequent <b>adjustments</b> for inflation, and poor enforcement. Such sectors as water, power, and transportation drains funds from the treasury, although their impact varies from sector to sector. When it is difficult to get budget transfers to materialize - especially during a fiscal crisis - there is often a reduction in nonwage operations and maintenance expenditures. As a result, services deteriorate. The private provision of infrastructure services is often suggested as an alternative. The private provision of services can certainly reduce the public sector's financing requirement. For infrastructure services for which technological advances have made competition possible, the market system could ensure efficient private provision of services, which could be a relief to the public sector. But for services that require a single provider to achieve economies of scale and similar benefits, the private provision of services will work only if an appropriate rate of return is assured - and only if user charges cover costs.

40|$|The {{relation}} between batteries' {{state of charge}} (SOC) and open-circuit voltage (OCV) is a specific feature of electrochemical energy storage devices. Especially NiMH batteries are well known to exhibit OCV hysteresis, and also several kinds of lithium-ion batteries show OCV hysteresis, which can be critical for reliable state estimation issues. Electrode potential hysteresis is known to result from thermodynamical entropic effects, mechanical stress, and microscopic distortions within the active electrode materials which perform a two-phase transition during lithium insertion/extraction. Hence, some Li-ion cells including two-phase transition active materials show pronounced hysteresis referring to their open-circuit voltage. This work points out how macroscopic effects, that is, diffusion limitations, superimpose the latte- mentioned microscopic mechanisms and lead to a shrinkage of OCV hysteresis, if cells are loaded with high current rates. To validate the mentioned interaction, Li-ion cells' state of charge is adjusted to 50 % with various current rates, beginning from the fully charged and the discharged state, respectively. As a pronounced difference remains between the OCV after <b>charge</b> and discharge <b>adjustment,</b> obviously the hysteresis vanishes as the target SOC is adjusted with very high current rate...|$|R

Better {{understanding}} {{the impact of}} changes in physical activity behavior on short-term health care charges may inform resource allocation decisions to increase population levels of physical activity. This study examines the prospective relationship of changes in physical activity status on short-term changes in health care charges for older adults. Methods. A prospective cohort study was done on a stratified random sample of 2, 393 adults aged 50 and older enrolled in a Minnesota health plan, predicting changes in resource use between two periods (September 1994 to August 1995 and September 1996 to August 1997) based on billed health care <b>charges.</b> Results.

40|$|AbstractIn Thailand, 67 % (119, 434 GWh) {{of primary}} energy {{resource}} for electricity generation relies on natural gas. Therefore, {{it may not}} be sustainable for the future, due to instability of energy resources. Thai government has launched the policy measure to motivate private sector for investment in electricity generation from renewable energy since 2007. It was called “Adder”. In 2012, the feed-in tariffs (FIT) measure has been announced by the National Energy Board in 2013 to replace adder because adder is paid on top of the retail electricity price but FIT is a fixed price. However, both adder and FIT subsidize so higher cost resulting in higher retail electricity price to customers. This study assesses impact on retail electricity price thru fuel <b>adjustment</b> <b>charge</b> (Ft) from Adder and FIT policy during 2010 to 2030 by using the alternative energy development plan (AEDP), optimization, and power development plan (PDP 2010 rev. 3).

The FIT will increase average national electricity production cost in Ft mechanism by 0. 013 Baht/kWh in 2030 while Adders will increase average national electricity production cost of 0. 154 Baht/kWh in 2030. It is found that FIT scheme lowers burden of subsidy than adder scheme in both short and long terms.

50|$|Ion-exchange {{chromatography}} separates molecules {{based on}} their respective charged groups. Ion-exchange chromatography retains analyte molecules on the column based on coulombic (ionic) interactions. Essentially, molecules undergo electrostatic interactions with opposite charges on the stationary phase matrix. The stationary phase consists of an immobile matrix that contains charged ionizable functional groups or ligands. The stationary phase surface displays ionic functional groups (R-X) that interact with analyte ions of opposite charge. To achieve electroneutrality, these inert charges couple with exchangeable counterions in the solution. Ionizable molecules {{that are to be}} purified compete with these exchangeable counterions for binding to the immobilized charges on the stationary phase. These ionizable molecules are retained or eluted {{based on their}} charge. Initially, molecules that do not bind or bind weakly to the stationary phase are first to wash away. Altered conditions are needed for the elution of the molecules that bind to the stationary phase. The concentration of the exchangeable counterions, which competes with the molecules for binding, can be increased or the pH can be changed. A change in pH affects the charge on the particular molecules and, therefore, alters binding. The molecules then start eluting out based on the changes in their <b>charges</b> from the <b>adjustments.</b> Further such adjustments can be used to release the protein of interest. Additionally, concentration of counterions can be gradually varied to separate ionized molecules. This type of elution is called gradient elution. On the other hand, step elution can be used in which the concentration of counterions are varied in one step. This type of chromatography is further subdivided into cation exchange chromatography and anion-exchange chromatography. Positively charged molecules bind to anion exchange resins while negatively charged molecules bind to cation exchange resins. The ionic compound consisting of the cationic species M+ and the anionic species B- can be retained by the stationary phase.|$|R
40|$|The {{transition}} for any executive {{into a new}} appointment is a challenge. This transition for {{the newly}} appointed Chief Information Officer (CIO) is especially challenging given the complexity and ambiguous nature of their role. Investment in information technology (IT) has steadily increased {{over the past twenty}} years and contributes to enabling business changes that drive organizational performance improvements. The role of the Chief Information Officer (CIO) has evolved into an executive who holds significant responsibility for leading the organization in realizing these investment benefits. Therefore unsuccessful CIO transitions can negatively impact {{the extent to which the}} organization’s IT benefits are fully realized. This research has one objective: to increase our understanding of the process of taking charge for the newly appointed Chief Information Officer (CIO). This increased understanding contributes to academic research as well as provides insights to practicing CIOs that will increase their probability of successfully taking charge of a new appointment. The project explores this phenomenon in depth from both the CIO’s and non-IT executive’s (CxO) perspective through semi-structured interviews with 43 executives. Participants included twenty-one Chief Information Officers and twenty-two C-suite, non-IT executives. The study integrates concepts from role theory and leader socialization with CIO leadership challenges. Findings indicate that the newly appointed CIO experiences a mutual adjustment process when they take <b>charge.</b> This <b>adjustment</b> occurs within their role set; the IT leadership team, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the other top management team members (CxOs). The data suggests that CIOs experience three overlapping phases of taking charge; Entry, Stabilization and Renewal. These phases result in confidence, credibility and legitimacy as a new leader in the organization. The data further reveals that the type of transition (Start-up, Turnaround, Realignment or Success-sustaining) encountered by the CIO is a significant influence on the taking charge process. CIO socialization is influenced heavily by their role set and the expectations within it. CIOs will encounter CxO peers with varying preferences on interaction style and focus. In addition the CxOs in the study identified three different views of CIOs that reinforce the role ambiguity for the newly appointed CIO. The study reveals that CIOs experience organizational socialization in two domains of leadership. These domains are supply-side and demand-side leadership. The data suggests that supply-side socialization occurs prior to demand-side socialization. These socialization outcomes are dependent on transition type. This research extends previous work done on CIO transitions by identifying phases, activities and outcomes. An additional contribution is the first empirical model of new CIO socialization. Leader socialization research is enhanced with the study of a non-CEO executive. This model contributes a deeper understanding of the mutual adjustment process experienced by a newly appointed CIO. Practicing CIOs can apply these findings in developing transition plans and actions for taking a new appointment. The CxO types and attitudes can inform the newly appointed CIO on customizing their relationship building approaches. Understanding that taking charge requires 2 - 3 years can lead to more realistic expectations of the executive. The findings of this study can lead CIOs to a higher probability of success in taking charge of a new appointment...|$|R
