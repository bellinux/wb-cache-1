Moreover, It has been assumed that each recording model regardless of differences In its construction must comprehensively reflect the assets of a given economic subject, changes occurring in It, as well as costs and revenues of its activity.

40|$|A variational {{formulation}} and {{solution of}} general three-dimensional potential flows {{gave rise to}} the construction of a special family of ‘trial functions’. This family is composed by circular-sector vortex rings, here named &# 945;-rings, i. e., rings that are positioned on the border of a circular sector with aperture angle &# 945;. An explicit formula for the velocity potential describing the &# 945;-rings family is here derived. A particular case is the well-known <b>circular</b> vortex-ring.

The pressure was measured by using a catheter, and the diameter firstly, at the same site, by a plethysmograph with mercury gauge and secondly, by a sonomicrometer with ferroelectric ceramic transducers. The unstressed radius and thickness were measured {{at the end of}} each experiment in situ. Considering that the viscous component is not important relatively to the nonlinear component of the elasticity and utilizing several equations for Young modulus calculation (thick and thin wall <b>circular</b> cylindrical tube <b>formulas</b> and Bergel's equation) the following values were obtained for this parameter: 0. 6 MPa- 2 MPa in midabdominal aorta and 2 MPa- 6. 5 MPa in thoracic ascending aorta.

5000|$|Some {{properties}} of Kottler-Møller or Rindler coordinates were anticipated by Albert Einstein (1907) when he discussed the uniformly accelerated reference frame. While introducing {{the concept of}} Born rigidity, Max Born (1909) recognized that the formulas for the worldline of hyperbolic motion can be reinterpreted as transformations into a [...] "hyperbolically accelerated reference system". Born himself, as well as Arnold Sommerfeld (1910) and Max von Laue (1911) used this frame to compute the {{properties of}} charged particles and their fields (see Acceleration (special relativity)#History and Rindler coordinates#History). In addition, Gustav Herglotz (1909) gave a classification of all Born rigid motions, including uniform rotation and the worldlines of constant curvatures. Friedrich Kottler (1912, 1914) introduced the [...] "generalized Lorentz transformation" [...] for proper reference frames or proper coordinates (Eigensystem, Eigenkoordinaten) by using comoving Frenet-Serret tetrads, and applied this formalism to Herglotz' worldlines of constant curvatures, particularly to hyperbolic motion and uniform <b>circular</b> motion. Herglotz' <b>formulas</b> were also simplified and extended by Georges Lemaître (1924). The worldlines of constant curvatures were rediscovered by several author, for instance, by Vladimír Petrův (1964), as [...] "timelike helices" [...] by John Lighton Synge (1967) or as [...] "stationary worldlines" [...] by Letaw (1981). The concept of proper reference frame was later reintroduced and further developed in connection with Fermi-Walker transport in the textbooks by Christian Møller (1952) or Synge (1960). An overview of proper time transformations and alternatives was given by Romain (1963), who cited the contributions of Kottler. In particular, Misner & Thorne & Wheeler (1973) combined Fermi-Walker transport with rotation, which influenced many subsequent authors. Bahram Mashhoon (1990, 2003) analyzed the hypothesis of locality and accelerated motion. The relations between the spacetime Frenet-Serret formulas and Fermi-Walker transport was discussed by Iyer & C. V. Vishveshwara (1993), Johns (2005) or Bini et al. (2008) and others.
