5|$|During {{production}} of the first series, Macfadyen, along with co stars Keeley Hawes and David Oyelowo were wary of playing the lead characters in their mid-twenties, but since felt they {{earned the right to}} be in the series. During {{production of}} episodes three and five of the first series, Macfadyen burst a blood vessel on one of his eyes. Macfadyen compensated by wearing sunglasses in order to hide it. Halfway through filming series two, Macfadyen got to <b>carry</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> {{for the first time in}} the series; he was disappointed in not carrying one in the first series.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, Castro {{joined the}} Party of the Cuban People (Partido Ortodoxo), founded by veteran {{politician}} Eduardo Chibás. A charismatic figure, Chibás advocated social justice, honest government and political freedom, while his party exposed corruption and demanded reform. Though Chibás came {{third in the}} 1948 general election, Castro remained committed to working on his behalf. Student violence escalated after Grau employed gang leaders as police officers and Castro soon received a death threat urging {{him to leave the}} university, but refusing and beginning to <b>carry</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> and surrounding himself with armed friends. In later years, anti-Castro dissidents accused him of committing gang-related assassinations at the time, but these remain unproven.|$|E

25|$|During {{his time}} in China, Gordon was well known and {{respected}} by friend and foe alike for leading from the front and going into combat armed only with his rattan cane (Gordon always refused to <b>carry</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> or a sword), a choice of a weapon that almost cost Gordon his life several times. Gordon's bravery in battle, his string of victories, apparent immunity to bullets and his intense, blazing blue eyes led many Chinese to believe that Gordon had supernatural powers and had harnessed the Qi (the mystical life-force traditionally believed in China to govern everything) in some extraordinary way.|$|E
25|$|Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur {{investigated}} {{the case in}} conjunction with police. Hecht's first clue was a police photograph of the two weapons used in the shooting. Both were virtually identical Colt M1911's. Hecht thought it odd {{that a man who}} appeared to be a penniless vagrant—he had less than $5 on his person when found—would carry such an expensive weapon which was not widely available to the public at the time, instead of selling it. He also found {{it hard to believe that}} a mere drifter would risk a conflict with a veteran who was widely known to <b>carry</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun.</b> MacArthur came to a similar conclusion and came to find that the stranger's weapon had been sold to Wanderer's cousin Fred several years earlier.|$|E
500|$|After {{the first}} five songs, The Revival {{features}} songs at a calmer tempo and more conventional style, with ballads that are more relaxed and low-key. [...] "It Never Rains (In Southern California)" [...] was titled after an oft-repeated phrase from one of Tony! Toni! Toné!'s attorneys, who used it {{in response to the}} group wearing heavy coats after returning from visits on the East Coast. Group drummer Timothy Christian played most of the song's instruments, and bassist Raphael Wiggins wrote its lyrics about a man longing for a woman who was in southern California. The ballads are followed by [...] "Those Were the Days", which features jouncing banjo, trumpet, and wistful lyrics reminiscing about simpler times [...] "when a dollar was worth a dollar, and you didn't have to <b>carry</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> when you left your house." ...|$|E

5000|$|On June 27, 2010, DeRoche {{was arrested}} for {{allegedly}} being intoxicated and <b>carrying</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun.</b> [...] The charge was dismissed by the Michigan Court of Appeals since DeRoche was not actually <b>carrying</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> {{at the time in}} question. The ruling stated DeRoche [...] "was not engaging in an unlawful behavior nor were there any facts to suggest that (DeRoche) possessed the handgun for any unlawful purposes." ...|$|R
2500|$|According to Scott Speedman, {{the actor}} who portrays Michael in the franchise, about how his [...] "personal lack of gun {{knowledge}} worked in his favor"; [...] "I get to <b>carry</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> once in the movie and I didn't know what I was doing, and that was appropriate. I'm the [...] "girlfriend". Every time I've got this shocked look {{on my face and}} she throws me to the ground. I'm screaming in terror. When I was watching it I was like, [...] "Wow, how weird." [...] I'm fine with it. I'm glad I didn't have to know what I was doing with guns. That was easy for me".|$|E
2500|$|Holliday's {{last known}} {{confrontation}} {{took place in}} Hyman's saloon in Leadville. Down to his last dollar, he had pawned his jewelry, and then borrowed $5 from Billy Allen, a bartender and special officer at the Monarch Saloon, which enabled Allen to <b>carry</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> and make arrests within the saloon. When Allen demanded he be repaid, Holliday could not comply. He knew Allen was armed, and when Allen appeared ready to attack him, he shot him, wounding him in the arm. Holliday was arrested and put on trial. He claimed self-defense, noting that Allen outweighed him by 50 pounds and he feared for his life. [...] A witness testified that Allen had been armed and in Hyman's {{earlier in the day}} apparently looking for Holliday. On March 28, 1885, the jury acquitted Holliday.|$|E
2500|$|Martha {{is first}} seen in action with UNIT in [...] "The Sontaran Stratagem", where Donna Noble, the Doctor's current companion, reacts with shock asking derisively if the Doctor turns {{all of his}} companions into [...] "soldiers". The Doctor also appears to {{disapprove}} over the situation until Martha defends her intentions, reminding the Doctor that she herself does not <b>carry</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun,</b> and stating that {{she is trying to}} make UNIT [...] "better" [...] from the inside. Agyeman herself states that she was never in any worry about Martha becoming too gun-toting: [...] "I never felt any danger of that happening. At the end of Series Three, she'd struggled for a year, and travelled alone, and saw all this hardship, her family tortured... that's going to have affected her. At the same time, she's continued in her studies to become a doctor, so obviously she still has this caring side to her".|$|E

2500|$|The {{events that}} {{occurred}} immediately following the shooting were streamed live in a 10-minute video by Reynolds via Facebook. The recording appears to begin seconds after Castile was shot, just after 9:00p.m. CDT. The video depicts Castile slumped over, moaning and moving slightly, with a bloodied left arm and side. In the video, Reynolds is speaking with Yanez and explaining what happened. Reynolds stated on the video that Yanez [...] "asked him for license and registration. He {{told him that it}} was in his wallet, but he had a pistol on him because he's licensed to carry." [...] Castile did have a license to <b>carry</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun.</b> Reynolds further narrated that the officer said, [...] "Don't move" [...] and as Castile was putting his hands back up, the officer shot him in the arm four or five times. Reynolds told the officer, [...] "You shot four bullets into him, sir. He was just getting his license and registration, sir." [...] Reynolds also said [...] "Please don't tell me he's dead," [...] while Yanez exclaims: [...] "I told him not to reach for it! I told him to get his hand open!" ...|$|E
60|$|To this Percy {{strongly}} objected. He {{was going}} out on a sort of a bear-hunt, and to him half the pleasure would be lost if he did not <b>carry</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun.</b> I am not a coward, but a boy with a gun is a terror to me. My expression may have intimated my state of mind, for Mr. Larramie said to me that we had now gone so far {{that it would be a}} pity to send Percy back, and that he did not think there would be any danger, for his boy had been taught how to <b>carry</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> properly.|$|E
