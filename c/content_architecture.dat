Information and content retrieval is a critical service for mobile ad-hoc networks. It relies on many resources and tools, such as internal storage, content searching and sharing, delay-tolerant delivery, etc. Previous studies have shown that conventional ICN interest query schemes and <b>content</b> searching <b>architectures,</b> if not properly designed, can cause significant performance degradation and energy consumption, especially for large scale mobile ad hoc networks.

Future components fabricated out of these woven ceramic matrix composites are expected to vary in shape, curvature, architecture, and thickness. The design of future components using woven ceramic matrix composites necessitates a modeling approach that can account for these variations which are physically controlled by local constituent <b>contents</b> and <b>architecture.</b> Research over the years supported primarily by NASA Glenn Research Center has {{led to the development of}} simple mechanistic-based models that can describe the entire stress-strain curve for composite systems fabricated with chemical vapor infiltrated matrices and melt-infiltrated matrices for a wide range of constituent <b>content</b> and <b>architecture.</b> Several examples will be presented that demonstrate the approach to modeling which incorporates a thorough understanding of the stress-dependent matrix cracking properties of the composite system...|$|R

50|$|Experimentally, {{the phase}} {{separation}} can {{be followed by}} turbidimetry. There is no universal approach for determining the cloud point suitable for all systems. It is often defined as the temperature {{at the onset of}} cloudiness, the temperature at the inflection point of the transmittance curve, or the temperature at a defined transmittance (e.g., 50%). The cloud point can be affected by many structural parameters of the polymer like the hydrophobic <b>content,</b> <b>architecture</b> and even the molar mass.|$|E
40|$|Web proxies and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) {{are widely}} used to {{accelerate}} Web content delivery and to conserve Internet bandwidth. These caching agents are highly effective for static content, which {{is an important component}} of all Web-based services. This paper explores the effect of ubiquitous Web caching on the request patterns seen by other components of an end-to-end <b>content</b> delivery <b>architecture,</b> including Web server clusters and interior caches. In particular, object popularity distributions in the Web tend to be Zipf-like, but caches disproportionately absorb requests for the most popular objects, changing the reference properties of the filtered request stream in fundamental ways. We call this the trickle-down effect. This paper uses trace-driven simulation and synthetic traffic patterns to illustrate the trickle-down effect and to investigate its impact on other components of a <b>content</b> delivery <b>architecture,</b> focusing on the implications for request distribution strategies in server clusters...|$|R

We look at how a target group of intermittently and partially connected mobile nodes can improve the diffusion of information within the group by leveraging fixed and mobile nodes that are exterior to the group. The fixed nodes are data sources, and the external mobile nodes are data relays, and we examine the trade off {{between the use of}} each in order to obtain high satisfaction within the target group, which consists of data sinks. We conducted an experiment in Cambridge, UK, to gather mobility traces that we used for the study of this <b>content</b> distribution <b>architecture.</b> In this scenario, the simple fact that members of the target group collaborate leads to a delivery ratio of 90 %. In addition, the use of external mobile nodes to relay the information slightly increases the delivery ratio while significantly decreasing the delay...|$|R
