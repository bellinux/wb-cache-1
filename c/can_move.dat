5|$|The bishop <b>can</b> <b>move</b> {{any number}} of squares diagonally, but cannot leap over other pieces.|$|E
5|$|A five-per-side game is {{also common}} in indoor netball. Players <b>can</b> <b>move</b> {{throughout}} the court, {{with the exception}} of the shooting circles, which are restricted to certain attacking or defending players.|$|E
5|$|Being cold-blooded, frogs have {{to adopt}} {{suitable}} behaviour patterns to regulate their temperature. To warm up, they <b>can</b> <b>move</b> {{into the sun}} or onto a warm surface; if they overheat, they <b>can</b> <b>move</b> into the shade or adopt a stance that exposes the minimum area of skin to the air. This posture {{is also used to}} prevent water loss and involves the frog squatting close to the substrate with its hands and feet tucked under its chin and body. The colour of a frog's skin is used for thermoregulation. In cool damp conditions, the colour will be darker than on a hot dry day. The grey foam-nest tree frog (Chiromantis xerampelina) is even able to turn white to minimize the chance of overheating.|$|E
25|$|Limited range: It <b>can</b> <b>moves</b> {{one or two}} squares orthogonally {{forward or}} sideways.|$|R
5000|$|Hounds <b>can</b> only <b>move</b> {{straight}} forward, diagonally forward, or sideways. They cannot move backwards in any way. They <b>can</b> only <b>move</b> one space per {{turn onto}} a vacant point, {{and follow the}} pattern on the board. Only one hound <b>can</b> be <b>moved</b> per turn. There are no captures in this game by either the hounds or the hare.|$|R
25|$|The {{shifting}} of chords is especially simple {{for the regular}} tunings that repeat their open strings, in which case chords <b>can</b> be <b>moved</b> vertically: Chords <b>can</b> be <b>moved</b> three strings up (or down) in major-thirds tuning, and chords <b>can</b> be <b>moved</b> two strings up (or down) in augmented-fourths tuning. Regular tunings thus appeal to new guitarists and also to jazz-guitarists, whose improvisation is simplified by regular intervals.|$|R
5|$|Each chess piece {{has its own}} way of moving. In the diagrams, {{the dots}} mark the squares where the piece <b>can</b> <b>move</b> {{if there are no}} {{intervening}} piece(s) of either color.|$|E
5|$|Hydras {{and some}} sea anemones <b>can</b> <b>move</b> slowly over rocks and sea or stream beds by various means: {{creeping}} like snails, crawling like inchworms, or by somersaulting. A few can swim clumsily by waggling their bases.|$|E
5|$|Many {{bacteria}} <b>can</b> <b>move</b> using {{a variety}} of mechanisms: flagella are used for swimming through fluids; bacterial gliding and twitching motility move bacteria across surfaces; and changes of buoyancy allow vertical motion.|$|E
50|$|Moving a {{distance}} of one square takes one action; moving two squares takes two actions Since a player has only two actions per turn, the maximum distance a piece <b>can</b> be <b>moved</b> on one turn is two squares. Pieces <b>can</b> be <b>moved</b> forward, backward, left, or right, but not diagonally. However, a player <b>can</b> effectively <b>move</b> a piece diagonally by using two actions—forward and right, for example.|$|R
50|$|The {{shifting}} of chords is especially simple {{for the regular}} tunings that repeat their open strings, in which case chords <b>can</b> be <b>moved</b> vertically: Chords <b>can</b> be <b>moved</b> three strings up (or down) in major-thirds tuning, and chords <b>can</b> be <b>moved</b> two strings up (or down) in augmented-fourths tuning. Regular tunings thus appeal to new guitarists and also to jazz-guitarists, whose improvisation is simplified by regular intervals.|$|R
5000|$|Technically, one {{may only}} move the cards between columns {{one at a}} time; however, the {{presence}} of a free cell essentially increases the number of cards that <b>can</b> be <b>moved.</b> (e.g., if there are three open cells, four cards <b>can</b> be <b>moved</b> at once—one for each cell, and the one that <b>can</b> always be <b>moved.)</b> ...|$|R
5|$|The queen {{combines}} {{the power of}} a rook and bishop and <b>can</b> <b>move</b> any number of squares along a rank, file, or diagonal, but cannot leap over other pieces.|$|E
5|$|The rook <b>can</b> <b>move</b> {{any number}} of squares along a rank or file, but cannot leap over other pieces. Along with the king, a rook is {{involved}} during the king's castling move.|$|E
5|$|Python's {{developers}} {{strive to}} avoid premature optimization, and moreover, reject patches to non-critical parts of CPython that would offer a marginal {{increase in speed}} {{at the cost of}} clarity. When speed is important, a Python programmer <b>can</b> <b>move</b> time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or try using PyPy, a just-in-time compiler. Cython is also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.|$|E
50|$|Cards in the Tableau or the Reserve <b>can</b> be <b>moved</b> to a Foundation or {{onto another}} Tableau Stack. Only the topmost card of any stack <b>can</b> be <b>moved.</b> The Tableau builds {{up or down}} in suit.|$|R
5000|$|Since cards only <b>can</b> be <b>moved</b> once (because 7♣ only <b>can</b> be <b>moved</b> to 8♣), {{the cards}} under moved cards will be blocked until the redeal {{or until the}} cards above are moved to the foundations.|$|R
50|$|One card <b>can</b> be <b>moved</b> at a time, but {{sequences}} {{that are}} already built <b>can</b> be <b>moved,</b> in part or in whole, as unit. But when a gap occurs, it can be filled only with a single card.|$|R
5|$|Sponges {{constitute}} the phylum Porifera, {{and have been}} defined as sessile metazoans (multicelled immobile animals) that have water intake and outlet openings connected by chambers lined with choanocytes, cells with whip-like flagella. However, a few carnivorous sponges have lost these water flow systems and the choanocytes. All known living sponges can remold their bodies, as most types of their cells <b>can</b> <b>move</b> within their bodies and a few can change from one type to another.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of autonomous robots capable of constructing intricate structures without human assistance has {{been inspired by}} the complex mounds that termites build. These robots work independently and <b>can</b> <b>move</b> by themselves on a tracked grid, capable of climbing and lifting up bricks. Such robots may be useful for future projects on Mars, or for building levees to prevent flooding.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Jumping Flash! 2 {{is virtually}} identical to its predecessor; {{the game is}} presented in a first-person perspective, and the player <b>can</b> <b>move</b> freely in three-dimensional world and rotate the camera in any direction. The user interface resembles much {{of the characteristics of}} its predecessor; the top part of the screen shows the time remaining, the player's score, and one of four of Robbit's AI sidekicks who offers the player warnings, reminders and hints.|$|E
50|$|Multi-strand chain {{conveyors}} {{are used}} for double pitch roller chains. Products that <b>can</b> not be <b>moved</b> on traditional roller conveyors <b>can</b> be <b>moved</b> by a multi-strand chain conveyor.|$|R
50|$|Welsh has {{a highly}} {{developed}} system of fronting constituents in focus in which {{parts of a}} sentence <b>can</b> be <b>moved</b> to the front for emphasis, rather than stressing them phonetically as English does. Most elements of a sentence <b>can</b> be <b>moved</b> to sentence-initial position.|$|R
50|$|On each turn two <b>moves</b> <b>can</b> be made, one {{for each}} die. The same or two {{different}} pieces <b>can</b> be <b>moved,</b> and the player can skip {{one or both of}} his moves.|$|R
5|$|The hubs of orb webs, {{where the}} spiders lurk, are usually above the center, as the spiders <b>can</b> <b>move</b> {{downwards}} faster than upwards. If {{there is an}} obvious direction in which the spider can retreat to avoid its own predators, the hub is usually offset towards that direction.|$|E
5|$|The {{player is}} usually {{accompanied}} {{by one or}} more friendly non-player characters, who will follow the player and provide assistance in combat against enemies. As they are often key to the story, friendly characters must not be killed in combat except during scripted events. In between combat missions, the player <b>can</b> <b>move</b> around the USS Voyager and interact with other members of its crew, often performing non-combat tasks to progress the story.|$|E
5|$|Their main tunnels {{are used}} for feeding and for escape: they can dig {{themselves}} underground very rapidly, and <b>can</b> <b>move</b> along existing tunnels at high speed both forwards and backwards. Their digging technique is to force the soil to either side with their powerful, shovel-like forelimbs, which are broad, flattened, toothed and heavily sclerotised (the cuticle is hardened and darkened).|$|E
50|$|You <b>can</b> only <b>move</b> your {{coloured}} portal.|$|R
25|$|There {{are three}} {{approaches}} {{to reduce the}} effect of bird strikes. The vehicles can be designed to be more bird resistant, the birds <b>can</b> be <b>moved</b> {{out of the way}} of the vehicle, or the vehicle <b>can</b> be <b>moved</b> {{out of the way of}} the birds.|$|R
50|$|The act of {{breaking}} a pin is unpinning. This can be executed {{in a number}} of ways: the piece creating the pin can be captured; another unit <b>can</b> be <b>moved</b> onto the line of the pin; or the unit to which a piece is pinned <b>can</b> be <b>moved.</b>|$|R
5|$|A cold front's {{location}} {{is at the}} leading edge of the temperature drop-off, which in an isotherm analysis shows up as {{the leading edge of the}} isotherm gradient, and it normally lies within a sharp surface trough. Cold fronts <b>can</b> <b>move</b> up to twice as fast as warm fronts and produce sharper changes in weather, since cold air is denser than warm air and rapidly lifts the warm air as the cold air moves in. Cold fronts are typically accompanied by a narrow band of showers and thunderstorms. On a weather map, the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of triangles/spikes (pips) pointing in the direction of travel, {{at the leading edge}} of the cooler air mass.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, John Maynard Smith, a noted {{biologist}} with {{a strong}} background in aeronautics, {{has pointed out that}} bumblebees would not be expected to sustain flight, as they would need to generate too much power given their tiny wing area. However, in aerodynamics experiments with other insects, he found that viscosity at the scale of small insects meant even their small wings <b>can</b> <b>move</b> a very large volume of air relative to their size, and this reduces the power required to sustain flight by an order of magnitude.|$|E
5|$|Aerobatic {{competitions}} {{take place}} for both powered aircraft and gliders, {{with up to}} 30 events {{each year in the}} UK and Ireland. Starting at the Beginner level, pilots <b>can</b> <b>move</b> up to Standard (powered aircraft) or Sports (glider) levels, and then on to Intermediate, Advanced, and finally Unlimited classes. Each step up requires a wider repertoire of aerobatic figures and progressively more performance from the aircraft. National championships are awarded annually at Standard/Sports, Intermediate, Advanced (powered aircraft only), and Unlimited levels, and pilots who have reached Advanced and Unlimited levels are eligible for selection to represent the UK in international competition.|$|E
5000|$|In 1960, <b>Canning</b> <b>moved</b> to New York City to {{work for}} a {{publishing}} company. [...] At the request of the IRA, he and Vincent Conlon assumed the leadership of Clan na Gael in the hope of raising additional funds for the IRA, although this had little immediate effect.|$|R
5000|$|While a civil review {{petition}} <b>can</b> be <b>moved</b> {{in accordance}} with Order XLVII, Rule 1(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure,1908 a criminal review petition <b>can</b> be <b>moved</b> only on the ground of an error apparent {{on the face of}} the record. (Source: CPC, 1908 and CRPC, 1973) ...|$|R
5000|$|The Canning Process - In {{order to}} imprison Monster-Skas in Taming Boxes (Domboxes), all Tamers {{have to follow}} the same procedure. First of all, the monster must be subdued using {{the power of the}} voice. Only when this has been done <b>can</b> the <b>Move</b> be used. The Tamer, with their right hand, makes a special <b>canning</b> <b>move</b> that sucks the monster safety into the Taming Box (Dombox). The final closing of the jar is of vital importance, because if it is not carried out quickly and firmly, the entire {{operation}} can be undone.|$|R
