However, the NLMS algorithm is known to exhibit low convergence speed especially when the input data covariance matrix is ill-conditioned. In this paper, we consider a sub-optimal implementation of the affine projection (AP) algorithm based on a prewithening mechanism, which renders the convergence characteristics less sensitive to the coloring of the input signal spectrum than {{is the case for}} the NLMS algorithm. Comparisons with the AP algorithm are given to validate our approach.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the use of}} a new code called random {{diagonal}} (RD) code for spectral amplitude coding (SAC) optical code division multiple access (OCDMA) networks, using  fiber Bragg-grating (FBG). FBG consists of a fiber segment whose index of reflection varies periodically along its length. RD code is constructed using a code level and data level, one of the important properties of this code is that the cross correlation at the data level is always zero, which means that phase intensity induced phase (PIIN) is reduced. We find the performance of the RD code to be better than those of the modified frequency hopping (MFH) and Hadamard codes. It has been observed from simulation and theoretical results that considering the bit error rate (BER), the RD code performs significantly better than other codes. The ability of RD codes to support simultaneous transmissions at different bit rates is shown through simulated results of the BER and the eye patterns. 10 Gbps and 2. 5 Gbps data transmissions have been successfully demonstrated together with FBG decoding scheme for <b>canceling</b> the <b>code</b> level from SAC-signal...|$|R

30|$|The {{reason for}} having the HC is that an antenna can be pointed towards the {{satellite}} to maximise the direct signal strength. Even in this case, the SNR at the input of the receiver can be as low as − 40 dB, so the HC signal cannot be used for synchronisation directly. This implies {{that in order to}} estimate the direct signal delay and phase, and extract from them the required clock slippage and oscillator drift, a tracking algorithm based on matched filtering is required to maximise SNR. An additional problem is the structure of all GNSS signals. They are communication signals consisting of two ranging codes which are pseudorandom sequences, which generally (but not necessarily) modulate a navigation message. From these three sequences, only the primary ranging code is desired as the transmitted signal for imaging, while the other two act as interference. Hence, a method of tracking the parameters of the primary <b>code</b> and <b>cancelling</b> the interfering <b>codes</b> is required.|$|R

This version is an Asian mutant who can {{communicate}} with any type of technology, while Murderworld {{is referred to as}} [...] "Madland". In this version, Arcade is willing to use his abilities to lure superheroes to Madland for his own childish amusement, regardless of possible consequences of his actions. In the episode [...] "Game Over", he plans to crack the codes to nuclear missiles where he plans to cause World War III. He started by sending a Life Model Decoy of Nick Fury which is defeated by Captain America as Arcade speaks through the Life Model Decoy. S.H.I.E.L.D. traces Arcade's transmission to Madripoor as Spider-Man joins up with Captain America to head to Madripoor. Upon the approach to Madripoor, Arcade takes control of Captain America's plane in order to crash it. Spider-Man and Captain America bail out to fight off Arcade's drones. Upon meeting up with Wolverine after some ninja Life Model Decoys are defeated, Arcade then unleashes Life Model Decoys of Spider-Man, Captain America and Wolverine. After the three Life Model Decoys are defeated, Arcade unleashes three Life Model Decoys modeled after the Hulk. Captain America and Wolverine defeat the Life Model Decoys of Hulk while Spider-Man destroys an array of lasers. When escaping to the next level upon evading the Life Model Decoys of Red Hulk, Arcade unleashes a Sentinel and other robots. Spider-Man reprograms the Sentinel to take out the other robots. Afterwards, Arcade is angered that Spider-Man is in his game which he designed for Captain America and Wolverine. Arcade then unleashes a giant robot that resembles Arcade's head to attack until Spider-Man destroys the laser cannon on its head. Spider-Man, Captain America and Wolverine then confront Arcade as Wolverine threatens him to <b>cancel</b> the <b>codes.</b> Arcade is then arrested by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.|$|R
40|$|Conference PaperThe {{trend toward}} higher bit rates in {{lightwave}} communications has {{increased interest in}} dispersion-shifted fiber (DSF) to minimize dispersion penalties. In addition, wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) {{is being used to}} gain even greater capacity, and broad bandwidth erbium-doped fiber amplifiers are extending link distances between signal regeneration. Taken together, these techniques can result in severe performance degradation due to four-wave mixing (FWM). Several different ways of reducing the FWM degradation in WDM systems have been proposed, but all of the approaches increase system complexity and make it difficult to add channels to the system. We show that wavelength-coded multiplexing can provide multiple channels on a simple fiber link while significantly reducing four-wave mixing interference compared to a WDM system. The FWM spectrum is symmetric and use of an antisymmetric <b>code</b> <b>cancels</b> the interference. Wavelength-coded multiplexing is also known as spectral code-division multiplexing (SCDM). We have calculated the error probability in the SCDM system considering only shot noise, thermal noise and FWM crosstalk, all of which are assumed to have a Gaussian distribution. For comparison, we also derived an expression for the error probability in a WDM system...|$|R

Next, this starting subject was compared to the amendment of the Civil Code, relating to the Civil Association. After that, the information which were obtained by comparing both versions of the Civil Code, were used to analyse some situations, arising within one specific non-profit organization in the light of the law, accounting and taxes.

However, many church leaders ignorantly teach that these verses mean something that it doesn't say (the Torah was nailed to the cross) when this verseand the rest of the Bible does not say this. When we sin (violation of the Torah), we bring a curse upon ourselves.(Deut 28:15) When we obey God (keep the Torah), we bring blessing upon our lives.(Deut 28:1-14). So, what was nailed to the cross was the PENALTY for sin (which is VIOLATING the Torah) (I John 3:4). The curse was for BREAKING the Torah (Deut 28:15-67). The BLESSING was for KEEPING the Torah (Deut 28:1-14). He Christ <b>cancelled</b> the written <b>code</b> with its regulations, that was against us and stood against us (the curse of God and eternal separation from Him for sinning—violating the Torah—and not repenting of our sins) nailing it (the penalty for our sins—violating the Torah), to the cross. However, in traditional Christianity, we have been taught that the curse comes by keeping the Torah when the Bible says exactly the opposite. Jesus Himself said in Matthew 5:17-19 that those who BREAK the Torah/commandments of God and teaches others to do so (most of historical Christianity for the past 2,000 years) will be called LEAST in the Kingdom of God but those who KEEP the Torah / commandments of God, will be called GREAT in the Kingdom of God.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{contentious}} debates between RISC and CISC {{have died}} down, and a CISC ISA, the x 86 {{continues to be}} popular. Nowadays, processors with CISC-ISAs translate the CISC instructions into RISC style micro-operations (eg: uops of Intel and ROPS of AMD). The use of the uops (or ROPS) allows the use of RISC-style execution cores, and use of various micro-architectural techniques {{that can be easily}} implemented in RISC cores. This can easily allow CISC processors to approach RISC performance. However, CISC ISAs do have the additional burden of translating instructions to micro-operations. In a 1991 study between VAX and MIPS, Bhandarkar and Clark showed that after <b>canceling</b> out the <b>code</b> size advantage of CISC and the CPI advantage of RISC, the MIPS processor had an average 2. 7 x advantage over the studied CISC processor (VAX). A 1997 study on Alpha 21064 and the Intel Pentium Pro still showed 5 % to 200 % advantage for RISC for various SPEC CPU 95 programs. A decade later and after introduction of interesting techniques such as fusion of micro-operations in the x 86, we set off to compare a recent RISC and a recent CISC processor, the IBM POWER 5 + and the Intel Woodcrest. We find that the SPEC CPU 2006 programs are divided between those showing an advantage on POWER 5 + or Woodcrest, narrowing down the 2. 7 x advantage to nearly 1. 0. Our study points to the fact that if aggressive micro-architectural techniques for ILP and high performance can be carefully applied, a CISC ISA can be implemented to yield similar performance as RISC processors. Another interesting observation is that approximately 40 % of all work done on the Woodcrest is wasteful execution in the mispredicted path. ...|$|R
