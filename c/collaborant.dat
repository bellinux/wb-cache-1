The goal was to vary the devices for all students {{to find a way}} to express themselves, individually or working together, in a class which needed to regain motivation and self-esteem. Analyse de trois dispositifs d’apprentissage mis en place avec une classe de 1 ère STMG pour l’étude d’une oeuvre intégrale, Incendies (2003) dudramaturge contemporain Wajdi Mouawad. Le journal de lecture, les ateliers théâtre et la contribution des élèves au site internet créé pour l’occasion par deux enseignantes et regroupant les travaux de trois classes de 1 ère, ont servi l’étude globale de la pièce et les lectures analytiques. L’objectif était de varier les dispositifs pour que tous les élèves trouvent un moyen de s’exprimer, individuellement ou en <b>collaborant,</b> dans une classe devant retrouver motivation et estime de soi...|$|E
40|$|This diploma thesis named The Personality of Jan Rys as a {{journalist}} and {{his work in the}} Flag magazine describes the personality of Jan Rys in all aspects of his life and work. In the introductory part it is set into the historical context where the state of protectorate journalism is described focusing on illegal and <b>collaborant</b> and activistic journalists. Part of the chapter concentrates on subsequent retribution courts. Another chapter focuses on the historical context where the origin and formation of fascism in our country is described and concentrates also on antisemitism in a Protectorate. The main part is focused on the character of Jan Rys, while his work in Vlajka movement is described whose leader he was until 1942, when he was sent at first to Terezin and than to Dachau, where he stayed till the end of war as well as his literature and his journalistic work. In the journalistic work it deals mainly with journal the Vlajka in the period when Jan Rys was an editor in chief, attention is paid to Rys' articles and their focus. A separate chapter analyzes a court trial with Jan Rys and other representatives of Vlajka, the seventh chapter concludes with the judgement of the National Court, which sentenced him to death by hanging...|$|E
40|$|We wouldn't like {{to bring}} up discrimination, but {{the tone of the}} commentary, which does not contain any {{science-based}} criticism or any alternative suggestions, does make one think of an unduly disrespectful attitude both towards the Russian participants and the project on radiative neutron decay itself. Here we cite our response to the commentary of our Western <b>collaborants</b> to the article printed in JETP Letters 83 (1) p. 5. We remain firm in the positions published in this article. In our last experiment we measured the relative intensity of radiative neutron decay (B. R. =(3. 2 +- 1. 6) 10 - 3 with C. L. = 99. 7 % and lower energy limit of radiative gamma-quanta measured equal to 35 KeV) ...|$|R
50|$|The Stalingrad victory, certain curbing of {{the terror}} {{campaign}} (actually since December 1942, formally in February 1943) and amnesty promised to repenting <b>collaborants</b> were a significant factors in the 1943 growth of the Soviet partisan forces. Desertions {{from the ranks of}} the German-controlled Hilfspolizei and military formations strengthened, with sometimes whole units coming over to Soviet partisan side — Volga Tartars battalion (900 personnel, February 1943), Gil-Rodionov 1st Russian People's brigade of the SS (2500 personnel, August 1943). Summarily, about 7 thousand people of miscellaneous anti-Soviet formations joined the Soviet partisan force. About 1,9 thousand specialists and commanders were inserted in the Belarusian lands in 1943. However, the local people comprised the core of the personnel influx in the Soviet partisan force.|$|R
40|$|The CMS {{computing}} model provides {{reconstruction and}} access to recorded data of the CMS detector {{as well as to}} Monte Carlo (MC) generated data. Due to the in-creased complexity, these functionalities will be provided by a tier structure of globally located computing centers us-ing GRID technologies. In the CMS baseline, user access to data is provided by the CMS Remote Analysis Builder (CRAB) analysis tool which enables the user to execute analysis applications on locally resident data using GRID tools independent of the geographical location. Currently, mostly two different toolkits provide the needed function-alities, the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (LCG) and the Open Science Grid (OSG). Due to infrastructure and service differences between the two toolkits, analysis tools developed for one are frequently not immediately compati-ble with the other. In this paper, we will describe the devel-opment of additions to the CRAB tool to run user analysis on OSG sites. We will discuss the approach of using the GRID submission of the Condor batch system (Condor-G) to provide a sandbox functionality for the user’s analysis job. For LCG sites, this is provided amongst other things by the resource broker. We will discuss the differences of user analysis on LCG and OSG sites and present first expe-riences running CMS user jobs at OSG sites. THE CMS COMPUTING MODEL The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) [1] is one of the four experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [2]. From the beginning of data taking on, the CMS detector will record large amounts of events which have to be avail-able to all CMS <b>collaborants</b> for analysis. After the trigger process and the reconstruction (see Fig. 1), the event information is split in ∼ 50 primary datasets according to trigger criteria.

The cumulated size of the recorded event data includ-ing reconstructed information plus the needed Monte Carlo (MC) data samples for analysis is expected to be in th...|$|R
