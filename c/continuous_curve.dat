5|$|As {{the points}} of any smooth simple closed curve move in this way, the curve remains simple and smooth. It loses area at a {{constant}} rate, and its perimeter decreases {{as quickly as possible}} for any <b>continuous</b> <b>curve</b> evolution. If the curve is non-convex, its total absolute curvature decreases monotonically, until it becomes convex. Once convex, the isoperimetric ratio of the curve decreases as the curve converges to a circular shape, before collapsing to a single point of singularity. If two disjoint simple smooth closed curves evolve, they remain disjoint until one of them collapses to a point.|$|E

40|$|A {{classical}} {{result in}} Riemannian geometry {{states that the}} absolutely <b>continuous</b> <b>curves</b> into a (finite-dimensional) Riemannian manifold form an infinite-dimensional manifold. In the present paper this construction and related results are generalised to absolutely <b>continuous</b> <b>curves</b> with values in a strong Riemannian manifolds. As an application we consider extensions of the square root velocity transform (SRVT) framework for shape analysis. Computations in this framework frequently lead to curves which leave the shape space (of smooth curves), and are only contained in a completion. In the vector valued case, this extends the SRVT to a space of absolutely <b>continuous</b> <b>curves.</b> We investigate the situation for shape spaces of manifold valued (absolutely <b>continuous)</b> <b>curves.</b> Comment: 29 pages, preliminary version, comments welcom...|$|R

25|$|A piecewise/composite Bézier {{curve is}} a series of Bézier curves joined with at least C0 {{continuity}} (the last point of one curve coincides with the starting point of the next curve). Depending on the application, additional smoothness requirements (such as C1 or C2 continuity) may be added. C1 <b>continuous</b> <b>curves</b> have identical tangents at the breakpoint (where the two <b>curves</b> meet). C2 <b>continuous</b> <b>curves</b> have identical curvature at the breakpoint.|$|R

25|$|The {{first step}} in {{preprocessing}} is conventionally slice timing correction. The MR scanner acquires different slices within a single brain volume at different times, and hence the slices represent brain activity at different timepoints. Since this complicates later analysis, a timing correction is applied to bring all slices to the same timepoint reference. This is done by assuming the timecourse of a voxel is smooth when plotted as a dotted line. Hence the voxel's intensity value at other times not in the sampled frames can be calculated by filling in the dots to create a <b>continuous</b> <b>curve.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{population}} of Tikal began a <b>continuous</b> <b>curve</b> of growth {{starting in the}} Preclassic Period (approximately 2000 BC – AD 200), with a peak in the Late Classic with the population growing rapidly from AD 700 through to 830, followed by a sharp decline. For the [...] area falling within the earthwork defenses of the hinterland, the peak population is estimated at 517 per square kilometer (1340 per square mile). In an area within a [...] radius of the site core, peak population is estimated at 120,000; population density is estimated at 265 per square kilometer (689 per square mile). In a region within a [...] radius of the site core and including some satellite sites, peak population is estimated at 425,000 with a density of 216 per square kilometer (515 per square mile). These population figures are even more impressive because of the extensive swamplands that were unsuitable for habitation or agriculture. However, some archaeologists, such as David Webster, believe these figures to be far too high.|$|E

40|$|The {{square root}} {{velocity}} function (SRVF), introduced by Srivastava et al, {{has proved to}} be an effective way to compare absolutely <b>continuous</b> <b>curves</b> in $R^N$ modulo reparametrization. Several computational papers have been published based on this method. In this paper, we carefully establish the theoretical foundations of the SRVF method. In particular, we analyze the quotient construction of the set of absolutely <b>continuous</b> <b>curves</b> modulo the group (or in some cases, semigroup) of reparametrizations, proving an important theorem about the structure of the closed orbits required in this quotient construction. We observe that the set of piecewise linear curves is dense in the space of absolutely <b>continuous</b> <b>curves</b> with respect to the SRVF metric. Finally, given two piecewise linear curves, we establish a precise algorithm for producing the optimal matching between these curves. This also results in a precise determination of the geodesic between the points in the quotient space corresponding to these curves. In the past, this geodesic has only been approximated using the method of Dynamic Programming. We show examples resulting from this algorithm. Comment: 41 pages, 12 figure...|$|R

2500|$|A {{more recent}} {{view is that}} Bateson, de Vries, Morgan and Reginald Punnett had by 1918 formed a {{synthesis}} of Mendelism and mutationism. The understanding achieved by these geneticists spanned the action of natural selection on alleles (alternative forms of a gene), the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the evolution of continuously-varying traits (like height), and {{the probability that a}} new mutation will become fixed. In this view, the early geneticists accepted natural selection but rejected Darwin's non-Mendelian ideas about variation and heredity, and the synthesis began soon after 1900. The traditional claim that Mendelians rejected the idea of continuous variation is false; as early as 1902, Bateson and Saunders wrote that [...] "If there were even so few as, say, four or five pairs of possible allelomorphs, the various homo- and hetero-zygous combinations might, on seriation, give so near an approach to a <b>continuous</b> <b>curve,</b> that the purity of the elements would be unsuspected". Also in 1902, the statistician Udny Yule showed mathematically that given multiple factors, Mendel's theory enabled continuous variation. Yule criticised Bateson's confrontational approach, but failed to prevent the Mendelians and the biometricians from falling out.|$|E

2500|$|As {{described}} in the [...] section, Isabel Myers considered {{the direction of the}} preference (for example, E vs. I) to be more important than the degree of the preference. Statistically, this would mean that scores on each MBTI scale would show a bimodal distribution with most people scoring near the ends of the scales, thus dividing people into either, e.g., an extraverted or an introverted psychological type. However, most studies have found that scores on the individual scales were actually distributed in a centrally peaked manner, similar to a normal distribution, indicating that the majority of people were actually {{in the middle of the}} scale and were thus neither clearly introverted nor extraverted. Most personality traits do show a normal distribution of scores from low to high, with about 15% of people at the low end, about 15% at the high end and the majority of people in the middle ranges. But in order for the MBTI to be scored, a cut-off line is used at the middle of each scale and all those scoring below the line are classified as a low type and those scoring above the line are given the opposite type. Thus, psychometric assessment research fails to support the concept of type, but rather shows that most people lie near the middle of a <b>continuous</b> <b>curve.</b> [...] "Although we do not conclude that the absence of bimodality necessarily proves that the MBTI developers' theory-based assumption of categorical [...] "types" [...] of personality is invalid, the absence of empirical bimodality in IRT-based research of MBTI scores does indeed remove a potentially powerful line of evidence that was previously available to [...] "type" [...] advocates to cite in defense of their position." ...|$|E

Thus, if these ivy leaves in Fig. 99 were completely drawn in light and shade, {{they would not be}} properly connected with the more or less regular sequences of the scroll; and in every subordinate ornament, something like complete symmetry may be admitted, as in bead mouldings, chequerings, &c. Also, {{the ways in which the}} transgression may be granted vary infinitely; in the finest compositions it is perpetual, and yet so balanced and atoned for as always to bring about more beauty than if there had been no transgression. In a truly fine mountain or organic line, if it is looked at in detail, no one would believe in its being a <b>continuous</b> <b>curve,</b> or being subjected to any fixed law. It seems broken, and bending a thousand ways; perfectly free and wild, and yielding to every impulse. But, after following with the eye three or four of its impulses, we shall begin to trace some strange order among them; every added movement will make the ruling intent clearer; and when the whole life of the line is revealed at last, it will be found to have been, throughout, as obedient to the true law of its course as the stars in their orbits.|$|E
