The recoiling mechanism of the gun included the tube and tube extension, recuperator piston and piston rod, lock frame assembly, driving spring assemblies, and the breechblock assembly. The nonrecoiling parts included the trunnion block group, the feed box and feeding mechanism, the recuperator cylinder and bushing, the back plate group, and the manual <b>charger</b> <b>assembly.</b>|$|E

Operational instructions include a general description of the assembly, specifications, and installation and operation. Maintenance instructions include theory of operation, preventive maintenance, repair, adjustment, and a parts list. The FRAP is intended to permit fire rescue personnel to enter a smoke-filled, toxic or oxygen depleted environment carrying their own source of breathing air. The voice amplifier assembly permits the wearer to communicate by voice with other persons in the vicinity.

50|$|The {{complete}} {{high explosive}} (HE) round {{consists of a}} fuze, the shell body, and the propellant <b>charge</b> <b>assembly.</b> The fuze is a point-detonating type, consisting of a two-piece brass body, a booster cup, a detonator holder, and a washer. The steel shell body is threaded at the top to receive the fuze assembly, and at the bottom to accommodate the propellant <b>charge</b> <b>assembly.</b> It is marked with a white band near the base, indicating {{the body of the}} shell is made of high grade steel and a red band at the nose, indicating it is filled with black powder. The propellant <b>charge</b> <b>assembly</b> consists of the percussion cap, the propellant powder, and an expanding copper rotating band. The propellant charge is ignited when the firing pin hits the percussion cap. The propellant gases expand the copper rotating band against the rifling in the interior of the barrel; the rifling causes the projectile to rotate and thus increases the accuracy of its flight. The projectile is 8.62 in long and 2.18 in inches in diameter; the complete round weighs 4 lb. The 70mm mortar was also used to launch an unusual AA mine discharger shell.|$|R

A right hand charging handle spring, lock wire and a little know how are all that are required to accomplish this.

This eliminates the need to have the weapon removed from service to accomplish this task.|$|R
50|$|The Machine Gun, 7.62-MM, M73 {{was officially}} adopted in 1959. It is an air-cooled, recoil-operated machine gun, but also using {{cartridge}} gasses to boost recoil.

The weapon is fitted with a quick-change barrel, pull-chain <b>charging</b> <b>assembly,</b> and {{can be made to}} feed from the left or the right hand side (though the left-hand feed is more common).|$|R
50|$|Later in the Vietnam War, Vietcong and North Vietnamese {{soldiers}} assigned elite sappers to stealthily penetrate {{defenses of}} sites controlled by enemy forces. Often, this meant using satchel charges {{as well as}} Bangalore torpedoes to successfully blast through barbed wire entanglements, minefields, structures, and other fortifications. The later U.S. M183 Demolition <b>Charge</b> <b>Assembly</b> contained 20 lb of C-4 in each satchel, and could be used with a timed fuse. In the Second Battle of Fallujah in Iraq, U.S. M2 20 lb assault demolitions were used to collapse houses being used as fighting positions by insurgents.|$|R

40|$|Herein we {{describe}} our {{results on the}} characterization {{of a wide variety}} of different hydrogen-bonded assemblies by means of a novel matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) technique with Ag+ labeling. The labeling technique with Ag+ ions is extremely mild and provides a nondestructive way to generate <b>charged</b> <b>assemblies</b> that can be detected by mass spectrometry. Up to now more than 25 different single (1323), double (3326), and tetrarosettes (43212) have been successfully characterized by the use of this method. The success of the method entirely depends on the presence of a suitable binding site for the Ag+ ion. A variety of functionalities has been identified that provide strong binding sites for Ag+, either acting in a cooperative way (-arene and -alkene donor functionalities) or individually (cyano and crown ether functionalities). The method works well for assemblies with molecular weights between 2000 and 8000 Da, and most likely far beyond this limit...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{experiments}} of Zweiback et al. on deuterium clusters irradiated {{with intense}} laser beams yielded D-D fusion.

For doubly charged clusters, in particular D 312 +, and plainly for more highly <b>charged</b> <b>assemblies,</b> Coulomb explosion of the cluster is in evidence. The quantum-chemical results we present strongly suggest that fragmentation occurs with small groups of deuterium atoms breaking away from the main cluster, such as to leave both small and large fragments with a net charge not exceeding +|e|.

40|$|International audienceNanohydrogels of pure chitosan, {{containing}} neither potentially toxic solvent nor chemical cross-linker, {{were obtained}} by an ammonia-induced physical gelation of a reverse emulsion of a chitosan solution in a triglyceride mixture as an organic phase. The resulting colloids were obtained with a controlled size distribution and displayed a positive surface <b>charge.</b> <b>Assemblies</b> with various macromolecules were investigated {{as a first step}} toward new nano-carriers for bioactive molecules. Chondroitin sulfate formed polyelectrolyte complexes with the positively charged surface of the nanogels, leading to negative chitosan-based colloidal hydrogels with preservation of the original average size of the dispersion. The mode of assembly of HIV- 1 p 24 protein with these colloids relied on multiple interactions between the protein and the hydrogels, irrespective of their surface charges. Anyhow, the amounts of loaded protein remained limited, suggesting a surface association. The assembly of an immunoglobulin (IgG) was markedly different from p 24. No association was detected with the positive colloidal hydrogels whereas a very high loading capacity could be obtained with the negative ones. So, this work reports that fully biodegradable sub micrometric physical hydrogels could be obtained from naturally occurring polymers. These gels could cargo a variety of biomolecules making them versatile carriers with many potential applications in Life Sciences...|$|R
