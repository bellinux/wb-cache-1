25|$|The fourth {{incident}} {{involved a}} woman who had lost an important document, and came to Swedenborg asking if a recently deceased person <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> where it was, which he (in some sources) was said to have done the following night.|$|E
500|$|On 9 December 1980 (UK time), whilst {{staying at}} Starr's ex-wife's home, she {{received}} a phone call from Starr, two hours after Lennon had been shot in New York. [...] "The memory of Ringo's words, the sound of his tearful voice crackling over the transatlantic line, is crystal clear: 'Cynthia, I'm so sorry, John's dead'. I had only one clear thought. My son, our son, [...] was at home in bed, I had to get back to Ruthin so that I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> about his father's death." ...|$|E
500|$|On 2 November at Gayhurst, {{while making}} {{preparations}} for his hunting party, Digby was visited by Gerard. [...] Having {{noticed that the}} house was almost completely empty, the Jesuit asked him if there was [...] "any matter in hand" [...] and if Garnet knew of it. [...] Keen not to implicate Gerard, despite being told less than two weeks earlier that the plot had Jesuit approval, Digby told him that there was nothing he knew of [...] "or <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> of". [...] Although Gerard later used this conversation to defend himself against those who accused him of involvement in the plot, he lived to regret not being given the opportunity to dissuade Digby from his course.|$|E
6000|$|MISS REED, breathlessly: [...] "What princely courage! What {{delicate}} magnanimity! Oh, he needn't {{have the}} LEAST fear! If I <b>could</b> only <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> that!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes; I can {{understand}} that. You <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> {{at once that}} you would take him; but you won't mind telling me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What shall I do, dear John! I can't {{bear that}} he should hear it from any one but me, and I <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>him,</b> unless we were alone.' ...|$|R
500|$|Winkelman, an ex-CBS Records {{executive}} and music promoter, {{had moved to}} the Milton Keynes area from London in 1993. He attested to a vast untapped fanbase for football in Milton Keynes—a [...] "football frenzy waiting to happen", he said. Critics of this claim pointed to the apparent lack of public interest in Milton Keynes City and the other local non-League clubs, and argued that Milton Keynes residents interested specifically in League football already had ample access with Luton, Northampton and Rushden & Diamonds all within [...] In Winkelman's own words, in a 2013 interview, he [...] "didn't have a clue about football" [...] when he was proposing to move a League club from another town—indeed looking back he said [...] "it was that naivety that enabled me to go and do it." [...] He was the only person in Milton Keynes publicly associated with the project; his financial supporters, later revealed to be Asda (a subsidiary of Walmart) and IKEA, were kept strictly anonymous. According to an investigative report by Ian Pollock, published in When Saturday Comes in July 2002, neither the Milton Keynes Council press office, the editor of the Milton Keynes Citizen newspaper nor the head of Invest in MK, the council agency encouraging businesses to move to the area, <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> who was backing the plans. Winkelman told Pollock his supporters were [...] "major business people in MK and some developers. A number of major international partners who've done this sort of thing before." ...|$|E
60|$|Life {{began to}} perplex the boy. He couldn't {{understand}} it. No one <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> anything.|$|E
60|$|He accosted {{the first}} man he met {{and asked if he}} <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> the way to Hopedale.|$|E
6000|$|What was I to say? I <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> that my {{relations}} {{with his son}} were decidedly inimical; so, after a moment's hesitation, I answered a little evasively: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A thing I <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> of, [...] Though all {{the year}} I have tried; This: never could I {{have given him}} love, [...] Even had I been his bride.|$|R
6000|$|... "And, pray, <b>could</b> you <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> more?" [...] Marian gasped in her distress. [...] "What in {{the world}} is he to us? You bring out such a thing as that this way?" ...|$|R
60|$|I was {{relieved}} when I reached M'Leod's City office, and <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> what I had done--not what I thought.|$|E
60|$|That evening, {{just before}} Rollo went to bed, he asked Jonas if he <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> why boards would only split along the grain.|$|E
6000|$|... "He rather {{gives one}} that impression, doesn't he?" [...] Jocelyn agreed. [...] "By-the-by, there wasn't much you <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> about your patient, was there?" ...|$|E
60|$|I hesitated. Should I whisper {{something}} to him? But what? His immobility {{seemed to have}} been never disturbed. What <b>could</b> I <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> he did not know already?... Finally I went on deck.|$|R
6000|$|She <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>him,</b> but she knew. She knew nearly for certain! It {{was most}} unlikely; {{circumstances}} had changed! Irene's words still rang in her head: [...] "I have left Soames. Where should I go?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And when I saw it," [...] added Eleonora, [...] "I felt I must never, never {{bring him}} into it. And how <b>could</b> I <b>tell</b> <b>him?</b> Your mother does not know, {{or she could}} not wish it!" ...|$|R
60|$|At {{her address}} {{he was told}} that Mary Snyder had moved away longer than a month before. No one <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> her new address.|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> she's a bad hard girl--one who'd poison {{any good}} man's life!" [...] my {{companion}} broke {{out with a}} passion that startled me.|$|E
60|$|None of them <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> {{any news}} of Woking except one man, who {{assured him that}} Woking had been entirely {{destroyed}} on the previous night.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell {{him where}} you lived?" [...] said Richie, evading the question; [...] "How <b>could</b> I <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> what I kendna mysell? If I had minded {{the name of}} the wynd, I need not have slept in the kirkyard yestreen." ...|$|R
60|$|His {{shorthand}} vocabulary, for a dog, was prodigious. Almost {{might it}} {{be said that}} he and the man could talk by the hour, although few and simple were the abstractions they could talk; very little of the immediate concrete past, and scarcely anything of the immediate concrete future, entered into their conversations. Jerry <b>could</b> no more <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> of Meringe, nor of the Arangi, than <b>could</b> he <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> of the great love he had borne Skipper, or of his reason for hating Bashti. By the same token, Nalasu <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> Jerry of the blood-feud with the Annos, nor of how he had lost his eyesight.|$|R
50|$|When Sean {{returned}} {{to learn of}} his wife’s death, he was devastated. Before Tom <b>could</b> even <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> {{of the existence of}} his daughter, Sean lashed out at Tom with his sonic scream for not having taken better care of Maeve.|$|R
6000|$|... 'So {{they are}} almost worse than orphans,' said Sister Constance, when the Curate went down from reading to the invalid, and she <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> the verdict.|$|E
60|$|Simon Kenton {{moved here}} and there noiselessly as a cat, intent only upon {{learning}} {{so much of what}} might be going on outside as his ears <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mr. Charles, thus urged, {{walked across}} {{the hall to the}} railing, though very reluctantly, and asked the man if he <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> why the trunks did not come.|$|E
60|$|What I {{might have}} said if he had made that inquiry a day earlier, when I was the most miserable {{creature}} living, I would rather not try to guess. Being quite happy as things were, I <b>could</b> honestly <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> I was sorry.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} answer him; I could only sob, and repeat what I had said before--that {{if it were}} anybody else I might speak, but that I <b>could</b> never <b>tell</b> <b>him.</b> Soon after that he went down-stairs, and I went to sleep.|$|R
60|$|They waited, those hungry men, three hours, till Penn reappeared with {{a smooth}} face and a blank mind. He said he {{believed}} {{that he had been}} dreaming. Then he wanted to know why they were so silent, and they <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|Un{{question}}ably Jim was suspicious, and Jet {{began to}} study {{the question of how}} much he <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him,</b> for it would soon be necessary to make some more definite explanation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, a duke's different. But {{not very}} different. This one's a {{middling}} hard {{lot for a}} duke. When he's drunk there ain't no near-sighted man <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> from a king." ...|$|E
60|$|Whither had she gone? That no mortal tongue <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him.</b> The {{darkness}} {{had covered}} her flight; {{and when the}} day broke, no man could say where the light found her.|$|E
6000|$|Lucy stifled a gasp of dismay. She {{stared at}} the wretched man. Had he forgotten? He thought that the house of his fathers was his still; and all that had parted him from it was gone from his memory. How <b>could</b> she <b>tell</b> <b>him?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|After that Paul {{told all}} his own story,--the double story, both in regard to Melmotte and to Mrs Hurtle. As {{regarded}} the Railway, Roger <b>could</b> only <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> to follow explicitly {{the advice of his}} Liverpool friend. 'I never believed in the thing, you know.' ...|$|R
5000|$|In New York, {{he found}} himself at a Jerusalem Foundation lunch next to Dorothy de Rothschild, widow of James. She <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> why his father {{suddenly}} had left Rothschild six decades earlier. But he was reassured {{that his father had}} been a [...] "wonderful man".|$|R
