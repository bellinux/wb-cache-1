50|$|One of the {{configurations}} {{of the solid}} cone spray nozzle is shown in a schematic diagram. A swirling liquid motion is induced with the vane structure, however; the discharge flow fills the entire outlet orifice. For the same capacity and pressure drop, a full <b>cone</b> <b>nozzle</b> will produce a larger drop size than a hollow <b>cone</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The coverage is the desired feature for such a nozzle, which is often used for applications to distribute fluid over an area.|$|E
50|$|More complex {{shapes of}} {{revolution}} are frequently used, such as Bell nozzles or parabolic shapes. These give perhaps 1% {{higher efficiency than}} the <b>cone</b> <b>nozzle</b> and can be shorter and lighter. They are widely used on launch vehicles and other rockets where weight is at a premium.

50|$|Selecting {{a nozzle}} {{based on the}} pattern and other spray {{characteristics}} that are required generally yields good results. Since spray nozzles are designed to perform under many different spraying conditions, more than one nozzle may meet the requirements for a given application. Surfaces may be sprayed with any pattern shape. Results are fairly predictable, {{depending on the type}} of spray pattern specified. If the surface is stationary, the preferred nozzle is usually some type of full <b>cone</b> <b>nozzle,</b> since its pattern will cover a larger area than the other styles. Spatial applications, in which the objective is not primarily to spray onto a surface, are more likely to require specialized spray characteristics. Success in these applications is often completely dependent on factors such as drop size and spray velocity. Evaporation, cooling rates for gases and solids, and cleaning efficiency are examples of process characteristics that may depend largely on spray qualities.|$|E
50|$|Full <b>cone</b> <b>nozzles</b> yield {{complete}} {{spray coverage}} in a round, oval or square shaped area. Usually the liquid is swirled within the nozzle and mixed with non-spinning liquid that has bypassed an internal vane. Liquid then exits through an orifice, forming a conical pattern. Spray angle and liquid distribution within the cone pattern {{depend on the}} vane design and location relative to the exit orifice. The exit orifice design and the relative geometric proportions also affect the spray angle and distribution.Full <b>cone</b> <b>nozzles</b> provide a uniform spray distribution of medium to large size drops resulting from their core design, which features large flow passages. Full <b>cone</b> <b>nozzles</b> are the style most extensively used in industry.|$|R
50|$|Nozzle {{type and}} capacity: Full <b>cone</b> <b>nozzles</b> {{have the largest}} drop size, {{followed}} by flat spray <b>nozzles.</b> Hollow <b>cone</b> <b>nozzles</b> produce the smallest drop size. Spraying pressure: Drop size increases with lower spraying pressure and decreases with higher pressure. Flow rate: Flow rate has a direct effect on drop size. An increase in flow rate will increase the pressure drop and decrease the drop size, while a decrease in flow rate will decrease the pressure drop and increase the drop size.|$|R

Borehole hydraulic mining has more prominent advantages than both conventional open-pit mining and underground mining.

The droplet size spectra were measured for these 15 spray mixtures using a Malvern Particle Sizer and characterised by the Volume Median Diameter (VMD) {{and the percentage of}} liquid contained in droplets less than 100 m (% < 100 m). Horizontal ground drift was measured in a wind tunnel, on glass fibre collectors using a fluorescent tracer dye technique. The relative drift of each spray mixture was characterised by the Drifted Part (DP) which is the part of the sprayed volume drifted between 2 and 6 metres. Although the nozzle type was the predominating parameter regarding to the droplet size spectra and the DP, differences were observed due to the liquids characteristics. The EC formulation produced a smaller droplet size and a greater DP than the SC formulation whatever the tank mix adjuvant used. For the different spray mixtures, the DP was poorly correlated to the VMD or the % < 100 m. However, correlations between the VMD, the % < 100 m and the DP of the flat-fan nozzle and of the hollow <b>cone</b> <b>nozzle</b> were significant.
