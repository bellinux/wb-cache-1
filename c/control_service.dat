25|$|Following {{the end of}} the Second World War, British {{troops in}} Germany were {{deployed}} along the international borders of the British zone of Allied-occupied Germany to control the flow of refugees and prevent smuggling. They were replaced in 1946 by the Frontier <b>Control</b> <b>Service,</b> a civilian frontier force administered by the British Control Commission of Germany. It went through a series of names thereafter: the Frontier <b>Control</b> <b>Service</b> from 1946–49; the Frontier Inspection Service, 1949–55; and British Frontier Service, 1955-91.|$|E
25|$|In {{a report}} {{released}} 12 May 1966 the investigating board indicated {{the main cause of}} the crash were errors made by the aircraft crew and poor organization of the airport traffic <b>control</b> <b>service.</b> Contributing factors included limited visibility in poor weather conditions and failure to properly clear the runway of snow.|$|E

On 18 March 1941 Rosaura struck a mine off Tobruk and sank to her watery grave, claiming the lives of 78 people.|$|E
25|$|Unlike in a {{few other}} {{countries}} (such as England and Wales, Portugal or Chile) there is no national regulatory agency in France that would approve tariffs and set and <b>control</b> <b>service</b> standards. There are also no regulatory agencies {{at the level of}} the Regions and Departments, unlike in US states. The economic regulation of private service provision is undertaken purely by contract through the municipality.|$|E
25|$|Following an {{inspection}} in April 2016, on 10 May, UK-based Air Safety Support International (ASSI), a subsidiary {{company of the}} Civil Aviation Authority responsible for aviation safety in Overseas Territories, issued an Aerodrome Certificate to St Helena Airport. This safety certificate indicated that airport infrastructure, aviation security measures and air traffic <b>control</b> <b>service</b> complied with international aviation safety and security standards. ASSI did not allow the airport to go into commercial operation, however, due to concerns over operational readiness of monitoring and clearing issues that include wind shear and turbulence.|$|E

25|$|In 1962, {{the runway}} was {{extended}} {{once more to}} a length of 1921 meters to facilitate DeHavilland Comet-4 turbojet aircraft operations. The terminal was also enlarged in the same year. A Control Zone was established at Kuching in November {{as a part of}} a plan to provide an Air Traffic <b>Control</b> <b>Service</b> commensurate with the growth of air traffic. Malayan Airways Limited operated the Singapore / British Borneo Territories Regional Services with Vickers Viscount and Douglas DC-3 aircraft, daily schedules linked Kuching and Sibu with Singapore on the other side, and Brunei and Borneo on the other.|$|E
25|$|In 1939, Arpha was requisitioned by the Royal Navy. She {{was used}} as an armed {{boarding}} vessel in the Mediterranean and Red Sea as part of the Contraband <b>Control</b> <b>Service.</b> For the duration of the war, Arpha was shown on Lloyd's Register as still in the ownership of Sark Motorships Ltd. In 1946, Arpha was sold to W J Brown. She was operated under the management of Worms & Co Ltd. Later that year she was sold to the Shell Co of Venezuela Ltd London, operating under the management of the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Co Ltd. She was renamed Coriano. In 1947, she was sold to the Caribbean Petroleum Co, Venezuela. Coriano was sold in 1949 to the Shell Caribbean Petroleum Co, Maracaibo. She was used to carry passengers during the construction of a refinery. In 1955, Coriano was sold to J M Perez Hernandez. She was scrapped by North American Smelting Co, Bordentown, New Jersey, arriving for scrapping on 28 October 1955.|$|E
25|$|The border {{was also}} patrolled in the British sector by the British Frontier Service (BFS), the {{smallest}} of the Western border surveillance organisations. The BFS had been established (as the Frontier <b>Control</b> <b>Service)</b> in 1946 to take over control of border crossing points from the British Army. Its personnel manned frontier control posts along all of the international and interzonal borders of the British sector, including the Danish and Dutch borders as well as the inner German border. The German customs service was re-established under BFS supervision and manned crossing points on the borders of the British zone of occupation along with BFS personnel. When German sovereignty was re-established in 1955, customs responsibilities were handed over to the Germans. A heavily reduced BFS remained in operation to serve as a liaison between British military and political interests and the German agencies on the border. One curiosity of the BFS was that despite being entirely land-based, its founding Director was a Royal Navy captain. He instituted the highly distinctive uniform of the BFS, designed in a quasi-naval style with silver rank badges. The BFS was finally disbanded in 1990 following Germany's reunification.|$|E

500|$|This [...] "cross-channel" [...] trade {{accounted}} {{for most of}} Ireland's trade. The ships ranged, in age, from Dundalk built, {{two years before the}} start of the war, in 1937 to Brooklands built in 1859. The most important vessels to Ireland were the ten colliers and to Britain the livestock carriers. Initially Germany respected the neutrality of Irish vessels, apologising for the first attack on the collier Kerry Head and paying compensation. Losses came from mines, rather than direct attacks. Meath suffered such a fate; while she was being inspected by the British Naval <b>Control</b> <b>Service,</b> she was struck by a magnetic mine, drowning seven hundred cattle, and destroying both vessels.|$|E
500|$|During the First World War, Stansfield {{served with}} the Royal Army Medical Corps, {{eventually}} as a Lieutenant-Colonel, and was appointed Consultant for Nervous and Mental Diseases to the Eastern Command (1915–22); it was thanks to these services that he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1919. Like many other superintendents, his attitude towards war patients was less than sympathetic and he was skeptical about 'shell shock', claiming that, of the 61 soldier patients admitted to Bexley, only 5 had served abroad; he thought many others were suffering from preexisting or general psychiatric problems (something he reiterated in a 1919 letter to The Times). In his words, the Board of <b>Control</b> <b>Service</b> Patient scheme to deal with war-related psychological trauma employed [...] "extravagant and unjust [...] make such a distinction between soldier patients and the hundreds of patients who are far more genuinely {{the victims of the}} battle of everyday life".|$|E
2500|$|Mechanical approaches, such as {{vacuuming}} up {{the insects}} and heat-treating or wrapping mattresses, are effective. A combination {{of heat and}} drying treatments is most effective. An hour at a temperature of [...] or over, or two hours at less than [...] kills them; a domestic clothes drier or steam kills bedbugs. Another study found 100% mortality rates for bed bugs exposed to temperatures greater than [...] for more than 2 minutes. Starving them is difficult as they can survive without eating for 100 to 300 days, depending on temperature. For public health reasons, individuals are encouraged to call a professional pest <b>control</b> <b>service</b> to eradicate bed bugs in a home, rather than attempting to do it themselves, particularly if {{they live in a}} multifamily building.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2015, local {{government}} interests (the Executive Directors of the League of California Cities, the California State Association of Counties, and the Association of California Water Agencies) filed a proposed ballot initiative with the California Attorney General {{that would have}} circumvented various constitutional protections under Proposition 218, {{including the right to}} vote on stormwater and flood control fees. [...] The initiative measure would have created an alternate funding method (other than under Proposition 218) for {{local government}}s to impose fees and charges for water service, sewer service, stormwater service, and flood <b>control</b> <b>service</b> without voter approval. [...] The proponents of the initiative measure declined to move forward after polling research revealed little support for California voters giving up Proposition 218 constitutional protections, including the right to vote on stormwater and flood control fees.|$|E
2500|$|Since the Second World War, {{scientific}} and technical progress {{and the removal of}} tenancy-based restrictions on choice of crop have given British arable farmers a great deal more freedom to plan cropping sequences. [...] Strict crop rotation is no longer technically necessary or even financially desirable. [...] Factors that influence crop sequences include the soil type, weather, the price and availability of labour and power, market outlets, and technical considerations about maintaining soil fertility and crop health. [...] For example, some vigorous crops such as kale or arable silage will, when liberally fertilised, tend to outgrow and smother weeds. [...] Many pests and diseases are crop-specific and the more often a particular crop is taken, the greater the buildup of pests and diseases that attack it. [...] The farmer will therefore try to design a sequence to sustain high yields, permit adequate weed <b>control,</b> <b>service</b> market needs, and keep the soil free from diseases and pests.|$|E
