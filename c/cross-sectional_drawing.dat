The engine looked like a radial due to the arrangement — this was evident from a <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>drawing</b> of the original version, using a master connecting rod with five additional conrods pivoted from the master rod's crankpin end casting, as with a single-row radial — but the internal workings were designed to operate more like a V engine with each adjacent pair of cylinder banks, each with a crossflow head, and it was liquid-cooled like most inlines. Looking at a complete Jumo 222 from a [...] "nose-on" [...] view, the half-dozen cylinder banks were arranged at 60° equal angles from each other, such that neighbouring banks had their exhaust ports (at the [...] "60°, 180° & 300°" [...] spaces) and intake ports (at the [...] "0°, 120° & 240°" [...] spaces) facing each other, resulting in simpler [...] "plumbing" [...] from the rear-mounted supercharger and resulting in only three sets of exhaust headers.

40|$|Western {{literature}} has repeatedly indicated {{a strong relationship}} between living alone and depression among the aged population, however, studies among the Chinese population are scarce. In this paper, we examine whether the association between living alone and depression is independent of health status, social support and financial strain among Chinese older adults, and subsequently assess whether such association persists after adjusting these variables. <b>Cross-sectional</b> data <b>drawn</b> from the Hong Kong Population Census consisting of 2, 003 Chinese elderly people aged 60 or over were analyzed. Chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses revealed that living alone results in higher levels of depressive symptoms for older women but not for older men.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the {{differences}} pertaining to the resources presently accessible for problem-based learning (PBL) among six colleges of Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach: Data for the study are the <b>cross-sectional</b> type <b>drawn</b> from 1, 020 students. Poisson and zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) models were implemented on the data to ascertain the variations regarding the extent of resources available for PBL across the colleges of the university. Findings: The study outlines the specific resources accessible for PBL across college levels of KNUST. On aggregate, 25. 7 per cent reported that their respective colleges have sufficient resources, while 74. 3 per cent indicated otherwise. The ZIP model exhibited superiority over the Poisson model, when compared under a Vuong test. As per the ZIP model, none of the colleges appeared to differ significantly in terms of having sufficient resource for PBL. Practical implications: Findings are applicable to informed decision-making which targets achieving quality education through the use of PBL. Access to sufficient resources that meet the needs of colleges or departments of a University is emphasized.

The research project justice in voluntary engagement (JIVE) integrates two established approaches and addresses the issue of justice perceptions and their relation to the willingness or unwillingness to volunteer in the social sector. The voluntary engagement is differentiated according to developed work psychological categories of activity, which are rooted in the differentiation of person- vs. object-related activity. The following five attributes characterize this project: (1) Applying the reasoned action approach and augmenting it with emotional variables; (2) Investigating explained variance of social sector voluntary engagement by innovative justice cognitions in comparison to the established antecedents volunteer functions and norm- as well as control-related cognitions; (3) Moving beyond the dichotomy of altruism vs. egoism as sole motives of prosocial behavior and revealing the complex moral motive of justice; (4) Innovatively integrating the theory of planned behavior and the volunteer functions inventory into one research instrument; (5) Building on a definition of prosocial behavior as a sustained, organized form of behavior that could possibly be remunerated.

Over the past 18 years, research has broadened its focus to the full range of potential sequelae including posttraumatic growth (PTG). The first paper presents a systematic review of the literature addressing PTG in survivors of interpersonal {{violence in}} adulthood. The evidence reviewed suggests that growth is experienced by around 70 % of survivors, and {{is by no means a}} universal phenomenon. Findings point to the therapeutic relevance of cognitive-behavioural therapy and developing individuals' social support networks. Implications for future research are discussed with an emphasis on factors associated with PTG. The second paper presents an empirical study of factors related to PTG and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in female survivors of intimate-partner violence (IPV). The internet-based questionnaire study employed an international sample of 200 women. While there may be some overlap in PTG and PTSD, the current finding suggest that the two trauma outcomes may be separate constructs.

The burgeoning of mind-body research and the widespread use of the SBC scale underscored the need for critical assessment of the instrument's measurement properties. Thus, a broader evaluation of the SBC was designed using large samples from eight international, <b>cross-sectional</b> studies <b>drawn</b> from community (i. e., non-clinical) populations.

Mean differences in body awareness were observed for males vs. females in most samples, with females generally showing higher body awareness compared to males. Multi-group structural equation modeling demonstrated a stable latent factor structure and factor loadings, indicating equivalent measurement models for males and females.

Therefore, {{the ability to}} predict such events through an established risk stratification method is of great importance. The present study was aimed at determining the risk stratification of mortality and MACE in post-PCI patients at the intensive cardiac care unit of Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital (CMH) using 7 variables of the New Mayo Clinic Risk Score (NMCRS). Method: This <b>cross-sectional</b> study <b>drew</b> upon secondary data gathered from the medical records of 313 patients that underwent PCI at the intensive cardiac care unit (ICCU) of CMH between August 1 st, 2013, and August 31 st, 2014. The primary end point was all-cause mortality and MACE. Seven variables in the NMCRS, namely age, left ventricular ejection fraction, serum creatinine, preprocedural cardiogenic shock, myocardial infarction, and peripheral arterial disease, were evaluated. Results: The mortality and MACE incidence rates in the post-PCI patients were 3. 8 % (95 %CI: 2. 6 - 5. 0) and 8. 3 % (95 % CI: 6. 6 - 10. 0), respectively. Regarding the NMCRS stratification, elderly patients with lower left ventricular ejection fraction, increased serum creatinine, preprocedural cardiogenic shock, myocardial infarction, and peripheral arterial disease had higher mortality and MACE incidence rates among the post-PCI patients. The mortality and MACE incidence rates significantly increased in the post-PCI patients with a higher NMCRS.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To use {{qualitative}} and quantitative findings to describe patterns of smoking experimentation and initiation among adolescent girls. DESIGN: Ethnographic in-person interviews, focus groups, telephone interviews, and a survey questionnaire were used over a one- year period. The paper reports on <b>cross-sectional</b> data <b>drawn</b> from a three-year longitudinal study. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: 205 girls participated in the survey and interviews during year 3 of the study. Girls were drawn from two urban high schools in Tucson, Arizona (USA), and were in grades 10 and 11 (mean ages 16 and 17, respectively) during year 3. RESULTS: Overall, 30 % (n = 61) of informants reported that they currently smoked, 7 % (n = 15) were ex-smokers, and 63 % (n = 129) were "non-smokers". The most frequently cited reasons for smoking were stress reduction and relaxation. Several stress-inducing situations, including family environment, social relations with classmates, and schoolwork, are discussed. The notion of peer pressure is re-examined {{in the light of}} teenagers' experience that there is little overt pressure to initiate smoking. Consonant with notions of adolescent autonomy, the theme of independence in smoking initiation and continuation permeated girls' narratives about their smoking behaviour. Girls projected the image that they could control their cigarettes rather than have their cigarettes control them. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking prevention and cessation programmes need to address and counter the smoking/relaxation association, which was identified as an important reason for smoking among adolescent girls. Questions typically used in surveys to measure smoking behaviour do not adequately define the smoking experience as described by teenagers. ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: To compare {{self-reported}} {{health and}} well-being {{in a sample of}} cancer survivors with individuals who have not had cancer and with individuals who have a serious chronic condition other than cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A <b>cross-sectional</b> survey <b>drawn</b> from an online panel of 400 000 UK citizens supplemented with other online recruitment and telephone recruitment. The participants were 4892 individuals 30 years of age or above, including 780 individuals with a previous cancer diagnosis, 1372 individuals with one or more of 10 chronic conditions but not cancer and 2740 individuals without a previous cancer diagnosis or chronic condition. Thirteen measures of {{health and well-being}} were constructed from answers to 25 survey items covering physical, psychological and social dimensions of health and well-being. RESULTS: Cancer survivors {{were significantly more likely to}} report poor health outcomes across all 13 measures than those with no history of cancer or a chronic condition. The adjusted odds ratios for cancer survivors with no chronic conditions compared with healthy participants ranged from 1. 37 (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 31 – 1. 96) for emotional well-being to 3. 34 (95 % CI: 2. 74 – 4. 08) for number of health professionals consulted in the last 12 months. The health profile of cancer survivors was similar to those with a history of a serious chronic health condition. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial number of individuals who have had a diagnosis of cancer experience ongoing poor health and well-being following cancer and cancer treatment. The results of this study provide an initial basis for the development of specific help and support for cancer survivors.
