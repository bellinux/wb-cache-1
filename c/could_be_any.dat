5|$|The Downing Street Declaration of 1993 allowed Sinn Féin, a {{political}} party associated with the IRA, to participate in all-party peace negotiations on condition that the IRA called a ceasefire. The IRA called a ceasefire on 31 August 1994. John Major's government, dependent on Ulster Unionist Party votes, then began insisting that the IRA must fully disarm before there <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>any</b> all-party negotiations. The IRA saw this as a demand for total surrender and believed the British were unwilling to hold negotiations. It ended its ceasefire on 9 February 1996 when it detonated a powerful truck bomb in Canary Wharf, {{one of the two}} financial districts of London. The blast killed two people and caused an estimated £150 million worth of damage. The IRA then planted five other devices in London within the space of 10weeks.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{suppose that}} M has {{dimension}} n and H acts on Rn (this <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>any</b> n-dimensional real vector space). A solder form on a principal H-bundle P over M is an Rn-valued 1-form θ: TP → Rn which is horizontal and equivariant {{so that it}} induces a bundle homomorphism from TM to the associated bundle P H Rn. This is furthermore required to be a bundle isomorphism. Frame bundles have a (canonical or tautological) solder form which sends a tangent vector X ∈ Tp'P to the coordinates of dπ'p(X) ∈ Tπ(p)M {{with respect to the}} frame p.|$|E

25|$|Chessick also {{acknowledged}} {{the dangers of}} relativism implicit in ontological hermeneutics. He acknowledges that the art and theory of interpretation is not bound by today's methods of science that aim to prevent nihilism and relativism. However, Bernstein {{has pointed out that}} there never <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>any</b> hard and fast rules or methods for interpretation because it does not aim to be a science. Gadamer states that the methods of the natural sciences are too impoverished to reveal many truths about human nature and likewise advocated for a hermeneutic approach. Others have made similar arguments for ontological hermeneutics. Chessick writes that the limitations preventing the natural sciences from uncovering certain truths about human nature is precisely why Dilthey initially advocated for a distinction between the natural and human sciences, paving the way for hermeneutics to become a method of inquiry.|$|E
25|$|It {{was first}} envisaged {{that the pilot}} <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>any</b> man or woman {{willing to take a}} {{personal}} risk. However, the first Americans to venture into space were drawn, on President Eisenhower's insistence, from a group of 508 active duty military test pilots, who were either USN or USMC naval aviation pilots (NAPs), or USAF pilots of Senior or Command rating. This excluded women, since there were no female military test pilots at the time. It also excluded civilian NASA X-15 pilot Neil Armstrong, though he had been selected by the U.S. Air Force in 1958 for its Man In Space Soonest program, which was replaced by Mercury. Although Armstrong had been a combat-experienced NAP during the Korean War, he left active duty in 1952. Armstrong became NASA's first civilian astronaut in 1962 when he was selected for NASA's second group, and became the first man on the Moon in 1969.|$|E

TouchArcade named Adventures of Mana as their [...] "Game of the Week", calling it a [...] "truly wonderful remake". Nadia Oxford at USgamer said that the game was [...] "a very decent re-construction of Final Fantasy Adventure" [...] and less tedious than Sword of Mana. Jason Schreier of Kotaku thought that the game was excellent; like Oxford, he preferred it over Sword of Mana, which he said felt more like a new game than like a remake. Harry Slater at Pocket Gamer, Musgrave, and Schreier all commented on the price, considering it to be high.|$|E
500|$|Jesse Hassenger of PopMatters {{found the}} finale to be [...] "breathlessly paced". However, the writer was also {{dissatisfied}} with the cliffhanger, and hoped that the second season would not increase the series' focus on Veronica's relationships. Hassenger wrote, [...] "so far, the series has eschewed the relationship angst so common in other teen-centric shows; Neptune hearts get broken, yes, but the show never stoops to that will-they-or-won't-they dynamic. Veronica is that rare television character who's too interesting for love triangles." [...] Filip Vukcevic of IGN thought that while {{the resolution of the}} murder was satisfying, it could have been better; [...] "I liked the way everything played out, but I didn't get the Sixth Sense moment I was hoping for. I wanted the season finale to blow my mind, instead all it got out of me was, 'Ah, I see. That's cool.'" [...] Vukcevic wrote that the pace of the season increased exponentially, and was at its best during the final episode. Both reviewers praised Rob Thomas's use of red herrings. Vukcevic felt that [...] "as the finale approaches you are led to believe that the murderer <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>any</b> one of several different people - not any easy thing to pull off convincingly. What makes good TV is audience participation. If you feel for a character or are puzzling out a mystery, you're involved. And when you're involved, you're having a good time." [...] Hassenger cited Lianne, Duncan and Logan as the main red herrings.|$|E

500|$|All of the {{interior}} scenes were shot at sound stages inside Kling Studios. Most of the exterior shots were filmed at Bronson Canyon, a set of caves at Griffith Park in Los Angeles that was a popular shooting location for low-budget films. The exterior scenes of the tracking station were shot at a television station on Mount Lee, {{not far from the}} Hollywood Sign. Varno said it was the first television station built in Los Angeles, but was only being used for emergency broadcasts when Blood Beast was filmed; it had also been used during World War II to send information and propaganda to the Allied Forces' overseas allies. Varno secured permission to film there simply by calling the city of Los Angeles and asking permission, something he said nobody else considered trying because they assumed the city would not allow it. Varno was familiar with the station because his father, Roland Varno, appeared in the first dramatic television show released in Los Angeles and it was transmitted from that station. For the Blood Beast shoot, Los Angeles charged a fee of $8 per actor to shoot at the station, but the crew <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>any</b> size. All shooting took place outside the station and none inside. Most of the station night scenes there were shot during the day, and the film crew often had to find shadows to shoot in or block out the sun to give the impression of nighttime. Gene Corman said of the shooting: [...] "That was one of the more mobile units I've ever been involved with. Normally, everybody chases the sun; we were chasing the shadows." ...|$|E
