30|$|Typically, {{during the}} deposition, a target should be rotated {{to achieve a}} stable {{ablation}} rate. As PLD is usually carried out at high substrate temperatures, a thin oxide layer might be formed on the substrate surface prior to the deposition of calcium orthophosphates and, thereby, it influences its adherence to the substrate (Nelea et al. 2000). The deposited coatings, layers and films frequently consist of several calcium orthophosphates (often with admixtures of other substances, such as CaO, <b>calcium</b> <b>pyrophosphates,</b> etc.) and might contain both amorphous and crystalline phases (Cleries et al. 2000 a; Koch et al. 1990). Biphasic formulations, such as HA[*]+[*]TTCP (Kim et al. 2005 b), might be deposited as well. Interestingly, TTCP in the coatings was not formed by partial conversion of previously deposited HA. Instead, it was produced by nucleation and growth of TTCP itself from the ablation products of the HA target or by accretion of TTCP grains formed during ablation (Kim et al. 2005 b). Furthermore, the PLD-deposited coatings, films and layers might consist of calcium orthophosphates with different morphologies (e.g., granular and columnar), which have different resistance values to delamination (Cleries et al. 2000 a). More to the point, various types of oriented textures might be created as well (Kim et al. 2005 a, 2007 a, 2010). A modification known as ‘transmission laser coating’ has been introduced (Cheng and Ye 2010).|$|R
30|$|It is {{important}} to stress that, among the deposited lamellae, there are small voids, such as pores, cracks and regions of incomplete bonding. Due to such inhomogeneous structure, the deposits can have properties {{significantly different from the}} initial bulk materials (Fauchais 2004). In addition, due to both very high processing temperatures (leading to dehydroxylation of HA and partial decomposition of any other material) followed by rapid solidification, various admixtures and metastable phases are usually present in the deposits. For example, in the case of plasma spraying of calcium orthophosphates, complicated mixtures of various phases (high temperature ACP, α-TCP, β-TCP, HA, OA, TTCP) with other compounds, such as <b>calcium</b> <b>pyrophosphates,</b> <b>calcium</b> metaphosphates, CaO, etc. are obtained (Cao et al. 2010 a; Zyman et al. 1993; Weng et al. 1993; Zyman et al. 1994; Tong et al. 1995; McPherson et al. 1995; Yang et al. 1995; Tong et al. 1998; Park et al. 1998; Gross et al. 1998 a; Gross et al. 1998 b; Heimann and Wirth 2006; Roy et al. 2011). Thus, the chemical and phase compositions of the final coatings, films and layers are dependent on the thermal history of the powder particles. This leads to variable solubility of the deposited coatings, films and layers, dictated by the amounts of more soluble phases, such as ACP. Furthermore, the distribution of by-product and metastable phases in the coatings, films and layers appears to be inhomogeneous. For example, the coating crystallinity was reported to be lower at the interface with the Ti substrate than at the surface of the coating. This happened because metals had a higher rate of thermal diffusivity than calcium orthophosphates and, thus, the cooling rate of the first layer was faster (Gross et al. 1998 b). Besides, residual stresses in the plasma sprayed coatings, films and layers were found and measured (Valter et al. 1997; Tsui et al. 1998; Yang et al. 2000; 2003 c; Yang and Chang 2005; Carradó 2010; Yang 2011).|$|R

Orthophosphate, <b>pyrophosphate,</b> polyphosphate and two polymeric phosphate inhibitors of phosphatases did not inhibit the resorption of calvaria or the rise in plasma calcium. In contrast, several phosphonates containing P-C-P bonds retarded the dissolution of hydroxyapatite crystals in vitro, and, at concentrations down to 1. 6 × 10 - 6 M, inhibited bone resorption in tissue culture. Some diphosphonates also inhibited the rise in plasma calcium in thyroparathyroidectomised rats. One reason for the difference between the effects of compounds containing P-O-P and P-C-P bonds may be related to the greater resistance of the latter to chemical and enzymic hydrolysis. Phosphonates may provide a model for the effect of endogenous PP 1 in bone, and might be of use in elucidating provide a model for the effect of endogenous PP 1 in bone, and might be of use in elucidating mechanisms of bone formation and resorption and in the therapy of diseases that involve increased resorption of bone. © 1970 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
40|$|Site-directed {{mutagenesis}} of a thermostable alkaline phytase from Bacillus sp. MD 2 {{was performed}} with an aim {{to increase its}} specific activity and activity and stability in an acidic environment. The mutation sites are distributed on the catalytic surface of the enzyme (P 257 R, E 180 N, E 229 V and S 283 R) and in the active site (K 77 R, K 179 R and E 227 S). Selection of the residues {{was based on the}} idea that acid active phytases are more positively charged around their catalytic surfaces. Thus, a decrease in the content of negatively charged residues or an increase in the positive charges in the catalytic region of an alkaline phytase was assumed to influence the enzyme activity and stability at low pH. Moreover, widening of the substrate-binding pocket is expected to improve the hydrolysis of substrates that are not efficiently hydrolysed by wild type alkaline phytase. Analysis of the phytase variants revealed that E 229 V and S 283 R mutants increased the specific activity by about 19 % and 13 %, respectively. Mutation of the active site residues K 77 R and K 179 R led to severe reduction in the specific activity of the enzyme. Analysis of the phytase mutant-phytate complexes revealed increase in hydrogen bonding between the enzyme and the substrate, which might retard the release of the product, resulting in decreased activity. On the other hand, the double mutant (K 77 R-K 179 R) phytase showed higher stability at low pH (pH 2. 6 - 3. 0). The E 227 S variant was optimally active at pH 5. 5 (in contrast to the wild type enzyme that had an optimum pH of 6) and it exhibited higher stability in acidic condition. This mutant phytase, displayed over 80 % of its initial activity after 3 h incubation at pH 2. 6 while the wild type phytase retained only about 40 % of its original activity. Moreover, the relative activity of this mutant phytase on <b>calcium</b> phytate, sodium <b>pyrophosphate</b> and p-nitro phenyl phosphate was higher than that of the wild type phytase.

40|$|Phytase is an {{important}} enzyme in the food/feed industry. It catalyzes the hydrolysis of phytate, an anti-nutrient compound present in cereals and grains, to release orthophosphate and myo-inositol- 6 -phosphate with lower degrees of phosphorylation. Phytic acid is a strong chelator capable of complexing {{with a variety of}} metal ions under neutral and alkaline conditions, as well as with proteins and starch under acidic conditions. Treatment with phytase increases not only the bioavailability of inorganic phosphorus but also the digestibility of proteins. Moreover, it improves absorption of minerals from food/feed. The action of phytase also contributes towards reducing the pollution in surface- and ground water caused by the phytate and phosphorus run-off from manure in intensive livestock regions. All the commercially available phytases are histidine acid phytases with optimum activities at low pH and with low thermostabilities. Alkaline phytases (also called β-propeller phytases) are active at neutral or slightly alkaline conditions, calcium-dependent, and are quite thermostable so as to withstand the high temperatures during the pelleting of animal feeds. They can hence exhibit activities in the small intestine of animals as well as during storage of feeds. Alkaline phytases have several other potential applications. This thesis presents the studies on a phytase from Bacillus sp. MD 2 isolated in Vietnam. The focus has been directed to (1) developing a new kinetic method to determine the phytase activity, (2) cloning, expression and production of the recombinant phytase from Bacillus sp. MD 2, (3) the metal dependence of the catalytic properties and stability of the recombinant phytase, and (4) site-directed mutagenesis of the recombinant phytase to improve certain properties of the enzyme relevant for food/feed applications. A kinetic assay for phytases has been developed based on the turbidity reduction of phytate-protein complexes used as substrates. This method offered a reliable way to measure the enzyme activity of both histidine acid phytases and ß-propeller phytases. The method was found to be simpler, faster, and to measure the activity under conditions closer to those existing in the gastrointestinal tract of animals, thus making it more suitable for evaluating phytases for feed and food applications in comparison with the traditional method based on the release of phosphate from sodium phytate. The phytase gene from Bacillus sp. MD 2 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Cultivation of the recombinant bacteria in a minimum medium using a fed-batch strategy combined with the control of the inorganic phosphate concentration resulted in a high level of production of the recombinant phytase. Lactose could be used as an alternative inducer to isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside, thus reducing the production cost. A significant amount of the expressed phytase (90 % of the total active enzyme) leaked out into the medium, thereby facilitating the subsequent downstream processing. A close investigation of the effect of divalent metal ions on the activity and stability of the recombinant phytase was performed. Calcium {{played a critical role in}} stabilizing the enzyme and in activating the substrate (phytate) to fulfil the activity of the enzyme. Other metal ions (Ba 2 +, Mn 2 +, Mg 2 + and Sr 2 +) could replace Ca 2 + in the active site of the enzyme and recover more than 90 % of the enzyme activity with the calcium complex substrate. On the other hand, the presence of Ca 2 + on the phytate was crucial for an optimal expression of the phytase activity. The relationship between structure and function of the phytase was probed by site-directed mutagenesis. Single site mutations, S 283 R and E 229 V, on the catalytic surface increased the specific activity of the enzyme by 13 and 19 %, respectively. Mutation of the catalytically important residue E 227 to Ser shifted the optimum pH of the enzyme to the acidic side and simultaneously improved its acid stability. After 3 h of incubation at pH 2. 6, the mutant phytase (E 227 S) retained over 80 % of its initial activity while the wild-type phytase displayed only 40 % of its original activity. Moreover, the E 227 S mutant phytase, unlike its wild-type, showed a higher relative activity towards <b>calcium</b> phytate, sodium <b>pyrophosphate</b> and p-nitro phenyl phosphate, thus suggesting a broader substrate specificity. Alkaline phytases have a lower specific activity than their acid counterparts. An increased knowledge of the enzymes for designing mutations to improve their specific activity and catalytic activity at low pH are thus necessary for rendering industrial applications possible...|$|R
