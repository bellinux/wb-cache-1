The company introduced a competition for pet owners to win a part-time job earning $50,000 annually to travel with their cat, interview other pet owners and write for the Purina website. Nestle Purina also produced television advertisements intended for Austria that had audio effects only pets <b>could</b> <b>hear.</b> <b>It</b> was {{the first set of}} advertisements targeting pets directly, rather than their owners.|$|E
25|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the senechal's unpopularity, Raymond went to visit the king at Jerusalem and laid claim to the regency in August. He argued that he was both the closest male relative and the most powerful vassal of the child king. He also emphasized that he had appointed the king's father to administer Tripoli during his captivity {{for which he was}} entitled to claim the same treatment. Miles of Plancy postponed the decision about Raymond's claim, stating that only the plenary session of the High Court of Jerusalem <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
500|$|On the Sgt. Pepper album, {{the start}} of [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] is {{cross-faded}} with the applause {{at the end of}} the previous track [...] "Sgt.

Pepper cross-fade, but on [...] and the CD version of 1967–1970, the song starts cleanly, without any fade or cross-fade. Also, the [...] "1967–1970" [...] CD does not have the sped up ending, and instead it just ends after the E Major chord has faded enough so nobody <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

500|$|American {{producers}} Tricky Stewart and Dream {{had written}} the track [...] "Umbrella" [...] in 2007 with pop singer Britney Spears in mind. Her label rejected the song before she <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it,</b> stating they had enough songs for her to record; at the time, Spears was working on her fifth studio album Blackout. The producers then reached out to Mary J. Blige, {{who did not have}} time to consider the song for her next album. Finally, L.A. Reid, then-CEO of Def Jam Recordings, bought the record and forwarded it to Rihanna. Initially, Stewart was unsure whether Rihanna was the right artist for the song, but after they had recorded the [...] "ella, ella" [...] catch phrase for the track, he felt optimistic. Rapper Jay Z added rap vocals. Stewart also co-wrote and produced [...] "Breakin' Dishes" [...] with Nash.|$|E
500|$|Philip and Mary Ann Hobel spent a {{long time}} seeking a {{distributor}} for Tender Mercies without any success. Duvall, who began to doubt the film would be widely released, was unable to help the Hobels because he was busy trying to find a distributor for Angelo My Love, a film he had written, directed and produced. Eventually, Universal Pictures agreed to distribute Tender Mercies. Test screenings for the film were held, which Beresford described as the most unusual he had ever experienced. The director said that the preview audiences appeared to be very engaged with the picture, to the point the theaters were so silent, [...] "if you flicked a piece of paper on the floor, you <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> fall." [...] However, the post-screening feedback was, in Beresford's words, [...] "absolutely disastrous." [...] As a result, Universal executives lost faith in the film and made little effort to promote it. Foote said of the studio, [...] "I don't know that they disliked the film, I just think they thought it was inconsequential and of no consequence at all. I guess they thought it would just get lost in the shuffle." [...] Others in the film industry were equally dismissive; one Paramount Pictures representative described the picture as [...] "like watching paint dry".|$|E
2500|$|I'd {{been getting}} {{bored with the}} stereotyped changes that were being used, ... and I kept {{thinking}} there's bound to be something else. I <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> sometimes. I couldn't play it.... I was working over 'Cherokee,' and, as I did, I found that by using the higher intervals of a chord as a melody line and backing them with appropriately related changes, I could play the thing I'd been hearing. It came alive—Parker.|$|E

2500|$|Andy Weller of the Necros {{recalls the}} band's {{transition}} from traditional punk {{rock in the}} late 1970s to hardcore in the early 1980s: [...] "ou <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> on the records. It went from this Ramones-type stuff, to nine months later, where they put out records that were so fast it's unreal." [...] By the recording of Earth A.D./Wolfs Blood the band were playing faster, more aggressive material. According to Blush, [...] "The Misfits' strengths as a hardcore group lay in non- attributes–melodic songs and larger-than-life-aura–but {{by the time of}} Earth A.D. Glenn was writing hyperspeed blasts that sounded very standard." ...|$|E
2500|$|The North Carr Lightship was {{launched}} in 1932 and created quite a stir in Edinburgh on account of her fog horn being tested while lying ¾ mile off Granton, Edinburgh in the Firth of Forth. As the fog horn had a range of approximately 10 miles, north Edinburgh <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> loud and clear and the complaints were numerous - particularly as it was being sounded in clear weather. [...] "Hundreds of city dwellers have had no sleep over three consecutive nights" [...] and [...] "The most flagrant individual breach of the peace is as nothing compared with the ceaseless boom and consequent suffering {{of the past three}} nights" [...] were typical statements at the time.|$|E
2500|$|Europe {{entered an}} arms race to build ever larger {{artillery}} pieces. Burgundy's guns continued to develop, {{and in the same}} year that Odruik fell, Philip's smith constructed a gun capable of shooting balls weighing 200 kilograms. In 1382 an [...] "incredibly huge bombard" [...] was aimed at Oudenaarde, its muzzle 60 inches around and 20 inches in diameter. One observer described it thus, [...] "One <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> for five leagues in the daytime, and ten leagues at night, and it made such a huge noise that … it seemed as though all the demons of hell were present." [...] By the early 15th century both French and English armies were equipped with larger pieces known as bombards, weighing up to 5 tons (4,535kg) and firing balls weighing up to 300lbs (136kg). In 1404 a cannon was created with the inscription, [...] "I am named Katrin. Beware of what I hold. I punish injustice." [...] In 1411 the cast iron cannon Faule Mette was created, and it was capable of shooting stone balls weighing 400 kilograms, but didn't very often. The artillery trains used by Henry V of England in the 1415 Siege of Harfleur and 1419 Siege of Rouen proved effective in breaching French fortifications, while artillery contributed to the victories of French forces under Joan of Arc in the Loire Campaign (1429). It wasn't just the English blasting their way through France either. Burgundy started by battering down the walls of Vellexon in 1409 and in 1411 they took Ham with only three shots from their bombard Griette. France eventually came around under the reforms of King Charles V (1422-1461), whose leadership made France the premier artillery force in Europe, and won the Hundred Years' War. Gun developments in France would prove extremely effective during the Italian wars of the 1490s. In 1431 a wrought-iron cannon was forged, weighing over 12,000 kilograms and could fire projectiles of 300 kilograms. It was called the Dulle Griet. These weapons were transformational for European warfare. A hundred years earlier the Frenchman Pierre Dubois wrote that a [...] "castle can hardly be taken within a year, and even if it does fall, it means more expenses for the king's purse and for his subjects than the conquest is worth," [...] but by the 15th century European walls fell with the utmost regularity.|$|E
