40|$|Minerals of the tobermorite {{group with}} double [Al 3 ++Na+] substitutions were {{synthesized}} using both, non-ground raw mineral mixtures and mixtures {{ground in a}} <b>colloidal</b> <b>mill.</b> The synthesis of calcium sili-cate hydrate is more effective when dry primary mixtures ground in a <b>colloidal</b> <b>mill</b> are taken, because compositions of higher degree of crystallinity are synthesized under the same conditions. In the latter case, tobermorite is formed after 24 h. It is thought that grinding a mixture of CaO, SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 in a <b>colloidal</b> <b>mill</b> induces activation centres which later activate synthesis via hydrothermal processing. It is reasonable to grind dry reactants used for synthesising tobermorite in a <b>colloidal</b> <b>mill</b> before hydrothermal processing. Under our experimental conditions, tobermorite was formed more effectively when the spe-cific surface was lower than 547 m 2 ·kg – 1. Use of finer particles of reactants does not enhance the reac-tion rate because of the stabilising influence of (0. 8 – 1. 5) CaO·SiO 2 ·(0. 5 – 2. 5) H 2 O (C–S–H (I)) on the overall reaction rate of the synthesis of tobermorite.

Not only the physicochemical properties of these samples but also of an industrial reference were compared and discussed {{in order to understand}} tahini behavior and structure. Granulometry was determined by a laser-scattering analyzer and revealed for all studied samples, trimodal {{particle size}} distributions. Histogram modes, as well as cumulative volume percentages (CVPs) of smal l- and middle-class populations, increased with the number of passes through <b>colloidal</b> <b>mill,</b> while for large particle size population, both the modes and CVPs decreased. Pseudoplastic behavior was observed for all sunflower tahini prototypes and reference, irrespective of studied temperature and particle size. However, the value of consistency coefficient ranged from 3, 049 to 6. 6 Pa·s n being strong dependent on particle size and temperature while flow behavior indexes between 0. 53 and 0. 87. Time-dependent rheological analysis revealed higher thixotropic degree of coarser sunflower tahini samples. Studied samples had rheological properties characteristic for a viscoelastic mate- rial, the response in the dynamic frequency sweep being typical for weak gels. The finest sunflower tahini prototype showed the lowest Krieger–Dougherty estimated volume fraction (0. 48), while the coarsest sample the highest (0. 69), sunflower tahini reference being placed in a median position with a volume fraction of 0. 56.

40|$|Increasing {{demands for}} {{efficient}} energy storage in microelectronics has pushed {{the scientific community}} towards finding suitable materials that can effectively deliver high pulse power in miniaturized systems. Polymer-ceramic composites {{are considered to be}} one possible solution towards the fabrication of high energy density capacitors, whether as embedded capacitors or gate insulators in organic field effect transistors (OFETs). Selecting high permittivity ceramics mixed with polymers with high breakdown field strengths would be the wisest approach towards enhancing energy storage. As such, novel ferroelectric polymers such as P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE) are being developed and researched, all displaying record dielectric values (K > 50) as promising candidates for high energy density composite capacitors (> 25 J/cm 3). However, much work is still needed to understand the interaction mechanisms between the phases. We aim to seek an understanding of the processing challenges, especially in terms of fabricating thin film ferroelectric polymers and their application in nanocomposite capacitors while effectively maintaining optimized performance when embedded in flexible electronics. A process for synthesizing high performance P(VDF-TrFE) thin films is developed realizing the importance of controlling several process parameters to achieve high quality devices. Electrical and physicochemical characterization demonstrate how the performance of the polymer films improves with prolonged annealing periods by allowing sufficient time for solvent evaporation, crystallization and preferential-orientation of the crystallites. The polymer P(VDF-TrFE) is then used as a host material with barium titanate (BTO) nanoparticles below 100 nm (K = 150) as a ceramic filler in nanocomposite films. Facile surface modification by hydroxylation proved to be essential in the performance of the devices in terms of leakage current. A decrease of approximately 2 orders of magnitude in current leakage is recorded in surface modified BTO displaying potential for higher breakdown strength. Besides developing a process for P(VDF-TrFE) and low leakage composites, the importance of dispersion techniques and filler loadings are also discussed.

40|$|Sunflower halva is an {{appreciated}} product, but shows {{currently a}} quality below {{the expectations of}} the new generation of consumers, having a hard texture and oil exuded on the surface (low stability). The aim of this work was to assess the influence of tahini particle size on sunflower halva texture and stability. Eight different particle size sunflower tahini samples were produced at pilot plant scale, the higher the number of passes through the <b>colloidal</b> <b>mill,</b> the smaller the particle size (P 1 - coarsest → P 8 - finest). Halva prototypes (25 g / piece), including also an industrial sample (H 0), were obtained at laboratory scale by mixing the nougat with tahini. The texture was evaluated on Stable micro systems TA. HD Plus texture analyzer equipped either with a cylinder probe or with a blade set. All samples were stored for 60 days at 4 °C, room temperature (~ 25 °C) or 40 °C. During storage, the colloidal stability of all samples was assessed by a gravimetric technique. Tahini samples P 6 → P 8 were not suitable for halva production while due to the low viscosities, the product was impossible to be shaped. Among obtained sunflower halva prototypes (H 1 → H 5) it was shown that decreasing tahini particle size decreased sunflower halva hardness and stability. For each sample, the increase of storage temperature decreased sunflower halva stability. Sunflower halva H 3 was the most efficient, while was more stable and showed smaller hardness values than H 0...|$|E
40|$|The {{overall goal}} of the present PhD thesis was to study some factors related to the choice of {{emulsifier}} (whey protein isolate or sodium caseinate) concentration, oil-phase volume fractions (10 - 50 %) and homogenization conditions (100 - 300 MPa) that could influence physical stability and lipid oxidation in nano/submicron oil-in-water emulsions by using a rotor-startor system (<b>colloidal</b> <b>mill,</b> CM, at 5000 rpm for 5 min) for obtaining the coarse emulsions and stabilized by ultra high-pressure homogenization (UHPH), in comparison to conventional homogenization (CH, 15 MPa). Emulsions were characterized for their physical properties (droplet size distribution, microstructure, surface protein concentration, emulsifying stability against creaming and coalescence, and viscosity) and oxidative stability (hydroperoxide content and TBARs) under light (2000 lux/m 2 for 10 days). The first study focused on using whey protein isolate (WPI) as emulsifier in different concentrations (1, 2 and 4 %) with a fixed oil concentration (20 %) of sunflower and olive oils (3 : 1). UHPH produced emulsions with lipid particles of small size in the sub-micron range (100 - 200 nm) and low surface protein with unimodal distribution in emulsions treated at 200 MPa using whey proteins at 4 %. Long term physical stability against creaming and coalescence was observed in UHPH emulsions, compared to those obtained by CM and CH. Oxidative stability of emulsions was also improved by UHPH compared to CM and CH, especially when 100 MPa was applied. All emulsions exhibited Newtonian behavior (n ≈ 1). These results led us to use the best conditions obtained in the previous work (4 % of protein concentration and pressure treatments of 100 and 200 MPa) to study the physical and oxidative stability of emulsions containing different oil-phase volume fractions (10, 30 and 50 %). Increasing the oil concentration from 10 to 50 %, in general, increased the particle size, decreased the surface protein concentration and resulted in {{a high degree of}} flocculation and coalescence, especially in emulsions treated at 200 MPa. All UHPH emulsions, except those treated at 100 MPa containing 10 % oil, and CH emulsions with 50 % oil displayed an excellent stability vs. creaming during storage at ambient temperature. The lowest oxidation rate was observed in UHPH emulsions, especially those containing 30 % oil. The third study was conducted on using sodium caseinate (SC) as emulsifier in different concentrations (1, 3 and 5 %) with a fixed oil concentration (20 %) of sunflower and olive oils (3 : 1). UHPH emulsions containing 1 % protein presented a high particle size (especially in emulsions treated at 100 MPa) but increasing the protein content to 3 and 5 % in UHPH emulsions reduced the particle size, and tended to change the rheological behaviour from Newtonian to shear thinning, improving the creaming and oxidative stabilities of emulsions. From the previous study, the best droplet breakdown, physical and oxidative stability were obtained with pressures in the range of 200 and 300 MPa and sodium caseinate (5 %). Therefore, the objective of the last study was to evaluating the emulsions containing different oil-phase volume fractions (10, 20, 30 and 50 %) treated by UHPH in the conditions above mentioned, in comparison to CH emulsions containing 1 and 5 % SC. Increasing the oil content to 50 % tended to produce emulsions with a gel structure such as a mayonnaise type product so, {{the results of this study}} focused only on emulsions containing 10, 20 and 30 % oil. CM and CH emulsions containing 1 % SC and different oil contents (10, 20 and 30 %), exhibited a Newtonian flow behavior with a slow creaming rate, whereas the oxidation rate was faster in these emulsions. On the other hand, high degree of flocculation with a shear thinning behavior, higher creaming rates, but low oxidation rates were observed in CH emulsions containing 5 %. UHPH-treated emulsions containing high oil contents (20 and 30 %) exhibited excellent creaming stability, and with a shear thinning rheological behavior only in emulsions containing 30 % oil. UHPH produced stable emulsions against oxidation, especially when high oil contents (20 - 30 %) were used. Increasing the oil concentration from 10 to 30 %, in general, resulted in an increase in the oxidative stability in all emulsions, except in CH emulsions containing 1 % of SC. Emulsions produced by both whey protein (4 %) and caseinate (5 %), and treated by UHPH have a good physical stability to flocculation, coalescence and creaming and also high stability to lipid oxidation, opening a wide range of opportunities in the formulation of emulsions containing bioactive components with lipid nature...|$|E

40|$|Preface Motivation {{in short}} {{for this book}} o Emulsions are used widely and {{produced}} in large volumes. Thus, emulsion formation or emulsification is an important unit-operation. o Emulsification is of interest for a broad audience, both because of its influence on the functionality of emulsion based products, {{and because it is}} generally energy intensive running at low efficiency. o Today, there is no comprehensive treatment available in English of emulsification describing state-of the-art technology and bringing together aspects from physical chemistry, formulation, fluid mechanics and chemical engineering. Together these aspects are the foundation needed for understanding emulsification at more than a rudimentary level. Emulsions and Emulsification Emulsions {{can be found in a}} wide variety of food products such as in milk, cream, spreads, ice-creams, dressings and sauces. Emulsions are also common in many related areas such as in pharmaceuticals (e. g. topical formulation and nutritional emulsions) and in many house hold products (e. g. paints and cosmetics). Emulsions bring many different forms of functionality to these products via their drops. Emulsion drops can be used to design bulk properties such as appearance, solubilization, mouth-feel, rheology, electrical properties and much more. Emulsions can also been used for bringing highly specific functionality to products such as in controlled delivery and in release of pharmaceuticals, in increasing bioavailability of nutrients, and in delivering flavor. All the above mentioned product properties are highly influenced by the characteristics of the emulsion. Emulsion character includes many different aspects such as drop size distribution and structure, type and amount of adsorbed emulsifiers etc. The properties of a given emulsion influenced to a large extent by the emulsification process through which it was created. Intensity and spatial/temporal distribution of the applied energy, time allowed for adsorption of surface active material and type of force acting to destabilize the interface will all influence the properties of the final emulsion. Hence, creating functional emulsions requires a fundamental and general understanding of the involved physical-chemical processes as well as specific information about the limits and possibilities for the different types of emulsifying equipment. Emulsions are produced in large quantities. As an example approximately 270 million tons of liquid dairy products are annually treated with high-pressure homogenization (Tetra Pak Dairy Index Report, 2011). Emulsification is also a rather energy demanding unit operation, in absolute terms and particularly in relation to the theoretical energy requirements. The thermodynamically required energy for creating an emulsion is determined by the increase in free energy due to surface energy. For drops of a micrometer diameter this would amount to order of magnitude 103 J/m 3, whereas the actual energy requirement for high-pressure homogenization is of order 107 J/m 3. Taking the example of the dairy market this would correspond to roughly 600 GWh of energy of which only 0. 01 % is needed from a thermodynamic view. The conclusion from these large volumes and low efficiency must be that even a small incremental improvement in process operation would lead to substantial savings. Thus, there is a broad and large demand for better understanding emulsification processes. The low thermodynamic efficiency is characteristic to all the high-energy methods such as rotor-stator based technologies, high-pressure homogenizers, microfluidization, ultra sonic systems and <b>colloidal</b> <b>mills.</b> Alternative low-energy flow processes, such as membrane based technology, have a higher efficiency but have not been able to reach the same productivity and extremely small drops as in the high energy technologies. However, the methods are developed continuously and an up to date comparison is much in need. The emulsification process The outcome of an emulsification process is generally a combination of two competing processes; disruption of the drop interface from dynamic destabilizing forces and thermodynamically driven coalescence. Studying the processes one at a time is not uncomplicated; the coupling is highly complex and poorly understood. Emulsification also encompasses a large range of time-scales, from the very fast velocity fluctuations in high-pressure homogenization (100 MHz), ultrasonication (100 kHz), the adsorption times of surfactants (1 MHz) and macromolecular emulsifiers to the slower process of shear and drop detachment and all the way to the equilibrium thermodynamics which determines the long term fate of every emulsion. From the discussion above it is clear that emulsification is truly a multidisciplinary phenomenon and an understanding must therefore spring from the combination of (at least) three different scientific specializations: • Physical chemists have long studied interfaces between liquids and their relation to surface active molecules. This will be key aspects in the process of coalescence as well as understanding how surface active agents can aid in disruption. • Fluid mechanics has developed theoretical and experimental methods for understanding the interplay between hydrodynamic forces and the drop interface. This is vital for understanding how differences in design can bring about different emulsification results. • Research in chemical engineering has led to relations between operating conditions and emulsion characteristics and devised methods for measuring fragmentation or coalescence rates in bulk. This has obvious practical importance, but can also be used for comparison to the predictions from the more fundamental disciplines. A comprehensive discussion on emulsification methods and their application must bring together aspects from all these different specialties. The need for new literature on emulsification The present literature on emulsification is to a large degree is influenced by the abovementioned division between the different topics. Many of the more general text books on surface and colloidal chemistry contains chapters on emulsions (e. g. Cosgrove, 2010; Goodwin, 2004; Holmberg et al., 2003). There is also a rather voluminous literature on emulsions per se, both in general (e. g. Sjöblom, 2006; Binks, 1998; Becher, 1983) and for food applications (McClements, 2005; Friberg & Larsson, 1997; Dickinson & Stainsby, 1992). These do, however, to a large extent focus on the physiochemical aspects of emulsions and the emulsification process in itself is not treated in sufficient detail. Similarly, books from the fluid dynamics section dealing with multiphase flow sometimes discuss implications on drop formation (e. g. Clift et al., 1978), however without the coupling to technical considerations/design and the advances in physical chemistry. Steps towards this synthesis of different aspects can be found in the older literature (e. g. Gopal, 1968) and substantial advances were made by Walstra in a series of book chapters and review articles during the 80 : ies and 90 : ies (Walstra, 1983; Walstra, 1993; Walstra & Smulders, 1998), however, these works are now beginning to be outdated especially in relation to the coupling between process design and obtained emulsification result. Today, there is no comprehensive treatment of emulsification including state-of-the art developments and integration of all three aspects available in English. This book is aimed at filling that gap. The perspective will be that of the unit emulsification process, using fundamental theory from different fields to discuss design and function of different emulsification techniques.
