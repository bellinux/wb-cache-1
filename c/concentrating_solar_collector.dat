The SkyTrough is the first utility scale solar concentrator to use polymer reflectors rather than glass mirrors. The use of the polymer mirror allows the reflector to be made as one continuous large panel, which is lighter than glass mirrors and therefore the support frame can also be lighter. The SkyTrough system can be deployed in a stand-alone configuration for utility-scale electricity generation. It can also be integrated with fossil fuel power plants, such as natural gas-fired combined cycle power plants, to augment or displace some of the host plant’s steam production or, {{in the case of}} traditional coal plants, to provide feed-water heating. SkyTrough systems are also ideally suited for industrial process heat applications and sea-water desalination.

30|$|One type {{of linear}} <b>concentrating</b> <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> is the {{parabolic}} trough collector (PTC) which is useful {{in a wide range}} of applications where the working temperatures are 50 – 400  °C [1]. In essence, a PTC consists of a parabolic trough mirror or reflector and a solar receiver tube in the focal line of the reflector. Sunlight falls on the reflector, which focuses it onto the solar receiver tube. The outer surface of the solar receiver tube is coated with solar selective materials to absorb that concentrated sunlight and also any sunlight that falls directly on the tube itself. All the collected radiation is then converted into thermal energy [2, 3]. One important task is the development of a solar selective absorber to achieve high solar absorptance (α) or low reflectance (R) over the whole range of the solar spectrum (300 – 2500  nm) and low emittance (ε) of long wavelength infrared (IR) radiation at 2.5 – 20  μm [4, 5, 6].|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Concentrating</b> <b>solar</b> <b>collectors</b> {{direct the}} {{sunlight}} towards a focus point or focus line. Relevant parameters are the fidelity of the concentrator {{with respect to}} its ideal parabolic shape, its stiffness under wind and gravitational loads, the angular accuracy of the tracking and the solar weighted specular reflectance of the reflector. Additional aspects refer to the long term durability and ease of cleaning of the reflector surface. Solar concentrators require lower geometrical precision than astronomic apparatus. Therefore, more cost effective designs are possible by using up the overall acceptable error budget to a level that collection efficiency of the reflected sun rays is still very efficient.

To maintain a mean focus deviation of the reflected rays from the focal line of less than 6 mm under operating conditions, a specific weight of 14 kg/m 2 could be reached. As structural elements of the collector are located between mirror and absorber, ray tracing analysis is performed for one selected conceptual design to estimate the effects of blocking and shading on the optical performance.

The study aims to show the feasibility of a <b>concentrating</b> <b>solar</b> <b>collector,</b> which is coupled with a HP. Particular emphasis is placed on the capillary and boiling limits in capillary porous structures, with different mesh numbers and wick thicknesses. A mathematical model of a cylindrical HP is applied to study its behaviour when it is exposed to higher heat input at the evaporator. The steady state analytical model includes two-dimensional heat conduction in the HP wall, the liquid flow in the wick and vapour hydrodynamics. A sensitivity analysis was conducted by considering different design criteria and working conditions. Different wicks (mesh 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 and, 300), different porosities (0. 5, 0. 6, 0. 7, 0. 8, and 0. 9) with different wick thicknesses (0. 25, 0. 5, 1, 1. 5, and 2 mm) are analysed with water as a working fluid.

40|$|Two {{designs for}} an {{integrated}} photoelectrolysis system {{that uses a}} 10 × <b>concentrating</b> <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> have been investigated in detail. The system performance was evaluated using a multi-physics model that accounted for {{the properties of the}} tandem photoabsorbers, mass transport, and the electrocatalytic performance of the oxygen-evolution and hydrogen-evolution reactions (OER and HER, respectively). The solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiencies and the ohmic losses associated with proton transport in the solution electrolyte and through the membrane of the photoelectrolysis system were evaluated systematically {{as a function of the}} cell dimensions, the operating temperatures, the bandgap combinations of the tandem cell, and the performance of both the photoabsorbers and electrocatalysts. Relative to designs of optimized systems that would operate without a solar concentrator, the optimized 10 × solar concentrator designs possessed larger ohmic losses and exhibited less uniformity in the distribution of the current density along the width of the photoelectrode. To minimize resistive losses while maximizing the solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency, η_(STH), both of the designs, a two-dimensional “trough” design and a three-dimensional “bubble wrap” design, required that the electrode width or diameter, respectively, was no larger than a few millimeters. As the size of the electrodes increased beyond this limiting dimension, the η_(STH) became more sensitive to the performance of the photoabsorbers and catalysts. At a fixed electrode dimension, increases in the operating temperature reduced the efficiency of cells with smaller electrodes, due to degradation in the performance of the photoabsorber with increasing temperature. In contrast, cells with larger electrode dimensions showed increases in efficiency as the temperature increased, due to increases in the rates of electrocatalysis and due to enhanced mass transport. The simulations indicted that cells that contained 10 % photoabsorber area, and minimal amounts of Nafion or other permselective membranes (i. e. areal coverages and volumetric fractions of only a few percent of the cell), with the remaining area comprised of a suitable, low-cost inert, non porous material (flexible polymers, inert inorganic materials, etc.) should be able to produce high values of η_(STH), with η_(STH) = 29. 8 % for an optimized design with a bandgap combination of 1. 6 eV/ 0. 9 eV in a tandem photoabsorber system at 350 K...|$|E

40|$|The {{challenge}} of improving component quality and reducing cost has focused {{the attention of}} the solar thermal power industry on reliable component characterization methods. Since the reflector {{plays a key role in}} the energy conversion chain, the analysis of its reflectance properties has become a lively discussed issue in recent years. State of the art measurement instruments for specular reflectance do not give satisfying results, because they do not resolve sufficiently the near specular scatter of possible low cost mirror material candidates. The measurement of the BRDF offers a better solution than the traditional approach of placing a detector in the specular reflected beam path. However, due to the requirement of high angular resolution in the range of 1 mrad (0. 057 °) or better and the {{challenge of}} measuring high dynamic differences between the specular peak and the scatter signal, typical commercial scanning goniophotometers capable of this are rare. These instruments also face the disadvantages of impractically long acquisition times and, to reach the high angular resolution, occupy a large space (several meters side length). We have taken on the appealing idea of a parallel imaging goniophotometer and designed a prototype based on this principle. A mirrored ellipsoid is used to redirect the reflected light coming from a sample towards a camera with a fisheye lens. This way the complete light distribution is captured simultaneously. A key feature allows the distinction of the high intensity specular peak and the low intensity scatter. In this article we explain the prototype design and demonstrate its functionality based on comparison measurements done with a commercial scanning goniophotometer. We identify limitations related in part to the concept and in part to the specific prototype and suggest improvements. Finally we conclude that the concept is well suitable for the analysis of near specular scatter of mirror materials, although less adequate for the analysis of rough surfaces that require a full 180 ° view angle. Results obtained with this instrument are useful to evaluate the performance of a reflector material for a specific <b>concentrating</b> <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> design and also serve in other applications that require near specular scatter analysis like degradation and soiling research...|$|E
40|$|Despite water being {{apparently}} abundant, {{up to half}} of the world’s {{population is}} faced with water crises which is growing at an alarming rate most especially in developing countries such as African countries where both physical and economic water scarcities prevail. Thus with the abundant salty water and solar intensity in the regions or seasons when water is mostly scarce, solar powered desalination presents an attractive and promising solution towards availability of clean water. A unique and simple solar desalination system has been developed. The system which based on humidification/dehumidification process is a low cost solution and very competitive with conventional desalination systems. It can be used to provide clean water to the over one billion population who have no access or have water shortages which threaten their health and economies. The developed solar desalination system consists of a purposely designed <b>concentrating</b> <b>solar</b> <b>collector</b> and the desalination core which consist of the humidification and dehumidification chambers. The novel concentrating v-trough solar collector which has its focal point {{at the bottom of the}} concentrator provides enough thermal energy required to heat up seawater which is then pumped and sprayed to humidify the incoming air in the humidification chamber. The humidified air enters the dehumidification chamber and is cooled by the incoming cold seawater. The moisture is condensed out and the pure water is accumulated at the base of the chamber, and the dehumidified air is discharged to the outside. The key point is the psychrometric energy re-use, most of the energy is from the condensing of the moisture in the carrier gas. Both theoretical analysis and experimental tests were carried out and good water output up to 20 kg/h and COP around 3 was obtained. This would require 8 m 2 of the newly designed v-trough collector operating at 100 °C at 1000 W/m 2 solar intensity. And economic and environmental analysis showed that the solar powered desalination system can achieve a 6 year payback period when compared with when driven by electricity and also a saving of up to 4730 kgCO 2 per year. The system can be manufactured from inexpensive plastics rather than exotic and expensive metals. It can easily be sized and scaled to location’s needs, can be operated in diverse geographies unattended on a continuous basis and require minimal maintenance.

Two tests of the full system with direct illumination of the heat storage by the sun have been conducted. Temperature measurements were done by thermocouples in the heat storage and on the secondary reflector, and a thermal camera was used to monitor the temperature of the top plate of the heat storage.

The reflective film was {{as a result of these}} tests changed to reflective aluminium tiles for a better performance. Additional tests with a thin absorber plate of carbon steel were then conducted, since the sun was now too low on the sky to allow a complete test.

We use a Sun and Aureole Measurement system (SAM) combined with AERONET sun photometer measurements to determine the circumsolar radiation, and compare the results to a newly developed 2 -channel pyrheliometer instrument BPI-CSR 460...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{controlling}} <b>concentrated</b> <b>solar</b> <b>collectors</b> where the objective consists of making the outlet temperature of the collector tracking a desired reference. The performance of the novel approximate model based on fuzzy theory, which has been introduced by the authors in [1], is evaluated comparing to other methods in the literature. The proposed approximation is a low order state representation derived from the physical distributed model. It reproduces the temperature transfer dynamics through the collectors accurately and allows the simplification of the control design. Simulation results show interesting performance of the proposed controller...|$|R
40|$|<b>Concentrated</b> <b>solar</b> <b>collectors</b> {{including}} <b>solar</b> simulators {{have been}} studied to <b>concentrate</b> <b>solar</b> radiation to flux levels capable of reaching temperatures of 3000 K. Currently, there are no industrial scale solar reactors used for material processing and only small research units have been tried. Various laboratory scale solar reactor designs are reviewed including their operating temperature and heat transfer efficiency. Solar reactor designs can be classed into directly or indirectly irradiated and single or double cavity construction. Thermal efficiencies of up to 40 % have been achieved in experimental units while operating at 1500 K. Problems are encountered {{that relate to the}} transfer of high heat flux. Hybrid reactor system should be considered in the future to overcome some of the practical issues associated with solar thermal reactors...|$|R
