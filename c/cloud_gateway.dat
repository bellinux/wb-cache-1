40|$|Abstract. In a virtualized environment, contextualization is {{the process}} of {{configuring}} a VM instance for the needs of various deployment use cases. Contextualization in CernVM can be done by passing a handwritten context to the user data field of cloud APIs, when running CernVM on the cloud, or by using CernVM web interface when running the VM locally. CernVM Online is a publicly accessible web interface that unifies these two procedures.

40|$|Abstract- A <b>cloud</b> storage <b>gateway</b> is {{a network}} {{appliance}} or server which resides at the customer premises. It can integrate and translate different cloud storage APIs and increase data security. A variety of designs of <b>cloud</b> storage <b>gateway</b> have been proposed. However, existing designs cannot help users to access data stored on the cloud when cloud storage cannot be reached due to maintenance, interruptions or other failures. In this paper, {{we present a}} design of <b>cloud</b> storage <b>gateway</b> based on data dispersal. In the <b>cloud</b> storage <b>gateway</b> of our design, data is divided into redundant data blocks and parity blocks, and these blocks are stored into different cloud storage respectively. When a portion of cloud storage cannot be accessed, the new designed <b>cloud</b> storage <b>gateway</b> still able to access the required data by restoring data from other available cloud storage. Further, if an acceptable number of data blocks are lost or erroneous, the <b>cloud</b> storage <b>gateway</b> of our design can also restore the original data.

The key management of those clients for encrypting data to satisfy Confidentiality must furthermore support join-/leave-operations within the client set.
