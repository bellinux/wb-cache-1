5|$|According to the story, {{unaware of}} the nature of the gift, Norton saved the <b>cigar,</b> keeping it on display in his college's museum. Years later, when the school was {{shutting}} its doors for good, the alumni thought it would be a fitting gesture to smoke the <b>cigar</b> at the college's annual reunion. The honor was given to Winstead Norton, Horace's grandson. During the sober speech he was presenting, Winstead lit the <b>cigar,</b> and after two puffs, it exploded. A 1952 news report contradicts one detail, holding that the explosion ultimately occurred at a family reunion rather than the alumni affair noted.|$|E
5|$|An {{exploding}} <b>cigar</b> is {{a variety}} of <b>cigar</b> that explodes shortly after being lit. Such cigars are normally packed with a minute chemical explosive charge near the lighting end or with a non-chemical device that ruptures the <b>cigar</b> when exposed to heat. The customary intended purpose of exploding cigars is {{as a form of}} hostile practical joke, rather than to cause lasting physical harm to the butt of the joke. Nevertheless, the high risk of unintended injuries from their use caused a decline in their manufacture and sale.|$|E
5000|$|Little <b>cigars</b> (sometimes called small <b>cigars</b> or miniatures in the UK) differ {{greatly from}} regular <b>cigars.</b> They weigh less than <b>cigars</b> and cigarillos, but, more importantly, they {{resemble}} cigarettes in size, shape, packaging, and filters. Sales of little <b>cigars</b> quadrupled in the U.S. from 1971 to 1973 {{in response to}} the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act, which banned the broadcast of cigarette advertisements and required stronger health warnings on cigarette packs. <b>Cigars</b> were exempt from the ban, and perhaps more importantly, were taxed at a far lower rate. Little <b>cigars</b> are sometimes called [...] "cigarettes in disguise", and unsuccessful {{attempts have been made to}} reclassify them as cigarettes. In the United States, sales of little <b>cigars</b> reached an all-time high in 2006, fueled in great part by favorable taxation.In some states, however, little <b>cigars</b> have successfully been taxed at the rate of cigarettes, such as Illinois, as well as multiple other states. This has caused yet another loophole, in which manufacturers classify their products as [...] "filtered cigars" [...] instead to avoid the higher tax rate. Yet, many continue to argue that there is in fact a distinction between little <b>cigars</b> and filtered <b>cigars.</b> Little <b>cigars</b> offer a similar draw and overall feel to cigarettes, but with aged and fermented tobaccos, while filtered <b>cigars</b> are said to be more closely related to traditional <b>cigars,</b> and are not meant to be inhaled.|$|R

Cuba produces both handmade and machine-made <b>cigars.</b> All boxes and labels are marked Hecho en Cuba (Spanish for made in Cuba). Machine-bunched <b>cigars</b> finished by hand add Hecho a mano, while fully handmade <b>cigars</b> say Totalmente a mano in script text, though not all Cuban <b>cigars</b> will include this statement. Because of the perceived status of Cuban <b>cigars,</b> counterfeits are somewhat commonplace.|$|R

5|$|Both prank and {{intentionally}} deadly exploding cigars {{have been}} featured in numerous works of fiction, spanning many forms of media including literature, film, comics books, cartoons and others. A well-known use of the exploding <b>cigar</b> in literature, for example, appears in Thomas Pynchon's 1973 novel, Gravity's Rainbow. In it, the character Etzel Ölsch symbolically betrays his death wish by eagerly smoking a <b>cigar</b> he knows {{to be of the}} prank explosive variety. Other book examples include Robert Coover's 1977 novel, The Public Burning, where a fictionalized Richard Nixon hands an exploding <b>cigar</b> to Uncle Sam, and Sherburne James' Death's Clenched Fist (1982), in which a Tammany Hall politico of the 1890s is murdered with an exploding <b>cigar.</b>|$|E
5|$|Film {{examples}} include Cecil B. DeMille's 1921 romance Fool's Paradise, wherein {{the main character}} is blinded by an exploding cigar; Laurel and Hardy's Great Guns (1941), which features a gag in which tobacco is replaced by gunpowder; the Elke Sommer vehicle, Deadlier Than the Male (1967), where a murder by exploding <b>cigar</b> is a key plot element; in The Beatles' 1968 animated feature film, Yellow Submarine, where an exploding <b>cigar</b> is used to rebuff a psychedelic boxing monster; the 1984 comedy Top Secret!, in which Omar Sharif's British secret agent character is pranked with an exploding <b>cigar</b> by a blindman; and in the 2005 film V for Vendetta, where the main antagonist's <b>cigar</b> is swapped with an exploding one during a comedy skit.|$|E

50|$|Not only cigarettes, {{but also}} <b>cigars</b> were {{produced}} {{which had a}} decorated ring chrysanthemum crest, with 25 to each small wooden box. The leaves were produced in Sumatra and Havana. The production of <b>cigars</b> started in 1939, while the exclusive <b>cigars</b> for Emperor Taisho started earlier in 1917. In 1945, 4,000 <b>cigars</b> were produced. This was peak production. Between 1945 and 1982, an average of 2,500 <b>cigars</b> were produced.|$|R

40|$|IntroductionConsiderable {{evidence}} exists that little <b>cigars</b> are popular among African American {{adolescents and young}} adults who smoke. However, few studies have been published on the use of this tobacco product by young blacks in the United States. This research investigated little-cigar use among students at a historically black university in the southeastern United States. MethodsAs a follow-up to a survey on tobacco use among freshmen that revealed unexpectedly high rates of little-cigar use, 3 focus groups were conducted with current or former smokers of little <b>cigars.</b> Topics included preferred brands of little <b>cigars,</b> preference for little <b>cigars</b> over cigarettes, social contexts for smoking little <b>cigars,</b> perceived health risks of smoking little <b>cigars</b> relative to smoking cigarettes, and thoughts about quitting. ResultsFocus group participants preferred little <b>cigars</b> to cigarettes for various reasons, among them taste, smell, a better "buzz," social purposes, status, and perceptions that smoking little <b>cigars</b> is less addictive and less harmful than smoking cigarettes. Opinions on health risks varied; some participants believed that health risks can be reduced by removing the inner liner of little <b>cigars.</b> ConclusionUse of little <b>cigars</b> should be addressed in tobacco research, use prevention, and use cessation efforts, targeting students at historically black colleges and perhaps other young African Americans. Results also suggest that clear distinctions should be made among cigarettes, little <b>cigars,</b> and <b>cigars,</b> and that tobacco use prevention and cessation programs should debunk myths that little <b>cigars</b> are a safe alternative to cigarettes. Study findings should be confirmed and elucidated through additional research...|$|R
5|$|Although far rarer {{than their}} prank cousins, {{exploding}} cigars {{used as a}} means to kill or attempt to kill targets in real life has been claimed, and is well represented as a fictional plot device. The most famous case concerning the intentionally deadly variety was an alleged plot by the CIA of the US in the 1960s to assassinate Fidel Castro. Notable real-life incidents involving the non-lethal ilk include an exploding <b>cigar</b> purportedly given by Ulysses S. Grant to an acquaintance and a dust-up between Turkish military officers and Ernest Hemingway after he pranked one of them with an exploding <b>cigar.</b>|$|E

5|$|However, {{the decline}} in the use and {{advertisement}} of the exploding <b>cigar</b> was neither complete, nor permanent, and they can be obtained worldwide. In the United States, makers include Don Osvaldo and Hawkins Joke Shop. However, their availability in the USA is limited, as some states, such as Massachusetts, have banned their sale entirely.|$|E
50|$|As of 1905, {{there were}} 80,000 cigar-making {{operations}} in the United States, most of them small, family-operated shops where <b>cigars</b> were rolled and sold immediately. While most <b>cigars</b> are now made by machine, some, {{as a matter of}} prestige and quality, are still rolled by hand---especially in Central America and Cuba, as well as in small chinchales in sizable cities in the United States. Boxes of hand-rolled <b>cigars</b> bear the phrase totalmente a mano (totally by hand) or hecho a mano (made by hand). These premium hand-rolled <b>cigars</b> are significantly different from the machine-made <b>cigars</b> sold in packs at drugstores or gas stations. Since the 1990s there has been severe contention between producers and aficionados of premium handmade <b>cigars</b> and cigarette manufacturing companies that create machine-made <b>cigars.</b>|$|R

5|$|Dudley was {{credited}} with discovering that a toxic component of tobacco smoke is carbon monoxide (which poisons the blood by interfering with oxygen's ability to bind to hemoglobin). Dudley rejected the popularly held opinion that cigarette smoke was harmful due to the adulteration of the tobacco, e. g. with opium. His experiments showed the toxic agent to be carbon monoxide, resulting alike from cigarette, pipe, or <b>cigar.</b>|$|E
