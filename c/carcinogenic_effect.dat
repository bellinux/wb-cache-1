Although Gyromitra esculenta has not been observed to cause cancer in humans, it is possible there is a carcinogenic risk for people who ingest these types of mushrooms. The toxins may be cumulative and even small amounts may have a <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>effect.</b> At least 11 different hydrazines have been isolated from Gyromitra esculenta, and it is not known if the potential carcinogens can be completely removed by parboiling.|$|E

Despite its common usage in extremely low concentrations to prevent gonorrhea and control nose bleeds, silver nitrate {{is still very}} much toxic and corrosive. Brief exposure will not produce any immediate side effects other than the purple, brown or black stains on the skin, but upon constant exposure to high concentrations, side effects will be noticeable, which include burns. Long-term exposure may cause eye damage. Silver nitrate is known to be a skin and eye irritant.

25|$|From {{a sample}} of 129 beluga adults from the Saint Lawrence River {{examined}} between 1983 and 1999, a total of 27% had suffered cancer. This is a higher percentage than that documented for other populations of this species and {{is much higher than}} for other cetaceans and for the majority of terrestrial mammals; in fact, the rate is only comparable to the levels found in humans and some domesticated animals. For example, the rate of intestinal cancer in the sample is much higher than for humans. This condition is thought to be directly related to environmental contamination, in this case by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and coincides with the high incidence of this disease in humans residing in the area. The prevalence of tumours suggests the contaminants identified in the animals that inhabit the estuary are having a direct <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>effect</b> or they are at least causing an immunological deterioration that is reducing the inhabitants' resistance to the disease.|$|E
2500|$|Genotoxicity {{involves}} {{inhibition of}} DNA repair and DNA methylation. [...] The <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>effect</b> of arsenic {{arises from the}} oxidative stress induced by arsenic. [...] Arsenic's high toxicity naturally {{led to the development}} of a variety of arsenic compounds as chemical weapons, e.g. dimethylarsenic chloride. Some were employed as chemical warfare agents, especially in World War I. [...] This threat led to many studies on antidotes and an expanded knowledge of the interaction of arsenic compounds with living organisms. [...] One result was the development of antidotes such as British anti-Lewisite. [...] Many such antidotes exploit the affinity of As(III) for thiolate ligands, which convert highly toxic organoarsenicals to less toxic derivatives. It is generally assumed that arsenates bind to cysteine residues in proteins.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY-To {{assess their}} <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>effects,</b> the ethylnitrosourea (ENU) precursors, ethylurea and sodium ni-trite, were {{administered}} to pregnant hamsters as a single in-tragastric dose on day 15 of gestation, or introduced into the cecum on day 14. Since sodium ascorbate (NaASC) inhibits the biosynthesis of nitrosamides, identical doses of the precur-sors were given concomitantly with NaASC. Progeny of moth-ers treated intragastrically developed significant incidences of neurogenic tumors of the peripheral nervous system, with a predominance in females. The concurrent administration of NaASC with ENU precursors prevented <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>effects</b> in the progeny, whereas the simultaneous inoculation of the pre-cursors into the cecum produced no <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>effects</b> in the offspring. -J Natl Cancer Inst 55 : 1389 - 1394, 1975.

[...] In 2011, the national Dr. Oz television show broadcast a program highlighting tests performed by an independent lab hired by the producers. Though the methodology was disputed (it did not distinguish between organic and inorganic arsenic) the tests showed levels of arsenic up to 36 ppb. [...] In response, FDA tested the worst brand from the Dr. Oz show and found much lower levels. Ongoing testing found 95% of the apple juice samples were below the level of concern. Later testing by Consumer Reports showed inorganic arsenic at levels slightly above 10 ppb, and the organization urged parents to reduce consumption. [...] In July 2013, on consideration of consumption by children, chronic exposure, and <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>effect,</b> the FDA established an [...] "action level" [...] of 10 ppb for apple juice, the same as the drinking water standard.|$|E

40|$|<b>Carcinogenic</b> <b>effects</b> of circadian disruption: an {{epigenetic}} viewpoint Abbas Salavaty* Circadian rhythms {{refer to}} the endogenous rhythms that are generated to synchronize physiology and behavior with 24 -h environmental cues. These rhythms are regulated by both external cues and molecular clock mechanisms in almost all cells. Disruption of circadian rhythms, which is called circadian disruption, affects many biological processes within the body and results in different long-term diseases, including cancer. Circadian regulatory pathways result in rhythmic epigenetic modifications {{and the formation of}} circadian epigenomes. Aberrant epigenetic modifications, such as hypermethylation, due to circadian disruption may be involved in the transformation of normal cells into cancer cells. Several studies have indicated an epigenetic basis for the <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>effects</b> of circadian disruption. In this review, I first discuss some of the circadian genes and regulatory proteins. Then, I summarize the current evidence related to the epigenetic modifications that result in circadian disruption. In addition, I explain the <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>effects</b> of circadian disruption and highlight its potential role in different human cancers using an epigenetic view-point.
