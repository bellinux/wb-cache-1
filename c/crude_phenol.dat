Examinations concerning the localization of PO in culture supernatants and various cellular fractions revealed strong association within particulate cell debris, especially outer membrane fractions containing residues of cell and cyst walls [Herter et al. 2011] and therefore comparably minor amounts were observed to be released into supernatants of enzyme preparations. With respect to the herein performed experiments using <b>crude</b> <b>phenol</b> oxidase initial attempts to purify the native enzyme contained within A. chroococcum crude extracts were not successful due to irreversible absorption of this enzyme {{to a wide range}} of columns and membranes under a variety of conditions. Therefore, instead of using mandatory purified enzyme preparation for comprehensive enzyme characterization studies, experiments were conducted with <b>crude</b> <b>phenol</b> oxidase aiming to provide an initial understanding of general characteristics of this particular PO.|$|E

Some volatile phenols have been determined in concentrations up to 5. 6 mg/i 3 in the air of various departments of the oil shale processing plants (2).

Based upon the pH optimum, thermal stability was also tested using NAc buffer at pH 5 in a temperature range from 25 - 55 °C (see Additional file 2). In the case of ABTS oxidation, crude PO showed highest activity when pre-incubated at 35 °C, with 118 % activity relative to that recovered with 2, 6 -DMP at the same temperature. Activity at temperatures above 50 °C (60 % residual activity) could not be monitored further due to substrate autoxidation.

Poit {{is widely}} known as "itamo real" and numerous therapeutical applications {{have been attributed}} to it. OBJETIVES: to evaluate the neurosedative effect of different fractions of extracts from P. tithymaloides leaves. METHODS: succesives extractions were made from smashed dry leaves, with the purpose of obtaining several fractions using toluene, chloroform and hydroalcohol solvents (1 : 1); the neurosedative activity was also evaluated with an exploratory behaviour model in mice as an indication of this effect and data were processed with Duncan´s statistical test, with a level of significance of p< 0. 05.

In addition, Rm 6963 {{lost the ability to}} grow in Luria-Bertani medium containing the hydrophobic compounds sodium deoxycholate or SDS and showed a decrease in survival in TY medium supplemented with high calcium concentrations. The mutant also had altered symbiotic properties. Rm 6963 formed nodules that fixed nitrogen but showed a delayed or even reduced ability to nodulate the primary root of alfalfa without showing changes in the position of nodule distribution profiles along the roots. Furthermore, 2 to 3 weeks after inoculation, plants nodulated by Rm 6963 were smaller than control plants inoculated with wild-type bacteria in correlation with a transient decrease in nitrogen fixation. In most experiments, the plants recovered later by expressing a full nitrogen-fixing phenotype and developing an abnormally high number of small nodules in lateral roots after 1 month. Rm 6963 was also deficient in the ability to compete for nodulation. In coinoculation experiments with equal bacterial numbers of both mutant and wild-type rhizobia, only the parent was recovered from the uppermost root nodules. A strain ratio of approximately 100 to 1 favoring the mutant was necessary to obtain an equal ratio (1 : 1) of nodule occupancy. These results show that alterations in Rm 6963 which include LPS changes lead to an altered symbiotic phenotype during the association with alfalfa that affects the timing of nodule emergence, the progress of nitrogen fixation, and the strain competitiveness for nodulation...|$|E
3000|$|Solubilisation {{experiments}} with particulate cell debris were only effective with anionic EDTA and the non-ionic agent Triton X- 100. EDTA {{was identified as}} being the most effectual agent in protein release, indicating that A. chroococcum SBUG 1484 <b>crude</b> <b>phenol</b> oxidase may act as a peripheral protein with electrostatic or ionic interactions to membrane lipids (occurring in A. chroococcum within the cytoplasmic membrane, outer membrane, and compounds of cyst walls) mediated by metal ions, particularly calcium. Through addition of EDTA to cyst or membrane fractions, lipopolysaccharides which are usually stabilised by divalent cations such as Ca 2 +, Mn 2 + and Mg 2 + become more fluid, resulting in permeabilization and subsequent release of proteins due {{to the formation of}} EDTA-metal complexes [Goldschmidt and Wyss 1966]. Furthermore, the addition of EDTA reduces the enzymatic inhibition typically caused by heavy metal ion stimulated oxidation of thiol-groups by molecular oxygen. A slight increase in enzyme activity and protein release could also be monitored when preparing membranes with Triton X- 100. This detergent shows high affinity to hydrophobic regions, especially phospholipid bilayer membranes whereby effective binding and solubilisation of phospholipids from cytoplasmic membrane portions of cell wall fragments are commonly described [Reisinger and Eichacker 2006]. Herein we found A. chroococcum crude PO to exist as a native active homotrimer (142 kDa), which is also active in monomeric and dimeric states. Accordingly, PO of Streptomyces psammoticus was found to act as a monomer with an apparent molecular weight of 45 kDa [Niladevi et al. 2008], whereby Streptomyces griseus PO showed comparable results to A. chroococcum SBUG 1484 with an active native homotrimer comprised of 38 kDa monomers [Endo et al. 2003]. Smaller prokaryotic phenol oxidases between 30 and 70 kDa are generally observed, whilst fungal laccases tend to exhibit higher molecular weights ranging from 70 kDa for P. cinnabarinus, Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus oryzae PO [Sigoillot et al. 2003] up to 100 kDa for monomeric structures. PO of A. chroococcum SBUG 1484 in cell-free extracts revealed a pH optimum of 4.5 when oxidizing the substrate ABTS. Together with a beneficial pre-incubation at 35 °C and 25 - 30 °C (2, 6 -DMP, pH 5.0) respectively, parallels can be drawn to phenol oxidases and laccase-like enzymes especially expressed by other soil bacteria known for establishment of dormant stages during their life-cycle [Durao et al. 2008]. Crude PO from strain SBUG 1484 was determined as not requiring exogenous copper sources for activation, as it has been described previously for pseudo laccases [Solano et al. 2001]. Copper has often been described in stimulating the oxidizing activity of prokaryotic phenol oxidases, for example CueO of E. coli [...]...|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} {{estimate}} the native ecological role of this prokaryotic enzyme, primary biochemical investigations were conducted {{in an attempt to}} explore substrate scope in comparison to fungal crude PO preparations of P. cinnabarinus SBUG-M 1044 and PPO (tyrosinase) of A. bisporus. A clear preference of A. chroococcum SBUG 1484 PO-containing crude extracts was determined towards ortho-dihydroxylated compounds followed by mono-methoxylated monophenols, and dimethoxylated compounds (except 2, 6 -DMP with the highest activity of all substrates tested). Diminished activity towards para-dihydroxylated compounds was somewhat surprising as POs are strictly differentiated from catecholases and tyrosinases due to an exclusive and pronounced oxidation of 1, 4 -dihydroxylated compounds [Xu 1996]. However crude PO preparations from P. cinnabarinus SBUG-M 1044 showed comparable results to those obtained for A. chroocoocum <b>crude</b> <b>phenol</b> oxidase preparations. According to [Solano et al. 2001], results in the case of para-dihydroxylated substances could be reasoned with low molar adsorption coefficients at visible regions and instability of the formed products, suggesting para-diphenols as non-appropriate substrates in spectrophotometric standard assays. Substrates belonging to seven different compound classes were equally tested in a 5 mM concentration (2 mM for syringaldazine), which in some instances may lead to substrate inhibition of the tested enzymes. The pronounced oxidative activity of A. chroococcum SBUG 1484 crude PO towards 2, 6 -DMP and ABTS, a feature shared with P. cinnabarinus SBUG-M 1044 preparations, clearly confirms laccase-type characteristics of the herein described Azotobacter phenol oxidase. Furthermore, the studied bacterial PO comprised in cell-free crude extracts exhibited no PPO activity towards oxidation of tyrosine and para-cresol, which was however clearly determined with A. bisporus PPO. Crude PO of A. chroococcum SBUG 1484 possesses 128 % relative activity towards 2, 6 -DMP when compared to ABTS [Niladevi et al. (2008)]. studied 2, 6 -DMP as the preferred substrate for S. psammoticus PO with 214 % activity relative to that with ABTS. Despite the similarity between A. chroococcum SBUG 1484 and P. cinnabarinus SBUG-M 1044 crude PO preparations in 2, 6 -DMP oxidation, the examined prokaryotic PO differentiates from fungal PO due to an inability to oxidize vanillin azine and the typical laccase substrate syringaldazine. Both of these substrates reveal methoxy-substituents with an azine bridge at the C 4 -carbon atom of the aromatic ring. Structurally similar compounds, with methyl-, methylen or hydroxy-groups at the C 4 -position did not reduce activity of A. chroococcum crude PO, whereas substrates containing an acid or aldehyde residue as the terminal group were not oxidized. A. chroococcum SBUG 1484 as well as P. cinnabarinus SBUG-M 1044 PO preparations revealed no activity towards meta-dihydroxylated compounds, which has also been observed in many other POs with resorcinol derived substrates [Palmieri et al. 1997]. In case of ortho-diphenols the herein examined crude POs can be distinctly distinguished from PPO activity on the basis of decreased ΔA values within an extended time-range in which highest initial rates were obtained. However, comparing activity of A. chroococcum SBUG 1484 crude PO towards catechol-derivatives with other tested compounds, a high affinity towards substituted catechols was estimated. Laccase activity towards both, ortho- and para-dihydroxylated compounds has also been previously reported [Xu 1996].|$|E
40|$|Analytical {{procedures}} {{have been developed}} for the quantitative analysis of <b>phenols</b> in <b>crude</b> oils and sedimentary rock pyrolysates and extracts. The procedures involve isolation of the phenolic components of the sedimentary organic matter by extraction with alkaline aqueous methanol, followed by the removal of carboxylic acids using a back extraction step. Co-extracted non-polar components are removed from the alkaline extract by liquid chromatography or by extracting it with hexane. The phenol isolates thus obtained were analysed by capillary GC, GC-MS and GC-FTIR. Recoveries of 70 - 95 % were measured for C(subscript) 0 -C(subscript) 3 alkylphenol compounds using these procedures. Crude oil samples (45) representing a range of locations, ages, depositional environments, maturities, source types, and biodegradation levels have been analysed for their phenol contents. A range of C(subscript) 0 -C(subscript) 5 alkylphenols (approximately 40) were identified in crude oils using co-chromatography on up to three different stationary phases and by comparison of their retention times, mass spectral and infrared spectral properties with reference compounds. Isopropylmethylphenols (six) and sec-butylmethylphenols (nine) were synthesised for use in the identification of these compounds. A range of C(subscript) 0 -C(subscript) 4 alkylphenols (24) were quantified using a dimethyl siloxane column (BP 1 or DB 1) and found to occur at concentrations ranging from 190 x 10 (subscript) 3 ng/g down to the limit of detection of 10 ng/g (ppb). The crude oil samples were classified into six groups based on their C(subscript) 0 -C(subscript) 5 alkylphenol compositions. Group 1 crude oils have at least one isomer class in which the relative proportions of the alkylphenol isomers reflect their relative thermodynamic stabilities. The vast majority of samples, however, do not contain relative proportions of ++phenols which reflect their stabilities, and these differences have been used to group the remaining crude oils. Group 2 crude oils contain predominantly alkylphenols derived from natural product precursors. This group has been further subdivided into Group 2 A in which samples have isopropylmethylphenol distributions dominated by carvacrol and thymol; and Group 2 B which is comprised of crude oils that contain high relative abundances of methylphenols which can be derived from tocopherols. Group 3 crude oils have C(subscript) 2 -C(subscript) 5 alkylphenol compositions dominated by ortho and para substituted phenols which are proposed to be formed from geosynthetic processes. Group 4 crude oils contain alkylphenol compositions in which the relative abundances of meta substituted compounds in six isomer classes are much greater than those expected from chemical equilibration. Group 5 comprises of samples which are biodegraded and as a consequence contain alkylphenols below the limit of detection. Group 6 crude oils contain very low concentrations of alkylphenols and comprises samples which are derived from source rocks that pre-date the widespread occurrence of land plants or contain negligible land plant input. Some alkylphenols in crude oil are structurally related to natural product precursors and therefore appear to be biomarkers. The monoterpenoid natural products carvacrol and thymol, or its rearrangement product 3 -isopropyl- 5 -methylphenol, which occur in high relative abundances in Group 2 A samples are such compounds. Because carvacrol and thymol occur widely in extant conifers and angiosperms, their presence in crude oils derived from source rocks deposited when these plant types were widespread suggests they also originate from these plants. A range of trimethylphenols and tetramethylphenols which occur in high relative abundances in Group 2 B samples, are also ++reaction products obtained from heating alpha-tocopherol with aluminium smectite. This, together with the reported widespread occurrence of tocopherols in plant photosynthetic tissue and in sedimentary rocks, leads to the conclusion that tocopherols are likely precursors to these petroleum methylphenols. The lignin components of terrestrial plants also appear to be important precursors to petroleum alkylphenols. Strong evidence for this is provided by the observation that crude oils derived from source rocks which contain negligible higher plant input contain very low concentrations of kylphenols (Group 6). In order to determine the likelihood of lignins as precursors of petroleum alkylphenols, the phenol contents of coals of lignitic through to bituminous rank were examined. The unbound phenolic components of the lignite samples were analysed by isolating the phenols from their dichloromethane extracts, and the bound phenolic components were analysed by pyrolysis GC-MS. At lignitic rank the unbound methoxyphenols allowed taxonomical classification of the samples and the bound hydroxyphenols bore structural similarities to lignin moieties. The bound C(subscript) 0 -C(subscript) 4 alkylphenol components of lignitic, subbituminous and bituminous coals in a sedimentary sequence were quantitatively analysed by isolating the phenols from their hydrous pyrolysates. In the coals of subbituminous and bituminous rank, the bound alkylphenol components could not easily be related to lignin precursors because molecular transformations of lignins are very severe at these ranks. The increases in the individual concentrations and relative proportions of alkylphenols with methyl and/or isopropyl substituent(s) in the ortho and para positions in the subbituminous coal pyrolysate were attributed to electrophilic methylation and isopropylation reactions occurring to lignin structures in ++coals during coalification. The dominance of ortho and para substituted methylphenols in coaly Group 3 A crude oils which were also observed in the hydrous pyrolysates of coals suggests that the altered lignin structures in coals may be precursors of some of these petroleum methylphenols. Methylation, isopropylation and sec-butylation, are proposed as geosynthetic processes to account for the alkylphenol compositions of <b>crude</b> oils with <b>phenol</b> distributions dominated by ortho and para alkyl-substituted compounds (Group 3). Many crude oils show high relative abundances of ortho and para substituted C(subscript) 1 -C(subscript) 5 alkylphenol isomers and some were also enriched in C(subscript) 3 -C(subscript) 5 alkylphenols compared to kerogen pyrolysates. Because the alkylphenol products obtained from the laboratory alkylation of cresols have distributions which closely resemble those in these crude oils, it is proposed that similar alkylation processes occur in source rocks. Alkylation ratios reflecting the degree of methylation, isopropylation and sec-butylation, which were based on the relative abundance of the dominant alkylation products compared to their likely precursor ortho cresol, indicate that high levels of methylation occurred in crude oils over a wide range of maturities. In contrast, high levels of isopropylation and sec-butylation were observed only in mature samples. Selective dissolution of <b>phenol</b> isomers in <b>crude</b> oils by water contact was discounted as an explanation for the observed phenol distributions based on the relative distribution coefficients of phenols between isooctane and water. The alkylphenol compositions of the remaining crude oils appear to be produced from alteration processes occurring in the subsurface; these include oxidation and biodegradation processes. Oxidation of alkylphenols is proposed to account for the alkylphenol compositions of ++Group 4 crude oils. Because ortho and para substituted alkylphenols are more susceptible to oxidation than their meta substituted counterparts, the selective removal of these compounds via an oxidation process is suggested as an explanation for the high relative abundances of meta substituted isomers observed in these crude oils. A natural product origin for these compounds appears unlikely {{due to the lack of}} known natural products which could give rise to meta substituted alkylphenols with isopropyl substituents, and the diverse range of organisms required to give rise to the meta substituted phenols with n-alkyl substituents observed in Group 4 samples. Crude oils from two Australian basins which have undergone various levels of biodegradation were analysed to assess biodegradation effects on petroleum alkylphenol compositions. Alkylphenols could not be detected in the moderately to severely biodegraded crude oils (Group 5) whereas related non-biodegraded samples contained relatively higher levels of alkylphenols. The very low levels of phenols in the biodegraded samples (< 10 ppb) suggests that phenols are depleted via processes that occur during biodegradation. Because water washing often co-occurs with biodegradation, the very low levels of alkylphenols in these samples may also be due in part to the removal of these polar components via water dissolution...|$|R
