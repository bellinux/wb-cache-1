The effort devoted to mixers has two immediate goals: to design a low-noise mixer and to develop a technique for the precise measurement of the parameters of a microwave mixer. In the past year we carried out studies of the properties of conventional Schottky diode mixers at low temperature, but concluded that a greater potential for improve-ment in performance could be expected from two other devices, because of a sharper nonlinearity in their I-V characteristic. These devices, which we are now studying, are the superconducting Schottky junction, and the n nn diode, a <b>cryogenic</b> <b>device</b> 1 related to the cryosar. This device, described in Progress Report No. 116 (page 53), operates at voltages intermediate between conventional Schottky barrier mixer diodes and the millivolt level of the superconducting Schottky devices.

Investigation is also in progress to determine whether these devices have useful low-noise properties. Studies are being made of bridge techniques for measuring the small-signal scat-tering parameters of mixers. The phase angles of the S-parameters are also being measured.

40|$|CCDs {{continue}} to be the detector of choice for high resolution and high performance space applications. One perceived drawback is their susceptibility to radiation damage, in particular the formation of trap sites leading to a decrease in charge transfer efficiency. To that end, ESA has started a programme to investigate a new generation of devices based upon p-channel technology. The expectation is that once mature, p-channel devices may offer a significant increase in tolerance to proton radiation over traditional n-type buried channel CCDs. Early studies of e 2 v devices to assess the radiation hardness of p-channel devices were limited by the quality of devices available, however more recently, good quality p-channel CCD 204 s have been manufactured and studied. A more detailed evaluation of p-channel CCDs is now underway to realise the full potential of the technology for use in future high radiation environment space missions. A key aspect is the development of a cryogenic test rig that will allow {{for the first time a}} direct comparison of the radiation damage effects when the irradiation is performed both traditionally unbiased at room temperature and cryogenically with the device operational. Subsequent characterisations will also be performed on the <b>cryogenic</b> <b>device</b> after periods of storage at room temperature to investigate the potential annealing effects upon the lattice damage.
