50|$|Although PRAM {{has not yet}} {{reached the}} commercialization stage for {{consumer}} electronic devices, nearly all prototype devices make use of a <b>chalcogenide</b> <b>alloy</b> of germanium, antimony and tellurium (GeSbTe) called GST. The stoichiometry or Ge:Sb:Te element ratio is 2:2:5. When GST is heated to a high temperature (over 600 °C), its chalcogenide crystallinity is lost. Once cooled, it is frozen into an amorphous glass-like state and its electrical resistance is high. By heating the chalcogenide to a temperature above its crystallization point, but below the melting point, it will transform into a crystalline state with a much lower resistance. The time to complete this phase transition is temperature-dependent. Cooler portions of the chalcogenide take longer to crystallize, and overheated portions may be remelted. A crystallization time scale {{on the order of}} 100 ns is commonly used. This is longer than conventional volatile memory devices like modern DRAM, which have a switching time on the order of two nanoseconds. However, a January 2006 Samsung Electronics patent application indicates PRAM may achieve switching times as fast as five nanoseconds.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this PhD was {{the development of a}} suspension-based fabrication technique for CuIn(S,Se) 2 (CIS) and Cu(In,Ga) (S,Se) 2 (CIGS) chalcogenide semiconductor light absorber layers for solar cell applications via printing of a nanopowder precursor suspension followed by annealing/selenization. To reach the main objectives of this research, a systematic study was conducted to provide an in-depth understanding of the material science aspects of chalcogenide semiconductor processing. A new synthesis route was developed for high purity <b>chalcogenide</b> <b>alloy</b> nanopowder precursors for printing CuIn(S,Se) 2 (CIS) and Cu(In,Ga) (S,Se) 2 (CIGS) absorber layers with adjustable composition based on a sequence of dry mechanical alloying and wet ball milling in a sulfur doped-amine solution. The particle size distribution of the mechanically synthesized <b>chalcogenide</b> <b>alloy</b> nanopowders could be optimized by controlling the ball milling process parameters, such as milling speed and milling time. Suspension inks were prepared from mechanically synthesized <b>chalcogenide</b> <b>alloy</b> nanopowders, via solvent exchange and re-dispersing of <b>chalcogenide</b> <b>alloy</b> nanopowders in environmentally friendly solvents suitable for coating. Nanopowder suspension inks were coated on Mo-sputtered glass substrates via doctor blade coating followed by a drying process for the formation of 1 - 2 μm thin crack-free and organic phase free nanopowder precursor coatings. In order to transform the nanopowder precursor coatings into a 1 - 2 μm thin large crystalline CuInSe 2 and CIGSe semiconductor layer, annealing and heat treatments in controlled selenium vapor (selenization) were performed. A prototype infrared heating furnace for rapid thermal processing (RTP) in controlled selenium vapor (selenization) was designed and built. The effect of the chalcogenide nanopowder precursor composition and selenization conditions on the grain growth and densification of CISe and CIGSe semiconductor phases was investigated. <b>Chalcogenide</b> <b>alloy</b> nanopowder precursors with sub-stoichiometric selenium and sulfur contents (CuInSe 0. 5 and CuIn 0. 7 Ga 0. 3 S 0. 5) were found to be suitable precursors for the formation of large grain CuInSe 2 and CIGSe semiconductor phases during selenization. CISe and CIGSe semiconductor absorber layers were fabricated by inert gas annealing and selenization of printed CuInSe 0. 5 and CuIn 0. 7 Ga 0. 3 S 0. 5 nanopowder precursor coatings. The physical and optoelectronic properties of the CuInSe 2 and CIGSe semiconductor absorber layers were investigated by several characterization techniques. Thin film solar cell devices with standard stack structure of Glass/Mo/CIGSe/CdS/ZnO/AZO based on the printed CuInSe 2 and CIGSe semiconductor absorber layers showed efficiencies of 5. 4 % and 6 %.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 08 In recent years, copper sulfide nanocrystals (NCs) {{have emerged}} as {{promising}} candidates for new photothermal agents due to their strong near-infrared (NIR) light absorption, high photostability, low toxicity, and suitable size for photothermal therapy. 1, 2 However, the low photothermal conversion efficiency of copper sulfide NCs in the tissue transparency window from 650 to 900 nm hinders further development of copper sulfide as an effective photothermal agent. 3, 4 Therefore, it is still necessary to improve the photothermal conversion efficiency near 800 nm for these materials to be used effectively in photothermal therapy. 4 As a result, other kinds of copper chalcogenide NCs, such as copper selenide, copper telluride, and their alloys have been recently proposed. 5, 6, 7 By changing the mix of chalcogen substituents in the NC, the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) position can be tuned to more closely match the tissue transparency window, leading to a higher photothermal conversion efficiency near the excitation wavelength. 8 Copper selenide-sulfide and copper telluride-sulfide alloy NCs are especially interesting candidate materials for photothermal agents, as they should have lower cytotoxicity than pure copper selenide and copper telluride NCs due to their reduced selenium and tellurium content. However, their potential use for photothermal therapy {{has not yet been}} evaluated in depth. Herein, the photothermal conversion efficiency of several copper <b>chalcogenide</b> <b>alloy</b> NCs were investigated to evaluate the potential use of each as a photothermal agent via a comparison with unalloyed copper sulfide NCs. By controlling the composition of the alloys, their localized surface plasmon resonance peaks could be tuned throughout the near-infrared region, potentially leading to materials with resonances more closely matched to ideal therapeutic windows. Moreover, {{it was found that the}} photothermal conversion efficiency increased relative to the copper sulfide NCs as the LSPR peaks were tuned more closely to the 808 nm laser wavelength used in this study – directly within the center of the tissue transparency window...|$|E
40|$|The Cu 2 Te <b>chalcogenide</b> <b>alloy</b> is doped with 2 at. % Ni to {{increase}} the charge carrier concentration and then is further doped with 3 at. % Se to reduce the thermal conductivity. The alloys processing is kept simple-vacuum arc melting only to make a dense alloy for characterization. This also results in retaining the as-solidified highly layered structure. The alloys are found to have two polymorphic forms: hexagonal and orthorhombic at room temperature with a superstructure. The fractured surface shows clearly the layered structure with similar to 300 nm thick platelet like features stacked together to form large defect free grains. The electrical conductivity increases to similar to 7 x 10 (3) S cm(- 1) due to Ni-doping compared to similar to 5 x 10 (3) S cm(- 1) for the undoped alloy at room temperature. This however decreases to similar to 2. 5 x 10 (3) S cm(- 1) due to double doping, i. e., Ni and Se. In both cases, the alloys exhibit a weak metallic behavior with the conductivity decreasing with increasing temperature. The Seebeck coefficient however increases with temperature and with double doping resulting in the highest Seebeck coefficient, which increases from 40 mu VK- 1 to 110 mu VK- 1 when the temperature varies from 300 K to 1000 K. The hole carrier concentration in the two alloys, Ni-doped and double doped, {{is found to be}} nearly identical, 7 x 10 (20) cm(- 3) and 8. 52 x 10 (20) cm(- 3), respectively, while the mobility of carriers decreased by 5 times from 283 cm(2) V- 1 s(- 1) to 52 cm(2) V- 1 s(- 1) due to double doping. These factors together with multiple scale phonon scattering resulted in the double doped alloy having the lowest thermal conductivity in the range of 1 - 2 Wm(- 1) K- 1 in the complete temperature range. The thermal conductivity reduction due to the layered structure and alloy scattering results in increasing the figure of merit zT steeply to 0. 65 at 950 K which at 1100 K can reach 1. 0.

40|$|Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 (GST) films, one of {{the most}} {{suitable}} <b>Chalcogenide</b> <b>alloys</b> for Phase change Random Access Memory applications are studied for changes in sheet resistance, optical transmission, morphology and surface science by annealing at various transition temperatures. The crystallization leads to an increase of grain size and roughness in the films and the resistance changes to three orders of magnitude. Optical studies on GST films show distinct changes during phase transitions and the optical parameters are calculated. An increase of Tauc parameters B- 1 / 2 indicates a reduction in disorder during phase transition. It is confirmed from XPS studies that Ge-Te, Sb-Te bonds are present in both amorphous and crystalline phases whereas Sb-Ge, Te-Te, Sb-Sb bonds are absent. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{carefully}} address {{the interplay between}} substitutional disorder and spin-orbit-coupling in IV-VI alloys, we propose a novel theoretical approach that integrates the reliability of plane-wave based density-functional theory beyond the local-density approximation with the Coherent Potential Approximation. By applying the proposed method to ternary <b>chalcogenide</b> <b>alloys,</b> we predict a substantial robustness of spectral features close to the Fermi energy against substitutional disorder. Supplementing our first-principles calculations with {{the analysis of the}} k · p model for rock-salt chalcogenides, we show that the disorder self-energy is vanishingly small close to the band gap, thus allowing for bulk Rashba-like spin splitting to be observed in ferroelectric alloys, such as PbS_xTe_ 1 -x, and protecting the band-character inversion related to the topological transition in the recently discovered Topological Crystalline Insulator Pb_ 1 -xSn_xTe.

40|$|The {{application}} of amorphous <b>chalcogenide</b> <b>alloys</b> as data-storage media relies {{on their ability}} to undergo an extremely fast (10 - 100 ns) crystallisation once heated at sufficiently high temperature. However, the peculiar features that make these materials so attractive for memory devices still lack a comprehensive microscopic understanding. By means of large scale molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the supercooled liquid of the prototypical compound GeTe shows a very high atomic mobility (D ∼ 10 ^(- 6) cm 2 /s) down to temperatures close to the glass transition temperatures. This behaviour leads to a breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation between the self- diffusion coefficient and the viscosity in the supercooled liquid. The results suggest that the fragility of the supercooled liquid is the key to understand the fast crystallisation process in this class of materials. Comment: 6 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
