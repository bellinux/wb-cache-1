5|$|These {{negotiations}} {{broke down}} in 2005, when neither side <b>could</b> <b>agree</b> on the research protocol and the research project was cancelled. More {{progress has been made}} on the environmental front. In 2005, the first U.S.-Vietnam workshop on remediation of dioxin was held.|$|E
5|$|Dougan succeeded Terry Neill – {{his future}} Northern Ireland manager – as {{chairman}} of the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) in 1970. He advocated the belief that players should control their own destiny and used his position as Chairman of the PFA to further players' rights. He oversaw the inaugural PFA awards in 1973–74, which included the PFA Players' Player of the Year, PFA Young Player of the Year, PFA Team of the Year, and PFA Merit Award. He pushed for freedom of contract for players, and in 1978 accepted a compromise deal that allowed players to switch clubs {{at the end of their}} contracts, providing that the player's new club and old club <b>could</b> <b>agree</b> on a transfer fee, with a tribunal agreeing on a fee in cases where clubs could not agree.|$|E
5|$|Marlborough had won his {{bridgehead}} {{over the}} Danube, and had put himself between the French and Vienna; yet {{the battle was}} followed by a curious, dragging anti-climax. The Duke was determined to lure the Elector into battle before Tallard arrived with reinforcements, but since the battle on the Schellenberg neither Allied commander <b>could</b> <b>agree</b> on their next move, resulting in a protracted siege of Rain. Due to the initial lack of heavy guns and ammunition (promised by the Empire but not delivered on time) the town did not fall until 16 July. Nevertheless, Marlborough promptly occupied Neuburg which, together with Donauwörth and Rain, provided the Allies with enough fortified bridges across the Danube and Lech rivers to manoeuvre with ease.|$|E

Each pair can be identified by the color beside their name. In the event the Head of Household couple <b>could</b> not <b>agree</b> on who to nominate {{they would have been}} nominated and the runner-up couple in the competition would become the new HoH.

5|$|Harvey {{returned}} to politics after the 1929 {{stock market crash}} {{and the beginning of}} the Great Depression. He decided to run for the presidency. He formed the Liberty Party and held their national convention at Monte Ne. It was the only presidential convention ever held in Arkansas. Harvey prepared with railroad excursion rates, media facilities, upgraded roads, and food concessions, anticipating 10,000 delegates. He tented the amphitheater, set up seating, and installed an amplifier system to reach the thousands to be seated outside. Delegates were only eligible to attend if they certified they had read and agreed with the principles of Harvey's newest book The Book, which dealt with the harmful effects of usury by the government. In the end only 786 delegates attended, and Harvey was the only candidate the delegates <b>could</b> <b>agree</b> on. They nominated Andrae Nordskog of Los Angeles for vice president. The Liberty Party ended up merging with the Jobless Party, and Harvey ran for president as an independent; however, he is usually incorrectly credited as being their candidate in that election. Regardless, Franklin Delano Roosevelt won the 1932 presidential election, and Harvey only drew 800 votes.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{response to}} the strike and riot became a political football between the Republican leadership of Indianapolis, and the Democratic leadership of the state. The refusal by the city police to battle the strikers was met with approval by Mayor of Indianapolis, Republican Samuel Shank. Shank informed Governor Samuel Ralston that the strike was growing beyond what he could control and insisted the Governor should take responsibility {{for dealing with the}} situation. Shank asked Ralston to call a special session of the Indiana General Assembly to end the strike through a compulsory arbitration law, but Ralston refused because he thought it unlikely that the General Assembly <b>could</b> <b>agree</b> to such legislation in a timely manner. Ralston believed Shank was undermining the police effort and told him to order the city police back into action, but Shank refused. Ralston then bypassed the mayor and requested that County Sheriff, Democrat Theodore Porttens, bring in county police to reestablish order.|$|E
25|$|The only {{responsibilities}} {{mandated by}} the legislation were coordination of civil defence and development of a regional plan, although the constituent TLAs <b>could</b> <b>agree</b> on additional responsibilities {{at the point of}} formation of each united council. For example, in a number of cases the united council took responsibility for the allocation of revenue from regional petrol taxes.|$|E

The tour was planned to consist of three One Day Internationals (ODIs) and two Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is).

25|$|Wilson in {{opposition}} showed political ingenuity in devising {{a position that}} {{both sides of the}} party <b>could</b> <b>agree</b> on, opposing the terms negotiated by Heath but not membership in principle. Labour's 1974 manifesto included a pledge to renegotiate terms for Britain's membership and then hold a referendum on whether to stay in the EC on the new terms. This was a constitutional procedure without precedent in British history.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Campbell {{combined}} the Enlightenment approach to unity with the Reformed and Puritan traditions of restoration. The Enlightenment affected the Campbell movement in two ways. First, it provided {{the idea that}} Christian unity could be achieved by finding a set of essentials that all reasonable people <b>could</b> <b>agree</b> on. The second was {{the concept of a}} rational faith that was formulated and defended {{on the basis of a}} set of facts derived from the Bible.|$|E
25|$|The first Soviets {{to arrive}} at Cold Bay {{were members of the}} Soviet Purchasing Commission, who disembarked at the base on 23 March 1945. Maxwell {{believed}} that a great deal of classroom training would be necessary before the Soviet personnel began to train at sea, but the Soviet officers disagreed, preferring a greater emphasis on training at sea. They worked for a week on a training program that both sides <b>could</b> <b>agree</b> on, and achieved a successful compromise before the first trainees arrived.|$|E

25|$|The {{conclave}} {{began in}} the Vatican on 21 April, Easter Sunday. At the opening ceremonies, out of sixty living cardinals thirty-nine were in attendance. Three more arrived later, in time to cast a vote: Andreas of Austria, Ludovico Madruzzo of Trent, and Guido Luca Ferrero of Vercelli. Two factions quickly formed. The first was led by Cardinal Ferdinando de' Medici and the second by Luigi d'Este (grandson of King Louis XII of France). They were willing to combine to make a pope, but it depended on whether they <b>could</b> <b>agree</b> on a common candidate.|$|E
25|$|In his {{autobiography}} A Time to Heal, Ford wrote about a meeting {{he had with}} Nixon’s Chief of Staff, Alexander Haig. Haig was explaining what he and Nixon’s staff thought were Nixon’s only options. He could try to ride out the impeachment and fight against conviction in the Senate all the way, or he could resign. His options for resigning were to delay his resignation until further along in the impeachment process, to try and settle for a censure vote in Congress, or to pardon himself and then resign. Haig told Ford that some of Nixon’s staff suggested that Nixon <b>could</b> <b>agree</b> to resign in return for an agreement that Ford would pardon him.|$|E
25|$|With {{support from}} both the House of Representatives and the Senate, the fate of STS-135 {{ultimately}} depended on whether lawmakers <b>could</b> <b>agree</b> to fund converting the mission from launch-on-need to an actual flight. On 15 July 2010, a Senate committee passed the 2010 NASA reauthorization bill, authored by Senator Bill Nelson, to direct NASA to fly an extra space shuttle mission (STS-135) pending a review of safety concerns. The bill still needed {{the approval of the}} full Senate. A draft NASA reauthorization bill considered by the House Science & Technology Committee did not provide for an extra shuttle mission. On 22 July 2010, during a meeting of the House Science Committee, U.S. Rep. Suzanne Kosmas successfully amended the House version of the bill to add an additional shuttle mission to the manifest.|$|E

25|$|By the 17th Century, the Medieval teleological view {{came under}} intense {{criticism}} from some quarters. Thomas Hobbes instead founded a contractualist theory of legal positivism on what all men <b>could</b> <b>agree</b> upon: what they sought (happiness) {{was subject to}} contention, but a broad consensus could form around what they feared (violent death {{at the hands of}} another). The natural law was how a rational human being, seeking to survive and prosper, would act. Natural law, therefore, was discovered by considering humankind's natural rights, whereas previously it could be said that natural rights were discovered by considering the natural law. In Hobbes' opinion, the only way natural law could prevail was for men to submit to the commands of the sovereign. Because the ultimate source of law now comes from the sovereign, and the sovereign's decisions need not be grounded in morality, legal positivism is born. Jeremy Bentham's modifications on legal positivism further developed the theory.|$|E
25|$|A {{short time}} after {{entering}} the Columbia River and trading with the natives, ship and crew sailed to China {{to sell the}} pelts before returning to Boston in July 1793. Gray's entering of the Columbia was later used, during the Oregon boundary dispute, to support the American claim to the Oregon Country, against the claim of Britain. The American and British diplomats raised many points in addition to Gray's voyage to support their cases. Neither side <b>could</b> <b>agree</b> that the other had established a clear and exclusive right of sovereignty. The British raised several points questioning whether Gray's voyage up the Columbia River had any value in establishing sovereignty. The Americans raised counter-points. No agreement was reached on this and many other points about the right to the Oregon Country. In the end the dispute was resolved by compromise in the Oregon Treaty of 1846. Upon Gray’s return, though, little was thought of his discovery. He did not publish it, and the long-term consequences to which it contributed were unforeseen.|$|E
25|$|David O. Stewart, in his {{biography}} of Burr, American Emperor, {{notes that the}} reports of Hamilton's intentionally missing Burr with his shot began {{to be published in}} newspaper reports in papers friendly to Hamilton only in the days after his death. But Ron Chernow, in {{his biography}}, Alexander Hamilton, states Hamilton told numerous friends well before the duel of his intention to avoid firing at Burr. Additionally, Hamilton wrote a number of letters, including a Statement on Impending Duel With Aaron Burr and his last missives to his wife dated before the duel, that also attest to this intention. The two shots, witnesses reported, followed one another in close succession, and none of those witnesses <b>could</b> <b>agree</b> as to who fired first. Prior to the duel proper, Hamilton took {{a good deal of time}} getting used to the feel and weight of the pistol (which had been used in the duel at the same Weehawken site in which his 19-year-old son had been killed), as well as putting on his eyeglasses in order to see his opponent more clearly. The seconds placed Hamilton so that Burr would have the rising sun behind him, and during the brief duel, one witness reported, Hamilton seemed to be hindered by this placement as the sun was in his eyes.|$|E
