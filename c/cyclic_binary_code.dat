30|$|A blind {{recognition}} {{method for}} <b>binary</b> <b>cyclic</b> <b>codes</b> for non-cooperative communications and ACM in soft-decision situations is proposed. The code length and synchronization positions are estimated by checking the minimal parity-check matrices. After that, the whole check matrix and generator polynomial are reconstructed by searching which minimal polynomials are factors of the generator polynomial. The recognition method proposed {{in this paper}} {{is based on an}} earlier published RIDERS algorithm with some significant improvements. By calculating the probability that a minimal polynomial is a factor of the received codewords rather than checking whether an element in the extension field is a root of the codewords, we develop the RIDERS algorithm to soft-decision situations. To calculate the probability that a minimal polynomial is a factor of a received codeword, we adopt some algorithms and ideas introduced in soft-decision-based decoding methods and blind-frame-synchronization approaches for RS and BCH codes in the literatures. Although we have always a loss of performance when these algorithms are applied in cyclic codes while they are particularly well suited for LDPC codes, the algorithm proposed in this paper still has a previously better recognition performance for <b>binary</b> <b>cyclic</b> <b>codes</b> in a soft-decision situation than that in a hard-decision situation. And by the reliability-based adaptive processing, we reduce the influences of the most unreliability decision bits on the calculation of the syndromes, though the parity-check matrices of <b>binary</b> <b>cyclic</b> <b>codes</b> are not sparse. Moreover, the application field of the recognition method is extended to general <b>binary</b> <b>cyclic</b> <b>codes</b> in this paper, including shortened codes. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first publication in literature, which introduces an approach for complete-blind recognition of <b>binary</b> <b>cyclic</b> <b>codes</b> in soft-decision situations. Simulations show that our proposed blind recognition algorithm yields obviously better performance than that of the previous ones.|$|R
