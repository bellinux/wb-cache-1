25|$|Several {{aspects of}} {{multiplayer}} can be customised, {{such as the}} weapons, the number of points needed to win, the number of minutes {{until the end of}} the game, as well as the music that plays along with the level. There is also a variety of different characters the player can choose to play as, each with their own individual statistics. Some characters are from the Story mode, while there are other more humorous ones such as a dinosaur and an Elvis impersonator. Up to ten computer-controlled bots can be used. Their appearance, difficulty, and team can be customised. The bots <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>some</b> acrobatic moves that the player cannot do such as rolls and somersaults.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said {{he thought}} the episode was an improvement over the pilot episode, which he also enjoyed. Sepinwall said the episode seemed to distance the Leslie character from Michael Scott, Steve Carell's character on The Office, and gave more for the supporting cast to do; he particularly praised Schneider and Ansari. Matt Fowler of IGN said Amy Poehler [...] "remains frighteningly unflappable" [...] and said he enjoyed how disastrous the town hall meeting turned out to be, but said supporting characters like Mark and Ron [...] "need to be fleshed out a bit more and made... well, funnier." [...] Josh McAuliffe of The Times-Tribune said [...] "Canvassing" [...] was funnier than the pilot episode, but still lacked big laughs and [...] "I think the writers <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>some</b> interesting things with the whole playground plot, among them introducing us to some of Pawnee's more colorful denizens." ...|$|E
500|$|From the West, Vivekananda revived {{his work}} in India. He {{regularly}} corresponded with his followers and brother monks, offering advice and financial support. His letters from this period reflect his campaign of social service, and were strongly worded. He wrote to Akhandananda, [...] "Go from door to door amongst the poor and lower classes {{of the town of}} Khetri and teach them religion. Also, let them have oral lessons on geography and such other subjects. No good will come of sitting idle and having princely dishes, and saying [...] "Ramakrishna, O Lord!"â€”unless you <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>some</b> good to the poor". In 1895, Vivekananda founded the periodical Brahmavadin to teach the Vedanta. Later, Vivekananda's translation of the first six chapters of The Imitation of Christ was published in Brahmavadin in 1889. Vivekananda left for India on 16 December 1896 from England with his disciples Captain and Mrs. Sevier and J.J. Goodwin. On the way they visited France and Italy, and set sail for India from Naples on 30 December 1896. He was later followed to India by Sister Nivedita, who devoted {{the rest of her life}} to the education of Indian women and India's independence.|$|E

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2004, the Rockets {{acquired}} Tracy McGrady from the Orlando Magic in a seven-player trade that also sent Steve Francis and Cuttino Mobley to Orlando. Although Yao said that Francis and Mobley had [...] "helped [...] in every way [...] first two seasons", he added, [...] "I'm excited about playing with Tracy McGrady. He <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>some</b> amazing things." [...] After the trade, {{it was predicted that}} the Rockets would be title contenders. Both McGrady and Yao were voted to start in the 2005 NBA All-Star Game, and Yao broke the record previously held by Michael Jordan for most All-Star votes, with 2,558,278 total votes. The Rockets won 51games and finished fifth in the West, and made the playoffs for the second consecutive year, where they faced the Dallas Mavericks. The Rockets won the first two games in Dallas, and Yao made 13 of 14shots in the second game, the best shooting performance in the playoffs in Rockets history. However the Rockets lost four of their last five games and lost Game7 by 40points, the largest Game7 deficit in NBA history. Yao's final averages for the series were 21.4 points on 65% shooting and 7.7 rebounds.|$|E
2500|$|In episode 28 of the show's tenth series, the {{character}} returns to Holby City Hospital, and is disappointed to discover her late husband's charity is in decline. Asher has {{commented on the}} storyline: [...] "She's horrified when {{a young man with}} Asperger's syndrome can't have a routine operation because they don't have the necessary equipment. Lady Byrne then discovers that the boss of Charles' charity has been investing cash instead of putting it to good use." [...] The hospital's Chief Executive Officer, Jayne Grayson, convinces her to take over as Executive Chairman of the charity. [...] "Jayne sees that she has the strength to run the show," [...] Asher explained. [...] "Lady Byrne is reluctant at first, but realises that she <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>some</b> good and keep the family name going - and she does a rather excellent job of it." [...] Asher was able to contribute to the storyline in the planning stages, due to her real-world experience with Asperger syndrome. [...] "As president of The National Autistic Society, Asperger's is something I've worked with for 25 years. When Holby approached the society about this plot concerning the boy with Asperger's syndrome, they said, 'Do you realise the woman involved in this storyline is our president?'. So I was able to help out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fafhrd {{commonly}} uses a sword {{which he}} names Graywand, a two-hand sword that he's {{able to use}} one-handed too (in later episodes by necessity). He also carries a poignard named Heartseeker and a short hand-axe which has never been named. For combat at a distance, he often carries a bow and arrow which he wields effectively even while on horseback or at sea, and which he's able to use despite his final handicap (he loses a hand). The Mouser, in one episode called [...] "the best swordsman in the World", also fights {{with a pair of}} weapons: a [...] "slim, curving" [...] sword or sabre called Scalpel, and a dagger called Cat's Claw, the latter usually hidden in the small of the Mouser's back, and the original of which had a very subtle curve. (It was a straight-bladed weapon by the events of Lean Times in Lankhmar.) [...] As the pair are often divested of their property, these are names they apply to any of their appropriate weapons and not necessarily names of specific ones. They are absolutely not magic weapons: both the wielders are just very able to use them. The Mouser is also an expert with the sling. The Mouser, having been an apprentice magician, <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>some</b> very small enchantments, especially while dueling.|$|E
