50|$|The Works of Reza Khodadadi present various of {{aspects of}} {{assembling}} patterns and shapes alongside {{each other in}} mixed media. Continuity and colored material play an integral part in his art. His love for Rum′s poetic narrative to his paintings.in series 'Heyrani'(Perplexity) the viewers face an abstract work which allows {{them to make a}} literal 'Reading' of visual expression. The Perplexity series is Created with carefully drawn overlapping lines. These lines stand out in the background even though they are at times diluted, and their resemblance to straw and hay gives the painting the feel of a landscape. These landscapes seem distant from eastern landscapes yet during his creative process Khodadadi distances his work from these familiar scenes. The over-stacking and criss- <b>crossing</b> <b>of</b> <b>lines</b> confer on the painting a feeling of pattern. Straight lines begin to curl and give a feel of wind and dishevelment that can be fathomed as tantamount to perplexity or bewilderment. The Contrasting lines play an integral part in the aesthetics of this painting while the colors are form the same group (unless used for background spacing). Line segments are the simplest of visual ingredients, yet the artist, through detailed stacking and shading, has turned them into patterns.A sort of optical illusion is produced by this stacking that concentrates how they are viewed. This can clearly be seen in the works of Victor Vasarely (1906-1997) and Bridget Riley (b.1931) whose works stress the relationship of form and narrative. In fact Khodadadi endeavors to portray these accomplishments of modern painting on a few level in his work. The envisioning of either a waxing or waning process while looking at the Perplexity(Bewildered) series is an example of this artifice. The relief-type textures Khodadadi also adhere to the amassing of one form and its transformations. By changing integral aspects of shapes, patterns and patina he creates diversity within the redundant rhythm of shapes.The painting of Khodadadi′s 'Perplexity' series focus on the flow of a landscape and its transformation to patterns and on how a chaotic atmosphere and immense and graduated space can be reproduced on canvas or vice versa.It is as if perspective appears and disappears through the brushing aside of the fields of straw. Simultaneously these are simply works of art with visual elements that under their own layers find connections to literary subjects.|$|E

In each of 4 experiments, 30 participants responded to interpretive questions that required comparisons among {{the elements of the}} graph. Knowledge provided to participants differed across Experiments 1 a, 1 b, and 1 c; question demands varied in Experiment 2. Analysis of response latencies showed that <b>crossing</b> <b>of</b> <b>lines</b> is the most influential variable independent of orientation, dot adjustment, and question demands. Speed of comprehension decreased with increasing question demands. When question demands were high, orientation of lines also had an effect on speed of comprehension.

Odessa Research Field was established in 1894 to study the agrotechnics of agricultural crops, in particular, Winter Wheat. The Breeding department at Odessa Research Field was established in 8 th of March, 1912, and headed by Private- Docent of Novorossiysk University, A. O. Sapegin. The main procedure applied in breeding was individual multifold selection of elite ears from the existing local blends and artificial <b>crossing</b> <b>of</b> <b>lines</b> selected to the purpose of improving economically valuable  characteristics and identifying the inheritance. Five years of breeding (1912 - 1917 pp.) resulted in creation of three Winter Wheat varieties: Kooperatorka (0194), Zemka (0158) and Stepniachka(0119). In 1918, the Council of People’s Commissars of USSR has parted the Breeding department of Odessa Research Field to independent Odessa agricultural breeding station recognizing development of plant varieties by the Department...|$|E
40|$|When {{creating}} Triticum aestivum L. varieties in V. M. Remeslo Myronivka Institute of Wheat, intervarietal crossing {{was used}} as the basis for classical method of hybridization. Parental pairs were selected according to environmental and geographical principles. <b>Crossing</b> <b>of</b> <b>lines</b> selected by certain adaptive characteristics among themselves and with the local breeding varieties are widely used. The method of induced mutagenesis {{is one of the main}} factor of the evolutionary process which increases hundreds of times the frequency of altered forms occurrence. Thermal mutagenesis – selection of winter forms from spring varieties – is based on low temperature effect on spring wheat varieties (it was developed by V. M. Remeslo, the member of the Academy of Sciences). Method of intervarietal selection in winter wheat breeding provides creation of new varieties of this crop through mass selection of the best plants from local populations. At present, 10 varieties of winter wheat are included into the State Register of Plant Varieties Suitable for Dissemination in Ukraine, one variety – into the State Register of Breeding Achievements of the Russian Federation, seven varieties are passing state quality testing in these countries...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – In this paper, {{causes of}} {{improper}} interleaving of two DCM/CCM boundary boost PFC converters around zero <b>crossing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>line</b> voltage are analyzed. The converters have a master-slave relationship. The slave is synchronized to the turn-on instant {{of the master}} by using an open-loop interleaving method. It is shown that phase shifting the gate drive signals of the two stages by 180 ° does not provide 180 ° phase-shift between the individual inductor currents, which is the real purpose of interleaving. Fortunately, the improper interleaving around zero <b>crossing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>line</b> voltage does not deteriorate the power factor (PF) and total harmonic distortion (THD). It is shown that although the interleaving method can be improved to achieve close to 180 ° phase shift between the master and slave currents even around zero <b>crossing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>line</b> voltage, the improved interleaving has only a minor effect on the PF and THD.
