5|$|Cocker Spaniels are dogs {{belonging}} to two breeds of the spaniel dog type: the American <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> and the English <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel,</b> {{both of which}} are commonly called simply <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> in their countries of origin. In the early 20th century, Cocker Spaniels also included small hunting Spaniels.|$|E
5|$|Cocker Spaniels were {{recognized}} by the AKC in 1878. Generally smaller than its English cousin, separate classes were created for the two types in America in 1935 and the <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> Club of America discouraged breeding between the two types in 1938. The American <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> was recognized as a separate breed by the KC in the UK in 1970. The American <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> {{is referred to as}} the <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> within the United States.|$|E
5|$|Called simply <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> in the UK, this is {{the breed}} that was {{originally}} recognized by The Kennel Club (KC) in 1892. The American Kennel Club (AKC) recognized the English <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> as a separate breed in 1946.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is study of the {{available}} literature sources that deal with issue of color, temperament and effect of color to character traits of English <b>cocker</b> <b>spaniels</b> and assess difference of temperament between solid coloured and particoloured lines of English cockers in the Czech Republic. The object of evaluation is 68 English <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniels</b> - 21 black, 23 golden and 24 particolouredBy virtue of answers of their owners it is assessed dominance, aggression towards adults, children and dogs, intensity of barking, playfulness, dependence on the owner and destroying thingsSolid colored <b>cocker</b> <b>spaniels</b> are more dominant, aggressive, a little more barking and they are more dependence on the owner than particoloured <b>cocker</b> <b>spaniels.</b> Particoloured <b>cockers</b> are the most playful. Things are most often destroyed by the black cockers and least often by the golden cockers...|$|R

5|$|In {{its native}} United States, the American <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> was ranked the 23rd most popular breed {{according}} to registration statistics of the AKC in 2009, {{a decrease in}} popularity since 1999 when it was ranked 13th. For twenty five years the American <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> {{was the most popular}} dog in America. It was ranked number one first in 1936 prior to the English <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> being recognized as a separate breed, and held onto the spot until 1952 when Beagles became the most popular dog. It regained the spot in 1983 and held on at number one until 1990. In the UK, the American <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> is far less popular than its English cousin with 322 registrations compared to the English Cocker's 22,211 in 2009.|$|E

5|$|There are two modern breeds of <b>cocker</b> <b>spaniel,</b> the English <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> and the American <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel.</b> They were bred as gun dogs; to {{use their}} sense of smell to cover low areas near the handler in order to flush birds into the air to be shot, and {{to use their}} eyes and nose to locate the bird once downed, and then to {{retrieve}} the bird with a soft mouth. The major differences between the English and American varieties is that the American is smaller with a shorter back, a domed head and a shorter muzzle, while the English variety is taller with a narrower head and chest.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{the breed}} had become popular in America and Canada due to their dual use as a family pet and a working dog. In the early 20th century the breeders {{on either side of the}} Atlantic had created {{different}} breed standards for the <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> and the breed gradually diverged from one another, with the two becoming noticeably different by the 1920s. The American Cockers by now had a smaller muzzle, their coats were softer and the dogs overall were lighter and smaller. The differences were so apparent that in 1935, breeders founded the English <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> Club and restricted breeding between the two types of spaniel. The two types of <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> in America were shown together as one breed, with the English type as a variety of the main breed, until 1946 when the American Kennel Club recognised the English <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> as a separate breed.|$|E
5|$|According to {{historical}} records, the first spaniel {{was brought to}} North America aboard the Mayflower which sailed from Plymouth, England and landed in New England in 1620. The first <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> recorded in America was a liver and white dog named Captain, who was registered with the American Kennel Club in 1878. In 1881, the American <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> Club was formed; it would later become the American Spaniel Club (ASC) and {{is now known as}} the oldest breed club for dogs in the United States. The task of the club was initially to create a standard to separate the <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> in America from other types of land spaniels, a task which would take over 20 years, only being completed in 1905.|$|E
5|$|American Cocker Spaniels {{have had}} several {{links to the}} United States Presidency. In 1952, an American <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> became a {{household}} name when United States Senator Richard Nixon made his Checkers speech on 23 September. A parti-colored American <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> named Dot {{was one of several}} dogs owned by Rutherford B. Hayes; and a buff colored dog named Feller caused a scandal for Harry S. Truman when the dog was received as an unwanted gift with the President subsequently giving it away to a White House physician. More recently, a Cocker named Zeke lived with Bill Clinton while he was Arkansas Governor.|$|E
5000|$|The eh sable {{extension}} allele {{has been}} studied only in English <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniels</b> and produces sable {{in the presence of}} dominant black KB and tan point at/at. Its expression is dependent upon the animal not possessing Em nor E nor being homozygous for e. eh is theorized to be on the E locus and to have no effect on ky/ky dogs. All <b>cocker</b> <b>spaniels</b> are homozygous for at, so it is unknown how the gene may function in the presence of other A-series alleles.|$|R
50|$|The {{genetics}} behind roan {{dogs are}} still unclear, and at present candidate genes have been ruled out. There remains {{a great deal}} of ambiguity in terminology regarding mottled dogs, which are called roan, ticked, mottled and belton depending on the context. The roan or ticked color is described in many breeds of gundogs such as English <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniels,</b> American <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniels,</b> English Springer Spaniels, Field Spaniels and Brittanys, German Longhaired Pointers, German Shorthaired Pointers, Spinoni Italiani, Lagotto Romagnolos and English Setters, as well as Border Collies and many other breeds.|$|R

5|$|American Cocker Spaniels in UK and USA/Canada surveys had {{a median}} {{lifespan}} of about 10 to 11 years, {{which is on}} {{the low end of the}} typical range for purebred dogs, and one to two years less than other breeds of their size. The larger English <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> typically lives about a year longer than the American <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel.</b> In a 2004 UK Kennel Club survey, the most common causes of death were cancer (23%), old age (20%), cardiac (8%), and immune-mediated (8%). In a 2003 USA/Canada Health Survey with a smaller sample size, the leading causes of death were cancer, hepatic disease, and immune-mediated.|$|E
5|$|In {{a survey}} {{conducted}} by the Kennel Club (UK), the American Cocker Spaniels had a median age of death of ten years and four months, while the English <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> had a median age of eleven years and two months. According to the survey, {{the most common cause of}} death for both breeds was cancer, while old age was the second most common cause. The two modern breeds are susceptible to several health problems. Issues common to the two breeds include ear infections, and a variety of eye problems. A large number of breeds are susceptible to hip dysplasia. In {{a survey conducted}} by Orthopedic Foundation for Animals, the American <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> was ranked 115th out of 157 different breeds, with 1 being the highest percentage dysplastic and 157 being the lowest percentage dysplastic. The English Cocker was ranked 129th.|$|E

5|$|<b>Cocker</b> <b>spaniel</b> coats come in {{a variety}} of colors {{including}} black, liver, red and golden in solids. There are also black and tan, and sometimes liver and tan, as well as a variety of color mixtures of those solid colors including roans, roan and tans, tricolors and those solid colors with additional white markings.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1870s, {{the only}} {{requirement}} {{for a dog}} to be classed as a <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> was that it needed to weigh less than , although breeders separated the cocker from the King Charles Spaniel which remains a smaller breed of spaniel. This maximum weight limit remained on the <b>Cocker</b> <b>Spaniel</b> until 1900, with larger dogs being classed as Springer Spaniels. The colors of the Devonshire and Welsh Cockers were described by John Henry Walsh under the pseudonym Stonehenge in his book The Dog in Health and Disease as being a deeper shade of liver {{than that of the}} Sussex Spaniel. Following the formation of The Kennel Club in the UK in 1873, efforts were made by breeders to record the pedigrees of cockers and springers. In 1892, English Cocker Spaniels and English Springer Spaniels were recognized as separate breeds by The Kennel Club.|$|E
