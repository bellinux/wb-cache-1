5000|$|The exact {{meaning of}} the [...] "p" [...] in [...] "pH" [...] is disputed, but {{according}} to the Carlsberg Foundation, pH stands for [...] "power of hydrogen". It has also been suggested that the [...] "p" [...] stands for the German Potenz (meaning [...] "power"), others refer to French puissance (also meaning [...] "power", {{based on the fact that}} the Carlsberg Laboratory was French-speaking). Another suggestion is that the [...] "p" [...] stands for the Latin terms pondus hydrogenii (quantity of hydrogen), potentia hydrogenii (capacity of hydrogen), or potential hydrogen. It is also suggested that Sørensen used the letters [...] "p" [...] and [...] "q" [...] (commonly paired letters in mathematics) simply to label the test solution (p) and the reference solution (q). Currently in chemistry, the p stands for [...] "decimal <b>cologarithm</b> of", and is also used in the term pKa, used for acid dissociation constants.|$|E
5000|$|... has a value {{close to}} 10−14 at 25 °C, so the {{concentration}} of hydroxide ions in pure water is close to 10−7 mol∙dm−3, {{in order to satisfy}} the equal charge constraint. The pH of a solution is equal to the decimal <b>cologarithm</b> of the hydrogen cation concentration; the pH of pure water is close to 7 at ambient temperatures. The concentration of hydroxide ions can be expressed in terms of pOH, which is close to 14 − pH, so pOH of pure water is also close to 7. Addition of a base to water will reduce the hydrogen cation concentration and therefore increase the hydroxide ion concentration (increase pH, decrease pOH) even if the base does not itself contain hydroxide. For example, ammonia solutions have a pH greater than 7 due to the reaction NH3 + H+ [...] , which results in a decrease in hydrogen cation concentration and an increase in hydroxide ion concentration. pOH can be kept at a nearly constant value with various buffer solutions.|$|E
