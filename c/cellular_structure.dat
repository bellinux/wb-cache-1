5|$|From 1870 to 1880 {{it became}} clear that cell nuclei are never formed anew but always derived from the {{substance}} of another nucleus. In 1882 Flemming observed the longitudinal splitting of chromosomes in the dividing nucleus and concluded that each daughter nucleus received half of each of the chromosomes of the mother nucleus: then by the early 20th century {{it was found that the}} number of chromosomes in a given species is constant. With genetic continuity confirmed and the finding by Eduard Strasburger that the nuclei of reproductive cells (in pollen and embryo) have a reducing division (halving of chromosomes, now known as meiosis) the field of heredity was opened up. By 1926 Thomas Morgan was able to outline a theory of the gene and its structure and function. The form and function of plastids received similar attention, the association with starch being noted at an early date. With observation of the <b>cellular</b> <b>structure</b> of all organisms and the process of cell division and continuity of genetic material, the analysis of the structure of protoplasm and the cell wall as well as that of plastids and vacuoles – what is now known as cytology, or cell theory became firmly established.|$|E

40|$|The use of cobalt {{chromium}} (CoCr) in orthopaedic joint replacement shields the peri-implant bone stress, {{contributing to a}} premature loosening of the implants. In {{order to reduce the}} need for revision surgeries, light weight implants with tailored functionalities need to be developed. In this study, the compressive mechanical properties of laser-melted CoCr <b>cellular</b> <b>structures</b> with a pillar octahedral architecture [0 ° ± 45 °] were investigated. Four types of graded <b>cellular</b> <b>structures,</b> based on grading orientations along radial and longitudinal planes, were manufactured using selective laser melting techniques. The <b>cellular</b> <b>structures</b> in this study have the mechanical properties (E = 2. 3 - 3. 1 GPa, σ = 113 – 523 MPa) compatible with bone structures. Grading a porosity of the CoCr <b>cellular</b> <b>structures</b> provides a greater stress transfer to the proximal peri-implant area. The axially graded <b>cellular</b> <b>structures</b> demonstrated significant reduction of the peri-implant stress shielding.

This {{paper is to}} seek optimal <b>cellular</b> <b>structures</b> as the core architectures of parts manufactured by selective laser melting (SLM) technology, which provides required mechanical properties. Design features for characterizing optimal structural performance are discussed.

Compression tests are also carried out to seek <b>cellular</b> <b>structures</b> of synthetically optimal mechanical properties. Comparing the effects of the unit cell architecture and the relative density on mechanical properties, it reveals that unit cell architecture is dominant rather than the relative density, and the truss lattice with [90 °,± 45 °] structure is the overall best performing among the selected <b>cellular</b> <b>structures...</b>|$|R

25|$|Those species {{which have}} {{relatively}} large dry seeds have a dark, crust-like (crustose) outer layer containing the pigment phytomelan. However, some species with hairy seeds (e.g. Eriospermum, family Asparagaceae s.l.), berries (e.g. Maianthemum, family Asparagaceae s.l.), or highly reduced seeds (e.g. orchids) lack this dark pigment in their seed coats. Phytomelan {{is not unique}} to Asparagales (i.e. it is not a synapomorphy) but it is common within the order and rare outside it. The inner portion of the seed coat is usually completely collapsed. In contrast, the morphologically similar seeds of Liliales have no phytomelan, and usually retain a <b>cellular</b> <b>structure</b> in the inner portion of the seed coat.|$|E
25|$|Anti-microtubule {{agents are}} plant-derived {{chemicals}} that block cell division by preventing microtubule function. Microtubules {{are an important}} <b>cellular</b> <b>structure</b> composed of two proteins; α-tubulin and β-tubulin. They are hollow rod shaped structures that are required for cell division, among other cellular functions. Microtubules are dynamic structures, {{which means that they}} are permanently in a state of assembly and disassembly. Vinca alkaloids and taxanes are the two main groups of anti-microtubule agents, and although both of these groups of drugs cause microtubule dysfunction, their mechanisms of action are completely opposite. The vinca alkaloids prevent the formation of the microtubules, whereas the taxanes prevent the microtubule disassembly. By doing so, they prevent the cancer cells from completing mitosis. Following this, cell cycle arrest occurs, which induces programmed cell death (apoptosis). Also, these drugs can affect blood vessel growth; an essential process that tumours utilise in order to grow and metastasise.|$|E

Based on the structure-preserving {{characteristics}} of the symplectic algorithm, the wave propagation problem of auxetic <b>cellular</b> <b>structures</b> is analyzed and compared with conventional cellular materials. The dispersion relations along the first Brillouin zone boundary and the contour plots of phase constant surfaces are obtained using the finite element method.

25|$|Hills and Nakamura had {{a vision}} of feeding the world from lakes, seas and {{backyard}} aquaculture and in 1975 they authored a book, Food from Sunlight which published all their proprietary research as open source for the world to use in the cause against global famine and malnutrition. Their company, Microalgae International, invested in research and technology to find a super food for solving World Hunger. Early research focused on chlorella but its <b>cellular</b> <b>structure</b> was too small to be collected without expensive centrifuges. However, in 1967, while Dr Nakamura was living at Centre House, they discovered that women at Lake Chad were harvesting an algae in baskets to make dihé, a highly nutritious sun-baked biscuit. After studying the lakes of Africa, Hills and Dr Nakamura developed seed culture for a strain of 70% protein algae called spirulina that they had collected from Lake Aranguachi in Ethiopia. Later, in 1981, Dr Hills made an expedition to Lake Chiltu at the invitation of Mr. Wollie Chekal, Minister of Trade for the Ethiopian Revolutionary Government and brought back a new set of spirulina samples to his California laboratory for hybridizing an optimal strain for commercial cultivation.|$|E
25|$|Just {{behind the}} presumed {{position}} of the stomach a very conspicuous large and thick intestine is visible, that {{has been identified as}} the duodenum. It is preserved partly {{in the form of a}} natural endocast, partly as a petrification still showing the <b>cellular</b> <b>structure,</b> including the mucosa and connective tissue. Some mesenteric blood vessels cover the intestine in the form of up to a centimetre long and 0.02 to 0.1 millimetre wide hollow tubes. The duodenum forms a large loop, the descending part of which first is directed downwards towards the gastralia and then runs to the back. There in a sharp bend, the folds of which are clearly visible, it turns to the front, proceeding as an ascending tract, its visible part ending near the stomach. At this point the tract is directed to the left of the body, perpendicular to the fossil slab, and its course can thus no longer be followed. Nearby and slightly above, a subsequent intestine part surfaces that has been interpreted as the jejunum. This thinner intestine turns to the back, running parallel to the ascending tract of the duodenum and ultimately disappearing under it, at the level of the twelfth dorsal vertebra. Apparently a loop to the front is made because it resurfaces below the tenth dorsal vertebra, first running upwards and then turning to the back below the hind vertebral column — or at places even over it: probably after death its position partly shifted upwards. The jejunum seems to blend with an exceptionally short ileum. A contraction below the thirteenth dorsal vertebra might indicate the transition to the rectum. A caecum seems absent. The rectum runs to the back between the upper shafts of the pubes and ischia. Then it bends downwards parallel to the ischium shaft, at the end of it turning upwards again. In this final part faeces are still present. The cloaca is lacking. Dal Sasso & Maganuco suggested the cloaca exit was rather low, at the level of the ischial feet and that a rectocoprodaeal valve separated faeces and urine.|$|E
500|$|Conserving {{the hull}} of the Mary Rose was the most {{complicated}} and expensive task for the project. In 2002 a donation of [...] from the Heritage Lottery Fund and equivalent monetary support from the Portsmouth City and Hampshire County Councils was {{needed to keep the}} work with conservation on schedule. During passive conservation, the ship structure could for practical reasons not be completely sealed, so instead it was regularly sprayed with filtered, recycled water that was kept at a temperature of 2 to 5°C (35 to 41°F) to keep it from drying out. Drying waterlogged wood that has been submerged for several centuries without appropriate conservation causes considerable shrinkage (20–50%) and leads to severe warping and cracking as water evaporates from the <b>cellular</b> <b>structure</b> of the wood. The substance polyethylene glycol (PEG) had been used before on archaeological wood, and was during the 1980s being used to conserve the Vasa. After almost ten years of small-scale trials on timbers, an active three-phase conservation programme of {{the hull of}} the Mary Rose began in 1994. During the first phase, which lasted from 1994 to 2003, the wood was sprayed with low-molecular-weight PEG to replace the water in the <b>cellular</b> <b>structure</b> of the wood. From 2003 to 2010, a higher-molecular-weight PEG was used to strengthen the mechanical properties of the outer surface layers. The third phase consisted of a controlled air drying ending in 2016.|$|E
40|$|The {{subcellular}} localization of the exoribonuclease RNase II is {{not known}} despite the advanced biochemical characterization of the enzyme. Here we report that RNase II is organized into <b>cellular</b> <b>structures</b> that appear to coil around the Escherichia coli cell periphery and that RNase II {{is associated with the}} cytoplasmic membrane by its aminoterminal amphipathic helix. The helix also acts as an autonomous transplantable membranebinding domain capable of directing normally cytoplasmic proteins to the membrane. Assembly of the organized <b>cellular</b> <b>structures</b> of RNase II required the RNase II amphipathic membrane-binding domain. Coimmunoprecipitation of the protein from cell extracts indicated that RNase II interacts with itself. The RNase II self-interaction and the ability of the protein to assemble into organized <b>cellular</b> <b>structures</b> required the membrane binding domain. The ability of RNase II to maintain cell viability {{in the absence of the}} exoribonuclease PNPase was markedly diminished when the RNase II <b>cellular</b> <b>structures</b> were lost due to changes in the amphipathicity of the N-terminal helix, suggesting that membrane association and assembly of RNase II into organized <b>cellular</b> <b>structures</b> play an important role in the normal function of the protein within the bacterial cell...|$|R

Accepted forms of life use cell division to reproduce, whereas viruses spontaneously assemble within cells. They differ from autonomous growth of crystals as they inherit genetic mutations while being subject to natural selection. Virus self-assembly within host cells has implications for the study of the origin of life, as it lends further credence to the hypothesis that life could have started as self-assembling organic molecules.|$|E

These include ultra-light structures, thermal and acoustic insulators, and impact amelioration systems, among others. <b>Cellular</b> <b>structures</b> with deterministic architecture can be considered as example of periodic structures. Periodic structures feature unique wave propagation characteristics, whereby elastic waves propagate only in specific frequency bands, known as "pass band", while they are attenuated in all other frequency bands, known as "stop bands". Such dynamic properties are here exploited to provide <b>cellular</b> <b>structures</b> with the capability of behaving as directional, pass-band mechanical filters, thus complementing their well documented multifunctional characteristics. This work presents a methodology for the analysis of the dynamic behavior of periodic <b>cellular</b> <b>structures,</b> which allows the evaluation of location and spectral width of propagation and attenuation regions. The filtering characteristics are tested and demonstrated for structures of various geometry and topology, including cylindrical grid-like structures, Kagom and eacute; and tetrhedral truss core lattices.
