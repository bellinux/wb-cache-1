The player takes the role of one such devil child, and battles against demons; the devil <b>children</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> fight directly themselves, however, but have allied demons in their party fight for them. The player can choose to talk to demons instead of fighting them, {{to try to make}} them join the player's party, and can increase their allied demons' power by fusing multiple demons with each other.|$|E
5|$|Domain-general {{views of}} {{vocabulary}} development argue that <b>children</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> need principles or constraints {{in order to}} successfully develop word-world mappings. Instead, word learning can be accounted for through general learning mechanisms such as salience, association, and frequency. Children are thought to notice the objects, actions, or events that are most salient in context, and then to associate them with the words that are most frequently used in their presence. Additionally, research on word learning suggests that fast mapping, the rapid learning that children display after a single exposure to new information, is not specific to word learning. Children can also successfully fast map when exposed to a novel fact, remembering both words and facts after a time delay.|$|E

5|$|As {{children}} get older their rate of vocabulary growth increases. Children probably understand their first 50 words before they produce them. By {{the age of}} eighteen months, children typically attain a vocabulary of 50 words in production, and between two and three times greater in comprehension. A switch from {{an early stage of}} slow vocabulary growth to a later stage of faster growth {{is referred to as the}} vocabulary spurt. Young toddlers acquire one to three words per month. A vocabulary spurt often occurs over time as the number of words learned accelerates. It is believed that most children add about 10 to 20 new words a week. Between the ages of 18 to 24 months, children learn how to combine two words such as no bye-bye and more please. Three-word and four-word combinations appear when most of the child's utterances are two-word productions. In addition, children are able to form conjoined sentences, using and. This suggests that there is a vocabulary spurt between the time that the child's first word appears, and when the child is able to form more than two words, and eventually, sentences. However, there have been arguments as to whether or not there is a spurt in acquisition of words. Only about one in five children do have a spurt. This suggests that most <b>children</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have a vocabulary spurt.|$|E

25|$|Turkle {{talks about}} the nature of privacy in the post 9/11 world, arguing that privacy was sacrificed in {{exchange}} for safety. Turkle argues that because they have grown up as part of a world in which privacy is regarded as increasingly tenuous, <b>children</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> always appreciate the full value of privacy, which in turn causes them to share even more personal details on the web. This further depreciates the value of privacy in a self-perpetuating cycle.|$|E
25|$|There {{are mixed}} results in how {{important}} phonological information is to deaf individuals when reading {{and when that}} information is obtained. Alphabets, abugidas, abjads, and syllabaries all seem to require the reader/writer {{to know something about}} the phonology of their target language prior to learning the system. Profoundly deaf <b>children</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have access to the same auditory base that hearing children do. Orally trained deaf <b>children</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> always use phonological information in reading tasks, word recognition tasks or homophonic tasks; however, deaf signers who are not orally trained do utilize phonological information in word-rhyming tasks. Furthermore when performing on tasks with phonologically confusable initial sounds, hearing readers made more errors than deaf readers. Yet when given sentences that are sublexically confusable when translated into ASL, deaf readers made more errors than hearing readers. The body of literature clearly shows that skilled deaf readers can employ phonological skills, even if they don’t all the time; without additional longitudinal studies it is uncertain if a profoundly deaf person must know something about the phonology of the target language to become a skilled reader (less than 75% of the deaf population) or if by becoming a skilled reader a deaf person learns how to employ phonological skills of the target language.|$|E
25|$|Compared to children, {{adolescents}} {{are more likely}} to question others' assertions, and less likely to accept facts as absolute truths. Through experience outside the family circle, they learn that rules they were taught as absolute are in fact relativistic. They begin to differentiate between rules instituted out of common sense—not touching a hot stove—and those that are based on culturally-relative standards (codes of etiquette, not dating until a certain age), a delineation that younger <b>children</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> make. This can lead to a period of questioning authority in all domains.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} runs {{a number}} of public elementary and secondary-level schools, as youth in Guatemala do not fully participate in education. These schools are free, though the cost of uniforms, books, supplies, and transportation makes them less accessible to the poorer segments of society and significant numbers of poor <b>children</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> attend school. Many middle and upper-class children go to private schools. Guatemala has one public university (USAC or Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala), and fourteen private ones (see List of universities in Guatemala).

The Ministry of Labour has also included street children in their livelihood training programmes, though this has been met with minimal success because many street <b>children</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have the education necessary to participate in the programmes.|$|E
25|$|Resilience in {{children}} refers {{to individuals who}} are doing better than expected, given a history that includes risk or adverse experience.

There {{is no such thing as}} an 'invulnerable child' that can overcome any obstacle or adversity that he or she encounters in life—and in fact, the trait is quite common. Resilience is the product of a large number of developmental processes over time, that has allowed children who experience some sort of risk to continue to develop competently (while other <b>children</b> <b>do</b> <b>not).</b>|$|E

25|$|Historical examples, {{such as the}} {{hookworm}} {{campaigns in}} Mississippi and Florida from 1943 to 1947 {{have shown that the}} primary cause of hookworm infection is poor sanitation, which can be solved by building and maintaining toilets. But while these may seem like simple tasks, they raise important public health challenges. Most infected populations are from poverty-stricken areas with very poor sanitation. Thus, it is most likely that at-risk <b>children</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have access to clean water to wash their hands and live in environments with no proper sanitation infrastructure. Health education, therefore, must address preventive measures in ways that are both feasible and sustainable in the context of resource-limited settings.|$|E
25|$|Most young <b>children</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> {{show any}} {{physical}} signs of FXS. It is not until puberty that physical features of FXS begin to develop. Aside from intellectual disability, prominent {{characteristics of the}} syndrome may include an elongated face, large or protruding ears, flat feet, larger testes (macroorchidism), and low muscle tone. Recurrent otitis media (middle ear infection) and sinusitis is common during early childhood. Speech may be cluttered or nervous. Behavioral characteristics may include stereotypic movements (e.g., hand-flapping) and atypical social development, particularly shyness, limited eye contact, memory problems, and difficulty with face encoding. Some individuals with fragile X syndrome also meet the diagnostic criteria for autism.|$|E
25|$|C-PTSD is also {{characterized}} by attachment disorder, particularly the pervasive insecure, or disorganized-type attachment. DSM-IV (1994) dissociative disorders and PTSD {{do not include}} insecure attachment in their criteria. As a consequence of this aspect of C-PTSD, when some adults with C-PTSD become parents and confront their own children's attachment needs, they may have particular difficulty in responding sensitively especially to their infants' and young children's routine distress—such as during routine separations, despite these parents' best intentions and efforts. Although {{the great majority of}} survivors do not abuse others, this difficulty in parenting may have adverse repercussions for their children's social and emotional development if parents with this condition and their <b>children</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> receive appropriate treatment.|$|E
50|$|Tomasello {{argues that}} in {{learning}} linguistic symbols, the <b>child</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> {{need to have}} explicit external linguistic contrasts, and rather, will learn about these concepts via social context ant their surroundings.
