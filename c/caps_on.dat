5|$|Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) is a {{kind and}} loving boy living in poverty with his parents (Noah Taylor and Helena Bonham Carter) and four {{bedridden}} grandparents. They all rely on his father for income, employed at a toothpaste factory, responsible for putting the <b>caps</b> <b>on</b> the tubes. However, Mr. Bucket eventually loses his job because the factory replaced him with a machine that puts the <b>caps</b> <b>on</b> the tubes. Down the street is Willy Wonka's (Johnny Depp) chocolate factory, which reopened after industrial espionage forced him into seclusion and sacking his employees. Charlie's Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) worked for Wonka before the termination.|$|E
5|$|In recent decades, South Dakota {{has been}} {{transformed}} from a state dominated by agriculture to one with a more diversified economy. The tourism industry has grown considerably since {{the completion of the}} interstate system in the 1960s, with the Black Hills becoming more important as a destination. The financial service industry began to grow in the state as well, with Citibank moving its credit card operations from New York to Sioux Falls in 1981, a move that has been followed by several other financial companies. South Dakota was the first state to eliminate <b>caps</b> <b>on</b> interest rates.|$|E
5000|$|Only {{two other}} states, Kansas and Montana, have a <b>cap</b> <b>on</b> non-economic damages in medical {{malpractice}} cases {{as low as}} California’s. In 21 states and the District of Columbia there is no <b>cap</b> <b>on</b> medical malpractice damage awards. (That includes two states, Maine and Oregon, that have no specific <b>cap</b> <b>on</b> medical malpractice damages but have a <b>cap</b> <b>on</b> noneconomic damages in any wrongful death action.) Six other states have no <b>cap</b> <b>on</b> medical malpractice damages under some circumstances. Florida joined that list in 2014 when the Florida Supreme Court struck down its <b>cap</b> <b>on</b> non-economic damages in medical malpractice cases involving wrongful death.|$|R

50|$|Federal law {{currently}} sets {{an annual}} <b>cap</b> <b>on</b> {{the amount of}} payments that a person may receive from the major farm programs. A provision in this law permits a person to receive payments up to the full <b>cap</b> <b>on</b> the first farm in which the person has a substantial beneficial interest, and up to half the full <b>cap</b> <b>on</b> each of two additional farms; hence the so-called three-entity rule.|$|R
5|$|Theoretical models {{predict that}} {{volatile}} compounds {{such as water}} and carbon dioxide, if present, might evaporate in the scorching heat of the sunward side, migrate to the cooler night side, and condense to form ice caps. Over time, the entire atmosphere might freeze into ice <b>caps</b> <b>on</b> the night side of the planet. However, it remains unknown if water and/or carbon dioxide are even present {{on the surface of}} Gliese 581c. Alternatively, an atmosphere large enough to be stable would circulate the heat more evenly, allowing for a wider habitable area on the surface. For example, although Venus has a small axial inclination, very little sunlight reaches the surface at the poles. A slow rotation rate approximately 117 times slower than Earth's produces prolonged days and nights. Despite the uneven distribution of sunlight cast on Venus at any given time, polar areas and the night side of Venus are kept almost as hot as on the day side by globally circulating winds.|$|E
5|$|For most of history, {{humanity}} did {{not recognize}} or {{understand the concept of}} the Solar System. Most people up to the Late Middle Ages–Renaissance believed Earth to be stationary at the centre of the universe and categorically different from the divine or ethereal objects that moved through the sky. Although the Greek philosopher Aristarchus of Samos had speculated on a heliocentric reordering of the cosmos, Nicolaus Copernicus was the first to develop a mathematically predictive heliocentric system. In the 17th century, Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler, and Isaac Newton developed an understanding of physics that led to the gradual acceptance of the idea that Earth moves around the Sun and that the planets are governed by the same physical laws that governed Earth. The invention of the telescope led to the discovery of further planets and moons. Improvements in the telescope and the use of unmanned spacecraft have enabled the investigation of geological phenomena, such as mountains, craters, seasonal meteorological phenomena, such as clouds, dust storms and ice <b>caps</b> <b>on</b> the other planets.|$|E
5|$|In March 2011 a new {{reform of}} the Stability and Growth Pact was initiated, aiming at {{straightening}} the rules by adopting an automatic procedure for imposing of penalties in case of breaches of either the 3% deficit or the 60% debt rules. By {{the end of the}} year, Germany, France and some other smaller EU countries went a step further and vowed to create a fiscal union across the eurozone with strict and enforceable fiscal rules and automatic penalties embedded in the EU treaties. On 9 December 2011 at the European Council meeting, all 17 members of the eurozone and six countries that aspire to join agreed on a new intergovernmental treaty to put strict <b>caps</b> <b>on</b> government spending and borrowing, with penalties for those countries who violate the limits. All other non-eurozone countries apart from the UK are also prepared to join in, subject to parliamentary vote. The treaty will enter into force on 1 January 2013, if by that time 12 members of the euro area have ratified it.|$|E

25|$|Cap {{structure}} is sometimes expressed as initial adjustment cap / subsequent adjustment cap / life cap, for example 2/2/5 {{for a loan}} with a 2% <b>cap</b> <b>on</b> the initial adjustment, a 2% <b>cap</b> <b>on</b> subsequent adjustments, and a 5% <b>cap</b> <b>on</b> total interest rate adjustments. When only two values are given, this indicates that the initial change cap and periodic cap are the same. For example, a 2/2/5 cap structure may sometimes be written simply 2/5.|$|R
40|$|There are {{currently}} several {{ideas on the}} table for a climate treaty post-Kyoto. We consider the impact on China of three ideas: a <b>cap</b> <b>on</b> the CO 2 intensity, a <b>cap</b> <b>on</b> the CO 2 level, and a <b>cap</b> <b>on</b> the CO 2 intensity in key sectors. We find that a <b>cap</b> <b>on</b> the CO 2 intensity gives large environmental co-benefits to China on aggregate, but there are significant negative effects for rural households. Assuming these are addressed the country could reduce its CO 2 intensity by a third before costs outweigh environmental co-benefits. By contrast a cap confined to the manufacturing and power sector does not bring substantial co-benefits to China. Climate Commitment Treaty China...|$|R
