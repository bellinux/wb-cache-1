2500|$|In the 1950s, the {{dance-band}} {{ensemble of}} Rafael Cortijo and Ismael Rivera performed several [...] songs which they labelled as [...] "bombas"; although these bore some similarities to the sicá style of bomba, in their rhythms and horn arrangements they also borrowed noticeably from the Cuban dance music which {{had long been}} popular in the island. Giving rise to Charanga music. As of the 1980s, bomba had declined, although it was taught, in a somewhat formalized fashion, by the Cepeda family in Santurce, San Juan, and was still actively performed informally, though with much vigor, in the Loíza towns, home to then Ayala family dynasty of bomberos. Bomba continues to survive there, and has also experienced something of a revival, being cultivated by folkoric groups such as Son Del Batey, Los Rebuleadores de San Juan, Bomba Evolución, Abrane y La Tribu and many more else where in the island. In New York City with groups such as Los Pleneros de la 21, members of La Casita de <b>Chema,</b> and Alma Moyo. In Chicago Buya, and Afro Caribe have kept the tradition alive and evolving. In California Bomba Liberte, Bombalele, and Los Bomberas de la Bahia are all groups that have promoted and preserved the culture. Women have {{also played a role}} in its revival, {{as in the case of}} the all-female group Yaya, Legacy Woman, Los Bomberas de la Bahia, Grupo Bambula (Originally female group) and Ausuba in Puerto Rico.|$|E

Las <b>Chemas</b> were implicated in numerous kidnappings including that of two Swiss citizens, a diplomat Herman Buff and a student, Zack [...] Jazz Milis Martin. They reportedly received $700,000 in ransom, which {{is believed to have}} gone on to fund their drug trafficking empire.|$|R

50|$|At {{a thesis}} meeting, Professor Castro asks Ángela what she knows about Figueroa's death. Ángela denies all knowledge, but Castro has a {{security}} {{tape of the}} viewing room, which reveals Ángela passing by Figueroa's dead body and taking the video. As Ángela is about to admit why she took the tape, <b>Chema</b> calls. Ángela answers the phone in a separate room and <b>Chema</b> tells her to leave Castro's office immediately, saying that Castro {{is involved in the}} snuff film. Ángela hurriedly flees Castro's office. Later that day, Bosco's girlfriend, Yolanda, comes to Ángela, and explains that she, Vanessa, Bosco and a friend of Bosco's had been taking a class on snuff films two years ago with Professor Castro, when things began getting out of hand. Yolanda states that she believed that <b>Chema,</b> Bosco's old friend killed Vanessa {{in order to make the}} snuff film. Yolanda reveals that <b>Chema</b> was also in the snuff film class after stating that. Once with <b>Chema,</b> Angela asks him whether or not he knew Bosco, and <b>Chema</b> admits that he did, but that he left the snuff film class as soon as things got out of hand. At night, <b>Chema</b> shows Ángela the hidden library corridor he discovered on the security camera. Once in the corridor, they find shelves of video tapes, revealing that many other women, apart from Vanessa, had been murdered on camera. As they discover this, the door to the hidden corridor closes and they realize they have been locked inside. <b>Chema</b> and Ángela walk through the corridor, with only a match lighting their way. They realize they are going to die. <b>Chema</b> and Ángela fall asleep in each other's arms as the light of the last match dies.|$|E
50|$|In an {{interview}} published in 2001, <b>Chema</b> {{explains that he}} currently uses a Hasselblad camera to take his photos. The book, <b>Chema</b> Madoz: Objetos 1990 - 1999 was presumably shot entirely with this camera, rather than the 6&times;6 Mamiya he has used previously.|$|E

5000|$|The Cali Cartel, {{also known}} as [...] "Cali's Gentlemen," [...] was based in {{southern}} Colombia, around the city of Cali and the Valle del Cauca Department. The Cali Cartel was founded by the Rodríguez Orejuela brothers, Gilberto and Miguel, as well as associate José Santacruz Londoño. The Cali Cartel originally began as a ring of kidnappers known as Las <b>Chemas.</b> The profits of kidnapping helped finance the ring's move to drug trafficking, originally beginning in Marijuana and eventually spreading to cocaine. The cartel's estimated revenue would eventually reach an estimated $7 billion a year.|$|R

He's introduced as Matilda's boyfriend and the most popular boy in the school, who every girl wants to be with. He and Grachi start a relationship during the first season's last episodes. In season two, he and Leo become enemies, because both {{want to be with}} Grachi. During the third season, Daniel befriends with Leo, as he faces a new enemy, Axel.|$|R
50|$|When Ángela wakes, she {{discovers that}} the lights have turned {{back on and}} <b>Chema</b> is gone. She walks towards a doorway and is chloroformed. She awakes tied to a chair, facing Professor Castro. Castro apologizes to Ángela for having to kill her. He admits that he only edited the snuff videos, and that Ángela death would be much cleaner than Vanessa's. As he aims a gun at Ángela head, <b>Chema</b> appears and wrestles with Castro. The gun goes off, and Castro is killed. Ángela and <b>Chema</b> escape. Once at her house, Ángela father tells her that her sister, Sena, is at a party with Bosco. Terrified, Ángela hurries to the party. Once there, Sena refuses to leave with Ángela, insisting that Bosco {{is in love with}} her. In order to force her sister to leave, Ángela {{approaches}} Bosco and passionately kisses him. The next day, Ángela informs <b>Chema</b> that they need to see the police. Although first reluctant, <b>Chema</b> agrees, and tells Ángela he must take a shower before going. While <b>Chema</b> is in the bathroom, Angela finds an XT-500 camera among Chema's things. The tape inside the camera reveals footage taken of Ángela from outside her bedroom window. Convinced that <b>Chema</b> was stalking her, Ángela flees. She goes back home to advise her sister to remain safe. Afterwards, she takes a taxi to Bosco's house, followed by a figure in a black rain coat.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{describes the}} problematics of snow load measuring. At first, sensors' principles of functionality for indirect measurements are mentioned. In the second part, the problematics of direct measurement with tensiometer takes place. The construction of wireless apparatus {{with the help}} of module ZigBit for the snow load measurement is the result of this work. Sensor board is designed in Eagle software, obeying standards for machine vacuum pickup and fabrication. The apparatus works in two modes. During indirect measuring, additional processing of data is necessary. In this mode, the sensor board has very low energy consuption and therefore long service life also after a battery connection. In the second mode, the apparatus is automatically sending data about actual snow load of particular roof. The whole machine communicates {{with the help of}} ZigBit module and ZigBee protocol IEEE 802. 15. 4. The communication distance between sensorial points is allowed up to 100 m. At last but not at least, tensiometer UTILCELL M 230 measurements are attached. In attachments, <b>chemas</b> and printed circuit boards are presented, too. Except documentation, the CD contains also libraries for components and details for DPS machine production in Eagle Software...|$|R
40|$|With physics {{education}} in crisis in Australia and elsewhere as student numbers continue to trend downwards (Smithers & Robinson, 2006), {{this research is}} timely as it investigated a ‘smarter’ way to teach physics. Theory and practice were blended to develop the Tablet/Workbook Pedagogy (TWP). Its use in teaching high school physics classes produced clear evidence of improved scores in, understanding of, and engagement with physics. It is anticipated that use of the TWP will ultimately attract and etain more students in physics classes. Cognitive Load Theory, (CLT) (Sweller, 1994) provides a basis for understanding why physics is so difficult for many students o learn (Osborne, 2005), particularly when traditional methods are used (Paas, 1992). CLT views learning as the generation, elaboration and automation of mental <b>chemas</b> for storage in long term memory. The process of schema construction occurs in working memory which can cope with the simultaneous processing of only a very imited numbers (two to four) of chunks of complex information (Cowan, 2001). In an inherently complex subject like physics (van Merriënboer & Sweller, 2005), learning an occur only after multiple interacting elements have been simultaneously processed in working memory. For many students, particularly novices, learning is severely estricted when their limited working memory resources are overwhelmed by the required processing task and cognitive overload results.
