40|$|Abstract. Recently, it {{has been}} {{observed}} that the crack along the interface of non-homogeneous materials propagates exceeding transonic of the <b>compliant</b> <b>material.</b> This range of crack velocity is not possible to achieve in a homogeneous material. In our previous studies, the transonic interfacial fracture phenomena in bimaterial specimens of PMMA and aluminum alloy were experimentally recorded by using an ultrahigh-speed video camera. And the histories of the stress gradient distributions near the interface were also observed by the C. G. S method. In the experiment, it was observed that two cracks along the material interface coalesced and after that circular stress wave propagations occurred into the <b>compliant</b> <b>material</b> side. In this study, dynamic interfacial crack propagation is simulated by the moving finite element method based on the Delaunay automatic mesh generation, which accurately satisfy the boundary conditions in front of and behind the propagating crack tip. In the numerical simulation, the stress gradient waves occurred with the crack coalescence are successfully visualized in 3 -D form. Furthermore, it succeeded in calculating efficiently the separated dynamic J integration value in case two or more cracks coalescence by using s-function, and it will be found that the dynamic J integral is non-zero even for transonic fracture region and the most of the energy release rate is provided from the more <b>compliant</b> <b>material</b> PMMA...|$|E
40|$|Theory {{indicates}} that compliant materials {{are able to}} reduce the frictional drag of a marine body by delaying the transition from laminar to turbulent flow. Recent experimentation on relatively small samples of <b>compliant</b> <b>material</b> suggest that correctly designed compliant materials are able to damp instabilities in the boundary layer and delay transition. In this research the challenge was to design a device {{that could be used}} to test relatively large panels of complaint material and subsequently use the device to make an experimental comparison between the drag of complaint material and a standard non-compliant surface. In particular, the principal requirement of the test device was that laminar flow persisted over the leading edge and was incident on the <b>compliant</b> <b>material</b> surface over the desired test speed range. A drag-plate with a laminar flow nose section was designed for this purpose. In the first part of this thesis basic drag assessments are made using engineering formulae followed by a rigorous computational assessment of fluid flow, boundary layer properties and transition prediction for alternative laminar flow drag-plates. An optimum geometry is established for the laminar flow nose and other practical design requirements are assessed, resulting in the final design of the laminar flow drag-plate. In addition a suitable dynamometer with associated fixtures is designed. In the second part of this thesis, the experimental facility is characterised and experimental procedures established. The drag of a <b>compliant</b> <b>material</b> is compared to a standard non-compliant material. No drag reduction was evident, although the <b>compliant</b> <b>material</b> (supplied from an external source) had inconsistencies in manufacture. A number of different demonstrations of the laminar flow performance of the drag-plate are presented. These include a novel practical transition detection method and flow visualisation. It is demonstrated that the design challenge of producing a laminar flow device has been achieved despite the fact that the drag-plate exhibits a degree of roughening over the experimental period.

40|$|Material {{contrasts}} across faults are {{a common}} occurrence, {{and it is important}} to understand if these material contrasts can influence the path of rupture propagation. Here we examine models, solved numerically, of rupture propagation through one type of geometric complexity, that of a fault branch stemming from a planar main fault on which rupture initiates. This geometry, with a material contrast across the main fault, could be representative of either a mature strike-slip fault or a subduction zone interface. We consider branches in both the compressional and extensional quadrants of the fault, and material configurations in which the branch fault is in either the stiffer or the more <b>compliant</b> <b>material</b> and configurations with no material contrast. We find that there are regimes in which this elastic contrast can influence the rupture behavior at a branching junction, but there are also stress states for which the branch activation will not depend on the orientation of the mismatch. For the scenarios presented here, both compressional and extensional side branches are more likely to rupture if the branch is on the side of the fault with the more <b>compliant</b> <b>material</b> versus the stiffer material. The stresses induced on the branch fault, by rupture traveling on the main fault, are different for the two orientations of material contrast. We show how the interactions between rupture on the two faults determine which faults are activated. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Hydrogels {{are very}} <b>compliant</b> <b>materials</b> {{suitable}} for tissue engineering in various areas of biological and clinical research. Appropriate and effective application of hydrogels for specific cellular regeneration often requires precise {{knowledge of their}} mechanical properties. The present work focuses on measurements of mechanical deformation and creep properties of polyacrylamide hydrogels using a novel indentation system. Four concentrations of polyacrylamide gel were tested under four different loading rates to study the mechanical response of the material to various loading rates. A spherical indenter with large radius {{was used in the}} experiments and all indentations were done with the sample completely immersed in water. The results show that higher acrylamide concentration in the gel leads to higher elastic modulus and decrease of creep. Similarly, faster loading rates lead to higher elastic modulus and larger creep during the hold period. The data were analyzed using both Hertzian fit to the loading part and Oliver-Pharr approach to the unloading part. The discrepancy between these two approaches and significant creep behavior are related to the viscoelasticity of the tested materials. This work contributes to understanding the results of instrumented indentation of extremely <b>compliant</b> <b>materials</b> with respect to their viscoelastic properties...|$|R

30|$|One {{possible}} solution {{to these problems}} {{is the use of}} more <b>compliant</b> <b>materials</b> that allow loads to be distributed more physiologically over the periprosthetic bone. Although the effects of a more <b>compliant</b> implant <b>material</b> have hardly been studied, a small number of studies can be found in which the conventional metal-on-polymer was replaced with a polymer-on-polymer design (Bradley et al. 1993; Moore et al. 1998). Both studies describe the use of a polyacetal (Delrin®) femoral implant against polyethylene. During those studies the implants did not show signs of failure through fracture or wear after a minimum follow-up period of 5  years. Nonetheless, the implant was discontinued due to a decreased survival of the proposed implant, as a consequence of infection caused by poor packaging (Bradley et al. 1993; Moore et al. 1998). Although hypothesized in the polyacetal implant study, none have investigated the effect of a low-stiffness implant on the bone stock.|$|R

40|$|Micro-motion devices may share {{a common}} {{architecture}} such {{that they have a}} main body of <b>compliant</b> <b>material</b> and some direct actuation elements (e. g., piezoelectric element). The shape of such a <b>compliant</b> <b>material</b> is designed with notches and holes on it, and in this way one portion of the material deforms significantly with respect to other portions of the material – a motion in the conventional sense of the rigid body mechanism. The devices of this kind are called compliant mechanisms. Computer tools for the kinematical and dynamic motion analysis of the compliant mechanism are not well-developed. In this thesis a study is presented towards a finite element approach to the motion analysis of compliant mechanisms. This approach makes it possible to compute the kinematical motion of the compliant mechanism within which the piezoelectric actuation element is embedded, as opposed to those existing approaches where the piezoelectric actuation element is either ignored or overly simplified. Further, the developed approach allows computing the global stiffness and the natural frequency of the compliant mechanism. This thesis also presents a prototype compliant mechanism and a test bed for measuring various behaviors of the prototype mechanism. It is shown that the developed approach can improve the prediction of motions of the compliant mechanism with respect to the existing approaches based on a comparison of the measured result (on the prototype) and the simulated result. The approach to computation of the global stiffness and the natural frequency of the compliant mechanism is validated by comparing it with other known approaches for some simple mechanisms...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of <b>compliant</b> <b>materials</b> such as polymeric films and biological membranes {{that are of}} nanoscale in thickness are increasingly extracted from scanning probe microscope-enabled nanoindentation. These films are applied in various fields that require multiaxial loading conditions. The Hertzian contact models developed for linear elastic materials of semi-infinite thickness fail to accurately predict the elastic modulus E for these <b>compliant</b> <b>materials.</b> This makes it necessary to understand the evolution of stress and strain fields of these nanoscale structures. In this thesis we employ computational simulations {{that are based on}} experimental parameters for contact based analysis of compliant polymer thin films, to decouple the effect of thickness and angle of indentation on calculated {{mechanical properties}}. Traction applied by living cells to these compliant films are studied in detail. We thus identify the range of strains and material thickness for which contact models could be used to accurately predict the elastic stiffness of these polymeric films of nanoscale (< 100 nm) thickness using scanning probe microscope-enabled experiments, and the volumes over which adhered cells deform these films.
