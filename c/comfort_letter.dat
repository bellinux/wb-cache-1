2500|$|Before {{a company}} {{formally}} enters an insolvency procedure, three main rules regulate directors' behaviour to discourage running up unnecessary debts at creditors' expense. First, directors (whether real, de facto, or shadow directors) will commit a criminal offence if they dishonestly keep the company running to defraud creditors. [...] "Fraudulent trading" [...] under the Insolvency Act 1986 section 213, requires that a director is actually dishonest, under {{the standard of}} R v Ghosh: the director must have acted dishonestly by ordinary standards, and must have recognised that. The sum of money a director {{may have to pay}} for the offence is not in itself punitive, but rather compensates for the losses incurred in the period when she or he dishonestly kept the company running. In Morphites v Bernasconi Chadwick LJ decided it was not the intention of Parliament to enact a punitive element for damages under section 213 itself. Instead, under the Companies Act 2006 section 993, there is a separate specific offence of fraudulent trading, carrying a fine of up to £10,000. Beyond the directors, anyone who is knowingly party to the fraud will also be liable. Before someone can be an accessory to fraud, there must be an initial finding or allegation that a principal had acted wrongfully. So in Re Augustus Barnett & Son Ltd Hoffmann J struck out a liquidator's suit for fraudulent trading against the Spanish wine manufacturer, Rumasa SA, which was the parent of Barnett & Son, because although it had given a <b>comfort</b> <b>letter</b> for its subsidiary's debts, and although the subsidiary was advised that a fraudulent trading charge may arise, that had not actually been alleged yet.

50|$|Negative {{assurance}} {{comments are}} made on unaudited financial statements and subsequent changes, indicating that nothing came to the auditor's attention that suggests the statements do not comply with applicable accounting requirements; are not fairly presented in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis; or do not fairly present information shown therein. Negative assurance is given because the auditor has not made an examination in conformity with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS). Negative assurance is not appropriate unless the CPA has made an examination in accordance with GAAS for the accounting period before the current one. This is because the auditor needs evidence that {{can be related to}} <b>comfort</b> <b>letter</b> procedures. For negative assurance to be permissible, the evidence must have been gathered directly by the CPA giving the assurance, and not by another CPA.|$|E

40|$|This Article {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} unintended contractual liability that might be created {{by the use of}} informal 2 ̆ 2 comfort letters 2 ̆ 2 in international transactions. It first examines the presumption of enforceability placed on certain types of business correspondence by different foreign legal systems. It concludes that civil law systems are more likely to impose contractual liability for comfort instruments than the Anglo-American legal system, but that there are no per se rules of enforceability. The Article then examines the recently ratified Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) as a possible international resolution of these different approaches to the question of <b>comfort</b> <b>letter</b> enforceability. Grounded in a range of contract law systems, the CISG recognizes general principles of contract law as well as new contractual informalities. The CISG thus presents courts with a range of considerations that {{can be applied to the}} issue of <b>comfort</b> <b>letter</b> enforceability. While courts have yet to rule on <b>comfort</b> <b>letter</b> enforceability under the CISG, the Article suggests that American business people should familiarize themselves with the principles of the CISG to avoid potential unintended liability...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, banks {{throughout}} the world have found {{it increasingly difficult to}} obtain outright guarantees from companies to cover loan or other financial facilities to subsidiaries. Consequently, various third party credit support devices or comfort instruments, generally known as letters of comfort, have developed to provide an alternative to traditional forms of security. It is necessary for a proper understanding of these instruments to investigate their origin, to delineate them, and to consider their use in corporate group and banking practice. The typical <b>comfort</b> <b>letter</b> transaction involves the parent&# 8208;subsidiary&# 8208;lender trinity and at least three different, but inter&# 8208;related relationships which may be regulated by different legal regimes &# 150; first, between a lender and the subsidiary; secondly, between a lender and the parent company; and thirdly, between the parent company and the subsidiary. When the relationship between a lender and the subsidiary breaks down or the latter becomes insolvent, the courts are usually asked to determine the contractual effect of the letter of comfort as between the lender and the parent company. Letters of comfort are predominantly used in international business transactions. The issue of <b>comfort</b> <b>letter</b> enforceability is considerably more complex within an international context than in one&# 146;s own legal system. Courts in different jurisdictions and in disparate legal systems have adopted distinct approaches to determine the contractual enforceability of letters of comfort. Accordingly, a trans&# 8208;systemic view of the contractual effect of letters of comfort is necessary {{to be aware of the}} way in which such letters are treated in other legal systems, and to facilitate a consistent treatment of an instrument of international use in one&# 146;s domestic law. Over the years, letters of comfort have become more detailed in content. The result is more litigation about the enforceability of letters of comfort and, because of courts undertaking more contractual analysis of such letters, a doctrinal foundation for the assessment of liability against a parent company has started to be developed by courts in some jurisdictions. Legal liability based on a letter of comfort is a real possibility. Like a boomerang, a letter of comfort is potentially a dangerous instrument when it returns to its unsuspecting originator...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, in the German {{language}} area, the resale or end-sale price {{charged for}} new books in bookstores {{to the end}} customer has been a fixed or list price, observance of the list being enforced by the German Book Traders'' Association (Boersenverein des deutschen Buchhandels). The association operates a complex system of rules governing book fairs, registration of copy rights, dispute resolution in the publishing industry, communication between authors, publishers, the book trade and the general public, training and continuous education {{of the more than}} 22, 000 licensed booksellers and many others.
