5|$|Like all rare-earth metals, <b>cerium</b> is of low to {{moderate}} toxicity. A strong reducing agent, it ignites spontaneously in air at 65 to 80°C. Fumes from <b>cerium</b> fires are toxic. Water {{should not be}} used to stop <b>cerium</b> fires, as <b>cerium</b> reacts with water to produce hydrogen gas. Workers exposed to <b>cerium</b> have experienced itching, sensitivity to heat, and skin lesions. <b>Cerium</b> is not toxic when eaten, but animals injected with large doses of <b>cerium</b> have died due to cardiovascular collapse. <b>Cerium</b> is more dangerous to aquatic organisms, on account of being damaging to cell membranes, but this is not an important risk because it is not very soluble in water.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cerium</b> has {{no known}} {{biological}} role in humans, {{but is not}} very toxic either; it does not accumulate in the food chain to any appreciable extent. Because it often occurs together with calcium in phosphate minerals, and bones are primarily calcium phosphate, <b>cerium</b> can accumulate in bones in small amounts that are not considered dangerous. <b>Cerium,</b> like the other lanthanides, is known to affect human metabolism, lowering cholesterol levels, blood pressure, appetite, and risk of blood coagulation. <b>Cerium</b> nitrate is an effective topical antimicrobial treatment for third-degree burns, although large doses can lead to <b>cerium</b> poisoning and methemoglobinemia. The early lanthanides act as essential cofactors for the methanol dehydrogenase of the methanotrophic bacterium Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV, for which lanthanum, <b>cerium,</b> praseodymium, and neodymium alone are about equally effective.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cerium</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ce and atomic number 58. <b>Cerium</b> is a soft, ductile and silvery-white metal that tarnishes {{when exposed to}} air, and it is soft enough to be cut with a knife. <b>Cerium</b> is the second element in the lanthanide series, and while it often shows the +3 oxidation state characteristic of the series, it also exceptionally has a stable +4 state that does not oxidize water. It is also traditionally {{considered one of the}} rare-earth elements. <b>Cerium</b> has no biological role and is not very toxic.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cerium</b> oxide (or ceria) as an {{alloying}} element improves arc stability {{and ease of}} starting while decreasing burn-off. <b>Cerium</b> addition is not as effective as thorium but works well, and <b>cerium</b> is not radioactive.|$|E
5|$|The {{photostability}} of pigments can {{be enhanced}} {{by the addition of}} <b>cerium.</b> It provides pigments with light fastness and prevents clear polymers from darkening in sunlight. Television glass plates are subject to electron bombardment, which tends to darken them by creation of F-center color centers. This effect is suppressed by addition of <b>cerium</b> oxide. <b>Cerium</b> is also an essential component of phosphors used in TV screens and fluorescent lamps. <b>Cerium</b> sulfide forms a red pigment that stays stable up to 350°C. The pigment is a nontoxic alternative to cadmium sulfide pigments.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cerium</b> was {{the first}} of the {{lanthanides}} to be discovered, in Bastnäs, Sweden by Jöns Jakob Berzelius and Wilhelm Hisinger in 1803, and independently by Martin Heinrich Klaproth in Germany. It was first isolated by Carl Gustaf Mosander in 1839. Today, <b>cerium</b> and its compounds have a variety of uses: for example, cerium(IV) oxide is used to polish glass and is an important part of catalytic converters. <b>Cerium</b> metal is used in ferrocerium lighters for its pyrophoric properties.|$|E
5|$|An alloy of {{lanthanum}} oxide (or lanthana) {{has a similar}} effect as <b>cerium,</b> and is also not radioactive.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cerium</b> {{is used as}} a {{chemical}} simulant of plutonium for development of containment, extraction, and other technologies.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cerium</b> was {{discovered}} in Bastnäs in Sweden by Jöns Jakob Berzelius and Wilhelm Hisinger, and independently in Germany by Martin Heinrich Klaproth, both in 1803. <b>Cerium</b> was named by Berzelius after the dwarf planet Ceres, discovered two years earlier. The dwarf planet itself is named after the Roman goddess of agriculture, grain crops, fertility and motherly relationships, Ceres.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table published by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, thorium and the rare-earth elements were placed outside {{the main body of}} the table, at the end of each vertical period after the alkaline earth metals. This reflected the belief at that time that thorium and the rare-earth metals were divalent. With the later recognition that the rare earths were mostly trivalent and thorium was tetravalent, Mendeleev moved <b>cerium</b> and thorium to group IV in 1871, which contained the modern carbon group (group 14), titanium group (group 4), <b>cerium,</b> and thorium, because their maximum oxidation state was +4. <b>Cerium</b> was soon removed from {{the main body of the}} table and placed in a separate lanthanide series; thorium was left with group 4 as it had similar properties to its supposed lighter congeners in that group, such as titanium and zirconium.|$|E
5|$|A more {{detailed}} procedure adopted at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory was as follows: the initial mixture of actinides is processed with ion exchange using lithium chloride reagent, then precipitated as hydroxides, filtered and dissolved in nitric acid. It is then treated with high-pressure elution from cation exchange resins, and the berkelium phase is oxidized and extracted {{using one of}} the procedures described above. Reduction of the thus-obtained berkelium(IV) to the +3 oxidation state yields a solution, which is nearly free from other actinides (but contains <b>cerium).</b> Berkelium and <b>cerium</b> are then separated with another round of ion-exchange treatment.|$|E
5|$|All other <b>cerium</b> {{isotopes}} are synthetic and radioactive. The {{most stable}} {{of them are}} 144Ce with a half-life of 284.9days, 139Ce with a half-life of 137.6days, 143Ce with a half-life of 33.04days, and 141Ce with a half-life of 32.5days. All other radioactive <b>cerium</b> isotopes have half-lives under four days, {{and most of them}} have half-lives under ten minutes. The isotopes between 140Ce and 144Ce inclusive occur as fission products of uranium. The primary decay mode of the isotopes lighter than 140Ce is inverse beta decay or electron capture to isotopes of lanthanum, while that of the heavier isotopes is beta decay to isotopes of praseodymium.|$|E
5|$|Bastnäsite, LnIIICO3F, {{is usually}} lacking in thorium {{and the heavy}} {{lanthanides}} beyond samarium and europium, and hence the extraction of <b>cerium</b> from it is quite direct. First, the bastnäsite is purified, using dilute hydrochloric acid to remove calcium carbonate impurities. The ore is then roasted {{in the air to}} oxidize it to the lanthanide oxides: while most of the lanthanides will be oxidized to the sesquioxides Ln2O3, <b>cerium</b> will be oxidized to the dioxide CeO2. This is insoluble in water and can be leached out with 0.5M hydrochloric acid, leaving the other lanthanides behind.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1942, {{along with}} uranium {{production}} operations, the Ames Project conducted {{a variety of}} metallurgical research related to the separation and purification of thorium, beryllium and rare-earth metals, such as <b>cerium.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Cerium</b> has a {{variable}} electronic structure. The {{energy of the}} 4f electron is nearly {{the same as that}} of the outer 5d and 6s electrons that are delocalized in the metallic state, and only a small amount of energy is required to change the relative occupancy of these electronic levels. This gives rise to dual valence states. For example, a volume change of about 10% occurs when <b>cerium</b> is subjected to high pressures or low temperatures. It appears that the valence changes from about 3 to 4 when it is cooled or compressed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cerium</b> is {{the second}} element of the {{lanthanide}} series. In the periodic table, it appears between the lanthanides lanthanum to its left and praseodymium to its right, and above the actinide thorium. It is a ductile metal with a hardness {{similar to that of}} silver. Its 58 electrons are arranged in the configuration 4f15d16s2, of which the four outer electrons are valence electrons. Immediately after lanthanum, the 4f orbitals suddenly contract and are lowered in energy {{to the point that they}} participate readily in chemical reactions; however, this effect is not yet strong enough at <b>cerium</b> and thus the 5d subshell is still occupied. Most lanthanides can use only three electrons as valence electrons, as afterwards the remaining 4f electrons are too strongly bound: <b>cerium</b> is an exception because of the stability of the empty f-shell in Ce4+ and the fact that it comes very early in the lanthanide series, where the nuclear charge is still low enough until neodymium to allow the removal of the fourth valence electron.|$|E
5|$|Praseodymium is {{the third}} member of the {{lanthanide}} series. In the periodic table, it appears between the lanthanides <b>cerium</b> to its left and neodymium to its right, and above the actinide protactinium. It is a ductile metal with a hardness {{comparable to that of}} silver. Its 59 electrons are arranged in the configuration 4f36s2; theoretically, all five outer electrons can act as valence electrons, but the use of all five requires extreme conditions and normally, praseodymium only gives up three or sometimes four electrons in its compounds. Praseodymium is the first of the lanthanides to have an electron configuration conforming to the Aufbau principle, which predicts the 4f orbitals to have a lower energy level than the 5d orbitals; this does not hold for lanthanum and <b>cerium,</b> because the sudden contraction of the 4f orbitals does not happen until after lanthanum, and is not strong enough at <b>cerium</b> to avoid occupying the 5d subshell. Nevertheless, solid praseodymium takes on the 4f25d16s2 configuration, with one electron in the 5d subshell like all the other trivalent lanthanides (all but europium and ytterbium, which are divalent in the metallic state).|$|E
5|$|This may {{be reduced}} to cerium(III) oxide with {{hydrogen}} gas. <b>Cerium</b> metal is highly pyrophoric, meaning that when it is ground or scratched, the resulting shavings catch fire. This reactivity conforms to periodic trends, since <b>cerium</b> {{is one of the}} first and hence one of the largest lanthanides. Cerium(IV) oxide has the fluorite structure, similarly to the dioxides of praseodymium and terbium. Many nonstoichiometric chalcogenides are also known, along with the trivalent Ce2Z3 (Z = S, Se, Te). The monochalcogenides CeZ conduct electricity and would better be formulated as Ce3+Z2−e−. While CeZ2 are known, they are polychalcogenides with cerium(III): cerium(IV) chalcogenides remain unknown.|$|E
5|$|All other {{praseodymium}} isotopes have half-lives under a day (and most under a minute), {{with the}} single exception of 143Pr with a half-life of 13.6days. Both 143Pr and 141Pr occur as fission products of uranium. The primary decay mode of isotopes lighter than 141Pr is inverse beta decay or electron capture to isotopes of <b>cerium,</b> while that of heavier isotopes is beta decay to isotopes of neodymium.|$|E
5|$|Cerium(IV) aqueous {{solutions}} may {{be prepared}} by reacting cerium(III) solutions {{with the strong}} oxidising agents peroxodisulfate or bismuthate. The value of E⦵(Ce4+/Ce3+) varies widely depending on conditions due to the relative ease of complexation and hydrolysis with various anions, though +1.72V is a usually representative value; that for E⦵(Ce3+/Ce) is −2.34V. <b>Cerium</b> is the only lanthanide which has important aqueous and coordination chemistry in the +4 oxidation state. Due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer, aqueous cerium(IV) ions are orange-yellow. Aqueous cerium(IV) is metastable in water and is a strong oxidising agent that oxidizes hydrochloric acid to give chlorine gas. For example, ceric ammonium nitrate is a common oxidising agent in organic chemistry, releasing organic ligands from metal carbonyls. In the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, <b>cerium</b> oscillates between the +4 and +3 oxidation states to catalyse the reaction. Cerium(IV) salts, especially cerium(IV) sulfate, are often used as standard reagents for volumetric analysis in cerimetric titrations.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum is an {{essential}} cofactor for the methanol dehydrogenase of the methanotrophic bacterium Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV, although the great chemical similarity of the lanthanides means {{that it may be}} substituted with <b>cerium,</b> praseodymium, or neodymium without ill effects, and with the smaller samarium, europium, or gadolinium giving no side effects other than slower growth.|$|E
5|$|The tetrafluoride, PrF4, is also known, and is {{produced}} by reacting a mixture of sodium fluoride and praseodymium(III) fluoride with fluorine gas, producing Na2PrF6, following which sodium fluoride {{is removed from the}} reaction mixture with liquid hydrogen fluoride. Additionally, praseodymium forms a bronze diiodide; like the diiodides of lanthanum, <b>cerium,</b> and gadolinium, it is a praseodymium(III) electride compound.|$|E
5|$|Thorium {{can form}} alloys {{with many other}} metals. Addition of small {{proportions}} of thorium improves the mechanical strength of magnesium, and thorium-aluminium alloys have been considered {{as a way to}} store thorium in proposed future thorium nuclear reactors. Thorium forms eutectic mixtures with chromium and uranium, and it is completely miscible in both solid and liquid states with its lighter congener <b>cerium.</b>|$|E
5|$|A thorium atom has 90 electrons, {{of which}} four are valence electrons. Three atomic orbitals are {{theoretically}} {{available for the}} valence electrons to occupy: 5f, 6d, and 7s. Despite thorium's position in the f-block of the periodic table, it has an anomalous 6d27s2 electron configuration in the ground state, as the 5f and 6d subshells in the early actinides are very close in energy, {{even more so than}} the 4f and 5d subshells of the lanthanides: thorium's 6d subshells are lower in energy than its 5f subshells, because its 5f subshells are not well-shielded by the filled 6s and 6p subshells and are destabilised. Such unusual behaviour is due to relativistic effects, which become stronger {{near the bottom of the}} periodic table, specifically the relativistic spin–orbit interaction. The closeness in energy levels of the 5f, 6d, and 7s energy levels of thorium result in thorium almost always losing all four valence electrons and occurring in its highest possible oxidation state of +4. This is different from its lanthanide congener <b>cerium,</b> for which +4 is the highest possible state but +3 also plays an important role and is more stable. Thorium is much more similar to the transition metals zirconium and hafnium than to <b>cerium</b> in its properties such as ionisation energies and redox potentials, and hence also in its chemistry: this transition-metal-like behaviour is the norm in the first half of the actinide series.|$|E
5|$|Among the lanthanides, {{lanthanum}} is exceptional as it {{does not}} have any 4f electrons; indeed, the sudden contraction and lowering of energy of the 4f orbital that is important for the chemistry of the lanthanides only begins to happen at <b>cerium.</b> Thus it is only very weakly paramagnetic, unlike the strongly paramagnetic later lanthanides (with the exceptions of the last two, ytterbium and lutetium, where the 4f shell is completely full). Furthermore, since the melting points of the trivalent lanthanides are related to the extent of hybridisation of the 6s, 5d, and 4f electrons, lanthanum has the second-lowest (after <b>cerium)</b> melting point among all the lanthanides: 920°C. The lanthanides become harder as the series is traversed: as expected, lanthanum is a soft metal. Lanthanum has a relatively high resistivity of 615nΩm at room temperature; in comparison, the value for the good conductor aluminium is only 26.50nΩm. Lanthanum is the least volatile of the lanthanides. Like most of the lanthanides, lanthanum has a hexagonal crystal structure at room temperature. At 310°C, lanthanum changes to a face-centered cubic structure, and at 865°C, it changes to a body-centered cubic structure.|$|E
5|$|Berzelius {{made some}} initial characterisations {{of the new}} metal and its {{chemical}} compounds: he correctly determined that the thorium–oxygen mass ratio of thorium oxide was 7.5 (its actual value is close to that, ~7.3), but he assumed the new element was divalent rather than tetravalent, and so calculated that the atomic mass was 7.5 times that of oxygen (120 amu); it is actually 15 times as large. He determined that thorium was a very electropositive metal, ahead of <b>cerium</b> and behind zirconium in electropositivity. Metallic thorium was isolated {{for the first time}} in 1914 by Dutch entrepreneurs Dirk Lely Jr. and Lodewijk Hamburger.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{always being}} found in {{combination}} with the other rare-earth elements in minerals such as monazite and bastnäsite, <b>cerium</b> is easy to extract from its ores, as it can be distinguished among the lanthanides by its unique ability to be oxidized to the +4 state. It is the most common of the lanthanides, followed by neodymium, lanthanum, and praseodymium. It is the 26th most abundant element, making up 66ppm of the Earth's crust, half as much as chlorine and five times as much as lead.|$|E
5|$|The early {{lanthanides}} act {{as essential}} cofactors for the methanol dehydrogenase of the methanotrophic bacterium Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV, for which lanthanum, <b>cerium,</b> praseodymium, and neodymium alone are about equally effective. Praseodymium is otherwise {{not known to}} have a biological role in any other organisms, but is not very toxic either. Intravenous injection of rare earths into animals {{has been known to}} impair liver function, but the main side effects from inhalation of rare-earth oxides in humans come from radioactive thorium and uranium impurities.|$|E
5|$|The great {{rarity of}} the proton-rich 136Ce and 138Ce is {{explained}} by the fact that they cannot be made in the most common processes of stellar nucleosynthesis for elements beyond iron, the s-process (slow neutron capture) and the r-process (rapid neutron capture). This is so because they are bypassed by the reaction flow of the s-process, and the r-process nuclides are blocked from decaying to them by more neutron-rich stable nuclides. Such nuclei are called p-nuclei, and their origin is not yet well understood: some speculated mechanisms for their formation include proton capture as well as photodisintegration. 140Ce is the most common isotope of <b>cerium,</b> as it can be produced in both the s- and r-processes, while 142Ce can only be produced in the r-process. Another reason for the abundance of 140Ce is that it is a magic nucleus, having a closed neutron shell (it has 82 neutrons), and hence it has a very low cross-section towards further neutron capture. Although its proton number of 58 is not magic, it is granted additional stability, as its eight additional protons past the magic number 50 enter and complete the 1g7/2 proton orbital. The abundances of the <b>cerium</b> isotopes may differ very slightly in natural sources, because 138Ce and 140Ce are the daughters of the long-lived primordial radionuclides 138La and 144Nd, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} for monazite, which usually contains all the rare earths {{as well as}} thorium, is more involved. Monazite, because of its magnetic properties, can be separated by repeated electromagnetic separation. After separation, it is treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. The acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with sodium hydroxide to pH 3-4. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that, the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths to their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes {{one of the main}} components, <b>cerium,</b> whose oxide is insoluble in HNO3. Lanthanum is separated as a double salt with ammonium nitrate by crystallization. This salt is relatively less soluble than other rare earth double salts and therefore stays in the residue. Care must be taken when handling some of the residues as they contain 228Ra, the daughter of 232Th, which is a strong gamma emitter. Lanthanum is relatively easy to extract as it has only one neighbouring lanthanide, <b>cerium,</b> which can be removed by making use of its ability to be oxidised to the +4 state; thereafter, lanthanum may be separated out by the historical method of fractional crystallization of La(NO3)3·2NH4NO3·4H2O, or by ion-exchange techniques when higher purity is desired.|$|E
5|$|The {{solubility}} of <b>cerium</b> is {{much higher}} in methanesulfonic acid. Cerium(III) and terbium(III) have ultraviolet absorption bands of relatively high intensity compared with the other lanthanides, as their configurations (one electron more than an empty or half-filled f-subshell respectively) {{make it easier for}} the extra f electron to undergo f→d transitions instead of the forbidden f→f transitions of the other lanthanides. Cerium(III) sulfate is one of the few salts whose solubility in water decreases with rising temperature.|$|E
5|$|Thorium is a {{moderately}} hard, paramagnetic, bright silvery radioactive actinide metal. In the periodic table, it lies {{to the right}} of actinium, to the left of protactinium, and below <b>cerium.</b> Pure thorium is very ductile and, as normal for metals, can be cold-rolled, swaged, and drawn. At room temperature, thorium metal has a face-centred cubic crystal structure; it has two other forms at exotic conditions, one at high temperature (over 1360°C; body-centred cubic) and one at high pressure (around 100GPa; body-centred tetragonal).|$|E
5|$|Ytterbium is {{separated}} from other rare earths either by ion exchange or by reduction with sodium amalgam. In the latter method, a buffered acidic solution of trivalent rare earths is treated with molten sodium-mercury alloy, which reduces and dissolves Yb3+. The alloy is treated with hydrochloric acid. The metal is extracted from the solution as oxalate and converted to oxide by heating. The oxide is reduced to metal by heating with lanthanum, aluminium, <b>cerium</b> or zirconium in high vacuum. The metal is purified by sublimation and collected over a condensed plate.|$|E
5|$|Ceria is {{the most}} widely used {{compound}} of <b>cerium.</b> The main application of ceria is as a polishing compound, for example in chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP). In this application, ceria has replaced other metal oxides for the production of high-quality optical surfaces. Major automotive applications for the lower sesquioxide are as a catalytic converter for the oxidation of CO and NOx emissions in the exhaust gases from motor vehicles, Cerium(IV) sulfate is used as an oxidising agent in quantitative analysis. Cerium(IV) in methanesulfonic acid solutions is applied in industrial scale electrosynthesis as a recyclable oxidant. Ceric ammonium nitrate is used as an oxidant in organic chemistry and in etching electronic components, and as a primary standard for quantitative analysis.|$|E
5|$|Crushed {{minerals}} {{are treated}} with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths into their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes {{one of the main}} components, <b>cerium,</b> whose oxide is insoluble in HNO3. Several rare earth metals, including lutetium, are separated as a double salt with ammonium nitrate by crystallization. Lutetium is separated by ion exchange. In this process, rare-earth ions are sorbed onto suitable ion-exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or cupric ions present in the resin. Lutetium salts are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent. Lutetium metal is then obtained by reduction of anhydrous LuCl3 or LuF3 by either an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum is {{the first}} element and {{prototype}} of the lanthanide series. In the periodic table, it appears {{to the right of}} the alkaline earth metal barium and to the left of the lanthanide <b>cerium.</b> Lanthanum is often considered to be a group 3 element, along with its lighter congeners scandium and yttrium and its heavier congener, the radioactive actinium, although this classification is sometimes disputed. Similarly to scandium, yttrium, and actinium, the 57 electrons of a lanthanum atom are arranged in the configuration 5d16s2, with three valence electrons outside the noble gas core. In chemical reactions, lanthanum almost always gives up these three valence electrons from the 5d and 6s subshells to form the +3 oxidation state, achieving the stable configuration of the preceding noble gas xenon. Some lanthanum(II) compounds are also known, but they are much less stable.|$|E
