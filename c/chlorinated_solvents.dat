40|$|ABSTRACT: One of {{the main}} {{problems}} associated with remediation of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>solvent</b> groundwater contamination {{is the presence of}} NAPLs in the source zone. NAPLs are often better treated through solvent extraction, surfactant washing, or vapor extraction than through bioremediation. Removal of NAPL through solvent extraction would likely leave a substantial residual of both the extraction <b>solvent</b> and the <b>chlorinated</b> <b>solvent.</b> We hypothesized that utilization of the remaining extraction solvent as an electron donor could be exploited to clean up the remaining <b>chlorinated</b> <b>solvent</b> following source zone remediation. The main question is whether a suitable extraction solvent could work as an electron donor to drive reductive dechlorination. Many different compounds have been used as electron donors to stimulate reductive dechlorination, including volatile fatty acids (VFAs), sugars, hydrogen, and polymeric compounds. Generally, it is regarded that fermentation of compounds yields hydrogen, the true electron donor for reductive dechlorination. Compounds with high hydrogen yields generally are thought to be the best electron donors for bioremediation. After looking at several potential candidate solvents that might serve as electron donors for reductive dechlorination, we decided t...|$|R

This study addressed the following three knowledge gaps {{in the fields of}} <b>chlorinated</b> <b>solvent</b> and uranium bioremediation, 1) the risks and benefits of coupling bioremediation with thermal treatment for clean-up of chlorinated ethene-contaminated sites, 2) the accuracy of available techniques for the monitoring of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>solvent</b> bioremediation, and 3) the role of gram positive Desulfitobacterium spp. in uranium immobilization. Experiments demonstrated that thermal treatment increases electron donor availability, but the increased electron donor was not used to fuel reductive dechlorination and was actually consumed for methanogenesis. Two approaches for monitoring <b>chlorinated</b> <b>solvent</b> bioremediation were investigated, molecular techniques and compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA). Results demonstrated that while Dehalococcoides (Dhc) gene expression was up-regulated under conditions inhibitory to dechlorination, the isotope effects associated with dechlorination reactions catalayzed by Dhc populations in consortia and in pure cultures were similar. U(VI) reduction by multiple Desulfitobacterium isolates was demonstrated.

40|$|Remediation of <b>chlorinated</b> <b>solvent</b> DNAPL sites often {{meets with}} mixed results. This can be {{attributed}} to the diametrically opposed nature of the impacts, where the disparate dissolvedphase plume is more manageable than the localized, high-concentration source area. A wide range of technologies are available for downgradient plume management, but the relative mass of contaminants in a DNAPL source area generally requires treatment for such technologies to be effective over the long term. In many cases, the characteristics of DNAPL source zones (e. g., depth, soil heterogeneity, structural limitations) limit the available options. The following describes the successful full-scale implementation of in situ chemical reduction (ISCR) enhanced bioremediation of a TCE DNAPL source zone.
