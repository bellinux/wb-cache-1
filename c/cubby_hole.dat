5|$|Treloar {{returned}} to the AWM on 2September 1946 and was formally discharged from the Army in 1947. At the time he believed {{he was suffering from}} bad health, but wanted to resume his work at the Memorial rather than enter hospital. While Clarissa Treloar remained in Melbourne, their daughter Dawn moved to Canberra and took up a position in the Memorial's library. Treloar continued to work long hours in the years after the war. He lived in a <b>cubby</b> <b>hole</b> next to his office and signed the attendance book while walking from bed to his desk. Bean later claimed that Treloar had personally managed all areas of the Memorial other than its library. While Dawn provided him with company, family members and AWM staff believed that Treloar was lonely and did not have a social life. His letters to the official artists engaged by the AWM were frequently relaxed, however, and he became friends with Leslie Bowles and William Dargie. While Treloar was a teetotaler and non-smoker, he occasionally shared wine and cigarettes with Dargie.|$|E
2500|$|In this {{business}} I am {{very easy to}} <b>cubby</b> <b>hole.</b> As someone said to me the other day—they had seen the HBO special—and they said, [...] "Are you really a sad obsessed person?" [...] And I thought, No, I'm not really a sad person, except when I lie awake at night in winter thinking about all the animals out without shelter, and then I'm sad! Who wouldn't be? Wouldn't anybody be sad {{if they have a}} heart? It's just that I've seen so much.|$|E

50|$|Traditional Advent {{calendars}} {{feature the}} manger scene, Saint Nicholas and winter weather, while others range in theme, from sports to technology. They {{come in a}} multitude of forms, from a simple paper calendar with flaps covering each of the days to fabric pockets on a background scene to painted wooden boxes with <b>cubby</b> <b>holes</b> for small items.|$|R
50|$|The week {{of living}} in the {{basement}} began on January 30, 2005. On that same day, the sewer line in the house had burst, and the basement was flooded with several inches of sewage contaminated water. Pledges were forced to do push-ups and sit-ups in the sewage and sleep in small <b>cubby</b> <b>holes</b> that had been cut into the basement wall.|$|R
5000|$|The {{large windows}} in the {{classrooms}} are in the [...] "six-over-six" [...] style, with operable transoms above. The wooden front entry doors are original, and also surmounted by a semi-circular transom window (UK = fanlight). Brick pilasters are located {{at the corners of}} the building, and serve to accentuate the eave returns above. The building contains several brick chimneys with corbelling at the top. Character-defining elements include a wood-trimmed alcove containing coat hooks, <b>cubby</b> <b>holes,</b> and a storage closet. The well-preserved original slate chalkboards are still intact.|$|R

5000|$|... cwtch (a {{hiding place}} or <b>cubby</b> <b>hole)</b> is also from Welsh (albeit a recent word {{influenced}} by English), and crwth and cwtch are according to Collins the longest English dictionary words without A, E, I, O, U, or Y.|$|E
50|$|The {{method of}} {{operation}} was to anchor off the target beach, pointing towards the shore. The distance to the shore was then measured by radar and the elevation of the launchers set accordingly. The crew then vanished below (apart from the commanding officer who retreated to a special <b>cubby</b> <b>hole</b> to control things) and the launch was then set off electrically. The launch could comprise the entire set or individual ranks of rockets.|$|E
50|$|Several well-preserved {{interior}} {{structural elements}} {{contribute to the}} unique and historical character of the building. The original wood-trimmed alcoves — present in all four classrooms — contain coat hooks, <b>cubby</b> <b>holes,</b> and a storage closets. The original slate blackboards are intact, and text from {{the last day of}} classes in 1982 has been preserved. The floors in the original portion of the building are stained maple tongue-and-groove, and the floors in the 1930s-era classrooms are colored concrete. All of the original doors are intact, but much of the historic door furniture was replaced over the years. The plumbing fixtures within the boys’ restroom may be original, while the fixtures within the girls’ restroom are not.|$|R
50|$|Miss Cooling decides {{on a new}} filing system, for a more {{streamlined}} {{operation and}} job cards are put in <b>cubby</b> <b>holes</b> {{for each of the}} workers. Disaster strikes when the cleaner knocks the box down and puts the cards back all mixed up. Everyone gets someone else's assignment, with misunderstandings all round. Finally, the gobbledygook man turns up again and this time Francis is there to translate. He is their landlord and has been trying to inform Bert that he will have to vacate the premises, because he has had a better offer. Due to a show of unity by all the staff, the landlord agrees that they can stay, on the provision that they do something for him. His main interest is property development and he needs a house cleared and cleaned. Unfortunately the team end up demolishing the house but thankfully it turns out that it needed demolishing for a block of flats anyway, so all ends well.|$|R
5000|$|A typical {{corporate}} {{or university}} computer installation {{would have a}} suite of rooms, with a large, access-restricted, air conditioned room for the computer (similar to a modern server room) and a smaller adjacent room for submitting jobs. Nearby would be {{a room full of}} keypunch machines for programmer use. An IBM 407 Accounting Machine might be set up to allow newly created or edited programs to be listed (printed out on fan-fold paper) for proof reading. An IBM 519 might be provided to reproduce program decks for backup or to punch sequential numbers in columns 73-80. In such mainframe installations, known as closed shops, programmers submitted the program decks, often followed by data cards to be read by the program, to a person working behind a counter in the computer room. Many computer installations used cards with the opposite corner cut (sometimes no corner cut) as [...] "job separators", so that an operator could stack several job decks in the card reader {{at the same time and}} be able to quickly separate the decks manually when he removed them from the stacker. These cards (e.g., a JCL [...] "JOB" [...] card to start a new job) were often prepunched in large quantities in advance. This was especially useful when the main computer did not read the cards directly, but instead read their images from magnetic tape that was prepared offline by smaller computers such as the IBM 1401. After running a program, the computer operator would return the card deck and any hardcopy printed or punched output, typically to one of a set of alphabetically labelled <b>cubby</b> <b>holes,</b> based on the programmer's last initial. This was all batch-mode processing, as opposed to interactive processing.|$|R

5000|$|Every day we {{squeezed}} into our respective cubby holes {{with just enough}} room for a piano, a bench, and maybe a chair for the lyricist if you were lucky. You'd sit there and write and you could hear someone in the next <b>cubby</b> <b>hole</b> composing a song exactly like yours. The pressure in the Brill Building was really terrific—because Donny (Kirshner) would play one songwriter against another. He'd say: [...] "We need a new smash hit"—and we'd all go back and write a song {{and the next day}} we'd each audition for Bobby Vee's producer.

50|$|Second, Toyota {{learned about}} a {{loophole}} which Mercedes-Benz had exploited. All GT based cars {{were required to}} have storage space, capable of holding a standard sized suitcase, {{in order for the}} car to be considered not only production based, but usable by the public. Mercedes exploited this by putting a small <b>cubby</b> <b>hole</b> into an unused area underneath the rear bodywork, although it was not as easy to access as a normal trunk. Toyota, in their interpretation of the rules, were able to convince Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO) officials that the car's fuel tank, normally empty when the car is scrutineered before the race, was allowable as a trunk space since it could, theoretically, hold a suitcase.|$|E

5000|$|Down the Street was {{a popular}} nightclub in Asbury Park, New Jersey. It opened in 1988 by John Hitchcock who was {{previously}} manager/DJ at the ever so popular [...] "M&K". The club had much previous gay history. It was originally the [...] "dance" [...] part of Atlantis, the other part which was a hotel/ piano bar that burned very suspiciously one night after closing. It re-opened in the 1980s as [...] "Visions" [...] {{by one of the}} previous owners of [...] "Boots" [...] next door, Len but It had a short lived life as Visions. The club was one of the state's first gay discos. The name 'Down the Street' was used because it was located down the street from other popular gay clubs, Odyssey and M&K. It housed a dance floor, 5 bars, light shows, and drag |contests. It also had an outside area which included a volleyball court, food cart and another building which housed a quieter bar, The Clubhouse. The club even earned Asbury Park the nicknames [...] "Gay riveria on the East Coast" [...] and [...] "the budget Cherry Grove." [...] When Asbury Park declined in the 1980s, all of the other clubs in the city closed or were razed. However, Down the Street managed to stay open, making it the oldest and longest operating gay disco in New Jersey's history when it closed in 1999. John had moved to Florida with his partner Jay and opened a new and successful bar The <b>Cubby</b> <b>Hole.</b> John since sold that and has retired.|$|E
50|$|The final major {{upgrades}} to the Minor {{were made}} in 1962. Although the name Minor 1000 was retained, the changes were sufficient for the new model to be given its own ADO development number. A larger version of the existing A-Series engine had been developed in conjunction with cylinder head specialist Harry Weslake for the then new ADO16 Austin/Morris 1100 range. This new engine used a taller block than did the 948 cc unit, with increased bore and stroke bringing total capacity up to 1,098 cc. Although fuel consumption suffered moderately at 38 mpg, the Minor's top speed increased to 77 mph (124 km/h) with noticeable improvements in low-end torque, giving an altogether more responsive drive. The revised engine was teamed to a stronger gearbox fitted with baulk ring synchromesh rather than the old cone-clutch type. The brakes were still drums on each corner but the front units were increased from 8 inches (20 cm) to 9 inches (23 cm) in diameter. Other changes included a modified dashboard layout with toggle switches, textured steel instrument binnacle, {{and the return of}} a glove-box cover on the passengers side (the <b>cubby</b> <b>hole</b> on the driver's side remained open). A different heater completed the interior upgrade, whilst the larger combined front side/indicator light units, common to many BMC vehicles of the time, were fitted to the front wings. These now included a separate bulb and amber lens for indicators while larger tail lamp units also included amber rear flashers. The larger white-on-black speedometer unit (incorporating a warning light indicating when the oil filter was blocked) and the black plastic two-spoke steering wheel were both shared with the basic Morris 1100.|$|E
