5|$|Avadhi, {{which is}} a dialect of Hindi, is {{primarily}} from a region in Uttar Pradesh. It was chosen to give {{the feel of the}} language spoken during that era. However, the language was diluted, and modern viewers <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it.</b> The dialogues, which were a combination of three dialects (Avadhi, Bhojpuri and Braj Bhasha) were penned by Hindi writer K. P. Saxena.|$|E
25|$|One kabbalistic {{interpretation}} {{is that the}} Torah constitutes one long name of God, {{and that it was}} broken up into words so that human minds <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it.</b> While this is effective since it accords with our human reason, {{it is not the only}} way that the text can be broken up.|$|E
25|$|The West Germanic {{languages}} {{include the}} three most widely spoken Germanic languages: English with around 360–400 million native speakers; German, with over 100 million native speakers; and Dutch, with 23 million native speakers. Other West Germanic languages include Afrikaans, an offshoot of Dutch, with over 7.1 million native speakers; Low German, considered a separate collection of unstandardized dialects, with roughly 0.3 million native speakers and assuming 6.7—10 million people who <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it</b> (5 million in Germany and 1.7 million in the Netherlands); Yiddish, once used by approximately 13 million Jews in pre-World War II Europe and Scots, both with 1.5 million native speakers; Limburgish varieties with roughly 1.3 million speakers along the Dutch–Belgian–German border; and the Frisian languages with over 0.5 million native speakers in the Netherlands and Germany.|$|E

As for myself,--for mamma and me,--you <b>can</b> hardly <b>understand</b> how <b>it</b> {{has been with us}} when we were young. You despise Mr. Thwaite,--because he is a tailor." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her visitor turned sharp round. [...] "You can?" [...] There was a {{light in}} his strong stare. [...] "You <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it's</b> spoiling her temper and making her come down on me? She behaves as if I were of no use to her at all!" ...|$|R

25|$|Realizing {{what the}} Dragon means, Henry leads {{everyone}} {{back to the}} fountain, where he proceeds to wish for his family to be brought back, encouraging Emma, Regina, Gold, and Violet to do the same. Suddenly, the crystal starts to pulsate. Henry then climbs a statue and convinces the citizens of New York City to help them return magic to the world. The portal opens in the Bethesda fountain, and Gold walks through it. Hook, Snow, David, Jekyll and Zelena appear {{in front of the}} others. Regina, Henry, Emma, and Violet see them in the Bethesda fountain as they reunited. Unfortunately, Henry is left saddened that the crowd believed that the rescue was simply an illusion; Emma consoles him, explaining that it's the only way they <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it.</b> She was much like them until his near-death experience forced her to believe in magic.|$|E
500|$|Brad Park and Frank Mahovlich {{also criticized}} the booing. According to Park: [...] "We get nothing — not a dime for this. Brother, I'm sick". Other players were more sanguine. Dryden didn't lash {{out at the}} fans. [...] "I'm disappointed, but I <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it.</b> The fans wanted us to do real good, and they're {{frustrated}} we didn't. I didn't think I deserved to be booed. Tretiak frustrated us, but I guess I didn't frustrate them enough." ...|$|E
2500|$|He has {{suffered}} from agoraphobia. He was unable to board a plane going to Australia to shoot [...] and dropped from the film as a result. McG told people he suffered from fear of flying despite the issue being persistent agoraphobia. [...] "It was easier {{to say it was}} a fear of flying because, while it might make me look weak, people <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it</b> and I don't have to say, 'Well, I'm kind of crazy,'" [...] he told Fast Company. His brother died of a cocaine overdose in 2007, which he says has kept him grounded and reminds him not to take life for granted.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, is it you, O'Connor?" [...] General Hill exclaimed. [...] "If {{they were}} those two battalions of yours, I <b>can</b> quite <b>understand</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was very}} sad," [...] said Mrs. Chudleigh. [...] "You have my {{thanks for the}} story. I <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> that <b>it</b> was painful to tell." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is so strange. Perhaps you <b>can</b> hardly <b>understand</b> <b>it.</b> I {{sometimes}} have a sensation {{as if it}} was almost unfeeling to walk here.' ...|$|R
2500|$|It is {{also written}} by Asser that Alfred {{did not learn}} to read until he {{was twelve years old}} or later, which is {{described}} as [...] "shameful negligence" [...] of his parents and tutors. Alfred was an excellent listener and had an incredible memory and he retained poetry and psalms very well. A story is told by Asser about how his mother held up a book of Saxon poetry to him and his brothers, and said; [...] "I shall give this book to whichever one of you can learn it the fastest." [...] After excitedly asking, [...] "Will you really give this book to the one of us who <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it</b> the soonest and recite it to you?" [...] Alfred then took it to his teacher, learned it, and recited it back to his mother.|$|E
2500|$|Wrong {{doctrine}} {{tends to}} result in evil fruit and Tomkinson expresses this with a remarkable extended metaphor. [...] "Like as to a man that goeth into his garden more {{for the love of}} the colour and beauty of an herb or flower than for its virtue or goodness; being thereunto enslaved either from his own fancy, or because of an ancient praise to that colour, is not to be reputed wise." [...] In other words, received opinion and tradition do not make for truth. Reason is solely a strategy for marshalling the facts to fit a settled opinion of one's own. In this, God's law counts for nothing but what it will fetch in the course of debate. He gives an example of such atheism as Dr More's Natural Cabala Dr More is reported as giving a remarkably Muggletonian description of God's features then saying that scripture only uses this language so that [...] "vulgar opinion" [...] <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it.</b> And learned people misunderstand it, warns Tomkinson.|$|E
6000|$|... "No. He's simply {{fallen in}} with what we've said. It's because he's so sweet and yielding, and can't bear to refuse. I <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it</b> perfectly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mrs. Morel; [...] "I <b>can</b> quite <b>understand</b> <b>it,</b> child. Take {{no notice}} of him. You {{ought to be}} ashamed, William, saying such things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, but I <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> how <b>it</b> {{would be}} to want to," [...] Janet said. [...] "Lise, I guess we're searching--both of us for {{something}} we'll never find." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Snub a man, you mean. Well, I wouldn't even snub Sir Orlando very much, if I were you; though I <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> that <b>it</b> {{might be}} both {{pleasant}} and easy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} you mean by its being all over, mamma," [...] said Camilla. [...] "As far as I <b>can</b> <b>understand,</b> <b>it</b> has never been begun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It did {{not sound}} like it," [...] Isobel said. [...] "I don't think you <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it,</b> Captain Forster; it must be terrible to be like that." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{weather is}} a thing that is beyond me altogether. I never <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it.</b> The {{barometer}} is useless: it is as misleading as the newspaper forecast.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pardon me," [...] said Redclyffe, [...] "I <b>can</b> {{perfectly}} <b>understand</b> <b>it.</b> An American, in {{his feelings}} towards England, {{has all the}} jealousy and exclusiveness of Englishmen themselves,--perhaps, indeed, a little exaggerated." ...|$|R
60|$|This {{is a great}} mystery! How <b>can</b> we <b>understand</b> <b>it?</b> How <b>can</b> we <b>understand</b> the Divine {{and eternal}} bond between Father and Son? But this at least we <b>can</b> <b>understand,</b> that loyalty and {{obedience}} are Divine virtues, part of the likeness of Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, and therefore divine graces, the gift of God's holy Spirit.|$|R
6000|$|Roberts: [...] "My dear sir, I know--I <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> how <b>it</b> seems offensive; but I {{can assure}} you that I had no intention--no--no--" [...] he falters, with an imploring glance at Campbell, who takes the word.|$|R
6000|$|... "Or Paul and Virginia?" [...] said Lily. [...] "But I believe I'll have Pilgrim's Progress. I never <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it,</b> but I rather {{think that}} makes it nicer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't as {{it should}} be, though you <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it.</b> I'll bet you a guinea that Sir Timothy Beeswax has to go out before the {{beginning}} of next Session." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Didn't you? Well, you <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it</b> now. You {{can take}} it from me that this young lady is mine, and you'll find it a very fine evening for a walk." ...|$|E
6000|$|He saw {{the smile}} in Nasmyth's eyes, {{and turned to}} Wheeler, who was from the State of Washington. [...] "It's a solid fact that you, at least, <b>can</b> <b>understand.</b> <b>It's</b> not so very long since your folks headed West across the Ohio, and it's open to anyone {{to see what you}} have done." [...] Then he flung his hand out towards the east. [...] "They fancy back yonder we're still in the leading-strings, and it doesn't seem to strike them that we're growing big and strong." ...|$|R
5000|$|Dave Davies spoke {{highly of}} [...] "Autumn Almanac" [...] in an {{interview}} with Yahoo!, saying, [...] "I was playing through 'Autumn Almanac' recently and it’s a phenomenal recording. You <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> why <b>it</b> has lasted so long." ...|$|R
60|$|Either, methinks, 'plays' {{should be}} 'play'd,' or 'and' {{should be changed}} to 'while.' I <b>can</b> {{certainly}} <b>understand</b> <b>it</b> as a parenthesis, an interadditive of scorn; {{but it does not}} sound to my ear as in Shakspeare's manner.|$|R
6000|$|... "Be {{a little}} more than usually tender with him. It makes one almost cry to see such a fellow hurt like that. I <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it,</b> though I never had {{anything}} of it myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'O, I <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it.</b> All {{depends upon}} the temperament. Thousands of men would have {{forgotten}} all about it; so would you, perhaps, if you had married and had a family. Did she ever marry?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here is {{a letter}} which was brought me last night; no matter from whence; you <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>it</b> better than I, and I longed to have shown it you, but that I feared my son had become--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>can</b> quite <b>understand</b> <b>it,</b> mum," [...] had replied Amy; [...] "I dislike 'em myself. Only I {{heard you}} were in a hurry, and I thought maybe that while you were on the lookout for {{somebody}} permanent--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{best way}} {{would be to}} say nothing, and set {{somebody}} on to send 'em away with a flea in their ear, when they came spying and measuring," [...] said Solomon. [...] "Folks did that about Brassing, by what I <b>can</b> <b>understand.</b> <b>It's</b> all a pretence, if the truth was known, about their being forced to take one way. Let 'em go cutting in another parish. And I don't believe in any pay to make amends for bringing a lot of ruffians to trample your crops. Where's a company's pocket?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, not as lodgers; but {{of course}} you <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> that <b>it</b> is for me to pay for my own wife. I know I owe you an apology for {{mentioning}} it;--but how else could I make my request to you?" ...|$|R
