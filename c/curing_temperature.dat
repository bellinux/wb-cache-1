40|$|The {{critical}} thickness {{at which}} a toughness transition occurs in a polymer was determined for the Dow Corning 4 - 3136 silicone resin. 4 - 3136 is macroscopically brittle, but becomes up to ten times more ductile when it is processed {{in the form of}} a sufficiently thin film. Thickness was controlled for the thin films of amorphous polymer through solution composition variation. The films were spun on highly polished stainless steel at a constant angular velocity. The transition was observed over a range of film thicknesses at several different <b>curing</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Observation of cracking induced by bending and tensile strain was used as the gauge for the transition from brittle to ductile. The critical thickness was observed to have an unambiguous value at low <b>curing</b> <b>temperatures.</b> At higher <b>curing</b> <b>temperatures,</b> the transition occurred more gradually.

50|$|When the {{concrete}} is {{poured into the}} form, a small gap is created {{between it and the}} plastic. Plastic has a coefficient of thermal expansion and contraction 10 to 15 times that of concrete, and when subjected to temperature variations, the plastic continues to expand and contract at that higher coefficient. At high temperatures, plastic can even melt. The result is a separation between the spacers and the poured concrete, creating a free passage for corrosive agents to reach the steel reinforcement from the exterior of {{the concrete}} product. This will cause the steel - and eventually the concrete - to corrode. If steam curing is applied to the concrete, the heat in the curing process causes the plastic to expand while the concrete is relatively fresh and weak. After reaching the maximum <b>curing</b> <b>temperature</b> and volume expansion of the plastic, the temperature is held at this level until the concrete reaches the desired strength. After curing, the subsequent lower temperatures cause the plastic to contract, and a gap remains at the interface between the plastic and concrete. Plastic spacers are also subject to corrosion when they come into contact with chlorides and chemicals, where concrete has a much higher resistance.|$|E
50|$|The {{liquid-liquid}} and gas-liquid interface methods do have {{an issue}} where the nanoparticles can rotate in solution, causing the deposition of silver {{on more than one}} face. A liquid-liquid/liquid-solid hybrid interface method was first introduced by Granick et al. as a solution to this liquid-liquid method problem. In this method, molten paraffin wax was substituted for the oil, and silica nanoparticles for the magnetite. When the solution was cooled, the wax solidified, trapping half of each silica nanoparticle in the wax surface, leaving {{the other half of the}} silica exposed. The water was then filtered off and the wax-trapped silica nanoparticles were then exposed to a methanol solution containing (amino-propyl)triethoxysilane, which reacted with the exposed silica surfaces of the nanoparticles. The methanol solution was then filtered off and the wax was dissolved with chloroform, freeing the newly made Janus particles. Liu et al. reported the synthesis of acorn- and mushroom-shaped silica-aminopropyl-trimethoxysilane Janus nanoparticles using the hybrid liquid-liquid/liquid-solid method developed by Granick et al. They exposed homogenous aminopropyl-trimethoxysilane functionalized silica nanoparticles embedded in wax to an ammonium fluoride solution, which etched away the exposed surface. The liquid-liquid/liquid-solid hybrid method also has some drawbacks; when exposed to the second solvent for functionalization, some of the nanoparticles may be released from the wax, resulting in homogenous instead of Janus nanoparticles. This can partially be corrected by using waxes with higher melting points or performing functionalization at lower temperatures. However, these modifications still result in significant loss. Cui et al. designed a more enduring mask made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymer film to create a liquid-liquid/liquid-solid interface. The exposed-to-be-modified portion of particle surface can be adjusted by controlling the PDMS <b>curing</b> <b>temperature</b> and time, thus the embedment depth of the particles. The advantage of this fabrication method is that PDMS is inert and enduring in many wet chemistry solutions, and various metal or oxides or alloys such as silver, gold, nickel, titania can modify the exposed surface. Granick et al., in another paper, demonstrated a possible fix by using a liquid-liquid/gas-solid phase hybrid method by first immobilizing silica nanoparticles in paraffin wax using the previously discussed liquid-solid phase interface method, and then filtering off the water. The resulting immobilized nanoparticles were then exposed to silanol vapor produced by bubbling nitrogen or argon gas through liquid silanol, causing the formation of a hydrophilic face. The wax was then dissolved in chloroform, releasing the Janus nanoparticles.|$|E

One way to achieve this is with a kerfless structure based on 1 - 3 connectivity piezocomposite with the electrodes defined by photolithography.

The stacking sequence for all panels was [00 / 902 / 0] 4 s. Fourteen cure cycles were designed to study {{a wide range of}} <b>cure</b> pressures, <b>cure</b> <b>temperatures,</b> and two different vacuum-application durations, including vacuum vent at recommended pressure and vacuum hold throughout the cure cycle. It was found that for panels <b>cured</b> at different <b>temperatures</b> and for panels cured at different pressures with a vacuum vent at recommended pressure, SBS strength did not vary significantly over a relatively wide range of <b>cure</b> <b>temperatures</b> and pressures. However, after a certain point, a decreasing trend in the average SBS strength for both H/W and RT/D was observed by reducing the <b>cure</b> <b>temperature</b> as well as the cure pressure. Panels with the same cure pressure and dissimilar vacuum-application durations showed different SBS strength, with higher properties associated with panels in which the vacuum was vented at the recommended pressure. For panels cured at various cure pressures and the vacuum hold throughout the cure cycles, C-scan results showed a cross-shaped high-porosity {{in the middle of the}} panels, which became larger as the cure pressure decreased. This defect is believed to cause higher variability of the SBS strength as the cure pressure is reduced. SBS strength was found to decrease with increasing void content in the test specimens. Theoretical models were compared to the experimental data of SBS strength vs. void content.
