5000|$|The {{earliest}} form of {{a manual}} transmission {{is thought to have}} been invented by Joe Clulow and Émile Levassor in the late 19th century. This type of transmission offered multiple gear ratios and, in most cases, reverse. The gears were typically engaged by sliding them on their shafts (hence the phrase shifting gears), which required careful timing and throttle manipulation when shifting, so the gears would be spinning at roughly the same speed when engaged; otherwise, the teeth would refuse to mesh. These transmissions are called sliding mesh transmissions or sometimes <b>crash</b> <b>boxes,</b> because of the difficulty in changing gears and the loud grinding sound that often accompanied.

40|$|Aluminum {{closed-cell}} {{foam filled}} aluminum tubes with a polyester bonding layer between foam core and tube wall have been compression tested in ord er to detemiine specific energy absorption for the <b>crash</b> <b>box</b> applications. Aluminum foam, empty and foam filled tubes without bonding layer were also tested for comparison purposes, Preliminary results {{have shown that}} interaction effect {{has been found in}} foam filled tubes with polyester layer. In order to identify deforiDation mechanisms involving with tube deforination, deformed empty and foam filled tubes crosssections were microscopically analyzed and operative defoimationmechanisms were determined...|$|R
