25|$|A {{chloroplast}} {{is a type}} of e {{known as}} a plastid, characterized by its high concentration of chlorophyll. Other plastid types, such as the leucoplast and the <b>chromoplast,</b> contain little chlorophyll and do not carry out photosynthesis.|$|E
25|$|Plastid {{differentiation}} is not permanent, in fact many interconversions are possible. Chloroplasts may {{be converted}} to chromoplasts, which are pigment-filled plastids responsible for the bright colors seen in flowers and ripe fruit. Starch storing amyloplasts can also {{be converted to}} chromoplasts, {{and it is possible}} for proplastids to develop straight into chromoplasts. Chromoplasts and amyloplasts can also become chloroplasts, like what happens when a carrot or a potato is illuminated. If a plant is injured, or something else causes a plant cell to revert to a meristematic state, chloroplasts and other plastids can turn back into proplastids. Chloroplast, amyloplast, <b>chromoplast,</b> proplast, etc., are not absolute states—intermediate forms are common.|$|E

50|$|The presence, {{frequency}} and identification of substructures using an electron microscope {{has led to}} further classification, dividing <b>chromoplasts</b> into five main categories: Globular <b>chromoplasts,</b> crystalline <b>chromoplasts,</b> fibrillar <b>chromoplasts,</b> tubular <b>chromoplasts</b> and membranous <b>chromoplasts.</b> It has also been found that different types of <b>chromoplasts</b> can coexist in the same organ. Some examples of plants in the various categories include mangos, which have globular <b>chromoplasts,</b> and carrots which have crystalline <b>chromoplasts.</b> Although some <b>chromoplasts</b> are easily categorized, others have characteristics from multiple categories that make them hard to place. Tomatoes accumulate carotenoids, mainly lycopene crystalloids in membrane-shaped structures, which could place them in either the crystalline or membranous category.|$|R
50|$|<b>Chromoplasts</b> {{are found}} in fruits, flowers, roots, and {{stressed}} and aging leaves, and are responsible for their distinctive colors. This is always associated with a massive increase in the accumulation of carotenoid pigments. The conversion of chloroplasts to <b>chromoplasts</b> in ripening is a classic example.|$|R

50|$|A {{chloroplast}} {{is a type}} of organelle {{known as}} a plastid, characterized by its high concentration of chlorophyll. Other plastid types, such as the leucoplast and the <b>chromoplast,</b> contain little chlorophyll and do not carry out photosynthesis.|$|E
50|$|The {{entire process}} of <b>chromoplast</b> {{formation}} {{is not yet}} completely understood on the molecular level. However, electron microscopy has revealed part of the transformation from chloroplast to <b>chromoplast.</b> The transformation starts with remodeling of the internal membrane system with the lysis of the intergranal thylakoids and the grana. New membrane systems form in organized membrane complexes called thylakoid plexus. The new membranes are {{the site of the}} formation of carotenoid crystals. These newly synthesized membranes do not come from the thylakoids, but rather from vesicles generated from the inner membrane of the plastid. The most obvious biochemical change would be the downregulation of photosynthetic gene expression which results in the loss of chlorophyll and stops photosynthetic activity.|$|E
40|$|The {{differentiation}} of <b>chromoplasts</b> in the sepals of Physalis alkekengi was studied by light- and electron-microscopy and pigment analyses. The {{development of the}} <b>chromoplasts</b> from the chloroplasts started about four weeks after antítesis and, {{within the next two}} weeks resulted in the formation of small electron-transparent crystalloids connected to plastoglobules. Treatment of the sepals with norflurazon, which inhibits p-carotene accumulation, prevented the formation of the small crystalloids. Only numerous plastoglobules filled the <b>chromoplasts.</b> The results are discussed with regard to the already known action of some bleaching herbicides...|$|R
40|$|<b>Chromoplasts</b> are {{a common}} {{differentiation}} state of plastids in which the photosynthetic apparatus is absent and carotenoids accumulate to high levels. As {{a first step toward}} the isolation of chromoplast-specific genes, we have examined plastids of the bell pepper, Capsicum annuum L., for the presence of chromoplast-specific proteins. Intact <b>chromoplasts</b> were isolated from mature fruits of C. annuum var Emerald Giant, Golden Cal Wonder, and DNAP VS- 12 by differential centrifugation followed by isopycnic sedimentation in gradients of silica sols. The plastids were then fractionated into soluble and membrane components and the proteins analyzed by one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis using isoelectric focusing, sodium dodecyl sulfate, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea gels. Two polypeptides with Mr of 35, 000 and 58, 000 accumulate to high levels in membrane fractions of <b>chromoplasts</b> of var Emerald Giant. These polypeptides are either not detectable or barely detectable in chloroplasts from immature fruits. Both polypeptides have been purified to near homogeneity. Yellow <b>chromoplasts</b> from var Golden Cal Wonder and red <b>chromoplasts</b> from var DNAP VS- 12 contained the 35 -kilodalton polypeptide, but not the 58 -kilodalton species...|$|R
40|$|The fine structure, pigment {{content and}} protein profile of <b>chromoplasts</b> in fruit of Solatium capsicastrum were studied during the {{various stages of}} ripening. Plastid {{metamorphosis}} is synchronized with the disappearance of chlorophylls and intense synthesis of carotenoids. The chloro-chromoplasts observed in the first stages of fruit ripening accumulated large groups of plastoglobules. As the ripening process proceeded, the plastoglobules transformed into small crystalloids and tubules. In red ripe fruit the <b>chromoplasts</b> contained three carotenoid-bearing structures: plastoglobules, small crystalloids and tubules, Fruit treated with norfiurazon formed only numerous plastoglobules, whereas the other two structures were absent. The results are discussed with regard to previous results on the formation of specific <b>chromoplasts</b> structures...|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "chromoplast" [...] is {{occasionally}} used {{to include}} any plastid that has pigment, mostly {{to emphasize the}} difference {{between them and the}} various types of leucoplasts, plastids that have no pigments. In this sense, chloroplasts are a specific type of <b>chromoplast.</b> Still, [...] "chromoplast" [...] is more often used to denote plastids with pigments other than chlorophyll.|$|E
50|$|Wild {{tomatoes}} are small, green and largely unappetizing, but after centuries of breeding {{there are now}} thousands of varieties grown worldwide. Agrobacterium-mediated genetic engineering techniques were developed in the late 1980s that could successfully transfer genetic material into the nuclear genome of tomatoes. Genetic material can also be inserted into a tomato cell's chloroplast and <b>chromoplast</b> plastomes using biolistics. Tomatoes were the first food crop with an edible fruit where this was possible.|$|E
50|$|Using a light {{microscope}} chromoplasts can be differentiated and are classified into four main types. The first type {{is composed of}} proteic stroma with granules. The second is composed of protein crystals and amorphous pigment granules. The third type is composed of protein and pigment crystals. The fourth type is a <b>chromoplast</b> which only contains crystals. An electron microscope reveals even more, allowing for the identification of substructures such as globules, crystals, membranes, fibrils and tubules. The substructures found in chromoplasts are {{not found in the}} mature plastid that it divided from.|$|E
50|$|Carotenoid {{biosynthesis}} {{occurs in}} both <b>chromoplasts</b> and chloroplasts. In the <b>chromoplasts</b> of tomato flowers, carotenoid synthesis is {{regulated by the}} genes Psyl, Pds, Lcy-b, and Cyc-b. These genes, in addition to others, {{are responsible for the}} formation of carotenoids in organs and structures. For example, the Lcy-e gene is highly expressed in leaves, which results in the production of the carotenoid lutein.|$|R
50|$|Valencia oranges Citris sinensis L are a {{cultivated}} orange grown {{extensively in}} the state of Florida. In the winter, Valencia oranges reach their optimum orange-rind color while reverting to a green color in the spring and summer. While it was originally thought that <b>chromoplasts</b> were the final stage of plastid development, in 1966 it was proved that <b>chromoplasts</b> can revert to chloroplasts, which causes the oranges to turn back to green.|$|R

The investigations have given the following results: 1) During the transformation of chloroplasts into <b>chromoplasts</b> the photosynthetic activity ceases simultaneously with the disappearance of chlorophyll. 2) Fully developed <b>chromoplasts</b> never contain chlorophyll and never show any photosynthetic activity. 3) The regreening <b>chromoplasts</b> regain their photosynthetic activity simultaneously with the reappearance of chlorophyll. 4) The presence of chlorophyll and the existence of photosynthetic activity appear to be closely correlated with the appearance of grana...|$|R

50|$|Two {{separate}} {{strains of}} the virus - Severe Tulip Breaking Virus (STBV) and Mild Tulip Breaking Virus (MTBV) - have been determined by the type and severity of the symptoms they cause. In certain varieties STBV causes full breaking or light breaking, when {{due to a lack}} of anthocyanin, pigment present in the surface <b>chromoplast</b> cells fades and the lighter color (white or yellow) of the internal mesophyll is exposed, appearing as irregular streaks or fine featherings. In the same varieties MTBV causes self breaking or dark breaking, which occurs because anthocyanins are formed in excess, so the color in the epidermal cells is intensified in dark streaks or elongated flecks and sworls. Breaking commonly occurs along the edges and tops of petals and sepals. The most common type of breaking found in naturally infected plants, called average break, is caused by infection with a mixture of STBV and MTBV; both light breaking and dark breaking symptoms are present, together with some unbroken areas, in different parts of the same petal. Plants infected with a mixture of strains when young may exhibit both effects, with light breaking symptoms restricted to the basal part of the petal and severe dark breaking effects in the upper parts. Some varieties were later found to be incapable of light breaking, and always showed dark breaking symptoms no matter whether infected with STBV or MTBV or a mixture of both strains. Although they still can be infected, white and yellow flowered varieties are incapable of breaking since they lack anthocyanins; their color is determined by colourless or yellow plastids in the mesophyll. Other outward symptoms can include leaf mottling.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} approach, {{allowing us}} to understand the effect of natural structural barriers (cell walls, <b>chromoplast</b> substructures) on carotenoid bioaccessibility, was developed. Different fractions with different levels of carotenoid bio-encapsulation (carotenoid-enriched oil, chromoplasts, small cell clusters, and large cell clusters) were isolated from different types of carrots and tomatoes. An in vitro method {{was used to determine}} carotenoid bioaccessjbility. In the present work, a significant decrease in carotenoid in vitro bioaccessibility could be observed with an increasing level of bio-encapsulation. Differences in cell wall material and <b>chromoplast</b> substructure between matrices influenced carotenoid release and inclusion in micelles. For carrots, cell walls and <b>chromoplast</b> substructure were important barriers for carotenoid bioaccessibility while, in tomatoes, the <b>chromoplast</b> substructure represented the most important barrier governing bioaccessibility. The highest increase in carotenoid bioaccessibility, for all matrices, was obtained after transferring carotenoids into the oil phase, a system lacking cell walls and <b>chromoplast</b> substructures that could hamper carotenoid release...|$|E
50|$|<b>Chromoplasts</b> {{synthesize}} {{and store}} pigments such as orange carotene, yellow xanthophylls, {{and various other}} red pigments. As such, their color varies depending on what pigment they contain. The main evolutionary purpose of <b>chromoplasts</b> is probably to attract pollinators or eaters of colored fruits, which help disperse seeds. However, they are also found in roots such as carrots and sweet potatoes. They allow the accumulation of large quantities of water-insoluble compounds in otherwise watery parts of plants.|$|R
5000|$|They are {{generally}} found in mature tissues and {{are derived from}} preexisting mature plastids. Fruits and flowers {{are the most common}} structures for the biosynthesis of carotenoids, although other reactions occur there as well including the synthesis of sugars, starches, lipids, aromatic compounds, vitamins and hormones. [...] The DNA in chloroplasts and <b>chromoplasts</b> is identical. One subtle difference in DNA was found after a liquid chromatography analysis of tomato <b>chromoplasts</b> was conducted, revealing increased cytosine methylation.|$|R
40|$|A cytochemical {{method for}} the ultrastructural {{localization}} of glycolipids, performed on thin sections, {{was used in}} the study of tubular <b>chromoplasts.</b> The method gave clear pictures of structures that contained glycolipids, while other chemical constituents were not stained. The method was tested on two flowers (Impatients noli-tangere L. and Thunbergia alata Boj. ex Sims) containing different types of tubular <b>chromoplasts.</b> The ultrastructure and mode of development of the two types of tubules are discussed and compared with the results obtained by standard staining methods...|$|R
30|$|Proteins {{from the}} plant <b>chromoplast</b> are {{essential}} for many physiological processes such as fatty acid biosynthesis. Different protein extraction methods were tested {{to find the most}} robust method to obtain oil palm <b>chromoplast</b> proteins for mass spectrometry analysis. Initially, two different solvents were employed to reduce the fruit lipids. Then, two plant cell wall digestive enzymes were used to acquire the protoplasts to increase the protein extraction effectiveness. A two-stage centrifugation-based fractionation approach enhanced the number of identified proteins, particularly the fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes. The effectiveness of each extraction method was assessed using protein yields and 2 DE gel profiles. The ideal method was successfully used to establish the 2 DE <b>chromoplast</b> proteome maps of low and high oleic acid mesocarps of oil palm. Further nanoLC–MS/MS analysis of the extracted <b>chromoplast</b> proteins led to the identification of 162 proteins, including some of the main enzymes involved in the fatty acid biosynthesis. The established procedures would provide a solid foundation for further functional studies, including fatty acid biosynthetic expression profiling and evaluation of regulatory function.|$|E
40|$|Chromoplasts are carotenoid-accumulating {{plastids}} conferring {{color to}} many flowers and fruits {{as well as}} to some tubers and roots. <b>Chromoplast</b> differentiation proceeds from preexisting plastids, most often chloroplasts. One of the most prominent changes is remodeling of the internal membrane system associated with the formation of carotenoid-accumulating structures. During the differentiation process the plastid genome is essentially stable and transcriptional activity is restricted. The buildup of the <b>chromoplast</b> for specific metabolic characteristics is essentially dependent upon the transcriptional activity of the nucleus. Important {{progress has been made in}} terms of mediation of the chloroplast-to-chromoplast transition with the discovery of the crucial role of the Or gene. In this article we review recent developments in the structural, biochemical and molecular aspects of <b>chromoplast</b> differentiation and also consider the reverse differentiation of chromoplasts into chloroplast-like structures during the regreening process occurring in some fruit. Future perspectives toward a full understanding of <b>chromoplast</b> differentiation include in-depth knowledge of the changes occurring in the plastidial proteome during chromoplastogenesis, elucidation of the role of hormones and the search for signals that govern the dialog between the nuclear and the chromoplastic genome...|$|E
30|$|Following {{cell wall}} digestion, the {{predominantly}} <b>chromoplast</b> protein pellet was first obtained using differential centrifugation before further isolation with sucrose {{density gradient centrifugation}} (Barsan et al. 2010; Agrawal et al. 2010). The three clear interphases were retrieved and extracted proteins {{from each of the}} interphase were analyzed mass spectrometrically to assess the effectiveness of the strategy. As anticipated, the total number of identified proteins (25) and their peptides (78) increased almost fourfold to 93 proteins and 298 peptides using the two-stage isolation approach. Most importantly, nine fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes were identified, compared to only five using differential centrifugation alone. Conventionally, sucrose density gradient is applied to purify targeted organelle extract from other contaminant organelles co-extracted in the first isolation stage using differential centrifugation. However, in this study, the second isolation stage was intended to enhance the detection of fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes by fractionating the predominantly <b>chromoplast</b> suspension into three individual interphases. An overview of the identified proteins from whole mesocarp and <b>chromoplast</b> protein extracts showed that the combined interphases contained pre-dominantly <b>chromoplast</b> as it was not heavily cross-contaminated by other organelles. This was based on the non-detectable organelle protein markers (normally used as antibodies in Western blot analysis for degree of enrichment assessment) for mitochondria (cytochrome c oxidase) and endoplasmic reticulum (NADPH cytochrome c reductase) after the enrichment steps. However, cytosolic sucrose synthase one and peroxisome catalase two were identified, indicating possible cross-contamination by these organelles. Chloroplastic Rubisco large subunit were present in both whole mesocarp and <b>chromoplast</b> extracts (Additional file 1, Additional file 2). These markers were identified mass spectrometrically.|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} for the isolation and the purification of Capsicum annum L. var. Yolo Wonder <b>chromoplasts</b> is described. The {{degree of purity}} of the isolated <b>chromoplasts</b> is greatly improved {{by the absence of}} MgCl 2 in the extraction medium and in the gradient purification system, as shown by electron micrographs and the near absence of antimycin-insensitive NADH:cytochrome c reductase activity and succinate:cytochrome c reductase activity. Furthermore, phosphatidylserine was absent and the phosphatidylethanolamine content was reduced by a factor of 5 in these preparations, which were active in the synthesis of galactolipids, prenylquinones, and carotenoids...|$|R
50|$|The main {{evolutionary}} {{purpose of}} <b>chromoplasts</b> is to attract animals and insects to pollinate their flowers and disperse their seeds. The bright colors often produced by <b>chromoplasts</b> {{is one of}} many ways to achieve this. Many plants have evolved symbiotic relationships with a single pollinator. Color can be a very important factor in determining which pollinators visit a flower, as specific colors attract specific pollinators. White flowers tend to attract beetles, bees are most often attracted to violet and blue flowers, and butterflies are often attracted to warmer colors like yellows and oranges.|$|R
50|$|<b>Chromoplasts</b> are plastids, {{heterogeneous}} organelles {{responsible for}} pigment synthesis and storage in specific photosynthetic eukaryotes. It {{is thought that}} like all other plastids including chloroplasts and leucoplasts they are descended from symbiotic prokaryotes.|$|R
30|$|Proteins were {{extracted}} {{both from}} the <b>chromoplast</b> pellet and the interphases obtained by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Proteins from the <b>chromoplast</b> pellet were also {{used to evaluate the}} effectiveness of several solutions for protein extraction. 100  % phenol, phenol with sodium dodecyl sulfate (phenol/SDS), SDS alone, and TCA/acetone were used to extract the proteins (Rastegari et al. 2011; Rodrigues et al. 2012; Méchin et al. 2006; Yeung et al. 2008). Precipitation of the proteins after extraction was performed with either ammonium acetate/methanol or TCA/acetone.|$|E
40|$|Here, a {{comprehensive}} proteomic {{analysis of the}} chromoplasts purified from sweet orange using Nycodenz density gradient centrifugation is reported. A GeLC-MS/MS shotgun approach was used to identify the proteins of pooled <b>chromoplast</b> samples. A total of 493 proteins were identified from purified chromoplasts, of which 418 are putative plastid proteins based on in silico sequence homology and functional analyses. Based on the predicted functions of these identified plastid proteins, a large proportion (∼ 60 %) of the <b>chromoplast</b> proteome of sweet orange is constituted by proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid/protein synthesis, and secondary metabolism. Of note, HDS (hydroxymethylbutenyl 4 -diphosphate synthase), PAP (plastid-lipid-associated protein), and psHSPs (plastid small heat shock proteins) involved in the synthesis or storage of carotenoid and stress response {{are among the most}} abundant proteins identified. A comparison of <b>chromoplast</b> proteomes between sweet orange and tomato suggested a high level of conservation in a broad range of metabolic pathways. However, the citrus <b>chromoplast</b> was characterized by more extensive carotenoid synthesis, extensive amino acid synthesis without nitrogen assimilation, and evidence for lipid metabolism concerning jasmonic acid synthesis. In conclusion, this study provides an insight into the major metabolic pathways as well as some unique characteristics of the sweet orange chromoplasts at the whole proteome level...|$|E
40|$|The {{differentiation}} of chloroplasts to chromoplasts in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) corollas parallels flower development. <b>Chromoplast</b> biogenesis involves chlorophyll degradation, carotenoid accumulation, {{and the appearance}} of a new set of proteins. To study factors involved in <b>chromoplast</b> biogenesis in floral tissues, a minor (in abundance) protein of about 14 kD, CHRD (<b>chromoplast</b> protein D), was isolated from cucumber corolla chromoplasts. Immunological characterization revealed that the protein is chromoplast-specific and that its steady-state level in corollas increases in parallel to flower development. The protein was not detected in cucumber leaves or fruits. Immunological analysis of corollas and fruits from variety of other plants also did not reveal cross-reactivity with the CHRD protein antisera. Using an in vitro bud culture system, we analyzed the effect of phytohormones on CHRD expression. Gibberellic acid rapidly enhanced, whereas paclobutrazol down-regulated, the steady-state level of CHRD. Ethylene also down-regulated the protein's steady-state level. It is suggested that hormonal control of chromoplastogenesis is tightly regulated at the tissue/organ level and that mainly developmental signals control carotenoid accumulation in nonphotosynthetic tissues...|$|E
40|$|Plastoglobules (PGs) are oval or tubular lipid-rich {{structures}} {{present in}} all plastid types, but their specific functions are unclear. PGs contain quinones, α-tocopherol, and lipids and, in <b>chromoplasts,</b> carotenoids as well. It is not known whether PGs contain any enzymes or regulatory proteins. Here, we determined the proteome of PGs from chloroplasts of stressed and unstressed leaves of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) {{as well as from}} pepper (Capsicum annuum) fruit <b>chromoplasts</b> using mass spectrometry. Together, this showed that the proteome of chloroplast PGs consists of seven fibrillins, providing a protein coat and preventing coalescence of the PGs, and an additional 25 proteins likely involved in metabolism of isoprenoid-derived molecules (quinines and tocochromanols), lipids, and carotenoid cleavage. Four unknown ABC 1 kinases were identified, possibly involved in regulation of quinone monooxygenases. Most proteins have not been observed earlier but have predicted N-terminal chloroplast transit peptides and lack transmembrane domains, consistent with localization in the PG lipid monolayer particles. Quantitative differences in PG composition in response to high light stress and degreening were determined by differential stable-isotope labeling using formaldehyde. More than 20 proteins were identified in the PG proteome of pepper <b>chromoplasts,</b> including four enzymes of carotenoid biosynthesis and several homologs of proteins observed in the chloroplast PGs. Our data strongly suggest that PGs in chloroplasts form a functional metabolic link between the inner envelope and thylakoid membranes and play a role in breakdown of carotenoids and oxidative stress defense, whereas PGs in <b>chromoplasts</b> are also an active site for carotenoid conversions...|$|R
