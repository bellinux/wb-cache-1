The {{state and its}} citizens are increasingly far apart, and the traditional parties do not fulfill their function of representation {{of the needs of}} <b>citizens.</b> <b>Europe</b> is undergoing an economic crisis but also a crisis of values. The balance between economic and social development are not balanced (Massé, 1964), and the reinvention of a new model of state, is already a necessity. The result of the processes of globalization, the role of government and citizen participation have been marginalized and increasingly subordinated to the dictates of the market. This paper aims to analyze a new concept of governance based on the relationship between state, market, Third Sector, and citizenship in order to clarify {{what is the best way}} of responding to social needs. The emphasis on the concepts of dialogue and participation as these show the relationship between the state, the market and the public, through an effective and efficient guidance and intervention in its governance (Canales, 2002) ...|$|E

The emergence of technology has changed the way of making transactions eliminating the human intervention. The economic organization in these terms focuses more on knowledge and communication than control and administrative hierarchy. The necessity for organizational culture research is given that this exerts a strong influence on a company performance and becomes more pronounced in dynamic conditions in the external environment. A culture must be accepted byall company employees and the managers have to identify cultural factors that hinder the development and transform these factors into values. The leaders are those who manage to create {{vision of the future}} that they wanted and they influence and, in turn, they are influenced by organizational culture. European context is characterized by a cultural variety and we can not speak of a management model as is the Japanese or the North American. Europe is characterized by the coexistence of many cultures which presents similarities and considerable differences. Makridakis, in his "Single Market Europe” remarked that the EU cannot be treated as a unicultural organization. Cultural differences existing in the EU is not an obstacle to European integration; they can become the source of many competitive advantages for the EU <b>citizens.</b> <b>Europe</b> isshowing a trend of convergence of his values: decrease of the religious values as a source of moral obligation; the development of the democratic political system; the increase of the social relations values. We are able to conclude that, at the cultural level of Europe, is characterized by great diversity based on a set of commonand similar values, which are major components of European integration...|$|E

The book {{is a kind of}} proceedings publication, which puts together the key outputs of all the events that were organized within the project. The topics selected in separate chapters in the book – Networking, Education, Environment Protection and Consumer Protection and Food Safety – are all matters of continuing interest and importance. The book is result of a joint work by the Institute for Development and International Relations (IRMO) from Zagreb and the Institute for International and European Affairs (IIEA) from Dublin. Its aim is to raise awareness of the impacts, challenges and opportunities of EU membership for Croatia, based on the successful Irish experience within the academic community and the best practice of communicating Europe to citizens. The Irish experiences were chosen having in mind the fact that Ireland had a long experience with communicating Europe to citizens. By the time of its accession, Ireland had passed through extensive and lively debates that included a successful referendum in 1972 with a high turnout of citizens. Furthermore, each subsequent amendment of the EEC and the EU Treaties has been put to a referendum. This extensive experience might be useful for Croatia during the accession process. Networking, as another important aspect of communicating EU integration issues, was also in the focus of the project and of this book. The experience of conducting the Europe-wide "network of excellence" established through the FP 6 project, EU CONSENT– Wider Europe, Deeper Integration?, in which IRMO and IIEA are participating together with some fifty European institutes, higher education institutions and think-tanks, was particularly valuable in that context.
