40|$|When small {{electronic}} components with glass-to-metal seals are closure welded, residual stresses {{developed in the}} glass are of concern. If these stresses exceed allowable tensile levels` the resulting weld-induced seal failure may cause the entire component to be scrapped or reworked at substantial cost. Conventional wisdom says the best welding process for these applications is that which provides the least heat input, and that Laser Beam Welding (LBW) provides less heat input than Gas Tungsten Arc Welding. (GTAW); however, other concerns such as weld fit-up, part variability, and material weldability can modify the final choice of a welding process. In this paper we compare the characteristic levels of heat input and the residual stresses generated in the glass seals for the two processes (as calculated by 3 D Finite Element Analysis) {{as a function of}} heat input and travel speed, and contrast some of the other manufacturing decisions that must be made to choose a production process. The geometry chosen is a standing edge <b>corner</b> <b>weld</b> in a cylindrical container about 20 mm diameter by 35 mm tall. Four metal pins are glassed into the part lid. The stresses calculated to result from continuous wave C 0 {sub 2 } LBW are compared with those that result from GTAW. The total energy required by the laser weld is significantly less than for the equivalent size GTA weld. The energy input required for a given size weld is inversely proportional to the travel speed, but approaches a saturation level as the travel speed increases. LBW travel speeds ranging from 10 mm/sec to 50 mm/sec were examined...|$|E

In the case of the MIG/MAG welding process, the technological measurements that are being regarded in the ascending and descending of the vertical welding refer to: the use of transfer modes through short circuit and pulsed current, the use of core wires instead of solid wires, the crossing from the semi-mechanized to automatic or robotical welding, that allows the use of complex radial oscillation systems, that assure a good control of the metal bath. The paper wants to make a comparative technological and economical analysis between the vertical ascendent MAG welding using solid wire or core wire.

40|$|Welding is a {{reliable}} and efficient joining {{process in which the}} coalescence of metals is achieved by fusion. Welding is carried out with a very complex thermal cycle which results in irreversible elastic-plastic deformation and residual stresses in and around fusion zone and heat affected zone (HAZ). Due to the presence of residual stresses in and around the weld zone the strength and life of the component is largely reduced. An application of corner joint of square hollow section (IS 4923 : 1997 YSt 240) of 49. 5 mm x 49. 5 mm x 2. 0 mm in size is welded by the Metal Active Gas (MAG) process.

40|$|Schumacher, ThomasNationwide, a {{significant}} amount of bridges within the National Bridge inventory (NBI) have been found to develop fatigue cracks. Typically section(s) in and surrounding welded connection details are particularly prone to the development of fatigue cracks {{as a result of the}} significant stress concentration. Existing flaws and/or discontinuities caused by notches, <b>corners,</b> <b>welding</b> toes etc., under the presence of tensile stresses will encourage the initiation and propagation of these cracks. Fatigue cracks found in bridge members can become potential areas of concern for bridge owners, as if not mitigated, continued cyclically applied loading to the bridge encourages the propagation of these cracks at these connection details. Ultimately, these cracks can lead to the possible gross deformation, loss of function or serviceability, or complete separation of the component known as fracture. Although fatigue inherently does not always lead to fracture of a structural component, it must be considered as potential consequence of the development of fatigue cracks if not diminished. As a result of this propagating issue, a holistic approach to the rehabilitation of cracks found in these steel bridge members has been deployed. This approach emphasizes the use of composite materials in addition to a carbon nanotube (CNT) -based sensing layer in order to create a structural patch to be applied over a fatigue crack. This patch not only rehabilitates damaged sections but also continuously monitors its progress through use of the CNT sensing layer. If employed properly, this new technique of utilizing a composite patch over the fatigue crack will inevitably decrease the overall stress concentration exhibited around the crack/crack mouth, which ultimately prolongs the general fatigue life of the structural member.

40|$|Abstract. The use of {{aluminium}} alloys rose in the last decade, as its specific mechanical properties allow a reduction of mass as for example in automotive. Moreover aluminium, due to its high corrosion resistance, {{is a very important}} material class in plant construction, where it is used for pipes or container till 250 °C. Aluminium can be welded with different technologies. Nowadays TIG and MIG are mainly used for example in plant construction or in mechanical engineering. Laser beam welding is a widely established technology in automotive. The advantage is the high energy concentration, which leads to a high welding speed and a narrow heat affected zone. Plasma welding is applied when joining aluminium with alternating current, as an easy removal of the oxide layer in the surface of the weld pool is possible. Plasma-Powder-Arc-Welding (PPAW) method has been developed from Plasma Transferred Arc (PTA) weld surfacing and Plasma Arc Welding (PAW) methods by combining a small PAW torch (PAW is traditionally performed with wire as filler material) with powder filler material feeding as used in PTA-equipment. The coupling leads to a better mechanisation of the welding process as the consumable is fed directly through the welding torch. In this paper investigations on aluminium sheets (≤ 2 mm) AA 5 xxx and AA 6 xxx using different powder materials are reported. The influence of the processing parameters and conditions on the process reliability, when welding with industrial robots butt and <b>corner</b> <b>welds</b> is investigated. Conventional PPAW {{of aluminium}} is performed with AlSi 12 filler material. A post processing of the joint, as for example anodising in order to improve corrosion resistance, leads to a very different optical aspect, as the colouration of the weld seam after anodising differs from the base material.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{differences}} between the alternative types of structural hollow section products (cold-formed versus hot-finished) as they affect structural design in Europe, using the relevant product and design standards, with an emphasis on Rectangular Hollow Sections (RHS). Manufacturers of cold-formed structural hollow sections (CFSHS) are more numerous, so that their products are more widely available. Hot-finished structural hollow section (HFSHS) products are typically between 24 % and 54 % more expensive in Germany than their cold-formed counter-parts, the lower differences being for large tonnages – a strong inducement in favour of CFSHS. The price difference may also vary within the European Union. The geometric and product prop-erties which are distinctly unique to CFSHS are presented and shown to offer no restrictions in their use when in compliance with the appropriate clauses in the European standards. These are the influence of <b>corner</b> radii, <b>welding</b> in the <b>corner</b> area, material choice to avoid brittle fracture and suitability for welding CFSHS. A comparison of the structural performance of CFSHS and HFSHS shows equally efficient structural designs for both products.

CFSHS are shown to be adequate under all these situations. ...|$|R

The predominantly welded hull construction allowed small cracks to propagate unimpeded, unlike in a hull made of separate plates riveted together. One common type of crack nucleated at the square corner of a hatch which coincided with a welded seam, both the <b>corner</b> and the <b>weld</b> acting as stress concentrators. Furthermore, the ships were frequently grossly overloaded, increasing stresses, and some of the problems occurred during or after severe storms at sea that would have placed any ship at risk.

The successor Victory ship used the same steel, with improved design to reduce potential fatigue.|$|R
40|$|A {{microstructural}} {{investigation was}} performed on {{a new type of}} friction joining – stationary shoulder <b>corner</b> friction stir <b>welding</b> (SSCFSW). This technique involves welding at a 45 ° angle and using filler materials in order to produce rounded <b>corner</b> <b>welds.</b> The filler materials were later coated in copper to ascertain the flow behaviour of the material and to determine what happens to the interface between the vertical and horizontal columns being welded. A new phenomenon – the so called “blades” effect – demonstrated two clearly defined regions within the dynamically recrystallised zone (DRX) which had different chemical compositions from each other. 	The investigation focused on some of the most commonly used wrought aluminium alloys – 2 xxx, 5 xxx, 6 xxx, and 7 xxx series aluminium. These were selected to give a good comparison between heat treated and non-heat treated alloys. Different aluminium series were also cross welded (2 xxx to 7 xxx) in order to assess feasibility and material flow behaviour. The vast majority of welds were performed in the 6 xxx series material; these included the copper tracer samples and a stationary shoulder friction stir butt weld. 	The first type of analysis was hardness mapping and was initially applied to cross welded alloys AA 2014 -T 4 and AA 7075 -T 6. The hardness maps showed that there were sharp hardness transitions within the DRX. Further analysis with SEM/EDS revealed that the “blades” region - which demonstrated highest hardness within the DRX – was exclusively AA 7075 -T 6 and that the “non-blades” region was exclusively AA 2014 -T 4. Hardness maps were also performed on SSCFSW 6082 -T 6 and 5083 -O. As these were not cross welded materials they didn’t exhibit the same sharp transitions in hardness across the “blade” and “non-blade” regions. However, the hardness profiles did highlight the difference heat treated and non-heat treated alloys, as the 6 xxx series saw a drop of hardness across the DRX with some recovery, and the 5 xxx series material saw an increase in hardness across the DRX. Both AA 7075 -T 6 and AA 2014 -T 4 are heat treated alloys, so the intense thermo-mechanical process of FSW is expected to cause the hardening precipitates to coarsen and dissolve. Depending on the post weld cooling process the dissolved second phase precipitates may reprecipitate and cause the material to regain some of its hardness. The blade and non-blade regions in the cross welded alloys were segregated on the basis of alloys composition, i. e. the blade region was entirely AA 7075 and the non-blade region was entirely AA 2014. Thus the post weld cooling phase favoured reprecipitation in AA 7075 over AA 2014, hence the far higher hardness measurements found in the blade region. For alloys that weren’t cross welded, {{the difference between the two}} regions is negligible, indicating that blade and non-blade regions are a primarily a result of material flow. 	Further tests were carried out on 6082 -T 6 welds but using copper tracers either between the interfaces of the two aluminium plates to be welded or around the filler wires that would be incorporated into the SSCFSW. A visual inspection showed the distinct presence of the blade and non-blade regions and that copper had preferentially distributed itself into the blade regions. A SEM and EDS {{was performed on}} the blade and non-blade regions and confirmed that the blades were copper rich and the non-blades regions were copper free. The filler wires that were coated in copper also saw the copper distributed preferentially into the blade region, however, as the filler wires are only consumed the in the top half of the weld, no copper was found towards the base the weld. This indicated that while material is being segregated during welding it is not massively being dragged down. A copper tracer was also placed between the interface of two plates in a stationary shoulder FSW butt weld, and once again the copper preferentially segregated itself into the blade regions. This indicates that the main mechanism for the blade effect is the stationary shoulder and tool, not the angle of the weld. Crystallographic texture analysis was performed using EBSD for the DRX stretching from the advancing side to the retreating side of weld region. Both regions towards the base and top of the weld region were analysed for a single material SSCFSW of AA 6082 -T 6. The texture had a strong crystal orientation, and was dominated by simple shear torsion texture. The simple shear components of / and C were detected, but instead of a uniform distribution, alternating bands of the B and components, and trace amounts of the C components. For the stationary shoulder butt welds in AA 6082 -T 6 a similar pattern emerged, but with a much stronger detection of the C component, and more in a banded formation. For the other aluminium alloys tested, the prevalence of the crystal texture was also observed, along with the simple shear components of / and C, but the presence of banding was either faint or non-existent. There was no evidence of the blade effect occurring in terms of texture, as EBSD runs were performed across bands that contained both blade and non-blade regions. The blades effect appears to be primarily a result of material flow behaviour and not dynamic recrystallisation mechanisms. The DRX has a consistent grain size throughout, but certain materials during welding preferentially distribute themselves either into the ‘blade’ or ‘non-blade’ regions. This phenomenon is likely to be linked to the threading on the tool used for the SSCFSW process, and the lack of interference of the shoulder. ...|$|R

40|$|The use of Design of Experiment (DOE) {{can have}} vast {{impact on the}} {{measurement}} need. A study conducted at Volvo CE by Hammersberg and Olsson was aiming at finding settings for parameters influencing weld toe radii, throat size and penetration. The performed DOE concluded a process window where all three requirements were achieved. The parameters identified {{were related to the}} welding geometry rather than the commonly varied welding parameters. Positioning of parts and weld torch as well asgap size had larger impact than productivity parameters such as amperage and weld speed. This is surprising since most investigations do not uncouple parameters for weld geometry from those controlling productivity. A possibility to control the weld quality by adjusting indirect parameters independently from the productivity emerges. From an inspection perspective that is very influential. In the studied case that means monitoring angles and gap size proactively before welding instead of inspecting weld toe radii, throat size and penetration after welding in a reactive manner. There are difficulties connected to the measurement of penetration and weld toe radius. It is in comparison relatively easy to control angles and gap sizes. This observation means new challenges for the organization on the meta-level. It seems necessary to have incremental improvement of competence and joint understanding and to have a critical mass of people having the same view. Not until 7 years after the first study of lack of measurement precision the organization was ready, as an organisation, to apply the optimized design of experiment, even though single individuals were trained earlier. When educating the team as a team the best results were achieved, probably because a common language and new culture emerged. This indicates that the challenge of improved welding performance lay in the elevated organisational plane, rather than on individual competence and technology level.

40|$|In {{the case}} of {{structural}} weldments, the procedure for estimating fatigue life requires information concerning geometry of the object, loads and material. Detailed knowledge of stress fields in the critical regions of weldments is {{used to determine the}} fatigue life. The main theme of the research discussed in this thesis is to provide details of the methodology which has been developed to determine peak stress and associated non-linear through thickness stress distribution at the critical weld toe location by using only the geometry dependent stress concentration factors along with appropriate unique reference stress calculated in an efficient manner e. g. without modeling geometrical weld toe details. The peak stress at the weld toe can be subsequently used for estimating the fatigue crack initiation life. The non-linear through thickness stress distribution and the weight function method can be used for the determination of stress intensity factors and for the analysis of subsequent fatigue crack growth. Accurate peak stress estimation requires 3 D fine mesh finite element (FE) models, accounting for the micro-geometrical features, such as the weld toe angle and weld toe radius. Such models are computationally expensive and therefore impractical. On the other hand, stresses at sharp <b>weld</b> <b>corners</b> obtained from 3 D coarse FE meshes are inaccurate and cannot be used directly for fatigue life estimations. A robust, sufficiently accurate, efficient and practical approach is proposed for fatigue life estimation of welded structures based on 3 D coarse mesh FE models. Another objective is to establish a methodology which is capable of accounting for the actual variability of stress concentration factors at welds, welding defects such as misalignment and incomplete penetration resulting from manufacturing processes. The proposed approach is capable of accounting for the effects from use of different material and effect of residual stresses from welding process. Residual stress information is obtained from a welding process simulation model, which has been validated against measured residual stress data. The proposed methodology has been validated using numerical and experimental data by analyzing different weldments of varying geometrical and load configurations. Further, the applicability of the stress field obtained from the proposed methodology is demonstrated by using it in a forward looking “Total Fatigue Life” concept based only on the fracture mechanics approach...|$|R
