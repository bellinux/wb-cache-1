50|$|Toronto, Canada’s largest city, {{was one of}} {{the hardest}} hit by the ice storm.

The second, more powerful wave of rain struck the city in the early morning of December 22. Utility poles and tree branches collapsed {{under the weight of the}} thick ice accumulation. At the height of the storm over 300,000 Toronto Hydro customers had no electricity or heating. The City of Toronto simultaneously opened and operated 13 <b>community</b> <b>reception</b> centers and 13 Toronto police facility community warming centers, providing temporary sleeping accommodation, food, water, hygiene kits and other resources. The warming centers operated 24 hours a day, offering those without electricity a warm place to sleep and eat until their power was restored. By December 24, four days after the storm, 69,800 customers throughout the city were still without electricity. Approximately 1,000 people spent Christmas Eve in the warming centers. On December 29, Hydro One diverted its crews to assist Toronto Hydro to help restore power to over 6,000 people in the city who were still without power. In addition to Hydro One, crews were called in from Ottawa, Windsor and Michigan and Manitoba to help restore power to the city by the New Year.

40|$|Diasporic {{communities}} that advance their ancestral homelands through forging links with {{it can be}} best examined {{in the context of}} the history of migration of these communities and the culture of developing stakes in the homeland through material and emotional investments of various kinds. While globalization of migration has facilitated diasporas of various kinds, there has been a marked turn of gaze towards the homeland by diasporic members. What ties the emigrant/diasporics with the places of origin are collective meso-structures of village communities/associations and hometown networks which integrate and manage the changes induced by migration, in maintaining and constructing boundaries, villages spaces, resources, hierarchies, norms and practices. While migration encompasses a whole range of social, political and economic factors, the focus of this study in a village in North Gujarat, western India is not on why people migrate nor on why people give but rather on the effects and meanings that migration and collective remittances would hold for individuals or groups in ‘places of origin’. This search for meanings would entail an understanding of the values, structures and expectations that inhere in acts of giving. While reconstructing the local <b>community’s</b> <b>reception</b> of the emergent dual character of diasporic giving, which is, charitable ‘sacred’ giving – the Indian equivalent of ‘dan’ on the one hand and ‘non-sacred’ giving - towards development works in a village setting on the other, what impingements they may have on local development processes and on the formation of ‘village collectives’ will be further interrogated...|$|R

40|$|In this book, Jennifer A. McMahon {{argues that}} a reading of Kant's body {{of work in the}} light of a pragmatist theory of meaning and {{language}} (which arguably is a Kantian legacy) leads one to put <b>community</b> <b>reception</b> ahead of individual reception in the order of aesthetic relations. A core premise of the book is that neopragmatism draws attention to an otherwise overlooked aspect of Kant's "Critique of Aesthetic Judgment," and this is the conception of community which it sets forth. While offering an interpretation of Kant's aesthetic theory, the book focuses on the implications of Kant's third Critique for contemporary art. McMahon draws upon Kant and his legacy in pragmatist theories of meaning and language to argue that aesthetic reflective judgment cultivates a capacity exercised by moral judgment, which is conducive to community and plays a pivotal role in the evolution of language, meaning and knowledge.

40|$|Abstract This article investigates {{differences}} {{in the mental health}} among male and female immigrants from an ecological perspective, testing the influences of both individual acculturation domains and social contexts. Data from the first nationally representative psychiatric survey of immigrant Asians in the US is used (N = 1, 583). These data demonstrate the importance of understanding acculturation domains (e. g., individual {{differences in}} English proficiency, ethnic identity, and time in the US), within the social contexts of family, community, and neighborhood. Results demonstrate that among immigrant Asian women, the association between family conflict and mental health problems is stronger for those with higher ethnic identity; among immigrant Asian men, <b>community</b> <b>reception</b> (e. g., everyday discrimination) was more highly associated with increases in mental health symptoms among those with poor English fluency. Findings suggest that both individual domains of acculturation and social context measures contribute to immigrant mental health, and {{that it is important to}} consider these relationships within the context of gender...|$|E
5000|$|The Chinese <b>community’s</b> <b>reception</b> to One Hundred Years: History of the Chinese in America {{initially}} was controversial. Although many {{elements of the}} painting were historically correct, the Chinatown community rejected Leong’s mural. While some believed the depiction {{of the characters in}} the mural to be too Chinese, others found the subjects to be too American. The sad faces of the subjects, the Chinese men with queues, and the Chinese women picking shrimp with infants on their backs proved to be an all-too truthful look into the Chinese American past. On the other hand, the non-Chinese community embraced the painting and saw the piece as a breakthrough of historical depiction. As Asian American awareness picked up in the 1960s at places like San Francisco State University, many saw Leong’s mural to be an example of [...] "Uncle Tomming”, or the participation of the Chinese in their own oppression within America. Adding to the controversy {{at the height of the}} McCarthy era, the FBI, Kuomintang, and Chinese Communist Party suspected Leong to have hidden secret messages within his mural. No conspiracy was ever proven, but such aggressive political oppression and the backlash of the Chinese community further drove Leong’s motivations to continue his artwork outside of San Francisco. In 1978, Leong discovered that his painting had been moved to Ping Yuen’s recreational room, where it suffered under time and ignorance. The historic mural was propped up on chairs in the recreational room, children had hit ping-pong balls against it, and soda and food were spilled on the painting. Leong’s mural sat quietly in Ping Yuen’s recreational room until the late 1990s, when the Chinese Historical Society of America acquired the painting. In 2000, James Leong meticulously restored the painting to its previous vibrancy. As of November 13, 2001, One Hundred Years: History of the Chinese in America hangs in the Chinese Historical Society of America’s Museum and Learning Center.|$|R
