40|$|White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are {{important}} game mammals and potential reservoirs of diseases of domestic livestock; thus, diseases of deer are {{of great concern}} to wildlife managers. Contact, either direct or indirect, is necessary for disease transmission, but we know little about the ecological contexts that promote intrasexual contact among deer. Using pair-wise direct contacts estimated from Global Positioning System collar locations and joint utilization distributions (JUDs), we assessed habitats in which contacts occur to test whether direct <b>contact</b> <b>rates</b> among female white-tailed deer in different social groups differs among land-cover types. We also tested whether <b>contact</b> <b>rates</b> differed among seasons, lunar phases, and times of day. We obtained locations from 27 female deer for periods of 0. 5 – 17 months during 2002 – 2006. We designated any simultaneous pair of locations for 2 deer, 25 m apart as a direct contact. For each season, we used compositional analysis to compare land-cover types where 2 deer had contact to available land-cover weighted by their JUD. We used mixedmodel logistic regression to test for effects of season, lunar phase, and time of day on <b>contact</b> <b>rates.</b> <b>Contact</b> <b>rates</b> during the gestation season were greater than expected from random use in forest and grassland cover, whereas <b>contact</b> <b>rates</b> during the fawning period were greater in agricultural fields than in other land-cover types. <b>Contact</b> <b>rates</b> were greatest during the rut and lowest in summer.

It was intended that parents and teachers would develop a partnership and work in a collaborative manner {{on behalf of the}} children. Surveys of participating parents and teachers indicated that the lack of cooperation between parents and children resulted from parents ' lack of training in effective parenting skills and teachers ' lack of the skills they needed to work effectively with young children. To remedy this situation, a consultant implemented and evaluated 24 in-service training sessions and 8 counseling sessions with 29 parents and 10 teachers in child development, effective parenting skills, early childhood education, and multicultural education. The sessions provided parents with effective strategies for recognizing developmentally appropriate behaviors in their children, provided teachers with training in multicultural education, and built collaboration between teachers and parents.

Aim To test {{whether there is a}} significant association between general practice patient <b>contact</b> <b>rates</b> and the council tax valuation band of their residential address. Design of study Cross-sectional analyses using data recorded, over 1 year, for over 3300 general practice patients. Setting One medium-sized group practice in an industrialised English market town. Method Face-to-face contacts between the patients and the doctors and nurses in the practice were compared by patient age, sex, registration period, distance from surgery, Underprivileged Area 8 (UPA 8) score, and council tax valuation band. Results Patient sex, age, recent registration, distance from surgery, and council tax valuation band were each significantly associated with face-to-face <b>contact</b> <b>rate</b> in univariate analyses. UPA 8 score was not significantly associated with <b>contact</b> <b>rates.</b> On multivariate testing, sex, age, recent registration, and council tax valuation band remained significantly associated with <b>contact</b> <b>rates.</b> The last is a new finding.

40|$|In social species, {{individuals}} contact {{members of}} the same group much more often than those of other groups, particularly for contacts that could directly transmit disease agents. This disparity in <b>contact</b> <b>rates</b> violates the assumptions of simple disease models, hinders disease spread between groups, and could decouple disease transmission from population density. Social behavior of white-tailed deer has important implications for the long-term dynamics and impact of diseases such as bovine tuberculosis and chronic wasting disease (CWD), so expanding our understanding of their social system is important. White-tailed deer form matrilineal groups, which inhabit stable home ranges that overlap somewhat with others—a pattern intermediate between mass-action and strict territoriality. To quantify how group membership affects their <b>contact</b> <b>rates</b> and document the spectrum of social affiliation, we analyzed location data from global positioning system (GPS) collars on female and juvenile white-tailed deer in 2 study areas: near Carbondale in forest-dominated southern Illinois (2002 – 2006) and near Lake Shelbyville in agriculture-dominated central Illinois (2006 – 2009). For each deer dyad (i. e., 2 individual deer with sufficient overlapping GPS data), we measured space-use overlap, correlation of movements, direct <b>contact</b> <b>rate</b> (simultaneous GPS locations 3 ̆c 10 m apart), and indirect <b>contact</b> <b>rate</b> (GPS locations 3 ̆c 10 m apart when offset by 1 or 3 days). Direct <b>contact</b> <b>rates</b> were substantially higher for within-group dyads than between-group dyads, but group membership had little apparent effect on indirect <b>contact</b> <b>rates.</b> The group membership effect on direct <b>contact</b> <b>rates</b> was strongest in winter and weakest in summer, with no apparent difference between study areas. Social affiliations were not dichotomous, with some deer dyads showing loose but positive affiliation. Even for obvious within-group dyads, their strength of affiliation fluctuated between years, seasons, and even days. Our findings highlight the poor fit between deer behavior and simple models of disease transmission and, combined with previous infection data, suggest that direct contact is the primary driver of CWD transmission among free living female and juvenile white-tailed deer...|$|R

Although managers can estimate transmission coefficients from the relationship between disease prevalence and age or time, they may wish to quantify or compare <b>contact</b> <b>rates</b> before a disease is established or while it is at very low prevalence. Our objectives were to quantify direct and indirect <b>contacts</b> <b>rates</b> among white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and to compare these measures of <b>contact</b> <b>rate</b> with simpler measures of joint space use. We deployed Global Positioning System (GPS) collars on 23 deer near Carbondale, Illinois, USA, from 2002 to 2005. We used location data from the GPS collars to measure pairwise rates of direct and indirect contact, based {{on a range of}} proximity criteria and time lags, as well as volume of intersection (VI) of kernel utilization distributions. We analyzed <b>contact</b> <b>rates</b> at a given distance criterion and time lag using mixed-model logistic regression. Direct <b>contact</b> <b>rates</b> increased with increasing VI and were higher in autumn–spring than in summer. After accounting for VI, the estimated odds of direct contact during autumn–spring periods were 5. 0 – 22. 1 -fold greater (depending on the proximity criterion) for pairs of deer in the same social group than for between-group pairs, but for direct contacts during summer the within:between-group odds ratio did not differ significantly from 1. Indirect <b>contact</b> <b>rates</b> also increased with VI, but the effects of both season and pair-type were much smaller than for direct contacts and differed little as the time lag increased from 1 – 30 days. These results indicate that simple measures of joint space use are insufficient indices of direct contact because group membership can substantially increase contacts at a given level of joint space use. With indirect transmission, however, group membership had a much smaller influence after accounting for VI. Relationships between <b>contact</b> <b>rates</b> and season, VI, and pair-type were generally robust to changes in the proximity criterion defining a contact, and patterns of indirect contacts were affected little by the choice of time lag from 1 – 30 days.
