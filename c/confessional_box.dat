2500|$|In Catholic teaching, the Sacrament of Penance is {{the method}} of the Church by which {{individual}} men and women may confess sins committed after baptism and have them absolved by God through the administration of a Priest. Although it is not mandatory, the Catholic rite is usually conducted within a <b>confessional</b> <b>box,</b> booth or reconciliation room. This sacrament is known by many names, including penance, reconciliation and confession (Catechism of the Catholic Church, Sections 1423-1442). While official Church publications usually refer to the sacrament as [...] "Penance", [...] "Reconciliation" [...] or [...] "Penance and Reconciliation", many laypeople continue {{to use the term}} [...] "Confession" [...] in reference to the Sacrament.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} section of the show, Madonna {{performs}} with fake firearms during the first three songs. She begins with [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] holding a rifle and [...] "breaks" [...] the glass, of a <b>confessional</b> <b>box,</b> she later performs [...] "Revolver" [...] with female dancers dancing with automatic rifles. During the third song, [...] "Gang Bang" [...] she performed in a motel setting where she is seen shooting the male dancers who infiltrate her room with blood being splattered on the backdrops. In wake of the 2012 Aurora shooting, Madonna was urged to remove the use of firearms from the show. Authorities previously warned the singer about use of guns for the concert in Edinburgh, before the events in Colorado. However, the order was reinforced after the tragedy occurred. Madonna continued the show in Scotland as planned, {{with the use of the}} props. During the concert, she expressed her joy for first concert in the country, saying she could be onstage for three hours. She then joked, [...] "Due to your laws here they might pull the plug on me so if they cut us off suddenly, write to your local MP".|$|E

5000|$|Notable {{fittings}} in {{the church}} include the marble high altar, <b>confessional</b> <b>boxes,</b> stations of the cross, a shrine to Our Lady of Czestochowa and statues in the side altar recesses. The high altar is of white marble with green marble detailing and is centrally placed within the chancel below a [...] "rose" [...] window glazed with coloured glass depicting a crown and cross within a circle surmounted by a fleur-di-lis. Two timber <b>confessional</b> <b>boxes</b> are found {{at the rear of}} the church. These are separated into three small rooms with a small perforated timber panel with sliding closing panel in the two internal connecting walls. The timber framed stations of the cross are surmounted by a broken pedimented entablature similar to those which surmount the two <b>confessional</b> <b>boxes.</b>|$|R

50|$|So Johnny is ordained as the people's Pope. However, {{he learns}} that MacLean raped {{his mother in}} the <b>confessional</b> <b>box</b> {{when she was just}} sixteen and that he is in fact Johnny’s father. Things get even worse for Johnny when it then transpires that Maclean murdered Mary in order to get his hands on Johnny. Johnny swears revenge, so MacLean plans to have his client assassinated live on his TV show, The Vatican Tonite.|$|E
50|$|Changes to {{the church}} over time have been minor and reflect the changes in liturgical {{practice}} following the Second Vatican Council called by Pope John XXIII in the 1960s. These include {{the removal of the}} <b>confessional</b> <b>box,</b> the relocation of the altar rails and the separation of the altar table {{from the back of the}} altar to allow the priest to face the congregation. The southern side of the entrance porch has been enclosed, presumably to shield it from the weather.|$|E
50|$|Reverend Arthur Wagner's churches {{followed}} the Anglo-Catholic Ritualist tradition, {{for which he}} often faced hostility and attack from reactionary Protestant figures within the Anglican church. In 1902, the ecclesiastical court ruled {{that many of the}} elaborate fixtures within the church, including icons, candlesticks and <b>confessional</b> <b>boxes,</b> had to be removed, after receiving a complaint. In the interwar period, however, there was a new wave of decoration and ornamentation, including the introduction of two reredos.|$|R
500|$|St. Andrew Church {{is located}} in Ciruelos, [...] from Pichilemu. It was {{constructed}} in 1779, and its altar {{was built in the}} 1940s. It has a harmonium, <b>confessional</b> <b>boxes,</b> and ancient images of saints. Its original image of St. Andrew was made of papier mache. The old parish was created by Archbishop Rafael Valentín Valdivieso in 1864. Cardinal José María Caro Rodríguez was baptized there. The feast day of St. Andrew is celebrated every November 30 at the church.|$|R
50|$|The pulpit {{dates to}} 1744 and was {{donated to the}} church by François de Lesquelen along with the <b>confessional</b> <b>boxes.</b> The stone baptismal font dates to the 16th century and has an {{octagonal}} baldachin with a dome {{said to have been}} inspired by the clock tower at the Notre Dame de Berven chapel in Plouzévédé. The font is decorated with statues in kersanton which are attributed to Roland Doré and are of Matthew the Evangelist, Mark the Evangelist, the Holy Father holding Jesus in his arms, Saint Gregory the Grand Pope, Saint John and Saint Ambrose the vicar of Milan.|$|R
5000|$|In this chapel {{there is}} a {{beautiful}} carved wooden <b>confessional</b> <b>box</b> and the window has some fragments which date to the 14th century.The altar is wooden with a statue in white stone of saint Joseph. In the 19th-century stained glass window, the depiction is of Margaret of Antioch with a chained demon. This single lancet window dates to 1872 and is by Henry Ely. The window bears the inscription [...] "Ste MARGUERITE". The chapel {{is divided into two}} parts and also contains a statue of sainte Theresa with the baby Jesus which dates to 1928.|$|E
5000|$|The {{history of}} {{sexuality}} has expanded {{in recent years}} from studies of marriage and sexuality to homosexuality, and other expressions of sexuality, including bestiality. [...] Of particular note is Ann Twinam's work on honor and illegitimacy in the colonial era; there is a similar work for Peru. The memoir of the nun-turned-cross-dressing soldier, Catalina de Erauso, is a picaresque tale {{and one of the}} few autobiographies form the colonial era. The problem of priests soliciting sexual favors in the <b>confessional</b> <b>box</b> and church responses to the abuse draws on Inquisition cases.|$|E

25|$|In mid-June 1816, all {{nighttime}} processions {{were banned}} except that of Corpus Christi. In 1819, the Bishop was persuaded to transfer {{authority to the}} vicar-general, while in 1820 friars were secularised. On August 4, 1820, all clergy were forced to swear allegiance to the state, and their clerical immunities were withdrawn. The four monasteries in the country were nationalised in 1824, with one later demolished and another becoming a parish church. The remaining two became an artillery park and barracks, while three convents also became barracks. He abolished the Inquisition, re-purposed <b>confessional</b> <b>boxes</b> as sentry posts, and had the hangings made into lancers' red waistcoats.|$|R
50|$|When Vatican II {{changes in}} liturgy {{occurred}} in 1962/1964 the Long Tower priests and parishioners {{did not want}} to change the layout too much. Indeed, the Council documents did not mandate any changes to church sanctuaries. In 1964 a temporary wooden altar was constructed and installed in the sanctuary to accommodate Mass being said facing the people. In 1979 the wooden altar was taken out and a new marble altar along with a new marble lectern and celebrants ambo were installed. The installation was minor to ensure the remainder of the church stayed. When other churches at this time were removing altar rails, High Altars, <b>confessional</b> <b>boxes</b> etc., the Long Tower did not. In 2012 the celebrant's marble ambo was removed from the sanctuary and the marble was used to create a brand new celebrant's chair in the sanctuary.|$|R
5000|$|The confessional in {{its modern}} form dates no farther back than the 16th century, and Du Cange cites the year 1563 {{for an early}} {{use of the word}} confessionale for the sacrum poenitentiae tribunal. Originally the term was applied to the place where a martyr or [...] "confessor" [...] (in the sense of one who confesses Christ) had been buried. There are, however, {{instances}} (e.g. the confessional of Church of St. Trophime at Arles) where the name was attached to the spot, whether cell or seat, where noted saints were wont to hear confessions. In the popular Protestant view <b>confessional</b> <b>boxes</b> are associated with the scandals, real or supposed, of the practice of auricular confession. They were, however, devised to guard against such scandals by securing at once essential publicity and a reasonable privacy, and by separating priest and penitent. In the Middle Ages stringent rules were laid down, in this latter respect, by the canon law in the case of confessions by women and especially nuns. In England, before the Protestant Reformation, publicity was reckoned the best safeguard. Thus Archbishop Walter Reynolds, in 1322, says in his Constitutions: [...] "Let the priest choose for himself a common place for hearing confessions, where he may be seen generally by all in the church; and do not let him hear any one, and especially any woman, in a private place, except in great necessity." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{his duties}} {{as a priest}} he {{was known for his}} devotion to catechetical work and he also {{prepared}} children for the reception of the sacraments. He also spent hours in the <b>confessional</b> <b>box</b> and claimed that the main task of a priest was to help and to console parishioners who needed to confess their sins. The Governor admired him so much to the point that he put Grassi's portrait in the town hall as a form of commemoration and recognition for his services as a mediator between warring factions. His devotion to charitable works was boundless: he provided to all those who were poor and asked for alms to continue his work. The extent of this was so proverbial to the point where fellow Oratorians criticized him for excessive donations and works - but Grassi said that Divine Providence would provide and would work through them.|$|E
5000|$|René disguises {{himself as}} a priest {{and goes to the}} local church (accompanied by Yvette). In there, he enters the priest's place in the <b>confessional</b> <b>box.</b> The plan is for the colonel to enter the confessor's place, give the gold to [...] "the priest" [...] and receive cash in exchange. However, the plan goes wrong, when Edith comes along and confesses a sin (her {{thoughts}} about her husband having an affair with their waitresses). This gives the real priest time to come to the church and, after Edith has gone, find René in the confession box. The next moment, the Germans enter the church and the colonel enters the confession box. However, the priest knows nothing of the plan, so when the colonel has given him the gold, he does not give him any cash in return, but tells him to do three [...] "Hail Marys" [...] and leave.|$|E
5000|$|One {{wing of the}} Hall {{contains}} a chapel which was used for secret religious services. According to [...] "Secret Hiding Places" [...] published in 1933, there was a trap door in the vestry floor concealed inside a <b>confessional</b> <b>box.</b> This led to the floor below and into the Hall {{and would have been}} used for priest to escape discovery. In 1920 a fall of plaster disclosed a secret door to a short tunnel in the wall leading to a look-out in the roof, from which the approach to the house could be watched. It was in poor condition at the time. Hiding places were also discovered (date unknown). In one of these chalices and vestments were found, which were subsequently kept at the local catholic church. A chalice, however, was stolen from the church in the 1970s. There are also reports of books being found under the floor during a restoration in the 1920s, including an early edition of Ptolemy's Geography. It is not known what happened to these.|$|E
60|$|From this {{conversation}} the bishop {{had made his}} way to the vicarage of Mogham Banks. The vicar of Mogham Banks was a sacerdotal socialist of the most advanced type, with the reputation of being closely in touch with the labour extremists. He was a man addicted to banners, prohibited ornaments, special services at unusual hours, and processions in the streets. His taste in chasubles was loud, he gardened in a cassock and, it was said, he slept in his biretta; he certainly slept in a hair shirt, and he littered his church with flowers, candles, side altars, <b>confessional</b> <b>boxes,</b> requests for prayers for the departed, and the like. There had already been two Kensitite demonstrations at his services, and altogether he was a source of considerable anxiety to the bishop. The bishop did his best not to know too exactly what was going on at Mogham Banks. Sooner or later he felt he would be forced to do something--and the longer he could put that off the better. But the Rev. Morrice Deans had promised to get together three or four prominent labour leaders for tea and a frank talk, and the opportunity was one not to be missed. So the bishop, after a hasty and not too digestible lunch in the refreshment room at Pringle, was now in a fly that smelt of straw and suggested infectious hospital patients, on his way through the industry-scarred countryside to this second conversation.|$|R
50|$|A <b>confessional</b> is a <b>box,</b> cabinet, or stall {{in which}} the priest in Christian churches sits to hear the confessions of penitents. It is the usual venue for the sacrament in the Roman Catholic Church, but similar {{structures}} are also used in Anglican churches of an Anglo-Catholic orientation, {{and also in the}} Lutheran Church. In the Catholic Church, confessions are only to be heard in a confessional or oratory, except for a just reason.|$|R
5000|$|Logan {{takes the}} {{captured}} William and Dolores to a Confederado camp. William tries to convince Logan {{to use his}} contacts in the park to smuggle Dolores to safety, but Logan instead cuts open Dolores' belly to show William she is not real. In response, Dolores cuts Logan {{in the face and}} manages to escape. While running away, she finds that the cut Logan made has suddenly gone. Logan makes amends with William, promising him that whatever happens in the park stays in the park. However, the next morning, Logan awakes to find that William has slaughtered all of the Confederados. William says that he has figured out [...] "how to play the game" [...] and threatens Logan into helping him find Dolores. Dolores returns to Escalante, the abandoned town and has a vision of entering the church, where other hosts are sitting on the benches and appear to have conversations with someone that only they can hear. Dolores goes into the <b>confessional</b> <b>box,</b> which takes her to an underground lab, where she remembers that she killed Arnold. When she returns to the surface, she encounters the Man in Black much to her horror.|$|E

5000|$|The present church {{replaced}} the old 'Star of the Sea' {{church in the}} centre of the original village. The former church was gabled-fronted, its main entrance facing the West, with a date plaque for 1841 set above the door but also with a side entrance which was more commonly used. Inside {{on both sides of the}} main entrance, between the inner and outer doors, narrow curved stairs led up to the [...] "Gallery". This was a slanting upper floor covering just over half of the church space. Here the choir sat and late comers could sneak in after mass had started. A large <b>confessional</b> <b>box</b> was located on the right towards the rear under this floor. Following changes in the liturgy the church originally had the traditional ad orientem altar mounted into the East wall as well as a later versus populum altar. A door to the sacristy led off to the right from the altar. Stained glass windows of the patron saints were transferred to the new church. The old church was built in the Gothic Revival style under the supervision of Thomas Hammond of Drogheda in 1839-1841 for the Rev. John Donnellan of St. Mary's Parish on the buff overlooking the bridge at Mornington were the Colpe stream enters the Boyne. This site was also previously the location of a small Penal-era chapel and before that a pre-Reformation church. The church listed in the ecclesiastical taxation (1302-06) of Pope Nicholas IV was first recorded as being a ruin in 1622, and part of its remains can still be found in the old graveyard adjoining.|$|E
40|$|In {{his film}} {{adaptation}} of Hamlet (1996),Kenneth Branagh under scores the confessional themes {{present in the}} play by setting two scenes in a Roman Catholic <b>confessional</b> <b>box.</b> In the first scene, Polonius interrogates Ophelia about her relationship with Hamlet-an interaction that reinforces the common association of the confessional with an obsession over female sexuality. In the second scene, Hamlet listens to Claudius 2 ̆ 7 s penitential prayer and becomes,as Mark Thornton Burnett notes, 2 ̆ 2 an unpunctual but unconsoling father confessor. 2 ̆ 2 l By depicting Hamlet and Claudius in the <b>confessional</b> <b>box,</b> Branagh introduces a conspicuous anachronism since the device was never used in early modem England and did not experience widespread use in Catholic countries on the Continent until the seventeenth century...|$|E

40|$|In October 2015, the {{streaming}} service Twitch {{launched its}} Twitch Creative channel with a marathon of The Joy of Painting. I watched as Bob Ross followed a simple procedure {{to create an}} endless succession of paintings. Users in the comments section completed the stream through a parallel engagement with form and repetition. In January 2016, I switched from watching the stream to watching one of my cats who had become suddenly and terrifyingly sick {{to the point where}} he would not eat. I searched online for a form or a bank of words to help me process my anxiety and found, among other things, a passing reference to Erysichthon from Ovid’s Metamorphoses. More generally, I’m constantly reading (into) the cats I keep in my house and looking for a useful identification. I’m participating locally in a larger structure of the internet that makes cats into stable memes (grumpy cat, keyboard cat, long cat), which is a way to pretend that stability exists. Part of this identification is in the cat performing for others the character I interpret in it. I stream my interactions with the cat for their approval. The stream is the event and the objective. It’s not a confession (where the <b>confessional</b> <b>box</b> is made for disclosing), but a space where I promise you that you can watch me being. The event thrives on repetition: the streamer predictably fills the form of the stream and watchers participate through the timely repetitions of memes and phrases in the comments section. In the past, I have not been interested in poems that are the result of process or programs. They were easy to dismiss because all they demonstrated was that whatever arbitrary-seeming system that was created to make poems functioned as a poem-making machine. If there’s just a poem-making machine behind the poem, there’s no subjecthood to invest meaning in, which makes it more difficult to approach the poem as a significant site. In the process of writing these poems, however, the systematized process of form and repetition has become a comfort in the face of the infinite. If there are infinite potential poems, even just in English, then I have to pick from the infinite hoping to find something good when I am writing. As I approach this writing process, each poem still has the same likelihood of being (at all). Without any parameters, I find myself crippled by both choice and my desire to bring all things into the poem. In response to this, I set a system to allow the poem to appear in, just as the form of the stream creates the event of the stream. I gather the materials that I’ll make the poem from, which means a welcomed narrowing of the field in the assumption that some materials won’t work in the poem-making machine. These assumptions about adequate materials create the system [...] they pick the poem [...] and the possibilities for observing the system. So, I create the system (the poem), observe it, and then imagine that I have power over it. If the poems have knowledge of their creation, then they also have power over their creation. The system is going. We notice that it’s going. Then we have to find a way to figure out why it’s going. All we have access to explain it is how we perceive the system to be working...|$|E
