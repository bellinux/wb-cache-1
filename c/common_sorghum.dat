Canonical Discriminant Analysis (CDA) and Modeclus cluster analysis were conducted to see if the 177 accessions could form clusters based on their morphological characters, and to test the consistency of farmers ’ naming of the five most <b>common</b> <b>Sorghum</b> landraces represented by 44 accessions. Multivariate analyses grouped the 177 accessions into three clusters linked by a few phenotypic intermediate landraces. A botanical key was established for easy classification of the Sorghum crop plants grown in the study area. The number of accessions of the five most common landraces named by the farmers formed dissimilar groups, suggesting that farmers ’ naming of these Sorghum landraces are consistent.

The objective of the current study is to determine if agronomically useful alleles are present in an exotic source of sorghum (S. propinquum) by introgressing them into an elite genetic background of <b>common</b> <b>sorghum</b> through backcrossing. A total of 93 BC? S. propinquum-derived A-lines and 74 hybrids (BC? equivalents) were tested in College Station, Texas in 1998 and 1999 and compared with recurrent parent checks (or equivalent) of ATx 623 and ATx 623 *RTx 430. In the two-year combined analysis, 30 S. propinquum-derived lines (SPDLs) were significantly (p 0. 55) with SPDH height and maturities, respectively. SPDL exsertion and test weight also correlated (r> 0. 27) with SPDH exsertion and test weight, respectively. SPDL yield did not correlate with SPDH yield. The results indicate that S. propinquum-derived germplasm contains agronomically desirable alleles for grain yield and maturity. Correlation of these results with previous RFLP analysis could provide an excellent tool for identifying agronomically desirable S propinquum QTLs and for breeding program utilization...|$|E

Tannin gives a bitter taste to <b>common</b> <b>sorghums</b> but this variety tastes almost sweet. It is good to use as a flour which when mixed with wheat flour is suitable for making bread. Its sweet taste also makes it a good alternative cereal for animal feeds. The variety is drought resistant and matures in less than four months. If managed properly, harvests can reach 3, 000 kg per hectare. After the next growing season in 2002, the Uganda Seed Project should have enough seeds to distribute nationwide.

40|$|Sorghum is {{the main}} crop grown in Botswana, but despite this, its {{consumption}} seems to be declining. In order to identify constraints and opportunities for enhancing utilisation of the crop, socio-economic and market surveys were carried in selected urban and peri-urban areas. These studies showed that sorghum still remains the most consumed cereal in peri-urban areas, accounting for 74 % of total cereal consumption in these areas, but only 47 % in urban areas. Consumption of sorghum on daily basis declined from 89 % in 1982 to 75 % in 1998 in selected villages of the Southern District. The crop is consumed mainly as sorghum meal, prepared as fermented or non-fermented soft (motogo) and semi-stiff porridge (bogobe). Other <b>common</b> <b>sorghum</b> products are traditional and commercial sorghum beer (Chibuku and Power), Morvite, and extruded sorghum-soy meals (Tsabana and Tsabotlhe). Preference for these products {{is dependent on the}} age, place of origin, household size, educational level, residential area and gender of the consumer. Generally, traditionally pound sorghum flour is preferred over the commercial sorghum flour. Several commercial sorghum flour brands are available throughout the country, but their quality is very variable. Consumers defined quality in terms of colour, texture and taste, and these parameters were linked to sorghum varieties and the type of milling process. Studies revealed consumers ’ desires for “modern” products formulated from sorghum. Typical products named include bread, biscuits, pasta, “rice”, breakfast flakes and fermented beverages (mageu). This is the first study to identify consumer attitudes to sorghum foods in Botswana.

Four soil management systems (SMS) were compared, namely: 1) no tillage, 2) minimum tillage, 3) conventional tillage using a disk plow and a disk harrow, and 4) conventional using a moldboard and a disk harrow - and three CRS: system I (wheat/soybean), system II (wheat/soybean and <b>common</b> vetch/corn or <b>sorghum)</b> and system III (wheat/soybean, white oats/soybean and <b>common</b> vetch/corn or <b>sorghum).</b> This is a split-plot, randomized, complete block design with three replications.

40|$|Integration of {{structural}} genomic {{data from a}} largely assembled rice genome sequence, with phylogenetic analysis of sequence samples for many other taxa, suggests that a polyploidization event occurred ≈ 70 million years ago, before the divergence of the major cereals from one another but after the divergence of the Poales from the Liliales and Zingiberales. Ancient polyploidization and subsequent “diploidization” (loss) of many duplicated gene copies has thus shaped the genomes of all Poaceae cereal, forage, and biomass crops. The Poaceae appear to have evolved as separate lineages for ≈ 50 million years, or two-thirds of the time since the duplication event. Chromosomes that are predicted to be homoeologs resulting from this ancient duplication event account for {{a disproportionate share of}} incongruent loci found by comparison of the rice sequence to a detailed sorghum sequence-tagged site-based genetic map. Differential gene loss during diploidization may have contributed many of these incongruities. Such predicted homoeologs also account for a disproportionate share of duplicated sorghum loci, further supporting the hypothesis that the polyploidization event was <b>common</b> to <b>sorghum</b> and rice. Comparative gene orders along paleo-homoeologous chromosomal segments provide a means to make phylogenetic inferences about chromosome structural rearrangements that differentiate among the grasses. Superimposition of the timing of major duplication events on taxonomic relationships leads to improved understanding of comparative gene orders, enhancing the value of data from botanical models for crop improvement and for further exploration of genomic biodiversity. Additional ancient duplication events probably remain to be discovered in other angiosperm lineages...|$|R
40|$|Post-rainy sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) {{production}} underpins the livelihood {{of millions}} in the semiarid tropics, where the crop {{is affected by}} drought. Drought scenarios have been classified and quantified using crop simulation. In this report, variation in traits that hypothetically contribute to drought adaptation (plant growth dynamics, canopy and root water conducting capacity, drought stress responses) were virtually introgressed into the most <b>common</b> post-rainy <b>sorghum</b> genotype, {{and the influence of}} these traits on plant growth, development, and grain and stover yield were simulated across different scenarios. Limited transpiration rates under high vapour pressure deficit had the highest positive effect on production, especially combined with enhanced water extraction capacity at the root level. Variability in leaf development (smaller canopy size, later plant vigour or increased leaf appearance rate) also increased grain yield under severe drought, although it caused a stover yield trade-off under milder stress. Although the leaf development response to soil drying varied, this trait had only a modest benefit on crop production across all stress scenarios. Closer dissection of the model outputs showed that under water limitation, grain yield was largely determined by the amount of water availability after anthesis, and this relationship became closer with stress severity. All traits investigated increased water availability after anthesis and caused a delay in leaf senescence and led to a ‘stay-green’ phenotype. In conclusion, we showed that breeding success remained highly probabilistic; maximum resilience and economic benefits depended on drought frequency. Maximum potential could be explored by specific combinations of traits...|$|R

Data used for the analysis include the spatial data of climate, soil, topography and land use, and literatures relevant for sweet sorghum studies. The results show that although sweet sorghum can be planted in the majority of lands in China, the suitable unused lands for large-scale planting (unit area not less than 100 Â hm 2) are only as much as 78. 6 Â xÂ  104 Â hm 2; and the productive potentials of ethanol from these lands are 157. 1 Â xÂ  104 - 294. 6 Â xÂ  104 Â t/year, which can only meet 24. 8 - 46. 4 % of current demand for E 10 (gasoline mixed with 10 % ethanol) in China (assumption of the energy efficiency of E 10 is equivalent to that of pure petroleum).

40|$|It {{has long}} been {{suspected}} that maize {{is the product of}} an historical tetraploid event. Several observations support this possibility, including the fact that the maize genome contains duplicated chromosomal segments with colinear gene arrangements. Some of the genes from these duplicated segments have been sequenced. In this study, we examine the pattern of sequence divergence among 14 pairs of duplicated genes. We compare the pattern of divergence to patterns predicted by four models of the evolution of the maize genome—autotetraploidy, genomic allotetraploidy, segmental allotetraploidy, and multiple segmental duplications. Our analyses indicate that coalescent times for duplicated sequences fall into two distinct groups, corresponding to roughly 20. 5 and 11. 4 million years. This observation strongly discounts the possibility that the maize genome {{is the product of a}} genomic allotetraploid event, and it is also difficult to reconcile with either autotetraploidy or multiple independent segmental duplications. However, the presence of two (and only two) coalescent times is predicted by the segmental allotetraploid model. If the maize genome is the product of a segmental allotetraploid event, as these data suggest, then its two diploid progenitors diverged roughly 20. 5 million years ago (Mya), and the allotetraploid event probably occurred approximately 11. 4 Mya.

We {{show that the}} stay-green drought adaptation trait enhances sorghum grain yield under post-anthesis drought in these three regions. A positive relationship between stay-green and yield was generally found in breeding trials in north-eastern Australia that sampled 1668 unique hybrid combinations and 23 environments. Physiological studies in Australia also found that introgressing four individual stay-green (Stg 1 – 4) quantitative trait loci (QTLs) into a senescent background reduced water demand before flowering and hence increased water supply during grain filling, resulting in higher grain yield relative to the senescent control. Studies in India found that various Stg QTLs affected both transpiration and transpiration efficiency, although these effects depended on the interaction between genetic background (S 35 and R 16) and individual QTLs. The yield variation unexplained by harvest index was related to transpiration efficiency in S 35 (R 2 = 0. 29) and R 16 (R 2 = 0. 72), and was related to total water extracted in S 35 (R 2 = 0. 41) but not in R 16. Finally, sixty-eight stay-green enriched lines were evaluated in six countries in sub-Saharan Africa during the 2013 / 14 season. Analysis of the data from Kenya indicates that stay-green and grain size were positively correlated at two sites: Kiboko (high yielding, r 2 = 0. 25) and Masongaleni (low yielding, r 2 = 0. 37). Together, these studies suggest that stay-green is a beneficial trait for sorghum production in the semi-arid tropics and {{is a consequence of}} traits altering the plant water budget...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} during one year to evaluate the carcass and meat quality parameters in Italian strains of Muscovy and Common ducks fed ad libitum with diets containing sorghum. In the 1 st trial, three experimental diets were formulated using corn, corn with high tannin sorghum and high tannin sorghum, as cereal base. In the 2 nd trial, three experimental diets were formulated using corn, low tannin sorghum, and low tannin sorghum with high tannin sorghum as cereal base; the diets containing sorghum were supplemented with synthetic amino acids during starter and finisher periods. In the 1 st trial no statistical difference was observed in the leg yields and in the meat and bones weights of the leg. The highest value of muscles to bones ratio was observed in ducks fed high tannin sorghum. In the 2 nd trial, Muscovy ducks fed low tannin sorghum with high tannin sorghum resulted in lower weights of the leg bones (not significant), and higher weights of the leg muscles (P< 0. 05) with consequent better muscles to bones ratio (P< 0. 05) than Muscovy ducks fed the other diets. In the 1 st and in the 2 nd trial Muscovy ducks fed sorghum based diets showed the highest thawing losses of the leg, (P< 0. 05 and P< 0. 01, respectively). The breast muscles thawing losses showed contrary but not significant trends. Only in the 1 st trial the water holding capacity of the breast muscles was lower in sorghum based diets (P< 0. 05). In the 2 nd trial <b>Common</b> ducks fed <b>sorghum</b> based diets showed the highest leg thawing losses (P< 0. 05). {{the results showed that}} sorghum based diets may not affect the fresh meat quality characteristics but seem to modify the quality parameters of meat submitted to physical treatments (deep freezed then thawed...|$|R
