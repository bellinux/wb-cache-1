5|$|The {{building}} is formed by a composite steel and concrete frame, with various setbacks in its profile, meaning {{the upper floors}} are much smaller in area than lower levels. Outrigger trusses {{at the top of}} the building and at the various setbacks help to stiffen the building's reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>core</b> against the strong winds prevalent in the area. The base of the building features a small park, for which the tower is named.|$|E
5|$|On August 16, 2008, {{construction}} crews {{made the}} last major concrete pour to top off the Trump tower's <b>concrete</b> <b>core,</b> which was commemorated with an unofficial ceremony. To celebrate the milestone, a yellow tower crane raised a bucket full of concrete and an American flag to the rooftop of the skyscraper. Another ceremony occurred on August 19, when construction supervisors, structural engineers and company representatives from McHugh Construction made a minor concrete pour {{at the top of}} the Trump tower. Though Donald Trump was absent from both of these ceremonies, he, Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric Trump attended the topping off party on September 24, 2008. Original plans called for the windows to be completed and the spire erected in October 2008. However, the spire installation was delayed through high winds in December 2008, and was finally completed on January 3, 2009. Kamin's critical opinion is that the spire is not aesthetically complementary.|$|E

25|$|The most {{frequent}} dam types were earth- or rock-filled embankment dams and masonry gravity dams. These served {{a wide array}} of purposes, such as irrigation, flood control, river diversion, soil-retention, or a combination of these functions. The impermeability of Roman dams was increased by the introduction of waterproof hydraulic mortar and especially opus caementicium in the Concrete Revolution. These materials also allowed for bigger structures to be built, like the Lake Homs Dam, possibly the largest water barrier today, and the sturdy Harbaqa Dam, both of which consist of a <b>concrete</b> <b>core.</b>|$|E

500|$|The 58-story Trump Tower is [...] high, {{making it}} the 64th tallest {{building}} in New York City. The tower, designed by Der Scutt of Poor, Swanke, Hayden & Connell, is a reinforced concrete shear wall core structure and, {{at the time of}} its completion, was the tallest structure of its type in the city. The 28-sided structure, with a stepped facade, was intended to give the tower more window exposure. A concrete hat-truss at the top of the building, similar to one used in the Trump World Tower, ties exterior columns with the <b>concrete</b> <b>core.</b> This hat-truss increases the effective dimensions of the core to that of the building which allows the building to resist the overturning of lateral forces such as those caused by wind, minor earthquakes, and other impacts perpendicular to the building's height.|$|E
500|$|The curved design offered {{two major}} {{benefits}} {{to the structure of}} the building. [...] First, curved designs, such as that found in Calatrava's Turning Torso in Malmö, Sweden, tend to add to the strength of a structure. [...] A similar principle has been used in the past with curved stadium roofs. [...] In addition to structural support, the curved face of the exterior would minimize wind forces. [...] In rectangular buildings, a fluid wind flow puts pressure on the windward face of the building; while air moves around it, a suction is applied to the leeward face. [...] This often causes a sway in tall buildings usually counteracted, at least partially, by stiffening the structure or by using a dynamic wind damper. [...] Since the curved design of the Chicago Spire would not completely negate wind forces, a tapering <b>concrete</b> <b>core</b> and twelve shear walls radiating from it were planned to counteract the remaining wind load.|$|E

40|$|The {{transport}} of ions {{related to the}} penetration of chlorides into concrete has been studied in the field by drilling 100 -mm <b>concrete</b> <b>cores</b> from a marine bridge column. A 4 -year-old concrete column in Sweden was selected. The concrete was of high quality (i. e., frost- and sulfate-resistant, with a low-heat, low-alkali portland cement with a maximum water-cement ratio of 0. 40) according to new Swedish recommendations. <b>Concrete</b> <b>cores</b> were drilled from the submerged, splash, and atmospheric zones. Selective grinding from the concrete surface(profile grinding) revealed concentration profiles of acid-soluble chlorides, carbonates, sulfates, and water-soluble alkalies. Selected parts of the concrete surface were examined by SEM and thin-section microscopy for microstructural studies. Laboratory estimates of chloride diffusivities were carried out on 6 -month-old laboratory concrete of similar mix proportions, and also on unexposed parts of drilled <b>concrete</b> <b>cores.</b> Chloride diffusivities obtained from laboratory exposure were then compared with the values obtained from the field concentration profiles, from both the bridge column and a field station, using Fick's second law of diffusion. Maximum chloride diffusivities calculated from the field profiles after 4 years of exposure were more than ten times lower than those obtained from the same concrete in the laboratory. Clearly, there are important mechanistic problems associated with laboratory procedures, resulting in serious misjudgments, if such laboratory tests are used for linear extrapolation of the service life for marine concretes. ...|$|R

The braces are also encased in concrete and steel to further mitigate risk of buckling and strength loss. Also of note is the controlled-rocking system which features vertical post-tensioning which runs the height of the building through ducts within the reinforced-concrete shear-wall core. Many of these technologies used in the One Rincon Hill South Tower have never before been applied in the United States.|$|E

40|$|Concrete {{structures}} {{may be at}} risk {{to deteriorate}} by alkali-silica reaction (ASR), when they are maintained under the conditions supporting the reaction. This reaction causes the expansion of concrete and generates microcracking in the interior part and macrocracking on the surface of concrete. This transformation can lead to serious durability problems in concrete structures, which decrease their technical and economical management. The aim {{of this study is to}} monitor the damage due to ASR progression using mechanical and nondestructive tests on specimens of various scales: mortars, laboratory <b>concrete</b> and <b>cores</b> collected from a large hydraulic structure. Two Canadian crushed aggregates were used: Spratt limestone as a reactive aggregate and Limeridge limestone as a non-reactive aggregate. Two mortars and two concretes were made from these aggregates. Mortars were made according to Canadian standard CSA A 23. 2 - 25 A and stored at 38 [degré]C in 1 molar NaOH, solution and concretes were made and stored at 38 [degré]C in humid air (R. H> 90 %) according to Canadian standard CSA A 23. 2 - 14 A. Also two types of <b>concrete</b> <b>cores</b> containing reactive aggregates (siliceous clayey limestone and Potsdam sandstone) from two concrete locks affected by ASR were kept at 38 [degré]Cin 1 molar NaOH solution. Expansion and mass variation of all specimens were measured regularly during the reaction evolution. In a first step, the properties of aggregates were characterized and their reactive silica content was measured. Non-destructive test methods were based on measurement of ultrasonic pulse velocity and resonant frequencies (longitudinal and transversal) of mortar, <b>concrete</b> and <b>concrete</b> <b>cores.</b> Also some other investigations were performed on the specimens: compressive and tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, non linear acoustic test, petrographic analysis by SEM and Damage Rating Index measurement. The main observations and recommendations are: (1) Measurement of elastic modulus of elasticity is the best mechanical test to assessing ASR damage in concrete. (2) The relation was observed between the expansion of mortars and the variation in its petrography features. (3) There was a good relationship between expansion and the degree of damage associated by ASR in <b>concrete</b> and <b>concrete</b> <b>cores</b> assessed by Damage Rating Index method. (4) Measurement of non linear parameters and resonant frequencies are the best nondestructive techniques for assessing ASR progression. A direct correlation was shown between the expansion of <b>concrete</b> <b>cores</b> and the reduction of dynamic modulus and increasing the nonlinear parameters...|$|R
500|$|The {{monument}} is {{endangered by}} the climate (which has caused damage by frost and rain) and by air pollution. Although in 1990 {{the area around}} the monument was pedestrianized, there are still three streets carrying traffic around it. High concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide have been recorded near the monument, which in combination with water cause corrosion of the fabric of the monument. In addition, water has caused cracking of the reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>core</b> and rusting of its steel reinforcements and the fastenings of the monument, which also have been worn out by constant vibrations caused by traffic. [...] The porous travertine has gradually crumbled over time and its pores have filled with soot and particles of sand, causing it to blacken and providing a habitat for small organisms, such as moss and lichens. Irregular maintenance and the unskillful performance of restoration work have also contributed to the weathering of the monument. To prevent its further decay some of the fastenings were replaced with polyurethane filler and water repellent was applied to the monument during the restoration in 2001. It was also determined that maintenance should be carried out every 2 years.|$|E
