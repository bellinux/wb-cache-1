5|$|Parents of {{children}} with Asperger syndrome can typically trace differences in their children's development to as early as 30 months of age. Developmental screening during a routine <b>check-up</b> by a general practitioner or pediatrician may identify signs that warrant further investigation. The United States Preventive Services Task Force in 2016 found it was unclear if screening was beneficial or harmful among children in whom there are no concerns.|$|E
5|$|Ralf Schumacher {{suffered}} a three-inch gash {{on his left}} calf. He was taken to Princess Grace Hospital for a routine <b>check-up</b> and his cut was stitched. Ralf Schumacher was later cleared to race in the next Grand Prix, two weeks later. He {{said that he had}} no prior indication of where his injuries originated from. Williams had their test driver Bruno Junqueira to fill in for Ralf Schumacher should the need arise.|$|E
5|$|Tommy Brockless (Anthony Lewis) {{is a young}} World War I soldier, shell-shocked {{from his}} {{experiences}} in the trenches. In 1918, Torchwood agents Gerald Carter and Harriet Derbyshire (Roderic Culver and Siobhan Hewlett) take Tommy from the St Teilo's military hospital in Cardiff {{to be kept in}} cryonic storage. They leave instructions for future Torchwood members that Tommy will one day be key to saving the world. In the present day it is revealed that Torchwood have kept Tommy in storage for almost a century, releasing him one day a year for a medical <b>check-up.</b>|$|E

40|$|A few {{preventive}} {{activities were}} recorded in Croatian family medicine (FM) from 1995 until 2003, and then in 2004, additional fee-for-service reimbursement for general <b>check-ups</b> for people aged 45 to 65 years was introduced. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the trends in preventive activities before and after the introduction of those measures by using the Croatian Health Service Yearbooks for 1995 - 2012 as the main database. Data on the number of preventive, general, and total number of <b>check-ups</b> were collected. The results showed that the total number of <b>check-ups</b> registered in FM was low, suggesting that the additional reimbursement did not bring any improvements. In fact, the trend in the number decreased after 2004. These results are not unexpected because of the ineffectiveness of general <b>check-ups</b> as indicated in the literature. General <b>check-ups</b> should be replaced by targeted preventive interventions with evidence-based effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|The {{privatization}} of gynecological {{services and the}} introduction of additional reimbursements to capitation fees are ongoing mini reforms in Croatia. In order to evaluate the outcomes of this, study was performed with the main aim of determining trends in preventive activities carried out in public and private gynecological practices from 1995 to 2012. The Croatian Health Service Yearbooks served as the basis for data collection. Data were collected on the number of general <b>check-ups,</b> the number of targeted <b>check-ups,</b> and the number of follow-up <b>check-ups.</b> The results indicate a trend of continuous {{decline in the number of}} general and follow-up <b>check-ups,</b> as well as breast examinations and Pap smears, in public gynecological practices even after the introduction of contractual obligations and additional reimbursements and fee-for-service payments. One important note is that many resources were invested in general <b>checks-up</b> interventions, which proved to be ineffective, while fewer resources were invested in the more effective Pap smear interventions...|$|R
5|$|The {{session was}} {{disrupted}} when Nakajima {{drove into the}} back-end of Jarvis's car heading into Les Combes corner. Nakajima was unable to see Jarvis because of heavy spray reducing visibility on the Kemmel straight. Nakajima complained of severe back pain and was transported to Verviers hospital where a <b>check-up</b> found he had fractured vertebra. He was deemed unfit {{to take part in}} the race. Toyota's test and reserve driver Kamui Kobayashi was in Japan and unavailable, so the No. 1 car ran as a two-driver operation for the remainder of the event weekend. It missed the second practice session because it required monocoque rebuilding. The No. 8 Audi also missed the second practice session because it was undergoing rear-end repairs.|$|E
5|$|After {{repeated}} {{attempts to}} reach Derek on his phone, Sharon finds Derek {{at the hospital}} and suspects that he and Lisa had an affair, as Lisa claims. LAPD Detective Monica Reese (Christine Lahti) at first questions Derek's fidelity to Sharon as well, but soon becomes skeptical of Lisa's claims, due to inconsistencies in her side of the story, and informs Derek of her belief in him. Sharon, refusing to believe Derek, kicks him out of their house, and he moves into a separate apartment. Months later, Derek and Sharon meet up for dinner and finally reconcile. Meanwhile, Lisa tricks the babysitter Samantha (Scout Taylor-Compton) into letting her in under the pretense of being one of Sharon's friends. When Derek and Sharon return home after dinner, they discover that Lisa had been in the house and seemingly abducted Derek and Sharon's infant son, Kyle (Nathan and Nicolas Myers). Derek goes to his car with the intent to pursue Lisa, only to find the baby is safely sitting in the back seat. He and Sharon immediately take Kyle to the hospital for a <b>check-up.</b> When Derek and Sharon return home from the hospital, they find Lisa has trashed their bedroom and removed Sharon's face from their family portrait. Sharon leaves a threatening voice message on Lisa's phone, and she and Derek set up a home alarm system.|$|E
5|$|Graves, {{who fell}} to second in class, went into Rivage's gravel trap with a left-front brake failure, {{causing him to}} retire. Toyota retired their No. 6 entry from the race because of an engine failure caused by an {{electrical}} fault. Smoke bellowed from the rear-end of Nakajima's Toyota upon leaving La Source and he {{went back into the}} pit lane where his mechanics worked on rectifying the problem allowing Oliver Jarvis in the No. 8 Audi to inherit the lead. Webber drove straight at the Bus Stop chicane, spun, and drove into the pit lane. Stefan Mücke, who was affected by turbocharger issues, lost control of the No. 66 Ford after one of his rear tyres was punctured, and narrowly avoided going airborne. The vehicle made heavy contact with the left-hand side barriers at Raidillon, heavily damaging the front-end and removing both of its doors, as well as littering debris onto the circuit. His car stopped in the centre of the track, causing the No. 2 Porsche to swerve to avoid hitting the vehicle, and the safety car was deployed to allow marshals to repair the heavily damaged tyre barrier. Drivers were instructed to steer onto the right-hand side of the track at Eau Rouge because the stranded car blocked the turn. Mücke was transported to the track's medical centre and later taken to the local hospital for a precautionary <b>check-up</b> because of bruising.|$|E
40|$|The early {{diagnosis}} {{of patients with}} TB disease is critical after an outbreak of tuberculosis (TB) infection in healthcare facilities. In this study, we report a catastrophic TB outbreak in a psychiatric healthcare facility and analyze the role of regular sputum <b>check-ups</b> and other diagnostic tools to facilitate an {{early diagnosis}}. Every exposed participant received regular sputum <b>check-ups</b> and chest X-rays (CXR) {{as part of the}} outbreak management protocol. We retrospectively analyzed data from the contact participants to identify risk factors for eventual TB development and investigated the diagnostic efficacy of regular sputum <b>check-ups.</b> Among 133 contact participants, 16 (12. 0 %) developed TB during the 4 -year follow-up period. Low body-mass-index (BMI) (3 months) (aHR 8. 70, 95 % CI, 1. 14 - 63. 34) independently predicted the development of TB. Even though regular sputum <b>check-ups</b> required significant resources, they did facilitate the early identification of new TB cases among the contact participants. Regular sputum <b>check-ups</b> for high-risk patients based on BMI, contact duration and CXR findings may be a practical approach when compared with universal sputum follow-up, with a slightly decreased sensitivity but high positive likelihood ratio (88 %, [95 % CI, 62 - 98 %] and 5. 12, [95 %CI, 3. 30 - 7. 95], respectively). While regular sputum <b>check-ups</b> for all contact participants facilitated the early identification of cases after the outbreak of TB in the healthcare facility, regular sputum <b>check-ups</b> for high-risk patients might be an effective alternative in resource-limited settings...|$|R

5|$|Initial weather {{forecasts}} predicted rain for the Thursday qualifying sessions, but {{it failed}} to materialise. The teams had two full sessions of clear but hot and humid conditions. Nick Tandy's Porsche led the session with a three minutes and 18.862 seconds lap, but remained in third position on the provisional grid. Audi No. 7 {{was the only other}} car to put in an improved lap time amongst the top ten cars. TDS Racing was the fastest LMP2 car in the session with a three minutes and 40.441 seconds yet still over two seconds behind the pole time of KCMG. The LMGTE categories also remained much the same, as Aston Martin still occupied the top four qualifying positions. Twice the session was stopped for heavy accidents, first for the No. 55 AF Corse Ferrari of Duncan Cameron who became stuck in a gravel trap for about fifteen minutes. The second stoppage occurred when Jan Magnussen suffered a mechanical failure in his No. 63 Chevrolet Corvette C7.R and hit the barriers twice in the Porsche Curves. Repairs to the barriers forced the cancellation of the remainder of the session, although half an hour was added to the final qualifying session. Magnussen was transported to the track's medical centre for a <b>check-up</b> and later released by the race organiser's medical staff. The Corvette was unable to be repaired and the team was forced to withdraw from the race because they did not bring a spare chassis to Le Mans.|$|E
5|$|Kurt Busch's right-front tire exploded, {{causing him}} to hit the wall between turns three and four, and the tenth caution was shown on lap 256. Kurt Busch retired from the race because of his crash. He was transported to the infield medical center for a {{mandatory}} <b>check-up.</b> Edwards remained in the lead for the lap-262 restart. Earnhardt spun his tires, forcing Kenseth onto the outside lane and Gordon to the inside where he passed Earnhardt. Kenseth moved in front of Earnhardt and then made contact with Gordon, who was sent into the inside backstretch retaining wall, which had no SAFER barrier installed. Gordon's car's radiator flew out from its chassis and {{into the path of}} oncoming traffic. Kenseth slid but was able to straighten his car and continue. The final caution was initially waved before a red-flag was shown, which stopped the race to allow officials to remove debris from the track. The race resumed 17 minutes later, with Edwards leading Earnhardt and Biffle. Edwards maintained the lead for the remaining two laps to secure his second consecutive win and the ninth of his career. Earnhardt finished second, ahead of Biffle in third place, Harvick in fourth, and Burton in fifth. Ragan, Kahne, Kvapil, Hamlin, and Martin rounded out the top ten finishers. The race had eleven cautions and nineteen lead changes among nine drivers. Edwards led four times for a total of 86 laps, more than any other competitor.|$|E
