500|$|In economics, a consumer's {{preferences}} are defined over all [...] "baskets" [...] <b>of</b> goods. Each <b>basket</b> is {{represented as a}} non-negative vector, whose coordinates represent the quantities of the goods. On this set <b>of</b> <b>baskets,</b> an indifference curve is defined for each consumer; a consumer's indifference curve contains all the <b>baskets</b> <b>of</b> commodities that the consumer regards as equivalent: That is, for every pair <b>of</b> <b>baskets</b> on the same indifference curve, the consumer does not prefer one basket over another. Through each <b>basket</b> <b>of</b> commodities passes one indifference curve. A consumer's preference set (relative to an indifference curve) is the union of the indifference curve and all the commodity baskets that the consumer prefers over the indifference curve. A consumer's {{preferences are}} convex if all such preference sets are convex.|$|R

This price is an upper bound on the prices <b>of</b> the <b>basket</b> option which are consistent with no-arbitrage.
