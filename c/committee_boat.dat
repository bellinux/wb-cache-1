25|$|In yacht racing, flags {{are used}} to {{communicate}} information from the race <b>committee</b> <b>boat</b> to the racers. Different flags hoisted from the <b>committee</b> <b>boat</b> may communicate a false start, changes in the course, a cancelled race, or other important information. Racing boats themselves may also use flags to symbolize a protest or distress. The flags are often part of the nautical alphabetic system of International maritime signal flags, in which 26 different flags designate the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet.|$|E
2500|$|The {{competitors}} {{had been}} waiting on the water for close to four hours. As the 16:30 deadline for starting a race approached, Bennett ordered the postponement to be taken down indicating that a race starting sequence would soon commence. The SNG Race Committee refused to follow this direction, and left the bridge, moving below decks. In order to continue Bennett had to ask Tom Ehman, the BOR representative on board the <b>committee</b> <b>boat</b> plus a support boat driver {{to assist with the}} raising and lowering of flags to complete the start sequence.

5000|$|The <b>Committee</b> <b>Boat</b> often {{occupies}} {{one end of}} {{the starting}} line. Through the use of flags, signals, guns and VHF radio, people aboard the <b>committee</b> <b>boat</b> will count down through the [...] "starting sequence" [...] and begin the race. If there are multiple fleets participating in a regatta, each fleet will have their own starting sequence, noted {{through the use of a}} [...] "class flag".The <b>committee</b> <b>boat</b> will also make sure no boats have crossed the starting line early, and will signal over-early boats. A boat which was over early and did not make amends (usually by coming back to the starting line, or by going around {{one end of the}} starting line) will be penalized in the scoring process.At the end of a race, the <b>committee</b> <b>boat</b> will write down finish-times. If the regatta has multiple races, the <b>committee</b> <b>boat</b> will begin the starting sequence for the next race, after all the boats have finished the previous race.|$|E

2500|$|After {{a period}} of disuse {{following}} nationalisation in 1948, the first suggestions that the canal and others should be restored {{were made by the}} newly formed Inland Waterways Protection Society (IWPS) in 1959. However, the British Transport Commission presented their annual Bill in 1961, in which the Dudley Canal and Tunnel were scheduled to be closed immediately, with no provision to safeguard the route for future restoration. Both the Inland Waterways Association and the IWPS protested, but the protests were ignored, and closure occurred in 1962. [...] Despite this, the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal Society explored the tunnel in mid-1963, after which a Dudley Tunnel <b>Committee</b> began running <b>boat</b> trips through it. These proved popular, and the Committee became the Dudley Canal Tunnel Preservation Society on 1 January 1964, eventually becoming the Dudley Canal Trust in 1970.|$|R

5000|$|The {{starting}} line often has a bias {{to the port}} end (the left end as one looks up the course towards the top mark) of 5 to 10 degrees towards the top mark from what the start line would be if it was straight across the wind direction. This bias encourages competitors {{to move to the}} pin end of the line as it is further up the wind towards the top mark. It also provides [...] "cleaner" [...] air to competitors on the port end of the line. With many competitors moving to the pin or port end of the line to be further to windward, there is room for the other competitors to form up along the line, and although they may be further down the wind from the top mark, they are more easily able to tack onto port tack should the wind shift or to get clear air. If there is no bias favouring the pin end, or more particularly if the starboard (<b>committee</b> <b>boat)</b> end is favoured (further to windward), competitors will be encouraged to avoid being on the line away from the <b>committee</b> <b>boat</b> and so the <b>committee</b> <b>boat</b> area becomes very congested and most competitors are not on the start line and do not start until some time after the starting signal as they have been queued up in the area to starboard of the starboard end of the line. Boats generally approach the {{starting line}} on starboard tack to maintain right of way over boats on port tack.|$|E

500|$|In July 1971, a {{group called}} the Committee for Nuclear Responsibility filed suit against the AEC, asking the court to stop the test. The suit was unsuccessful, with the Supreme Court denying the {{injunction}} by 4 votes to 3, and Richard Nixon personally authorized the $200 million test, in spite of objections from Japan, Peru, and Sweden. [...] "What the Court didn’t know, however, was that six federal agencies, including the departments of State and Interior, and the fledgling EPA, had lodged serious objections to the Cannikin test, ranging from environmental and health concerns to legal and diplomatic problems. Nixon issued an executive order to keep the comments from being released." [...] The Don't Make A Wave <b>Committee</b> chartered a <b>boat,</b> in which they had intended to sail to the island in protest, but due to weather conditions they were unable to reach their destination.|$|R
6000|$|In 1789, {{the public}} were roused from their state of apathy {{in regard to}} shipwrecked seamen by {{the wreck of the}} [...] "Adventure" [...] of Newcastle, the crew of which perished in the {{presence}} of thousands who could do nothing to save them. Under the excitement of this disaster the inhabitants of South Shields met to deplore and to consult. A committee was appointed, and premiums were offered for the best models of lifeboats. Men came forward, and two stood pre-eminent--Mr William Wouldhave, a painter, and Mr Henry Greathead, a boat-builder, of South Shields. The former seems to have been the first who had a glimmering idea of the self-righting principle, but he never brought it to anything. Cork was the buoyant principle in his boat. Greathead suggested a curved keel. The chairman of the <b>committee</b> modelled a <b>boat</b> in clay which combined several of the good qualities of each, and this was given to Greathead as the type of the boat he was to build.|$|R
50|$|The {{community}} dragon <b>boat</b> <b>committee</b> {{contacted the}} Hong Kong Tourist Association (now the Hong Kong Tourism Board) {{who had been}} organizing the 'Hong Kong Dragon Boat Festival - International Races' since 1976 {{as a kind of}} sport tourism property. With the financial assistance of three key corporate sponsors with connections to Hong Kong's business community (Cathay Pacific Airways, Sing Tao media and Empire Stevedoring), they arranged to have six teak wooden dragon boats along with sets of paddles, drums, steering oars and lau san or ceremonial parasols built in Hong Kong to the local design pattern of the Pearl River Delta region fishermen of southern China and shipped over to Vancouver in time for Expo 86. These boats were on display afloat and tied up at the Marine Plaza zone throughout the world's fair when they were not being used for team practices, competitions or ceremonial purposes in support of the Hong Kong Pavilion that summer.|$|R
50|$|The most {{flexible}} way to set {{the finishing}} line is to windward of the top mark, using a finishing mark and the <b>committee</b> <b>boat</b> as {{either end of the}} line. Generally the top mark should be ignored on the beat from the bottom mark to the finish, even if the top mark is left in place. The advantage of this configuration is that the finish line can be laid late in the race and laid so that the final work is a true beat - the line from the bottom mark to the centre of the finish line should be directly to windward.|$|E
50|$|The San Diego Yacht Club Junior Sailing Program {{has evolved}} into a year-round intense {{training}} program affecting around 200 youth sailors every year. The Junior Program consists of a full-time junior program director, coaches, maintenance and administrative staff.

5000|$|Dinghys {{typically}} race {{around a}} windward-leeward race course. There is a start/finish [...] "line", set up {{perpendicular to the}} wind, marked by a <b>committee</b> <b>boat</b> at one end, and a buoy on the other. At the end of five minutes, competitors are allowed to cross the line and begin to race to the next mark. The next mark is called the windward mark. The windward mark is placed directly upwind from the start/finish line. Competitors must round the mark going counter-clockwise. After rounding the windward mark, the fleet now heads towards the leeward mark. The leeward mark is positioned directly downwind from the windward mark, below the start/finish line. Sailors also round this mark counter-clockwise. After rounding, competitors head upwind to cross the finish line.|$|E
50|$|G. V. Raja invited Wimbledon {{champion}} Bill Tilden to play {{an exhibition}} match on 30 January 1938 to popularise Tennis in the state. Following this, he founded the Trivandrum Tennis Club on 1 February 1938 at Shasthamangalam. G. V. Raja {{was the president of}} Kerala Cricket Association from 1950 to 1963. He became the first person from Kerala to become an office-holder of BCCI Board of Control for Cricket in India when he became its Vice President.

He was instrumental in organizing the Asian Cup qualifying round tournament, involving Israel, Iran, Pakistan and India, at the Maharaja’s College Grounds, Ernakulam in 1959 and had spearheaded a team of organizers in hosting the Santosh Trophy for the first time in Kerala in 1956.|$|R
40|$|Competitive sailing is characterised by {{continuous}} interdependencies {{of decisions}} and actions. All actions imply a permanent {{monitoring of the}} environmental conditions, such as intensity {{and direction of the}} wind, sea characteristics, and the behaviour of the opponent sailors. These constraints on sailors’ behavior are in constant change implying continuous adjustments in sailors’ actions and decisions. Among the different parts of a regatta, tactics and strategy at the start are particularly relevant. Among coaches there is an adage that says that “the start is 50 % of a regatta” (Houghton, 1984; Saltonstall, 1983 / 1986). Olympic sailing regattas are performed with boats of the same class, by one, two or three sailors, depending on the boat class. Normally before the start, sailors visit the racing venue and analyse wind and sea characteristics, in order to fine- tune their boats accordingly. Then, five minutes before the start, sailors initiate starting procedures in order to be in a favourable position at the starting line (at the “second zero”). This position is selected during the start period according to wind shifts tendencies and the actions of other boats (Figure 11. 1). Only after the start signal can the boats cross the imaginary starting line between the race <b>committee</b> signal <b>boat</b> “A” and the pin end boat. The start takes place against the wind (upwind), and the boats start racing in the direction of mark 1. Based on the evaluation of the sea and wind characteristics (e. g. if the wind is stronger at a particular place on the course), sailors re- adjust their strategy for the regatta. This strategy may change during the regatta, according to wind changes and adversary actions. More to the point, strategic decisions constrain and are constrained by on- line decisions during the regatta...|$|R
50|$|John Coggeshall Jr. (c. 1624 - 1 October 1708) was {{a deputy}} {{governor}} of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. The son of Rhode Island President John Coggeshall Sr., {{he was raised in}} the village of Castle Hedingham in northeastern Essex where his father was a merchant. Aged about eight, he sailed from England with his parents and surviving siblings, arriving in New England in 1632. He was first active in civil affairs in 1653 when he became treasurer of the island towns of Portsmouth and Newport. The following year brought the re-unification of the colony, with the island towns rejoining the government with Providence and Warwick, and he served as treasurer of the four towns for a year. His name appears on a list of Newport freemen in 1655, and for the following 35 years he served almost continuously in one or multiple roles including Assistant, General Treasurer, Deputy, General Recorder, and Major for the Island. He was one of ten Assistants named in the Royal Charter of 1663, which would become the basis for Rhode Island's government for nearly two centuries. In 1686 he became the Deputy Governor under Governor Walter Clarke, but his term lasted only a month when the English crown assigned Edmund Andros to be Governor of all the New England colonies under the Dominion of New England. Following the demise of this dominion and the arrest of Andros in 1689, Coggeshall was once again selected as Deputy Governor for the year ending in May 1690, serving under Governor Henry Bull. In April 1676, during King Philip's War, he was on a <b>committee</b> to procure <b>boats</b> for the colony's defense. Later that year, in August, {{he was a member of}} a court martial for the trial of several Indians.|$|R
