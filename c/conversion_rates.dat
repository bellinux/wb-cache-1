Excess ammonia may accumulate and cause alteration of metabolism or increases in the body pH of the exposed organism. Tolerance varies among fish species. At lower concentrations, around 0.05mg/L, un-ionised ammonia is harmful to fish species and can result in poor growth and feed <b>conversion</b> <b>rates,</b> reduced fecundity and fertility and increase stress and susceptibility to bacterial infections and diseases. Exposed to excess ammonia, fish may suffer loss of equilibrium, hyper-excitability, increased respiratory activity and oxygen uptake and increased heart rate. At concentrations exceeding 2.0mg/L, ammonia causes gill and tissue damage, extreme lethargy, convulsions, coma, and death. Experiments have shown that the lethal concentration for a variety of fish species ranges from 0.2 to 2.0mg/l.|$|E

2500|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognized}} that the huge supply of agricultural cellulose, the lignocellulosic material {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "Nature's polymer", would be an ideal source of material for biofuels and many other products. Composed of lignin and monomer sugars such as glucose, fructose, arabinose, galactose, and xylose, these constituents are very valuable in their own right. To this point in history, there are some methods commonly used to coax [...] "recalcitrant" [...] cellulose to separate or hydrolyse into its lignin and sugar parts, treatment with; steam explosion, supercritical water, enzymes, acids and alkalines. All these methods involve heat or chemicals, are expensive, have lower <b>conversion</b> <b>rates</b> and produce waste materials. In recent years the rise of [...] "mechanochemistry" [...] has resulted in the use of ball mills and other mill designs to reduce cellulose to a fine powder {{in the presence of a}} catalyst, a common bentonite or kaolinite clay, that will hydrolyse the cellulose quickly and with low energy input into pure sugar and lignin. Still currently only in pilot stage, this promising technology offers the possibility that any agricultural economy might be able to get rid of its requirement to refine oil for transportation fuels. This would be a major improvement in carbon neutral energy sources and allow the continued use of internal combustion engines on a large scale.|$|E

40|$|Knowledge {{concerning}} the <b>conversion</b> <b>rate</b> of tritium gas to tritiated {{water in the}} environment is basic data needed for estimating the risk of exposure to tritium gas. The <b>conversion</b> <b>rate</b> is affected by {{various factors such as}} the tritium concentration, dust and moisture in the atmosphere, bacteria in the soil, and solar rays, etc. However, the influence of solar rays on the <b>conversion</b> <b>rate</b> has not been investigated hitherto. From this viewpoint, we examined the influence of ultra-violet (UV) irradiation on the <b>conversion</b> <b>rate</b> of room temperature. The reaction vessel (RV) {{used in the present study}} was spherical flask made of Pyrex or quartz. A given amount of the mixture of oxygen and tritium diluted with hydrogen was introduced into the RV and then UV-irradiation was carried out. The partial pressure of the tritium gas was kept constant at 0. 6 Torr (5 μCi/ml) and the oxygen pressure was varied from 20 to 160 Torr. A high pressure mercury lamp was used as a light source. The <b>conversion</b> <b>rate</b> was determined by the amount of the tritiated water formed. This was measured by a liquid scintillation counter. Only tritium gas was introduced to clarify the contribution of the exchange reaction with the trace amount of water in the RV, however, little tritiated water was formed. The initial <b>conversion</b> <b>rate</b> of the gas mixture without UV-irradiation was of an order of magnitude of 0. 01 %/day, which corresponded to the tritium decay rate. From these results, it was revealed that the exchange rate of tritium gas with the water adsorbed on inner wall of the RV was negligibly small in comparison to the <b>conversion</b> <b>rate,</b> and that most of the tritiated water formed came from the β-radiation-induced oxidation. In addition, it was observed that with UV-irradiation the <b>conversion</b> <b>rate</b> was about 1000 times greater than that of nonirradiation. In particular, wave lengths ranging from 200 to 300 nm were effective for converting tritium gas. The primary conclusion was that solar rays would play an important role in the <b>conversion</b> <b>rate</b> of tritium gas in the environment...|$|R
