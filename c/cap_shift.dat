40|$|At 16 : 40 UT on August 17 th, 2001, the IMAGE {{satellite}} was {{in position}} to view an auroral storm in the Northern Hemisphere, while the POLAR satellite was simultaneously {{in position to}} view the storm in the Southern Hemisphere. For many low-latitude auroras, the precipitation maps along field lines from the Southern Hemisphere to the Northern Hemisphere. However, in this case, the IMF {{had a very strong}} dawn-dusk component which has been shown to make the polar <b>cap</b> <b>shift</b> towards the dusk in one hemisphere and towards the dawn in the other, but this has not yet been confirmed by simultaneous auroral imaging. Using the satellite images in the 130 nm to 160 nm wavelength range, {{we have been able to}} identify the Polar Cap Boundary in both hemispheres throughout the event, and calculated the Dawn-Dusk Offset, ∆L, in both hemispheres. We then found correlations of 0. 90 in the Northern Hemisphere and 0. 83 in the Southern Hemisphere between ∆L, ranging from 4 to 12 degrees during the event, and By, ranging from 20 to 32 nT during the event. ∆L also correlated well against IMF Clock Angle (ϴC) and the Epsilon parameter (ϵ=vB 2 sin[ϴC/ 2]) when using specific time averages of these parameters. The same methods are then applied to the compute Polar Cap Boundaries in the BATSRUS, OpenGGCM, and LFM-MIX models that were run to simulate the event. We find that none of the models accurately describe the observed open-closed field line boundary during this event, with BATSRUS tending to produce boundaries that are too ideal and symmetric, OpenGGCM producing boundaries that are highly distorted and random, and the LFM-MIX model always yielding low correlations between ∆L and the various solar wind parameters...|$|E

40|$|In {{times when}} the Y-component of the IMF is dominant, {{the pull of the}} {{magnetic}} fields cause the polar caps to skew, with one <b>cap</b> <b>shifted</b> towards dusk and the other polar <b>cap</b> <b>shifted</b> towards dawn. A case with two hours of continuous dual-cap auroral imaging provides us with “ground truth” to test the amount of dawn-dusk shift predicted by commonly-used MHD models. With IMAGE/WIC observing in ultraviolet over the Earth’s sunlit northern pole and Polar/VIS over the dark southern pole, the skew is readily observed and mapped to the surface using Apex coordinates. The dawn/dusk offset for this case, measured as the difference of the colatitude of the polar cap boundary at dawn minus that at dusk, is up to ten degrees for this extreme case with By ~ 30 nT. Four MHD models have been run through the CCMC at GFSC, using the real time solar wind propagated to the models. Only the LFM model yields a skew which is comparable in size to the that observed in the imaging data. The other models predict skews which are smaller or even of the wrong sense...|$|R

40|$|We re-examine the {{characteristic}} polarization angle sweep of rotation-powered pulsars and calculate the expected deviations from this sweep caused by aberrational effects and by polar-cap current flow. We {{find that in}} addition to the previously known phase shift of the entire sweep by ∆Φ = − 4 r/RL, aberration shifts the polarization angle itself by ∆Ψ = −(10 / 3) (r/RL) cos α. Similarly, current flow above the polar <b>cap</b> <b>shifts</b> the polarization sweep by ∆Ψ = (10 / 3) (r/RL) (J/JGJ) cos α, potentially providing a method of directly measuring the magnitude of the current. The competition between these two effects produces a potentially observable signature in the polarization angle sweep. Although these effects may appear similar to orthogonal mode shifts, they are an independent phenomenon with distinct observational characteristics. 1...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAlthough {{cancer of}} the {{prostate}} (CaP) is the most commonly occurring cancer in males, there are major limitations in its diagnosis and long-term cure. Consequently, understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the progression of CaP is of particular importance for production of pharmacological and biological agents to manage the disease. The development of the normal prostate is regulated by stromal–epithelial interactions via endocrine and paracrine factors, such as androgens and growth factors, which act as precise homeostatic regulators of cellular proliferation. Importantly, {{after a period of}} hormonal therapy, <b>CaP</b> <b>shifts</b> from an androgen-dependent to an androgen-independent state with a concomitant switch from paracrine to autocrine growth factor stimulation and subsequent upregulation of growth factor expression. Thus, growth factors and their receptors have a pivotal role in CaP. This is emphasized by current evidence obtained from clinical specimens as well as several in vitro and in vivo models strongly suggesting that epidermal growth factor and the neurotrophins (nerve growth factor, brain derived neurotrophin factor, neurotrophin- 3 and neurotrophin- 4 / 5) together with their tyrosine kinase receptors could play a very significant role in CaP progression...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTrimethyltin (TMT) is an {{occupational}} {{and environmental health}} hazard behaving as a potent neurotoxin known to affect {{the central nervous system}} as well as the peripheral auditory system. However, the mechanisms underlying TMT-induced ototoxicity are poorly understood. To elucidate the effects of TMT on the cochlea, a single injection of 4 or 8  mg/kg TMT was administered intraperitoneally to adult rats. The compound action potential (CAP) threshold was used to assess the functional status of the cochlea and histological techniques were used to assess the condition of the hair cells and auditory nerve fibers. TMT at 4  mg/kg produced a temporary CAP threshold elevation of 25 – 60  dB that recovered by 28  d post-treatment. Although there was no hair cell loss with the 4  mg/kg dose, there was a noticeable loss of auditory nerve fibers particularly beneath the inner hair cells. TMT at 8  mg/kg produced a large permanent <b>CAP</b> threshold <b>shift</b> that was greatest at the high frequencies. The <b>CAP</b> threshold <b>shift</b> was associated with the loss of outer hair cells and inner hair cells in the basal, high-frequency region of the cochlea, considerable loss of auditory nerve fibers and a significant loss of spiral ganglion neurons in the basal turn. Spiral ganglion neurons showed evidence of soma shrinkage and nuclear condensation and fragmentation, morphological features of apoptotic cell death.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{a new way}} {{of reducing}} the major individual tax expenditures: capping the total amount that tax expenditures as a whole can reduce each individual's tax burden.

Simulations using the NBER TAXSIM model project that a 2 percent cap would raise $ 278 billion in 2011. The paper analyzes the revenue increases by AGI class. The 2 percent cap would also cause substantial simplification by inducing more than 35 million taxpayers to shift from itemizing their deductions to using the standard deduction. For any taxpayer for whom the 2 percent cap is binding, a cap would reduce the volume of wasteful spending and the associated deadweight loss.

5000|$|The {{premise is}} that mankind is {{actually}} alien to the planet earth. And that we came here on a quest for this ultimate knowledge that these beings called the Setians had. They were the true inhabitants of earth {{and they are the}} direct descendants of God or the grand architect of the universe. So they have all of the answers as to why things are the way they are. And human beings were after this unlimited power. So they come to planet earth and they basically wipe out the civilisation of the setians -this is all in ‘Framing Armageddon’- and that story takes place from the point of invasion up until the birth of Set. The first part is a 10.000 year period. Before the invasion, the Setians see in a prophecy {{that this is going to}} happen. So they send 10.000 of their own chosen people to go into hiding to survive the attacks of the humans. And until after this event called “the clouding” which is where the earth goes through this cataclysmic shift like the magnetic properties of the polar <b>caps</b> <b>shift</b> and volcanoes erupt and there’s earthquakes and sandstorms and the whole of earth goes haywire. At this point, the human beings believe that they have wiped out all of the Setians and they go through the days of clouding. When the days of clouding are over, they have lost their memories of where they came from and why they are here. And so this whole invasion armada that came, all the ships and other evidence has been buried in the desert. So they wake up and what was once a lush green land with water is now a desert. So the 10.000 come out of hiding after the days of clouding and they now look like human beings. Setians are humanoid anyway but they have different features, they can morph and shift and look exactly like humans. Another thing that happens after the days of clouding is like the story of the tower of Babel: the human beings that have similar skin colours can speak to each other. This creates confusion because now the white guys can talk to each other and the red guys can, but they can’t talk to guys with a different colour. Then they start to faction off. This is a way to keep people divided. It’s all part of the plan of the clouding. And when the Setians come back in and mix with humans, they take leadership positions and they spread around the planet, societies grow. But the whole time they are being manipulated by the Setian leaders. They build up the order of the Rose. This is a lodge, like a philanthropic organisation that is supposed to be different, doing good for the world and for humanity. And for the whole time they are actually plotting the destruction of mankind. Every empire that rises and falls, it all happens by their design. You could say, for instance, that the rise and fall of the Roman Empire was by the design of the Setians. And all of the religions of the world were created by the Setians as well, because all these things help keep mankind divided, they thrive on the weaknesses of man in order to bring us to our demise.|$|R
40|$|This thesis brings {{together}} three essays on {{issues in the}} economics of health insurance. The first study considers the effects of average per-patient caps on Medicare reimbursement for home health care, which took effect in October 1997. I use regional variation in the restrictiveness of per-patient caps to identify the short-run effects of this reimbursement change on home health agency behavior, beneficiary health care utilization, and health status. The empirical evidence suggests that agencies responded to the <b>caps</b> by <b>shifting</b> the composition of their caseload towards healthier beneficiaries. In addition, I find that decreases in home care utilization were associated {{with an increase in}} outpatient care, and had little adverse impact on the health status of beneficiaries. In the second paper, I examine the impact of Medicare balance billing restrictions on physician behavior and on beneficiary spending. My findings include a significant decline in out-of-pocket expenditures for medical care by elderly households, but no impact on the quantity of care received or in the duration of office visits. The third paper (written with Jonathan Gruber) explores the causes of the dramatic rise in employee contributions to employer-provided health insurance over the past 20 years. We find that there was a large impact of falling tax rates, rising eligibility for insurance through the Medicaid system and through spouses, and deteriorating economic conditions (in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s). We also find more modest impacts of increased managed care penetration and rising health care costs. Overall, this set of factors can explain about one-quarter of the rise in employee contributions over the 1982 - 1996 period. by Robin Lynn McKnight. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The {{effect of}} osmotic bias on {{cochlear}} potentials was investigated by perfusion of scala tympani with a modified artificial perilymph. The mean osmolality of the artificial perilymph was increased by around 15 % (from 303 ± 6 mOsm/kg H 2 O to 349 ± 1 mOsm/kg H 2 O) by addition of sucrose. OHC function {{was assessed using}} Boltzmann analysis of the low-frequency CM. Neural thresholds and waveforms were monitored at multiple frequencies, and spontaneous neural noise was monitored via a round-window electrode. The 2 -minute perfusions caused a 6 ± 4 % increase in the maximal CM amplitude, indicating an increase in OHC basolateral permeability, and an 8 ± 1 % increase in MET sensitivity, which may reflect a decrease in OHC axial stiffness. The operating-point shifts recorded were more variable: in healthy animals, the hyperosmotic perfusions caused initial operating point shifts towards scala vestibuli of around 1 – 2 meV that were either followed by a brief undershoot towards scala tympani, or initiated a longer-lasting scala tympani operating point shift. Nonetheless, these operating point shifts were smaller than expected, resulting in a less than ± 2 meV deviation from the starting point. Neural thresholds during the perfusion fell (by 20 – 30 dB at 22 kHz), and recovered with a time course consistent with the predicted perilymphatic sucrose concentrations at the corresponding BM place for each frequency. The mechanism of the changes observed with these hyperosmotic perfusions is not known, but its effects were not consistent with a simple movement of the reticular lamina towards scala vestibuli. Other data (Marcon and Patuzzi, in preparation) indicate the <b>CAP</b> threshold <b>shifts</b> during these perfusions are most likely mechanical in origin.

At the same time, price variability has sharply increased. Prices for EU butter increased from 209 EUR per 100  kg (= 290 USD) in January 2009 to a high of 424 EUR (= 608 USD) in July 2011 before falling back to 241 EUR (= 306 USD) in May 2012. After this trough, butter prices started to rise again with a peak of 421 EUR (= 565 USD) in September 2013, followed by a trough of 283 EUR (= 311 USD) in December 2015. This shows that price variability has become a serious problem for farmers, processors and consumers with a need for appropriate risk management tools to cope with this increased variability. While this issue has been addressed by both the private market and at EU policy level, the issue of price variability remains. The establishment of EU dairy futures by the Eurex was a positive development—however, liquidity and uptake remain low. Likewise implementation of the “Milk Package”, 1 while welcome, has had limited effect.|$|R

The optimal morphology requirements are uniform arrays with precisely controlled positions and sizes {{over a large}} area with long range ordering since this strongly affects device performance. To understand the development of gold layer nanomorphology, the detailed mechanism of structure formation are probed with time-resolved grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) during gold sputter deposition. Gold is sputtered on a CdSe quantum dot array with a characteristic quantum dot spacing of ≈ 7 nm. In {{the initial stages of}} gold nanostructure growth, a preferential deposition of gold on top of quantum dots occurs. Thus, the quantum dots act as nucleation sites for gold growth. In later stages, the gold nanoparticles surrounding the quantum dots undergo a coarsening to form a complete layer comprised of gold-dot clusters. Next, growth proceeds dominantly via vertical growth of gold on these gold-dot clusters to form an gold capping layer.

Transcription of the XPBC/ERCC- 3 gene is initiated from heterogeneous sites, with a major startpoint mapped at position - 54 (relative to the translation start codon ATG). The promoter region does not possess classical TATA and CAAT elements, but it is GC-rich and contains three putative Sp 1 -binding sites. In addition, there are two elements related to the cyclic AMP (cAMP) -response element (CRE) and the 12 -O-tetradecanoyl phorbol- 13 -acetate-response element (TRE) in the 5 '-flanking region.

30|$|Recent {{changes to}} the common {{agricultural}} policy (<b>CAP)</b> saw a <b>shift</b> to greater market orientation for the EU dairy industry. Given this reorientation, the volatility of EU dairy commodity prices has sharply increased, creating {{the need to develop}} proper risk management tools to protect farmers’ income and to ensure stable prices for processors and consumers. In addition, there is a perceived threat that these commodities may be replaced by cheaper substitutes, such as palm oil, as dairy commodity prices become more volatile. Global production of palm oil almost doubled over the last decade while butter production remained relatively flat. Palm oil also serves as a feedstock for biodiesel production, thus establishing a new link between agricultural commodities and crude oil. Price and volatility transmission effects between EU and World butter prices, as well as between butter, palm oil and crude oil prices, before and after the Luxembourg agreement, are analysed. Vector autoregression (VAR) models are applied to capture price transmission effects between these markets. These are combined with a multivariate GARCH model to account for potential volatility transmission. Results indicate strong price and volatility transmission effects between EU and World butter prices. EU butter shocks further spillover to palm oil volatility. In addition, there is evidence that oil prices spillover to World butter prices and World butter volatility.|$|R
40|$|International audienceLoops connect regular {{secondary}} structures. In many instances, {{they are}} known to play important biological roles. Analysis and prediction of loop conformations depend directly on the definition of repetitive structures. Nonetheless, the secondary structure assignment methods (SSAMs) often lead to divergent assignments. In this study, we analyzed, both structure and sequence point of views, how the divergence between different SSAMs affect boundary definitions of loops connecting regular secondary structures. The analysis of SSAMs underlines that no clear consensus between the different SSAMs can be easily found. Because these latter greatly influence the loop boundary definitions, important variations are indeed observed, that is, <b>capping</b> positions are <b>shifted</b> between different SSAMs. On the other hand, our {{results show that the}} sequence information in these capping regions are more stable than expected, and, classical and equivalent sequence patterns were found for most of the SSAMs. This is, to our knowledge, the most exhaustive survey in this field as (i) various databank have been used leading to similar results without implication of protein redundancy and (ii) the first time various SSAMs have been used. This work hence gives new insights into the difficult question of assignment of repetitive structures and addresses the issue of loop boundaries definition. Although SSAMs give very different local structure assignments capping sequence patterns remain efficiently stable...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Recent {{changes to}} the common {{agricultural}} policy (<b>CAP)</b> saw a <b>shift</b> to greater market orientation for the EU dairy industry. Given this reorientation, the volatility of EU dairy commodity prices has sharply increased, creating {{the need to develop}} proper risk management tools to protect farmers’ income and to ensure stable prices for processors and consumers. In addition, there is a perceived threat that these commodities may be replaced by cheaper substitutes, such as palm oil, as dairy commodity prices become more volatile. Global production of palm oil almost doubled over the last decade while butter production remained relatively flat. Palm oil also serves as a feedstock for biodiesel production, thus establishing a new link between agricultural commodities and crude oil. Price and volatility transmission effects between EU and World butter prices, as well as between butter, palm oil and crude oil prices, before and after the Luxembourg agreement, are analysed. Vector autoregression (VAR) models are applied to capture price transmission effects between these markets. These are combined with a multivariate GARCH model to account for potential volatility transmission. Results indicate strong price and volatility transmission effects between EU and World butter prices. EU butter shocks further spillover to palm oil volatility. In addition, there is evidence that oil prices spillover to World butter prices and World butter volatility...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the impact on the {{existing}} public private mix of the reforms undertaken in the French health care system in the past twenty years. As for financing, the system has slowly moved closer to the Beveridge model, with greater emphasis on general levy taxes in order to enhance universality and equity. For hospital funding, the reforms have fostered the development of a fairer competition between the public and private sectors by slowly aligning the private sector financing rules on those prevailing for public hospitals, in particular closed budgets and eventually, prospective payment schemes. In ambulatory care, patient driven competition between primary and secondary services has shown its limits and reforms are slowly changing the existing competitive relationships between these providers. But more structural reforms are needed to alter the incentives towards overuse in ambulatory care, particularly for drugs. Finally, the macroeconomic regulation which started in the early 90 s has taken the form of global <b>caps,</b> allowing a <b>shift</b> from an ex-post refunding of expenditure to an ex-ante target rate of increase, but it has met with a mitigated success. The high deficit estimate for 2003 will inevitably bring health care cost containment issues to the fore. 1 We would like to thank Valérie Paris for a thorough reading of earlier versions of this paper.
