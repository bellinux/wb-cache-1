40|$|The {{incidence}} of acute {{upper respiratory tract}} viral infections (URTI) is directly correlated to air temperature with most URTI occurring seasonally in cold weather. This review looks at four types of cold exposure and examines the evidence and possible mechanisms for any relationship to URTI. The effects of cold are discussed as: 1) <b>Chilling</b> <b>of</b> the nose and upper respiratory tract by breathing cold air, 2) <b>Chilling</b> <b>of</b> the mouth and upper digestive tract by ingestion of cold drinks and food, 3) Acute <b>chilling</b> <b>of</b> the body surface, and, 4) <b>Chilling</b> <b>of</b> the body as a whole with a fall in body temperature, hypothermia. Some studies were found to support a relationship between breathing cold air and chilling the body surface {{with the development of}} URTI, although this area is controversial. No evidence was found in the literature to support any relationship between ingestion of cold drinks and food and URTI, and similarly no evidence was found to link hypothermia and URTI...|$|R

25|$|In 1987, YB won the Cup for {{the sixth}} time. In the finals, it {{defeated}} Servette FC 4–2 in a replay. In {{the first round of}} the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, Young Boys traveled to Dunajská Streda, Czechoslovakia, where the Czechs won 2–1. Before 8,100 spectators, YB prevailed in Bern 3–1 and qualified for the second round. In the round of 16, the Bernese visited FC Den Haag, where it lost 1–2. In the return match in Bern, only 6,400 spectators braved the icy <b>chill</b> <b>of</b> the Wankdorf. A 1–0 YB victory was enough to progress into the quarter-finals. The next opponent was again from the Netherlands, this time Ajax of Amsterdam. Temperatures of –6 on 9 March 1988 caused Wankdorf to be rather sparsely occupied with only 7,686 spectators. Ajax won the game 1–0. The return leg in Amsterdam before 30,000 spectators saw the Bernese lose again 1–0 to fall out of the competition.|$|E

[...] The complexity of characters such as Daenerys, Arya and the Kingslayer will keep readers turning even the vast number of pages contained in this volume, for the author, like Tolkien or Jordan, makes us care about their fates. Those two fantasy greats are also evoked by Martin's ability to convey such sensual experiences as the heat of wildfire, the <b>chill</b> <b>of</b> ice, {{the smell of the}} sea and the sheer gargantuan indigestibility of the medieval banquet at its most excessive. Perhaps this saga doesn't go as far beyond the previous bounds of high fantasy as some claim, but for most readers it certainly goes far enough to command their attention." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to study <b>chilling</b> <b>of</b> beef {{carcasses}} in on-farm slaughterhouses in Sweden. Two approaches to evaluate the chilling process were used. Firstly, continuous measurements of surface temperatures on individual carcasses and, secondly, a recent Australian method in which temperature readings were combined with a predictive microbiology growth model. In the Australian method the potential growth of Escherichia coli during chilling is calculated based on the growth rate estimated by the growth model at the measured temperatures. The potential growth during the chilling process is the expressed as a refrigeration index, RI, which is the log 10 of the potential increase of the number of E. coli bacteria during chilling. In addition, a simple tool, i. e. an Excel spreadsheet, was developed and evaluated. The tool enables an estimation of the cooling capacity needed for chilling beef, lamb, or swine. The primary purpose of the tool is to indicate the required cooling capacity in planned slaughterhouses based on drawings and slaughter volumes. The present study only considered aspects <b>of</b> <b>chilling</b> related to food safety. Eleven slaughterhouses participated in the survey, and <b>chilling</b> <b>of</b> a total of 169 carcasses, ranging from 4 to 10 per occasion, were measured. The total number of carcasses in the chilling room ranged from 4 to 26 per occasion.
