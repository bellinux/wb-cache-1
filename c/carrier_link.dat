40|$|Optical {{interconnect}} is {{a potential}} solution to attain the large bandwidth on-chip communications needed in high performance computers in a low power and low cost manner. Mode-division multiplexing (MDM) is an emerging technology that scales the capacity of a single wavelength carrier {{by the number of}} modes in a multimode waveguide, and is attractive as a cost-effective means for high bandwidth density on-chip communications. Advanced modulation formats with high spectral efficiency in MDM networks can further improve the data rates of the optical link. Here, we demonstrate an intra-chip MDM communications link employing advanced modulation formats with two waveguide modes. We demonstrate a compact single wavelength <b>carrier</b> <b>link</b> that is expected to support 2 x 100 Gb/s mode multiplexed capacity. The network comprised integrated microring modulators at the transmitter, mode multiplexers, multimode waveguide interconnect, mode demultiplexers and integrated germanium on silicon photodetectors. Each of the mode channels achieves 100 Gb/s line rate with 84 Gb/s net payload data rate at 7 % overhead for hard-decision forward error correction (HD-FEC) in the OFDM/ 16 -QAM signal transmission...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Enterprise {{networks}} are increasingly offloading {{the responsibility for}} worm detection and containment to the carrier networks. However, current approaches to the zero-day worm detection problem such as those based on content similarity of packet payloads are not scalable to the <b>carrier</b> <b>link</b> speeds (OC- 48 and up-wards). In this paper, we introduce a new system, namely DoWitcher, {{which in contrast to}} previous approaches is scalable as well as able to detect the stealthiest worms that employ low-propagation rates or polymorphisms to evade detection. DoWitcher uses an incremental approach toward worm detection: First, it examines the layer- 4 traffic features to discern the presence of a worm anomaly; Next, it determines a flowfilter mask that can be applied to isolate the suspect worm flows and; Finally, it enables full-packet capture of only those flows that match the mask, which are then processed by a Longest Common Subsequence algorithm to extract the worm content signature. Via a proof-of-concept implementation on a commercially available network analyzer processing raw packets from an OC- 48 link, we demonstrate the capability of DoWitcher to detect low-rate worms and extract signatures for even the polymorphic worms.

40|$|ABSTRACT. 5 -Aminosalicylic acid is an {{anti-inflammatory}} drug used in {{the treatment}} of inflammatory bowel diseases including ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease.

With this aim, textured MgO tunnel barriers are fabricated either by sputtering or molecular-beam-epitaxy (MBE) methods. For the given growth parameters used for the two techniques, we observe that the circular polarization of the electroluminescence emitted by spin LEDs is rather stable {{as a function of the}} injected current or applied bias for the samples with sputtered tunnel barriers, whereas the corresponding circular polarization decreases abruptly for tunnel barriers grown by MBE.

40|$|AbstractThe role of {{plastoquinone}} as {{a mobile}} redox <b>carrier</b> <b>linking</b> photosystem II and the cytochrome b 6 −f complex is considered. It is proposed that plastoquinone is located primarily within the fluid bilayer-midplane {{region of the}} thylakoid membrane and thus can move laterally at very fast rates corresponding to a microscopic diffusion coefficient of 10 − 6 cm 2 ·s− 1. Because {{of the presence of}} integral proteins the diffusion path will be tortuous and extended, giving rise to a sub-macroscopic diffusion coefficient which is lower than the above value. Even so it is concluded that within the half-time for electron donation to the cytochrome b 6 −f complex there is adequate time for plastoquinone to diffuse over a distance equivalent to the radius of a granum membrane...|$|R
