40|$|Apple {{consumers}} continuously demand {{better quality}} apples and texture (i. e. hardness, cohesiveness, fracturability,) {{is a critical}} aspect of apple quality. Apples texture was studied by various methods (penetrometry, compression, sonic transmission, sensory) and impact of factors (storage temperature, light, <b>conditioning</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> maturity…) but little information is available about the soil impact on the apple quality. So, {{the main purpose of}} this study was to investigate the soil impact on the apple texture, which is characterised by penetrometry and compression. Penetrometry and compression tests were performed on a French apple cultivars, Golden Smoothee ® coming from two different soils S 1 (loam, sandy and clay) and S 2 (clay and no-limestone). The preliminary study shows that soil have an impact on apple texture (rupture breakdown force, maximal force, slope of the force deformation curve and gumminess). Results have also shown that the effect of soil is more important than the effect of cultivars on textural parameters like chewiness and gumminess. ...|$|E

40|$|Two {{measures}} {{were presented to}} improve the laser-induced damage resistance of the optical films used in vacuum environments. Firstly, {{the impact of a}} few O- 2, N- 2 and He- 2 introduced in vacuum on the laser-induced damage threshold of the dielectric mirror coatings were investigated. Then, laser <b>conditioning</b> effects in <b>atmosphere</b> environments on the laser-induced damage threshold of the dielectric mirror coatings used in vacuum environments were also investigated. It was found that a few O- 2, N- 2 introduced in vacuum can effectively improve the laser damage resistance of the optical films in vacuum environment due to the resistance to air-vacuum effect. However, a few He- 2 have no this effect on laser induced damage threshold (LIDT) of the films. In addition, laser <b>conditioning</b> in <b>atmosphere</b> can also effectively improve the LIDT of the optical thin films used in vacuum environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

40|$|AbstractThe lower Algerian Sahara is {{experiencing}} an unprecedented urban growth, causing a socio-spatial upheaval and an ecological imbalance of oasis ecosystems that are {{embodied in the}} detachment of the palm trees from the urban areas. [1] This detachment actively participates in the increase of the Urban Heat Island, {{as well as the}} over-urbanization on the account of farmlands. Hence the abundance of palm groves, participates in the activation of desertification.

2500|$|A Christmas break followed, and filming resumed on January 17. Ian McKellen, {{fresh from}} filming X-Men, arrived to film scenes in Hobbiton and the Grey Havens. McKellen {{did not become}} that close to the lead Hobbit actors, as he {{generally}} worked with their scale doubles, but when Christopher Lee arrived in February, they became very friendly. Shooting the fight sequence in the Orthanc interiors, without air <b>conditioning</b> (for <b>atmosphere)</b> but with heavy wigs and robes, was described by the actors as [...] "murder". The Grey Havens sequence, which {{takes place at the}} end of The Return of the King, was shot three times due to Sean Astin forgetting his vest after lunch and, then, an out-of-focus camera.|$|R
40|$|In {{this more}} {{advancing}} era, society {{has become more}} {{aware of the importance of}} knowledge. This is evident in the increasing number of people registered at institutions providing education. One of the educational institutions is "X" University in Surabaya which participates in fulfilling the society 2 ̆ 7 s needs of knowledge. This research was conducted to find out and elaborate the evaluation results on post-occupied classrooms towards the room formation elements (floors, ceilings, walls), the room <b>conditioning</b> elements (lighting, <b>atmosphere,</b> acoustic systems, circulations, and interior designs), and the room filling elements (furniture) as well as the comfort of the classroom occupants of the Interior Design major in "X" University in Surabaya. The methods used for this research is Post Occupancy Evaluation (POE) and qualitative-quantitative methodology to obtain any available information from the 11 classes that have been observed individually to come to solid evidence. The research results show that every class has more or less similar problems related to the room formation elements (floors, ceilings, walls), the room <b>conditioning</b> elements (lighting, <b>atmosphere,</b> acoustic systems, circulations, and interior designs), and the room filling elements (furniture), so some alternative solutions have been formulated regarding the material choices for the classrooms...|$|R
50|$|Whether {{trained as}} police {{originally}} or not, Gestapo agents themselves were shaped by their socio-political environment. Historian George C. Browder contends {{that there was}} a four-part process (authorization, bolstering, routinization, and dehumanization) in effect which legitimized the psycho-social <b>atmosphere</b> <b>conditioning</b> members of the Gestapo to radicalized violence. Browder also describes a sandwich effect, where from above; Gestapo agents were subjected to ideologically oriented racism and criminal biological theories; and from below, the Gestapo was transformed by SS personnel who did not have the proper police training, which showed in their propensity for unrestrained violence. This admixture certainly shaped the Gestapo's public image which they sought to maintain in lieu of their increasing workload; an image which helped them identify and eliminate enemies of the Nazi state.|$|R
5|$|Geheime Staatspolizei ("Secret State Police"; Gestapo) was {{the secret}} police force of Nazi Germany and German-occupied Europe. Formed in April 1933 by the {{aviation}} minister Hermann Göring, it was by the following year administrated by the SS and regarded as a sister organization of the SD. The Gestapo relied on members of other agencies, spies and a huge network of informants for information. It was led by Heydrich and Heinrich Müller. Whether trained as police originally or not, Gestapo agents themselves were shaped by their socio-political environment. Historian George C.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the vertical thermodynamic profile associated with two cases of deep orographic convection were studied with data from an instrumented aircraft, mobile surface based radiosondes, and stereo photogrammetric analyses. The data were collected during a field experiment [i. e., the Cumulus Photogrammetric, In Situ, and Doppler Observations (CuPIDO) experiment in 2006] performed over the Santa Catalina Mountains in southern Arizona. In both cases the vertical thermodynamic profile was modified {{in a way that}} supported subsequent deep convection. In one case, a midtropospheric stable layer was eroded through low-level warming and cooling at the cloud-top level that was likely due to an adiabatic adjustment of the profile through the action of gravity waves. In the second case, dry air aloft was moistened through the action of the shallow convection thus preventing the erosion of the convective turrets through entrainment of dry air. These cases illustrate mechanisms for convective <b>conditioning</b> of the <b>atmosphere</b> that may organiz...|$|R
40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: Grand {{challenges}} in global change research and environmental science raise {{the need for}} replicated experiments on ecosystems subjected to controlled changes in multiple environmental factors. We designed and developed the Ecolab as a variable climate and atmosphere simulator for multifactor experimentation on natural or artificial ecosystems. The Ecolab integrates <b>atmosphere</b> <b>conditioning</b> technology optimized for accuracy and reliability. The centerpiece is a highly contained, 13 -m 3 chamber to host communities of aquatic and terrestrial species and control climate (temperature, humidity, rainfall, irradiance) and atmosphere conditions (O 2 and CO 2 concentrations). Temperature in the atmosphere and in the water or soil column can be controlled independently of each other. All climatic and atmospheric variables can be programmed to follow dynamical trajectories and simulate gradual as well as step changes. We demonstrate the Ecolab’s capacity to simulate {{a broad range of}} atmospheric and climatic conditions, their diurnal and seasonal variations, and to support the growth of a model terrestrial plant in two contrasting climate scenarios. The adaptabilit...|$|R
40|$|Plant growth, and {{especially}} plant performance experiments in microgravity {{are limited by}} the currently available plant growth facilities (low light levels, inadequate nutrient delivery and <b>atmosphere</b> <b>conditioning</b> systems, insufficient science instrumentation, infrequent flight opportunities). In addition, mission durations of 10 to 14 days aboard the NSTS Space Shuttle allow for only brief periods of microgravity exposure {{with respect to the}} life cycle of a plant. Based on seed germination experiments, using the Generic BioProcessing Apparatus hardware (GBA), two new payloads have been designed specifically for plant growth. These payloads provide new opportunities for plant gravitational and space biology research and emphasize the investigation of plant performance (photosynthesis, biomass accumulations) in microgravity. The Plant-Module for Autonomous Space Support (P-MASS) was designed to utilize microgravity exposure times in excess of 30 days on the first flight of the recoverable COMET satellite (Commercial Experiment Transporter). The Plant-Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus (P-GBA), is designed for the National Space Transportation System (NSTS) Space Shuttle middeck and the SPACEHAB environment. The P-GBA is an evolution from the GBA hardware and P-MASS (plant chamber and instrumentation). The available light levels of both payloads more than double currently available capabilities...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} was to study the effect of two controlled atmosphere (CA) compositions – 3 % O 2 and 6 % CO 2, and 3 %O 2 and 10 % CO 2 – on total counts of microorganisms at 30 °C and 7 °C, count of yeasts and moulds, count of enterobacteriaceae, and count of lactic acid bacteria of carrageenan coated fresh-cut ‘Cavendish’ banana. Bananas were previously submitted (or not) to a chemical dip of 1 % calcium chloride, 0. 5 % ascorbic acid and 0. 75 % L-cystein. After a nine-day storage at 6 °C, samples that had been chemically treated and submitted to CA with 10 % CO 2 presented total aerobic plated count (at 30 °C and 7 °C), and yeasts and moulds count lower than other samples. The chemical dip improved the antimicrobial capacity of the coating associated to the controlled <b>atmosphere</b> <b>conditioning,</b> especially with 10 % CO 2. Fresh-cut banana coated with carrageenan and previously chemically treated (or not) was safe during the nine-day storage at 6 °C, with microbial counts below the limits referred in the literature. It is important for food industry to know the best conditions for storage {{in order to produce}} safe products...|$|R
40|$|Background There is an {{increasing}} need for allergen inhalation systems to perform basic clinical research and test anti-allergic drugs under well-controlled conditions. This requires stability of environmental conditions like temperature and humidity, as well as allergen concentration and reproducible induction of allergic symptoms. Objective The {{aim of this study}} was to validate an environmental exposure unit for controlled human pollen inhalation studies in participants with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Methods Temperature, relative humidity, and air flow rate were kept constant with an air <b>conditioning</b> system. Pollen <b>atmosphere</b> was generated using a specially designed feeding system and monitored online by laser counter and offline using rotating rod samplers. Efficacy (total nasal symptom score, nasal air flow rate, nasal secretion) and safety (lung function) parameters were evaluated at different pollen concentrations and repeated allergen challenges. Results Temperature, humidity, and air flow rate in the environmental exposure unit remained constant within a range of < 2 %. The spatial distribution and the temporal stability of the pollen concentration varied only slightly over 4 h (+/- 10 % and < 4 %, respectively). Dose-dependent induction of allergic rhinitis symptoms, reduction in nasal air flow rate, and increase in nasal secretion were observed over time. These effects were reproducible from day to day. Lung function remained clinically normal at all concentrations and from day to day. Conclusions Thus, pollen exposure in the environmental exposure unit is an effective, reproducible, safe, and suitable method for single-centre clinical studies on the efficacy of anti-allergic treatment or basic clinical research...|$|R
40|$|Ao grande crescimento das fronteiras mercadológicas e ao extraordinário progresso científico verificado na avicultura industrial, contrapõe-se a pouca atenção que se deu, até recentemente, às técnicas de alojamento e, efetivamente, ao ambiente de criação das aves. Somente há questão de sete anos, com a perspectiva do processo de globalização que hoje movimenta a economia mundial, essa indústria passou a buscar, nas instalações e no ambiente, as possibilidades de melhoria no desempenho avícola e a redução dos custos de produção como forma de manter a competitividade. A produção de aves em alta densidade passou a ser imperativa e, dessa forma, a exigência de conforto térmico ambiental, que já havia crescido muito com o aumento da precocidade das aves, tornou-se ainda maior, como conseqüência da elevação da densidade de alojamento. Assim, para se manter competitiva, a indústria avícola brasileira está tendo de evoluir, rapidamente, de uma situação de quase indiferença aos princípios do acondicionamento térmico ambiente, para uma situação em que cada empresa ou integração deve tomar decisões relativas à adoção de concepções arquitetônicas e manejos inovadores, associados a sistemas de acondicionamento térmico naturais e artificiais, compatíveis com a sua realidade. Essas decisões incluem a readequação dos galpões já existentes e a concepção de novas unidades. Seguramente, estamos vivendo o momento de mais intensas transformações dos alojamentos avícolas brasileiros até então presenciado. Do exposto, esse trabalho busca abordar o planejamento, a concepção arquitetônica e os diferentes materiais e técnicas construtivas disponíveis para a indústria avícola brasileira no que diz respeito aos galpões de alojamentos das aves, visando propiciar um melhor acondicionamento térmico ambiente, compatível com as diferentes regiões climáticas brasileiras. To {{the great}} {{growth of the}} market and the {{extraordinary}} scientific progress verified in the Brazilian poultry industry, little attention was given, until recently, to the lodging techniques and, indeed, to the environment of growing birds. This is only a seven year-old subject, and with the perspective of the globalization process that today moves the world economy, this industry started to look for facilities and environment, seeking the improvement possibilities in the poultry activity and the reduction of the production costs as a form of maintaining the competitiveness. The high-density production of birds became imperative and, this way, the demand of environmental thermal comfort, which had already grown a lot with the increase of the precocity of the birds, became even larger, {{as a consequence of the}} increase of lodging density. Thus, to continue being competitive, the Brazilian poultry industry has to develop, as soon as possible, from the situation of almost indifference of the beginning of the thermal <b>atmosphere</b> <b>conditioning,</b> to a situation in which each company or integration should take its own decisions of adoption of architectural conceptions and innovations associated with systems of thermal, natural and artificial conditioning, compatible with its reality. Decisions that already include the modifications of the existing houses and the conception of new units. We are witnessing, for sure, the moment of more intense transformations of the Brazilian poultry lodgings. From what was exposed, this work intends to approach the planning, the architectural conception and the different materials and available constructive techniques for the Brazilian poultry industry that refers to the lodgings of the birds, seeking to propitiate a better conditioned thermal atmosphere, compatible with the different Brazilian climatic areas...|$|R
