5|$|Following a {{demonstration}} at Remington's offices in New York, the company contracted on March1, 1873, to manufacture 1,000machines, with {{the option to}} produce an additional 24,000. Although the agreement required Densmore to give Remington $10,000 and royalty rights, a marketing firm to be formed by Densmore and Yost was allowed {{to serve as the}} exclusive sales agent. Remington dedicated a wing of its factory to the typewriter, and spent several months retooling and re-engineering the device; production began in September and the machine entered the market on July1, 1874. Typewriter production was largely overseen by Jefferson Clough and William K. Jenne, manager of Remington's sewing machine division. The redesigned machine was sturdier and more reliable than Sholes' model, but it had taken on some of the characteristics of a sewing machine, including a japanned case with floral ornamentation and a stand with a treadle to operate the <b>carriage</b> <b>return.</b> The typewriter, however, had been rushed into production with insufficient testing, and early models were soon returned for adjustments and repair.|$|E
25|$|MS-DOS and Windows use {{a common}} text file format, with each line of text {{separated}} by a two-character combination: <b>carriage</b> <b>return</b> (CR) and line feed (LF). It is common for {{the last line of}} text not to be terminated with a CR-LF marker, and many text editors (including Notepad) do not automatically insert one on the last line.|$|E
25|$|Limited {{whitespace}} {{is allowed}} and ignored around or between syntactic elements (values and punctuation, but not within a string value). Only four specific characters are considered whitespace for this purpose: space, horizontal tab, line feed, and <b>carriage</b> <b>return.</b> In particular, the byte order mark {{must not be}} generated by a conforming implementation (though it may be accepted when parsing JSON). JSON does not provide syntax for comments.|$|E

25|$|XML 1.1 {{extends the}} set of allowed {{characters}} to include all the above, plus the remaining characters in the range U+0001–U+001F. At the same time, however, it restricts the use of C0 and C1 control characters other than U+0009 (Horizontal Tab), U+000A (Line Feed), U+000D (<b>Carriage</b> <b>Return),</b> and U+0085 (Next Line) by requiring them to be written in escaped form (for example U+0001 must be written as &#x01; or its equivalent). In the case of C1 characters, this restriction is a backwards incompatibility; it was introduced to allow common encoding errors to be detected.|$|E
25|$|Netascii is a {{modified}} form of ASCII, defined in RFC 764. It {{consists of an}} 8-bit extension of the 7-bit ASCII character space from 0x20 to 0x7F (the printable characters and the space) and eight of the control characters. The allowed control characters include the null (0x00), the line feed (LF, 0x0A), and the <b>carriage</b> <b>return</b> (CR, 0x0D). Netascii also requires {{that the end of}} line marker on a host be translated to the character pair CR LF for transmission, and that any CR must be followed by either a LF or the null.|$|E
25|$|The 5 {{data bits}} allow for only 32 {{different}} codes, which cannot accommodate the 26 letters, 10 figures, space, a few punctuation marks and the required control codes, such as <b>carriage</b> <b>return,</b> new line, bell, etc. To overcome this limitation, the teleprinter has two states, the unshifted or letters {{state and the}} shifted or numbers or figures state. The change from one state to the other takes place when the special control codes LETTERS and FIGURES are sent from the keyboard or received from the line. In the letters state the teleprinter prints the letters and space while in the shifted state it prints the numerals and punctuation marks. Teleprinters for languages using other alphabets also use an additional third shift state, in which they print letters in the alternative alphabet.|$|E

2500|$|The Perkins Brailler is a [...] "braille typewriter" [...] {{with a key}} {{corresponding}} {{to each of the}} six dots of the braille code, a space key, a backspace key, and a line space key. [...] Like a manual typewriter, it has two side knobs to advance paper through the machine and a <b>carriage</b> <b>return</b> lever above the keys. [...] The rollers that hold and advance the paper have grooves designed to avoid crushing the raised dots the brailler creates.|$|E
2500|$|In most of {{the early}} typewriters, the typebars struck upward against the paper, pressed against {{the bottom of the}} platen, so the typist could not see the text as it was typed. [...] What was typed was not visible until a <b>carriage</b> <b>return</b> caused it to scroll into view. [...] The {{difficulty}} with any other arrangement was ensuring the typebars fell back into place reliably when the key was released. This was eventually achieved with various ingenious mechanical designs and so-called [...] "visible typewriters" [...] which used frontstriking, in which the typebars struck forward against the front side of the platen, became standard.|$|E

50|$|Terminals may {{be given}} time to {{exercise}} various control codes that would (on a teletypewriter or similar) result in physical movements of the carriage that may take significant (from the computer's point of view) amounts of time, such as backspaces, horizontal tabs, <b>carriage</b> <b>returns,</b> form feeds, and line feeds.|$|R

50|$|The {{differences}} between character representation can cause problems during modem communication between Ataris and other computers. Cursor movement commands (and even <b>carriage</b> <b>returns</b> and line feeds) from computers not using ATASCII will be nonsense on an Atari, and vice versa.

50|$|The {{machine was}} {{programmed}} primarily {{with a plastic}} tape that moved synchronously with the typewriter carriage. Each tape would typically handle one application. The tape mechanism was mounted behind the carriage in the typewriter unit. Further programming was provided in the card machines program drums.
