25|$|Most of {{the mujahideen}} decided {{to remain in}} <b>Chechnya</b> after the {{withdrawal}} of Russian forces. In 1999, foreign fighters {{played an important role}} in the ill-fated Chechen incursion into Dagestan, where they suffered a decisive defeat and were forced to retreat back into <b>Chechnya.</b> The incursion provided the new Russian government with a pretext for intervention. Russian ground forces invaded <b>Chechnya</b> again in December 1999.|$|E
25|$|Counter-insurgency {{operations}} {{have been conducted}} by Russian army in <b>Chechnya</b> since 1999. President of <b>Chechnya,</b> and former separatist, Ramzan Kadyrov declared this phase to end in March 2009. On 27 March 2009, President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev met with Alexander Bortnikov, the Director of the Federal Security Service to discuss the official ending of counter-terrorism operations in <b>Chechnya.</b> Medvedev directed the National Anti-Terrorism Committee, which Bortnikov also heads, {{to report to the}} Russian government on this issue, which will then be decided by the Russian parliament. However Medvedev asserted that situation in <b>Chechnya</b> must remain under direct control of the FSB. Close to 480 active insurgents are currently fighting in the mountains under leadership of field commander Doku Umarov according to official data.|$|E
25|$|However, {{internal}} tribal conflicts weakened Shamil and he {{was captured}} in 1859. The war formally ended in 1862 when Russia promised autonomy for <b>Chechnya</b> and other Caucasian ethnic groups. However, <b>Chechnya</b> and the surrounding region, including northern Dagestan, were incorporated into Russia as the Terek Oblast.|$|E

25|$|In 1991, <b>Chechnya</b> {{declared}} {{independence and}} was named the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. According to some sources, from 1991 to 1994, {{tens of thousands of}} people of non-Chechen ethnicity (mostly Russians, Ukrainians and Armenians) left the republic amidst reports of violence and discrimination against the non-Chechen population. Other sources do not identify displacement as a significant factor in the events of the period, instead focussing on the deteriorating domestic situation within <b>Chechnya,</b> the aggressive politics of the Chechyen President, Dzhokhar Dudayev, and the domestic political ambitions of Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Russian army forces invaded Grozny in 1994 but, after two years of intense fighting, the Russian troops eventually withdrew from <b>Chechnya</b> under the Khasavyurt Accord. <b>Chechnya</b> preserved its de facto independence until the second war broke out in 1999.|$|E

25|$|After staging another coup d'état {{attempt in}} December 1993, the {{opposition}} organized {{themselves into the}} Provisional Council of the Chechen Republic as a potential alternative government for <b>Chechnya,</b> calling on Moscow for assistance. In August 1994, the coalition of the opposition factions based in north <b>Chechnya</b> launched a large-scale armed campaign to remove Dudayev's government.|$|E
25|$|Although {{large-scale}} fighting within <b>Chechnya</b> had ceased, daily attacks continued {{particularly in}} the southern portions of <b>Chechnya,</b> spilling into nearby territories of the Caucasus as well, especially since the Caucasus Front was established. Typically small separatist units target Russian and pro-Russian officials, security forces, and military and police convoys and vehicles. The separatist units employ IEDs and sometimes group up for larger raids. Russian forces then retaliate with artillery and air strikes, as well as counter-insurgency operations. Most soldiers in <b>Chechnya</b> are now kontraktniki (contract soldiers) {{as opposed to the}} earlier conscripts. While Russia continues to maintain military presence within <b>Chechnya,</b> Russia's federal forces play less of a direct role in <b>Chechnya.</b> Pro-Kremlin Chechen forces under the command of the local strongman Ramzan Kadyrov, known as the kadyrovtsy now dominate law enforcement and security operations, with many members (including Kadyrov himself) being former Chechen separatists who have defected since 1999. Since 2004, the Kadyrovtsy were partly incorporated into two Interior Ministry units North and South (Sever and Yug). Two other units of the Chechen pro-Moscow forces, East and West (Vostok and Zapad), are commanded by Sulim Yamadayev (Vostok) and Said-Magomed Kakiyev (Zapad) and their men.|$|E
