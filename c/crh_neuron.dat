40|$|Objective: Previous {{studies on}} the effects of altered thyroid {{function}} on the secretion and metabolism of adrenocortical hormones suggest a degree of adrenocortical hyperactivity in hyperthyroidism. We have previously shown that experimentally-induced hyperthyroidism is associated with significant alterations in pituitary–adrenal responsiveness to synthetic ovine corticotropin-releasing hormone (oCRH) that are contingent upon the duration of the altered thyroid function. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the time-dependent effects of hyperthyroidism on the functional integrity of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis by in vivo stimulation of the hypothalamic <b>CRH</b> <b>neuron</b> and adrenal cortex. Methods: The functional integrity of the HPA axis was examined in vivo in sham-thyroidectomized male Sprague-Dawley rats given placebo or in thyroidectomized rats given 50 mg of thyroxine every day for 7 or 60 days. Responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia and IL- 1 a stimulation were used to assess the hypothalamic <b>CRH</b> <b>neuron.</b> Adrenocortical reserve was assessed in response to low-dose adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), following suppression of the HPA axis with dexa-methasone.

40|$|To {{examine whether}} the {{hypothalamic}} corticotropin-releasing hormone (<b>CRH)</b> <b>neuron</b> is regulated by CRH, by {{products of the}} proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene, and/or by glucocorticoids, we used a rat hypothalamic organ culture system in which rat CRH secretion from single explanted hypothalami was evaluated by an RIA (iCRH) specific for rat CRH. The effects of graded concentrations of ovine CRH (oCRH), adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH), beta-endorphin (beta-EP), alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), corticotropin-like intermediate lobe peptide (CLIP), ovine beta-lipotropin (ovine beta-LPH), and dexamethasone (DEX) upon unstimulated and serotonin- (5 HT), acetylcholine- (ACh), and norepinephrine-(NE) stimulated CRH secretion were determined. oCRH and DEX inhibited unstimulated iCRH secretion with ID 50 at the 10 (- 8) M range. ACTH had no detectable suppressive effect at 10 (- 8) M. oCRH, ACTH, and DEX inhibited 5 HT-, ACh-, and NE-stimulated iCRH secretion in a dose-dependent fashion. beta-EP, alpha-MSH, and CLIP also inhibited 5 HT-induced iCRH secretion. Of the latter peptides, the strongest inhibitor was beta-EP and the weakest was CLIP. Ovine beta-LPH had only a weak inhibitory effect on 5 HT-induced iCRH secretion. Generally, the concentrations required for 50 % suppression of neurotransmitter-stimulated iCRH secretion were significantly lower than those required for a similar suppression of unstimulated iCRH secretion. In conclusion, these data suggest the presence of multiple negative feedback loops involved in the regulation of the hypothalamic CRH neuron: an ultrashort CRH-mediated loop, a short, hypothalamic POMC-derived peptide loop, and a long, glucocorticoid-mediated negative feedback loop. The potency of these negative feedback loops may {{be determined by the}} state of activation of the <b>CRH</b> <b>neuron...</b>|$|E
40|$|The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a neuroendocrine {{system that}} regulates {{numerous}} physiological processes. Disruptions {{in the activity}} of the HPA axis are correlated with many stress-related diseases such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder. In this paper, we characterize "normal" and "diseased" states of the HPA axis as basins of attraction of a dynamical system describing the inhibition of peptide hormones such as corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by circulating glucocorticoids such as cortisol (CORT). In addition to including key physiological features such as ultradian oscillations in cortisol levels and self-upregulation of <b>CRH</b> <b>neuron</b> activity, our model distinguishes the relatively slow process of cortisol-mediated CRH biosynthesis from rapid trans-synaptic effects that regulate the CRH secretion process. Crucially, we find that the slow regulation mechanism mediates external stress-driven transitions between the stable states in novel, intensity, duration, and timing-dependent ways. These results indicate that the timing of traumatic events may be an important factor in determining if and how patients will exhibit hallmarks of stress disorders. Our model also suggests a mechanism whereby exposure therapy of stress disorders such as PTSD may act to normalize downstream dysregulation of the HPA axis.

Clinical data and nuclear androgen receptor (AR) immunoreactivity (ir) in the hypothalamic medial mamillary nucleus (MMN) were used as an estimate for changes in circulating sex hormone levels. It was confirmed that nuclear AR-ir staining in the MMN is a good estimate for abnormal peripheral androgen levels and that the <b>CRH</b> <b>neurons</b> in the hypothalamic PVN are activated with age in male subjects. Male subjects with lower testosterone levels due to castration showed significantly fewer <b>CRH</b> <b>neurons</b> than age-matched male controls.

Since estrogens can prevent the drop of CRH cell number following castration in MF transsexuals, and more <b>CRH</b> <b>neurons</b> were found {{in the case of an}} estrogen-producing tumor, estrogen seems to play a stimulating role in the activity of <b>CRH</b> <b>neurons</b> in the PVN.

To determine whether this age-related change depends on gender and whether circulating sex hormones play a role, we analyzed the total number of CRH-immunoreactive neurons by means of immunocytochemistry and image analysis in the postmortem hypothalamic PVN of 22 control subjects (11 males and 11 females) between the ages of 22 and 89 years, and of 10 subjects with abnormal sex hormone status. Our data show that men have a significantly larger number of <b>CRH</b> <b>neurons</b> than women (p = 0. 004) and that the total number of <b>CRH</b> <b>neurons</b> increases significantly with age, but only in male controls (p = 0. 032), not in female controls (p = 0. 733). Female controls do not show a significant change in the total number of <b>CRH</b> <b>neurons</b> either before or after the age (50 years) of menopause (p = 0. 792).

40|$|Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), {{which is}} {{synthesized}} in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, {{plays an important}} role in the endocrine stress response. The excitability of CRH neurons is regulated by γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) –containing neurons projecting to the PVN. We investigated the role of GABA in the regulation of CRH release. The release of CRH was impaired, accumulating in the cell bodies of CRH neurons in heterozygous GAD 67 -GFP (green fluorescent protein) knock-in mice (GAD 67 +/GFP), which exhibited decreased GABA content. The GABAA receptor (GABAAR) and the Na+-K+- 2 Cl− cotransporter (NKCC 1), but not the K+-Cl− cotransporter (KCC 2), were expressed in the terminals of the CRH neurons at the median eminence (ME). In contrast, CRH neuronal somata were enriched with KCC 2 but not with NKCC 1. Thus, intracellular Cl− concentrations ([Cl−]i) may be increased at the terminals of CRH neurons compared with concentrations in the cell body. Moreover, GABAergic terminals projecting from the arcuate nucleus were present in close proximity to CRH-positive nerve terminals. Furthermore, a GABAAR agonist increased the intracellular calcium (Ca 2 +) levels in the <b>CRH</b> <b>neuron</b> terminals but decreased the Ca 2 + levels in their somata. In addition, the increases in Ca 2 + concentrations were prevented by an NKCC 1 inhibitor. We propose a novel mechanism by which the excitatory action of GABA maintains a steady-state CRH release from axon terminals in the ME. 浜松医科大学学位論文　医博第 739 号（平成 28 年 11 月 18 日...|$|E
40|$|We have {{recently}} found that susceptibility to streptococcal cell wall (SCW) -induced arthritis in Lewis (LEW/N) rats is due, in part, to defective inflammatory and stress mediator-induced {{activation of the}} hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Conversely, the relative arthritis resistance of histocompatible Fischer (F 344 /N) rats is related to their intact responses to the same stimuli. Specifically, LEW/N rats, in contrast to F 344 /N rats, have markedly impaired plasma corticotropin and corticosterone responses to SCW, recombinant human interleukin 1 alpha, the serotonin agonist quipazine, or synthetic rat/human corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). To explore the mechanism of this defect, we examined the functional integrity of the hypothalamic <b>CRH</b> <b>neuron</b> in LEW/N rats compared to F 344 /N rats. LEW/N rats, in contrast to F 344 /N rats, showed profoundly deficient paraventricular nucleus CRH mRNA levels and hypothalamic CRH content in response to SCW. Compared to F 344 /N rats, there was no increase in LEW/N hypothalamic CRH content or CRH release from explanted LEW/N hypothalami in organ culture in response to recombinant interleukin 1 alpha. These data provide strong evidence that the defective LEW/N corticotropin and corticosterone responses to inflammatory and other stress mediators, and the LEW/N susceptibility to experimental arthritis, are {{due in part to}} a hypothalamic defect in the synthesis and secretion of CRH. The additional finding of deficient expression in LEW/N rats of the hypothalamic enkephalin gene, which is coordinately regulated with the CRH gene in response to stress, suggests that the primary defect is not in the CRH gene but is instead related to its inappropriate regulation...|$|E
40|$|Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) is a 38 -amino-acid polypeptide, first {{isolated}} from hypothalamus, which directly stimulates in vitro {{the production of}} cAMP {{as well as the}} release of several pituitary hormones, such as growth hormone and luteinizing hormone. In vivo, PACAP has been shown to stimulate ACTH release. The presence of PACAP receptors in several brain areas, including the hypothalamus, suggests that this peptide might play a role as a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator and might be involved in the regulation of hypophysiotropic neurohormones. In order to study the role of PACAP on corticotropin-releasing hormone (<b>CRH)</b> <b>neuron,</b> we have investigated the effects of intracerebroventricular (i. c. v.) and intravenous (i. v.) injections of PACAP and the potent PACAP antagonist PACAP(6 - 38) on CRH gene expression in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) in the male rat. The levels of CRH mRNA were evaluated by quantitative in situ hybridization. The i. c. v. injection of PACAP (4 microg/kg b. wt.) produced a 22 % increase in the hybridization signal, an effect which was completely prevented by the concomitant injection of the PACAP antagonist (4 microg/kg b. wt.). On the other hand, the administration of the PACAP antagonist induced by itself a 40 % decrease in the amounts of CRH mRNA. The i. v. injection of the same peptides (100 microg/kg. b. wt.) produced very similar results. These data strongly suggest that PACAP is involved in the positive regulation of CRH gene expression via specific central receptors and then can play a role as a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator. The effect observed after i. v. injection of PACAP also suggests that the circulating levels of PACAP can {{play a role in the}} modulation of CRH gene expression. PACAP might then be involved in the regulation of the HPA axis by a double mechanism: stimulation of CRH gene expression at the central level and direct effect on pituitary corticotrophs...|$|E

Next, we precisely located and counted the EYFP-labeled neurons in different regions according to propidium iodide counterstained anatomical reference using Neuronal Global Position System.

We use the developed dynamical systems model of the HPA axis to understand the mechanisms underlying clinical protocols used to probe patient stress response.

We show that some previously observed features and experimental observations can arise from the dynamics intrinsic to our bistable model, rather than relying on specific and permanent parameter changes due to physiological disruption.

Western blot of hypothalamic proteins from rats receiving intracerebroventricular PRL injection revealed increases in phosphorylation of the MAPK and ERK. Double-staining immunohistochemistry demonstrated phosphorylated ERK localization in parvocellular <b>CRH</b> <b>neurons</b> as well as magnocellular vasopressin and oxytocin neurons of the hypothalamic paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic nuclei. PRL also induced ERK phosphorylation in vitro in the hypothalamic cell line, 4 B, which expresses PRL receptors, and in primary hypothalamic neuronal cultures. Using reporter gene assays in 4 B cells, or quantitative RT-PCR for primary transcript in hypothalamic cell cultures, PRL potentiated forskolin-stimulated CRH transcription through activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway. The effect of PRL in hypothalamic cell cultures was unaffected by tetrodotoxin, suggesting a direct effect on <b>CRH</b> <b>neurons.</b> The data show that PRL activates the ERK/MAPK pathway and facilitates CRH transcription in <b>CRH</b> <b>neurons,</b> suggesting that the inhibitory effect of PRL on hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis activity reported in vivo is indirect and probably mediated through modulation of afferent pathways to the PVN.

40|$|The stress {{response}} is {{mediated by the}} hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system. Activity of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (<b>CRH)</b> <b>neurons</b> in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) forms {{the basis of the}} activity of the HPA-axis. The <b>CRH</b> <b>neurons</b> induce adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) release from the pituitary, which subsequently causes cortisol release from the adrenal cortex. The <b>CRH</b> <b>neurons</b> co-express vasopressin (AVP) which potentiates the <b>CRH</b> effects. <b>CRH</b> <b>neurons</b> project not only to the median eminence but also into brain areas where they, e. g., regulate the adrenal innervation of the autonomic system and affect mood. The hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system is also involved in {{stress response}}. It releases AVP from the PVN and the supraoptic nucleus (SON) and oxytocin (OXT) from the PVN via the neurohypophysis into the bloodstream. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the hypothalamic clock, is responsible for the rhythmic changes of the stress system. Both centrally released CRH and increased levels of cortisol contribute to the signs and symptoms of depression. Symptoms of depression can be induced in experimental animals by intracerebroventricular injection of CRH. Depression is also a frequent side effect of glucocorticoid treatment and of the symptoms of Cushing's syndrome. The AVP neurons in the hypothalamic PVN and SON are also activated in depression, which contributes to the increased release of ACTH from the pituitary. Increased levels of circulating AVP are also associated with the risk for suicide. The prevalence, incidence and morbidity risk for depression are higher in females than in males and fluctuations in sex hormone levels are considered {{to be involved in the}} etiology. About 40 % of the activated <b>CRH</b> <b>neurons</b> in mood disorders co-express nuclear estrogen receptor (ER) -alpha in the PVN, while estrogen-responsive elements have been found in the CRH gene promoter region, and estrogens stimulate CRH production. An androgen-responsive element in the CRH gene promoter region initiates a suppressing effect on CRH expression. The decreased activity of the SCN is the basis for the disturbances of circadian and circannual fluctuations in mood, sleep and hormonal rhythms found in depression. Neuronal loss was also reported in the hippocampus of stressed or corticosteroid-treated rodents and primates. Because of the inhibitory control of the hippocampus on the HPA-axis, damage to this structure was expected to disinhibit the HPA-axis, and to cause a positive feedforward cascade of increasing glucocorticoid levels over time. This 'glucocorticoid cascade hypothesis' of stress and hippocampal damage was proposed to be causally involved in age-related accumulation of hippocampal damage in disorders like Alzheimer's disease and depression. However, in postmortem studies we could not find the presumed hippocampal damage of steroid overexposure in either depressed patients or in patients treated with synthetic steroids. ...|$|R
40|$|In this postmortem study, we {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions in the hypothalamus {{and the state of}} activity of corticotropin-releasing hormone (<b>CRH)</b> -producing <b>neurons</b> that control the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. A high incidence (15 / 16) of MS lesions was found in the hypothalamus, of which more than 50 % was active, that is, contained activated macrophages. MS patients have increased numbers of CRH-immunoreactive neurons coexpressing vasopressin (CRH/VP neurons), a sign of chronic activation of <b>CRH</b> <b>neurons</b> and increased <b>CRH</b> mRNA expression. Active MS lesions correlated with a low number of hyperactive CRH/VP neurons. High human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -DR, -DP, -DQ expression, a measure for macrophage and microglial activation, correlated with low CRH mRNA expression. The nearer the HLA expression was situated to the <b>CRH</b> <b>neurons,</b> the stronger the inhibiting effect, suggesting that activated microglial cells or macrophages suppress these neurons. The more active MS lesions were present in the hypothalamus, the shorter was the disease duration until the moment of death, indicating an unfavorable course of the disease. Thus, MS patients have a chronically activated CRH system, but, in the subgroup of patients with active MS lesions in the hypothalamus, this activation is impaired and the disease course is wors...|$|R
40|$|During {{multiple}} sclerosis (MS), an inflammatory demyelinating {{disease of the}} central nervous system (CNS), activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is considered to modulate the immune system {{in such a way that}} the probability of recovery from a relapse is increased. In a series of postmortem studies we observed a significant activation of corticotropin releasing hormone (<b>CRH)</b> <b>neurons</b> and increased cortisol in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of MS patients, indicating activation of the HPA axis in this disease. On the other hand, sepsis, while elevating cortisol in control subjects, did not associate with a further increase of cortisol in MS patients. Thus, the activated HPA-system in MS does not respond to an acute inflammatory stimulus. In order to investigate the role of chronic inflammation in the CNS in the activation of the HPA axis in MS, MS lesions in the hypothalamus were quantified and interleukin (IL) - 6 levels in the CSF were determined. There was no difference in IL- 6 levels between MS and control patients. A positive correlation was found between cortisol and IL- 6 in control subjects with sepsis, but not in MS patients with sepsis or MS and control groups without sepsis. Thus, IL- 6 in the CSF of MS patients is not the cause of the activation of the HPA system in MS. We found a remarkably high incidence (95 % of the patients) of MS lesions in the hypothalamus, of which the majority (60 %) were active. The more active lesions were present in the hypothalamus, the shorter the disease duration to the moment of death, indicative of a worse disease course. Preliminary data show suppression of the activation of <b>CRH</b> <b>neurons</b> by active hypothalamic MS lesions. We propose that this suppression of <b>CRH</b> <b>neurons</b> by active hypothalamic MS lesions causes the concomitant unfavorable disease course via an inadequate cortisol response during relapses of M...|$|R
40|$|Retinoids, {{a family}} of {{molecules}} that is derived from vitamin A, {{are involved in a}} complex signaling pathway that regulates gene expression and controls neuronal differentiation in the central nervous system. The physiological actions of retinoids are mainly mediated by retinoic acid receptors. Here we describe the distribution of retinoic acid receptor α (RARα) in the human hypothalamus by immunohistochemistry. RARα immunoreactivity showed a widespread pattern throughout the hypothalamus, with high density in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), paraventricular nucleus (PVN), supraoptic nucleus (SON), infundibular nucleus and medial mamillary nucleus. No staining was observed in the sexually dimorphic nucleus of preoptic area, tuberomamillary nucleus and lateral hypothalamic area. RARα was co-localized with vasopressin (AVP) neurons in the SCN, PVN and SON, and co-localized with corticotropin releasing hormone (<b>CRH)</b> <b>neurons</b> in the PVN. These findings provide a neurobiological basis for the participation of retinoids in the regulation of various hypothalamic functions. As shown earlier, the co-localization of RARα in <b>CRH</b> <b>neurons</b> suggests that retinoids might directly modulate the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis in the PVN, which may have implications for the stress response and its involvement in mood disorders. Functional studies in the other sites of RARα localization have to follow in the futur...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{arginine}} vasotocin (AVT) in birds is involved in physiological homeostasis such as cardiovascular, osmotic regulation as well as reproductive functions. Pertinent to these physiological functions, AVT immunoreactive (-ir) neurons in the hypothalamus have been found associated with hemorrhage, dehydration, oviposition and other physiological regulation. Evidence, however, suggests that AVT also plays significant roles in modulating behavior, memory, stress, and food intake. This dissertation research addresses the latter two neuroendocrine functions of AVT in detail within the chicken brain. First, the functional role of AVT-ir neurons in conjunction with corticotropin releasing hormone (<b>CRH)</b> -ir <b>neurons</b> in the neuroendocrine regulation of stress is elucidated in meat type chickens. The results from research showed that a distinct type of AVT neurons (parvocellular - small sized) in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus is activated in response to acute and chronic stress. Furthermore, in order to facilitate the neuroendocrine regulation of stress in chickens, expression of AVT in the PVN occurs in the latter phase of the stress period compared to earlier activity of CRH when birds are exposed to a stressor. Second, the neuromodulatory role of AVT to activate <b>CRH</b> <b>neurons</b> via vasotocin receptors (V 1 aR) within the avian brain is addressed. The results suggests that AVT could augment stress response by modulating CRH neuronal activity in a septal nucleus called the nucleus of the hippocampal commissure (NHpC). Third, the functional role of AVT via the V 1 aR in food intake regulation is characterized. Results show the association of AVT neurons (magnocellular – large sized), in the preoptic and hypothalamic brain structures, and <b>CRH</b> <b>neurons,</b> in the NHpC, following food intake in chickens. Hence, neuroendocrine regulations of AVT neurons in distinct brain structures in the stress response and food intake in chickens are characterized by this dissertation research...|$|R

The mechanism of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis inhibition by DMI in humans is unknown.

40|$|Abstract Background Gap {{junction}} proteins, connexins, {{are expressed}} in most endocrine and exocrine glands {{in the body and}} are at least in some glands crucial for the hormonal secretion. To what extent connexins {{are expressed in}} neurons releasing hormones or neuropeptides from or within the central nervous system is, however, unknown. Previous studies provide indirect evidence for gap junction coupling between subsets of neuropeptide-containing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. Here we employ double labeling and retrograde tracing methods to investigate to what extent neuroendocrine and neuropeptide-containing neurons of the hypothalamus and brainstem express the neuronal gap junction protein connexin 36. Results Western blot analysis showed that connexin 36 is expressed in the PVN. In bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mice, which specifically express the reporter gene Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) {{under the control of the}} connexin 36 gene promoter, EGFP expression was detected in magnocellular (neuroendocrine) and in parvocellular neurons of the PVN. Although no EGFP/connexin 36 expression was seen in neurons containing oxytocin or vasopressin, EGFP/connexin 36 was found in subsets of PVN neurons containing corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), and in somatostatin neurons located along the third ventricle. Moreover, <b>CRH</b> <b>neurons</b> in brainstem areas, including the lateral parabrachial nucleus, also expressed EGFP/connexin 36. Conclusion Our data indicate that connexin 36 is expressed in subsets of neuroendocrine and <b>CRH</b> <b>neurons</b> in specific nuclei of the hypothalamus and brainstem. </p...|$|R
40|$|The central {{nucleus of}} the {{amygdala}} (CeA) {{is known to be}} involved in the regulation of autonomic, neuroendocrine and behavioural responses in stress situations. The CeA contains large numbers of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) cell bodies. Neuroanatomical studies revealed that the majority of the CRH fibres from the CeA have direct connections with autonomic regulatory nuclei in the brainstem. In the present study, the effects of locally infused CRH (30 ng) into the CeA, in freely moving male Wistar rats under stress-free conditions, were examined. Heart rate, endocrine parameters and behavioural activity were repeatedly measured before, during and after local administration of CRH, pretreated with either artificial CSF or the CRH-receptor antagonist, alpha-helical CRH (alpha-hCRH). CRH infusion alone caused a long-lasting increase in heart rate without affecting plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline as indicators of sympathetic activity. This CRH-induced tachycardia was effectively blocked by pretreatment with a high dose (I mug) alpha-hCRH locally into the CeA, while the pretreatment with low dose (0. 1 mug) of the alpha-hCRH caused a minor blockade of the CRH-induced tachycardia. The results suggest that CRH mechanisms in the CeA regulate the autonomic changes probably only by affecting parasympathetic but not sympathetic output systems. Because CRH is given at the level of the cell body of the <b>CRH</b> <b>neurons</b> in the CeA, we suggest that the reduction of the parasympathetic output may be explained as an autoreceptor-mediated inhibition of <b>CRH</b> <b>neurons</b> from the CeA with parasympathetic-regulating brainstem nuclei...|$|R
40|$|The {{release of}} adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) from the corticotrophs is {{controlled}} principally by vasopressin and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). Oxytocin may augment {{the release of}} ACTH under certain conditions, whereas atrial natriuretic peptide acts as a corticotropin release-inhibiting factor to inhibit ACTH release by direct action on the pituitary. Glucocorticoids act on their receptors within the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland to suppress the release of vasopressin and CRH {{and the release of}} ACTH in response to these neuropeptides. <b>CRH</b> <b>neurons</b> in the paraventricular nucleus also project to the cerebral cortex and subcortical regions and to the locus ceruleus (LC) in the brain stem. Cortical influences via the limbic system and possibly the LC augment CRH release during emotional stress, whereas peripheral input by pain and other sensory impulses to the LC causes stimulation of the noradrenergic neurons located there that project their axons to the <b>CRH</b> <b>neurons</b> stimulating them by alpha-adrenergic receptors. A muscarinic cholinergic receptor is interposed between the alpha-receptors and nitric oxidergic interneurons which release nitric oxide that activates CRH release by activation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate, cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase and epoxygenase. Vasopressin release during stress may be similarly mediated. Vasopressin augments the release of CRH from the hypothalamus and also augments the action of CRH on the pituitary. CRH exerts a positive ultrashort loop feedback to stimulate its own release during stress, possibly by stimulating the LC noradrenergic neurons whose axons project to the paraventricular nucleus to augment the release of CRH...|$|R
40|$|Paraventricular {{hypothalamic}} (PVH) corticotropin-releasing hormone (<b>CRH)</b> neuroendocrine <b>neurons</b> mount neurosecretory and transcriptional {{responses to}} glycemic challenges [intravenous 2 -deoxyglucose (2 -DG) or insulin]. Although these responses require signals from intact afferents originating from hindbrain CA (catecholaminergic) neurons, {{the identity of}} these signals and the mechanisms by which they are transduced by PVH neurons during glycemic challenge remain unclear. Here, we tested whether the prototypical catecholamine, norepinephrine (NE), can reproduce PVH neuroendocrine responses to glycemic challenge. Because these responses include phosphorylation of p 44 / 42 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases [extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 / 2 (ERK 1 / 2) ], we also determined whether NE activates ERK 1 / 2 in PVH neurons and, if so, by what mechanism. We show that systemic insulin and 2 -DG, and PVH-targeted NE microinjections, rapidly elevated PVH phospho-ERK 1 / 2 levels. NE increased Crh and c-fos expression, together with circulating ACTH/corticosterone. However, because injections also increased c-Fos mRNA in other brain regions, we used hypothalamic slices maintained in vitro to clarify whether NE activates PVH neurons without contribution of inputs from distal regions. In slices, bath-applied NE triggered robust phospho-ERK 1 / 2 immunoreactivity in PVH (including <b>CRH)</b> <b>neurons,</b> which attenuated markedly {{in the presence of}} the � 1 adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin, or the MAP kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor, U 0126 (1, 4 -diamino- 2, 3 -dicyano- 1, 4 -bis[2 -aminophenylthio]butadiene).

40|$|RFamide-related peptide- 3 (RFRP- 3) is a {{recently}} discovered neuropeptide {{that has been}} proposed {{to play a role}} in the stress response. We aimed to elucidate the role of RFRP- 3 and its receptor, NPFF 1 R, in modulation of stress and anxiety responses. To achieve this, we developed a new NPFF 1 R antagonist, since our results showed that the only commercially available putative antagonist, RF 9 is in fact an agonist at both NPFF 1 R and the kisspeptin receptor, KISS 1 R. We report here the identification and pharmacological characterization of GJ 14, a true NPFFR antagonist. In in vivo tests of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function, GJ 14 completely blocked RFRP- 3 -induced corticosterone release and neuronal activation in corticotropin-releasing hormone (<b>CRH)</b> <b>neurons.</b> Furthermore, chronic infusion of GJ 14 led to anxiolytic-like behavior while RFRP- 3 infusion had anxiogenic effects. Mice receiving chronic RFRP- 3 infusion also had higher basal circulating corticosterone levels. These results indicate a stimulatory action of RFRP- 3 on the HPA axis, consistent with the dense expression of NPFF 1 R in the vicinity of <b>CRH</b> <b>neurons.</b> Importantly, co-infusion of RFRP- 3 and GJ 14 completely reversed the anxiogenic and HPA axis-stimulatory effects of RFRP- 3. Here, we have established the role of RFRP- 3 as a regulator of stress and anxiety. We also show that GJ 14 can reverse the effects of RFRP- 3 both in vitro and in vivo.

40|$|The hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is {{the major}} neuroendocrine stress {{response}} system. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (<b>CRH)</b> <b>neurons</b> in the parvocellular paraventricular nucleus (pPVN) {{play a key role}} in coordinating responses of this system to stressors. The cytokine interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta), mimicking infection, robustly activates these <b>CRH</b> <b>neurons</b> via a noradrenergic input arising from the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS). In late pregnancy, HPA axis responses to stressors, including IL- 1 beta, are attenuated by a central opioid mechanism that auto-inhibits noradrenaline release in the PVN. Here we show that the neuroactive progesterone metabolite allopregnanolone induces these changes in HPA responsiveness to IL- 1 beta in pregnancy. In late pregnancy, inhibition of 5 alpha-reductase (an allopregnanolone-synthesizing enzyme) with finasteride restored HPA axis responses (rapidly increased pPVN CRH mRNA expression, ACTH, and corticosterone secretion) to IL- 1 beta. Conversely, allopregnanolone reduced HPA responses in virgin rats. In late pregnancy, activity of the allopregnanolone-synthesizing enzymes (5 alpha-reductase and 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) was increased in the hypothalamus as was mRNA expression in the NTS and PVN. Naloxone, an opioid antagonist, restores HPA axis responses to IL- 1 beta in pregnancy but had no additional effect after finasteride, indicating a causal connection between allopregnanolone and the endogenous opioid mechanism. Indeed, allopregnanolone induced opioid inhibition over HPA responses to IL- 1 beta in virgin rats. Furthermore, in virgin rats, allopregnanolone treatment increased, whereas in pregnant rats finasteride decreased proenkephalin-A mRNA expression in the NTS. Thus, in pregnancy, allopregnanolone induces opioid inhibition over HPA axis responses to immune challenge. This novel opioid-mediated mechanism of allopregnanolone action may alter regulation of other brain systems in pregnancy...|$|R
