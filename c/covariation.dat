5|$|Joint {{attention}} {{is an important}} mechanism through which children learn to map words-to-world, and vice versa. Adults commonly make an attempt to establish joint attention with a child before they convey something to the child. Joint {{attention is}} often accompanied by physical co-presence, since children are often focused on what is in their immediate environment. As well, conversational co-presence is likely to occur; the caregiver and child typically talk together about whatever is taking place at their locus of joint attention. Social pragmatic perspectives often present children as <b>covariation</b> detectors, who simply associate the words that they hear with whatever they are attending to {{in the world at}} the same time. The co-variation detection model of joint attention seems problematic when we consider that many caregiver utterances do not refer to things that occupy the immediate attentional focus of infants. For instance, caregivers among the Kaluli, a group of indigenous peoples living in New Guinea, rarely provide labels {{in the context of their}} referents. While the <b>covariation</b> detection model emphasizes the caregiver's role in the meaning-making process, some theorists argue that infants also play an important role in their own word learning, actively avoiding mapping errors. When infants are in situations where their own attentional focus differs from that of a speaker, they seek out information about the speaker's focus, and then use that information to establish correct word-referent mappings. Joint attention can be created through infant agency, in an attempt to gather information about a speaker's intent.|$|E

40|$|Peaks in {{spike train}} correlograms are usually taken as {{indicative}} of spike timing synchronization between neurons. Strictly speaking, however, a peak merely {{indicates that the}} two spike trains were not independent. Two biologically plausible ways of departing from independence {{that are capable of}} generating peaks very similar to spike timing peaks are described here: <b>covariations</b> over trials in response latency and <b>covariations</b> over trials in neuronal excitability. Since peaks due to these interactions can be similar to spike timing peaks, interpreting a correlogram may be a problem with ambiguous solutions. What peak shapes do latency or excitability interactions generate? When are they similar to spike timing peaks? When can they be ruled out from having caused an observed correlogram peak?

40|$|Most of our {{knowledge}} about the functional organization of neuronal systems {{is based on the}} analysis of the firing patterns of individual neurons that have been recorded one by one in succession. This approach permits assessment of event related variations in discharge rate but it precludes detection of any <b>covariations</b> in the amplitude or timing of distributed responses if these <b>covariations</b> result from internal neuronal interactions rather than from time locking to stimulus or motor event. As it is likely that internal coordination of distributed responses is functionally as relevant as stimulus induced coordination, multi-electrode recordings have been used to analyse internally generated <b>covariations</b> of firing patterns. More than a decade ago we used this method to reveal that neurons in the visual cortex tend to synchronize their discharges with a precision in the millisecond range when activated with a single contour (Gray and Singer, 1987, 1989) while they fail to do so when activated by different contours moving in different directions (Gray et al., 1989; Engel et al, 1991 c).

40|$|Analysis of 100 {{complete}} sets of the cytoplasmic elongator tRNA {{genes from}} Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya pointed to correspondences between types of anticodon {{and composition of}} the rest of the tRNA body. The number of the hydrogen bonds formed between the complementary nucleotides in the anticodon–codon duplex appeared as a major quantitative parameter determining <b>covariations</b> in all three domains of life. Our analysis has supported and advanced the “extended anticodon” concept that is based on the argument that the decoding performance of the anticodon is enhanced by selection of a matching anticodon stem–loop sequence, as reported by Yarus in 1982. In addition to the anticodon stem–loop, we have found <b>covariations</b> between the anticodon nucleotides and the composition of the distant regions of their respective tRNAs that include dihydrouridine (D) and thymidyl (T) stem–loops. The majority of the covariable tRNA positions were found at the regions with the increased dynamic potential—such as stem–loop and stem–stem junctions.

40|$|Aerosol-cloud {{interactions}} {{have the}} potential to modify many different cloud properties. There is significant uncertainty in the strength of these aerosol-cloud interactions in analyses of observational data, partly due to the difficulty in separating aerosol effects on clouds from correlations generated by local meteorology. The relationship between aerosol and cloud fraction (CF) is particularly important to determine, due to the strong correlation of CF to other cloud properties and its large impact on radiation. It has also been one of the hardest to quantify from satellites due to the strong meteorological <b>covariations</b> involved. This work presents a new method to analyze the relationship between aerosol optical depth (AOD) and CF. By including information about the cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC), the impact of the meteorological <b>covariations</b> is significantly reduced. This method shows that much of the AOD-CF correlation is explained by relationships other than that mediated by CDNC. By accounting for these, the strength of the global mean AOD-CF relationship is reduced by around 80 %. This suggests {{that the majority of the}} AOD-CF relationship is due to meteorological <b>covariations,</b> especially in the shallow cumulus regime. Requiring CDNC to mediate the AOD-CF relationship implies an effective anthropogenic radiative forcing from an aerosol influence on liquid CF of − 0. 48 W m− 2 (− 0. 1 to − 0. 64 W m− 2), although some uncertainty remains due to possible biases in the CDNC retrievals in broken cloud scenes...|$|R
