50|$|A rod end bearing, {{also known}} as a heim joint (N. America) or rose joint (U.K. and elsewhere), is a {{mechanical}} articulating joint. Such joints are used on the ends of control rods, steering links, tie rods, or anywhere a precision articulating joint is required, and where a <b>clevis</b> <b>end</b> (which requires perfect 90 degree alignment between the attached shaft and the second component) is unsuitable. A ball swivel with an opening through which a bolt or other attaching hardware may pass is pressed into a circular casing with a threaded shaft attached. The threaded portion may be either male or female. The heim joint's advantage is that the ball insert permits the rod or bolt passing through it to be misaligned to a limited degree (an angle other than 90 degrees). A link terminated in two heim joints permits misalignment of their attached shafts (viz., other than 180 degrees) when used in tension. When used in compression, the through-rods are forced to the extreme ends of their ball's misalignment range, which cocks the link at an oblique angle.|$|E
40|$|A load {{regulating}} mechanical latch {{is described}} {{that has a}} pivotally mounted latch element having a hook-shaped end with a strike roller-engaging laterally open hook for engaging a stationary strike roller. The latch element or hook is pivotally mounted in a <b>clevis</b> <b>end</b> of an elongated latch stem that is adapted for axial movement through an opening in a support plate or bracket mounted to a structural member. A coil spring is disposed over and around the extending latch stem and {{the lower end of}} the coil spring engages the support bracket. A thrust washer is removably attached to the other end of the latch stem and engages the other end of the coil spring and compresses the coil spring thereby preloading the spring and the latch element carried by the latch stem. The hook-shaped latch element has a limited degree of axial travel for loading caused by structural distortion which may change the relative positions of the latch element hook and the strike roller. Means are also provided to permit limited tilt of the latch element due to loading of the hook...|$|E
40|$|An {{automated}} {{inspection system}} has been developed to inspect the o-ring sealing surfaces on the Space Shuttle reusable solid rocket motor (RSRM) case segment joints. A laser digitizing system is {{used to create a}} three dimensional map of the o-ring sealing surfaces. This data is analyzed for any irregularities, which are noted for further inspection and disposition. This paper describes both the hardware and the software used to gather data as well as the methods developed to analyze the data. The RSRM is assembled from four casting segments. Each of the field joints between these segments is sealed with three o-rings. These o-rings are critical for the proper operation of the motor. After launch the booster segments are recovered and reused. As part of the refurbishment process the o-ring sealing surfaces are inspected for any irregularities. The system developed uses a combination of commercial and customized hardware and software. The system uses two computer systems in a real time environment to control a laser, an XYZ precision table, and case rotation and position information. The system is capable of inspecting both the tang end and the <b>clevis</b> <b>end</b> of the RSRM field joint. The o-ring grooves and flat sealing surfaces are inspected...|$|E
40|$|The SRM PMD is an {{electromechanical}} tool {{used for}} measuring and recording the profile and diameters {{of the solid}} rocket motor segments, both Tang and <b>Clevis</b> <b>ends.</b> This system consists of a crossbeam assembly that mounts to the SRM segment using the existing assembly pin holes. The mounting configuration is such that the tool {{can be used to}} measure Clevis up/Tang down or Clevis up/Tang down. The testing and calibration of the PMD is described...|$|R
50|$|A <b>clevis</b> rod <b>end</b> is {{a folded}} or {{machined}} piece formed into a clevis and {{fitted with a}} hole at its base to which a rod is attached. In machined pieces, the hole is most often threaded.|$|R
40|$|Engineers are {{tasked with}} {{designing}} new systems {{every day to}} meet changing or unexpected technical requirements. After the tragic explosion of the Space Shuttle Challenger on January 28, 1986, NASA engineers embarked on a complete overhaul of many of their long-standing quality systems and procedures. When the official cause of the accident {{was determined to be}} an O-ring failure in the right Solid Rocket Booster, NASA's Shuttle Program initiated a thorough redesign of the rocket boosters' <b>clevis</b> <b>ends,</b> which are the O-ring's mating surfaces. One of the unique systems that NASA engineers developed {{as a result of this}} effort included a heating assembly that is coupled to the outside of the rocket boosters. When the assembly is affixed to the external surface of the boosters, the very nature of its design allows for the warming of the O-rings prior to launch. After the engineers completed the assembly's design, however, they found that it was nearly impossible to tighten the spanner nuts required for attaching the system, given the minimum amount of clearance they had in the limited and confined space. Under these circumstances, the standard wrenches typically used for tightening these types of nuts did not work, and there were no other existing devices to solve the problem. NASA engineers embraced the challenge, developing a torque wrench tool adapter that allowed for a full rotation of spanner nuts in confined spaces. The tool, which is similar to an open-ended crowfoot wrench and a fixed-face spanner wrench, contains two dowel pins that center and lock the wrench onto the nut...|$|R
40|$|Compact, {{manually}} operated mechanical actuator applies controlled, limited tensile or compressive axial force. Designed to apply loads to bearings during wear tests in clean room. Intended to replace hydraulic actuator. Actuator rests on stand and imparts axial force to part attached to clevis inside or below stand. Technician turns control screw {{at one end}} of lever. Depending on direction of rotation of control screw, its end of lever driven downward (for compression) or upward (for tension). Lever pivots about <b>clevis</b> pin at <b>end</b> opposite of control screw; motion drives downward or upward link attached via shearpin at middle of lever. Link drives coupling and, through it, clevis attached to part loaded...|$|R
40|$|A {{landing pad}} system is {{described}} for absorbing {{horizontal and vertical}} impact forces upon engagement with a landing surface where circumferentially arranged landing struts respectively have a clevis which receives a slidable rod member and where the upper portion of a slidable rod member is coupled to the clevis by friction washers which are force fit onto the rod member to provide for controlled constant force energy absorption when the rod member moves relative to the <b>clevis.</b> The lower <b>end</b> of the friction rod is pivotally attached by a ball and socket to a support plate where the support plate is arranged to slide in a transverse direction relative to a housing which contains an energy absorption material for absorbing energy in a transverse direction...|$|R
