Here we systematically explore all stable <b>calcium</b> <b>carbides</b> at pressures from ambient to 100 GPa using variable-composition evolutionary structure predictions using the USPEX code. We find that Ca 5 C 2, Ca 2 C, Ca 3 C 2, CaC, Ca 2 C 3 and CaC 2 have stability fields on the phase diagram. Among these, Ca 2 C and Ca 2 C 3 are successfully synthesized for the first time via high-pressure experiments with excellent structural correspondence to theoretical predictions. Of particular significance is the base-centred monoclinic phase (space group C 2 /m) of Ca 2 C, a quasi-two-dimensional metal with layers of negatively charged calcium atoms, and the primitive monoclinic phase (space group P 21 /c) of CaC with zigzag C 4 groups.

25|$|Carbide lamps, {{also known}} as {{acetylene}} gas lamps, are simple lamps that produce and burn acetylene which is created by the reaction of <b>calcium</b> <b>carbide</b> with water. The first carbide lamp was invented and patented in New York City on August 28, 1900 by Frederick Baldwin.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} bicycle lamps were oil-powered {{and started}} to be manufactured in 1876 for the Ordinary (High-Bicycle) and solid-tired tricycles. From 1896 acetylene gas lighting for bicycles started to be introduced and later in 1899 acetylene gas lamps for the motor-car became popular. Their carbide lamps were powered by acetylene gas, produced by combining <b>calcium</b> <b>carbide</b> with water. The light given was very bright but the lamps required regular maintenance.|$|E
25|$|Carbides {{of varying}} stoichiometries {{are known for}} the {{lanthanides}}. Non-stoichiometry is common. All of the lanthanides form LnC2 and Ln2C3 which both contain C2 units. The dicarbides with exception of EuC2, are metallic conductors with the <b>calcium</b> <b>carbide</b> structure and can be formulated as Ln3+C22−(e–). The C-C bond length is longer than that in CaC2, which contains the C22− anion, indicating that the antibonding orbitals of the C22− anion {{are involved in the}} conduction band. These dicarbides hydrolyse to form hydrogen and a mixture of hydrocarbons. EuC2 {{and to a lesser extent}} YbC2 hydrolyse differently producing a higher percentage of acetylene (ethyne). The sesquicarbides, Ln2C3 can be formulated as Ln4(C2)3. These compounds adopt the Pu2C3 structure which has been described as having C22− anions in bisphenoid holes formed by eight near Ln neighbours. The lengthening of the C-C bond is less marked in the sesquicarbides than in the dicarbides, with the exception of Ce2C3.|$|E

Every few years, we suffer, observe and make some movements on this evil act, and then we forget and forgive. So, where are we heading to? What {{is the future of}} our next generation if this devil is not contained? On the other hand, what is the fate of those who have already consumed adulterated food for most of the time in their life?-we rather say “The answer is blowing in the wind”. Food adulteration has many faces and in our country almost all are being explored & experienced. 1 Use of various chemicals as preservatives, coloring agents, artificial ripening agents and many more are observed all around the country. Mostly we talk about using formalin as preservative in fish, meat and milk. A large amount of fishes are imported to our country from the neighboring countries like Myanmar. 2 The fish dealers use formalin at this transportation process in a view to keep them look fresh and prevent decomposition. Formalin is also being used in fruits to prevent decomposition and make them look attractive and fresh. A common observation by the consumers is, flies don’t wonder around formalin mixed food items. Many of the fruits like mangoes, bananas, apple, grapes and litchis are now medicated with formalin. It’s hard to find rotten fruits in fruit markets now-a-days. The hazard of using formalin affects both the food handlers and the consumers. It can cause irritation of eyes and skin while handling. Also, its inhalation can precipitate or aggravate asthma. 3 Those who consume formalin mixed food items can suffer from kidney diseases, liver cirrhosis or cancer and respiratory illness. They also affect fertility of women and have profound effect on mental and physical growth of children. They are also responsible for blood cancers, anemia and nasopharyngeal cancer. <b>Calcium</b> <b>carbides</b> are used in artificial ripening of fruits which may lead to cancer of different organs like liver, kidney, skin, prostrate or lungs. They contain arsenic and phosphorus and cause gastro-intestinal disorders, vision impairment and irritation of throat, mouse and nose. 5 Milk in our country is distributed as raw and pasteurized form.

40|$|In {{this study}} carbide lime waste {{was used as}} raw {{material}} to produce precipitated <b>calcium</b> carbonate (PCC). <b>Carbide</b> lime is an industrial waste from acetylene gas industry which uses limestone in its production. The use of PCC as fillers in paper making can reduce the production cost and improve the paper properties such as opacity and brightness. PCC can be produced from carbide lime waste by ionic sucrose solution method. The sucrose solution of Brix 10 ° was first prepared by dissolving sugar (sucrose) in water followed by dissolution of carbide lime waste in the sucrose solution. The sucrose solution which had turned milky was then filtered to obtain a clear solution known as pregnant solution. The pregnant solution that contained calcium ions was subsequently used to produce PCC by introducing CO 2 gas into the pregnant solution. The process is known as carbonation. The PCC was then used as fillers in paper making. The production of PCC by using calcium hydroxide as starting material was also carried out for comparison purposes. Based on the results, PCC prepared from carbide lime had purity of 98. 14 % while the one prepared from calcium hydroxide had 98. 66 %. Meanwhile, analysis of the paper properties demonstrated that both products gave equally good results. This proves that PCC prepared from industrial waste {{can be used for}} paper making...|$|R
