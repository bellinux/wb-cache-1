25|$|In <b>colorimetry,</b> CIECAM02 is {{the color}} {{appearance}} model published in 2002 by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) Technical Committee 8-01 (Color Appearance Modelling for Color Management Systems) and the successor of CIECAM97s.|$|E
25|$|The CIE {{assembled}} {{a committee to}} study the matter and accepted the proposal to use the latter approach, which has the virtue of not needing spectrophotometry, {{with a set of}} Munsell samples. Eight samples of varying hue would be alternately lit with two illuminants, and the color appearance compared. Since no color appearance model existed at the time, it was decided to base the evaluation on color differences in a suitable color space, CIEUVW. In 1931, the CIE adopted the first formal system of <b>colorimetry,</b> which is based on the trichromatic nature of the human visual system. CRI is based upon this system of <b>colorimetry.</b>|$|E

25|$|Photographers {{sometimes}} use {{color temperature}} meters. These are usually designed to read only two regions along the visible spectrum (red and blue); more expensive ones read three regions (red, green, and blue). However, they are ineffective with {{sources such as}} fluorescent or discharge lamps, whose light varies in color and may be harder to correct for. Because this light is often greenish, a magenta filter may correct it. More sophisticated <b>colorimetry</b> tools can be used if such meters are lacking.|$|E
25|$|Photometry / {{spectrophotometry}} When the absorbance of {{a specific}} wavelength of light while passing through a fixed path-length through a cuvette of liquid test sample is measured and the absorbance is compared with a blank and standards with graded amounts of the target compound. If the emitted light is {{of a specific}} visible wavelength it may be called <b>colorimetry,</b> or it may involve specific wavelength of light e.g. by use of laser and emission of fluorescent signals of another specific wavelength which is detected via very specific wavelength optical filters.|$|E
25|$|The NTSC and PAL TV norms {{call for}} a {{compliant}} TV screen to display an electrically black and white signal (minimal color saturation) at a color temperature of 6500K. On many consumer-grade televisions, {{there is a very}} noticeable deviation from this requirement. However, higher-end consumer-grade televisions can have their color temperatures adjusted to 6500K by using a preprogrammed setting or a custom calibration. Current versions of ATSC explicitly call for the color temperature data {{to be included in the}} data stream, but old versions of ATSC allowed this data to be omitted. In this case, current versions of ATSC cite default <b>colorimetry</b> standards depending on the format. Both of the cited standards specify a 6500K color temperature.|$|E
25|$|Although Jaffe's name {{is synonymous}} with {{clinical}} creatinine testing, his paper only described the principle behind what would later become the enduring method. It was Otto Folin (1867–1934), a Harvard biochemist, who adapted Jaffe's research—abandoning the standard Neubauer reaction of the time—and published several papers using the Jaffe reaction to analyze creatinine levels in both blood and urine. Folin began using the picric acid procedure in 1901 and included it in his 1916 Lab Manual of Biological Chemistry. During his career, Folin modified and improved several quantitative colorimetric procedures, {{the first of which}} was for creatinine. He took advantage of technology available at the time, using a Duboscq colorimeter for measurement precision, and is credited for introducing <b>colorimetry</b> into modern biochemical analysis.|$|E

This specification was upheld by a decree of December 7, 1955.

2500|$|A {{solution}} of aquacyano-corrinoids, such as cobalamin or cobinamide, reacts with free cyanide {{in an aqueous}} sample. The binding of cyanide to the corrinoid cobalt center leads to a color change from orange to violet, allowing for semi-quantification by naked-eye. Precise quantification of the cyanide content is feasible by UV-vis spectroscopy. Absorption of the corrinoid on a solid phase, allows detection of cyanide even in colored samples, rendering this method appropriate {{for the analysis of}} cyanide in water, wastewater, blood, and food. [...] Furthermore, this technology is non-toxic and considerably less prone to interference than the pyridine-barbituric acid <b>colorimetry</b> method.|$|E

50|$|Absolute <b>colorimetry</b> and {{relative}} <b>colorimetry</b> actually {{use the same}} table but differ in the adjustment for the white point media. If the output device has a much larger gamut than the source profile, i.e., all the colors in the source can be represented in the output, using the absolute <b>colorimetry</b> rendering intent would ideally (ignoring noise, precision, etc.) give an exact output of the specified CIELAB values. Perceptually, the colors may appear incorrect, but instrument measurements of the resulting output would match the source. Colors outside of the proof print system's possible color are mapped to the boundary of the color gamut.|$|E
