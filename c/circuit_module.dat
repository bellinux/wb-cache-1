5000|$|Testing: To achieve high {{overall yield}} and reduce costs, {{separate}} testing of independent dies is essential. However, tight integration between adjacent active layers in 3D ICs entails {{a significant amount}} of interconnect between different sections of the same <b>circuit</b> <b>module</b> that were partitioned to different dies. Aside from the massive overhead introduced by required TSVs, sections of such a module, e.g., a multiplier, cannot be independently tested by conventional techniques. This particularly applies to timing-critical paths laid out in 3D.|$|E
5000|$|Data {{flows from}} one circuit element to another using [...] "handshakes", or {{sequences}} of voltage transitions to indicate readiness to receive data, or readiness to offer data. Typically, inputs of a <b>circuit</b> <b>module</b> will indicate their readiness to receive, {{which will be}} [...] "acknowledged" [...] by the connected output by sending data (encoded {{in such a way}} that the receiver can detect the validity directly), and once that data has been safely received, the receiver will explicitly acknowledge it, allowing the sender to remove the data, thus completing the handshake, and allowing another datum to be transmitted.|$|E
50|$|The Quad Digital Audio Processor (QDAP) was a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) based {{printed circuit}} card {{designed}} at Computer Consoles Inc. (CCI) in Rochester, NY.

The main function of the card was the processing of incoming digital audio to detect the speech patterns using speaker independent speech recognition. The CCI digital switch was deployed as part of the Digital Audio Intercept System (DAIS II), Automatic Voice Response (AVR), and Interactive Voice System (IVS) products. The initial QDAP board is notable for introducing speech recognition into the public telephone network to automate the handling of operator assisted telephone calls.|$|E

40|$|Mammalian motor {{behavior}} is enabled by {{a hierarchy of}} interleaved <b>circuit</b> <b>modules</b> constructed by interneurons in the spinal cord, sensory feedback loops, and bilateral communication with supraspinal centers. Neuronal subpopulations are specified {{through a process of}} precisely timed neurogenesis, acquisition of transcriptional programs, and migration to spatially confined domains. Developmental and genetic programs instruct stereotyped and highly specific connectivity patterns, binding functionally distinct neuronal subpopulations into motor <b>circuit</b> <b>modules</b> at all hierarchical levels. Recent work demonstrates that spatial organization of motor circuits relates to precise connectivity patterns and that these patterns frequently correlate with specific behavioral functions of motor output.

50|$|Things {{are never}} that simple, however. Pipelining {{requires}} that the unit's internals can be effectively separated {{to the point where}} each step of the operation is running on completely separate circuitry. This is rarely achievable in the real world. Nevertheless, the use of pipelining on the 7600 improved performance over the 6600 by a factor of about 3. For the rest of the goal, the machine would have to run at a faster speed, now possible using new transistor designs. However, there is a physical limit to performance based on the time it takes signals to move between parts of the machine, which in turn is defined by its physical size. As always, Cray's design work spend considerable effort on this problem and thus allow higher operating frequencies. For the 7600 each <b>circuit</b> <b>module</b> actually consisted of up to six printed circuit boards, each one stuffed with subminiature resistors, diodes, and transistors. The six boards were stacked up and then interconnected along their edges, making for a very compact, but basically unrepairable module.|$|E

This study presented a portable micro-electrochemical system for detection of cancer cells by measuring electrochemical behaviors of molecule probe. The relevant hardware was divided into three parts, i. e., MCU <b>circuit</b> <b>module,</b> current measuring <b>circuit</b> <b>module</b> and potentiostatic <b>circuit</b> <b>module.</b> Information between modules exchanged through the system bus. The software was designed for generating and acquisition of signals, communication between master and slave, and data analysis.

40|$|Over {{the years}} {{different}} interpretations of Rent's rule and {{different ways of}} estimating the Rent parameters have emerged. In general, these parameters are extracted from the average terminal-gate relationship {{for a set of}} <b>circuit</b> <b>modules.</b> We show that this relationship (the Rent characteristic) strongly depends on the definition of the <b>circuit</b> <b>modules.</b> These can be generated in many different ways, either from the topology of the circuit graph or, in a geometric way, by cutting regions from a circuit layout. The resulting Rent parameters can be quite far apart. This paper discusses the fundamental differences between the topological and the two geometric interpretations of the Rent characteristic that are expected to be most appropriate for current wirelength estimation techniques. Our discussion is based on experimental data, as well as on a theoretical model {{that can be used to}} estimate certain geometric Rent characteristics from the topological Rent parameters. Using this model, we derive a theoretical lower limit to the value of the average geometric Rent exponent. We also study the impact of the placement approach and placement quality on the geometric Rent characteristics...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{developed}} a novel heart rate (HR) monitoring approach in which we measure the pressure variance of {{the surface of the}} ear canal. A scissor-shaped apparatus equipped with a piezoelectric film sensor and a hardware <b>circuit</b> <b>module</b> was designed for high wearability and to obtain stable measurement. In the proposed device, the film sensor converts in-ear pulse waves (EPW) into electrical current, and the <b>circuit</b> <b>module</b> enhances the EPW and suppresses noise. A real-time algorithm embedded in the <b>circuit</b> <b>module</b> performs morphological conversions to make the EPW more distinct and knowledge-based rules are used to detect EPW peaks. In a clinical experiment conducted using a reference electrocardiogram (ECG) device, EPW and ECG were concurrently recorded from 58 healthy subjects. The EPW intervals between successive peaks and their corresponding ECG intervals were then compared to each other. Promising results were obtained from the samples, specifically, a sensitivity of 97. 25 %, positive predictive value of 97. 17 %, and mean absolute difference of 0. 62. Thus, highly accurate HR was obtained from in-ear pressure variance. Consequently, we believe that our proposed approach could be used to monitor vital signs and also utilized in diverse applications in the near future...|$|E
