The {{newspaper}} [...] "Izvestiya Ulanbator khoto" [...] reported on July 15, 1925 that [...] "in line with Mongolian tradition the fourth anniversary of the People's Revolution was celebrated with rallies at the square dedicated to D.Sükhbaatar".

A detection method of these defects was studied utilizing the multi-sensors Prognostic and Health Management (PHM) theory. Aiming at these process defects, {{the reasons that}} lead to defects are analyzed in this paper. In the meanwhile, the key process parameters were determined and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) tests during the cure process of resin cementing were carried out. At the same time, {{in order to get}} data on changing cementing strength, multiple-group <b>cementing</b> <b>process</b> tests of different key process parameters were designed and conducted. A relational model of cementing strength and cure temperature, time and pressure was established, by combining data of DSC and process tests as well as based on the Avrami formula. Through sensitivity analysis for three process parameters, the on-line detection decision criterion and the process parameters which have obvious impact on cementing strength were determined. A PHM system with multiple temperature and pressure sensors was established on this basis, and then, on-line detection, diagnosis and control for ferrite phase shifter <b>cementing</b> <b>process</b> defects were realized. It was verified by subsequent process that the on-line detection system improved the reliability of the ferrite phase shifter <b>cementing</b> <b>process</b> and reduced the incidence of insufficient cementing strength defects...|$|E

40|$|Down-hole damages such as {{borehole}} collapse, {{circulation loss}} and rock tensile/compressive cracking in the open-hole system are well understood at drilling and well completion stages. However, less {{effort has been}} made to understand the instability of cemented sections in High Pressure High Temperature (HPHT) wells. The existing analysis shows that, in the perforation zones, casing/cement is subject to instability, particularly in the presence of cavities. This dissertation focuses on the instability mechanism of casing/cement in the non-perforated zones. We investigate the transient thermal behavior in the casing-cement-formation system resulting from the movement of wellbore fluid using finite element method. The critical value of down-hole stresses is identified in both wellbore heating and cooling effects. Differently with the heating effect, the strong cooling effect in a cased hole can produce significant tension inside casing/cement. The confining formation has an obvious influence on the stability of casing/cement. The proposed results reveal that the casing/cement system in the non-homogeneous formation behaves differently from that in homogeneous formation. With this in mind, a three-dimensional layered finite element model is developed to illustrate the casing/cement mechanical behavior in the non-homogeneous formation. The radial stress of cement sheath is found to be highly variable and affected by the contrast in Young?s moduli in the different formation layers. The maximum stress is predicted to concentrate in the casing-cement system confined by the sandstone. Casing wear in the cased-hole system causes significant casing strength reduction, possibly resulting in the casing-cement tangential collapse. In this study, an approach for calculating the stress concentration in the worn casing with considering temperature change is developed, based on boundary superposition. The numerical results indicate that the casing-cement system after casing wear will suffer from severe tangential instability due to the elevated compressive hoop stress. Gas migration during the <b>cementing</b> <b>process</b> results from the fluid cement?s inability to balance formation pore pressure. Past experience emphasized the application of chemical additives to reduce or control gas migration during the <b>cementing</b> <b>process.</b> This report presents the thermal and mechanical behaviors in a cased hole caused by created gas channels after gas migration. In conclusion, the size and the number of gas channels are two important factors in determining mechanical instability in a casing-cement system...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA new in situ {{experiment}} is proposed for observing and understanding well integrity evolution, potentially due to changes that could occur during a well lifetime. The focus {{is put on}} temperature and pressure stresses. A small section of a well is reproduced at scale 1 : 1 in the Opalinus Clay formation, representative of a low permeable caprock formation (in Mont Terri Underground Rock Laboratory, Switzerland). The well-system behavior is characterized over time both by performing hydro-tests to quantify the hydraulic properties of the well and their evolution, and sampling the fluids to monitor the chemical composition and its changes. This paper presents the well integrity assessment under different imposed temperature (17 - 52 degrees C) and pressure (10 - 28 bar) conditions. The results obtained in this study confirm {{the ability of the}} chosen design and observation scale to estimate the evolution of the well integrity over time, the characteristics of the flow along the well-system and the reasons of the observed evolution. In particular, the estimated effective well permeability is higher than cement or caprock intrinsic permeability, which suggest preferential flow pathways at interfaces especially {{at the very beginning of}} the experiment; the significant variations of the effective well permeability observed after setting pressure and temperature stresses indicate that operations could influence well integrity in similar proportions than the <b>cementing</b> <b>process...</b>|$|E

Accident reports are analyzed, human factors are studied in depth and the companies are investigated, after the incident has occurred. An improved method of evaluation is now under consideration, which has the potential of being run in real-time and obtain an immediate pre-assessment of the failure. This method is based on a knowledge model of the drilling process, where all concepts involved in the process are structured in hierarchical categories, based on established knowledge combined with situation specific experiences.

40|$|Deep {{stabilized}} peat columns {{could be}} considered as attractive and economical foundation for construction of highway embankments on deep peat ground. However, peat itself is very problematic and failure {{in the formation of}} the columns with adequate strength was often attributed to unsuitable type and insufficient dosage of binder added to the organic soil. Organic matter in peat was known to impede the <b>cementing</b> <b>process</b> in the soil, thus, retarding the early strength gain of stabilized peat. To evaluate the strength characteristics of stabilized peat, laboratory investigation on early strength gain of the stabilized soil was conducted to formulate a suitable and economical mix design that can be effectively used for the soil stabilization. To achieve such purpose, the study examined the effect of binder, sodium chloride as cement accelerator and silica sand as filler on the unconfined compressive strength of stabilized peat after 7 days of curing in water. Binders used to stabilize the peat were Ordinary Portland cement, ground granulated blast furnace slag, sodium bentonite, kaolinite, lime and bentonite. All the stabilized peat specimens were tested using unconfined compression apparatus. The test results revealed that the stabilized peat specimen (80 OPC: 10 GGBS: 10 SB) with addition of 4 sodium chloride by weight of binder and 50 well graded silica sand by volume of wet peat at 300 kg m - 3 binder dosage yielded the highest unconfined compressive strength of 196 kPa. This implied that, the higher the dosage of silica sand in stabilized peat, the more solid particles will be available for the binder to unite and form a load sustainable stabilized peat. It could be summarized that, as the rate of hydration process of stabilized peat was accelerated by inclusion of sodium chloride, the solid particles contributed to the hardening of stabilized peat by providing the cementation bonds to form between contact points of the particles...|$|E
