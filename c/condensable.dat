40|$|In such {{fields as}} {{cleanroom}} technology for space applications, semiconductor and optics, the {{indoor air quality}} (IAQ) in these controlled environments need to be assessed {{for the presence of}} molecular organic contaminants (MOC) in order to permit clean device surfaces during the entire construction and assembly period. Especially high boiling MOC such as phthalates, organic esters, siloxanes and hydrocarbons may emit constantly from building and construction materials and later condense on critical surfaces. Therefore, extensive MOC material emission screening measurements of different types of cleanroom building products according to a new standard ISO/WD 14644 - 15 were performed. All obtained surface specific emission rates are entered into a public available database in order to enable a material selection already in the planning phase of a low-emission controlled environment. Therefore, a simulation model for cleanroom settings predicts the expected level of MOC of the environment to be constructed. New cleanroom settings for space applications and research with a very high IAQ regarding MOC are planned and built based on a targeted material selection using the database values and the simulation tool. The presence of critical <b>condensables</b> was quantified on selected cleanroom settings using especially designed condensation witness samples which are later analysed by transmission Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) purged with ultrapure VOC-filtered air based on EN 16602 - 70 - 05. As a result, a condensation rate is calculated for the individual sampling sites. A more detailed species analysis of the collected <b>condensables</b> is done by thermal extraction of witness samples in a micro emission chamber and subsequent analysis using automated thermodesorption coupled with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (ATD-GC/MS) based on a slightly adapted method described in ISO 16000 - 25.

40|$|The {{transformation}} of lignocellulosic biomass into bio-based commodity chemicals is technically possible. Among thermochemical processes, fast pyrolysis, a relatively mature technology {{that has now}} reached the commercial level, produces a high yield of an organic-rich liquid stream. Despite the recent efforts in elucidating the degradation paths of biomass pyrolysis, the selectivity and recovery rates of bio-compounds remain low. In an attempt to clarify the general degradation scheme of biomass fast pyrolysis and provide a quantitative insight, this study has combined the use of fast pyrolysis micro-reactors, spectrometric techniques and mixtures of unlabelled and Carbon- 13 enriched materials. The first stage of the work reported aimed at selecting the type of reactor to ensure control of the pyrolysis regime.

40|$|It {{is argued}} that isotope {{analysis}} of atmospheric non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) and, in particular, {{the analysis of the}} deuterium/hydrogen (D/H) ratio is valuable because the dominant self-cleansing property of the troposphere is based on the OH radical which removes, e. g., CH and other alkanes by H-atom abstraction, which induces large kinetic isotope effects. The major obstacle in applying D/H isotope analysis to atmospheric NMHCs is not only the low abundance of D itself but, in particular, the low concentrations of NMHCs in the parts per trillion range. We show how a selection of NMHCs can be quantitatively separated from 300 L air samples together with CO as carrier gas matrix, by using high efficiency cryogenic traps. After diluting the extracted NMHC mixtures with hydrocarbon free air, and determining the mixing ratios, good agreement with original whole air sample analysis exists for alkanes and several halocarbons. For unsaturated hydrocarbons and some other halocarbons the extraction and recovery yield under the given conditions fell considerably, as a function of boiling point. Furthermore, the mixture of NMHCs in the CO matrix is proven to remain unchanged over several years when conveniently stored in glass ampoules. The 'extracts' or 'concentrates' of <b>condensables</b> extracted from larger air samples will enable the D/H isotope analysis of ultra trace gases in the atmosphere.

Different reactivities were observed {{between the three}} biomass components. Cellulose mainly produced <b>condensables</b> and was less dependent on heating rate, while xylan and lignin contributed most char yields and were significantly affected by heating rate. While xylan and lignin pyrolysed over a large temperature range and showed the behaviour characteristic of solid fuels, cellulose decomposition is sharp in a narrow temperature range, a behaviour typical of linear polymers. Comparison of the pyrolysis behaviour of individual components with that of their synthetic mixtures showed that interactions between cellulose {{and the other two}} components take place, but no interaction was found between xylan and lignin. No obvious interaction occurred for synthetic mixtures and lignocellulosic biomass at 325 C, before the beginning of cellulose pyrolysis, in slow and high heating rate. At higher pyrolysis temperatures, more char was obtained for synthetic mixtures containing cellulose compared to the estimated value based on the individual components and their proportions in the mixture. For lignocellulosic biomass, less char and more tar were obtained than predicted from the components, which may be associated with the morphology of samples.

40|$|The {{exoplanet}} Gl 581 d (discovered in 2007) {{is relatively}} low mass and {{near to the}} outer edge of its system's habitable zone, which has led to much speculation on its possible climate. To help understand the possible conditions on this planet, we have developed a new universal 3 D global climate model (GCM). It is derived from the LMD GCMs already used to simulate the Earth, Mars and other terrestrial atmospheres in the solar system, and hence has already been validated over a wide range of physical conditions. We have performed a range of simulations to assess whether, given simple combinations of chemically stable gases (CO 2, H 2 O and N 2), Gl 581 d could sustain liquid water on its surface. Compared to a Sun-like star, the red dwarf Gliese 581 allows higher planetary temperatures, because Rayleigh scattering is reduced. Taking into account the scattering greenhouse effect of both CO 2 and H 2 O clouds, we find that several tens of bars of CO 2 are sufficient to maintain global mean temperatures above the melting point of water. As Gl 581 d is probably in a tidally resonant orbit, <b>condensables</b> such as water and CO 2 may be trapped on its dark sides or poles. However, we find that even with conservative assumptions, redistribution of heat by the atmosphere is enough to allow stable conditions with surface liquid water.

This places Titan and Ganymede in the inner disk, Callisto and Iapetus in the outer disk, and Hyperion in the transition region. The inner disk is the leftover of the gas accreted by the protoplanet. The outer disk results from the solar torque on nebula gas flowing into the protoplanet during the time of giant planet gap opening. For the sake of specificity, we use a cosmic mixture 'minimum mass' model to constrain the gas densities of the inner disks of Jupiter and Saturn (and also Uranus). For the total mass of the outer disk we use the simple scaling M(sub disk) = M(sub P) tau(sub gap) /tau(sub acc), where M(sub P) is the mass of the giant planet, tau(sub gap) is the gap opening timescale, and tau(sub acc) is the giant planet accretion time. This gives a total outer disk mass of approximately 100 M(sub Callisto) for Jupiter and possibly approximately 200 M(sub Iapetus) for Saturn (which contain enough <b>condensables</b> to form Callisto and Iapetus respectively).

40|$|This study {{sought to}} better {{understand}} the torrefaction process, and more specifically, how torrefaction affects the physical and chemical properties of corn stover biomass. The work done to accomplish this was divided into three sections that map to three research objectives. First, effect of torrefaction residence time, temperature and untreated biomass moisture content on chemical properties of torrefied corn stover was addressed. Second, effect of torrefaction process condition on physical characteristics of torrefied biomass, namely hydrophobicity was assessed. In addition, resistance to microbial degradation as a result of torrefaction and increased hydrophobicity was investigated. Third, influence of gas residence time and biomass particle size on chemical characteristics of torrefied corn stover was studied. Corn stover biomass at three moisture contents (30, 45, and 50 % wet basis) was torrefied at three different temperatures (200, 250, and 300 °C), and at three reaction times (10, 20, and 30 min). In each of the 17 treatments elemental and proximate compositions of the torrefied stover was determined, along with the composition of released gaseous and liquid products. Using these data, the mass and energy balance of each torrefaction was quantified. The energy balance accounted only for energy contained in the biomass. As torrefaction process temperature increased, an overall increase (2 - 19 %) in the energy density of torrefied biomass and decrease (3 - 45 % and 1 - 35 % respectively) in mass and energy yield was observed. At 200 ºC, mass and energy losses increased with an increase in the initial biomass moisture content. The difference in both mass and energy losses between biomass of 22 % and 41 % initial moisture content was about 10 percentage points at 200 ºC. The liquid phase condensed from the stream of volatiles was composed primarily of water, followed by acetic acid, methanol, hydroxyacetone, and furfural. The yield of <b>condensables</b> increased with torrefaction temperature. Permanent gas released in the process was mainly composed of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, with traces of hydrogen and methane present only at 300 ºC. The equilibrium moisture content (EMC) of raw corn stover, along with corn stover thermally pretreated at three temperatures, was measured using the static gravimetric method at equilibrium relative humidity (ERH) and temperature ranging from 10 to 98 % and from 10 to 40 °C, respectively. Five isotherms were fitted to the experimental data to obtain the prediction equation which best describes the relationship between the ERH and the EMC of lignocellulosic biomass. Microbial degradation of the samples was tested at 97 % ERH and 30 °C for period of 30 days. Fiber analyses were conducted on all samples. In general, torrefied biomass showed an EMC lower than that of raw biomass, which implied an increase in hydrophobicity. The modified Oswin model performed best in describing the correlation between ERH and EMC. Corn stover torrefied at 250 and 300 °C had negligible dry matter mass loss due to microbial degradation. Fiber analysis showed a significant decrease in hemicellulose content with the increase in pretreatment temperature, which might be the reason for the hydrophobic nature of torrefied biomass. This is probably due to loss of polar hydroxyl groups that serves as binding sites for water molecules. The effects of particle size and gas residence time on the torrefaction of corn stover were investigated via torrefaction of different stover fractions: stalk shell, pith, and corn cob shell, and particle sizes, in a form of whole corn stalk and ground corn stover. Three levels of the purge gas residence times (1. 2, 12 and 60 sec) were employed to assess the effects of volatiles and torrefied biomass interaction. Elemental analyses of all the samples were done, and the obtained data was used to estimate the energy contents and energy yields of different torrefied biomass samples. Particle densities, elemental composition, and fiber composition of raw biomass fractions were also determined. The dry matter losses, higher heating values, and energy yields for different torrefied corn stover fractions were significantly different. This was probably due to the differences in particle densities, hemicellulose quantities, and the chemical and physical properties of the original biomass samples. Gas residence time did not {{have a significant effect on}} the aforementioned parameters...|$|R

The sulphur trioxide decomposition reactor producing sulphur dioxide for the electrolytic cells in a closed loop system has been examined, {{but it is clear that}} development with respect to a more durable active catalyst in a reactor operating under severe conditions needs to be investigated. A suitable sulphur trioxide reactor needs to operate at a high temperature with efficient heating in view of the endothermic reaction, and has to consist of special materials of construction to handle the very corrosive reactants and products. This investigation was undertaken to address (1) the synthesis, characterisation, reactivity and stability of a suitable catalyst (2), determination the reaction rate of the chosen catalyst with a suitable micro reactor (3) construction and evaluation of a packed bed reactor for the required reaction, and (4) the development and validation of a reactor model using computational fluid dynamics with associated chemical reactions. A supported catalyst consisting of 0. 5 wt% platinum and 0. 5 wt% palladium on rutile (TiO 2, titania) was prepared by the sintering of an anatase/rutile supported catalyst with the same noble metal composition, synthesized according to an incipient impregnation procedure using cylindrical porous pellets (± 1. 7 mm diameter and ± 5 mm long). Characterization involving: surface area, porosity, metal composition, - dispersion, - particle size, support phase and sulphur content was carried out and it was found from reactivity determinations that the sintered catalyst, which was very different from the synthesized catalyst, had an acceptable activity and stability which was suitable for further evaluation. A micro pellet reactor was constructed and operated and consisted of a small number of pellets (five) placed apart from each other in a two-stage quartz reactor with sulphur trioxide generated from sulphuric acid in the first stage and the conversion of sulphur trioxide in the second stage, respectively. Attention was only confined to the second stage involving the conversion of sulphur trioxide with the supported catalyst. The overall reaction kinetics of the pellets involving momentum, heat and mass transfer and chemical reaction was evaluated and validated with constants obtained from literature and with an unknown reaction rate equation for which constants were obtained by regression. As result of the complexity of the flow, mass and heat transfer fields in the micro pellet reactor it was necessary to use a CFD model with chemical reactions which was accomplished with a commercial code COMSOL MultiPhysics® 4. 3 b. A reversible reaction rate equation was used and a least squares regression procedure was used to evaluate the activation energy and pre-exponential factor. The activation energy obtained for the first order forward reaction was higher than values obtained from literature for a first order reaction rate (irreversible reaction) for the platinum group metals on titania catalysts. Detailed analyses of the velocity, temperature and concentration profile revealed the importance of using a complex model for determination of the reaction parameters. A fixed bed reactor system consisting of a sulphuric acid vaporizer, a single reactor tube (1 m length, 25 mm OD) heated with a surrounding electrical furnace followed, by a series of condensers for the analysis of the products was constructed and operated. Three process variables were investigated, which included the inlet temperature, the weight hourly velocity and the residence time in order to assess the performance of the reactor and generate results for developing a model. The results obtained included the wall and reactor centreline temperature profiles together with average conversion. As a result of the complexity of the chemistry and the phases present containing the products from the reactor a detailed calculation was done using vapour/liquid equilibrium with the accompanying mass balance (Aspen-Plus®) to determine the distribution of sulphur trioxide, sulphur dioxide, oxygen and steam. A mass balance was successfully completed with analyses including SO 2 with a GC, O 2 with a paramagnetic cell analyser, acid/base titrations with sodium hydroxide, SO 2 titrations with iodine and measurement of <b>condensables</b> (mass and volume). The results obtained showed that a steady state (constant conversion) was obtained after approximately six hours and that it was possible to obtain sulphur trioxide conversion approaching equilibrium conditions for bed lengths of 100 mm with very low weight hourly space velocities. A heterogeneous 2 D model consisting of the relevant continuity, momentum, heat transfer and mass transfer and the reaction rate equation determined in this investigation was developed and solved with the use of the commercial code COMSOL MultiPhysics® 4. 3 b with an appropriate mesh structure. The geometry of the packed bed (geometry) was accomplished by generating a randomly packed bed with a commercial package DigiPac™. The model predicted results that agreed with experimental results with conversions up to 56 %, obtained over the following ranges: weight hourly space velocity equal to 15 h- 1, temperatures between 903 K and 1053 K and residence times between 0. 1 and 0. 07 seconds. The post-processing results were most useful for assessing the effect of the controlling mechanisms and associated parameters. Doctora...|$|R
40|$|Torrefaction is a mild thermal {{pretreatment}} which improves biomass {{properties and}} releases <b>condensable</b> species. <b>Condensable</b> species released during torrefaction of pine, ash wood, miscanthus and wheat straw at 250, 280 and 300 °C were investigated. A fixed-bed reactor {{was used for}} the laboratory scale experiments. A micro-GC, Karl Fischer titrator and GC-MS were used to analyse incondensable gases, water and other <b>condensable</b> species, respectively. The overall mass balance ranged from 96 to 103 wt. %. The quantification rate of <b>condensable</b> species was on average 77 wt. %. In addition to the major species usually reported in the literature – water, acetic acid, 2 -propanone, 1 -hydroxy- – we show that large amounts of some anhydrosugars were produced. Additionally, 85 <b>condensable</b> species were identified. Among these species, many terpenes and terpenoids in pine were identified by adsorption on SPME fibre. Finally, the influence of temperature and of the nature of biomass on the yields of <b>condensable</b> species was highlighted. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|He/H 2 O and He/n-C 5 H 12 permeabilities {{as well as}} single-component permeabilities were {{measured}} on two mesoporous alumina membranes, {{in order to determine}} the optimum conditions for separating <b>condensable</b> from non-condensable vapors. The membranes were produced by compaction of non-porous alumina particles and exhibited similar pore structures but different porosities. The results show that, if the relative pressure of the <b>condensable</b> vapor in the condensable/non-condensable mixture is properly selected, very high selectivity and permeability values can be achieved simultaneously. The optimum relative pressure of the <b>condensable</b> vapor corresponds, in all cases studied, to the maximum <b>condensable</b> vapor permeability and to a relative gas permeability of zero. The pressure gradient of the <b>condensable</b> vapor across the membrane should be kept small, to avoid the formation of low permeability regions at either end of the membrane. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.
