40|$|Abstract: Purpose: This {{systematic}} review update evaluated low level laser therapy (LLLT) for adults with neck pain. Methods: Computerized searches (root up to Feb 2012) included pain, function/disability, {{quality of life}} (QoL) and global perceived effect (GPE). GRADE, effect-sizes, heterogeneity and meta-regression were assessed. Results: Of 17 trials, 10 demonstrated high risk of bias. For chronic neck pain, there was moderate quality evidence (2 trials, 109 participants) supporting LLLT over placebo to improve pain/disability/QoL/GPE up to intermediate-term (IT). For acute radiculopathy, <b>cervical</b> <b>osteoarthritis</b> or acute neck pain, low quality evidence suggested LLLT improves ST pain/function/QoL over a placebo. For chronic myofascial neck pain (5 trials, 188 participants), evidence was conflicting; a meta-regression of heterogeneous trials suggests super-pulsed LLLT increases {{the chance of a}} successful pain outcome. Conclusions: We found diverse evidence using LLLT for neck pain. LLLT may be beneficial for chronic neck pain/function/QoL. Larger long-term dosage trials are needed...|$|E
40|$|My {{interest}} for this problem {{coincided with a}} patient's request {{to do something for}} her. The patient presented a <b>cervical</b> <b>osteoarthritis,</b> with recurrences of cervicalgia, together with inflammatory symptoms: heat, edema, diminished functionality, tissue congestion, pain. After taking anti-inflammatory drugs that were not tolerated by her digestive system, and analgesics that were making her sleepy, the patient gave up her treatment, interrupted her sessions of classical massage, reeducation, physiotherapy, which increased her pain even more, and she got used to the idea that she will always live in pain. A new episode of cervicalgia determined her to ask for help somewhere else. This episode was treated only through lymphatic drainage massage, which really eased her pain, and allowed her to start again the physical therapy, this time with greater ease. Through the absorption and appeal maneuvers, the lymphatic drainage massage allowed the capture of liquids, reestablishing the tissue physiological balance, and contributed to the reconstruction of the damaged tissue, to reducing pain, and to giving back the freedom of movement in the joints, thus allowing a gradual re-adaptation of the cervical spine to movement. In conclusion, the lymphatic drainage massage can be applied as a conservatory, preparatory, and complementary treatment with the therapies that are usually used in the case of cervicalgia...|$|E
5000|$|Likely {{because of}} their work {{grinding}} corn, women had {{a higher incidence of}} elbow joint and <b>cervical</b> vertebrae <b>osteoarthritis</b> than men. Although there were decided status levels at NAN Ranch, there was no noticeable difference in the health of the individuals. It is theorized that there was no great period of starvation, or [...] "food stress", during the Classic Mimbres period sites, including the NAN Ranch. There was evidence of anemia [...] - [...] caused by a low-iron, low-protein maize diet or parasites [...] - [...] due to the incidence of porotic hyperostosis (36.5%), pitting of the cranial bones, and cribra orbitalia (19.2%), pitting on the eye orbit walls. Analysis of teeth show that the people of the community were closely related to those of the Chihuahuan and Sonoran Desert.|$|R
2500|$|The {{underground}} travel of the waters, {{from the}} opposite shore of the lake (more than thirty years at [...] deep), explains its temperature of 46°. Many sources provide calcium, sulphated, silica-rich waters which are very slightly radioactive at 45° or cold, and finally with bicarbonatees. They, according to their origin and their temperature, are used either for showers or baths, in a swimming-pool, or to drink. These warm waters are especially indicated for degenerative rheumatism such as lumbar or <b>cervical</b> arthritis, <b>osteoarthritis,</b> sciatica, acute lumbago, recurrent arthritis of the hands, knee osteoarthritis, and for inflammatory rheumatism and spontylarthrite rheumatism. The use of sources is also beneficial for the algodystrophy, tendonitis, and phlebological problems (chronic venous insufficiency, suites and sequelae of thrombosis, lymphatic insufficiency, Raynaud's disease), on the other hand, these waters are contraindicated for the varicose ulcer, stroke or recent cardiac events. The cure techniques are the use of showers, individual enclosure (Berthollet), physiotherapy, mud application, underwater showers, and rehabilitation in a swimming pool. By their calming of the nervous system, the waters can cause euphoric relaxation.|$|R
40|$|Summary Objective: Anatomy and {{disorders}} like <b>osteoarthritis,</b> <b>cervical</b> vertebral stenosis and {{intervertebral disc}} degeneration of the equine cervical vertebral column analyzed with Computed Tomography (CT) has received little attention in literature. The {{aim of this}} study is to get a better understanding of the equine cervical vertebral column, comparing radiography and CT as different imaging techniques. Methods: Nineteen radiographic studies and twenty-six CT scans were analyzed for the presence of osteoarthritis. In CT, osteoarthritis was defined by sclerosis, subchondral osteolysis and osteophyte formation. Moreover, intravertebral sagittal ratio and intervertebral disc space was measured in both imaging modalities, of which the results were compared. In sub analysis of intervertebral disc space, the impact of neck position, measuring side and age were compared. Results: The quantity of osteoarthritis was higher in CT (94, 8...|$|R
40|$|In an 8 -week {{double-blind}} study involving 50 patients with <b>cervical</b> or lumbar <b>osteoarthritis,</b> tolmetin and naproxen were compared for efficacy and tolerability {{in the treatment}} of the symptoms of the disease. Study drugs were administered on a b. i. d. schedule: 800 mg of tolmetin or 500 mg of naproxen. Passive pain, pain on pressure and functional parameters (flexion, extension and rotation) were evaluated at baseline and at weeks 2, 4 and 8. Results showed that patients in both groups were significantly improved in all parameters and that tolmetin was significantly superior to naproxen in both pain parameters. The superiority of tolmetin over naproxen in functional parameters was not statistically significant. Tolmetin acted rapidly; at 2 weeks 75 % of the tolmetin patients, as compared with only 42 % of the naproxen patients, reported efficacy greater than that of their previous therapy. Two patients in the naproxen group discontinued because of gastrointestinal symptoms. While both study drugs were effective, tolmetin appeared to be superior to naproxen in pain relief; the drugs were equivalent in influencing motility parameters.

40|$|Background: Joint {{symptoms}} (eg, arthralgia and arthritis) are {{a well-known}} side-effect of aromatase inhibitors. Low oestrogen concentrations and postmenopausal status {{are associated with}} the development of these symptoms. Chemotherapy can also induce joint symptoms, but tamoxifen seems to have little effect on their incidence. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the relative importance of different risk factors for treatment-emergent joint symptoms in patients assigned to anastrozole or tamoxifen as adjuvant treatment for postmenopausal breast cancer. Methods: The Arimidex Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trial randomly assigned 9366 postmenopausal women to anastrozole (1 mg/day), to tamoxifen (20 mg/day), or to a combination of both. Our analyses were based on data from case reports of 5433 women who were randomly assigned to anastrozole or tamoxifen, who started with their allocated treatment, and who did not have joint symptoms at entry (anastrozole group: n= 2698; tamoxifen group: n= 2735). The analysis was restricted to the occurrence of joint symptoms at any time during active treatment or within 14 days of its discontinuation. Joint symptoms were defined as any report of arthralgia, arthrosis, arthritis, or joint disorder on a case-report form. Joint disorders were defined as reports of <b>cervical</b> spondylosis, <b>osteoarthritis,</b> and disc herniation. The date of occurrence was recorded, along with a severity score (ie, mild, moderate, or severe). Our analyses were done by use of logistic regression. The ATAC trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN 18233230. Findings: 777 of 1914 women (40 · 6 %) who used hormone replacement therapy (HRT) before trial entry developed joint symptoms compared with 1001 of 3519 women (28 · 4 %) without previous HRT use (odds ratio [OR] 1 · 72 [95 % CI 1 · 53 - 1 · 93]). Women with hormone-receptor-negative breast cancer developed significantly fewer joint symptoms compared with those with hormone-receptor-positive tumours (124 of 461 [26 · 9 %] vs 1556 of 4548 [34 · 2 %]; OR 0 · 71 [0 · 57 - 0 · 88]). Women for whom chemotherapy was part of their initial treatment developed significantly more joint symptoms than those who did not receive it (461 of 1219 women [37 · 8 %] vs 1317 of 4214 women [31 · 3 %]; OR 1 · 34 [1 · 17 - 1 · 53]). Obese women (body-mass index [BMI]> 30 kg/m²) reported more joint symptoms than women with a BMI of 25 - 30 kg/m² or those with a BMI < 25 kg/m² (504 of 1354 women [37 · 2 %] vs 502 of 1926 women [31 · 3 %; OR 1 · 01 (0 · 88 - 1 · 16) ] vs 592 of 1908 women [31 · 0 %; OR 1 · 32 (1 · 14 - 1 · 53) ]) and women on anastrozole reported more joint symptoms compared with those on tamoxifen (949 of 2698 women [35 · 2 %] vs 829 of 2735 women [30 · 3 %]; OR 1 · 25 [1 · 11 - 1 · 40]). All significant risk factors from the univariate analysis were included in a multivariate analysis and remained significant with little change. Interpretation: In this trial, the major risk factors for developing joint symptoms were previous HRT, hormone-receptor positivity, previous chemotherapy, obesity, and treatment with anastrozole. Discussion of identified risk factors is appropriate when counselling women before initiation of adjuvant hormonal treatment.
