50|$|The Dentist Convention: The hotel {{business}} gains {{a minimum}} from room rent, {{the bulk of}} its profit coming from {{the food and the}} conventions held. A major convention of dentists was supposed to be held in the St. Gregory. Dr Ingram, the president of the convention has arrived and settled in his room. Then a Dr. Nicholas, a prominent dentist, university lecturer, and Negro, arrives at the counter, showing a <b>confirmed</b> <b>reservation.</b> However hotel policy does not allow Negroes. Dr Ingram was quite disappointed at this and threatened to take the convention out of the hotel, causing a major loss. When Peter discussed it with Warren he said, that after a few discussions this would be forgotten and the convention would be held and {{there was no need to}} worry. And after a few meetings the convention finally decided to stay though Mr. Ingram resigned from his post.|$|E

Scheduling large and complex workflows becomes a challenging issue in cloud computing with a requirement that the execution time as well as cost incurred by using a set of heterogeneous cloud resources should be minimizes simultaneously. In this paper, we have extended our previously proposed Bi-Criteria Priority based Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) algorithm to schedule workflow tasks over the available cloud resources under given the deadline and budget constraints while considering the <b>confirmed</b> <b>reservation</b> of the resources. The extended heuristic is simulated and comparison is done with state-of-art algorithms. The simulation results show that extended BPSO algorithm also decreases the execution cost of schedule as compared to state-of-art algorithms under the same deadline and budget constraint while considering the exiting load of the resources too...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the situation in which a passenger holding a valid airline ticket and a <b>confirmed</b> <b>reservation</b> is nevertheless refused carriage. The categories of travellers which are examined are "bumpees" i. e. victims of the airlines' overbooking practices; the handicapped, with special emphasis placed on the situation of pregnant women; the elderly and children; smokers and drunks; racial minorities; and those passengers whose characteristics fit the so-called hijacker profile. Of these, the handicapped, including expectant mothers, emerged as the passengers most often subjected to detrimental discrimination; the treatment of unaccompanied children was also unnecessarily restrictive, whilst overbooking and security screening were recognised to be necessary evils for modern aviation. The analysis concludes with a survey of the recourses available to passengers who have been denied boarding together with some suggestions aimed at ovecoming the problems which underlie the airlines' reasons for refusing carriage...|$|E

40|$|Since the "product" of {{an airline}} cannot be stored, {{the value of}} every seat which is left empty upon {{departure}} is lost forever or "spoiled". In order {{to compensate for the}} economic effects of passengers holding a <b>confirmed</b> <b>reservation</b> who fail to show-up, airlines overbook, i. e. accept more reservations than physical seats are available under the assumption that sufficient no-shows will occur. Even though airlines have overbooked their flights intentionally for decades, very few efforts have been made to measure the economic success of overbooking. As revenue maximization becomes more critical to the profitability of an airline, it is even more important to review the balanced tradeoff between denied boardings and spoilage. This thesis outlines the major philosophies of the currently applied overbooking models and illustrates further the common overbooking performance measurement approaches. As all of these models demonstrate significant shortcomings, a new model, the Revenue Achievement Model, is introduced. This new approach is based on a purely economics driven philosophy. Along with the Revenue Achievement Model, the different definitions of spoilage, oversales and other key values for the overbooking performance evaluation are reviewed and defined anew in an attempt to standardize the terminology. It is shown that the Revenue Achievement Model is more consistent with today's overbooking models than other overbooking performance measurement models. It matches the economic objectives of the airlines and shows superior qualities in comparing flights on a single flight level as well as evaluating the aggregate performance for large samples. The proposed methodology enables also to obtain a target performance index which allows a quantification of the objectives of overbooking. Finally, the impact of system overrides by revenue management analysts is analyzed and methods are suggested to evaluate their actions.

40|$|M {{hotel rooms}} are {{available}} at a date n periods from now. Reservations are made by customers for that date, {{which is at the}} peak of the high season. Typically, for such a time period, a policy of overbooking is exercised by the hotel management. Customers, however, may cancel their previously <b>confirmed</b> <b>reservations</b> at any time prior to their arrival, with no penalty. On the other hand, new requests for rooms for that particular date are generated anew. At the end of each period the hotel management reviews both the "inventory" level of remaining uncanceled (previously <b>confirmed)</b> <b>reservations</b> and the total number of not-yet-confirmed new requests. At that time a decision is made regarding the inventory level of <b>confirmed</b> <b>reservations</b> with which to start the next period. A decision is one of three actions: (i) to keep the inventory at its present level (i. e., declining all new requests); (ii) to increase the level of overbooking by confirming some of the new requests and, if necessary, by trying to obtain some additional reservations (at some extra cost); (iii) to decrease the level of inventory by canceling some of the previously <b>confirmed</b> <b>reservations</b> (incurring a penalty for each such cancellation). Each occupied room at the target day carries a given profit, while each unhonored reservation at that time incurs a penalty. The problem is to find the optimal over-booking strategy that will maximize net profit. For both criteria, maximization of the expected total net profit, and maximization of the expected discounted net profit, it is shown that the optimal strategy is a 3 -region policy as follows: For each period there exist upper and lower bounds and an intermediate point such that, (a) if the overbooking level at the end of a period is greater than the upper bound, it should be decreased to that bound; (b) if the inventory level is below the lower bound, two cases may occur: (i) if the discrepancy is greater than the number of new requests, all new requests should be <b>confirmed</b> and additional <b>reservations</b> should be acquired such that the inventory level will be equal to the lower bound; and (ii) if the discrepancy is smaller than the number of new requests, some of the new requests are confirmed but the inventory level may not exceed the intermediate point; (c) if the inventory level is between the two bounds there are two possibilities: (i) if it is above the intermediate point none of the new requests are confirmed, but (ii) if it is below that point, some of the new requests should be confirmed provided that the new inventory level will not exceed the intermediate point. ...|$|R

But too often this analysis has moved too quickly to tactical details, failing to frame the entire service in human terms. In particular, on-line services that "computerize communication" can be improved by constructing an activity model of what the person is trying to do, not just selling piece-meal services. For example, from the customer's perspective the task of an on-line travel service is not merely to establish <b>confirmed</b> <b>reservations,</b> but to have a complete travel plan, usually integrating many days of transportation, lodging, and recreation into a happy experience.

The year following the 1989 riot, the City became greatly engaged and spent millions of dollars to prepare for Greekfest. This preparation included blocking off the entire beach area with police checkpoints, allowing only those with city-issued passes access to the oceanfront, those passes granted exclusively to residents who lived or worked within the oceanfront perimeter and tourists with <b>confirmed</b> <b>reservations</b> at beachfront hotels. Students and party-goers felt that the event had become overly militarized and within two years the festival was virtually abandoned. Students and community leaders claimed the newly organized structure of the event destroyed the raucous and freewheeling nature of the gathering. The prevailing sentiment was the City of Va. Beach did not welcome the GreekFest crowd and that such treatment was uncalled for and disrespectful. Most attendees felt the racial overtones revealed by such treatment should no longer be tolerated and not only did African American students refuse to return on future Labor Day weekends, but for two decades the city has had trouble courting large numbers of African American tourists of any kind.|$|R
