50|$|The SHELL model {{adopts a}} systems {{perspective}} that suggests the human is rarely, if ever, the sole <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident.</b> The systems perspective considers {{a variety of}} contextual and task-related factors that interact with the human operator within the aviation system to affect operator performance.

5000|$|Modern {{accident}} investigators {{avoid the}} words [...] "pilot error", as {{the scope of}} their work {{is to determine the}} <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident,</b> rather than apportion blame.

[...] ICAO and its member states therefore adopted the Reason Model in 1993 in an effort to better understanding the role of human factors in aviation accidents.|$|E

Unexpected turnoffs usually also disable the engine, power steering, and power brakes, and may be the direct <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident.</b> If a violent collision occurs, the disabled airbags will not deploy to protect vehicle occupants. In 2014, General Motors admitted to concealing information about fatal accidents caused by defective ignition switches which would abruptly shut down a car (including its airbags).

This human action or inaction is called the 'Immediate Cause'. This is the substandard act or human error. Often, when (non-Tripod) investigations determine that the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident</b> was due to human error, in Tripod-terms this would relate to the immediate cause only.|$|E

50|$|The Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) {{identifies}} the human <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident</b> and provides <b>a</b> tool {{to assist in}} the investigation process and target training and prevention efforts. It was developed by Dr Scott Shappell and Dr Doug Wiegmann, Civil Aviation Medical Institute and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA, respectively, in response to a trend that showed some form of human error was a primary causal factor in 80% of all flight accidents in the Navy and Marine Corps.|$|R
50|$|<b>Accident</b> {{classification}} is <b>a</b> standardized {{method by}} which the <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident,</b> including the root causes, are grouped into categories. Accident classification is mainly used in aviation but can be expanded into other areas, such as railroad or health care. While accident reports are very detailed, the goal of accident classification {{is to look at}} a broader picture. By analysing <b>a</b> multitude <b>of</b> <b>accidents</b> and applying the same standardized classification scheme, patterns in how accidents develop can be detected and correlations can be built. The advantage <b>of</b> <b>a</b> standardized <b>accident</b> classification is that statistical methods can be used to gain more insight into accident causation.|$|R
5000|$|In 1966 Johannes Steinhoff {{took over}} {{command of the}} Luftwaffe and {{grounded}} the entire Luftwaffe and Bundesmarine F-104 fleet until he was satisfied that problems had been resolved or at least reduced. In later years, the German safety record improved, although a new problem of structural failure of the wings emerged. Original fatigue calculations had not taken into account {{the high number of}} g-force loading cycles that the German F-104 fleet was experiencing, and many airframes were returned to the depot for wing replacement or outright retirement. Towards the end of Luftwaffe service, some aircraft were modified to carry a flight data recorder or [...] "black box" [...] which could give an indication of the probable <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident.</b> Erich Hartmann, the world's top-scoring fighter ace, commanded one of Germany's first (post-war) jet fighter-equipped squadrons and deemed the F-104 to be an unsafe aircraft with poor handling characteristics for aerial combat. In Navy service it lacked the safety margin of a twin engine design like the Blackburn Buccaneer. To the dismay of his superiors, Hartmann judged the fighter unfit for Luftwaffe use even before its introduction.|$|E
5000|$|... "Let me {{give you}} another example. Years ago our {{assessment}} of corporate culture focused primarily on whether management actively discouraged their operators -- in aviation, that would be pilots -- from following the established company and government rules and procedures. Yet, considering how much we have learned about corporate culture, {{it is difficult to}} accept the fact that accidents occurred because some companies actually encouraged rule breaking. For example, on May 30, 1979, a DeHavilland Twin Otter, operated by Downeast Airlines, a regularly scheduled commuter flight from Boston, crashed near Rockland, Maine, while the pilot was attempting to land in restricted visual conditions. Both pilots and all but one of the 16 passengers were killed in the accident.The investigation found that the visibility was so poor that the pilot could not have been able to see the airport at the point, known as the decision height, at which he was required to abandon the approach if he could not see the airport. Why then did he attempt to land anyway, given the known hazards and prohibitions against such attempts? Well, further investigation found a corporate culture in place at that airline that not only did not enhance safety but actively discouraged it. The owner of the airline, who as president directed its day to day operations, conveyed to the captain and to all pilots his expectations that they would cut corners in the interest of saving money. In fact, he criticized and threatened them when they did not.In addition, we learned that the captain believed that he had no real authority to stand up to the company president and, moreover, feared for his job if he did not satisfy the president's wishes. Although this accident was certainly not the first one in which an abusive or threatening management style adversely affected flight safety, it was the first we could recall in which the Safety Board explicitly addressed the role of management in the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident.</b> The lessons of this accident were unmistakable: a management climate that pressures pilots to ignore flight rules and safe operating practices, and threatens pilots if they do not conform to these practices, adversely affects the safety of the operation." ...|$|E

5000|$|The system {{safety concept}} {{calls for a}} risk {{management}} strategy based on identification, analysis of hazards and application of remedial controls using a systems-based approach. [...] This is different from traditional safety strategies which rely on control <b>of</b> conditions and <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident</b> based either on the Epidemiological analysis or as <b>a</b> result <b>of</b> investigation of individual past accidents. The concept of system safety is useful in demonstrating adequacy of technologies when difficulties are faced with probabilistic risk analysis. The underlying principle is one <b>of</b> synergy: <b>a</b> whole is more than sum of its parts. Systems-based approach to safety requires the application of scientific, technical and managerial skills to hazard identification, hazard analysis, and elimination, control, or management of hazards throughout the life-cycle <b>of</b> <b>a</b> system, program, project or an activity or a product.

40|$|The {{problem of}} finding out the exact <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> road {{accidents}} {{is one of the}} most controversial problems being under discussion in the field of road safety. There are no satisfactory definitions of the basic notions relevant to the <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> accidents and the accident itself and it is why investigation of the mechanism <b>of</b> <b>a</b> road <b>accident</b> and its causes is faced with difficulties. This results in an imperfect statistical classification of road accidents, and classification is the basis of research into any quantitative phenomena and <b>a</b> component <b>of</b> the statistical method. The question to be answered is which definition <b>of</b> the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> road <b>accident</b> should be accepted as a tool for selecting the causes for statistical purposes. After <b>a</b> rough analysis <b>of</b> practical application of numerous conceptions of causation used in various fields founded on the theory of casual nexus it can be noted that „the theory of equivalent causes" applied by criminal law may also serve to work out methods of preventing accidents. On the grounds of the assumptions of that theory and <b>an</b> analysis <b>of</b> the views up to now of the adaptation of the theory for preventive purposes it seems useful to assume that „equivalent conditions" existing before <b>an</b> <b>accident,</b> which could be eliminated or whose influence could be limited, are the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> the accident. If in the statistics of road <b>accidents</b> several <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>accident</b> are given according to the suggested criterion, the field of observation is much larger and the accuracy <b>of</b> selecting <b>causes</b> is increased and consequently the statistical observation for basic research purposes is of greater value.
