It encodes 37 genes: 13 for subunits of respiratory complexes I, III, IV and V, 22 for mitochondrial tRNA (for the 20 standard amino acids, plus an extra gene for leucine and serine), and 2 for rRNA.

This chromosome is a <b>circular</b> <b>DNA</b> molecule which contains 5,342,073 nucleotide pairs and 5,043 genes, of which 4,988 encode proteins. The fraction of guanine + cytosine pairs is 65 mole percent. The number of chromosomes in the cells and the DNA content increases upon aging, {{and in the}} stationary growth phase, cultures may contain more than 100 copies of a chromosome per cell. The original DNA content (one copy) is restored when replanting the culture into a fresh medium. In addition to chromosomal DNA, Azotobacter can contain plasmids.|$|E
5|$|The first {{complete}} DNA {{sequence of}} an E. coli genome (laboratory strain K-12 derivative MG1655) {{was published in}} 1997. It {{was found to be}} a <b>circular</b> <b>DNA</b> molecule 4.6 million base pairs in length, containing 4288 annotated protein-coding genes (organized into 2584 operons), seven ribosomal RNA (rRNA) operons, and 86 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes. Despite having been the subject of intensive genetic analysis for about 40 years, a large number of these genes were previously unknown. The coding density was found to be very high, with a mean distance between genes of only 118 base pairs. The genome was observed to contain a significant number of transposable genetic elements, repeat elements, cryptic prophages, and bacteriophage remnants.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we {{assemble}} a few ingredients that are remotely connected to each other, but {{governed by the}} rule of coding theory ([1], [12]) and formal language theory, i. e. cyclic codes and DNA codes. Our interest arose from the remark that there exist both linear and <b>circular</b> <b>DNAs</b> in higher living organisms. We state the theory of codes in a wide sense due to [1] {{in order to understand}} the <b>circular</b> <b>DNAs</b> while we state rudiments of formal language theory as a means to interpret genes. We hope this will be a starter for unifying two approaches depending on the theory of codes and that of formal language...|$|R
40|$|Measurements on un{{strained}} linear and weakly strained large (≥ 340 bp) <b>circular</b> <b>DNAs</b> yield torsional rigidities in {{the range}} C = 170 – 230 fJ fm. However, larger values, {{in the range}} C = 270 – 420 fJ fm, are typically obtained from measurements on sufficiently small (≤ 247 bp) <b>circular</b> <b>DNAs,</b> and values in the range C = 300 – 450 fJ fm are obtained from experiments on linear DNAs under tension. A new method is proposed to estimate torsional rigidities of weakly supercoiled <b>circular</b> <b>DNAs.</b> Monte Carlo simulations of the supercoiling free energies of solution DNAs, and also of the structures of surface-confined supercoiled plasmids, were performed using different trial values of C. The results are compared with experimental measurements of the twist energy parameter, ET, that governs the supercoiling free energy, and also with atomic force microscopy images of surface-confined plasmids. The results clearly demonstrate that C-values in the range 170 – 230 fJ fm are compatible with experimental observations, whereas values in the range C ≥ 269 fJ fm, are incompatible with those same measurements. These results strongly suggest that the secondary structure of DNA is altered by either sufficient coherent bending strain or sufficient tension so as to enhance its torsional rigidity...|$|R
5|$|The genome of HBV {{is made of}} <b>circular</b> <b>DNA,</b> but it {{is unusual}} because the DNA is not fully double-stranded. One end of the full length strand {{is linked to the}} viral DNA polymerase. The genome is 3020–3320 {{nucleotides}} long (for the full-length strand) and 1700–2800 nucleotides long (for the short length-strand). The negative-sense (non-coding) is complementary to the viral mRNA. The viral DNA is found in the nucleus soon after infection of the cell. The partially double-stranded DNA is rendered fully double-stranded by completion of the (+) sense strand and removal of a protein molecule from the (−) sense strand and a short sequence of RNA from the (+) sense strand. Non-coding bases are removed from the ends of the (−) sense strand and the ends are rejoined. There are four known genes encoded by the genome, called C, X, P, and S. The core protein is coded for by gene C (HBcAg), and its start codon is preceded by an upstream in-frame AUG start codon from which the pre-core protein is produced. HBeAg is produced by proteolytic processing of the pre-core protein. In some rare strains of the virus known as Hepatitis B virus precore mutants, no HBeAg is present.|$|E

40|$|The R 1 {{restriction}} endonuclease from bacteria containing the RTF- 1 plasmid cleaves polyoma virus DNA {{at a single}} site. Virus stocks which have been passaged through cells several times at moderate or high multiplicities contain closed <b>circular</b> <b>DNAs</b> which are not cleaved by the R 1 endonuclease. One such population of DNAs, is not infectious, and when sheared and denatured, reassociates at a rate approximately four times faster than polyoma DNA. The predominant DNA in the population is 10 % smaller than polyoma DNA and contains {{a fraction of the}} polyoma genome tandemly repeated three to four times. There is no significant contamination of the covalently closed <b>circular</b> <b>DNAs</b> by repetitive host sequences.

40|$|<b>Circular</b> double {{stranded}} <b>DNA</b> {{has different}} topological states which {{are defined by}} their linking numbers. Equilibrium distribution of linking numbers {{can be obtained by}} closing a linear DNA into a circle by ligase. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we predict the temperature dependence of the linking number distribution of small <b>circular</b> <b>DNAs.</b> Our predictions are based on flexible defect excitations resulted from local melting or unstacking of DNA base pairs. We found that the reduced bending rigidity alone can lead to measurable changes of the variance of linking number distribution of short <b>circular</b> <b>DNAs.</b> If the defect is accompanied by local unwinding, the effect becomes much more prominent. The predictions can be easily investigated in experiments, providing a new method to study the micromechanics of sharply bent DNAs and the thermal stability of specific DNA sequences. Furthermore, the predictions are directly applicable to the studies of binding of DNA distorting proteins that can locally reduce DNA rigidity, form DNA kinks, or introduce local unwinding.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that genomic {{materials}} (long DNA chains) of living organisms are often packed compactly under extreme confining conditions using macromolecular self-assembly processes but the general DNA packing mechanism remains an unsolved problem. It has been proposed that the topology of the packed DNA may be used to study the DNA packing mechanism. For example, in the case of (mutant) bacteriophage P 4, DNA molecules packed inside the bacteriophage head are considered to be circular since the two sticky ends of the DNA are close to each other. The DNAs extracted from the capsid without separating the two ends can thus preserve the topology of the (<b>circular)</b> <b>DNAs.</b> It turns out that the <b>circular</b> <b>DNAs</b> extracted from bacteriophage P 4 are non-trivially knotted with very high probability and with a bias toward chiral knots. In order to study this problem using a systematic approach based on mathematical modeling, one needs to introduce a DNA packing model under extreme volume confinement condition and test whether such a model can produce the kind of knot spectrum observed in the experiments. In this paper we introduce and study a model of equilateral random polygons con_ned in a sphere. This model is not meant to generate polygons that model DNA packed in a virus head directly. Instead, the average topological characteristics of this model may serve as benchmark data for totally randomly packed <b>circular</b> <b>DNAs.</b> The difference between the biologically observed topological characteristics and our benchmark data might reveal the bias of DNA packed in the viral capsids and possibly lead {{to a better understanding of}} the DNA packing mechanism, at least for the bacteriophage DNA. The purpose of this paper is to provide information about the knot spectrum of equilateral random polygons under such a spherical confinement with length and confinement ratios in a range comparable to <b>circular</b> <b>DNAs</b> packed inside bacteriophage heads...|$|R

On average, the genomes are 2.9 to 3.0 millions of base pairs (commonly abbreviated Mb). It has a GC-content between 46.2 and 46.6% and is predicted to encode about 2800 to 3100 proteins. The difference in the genomes of these strains lies in variant cell envelopes, secretory proteins, and polysaccharides.

25|$|The {{mechanism}} for chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) replication {{has not been}} conclusively determined, but two main models have been proposed. Scientists have attempted to observe chloroplast replication via electron microscopy since the 1970s. The results of the microscopy experiments led {{to the idea that}} chloroplast DNA replicates using a double displacement loop (D-loop). As the D-loop moves through the <b>circular</b> <b>DNA,</b> it adopts a theta intermediary form, also known as a Cairns replication intermediate, and completes replication with a rolling circle mechanism. Transcription starts at specific points of origin. Multiple replication forks open up, allowing replication machinery to transcribe the DNA. As replication continues, the forks grow and eventually converge. The new cpDNA structures separate, creating daughter cpDNA chromosomes.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two primary}} types of cells. Prokaryotes lack a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, {{although}} they have <b>circular</b> <b>DNA</b> and ribosomes. Bacteria and Archaea are two domains of prokaryotes. The other primary type of cells are the eukaryotes, which have distinct nuclei bound by a nuclear membrane and membrane-bound organelles, including mitochondria, chloroplasts, lysosomes, rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and vacuoles. In addition, they possess organized chromosomes that store genetic material. All species of large complex organisms are eukaryotes, including animals, plants and fungi, though most species of eukaryote are protist microorganisms. The conventional model is that eukaryotes evolved from prokaryotes, with the main organelles of the eukaryotes forming through endosymbiosis between bacteria and the progenitor eukaryotic cell.|$|E

40|$|The {{migration}} {{properties of}} a series of supercoiled plasmids ranging in size from 4 to 16 kilobases (kb) have been analyzed by orthogonal-field-alternation gel electrophoresis (OFAGE). These <b>circular</b> <b>DNAs</b> enter the gel and are well resolved. Unlike linear DNA molecules, the relative mobilities of these plasmids are constant over a wide range of pulse times, from 10 to 120 seconds, as well as over a broad range of total running times, from 6 to 24 hours. Electrophoresis of supercoiled, relaxed, and nicked open circular forms as well as topoisomers of pBR 322 shows that the extent of supercoiling has a dramatic effect on plasmid migration on OFAGE. Several practical applications for exploiting the different migration properties of <b>circular</b> and linear <b>DNA</b> molecules on OFAGE are presented...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a new plant}} single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) virus, a nanovirus isolate originating from the faba bean in Ethiopia. We applied rolling circle amplification (RCA) to extensively copy the individual <b>circular</b> <b>DNAs</b> of the nanovirus genome. By sequence analyses of more than 208 individually cloned genome components, we obtained {{a representative sample of}} eight polymorphic swarms of <b>circular</b> <b>DNAs,</b> each about 1 kb in size. From these heterogeneous DNA populations after RCA, we inferred consensus sequences of the eight DNA components of the virus genome. Based on the distinctive molecular and biological properties of the virus, we propose to consider it a new species of the genus Nanovirus and to name it faba bean necrotic stunt virus (FBNSV). Selecting a representative clone of each of the eight DNAs for transfer by T-DNA plasmids of Agrobacterium tumefaciens into Vicia faba plants, we elicited the development of the typical FBNSV disease symptoms. Moreover, we showed that the virus thus produced was readily transmitted by two different aphid vector species, Aphis craccivora and Acyrthosiphon pisum. This represents the first reconstitution of a fully infectious and sustainably insect-transmissible nanovirus from its cloned DNAs and provides compelling evidence that the genome of a legume-infecting nanovirus is typically comprised of eight distinct DNA components...|$|R
25|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated {{transformation}} is another common technique. Agrobacteria are natural plant parasites, and their natural ability to transfer genes provides another engineering method. To create a suitable environment for themselves, these Agrobacteria insert their genes into plant hosts, {{resulting in a}} proliferation of modified plant cells near the soil level (crown gall). The genetic information for tumor growth is encoded on a mobile, <b>circular</b> <b>DNA</b> fragment (plasmid). When Agrobacterium infects a plant, it transfers this T-DNA to a random site in the plant genome. When used in genetic engineering the bacterial T-DNA {{is removed from the}} bacterial plasmid and replaced with the desired foreign gene. The bacterium is a vector, enabling transportation of foreign genes into plants. This method works especially well for dicotyledonous plants like potatoes, tomatoes, and tobacco. Agrobacteria infection is less successful in crops like wheat and maize.|$|E
25|$|As {{previously}} mentioned, linear chromosomes face {{another issue}} that is not seen in <b>circular</b> <b>DNA</b> replication. Due {{to the fact that}} an RNA primer is required for initiation of DNA synthesis, the lagging strand is at a disadvantage in replicating the entire chromosome. While the leading strand can use a single RNA primer to extend the 5' terminus of the replicating DNA strand, multiple RNA primers are responsible for lagging strand synthesis, creating Okazaki fragments. This leads to an issue {{due to the fact that}} DNA polymerase is only able to add to the 3' end of the DNA strand. The 3'-5' action of DNA polymerase along the parent strand leaves a short single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) region at the 3' end of the parent strand when the Okazaki fragments have been repaired. Since replication occurs in opposite directions at opposite ends of parent chromosomes, each strand is a lagging strand at one end. Over time this would result in progressive shortening of both daughter chromosomes. This is known as the end replication problem.|$|E
25|$|One of {{competing}} model for cpDNA replication asserts that most cpDNA is linear and participates in homologous recombination and replication structures similar to bacteriophage T4. It {{has been established}} that some plants have linear cpDNA, such as maize, and that more species still contain complex structures that scientists do not yet understand. When the original experiments on cpDNA were performed, scientists did notice linear structures; however, they attributed these linear forms to broken circles. If the branched and complex structures seen in cpDNA experiments are real and not artifacts of concatenated <b>circular</b> <b>DNA</b> or broken circles, then a D-loop mechanism of replication is insufficient to explain how those structures would replicate. At the same time, homologous recombination does not expand the multiple A --> G gradients seen in plastomes. Because of the failure to explain the deamination gradient {{as well as the}} numerous plant species that have been shown to have circular cpDNA, the predominant theory continues to hold that most cpDNA is circular and most likely replicates via a D loop mechanism.|$|E
