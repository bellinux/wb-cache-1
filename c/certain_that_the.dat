5|$|Although American {{officials}} {{at the highest levels}} of the intelligence community (e.g. CIA Director William Colby) were <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> South Vietnamese government would collapse, everyone in the U.S. government underestimated the speed of the North Vietnamese advance during the 1975 Spring Offensive and how quickly South Vietnam's Army would collapse.|$|E
5|$|Falco {{is losing}} money and clients. Given {{one last chance}} by the bullying, intimidating Hunsecker, he schemes to plant a false rumor in a rival column that Dallas is a dope-smoking Communist, then {{encourages}} Hunsecker to rescue Dallas's reputation, <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> headstrong boyfriend will reject Hunsecker's favor and end up looking bad to Susan.|$|E
5|$|I am {{not quite}} <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> present {{regulations}} governing {{the arrangement of}} matches give entire satisfaction, {{and it would be}} worth considering whether they could not be arranged so that each team would play once at home and once at the place where their opponents hail from.|$|E

5|$|The Fugue in G minor, BWV 131a is a {{transcription}} for {{organ of}} the fugue from the closing movement of the cantata. Although the work has an BWV number, it is not <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> arranger was Bach.|$|E
5|$|Bearing a large bony frill {{and three}} horns on its large four-legged body, and {{possessing}} similarities {{with the modern}} rhinoceros, Triceratops {{is one of the}} most recognizable of all dinosaurs and the best known ceratopsid. It shared the landscape with and was probably preyed upon by Tyrannosaurus, though it is less <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two did battle in the manner often depicted in traditional museum displays and popular images.|$|E
5|$|Complicating the picture, Reagan {{suffered}} {{an episode of}} head trauma in July 1989, five years before his diagnosis. After being thrown from a horse in Mexico, a subdural hematoma was found and surgically treated later in the year. Nancy Reagan, citing what doctors told her, asserted that her husband's 1989 fall hastened the onset of Alzheimer's disease, although acute brain injury has not been conclusively proven to accelerate Alzheimer's or dementia. Reagan's one-time physician Daniel Ruge has said it is possible, but not <b>certain,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> horse accident affected the course of Reagan's memory.|$|E

5|$|Controlled {{experiments}} with colonies of Cerapachys biroi suggest {{that an individual}} may choose nest roles based on her previous experience. An entire generation of identical workers was {{divided into two groups}} whose outcome in food foraging was controlled. One group was continually rewarded with prey, while it was made <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> other failed. As a result, members of the successful group intensified their foraging attempts while the unsuccessful group ventured out fewer and fewer times. A month later, the successful foragers continued in their role while the others had moved to specialise in brood care.|$|E
5|$|In December 2015, Liam Lotter found a grey {{piece of}} debris {{on a beach}} in {{southern}} Mozambique, but only after he read in March 2016 about Gibson's find (some 300 kilometres from his find) did his family alert authorities. It was flown to Australia for analysis. It carried a stencilled code 676EB, which identified it as part of a Boeing 777 flap track fairing, and the style in which the lettering was painted onto the fairing matched stencils used by Malaysia Airlines, making it almost <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> part came from 9M-MRO.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} {{to the arrival of}} the Crusaders, the regent of Damascus, Mu'in ad-Din Unur, started making feverish preparations for war, strengthening the fortifications of Damascus, ordering troops to his city and having the water sources along the road to Damascus destroyed or diverted. Anur sought help from the Zangid rulers of Aleppo and Mosul (who were normally his rivals), though forces from these states did not arrive in time to see combat outside of Damascus. It is almost <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Zangid rulers delayed sending troops to Damascus out of the hope that their rival Anur might lose his city to the Crusaders.|$|E
50|$|It is {{questioned}} whether Wycliffe himself translated the whole Bible. In any case, it is <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> at <b>the</b> fifteenth century {{portions of the}} Scriptures were called Wycliffite.|$|R

5|$|It is not <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{slaves were}} a {{homogeneous}} group {{under the leadership}} of Spartacus. While this is the unspoken assumption of the Roman historians, this may be the Romans projecting their own hierarchical view of military power and responsibility on the ad hoc organization of the slaves. Certainly other slave leaders are mentioned—Crixus, Oenomaus, Gannicus, and Castus—and it cannot be told from the historical evidence whether they were aides, subordinates, or even equals leading groups of their own and traveling in convoy with Spartacus' people.|$|E
5|$|It was now common {{knowledge}} that Edward was dying, and foreign diplomats suspected that some scheme to debar Mary was under way. France found {{the prospect of the}} emperor's cousin on the English throne disagreeable and engaged in secret talks with Northumberland, indicating support. The diplomats were <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> overwhelming majority of the English people backed Mary, but nevertheless believed that Queen Jane would be successfully established.|$|E
5|$|McGovern–Hatfield {{was put up}} for a vote {{again in}} 1971, with {{somewhat}} weaker provisions designed to gain more support. In polls, a large majority of the public now favored its intent, and McGovern took his name off a final form of it, as some senators were just objecting to him. Nevertheless, in June 1971, it failed to pass again, gaining only a few more votes than the year before. McGovern was now <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> only way the war would come to a quick end was if there was a new president.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of November29, 1729, the Natchez came to Chépart with corn, poultry, and deerskins, also {{carrying}} with them a calumet—well known as a peace symbol. The commandant, still somewhat intoxicated from drinking the night before, was <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Natchez had no violent intentions, and he challenged those who had warned of an attack {{to prove that the}} rumors were accurate.|$|E
5|$|Only {{very late}} {{on the night of}} 15 June was Wellington <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Charleroi attack was the main French thrust. In the early hours of 16 June, at the Duchess of Richmond's ball in Brussels, he {{received}} a dispatch from the Prince of Orange and was shocked by the speed of Napoleon's advance. He hastily ordered his army to concentrate on Quatre Bras, where the Prince of Orange, with the brigade of Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar, was holding a tenuous position against the soldiers of Ney's left wing.|$|E
5|$|Support for {{establishing}} a republic {{instead of a}} monarchy was around 18 per cent in the United Kingdom in 2006, while a majority thinks that {{there will still be}} a monarchy in the United Kingdom in ten years' time, public opinion is rather uncertain about a monarchy still existing in fifty years and a clear majority believes that the monarchy will no longer exist a century after the poll. Public opinion is, however, <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> monarchy will still exist in thirty years. About 30 per cent are in favour of discontinuing the monarchy after Elizabeth's death.|$|E

5|$|The FBI {{eliminated}} Weber as {{an active}} suspect in July 1998 when his fingerprints did not match any of those processed in the hijacked plane, and no other direct evidence could be found to implicate him. Later, his DNA also failed to match the samples recovered from Cooper's tie, though the bureau has since conceded that they cannot be <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> organic material on the tie came from Cooper.|$|E
5|$|The only {{surviving}} {{record of}} the trial is the speech given by Theomnestus and Apollodorus against Neaira and Stephanus, and the outcome is unknown. No records of Neaira exist after the trial. Modern commentators have noted the weaknesses in Apollodorus' arguments, though as the outcome of an Athenian trial depended heavily on what the parties involved could persuade the jury to accept, {{and how much of}} their dishonesty they could get away with, we cannot say for <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> suit failed.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Æthelburg's {{marriage}} being dependent on Edwin {{allowing her to}} practice her faith has been questioned, since revising the chronology makes it likely, though not <b>certain,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> marriage was arranged before Eadbald's conversion. In this view, {{it would have been}} the church that objected to the marriage, and Æthelburg would have been Christian before Eadbald's conversion. The story of Paulinus's consecration is also problematic as he was not consecrated until at least 625 and possibly later, which is after the latest possible date for Æthelburg's marriage. However, it may be that he traveled to Northumbria prior to his consecration and only later became bishop.|$|E
