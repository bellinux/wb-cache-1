40|$|SUMMARY. The {{isolated}} rat heart perfused with washed platelets {{was used}} as a model to examine platelet-vessel wall interactions. Release of prostacyclin and thromboxane A 2 was measured, using a cascade of smooth muscle bioassay tissues or radioimmunoassays of the stable hydration products. In hearts perfused with rabbit or human platelets, injection of sodium arachidonate caused release of both prostacyclin and thromboxane A 2. In hearts perfused with aspirin-pretreated platelets, arachidonate released only prostacyclin indicating that thromboxane A 2 originates largely in the platelets. Infusion of epinephrine (0. 6 - 6 nmol/liter) through the heart potentiated arachi-donate-induced release of thromboxane A 2. Similar potentiation of thromboxane A 2 release was observed in rat hearts perfused with either rabbit or human platelets, and in rabbit hearts perfused with rabbit platelets. In contrast, when rabbit platelets were infused through an incubation <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> <b>tubing</b> in place of the heart, epinephrine did not alter thromboxane A 2 release. There was no significant loss of rabbit platelets on perfusion through rat hearts, and no aggregates were observed in the effluent either before or immediately after arachidonate injections, even in the presence of epinephrine. Thus, potentiation of thromboxane A 2 production could not be explained by aggregation. However, it is clear from these studies that physiological concentrations o...|$|E

40|$|Coiled tubing {{drilling}} {{has become}} an important development direction of drilling. The method of combining theoretical calculation with the experimental verification is adopted to analyze the flow <b>of</b> the <b>coiled</b> <b>tubing</b> drilling system. A set of experimental bench is developed, three kinds of curvature ratio <b>of</b> <b>coiled</b> <b>tubing</b> are used, and the frictional pressure losses <b>of</b> <b>coiled</b> <b>tubing</b> and partial pressure drop of each downhole tool are tested. The results of experiments with water agree well with rough pipe calculation model. The pressure losses <b>of</b> <b>coiled</b> tube are obviously larger than that of straight tube, {{and the value of}} it is about 11 – 17 %. The larger the curvature ratio is, the more the pressure losses <b>of</b> <b>coiled</b> <b>tubing</b> are. The fluid experiment with the polymer presents obviously the drag reduction effect. Experiment of simulated bottom hole assembly shows that partial pressure drop of bottom hole assembly is large.

30|$|Many {{data output}} in radiopharmacy is {{commonly}} based on detection of radioactivity, {{which is usually}} measured with an in-line detector in liquid chromatography. In-line detection is described in general monographs in the Ph. Eur. 2.2. 66 (European Pharmacopeia 9.0 2017 a). Briefly, a sample containing a radiopharmaceutical is diluted (if necessary) and injected onto a chromatography system with specified volume, conditions and column as written in accordant standard operating procedure (SOP). Important QC parameters for in-line detection on LC are limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ) and detector linearity (Guide for the elaboration of monographs on radiopharmaceutical preparations 2018). Numerous more parameters influence the activity quantification such as the detector’s crystal dimensions, inner diameter and length <b>of</b> <b>tubing</b> (flow cell) used, position <b>of</b> <b>tubing</b> with respect to crystal (in front of or through crystal) and distance <b>of</b> <b>tubing</b> with respect to crystal.

40|$|Analytical {{buckling}} {{models are}} important for down-hole operations to ensure the structural integrity of the drill string. A literature survey shows that most published analytical buckling models do not address the effects of inclination angle, boundary conditions or friction. The objective {{of this paper is}} to study the effects of boundary conditions, friction and angular inclination on the helical buckling <b>of</b> <b>coiled</b> <b>tubing</b> in an inclined wellbore. In this paper, a new theoretical model is established to describe the buckling behavior <b>of</b> <b>coiled</b> <b>tubing.</b> The buckling equations are derived by applying the principles of virtual work and minimum potential energy. The proper solution for the post-buckling configuration is determined based on geometric and natural boundary conditions. The effects of angular inclination and boundary conditions on the helical buckling <b>of</b> <b>coiled</b> <b>tubing</b> are considered. Many significant conclusions are obtained from this study. When the dimensionless length <b>of</b> the <b>coiled</b> <b>tubing</b> is greater than 40, the effects of the boundary conditions can be ignored. The critical load required for helical buckling increases as the angle of inclination and the friction coefficient increase. The post-buckling behavior <b>of</b> <b>coiled</b> <b>tubing</b> in different configurations and for different axial loads is determined using the proposed analytical method. Practical examples are provided that illustrate the influence of the angular inclination on the axial force. The rate of change of the axial force decreases with increasing angular inclination. Moreover, the total axial friction also decreases with an increasing inclination angle. These results will help researchers to better understand helical buckling in coiled tubing. Using this knowledge, measures can be taken to prevent buckling in coiled tubing during down-hole operations...|$|R

50|$|Flat-plate collectors, {{developed}} by Hottel and Whillier in the 1950s, {{are the most}} common type. They consist of (1) a dark flat-plate absorber, (2) a transparent cover that reduces heat losses, (3) a heat-transport fluid (air, antifreeze or water) to remove heat from the absorber, and (4) a heat insulating backing.

50|$|A {{loop antenna}} is a closed circuit radio antenna, {{consisting}} of a loop or <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> wire, <b>tubing,</b> or other electrical conductor ideally fed by a balanced source or feeding a balanced load. Within this physical description there are two distinct antenna types: The large resonant loop antenna with a circumference close to one wavelength and the small loop which when used only for receive on low frequencies can {{be as little as}} 1% of a wavelength in circumference, but when used for transmission is typically about 5 to 30% of a wavelength in circumference. Most loop antennas are resonated to the operating frequency. The full wavelength loop is self resonant, small transmitting loops use a series capacitor to achieve resonance and the small receiving loop uses multiple turns and a parallel capacitor which resonates with the net inductance of the loop itself.|$|R

A burner may have a secondary propane valve that releases propane more slowly and thereby generates a different sound. This is called a whisper burner and is used for flight over livestock to lessen the chance of spooking them. It also generates a more yellow flame and is used for night glows because it lights up the inside of the envelope better than the primary valve.|$|R

This work involved the development of radar navigation and radio data transmission systems for integration with microhole coiled tubing bottom hole assemblies. Under this contract, Stolar designed, fabricated, and laboratory and field tested two advanced technologies of importance to the future growth of the U. S. oil and gas industry: (1) real-time measurement-while-drilling (MWD) for guidance and navigation <b>of</b> <b>coiled</b> <b>tubing</b> drilling in hydrocarbon reservoirs and (2) two-way inductive radio data transmission on coiled tubing for real-time, subsurface-to-surface data transmission.

30|$|A {{common and}} costly {{problem in the}} oil and gas {{industry}} is that of corrosion and scale/wax formation. These two phenomena can inhibit the production system and bring about the obstruction of oil path during production, transportation, and refining (Bennetzen and Mogensen 2014). Scale formation occurs on the surface of the production line, around the wellbore, and in the porous formation enclosing the oil. Traditional methods such as squeeze treatments are often performed to curtail scale formation but are costly due to chemical cost and production loss arising from shut-in periods. Common techniques to solve this include scrapping and hot oil operation with the aid <b>of</b> <b>coiled</b> <b>tubing</b> unit (CTU) but this increase the non-productive time.|$|R
50|$|In {{more serious}} cases, pumping from surface is {{insufficient}} {{as it does}} not target any particular location downhole and reduces the chances of the chemical retaining its effectiveness when it gets there. In these cases, {{it is necessary to}} spot the chemical directly at its target through the use <b>of</b> <b>coiled</b> <b>tubing.</b> Coiled tubing is run in hole with a jetting tool on the end. When the tool is at its target, the chemical is pumping through the pipe and is jetted directly onto the damaged area. This can be more effective than pumping from surface, though it is much more expensive, and accuracy is dependent on knowing the location of the damage.|$|R
50|$|Pumping through {{coiled tubing}} {{can also be}} used for {{dispersing}} fluids to a specific location in the well such as for cementing perforations or performing chemical washes of downhole components such as sandscreens. In the former case, coiled tubing is particularly advantageous compared to simply pumping the cement from surface as allowing it to flow through the entire completion could potentially damage important components, such as the downhole safety valve. Coiled tubing umbilical technologies enable the deployment of complex pumps which require multiple fluid strings on coiled tubing. In many cases, the use <b>of</b> <b>coiled</b> <b>tubing</b> to deploy a complex pump can greatly reduce the cost of deployment by eliminating the number of units on site during the deploy.|$|R
50|$|These {{tasks are}} by default the realm <b>of</b> wireline. Because <b>coiled</b> <b>tubing</b> is rigid, {{it can be}} pushed into the well from the surface.

For highly deviated and horizontal wells, gravity may be insufficient for wireline logging. Roller stem and tractors can often overcome this disadvantage at greatly reduced cost, particularly on small platforms and subsea wells where coiled tubing would require mobilizing an expensive mobile drilling rig. The use <b>of</b> <b>coiled</b> <b>tubing</b> for these tasks is usually confined to occasions where it is already on site for another purpose, for example a logging run following a chemical wash.|$|R
