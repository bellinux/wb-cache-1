We performed a comparative study of the structure and nature of these <b>conversion</b> <b>layers</b> as observed during reconnection at Earth`s magnetopause and in the geomagnetic tail.

In order to study the mechanism of {{formation of}} the pre-treatment, the open circuit potential was measured during the layer formation. The effect of the microstructure was investigated {{at different stages of}} the deposition by means of SEM–EDS and scanning Kelvin probe force microscope (SKPFM). The electrochemical behaviour of the pre-treated alloys was characterized by means of open circuit potential measurements and potentiodynamic polarization in aggressive solutions containing chlorides. The deposition of the Zr and Ti containing oxide is an electrochemically driven process. The existence of cathodic sites on the alloy surface is the driving force for the formation of the <b>conversion</b> <b>layer.</b> During the initial stages of dipping in the conversion bath the naturally formed oxide film is removed or thinned due to the presence of fluorides in the bath.
