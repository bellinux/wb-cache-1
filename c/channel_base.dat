The audio processor is then responsible for dynamically rendering sound output depending on the number and position of speakers available. Dolby Atmos uses a similar technique, although the speaker layout employed by cinema DTS:X {{is the sum of}} Dolby Atmos and Auro-3D. The layout showcased at AMC Burbank theatre number 8 has a standard eight <b>channel</b> <b>base</b> layer, a five channel height layer on top of the base layer (on the front and side walls) and three rows of speakers on the ceiling.

The characteristics of the field wave shapes are shown to be very sensitive to the <b>channel</b> <b>base</b> current, especially the field zero crossing at 100 km for the TCS and DU models, and the magnetic hump after the initial peak at close range for the TCS models. Also, the DU model is theoretically extended to include any arbitrarily varying return stroke speed with height. A brief discussion is presented on the effects of an exponentially decreasing speed with height on the calculated fields for the TCS, MTL, and DU models...|$|E
40|$|Communicated by the {{associate}} editor name) Abstract. In wireless networks, guard <b>channel</b> <b>based</b> Call Admission Control (CAC) schemes {{are widely used}} to protect handoff calls for seamless wireless services. However, the introduction of guard channels in wireless networks results in {{the increase in the}} new call blocking probability. This general sit-uation also occurs in a 3 G-WLAN integrated network. To solve this problem in a 3 G-WLAN integrated network for QoS support, we propose an adaptive guard <b>channel</b> <b>based</b> CAC scheme in this paper. The main objective of our guard <b>channel</b> <b>based</b> CAC scheme is to alleviate the increase in the new call blocking probability due to guard channels while it can still protect handoff calls. For the design of our adaptive guard <b>channel</b> <b>based</b> CAC scheme, we first develop and analyze a performance model for a general guard <b>channel</b> <b>based</b> CAC scheme based on a level-dependent quasi birth and death model. The analytic results are used to design our adaptive guard <b>channel</b> <b>based</b> CAC scheme. Numerical studies show that our adaptive guard <b>channel</b> <b>based</b> CA...|$|R

In this paper, we propose an approach of emotion recognition using EEG signals based on the weighted fusion of multiple base classifiers. These base classifiers based on SVM are constructed using a channel division mechanism according to the neuropsychological theory that different brain areas are differ in processing intensity of emotional information. The outputs of <b>channel</b> <b>base</b> classifiers are integrated by a weighted fusion strategy {{which is based on}} the confidence estimation on each emotional label by each base classifier. The evaluation on the DEAP dataset shows that our proposed multiple classifiers fusion method outperforms individual <b>channel</b> <b>base</b> classifiers and the feature fusion method for EEG-based emotion recognition...|$|E
40|$|Effects of the {{impedance}} {{of lightning}} earthing path on lightning currents are investigated by computer simulation. Distributed-circuitry transmission line models with adequate values of inductance, resistance and capacitance are chosen to represent lightning channels, upward connecting leaders, structures and lightning protection systems (LPS). Both the current and voltage {{as a function of}} time and height of the lightning channel are simulated. Results show that for a lightning stroke without an upward connecting leader, the large lightning stroke current is firstly generated at the <b>channel</b> <b>base</b> and then propagates upward as its amplitude decreases. For the case with an upward leader, however, the return stroke current appears firstly at the connecting point of the upward- and downward- leaders, and then propagates bidirectionally down and up as its amplitude decreases. The existence of an upward leader makes both the lightning current and the rate of change of the current at the <b>channel</b> <b>base</b> smaller than with no an upward leader. For a LPS with larger resistance and inductance, the lightning current through it would be smaller but the larger voltage across the LPS would increase the risk offlashover. LPS with large capacitance, however, can make the lightning currents at the <b>channel</b> <b>base</b> smaller without increasing the risk offlashover. The results suggest that a LPS with higher resistance or inductance cannot limit the lightning current effectively, but a LPS with larger capacitance such as the Faraday cage can.

40|$|Among {{all natural}} hazards, floods pose the greater threat to property, safety and {{economic}} {{well being of}} human communities the world over. This study focused on understanding the nature of flooding {{in areas that are}} outside of streams. Normally, flooding has been dealing with bursting of river banks but in Tsholotsho flooding has occurred in areas that are located far away from defined drainage networks. The study established the nature of problems associated with flooding as a preamble to flood hazard modelling. Logistic regression was applied in a spatial database that had been developed and managed within a GIS to estimate the prediction power of the environmental variables (height above <b>channel</b> <b>base,</b> slope of drainage basin, distance from the nearest stream and soil type) for flood occurrence. The results indicate that height above <b>channel</b> <b>base</b> significantly (p < 0. 05) predicted flood hazard for Hambeni and Sheleni while distance away from the nearest channel was significant (p < 0. 05) in predicting flood hazard for Ntibu. The flood hazard map represents flood occurrence for each pixel. The developed flood hazard map will be useful in mitigating the loss of property from future flood disasters in Hambeni, Ntibu and Sheleni.,WATERne...|$|E
40|$|Air to {{air heat}} {{exchangers}} {{play a crucial}} role in mechanical ventilation equipment, due to the potential primary energy savings both in case of refurbishment of existing buildings or in case of new ones. In particular, interest in heat wheels is increasing due to their low pressure drop and high effectiveness. In this paper a detailed optimization of design parameters of heat wheels is performed in order to maximize sensible effectiveness and to minimize pressure drop. The analysis is carried out through a one dimensional lumped parameters heat wheel model, which solves heat and mass transfer equations, and through appropriate correlations to estimate pressure drop. Simulation results have been compared with experimental data of a heat wheel tested in specific facilities, and good agreement is attained. The device optimization is performed through the variation of main design parameters, such as heat wheel length, <b>channel</b> <b>base,</b> height and thickness and for different operating conditions, namely the air face velocity and the revolution speed. It is shown that the best configurations are achieved with small channel thickness and, depending on the required sensible effectiveness, with appropriate values of wheel length and <b>channel</b> <b>base</b> and height...|$|E

Initially, coarse alluvium was generally absent in the new channel, allowing for rapid stream incision to occur - up to 20  m in a decade near {{the centre of the}} landslide. This rapid incision promoted extensive instability from both banks, and reintroduced coarse alluvium (cobbles and boulders) from the pre-slide channel into the new channel (Fig. 3). This coarse material however, had a short residence time in the channel and was quickly mobilized downstream, leaving the <b>channel</b> <b>base</b> unprotected.|$|E
