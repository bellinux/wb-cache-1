5|$|Aware of {{the time}} constraints, Otway decided he <b>could</b> <b>wait</b> no longer, and the reduced {{battalion}} headed for the battery and joined up with Major Smith's reconnaissance party just outside the village of Gonneville en Auge. The reconnaissance party had cut a way through the barbed wire, and marked four routes through the minefield. Otway divided his men into four assault groups, and settled down to await {{the arrival of the}} three gliders.|$|E
5|$|In a 2011 study, {{researchers}} {{tested to}} see if people would willingly choose between instant and delayed gratification by offering them a set amount of (hypothetical) money that they could receive presently, or telling them they <b>could</b> <b>wait</b> a month for more money. Results suggested that willingness to delay gratification depended {{on the amount of}} money being offered, but also showed wide individual variation in the threshold of later reward that was motivating enough to forgo the immediate reward. The subjective value of a reward can also stem from the way one describes the potential reward. As prospect theory states, people are heavily loss-averse. People tend to value a commodity more when it is considered to be something that can be lost or given up than when it is evaluated as a potential gain.|$|E
5|$|In 1794, a basin {{was built}} above Framilode lock, so that vessels <b>could</b> <b>wait</b> {{there until the}} tide in the Severn was at a {{suitable}} level. This had been requested by the Thames and Severn Canal company, but requests for a horse towing path in 1799 and 1812 were dismissed as too expensive. They eventually provided one after the Gloucester and Berkeley Canal had been built, and the canal was {{the only part of}} the waterway from Shrewsbury on the Severn to Teddington on the Thames that did not have one. It was completed in August 1827. The opening of the Gloucester and Berkeley Canal in 1825 required a slight diversion where they crossed at Saul, and the levels were adjusted by building a new lock on the Stroudwater below the junction, to ensure neither company lost water to the other. The new company paid for its construction.> After the Gloucester and Berkeley Canal opened to Sharpness in 1827, the link between Saul and the Severn at Framilode was used much less, although coal from the Forest of Dean still used that route.|$|E

25|$|The militiamen could {{pursue the}} raiders {{immediate}}ly, {{to keep them}} from escaping, or they <b>could</b> <b>wait</b> for Logan to arrive with reinforcements. Daniel Boone advised waiting for Logan, who was only a day away, but others urged immediate action, pointing out that the enemy force had a 40-mile (60km) lead on them. Boone felt compelled to go along. The Kentuckians set out on horseback over an old buffalo trail before making camp at sunset.|$|E
25|$|NSB started {{large-scale}} unmanning of its stations {{from the}} 1970s, following {{the introduction of}} centralized traffic control. This led to a paradigm shift in the way new station were designed. There {{was no longer a}} need for a station building. Instead focus was on larger platforms to handle many travelers, better access and large roofed areas where passengers <b>could</b> <b>wait.</b> Holmlia was the first major project of this kind in Norway and represented a trend where suburbs with high ridership received stations with high throughput. Arne Henriksen at NSB Arkitektkontor was selected as the head architect, and Holmlia became his breakthrough. He would continue to dominate railway architecture in Norway the next two decades. Holmlia Station won him Houens Fonds Diplom in 1988.|$|E

25|$|During the 1870s, European {{initiatives}} {{against the}} Arab slave trade caused {{an economic crisis}} in northern Sudan, precipitating increasing unrest. Relations between Egypt and Abyssinia (later renamed Ethiopia) had become strained due to a dispute over the district of Bogos, and war broke out in 1875. An Egyptian expedition was completely defeated near Gundet. A second and larger expedition under Prince Hassan was sent the following year and was routed at Gura. Matters then remained quiet until March 1877, when Gordon proceeded to Massawa, hoping {{to make peace with}} the Abyssinians. He went up to Bogos and wrote to the king proposing terms. He received no reply as the king had gone southwards to fight with the Shoa. Gordon, seeing that the Abyssinian difficulty <b>could</b> <b>wait,</b> proceeded to Khartoum.|$|E
25|$|A {{basic income}} (or {{negative}} income tax) {{is a system}} of social security that periodically provides each citizen with a sum of money that is sufficient to live on frugally. It is argued that recipients of the basic income would have considerably more bargaining power when negotiating a wage with an employer as {{there would be no}} risk of destitution for not taking the employment. As a result, the jobseeker could spend more time looking for a more appropriate or satisfying job, or they <b>could</b> <b>wait</b> until a higher-paying job appeared. Alternatively, they could spend more time increasing their skills in university, which would make them more suitable for higher-paying jobs, as well as provide numerous other benefits. Experiments on Basic Income and NIT in Canada and the USA show that people spent more time studying while the program was running.|$|E
25|$|Sala do Corpo Diplom√°tico (Diplomatic Corp's Room), {{was used}} for visiting ambassadors {{and members of the}} {{diplomatic}} corp, who waited in this room before being presented in the throne room. This room is full of classical motifs, presenting a ceiling with animals, figures and chariots, based on a Greek frieze, with painted walls and inlaid parquet floor. Three of the walls have tapestries with royal coats of arms and the last with a fireplace surmounted by mirror, with chairs assembled for the gathered visitors, all accented in red velvet and gold, and two large ornamental vases. Alongside is a small antechamber used so that visitors <b>could</b> <b>wait</b> as their name was presented to the monarchs, before appearing in the throne room. On the walls of this room are portraits of John VI of Portugal and Carlota Joaquina on opposite walls.|$|E

25|$|During {{the third}} day Arima {{sent a message to}} Pessoa saying that he wished to renew {{negotiations}} about the silk prices, and was willing to send hostages aboard to prove his sincerity, provided that the carrack stayed where it was. Pessoa, in return, demanded the sons of both Arima Harunobu and Murayama Toan, and that he be allowed to take the ship to the neighbouring anchorage of Fukuda, where he <b>could</b> <b>wait</b> for favourable winds to go back to Macau. Arima gave no reply, but Hasegawa was furious when he heard about the exchange, telling Pessoa in a message that Arima had no authority to make such a proposal, and on the contrary had direct orders to kill Pessoa. Hasegawa added that if Pessoa surrendered himself and let the cargo be sold at a price decided by the Japanese, he could intercede on Pessoa's behalf. Pessoa politely declined further negotiations as long as the Japanese continued hostilities.|$|E
25|$|Even more importantly, the Third Anglo-Dutch War {{temporarily}} interrupted VOC {{trade with}} Europe. This caused {{a spike in}} the price of pepper, which enticed the English East India Company (EIC) to enter this market aggressively in the years after 1672. Previously, one of the tenets of the VOC pricing policy was to slightly over-supply the pepper market, so as to depress prices below the level where interlopers were encouraged to enter the market (instead of striving for short-term profit maximisation). The wisdom of such a policy was illustrated when a fierce price war with the EIC ensued, as that company flooded the market with new supplies from India. In this struggle for market share, the VOC (which had much larger financial resources) <b>could</b> <b>wait</b> out the EIC. Indeed, by 1683, the latter came close to bankruptcy; its share price plummeted from 600 to 250; and its president Josiah Child was temporarily forced from office.|$|E
25|$|With the Sportimes {{finishing}} with WTT's worst record in 2013, the Aviators had the top pick in each round of both WTT drafts. With the first overall selection in the marquee player draft, the Aviators chose Bob and Mike Bryan {{whom they had}} protected as a doubles team. Thus, the identical twins simultaneously became the first players who could call themselves San Diego Aviators. With the first pick {{in the second round}} of the marquee player draft (ninth overall), the Aviators selected Daniela Hantuchov√° who committed to playing in WTT full-time for the 2014 season. The Aviators protected Kvƒõta Peschke, making her the only holdover player from the 2013 Sportimes on the 2014 Aviators' roster. With the first pick in the first round of the roster player draft, the Aviators selected Somdev Devvarman. They used their second round choice for Raven Klaasen. With Hantuchov√° committed to playing full-time, the Aviators knew they did not need all four of their picks in the roster draft. They also knew they <b>could</b> <b>wait</b> until the fourth round to take Peschke whom they had protected. So, the Aviators traded their third round pick to the Springfield Lasers in exchange for the Lasers' fourth round pick and cash consideration. The Aviators used their fourth round pick (22nd overall) to draft Peschke and passed on the fourth round pick (27th overall) that they acquired in the trade with the Lasers, since their roster was full.|$|E

500|$|Further to Laing's {{reading of}} the song's message, author and critic Tim Riley deems the {{barriers}} in communication to be the boundaries imposed by the anxious, Western concept of time, as Harrison instead [...] "seeks healthy exchange and the enlightened possibilities" [...] offered outside such limitations. According to Riley, [...] "the transcendental key" [...] is therefore the song's concluding lines ‚Äì [...] "I don't mind / I <b>could</b> <b>wait</b> forever, I've got time" [...] ‚Äì signifying the singer's release from vexation and temporal restrictions.|$|E
500|$|On 12 December 1975 Private Eye {{included}} another short teasing {{piece by}} Auberon Waugh which ended: [...] "My only {{hope is that}} sorrow over his friend's dog will not cause Mr Thorpe's premature retirement from public life". By this time most newspapers knew of the stories surrounding Thorpe and Scott, but were wary of libel; according to Parris, by keeping silent they were [...] "serving notice on Thorpe that they knew a bigger story must break, and <b>could</b> <b>wait</b> for it". In January 1976 Scott appeared before magistrates on a minor social security fraud charge, and stated {{that he was being}} hounded because of his previous sexual relationship with Thorpe. This claim, made in court and therefore protected from the libel laws, was widely reported.|$|E
500|$|In September1909 {{newspapers}} carried {{reports that}} Cook and Peary had each reached the North Pole, Cook in April1908 and Peary a year later. Asked to comment, Amundsen avoided an outright endorsement of either explorer, but surmised that [...] "probably something {{will be left}} to be done". While he avoided {{the controversy over the}} rival claims, [...] he saw immediately that his own plans would be seriously affected. Without the allure of capturing the pole, he would struggle to maintain public interest or funding. [...] "If the expedition was to be saved... there was nothing left for me but to try and solve the last great problem‚Äîthe South Pole". Thus Amundsen decided to go south; the Arctic drift <b>could</b> <b>wait</b> [...] "for a year or two" [...] until the South Pole had been conquered.|$|E
