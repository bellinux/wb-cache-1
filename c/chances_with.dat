5|$|In February 1854, the General Assembly's Whig {{majority}} gerrymandered the Eighth District, removing {{over 500}} Democratic voters and {{replacing them with}} several hundred Whig voters by removing Owen and Jessamine counties from the district and adding Harrison and Nicholas counties to it. The cooperation of the Know Nothing Party—a relatively new nativist political entity—with the faltering Whigs further hindered Breckinridge's re-election <b>chances.</b> <b>With</b> his family again in financial straits, his wife wanted him to retire from national politics.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of a}} new Waldorf-Astoria {{hotel was}} based on the concept {{that there should be a}} large opulent hotel in New York for {{distinguished}} visitors. Financial backing was not difficult to get in the summer of 1929 as times were prosperous; the stock market had not yet crashed nor had the Depression arrived. However, before ground was broken for the new building, some of the investors became dubious about whether this was the right time to be investing in a luxury hotel. The land for the new hotel was formerly owned by the New York Central Railroad, who had promised $10 million toward the building of the new Waldorf-Astoria. The railroad and all the other investors decided to honor their commitments and take their <b>chances</b> <b>with</b> the uncertain financial climate.|$|E
5|$|Two {{candidates}} {{stood with}} rather less support. William Ralls Morrison of Illinois {{had served in}} Congress since 1873 and was best known for advocating tariff reductions despite hailing from a protectionist district. He commanded little support outside his home state, and was seen as only a favorite son. Justice Stephen Johnson Field of the United States Supreme Court was better known, but still an unlikely victor. The only candidate from the Far West, Field was respected as a scholar of the law, but had greatly diminished his <b>chances</b> <b>with</b> {{his home state of}} California by striking down anti-Chinese legislation in that state in 1879. Even so, some observers, including Edwards Pierrepont, considered Field a likely choice for the nomination.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the start}} of the match, a minute's silence was held, in memory of Rafa Benítez's father Francesco who died of heart failure on the Wednesday before the final. Both teams took the pitch wearing black armbands as a mark of respect. The match was delayed further when a fan invaded the pitch, he headed for one of the goals and got stuck in the goal before being caught. São Paulo lined up in a 3–5–2 formation, while Liverpool opted for a 4–4–1–1 formation. Liverpool had the first chance of the match inside the opening 79 seconds. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard's cross into the penalty area was met by Fernando Morientes, but the striker headed wide of the goal. Liverpool created more <b>chances</b> <b>with</b> Luis García missing the goal twice from headers. São Paulo had only created one chance, a shot from striker Amoroso, but they began to grow in confidence. They pressed forward after Amoroso's shot and defender Cicinho nearly scored with a lob from the halfway line which just went over the crossbar.|$|E

25|$|The Australian {{team had}} the great opening {{partnership}} Bobby Simpson and Bill Lawry who {{were supported by}} Peter Burge, Brian Booth, Neil Harvey, Ken Mackay, Norm O'Neill and Barry Shepherd. The left-handed all-rounder Alan Davidson was the best bowler, taking 24 wickets (20.00) in the series and wrecking England <b>chances</b> <b>with</b> his 5/25 in the Third Test. He {{was supported by the}} 21-year-old fast bowler Garth McKenzie, who took 20 wickets (30.95), but no other Australian bowler averaged under 40.|$|E

25|$|After the 1939 races, LeVier got {{his first}} formal job, working as a {{mechanic}} for the Douglas Aircraft Company, hoping to get promoted to test pilot. However, frustrated by his <b>chances</b> <b>with</b> that company, he earned an instrument rating {{and went to work}} for Mid-Continent Airlines in Kansas City. Six months later, though, he left that job also, to work with General Motors testing engines for Cessna aircraft in Wichita. When a job opened for him at the Lockheed Corporation in Burbank, California, he left Wichita and returned to southern California.|$|E
25|$|After the {{conclusion}} of World War I in November 1918, Nungesser tried to organize a private flying school but failed to attract enough students.

It was when Nungesser was in the U.S. doing the film The Dawn Patrol that he became interested in the idea of making a transatlantic flight and told his friends his next trip to America would be by air.|$|E
25|$|Australian-born Stuart Law stood tall at the crease, {{defying the}} Somerset bowlers to make 59 before being run {{out on the}} very last ball, but Somerset only needed 115 from 16 overs - a run rate of 7.19. Smith and Trescothick started positively, before Trescothick's England team-mate Andrew Flintoff had him edge behind to Warren Hegg for 10. With two more wickets falling, Lancashire would perhaps have fancied their <b>chances</b> <b>with</b> the Somerset score on 65 for 3, but Smith defied them with an unbeaten 64, adding 53 in a fourth-wicket stand with young James Hildreth to guide Somerset to the target with seven wickets and eleven balls to spare.|$|E

25|$|He {{soon found}} that such work {{did not pay}} enough to keep his retinue, and so he sought {{employment}} from the French foreign office, either as a writer or a diplomat.

One of this official's functions was to subsidize political pamphleteers, and Mirabeau hoped to be so employed.

25|$|Mannock was {{conscious}} his poor educational and lower-class background {{would put him}} at a considerable disadvantage in the well-educated and higher-class surroundings of the RE. Mannock's solution to his problem was to throw himself into his work. The method was practical but his insular behaviour was construed as odd. Mannock despised his peers who were disinterested in the war and seemed concerned only with the uniforms, quality tailoring and how it would improve their <b>chances</b> <b>with</b> women. Tired of the banal conversations and lethargy of his comrades, Mannock looked to leave the RE but realised a second resignation would damage his chances of becoming a commissioned officer.|$|E
25|$|In early July it {{appeared}} that he had jinxed both their <b>chances</b> <b>with</b> Heath behind in the polls in the General Election and Kent {{at the bottom of}} the championship table. The change came when Sussex defeated them in the Gillette Cup, giving them two rest days which Cowdrey used to hammer out their difficulties in a team meeting. They decided to chase bonus points and won 7 and drew 5 of their last 12 games, often by close margins and it was a draw at the Oval, where Cowdrey made 112, that gave them the title with the newly elected Prime Minister Heath at the ground to invite them to a reception at Number 10 to celebrate.|$|E

25|$|On 5 November Southampton {{travelled}} to face West Bromwich Albion able to {{move out}} of the relegation zone with a win thanks to the draw between Reading and Queens Park Rangers the day before. The game started with both sides relatively evenly matched, but it was the home side who broke the deadlock nine minutes before the break courtesy of Peter Odemwingie. After half time it was the Saints who had the early <b>chances,</b> <b>with</b> Lambert hitting the crossbar as soon as the game resumed, but more defensive problems led to a second goal for the hosts, again from Odemwingie. West Brom continued to enjoy chances throughout the rest of the game, but it ended 2–0 to leave Southampton bottom of the league.|$|E

Afterward, Mega Man's ally Proto Man comes in and warns the hero {{that it is a}} trap, stating that the seemingly ill scientist is an impostor used by Wily to make the initial news video. Mega Man then takes his <b>chances</b> <b>with</b> Wily, and while he is disabled when Wily's fortress comes down on him, Proto Man returns quickly to save him. In the end, Dr. Wily escapes, Dr. Light is freed, and the status quo is restored. The eight Robot Masters are rebuilt and given new functions working alongside Light and his other robots.|$|E

25|$|Xavier Marshall with 82 and Daren Ganga with 99 – {{both with}} ODIs for West Indies – lifted West Indies A to 228 for 2, {{but there was}} little {{resistance}} after that, and Sajeewa Weerakoon could take six wickets with his left-arm spin. However, Jermaine Lawson and Tino Best put pressure on with good and lucky fast bowling, as only wicket-keeper Prasanna Jayawardene passed fifty runs. The touring team had a slender lead of 37, but batting with more composure the second time around, Ryan Ramdass and Carlton Baugh, who both made fifties, ensured that the visitors would have to chase 316. They were well on their way – despite two wickets from Best early on, and Avishka Gunawardene retiring hurt – with 126 for 2 at stumps on day 3. And they would have fancied their <b>chances</b> <b>with</b> the hard-hitting Gunawardene at the crease, and the score 255 for 5. Then the wheels fell off – the last five wickets went for three runs, and the West Indians took the first of the three-game series.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{failed to}} score a run and left eight men on base through five innings.	Ethier, pinch hitting, scored Pederson on a single in the sixth inning for the Dodgers' only run. They only had one hit in 13 <b>chances</b> <b>with</b> runners in scoring {{position}} in the game. Kershaw pitched four scoreless innings of relief in the game, and in the process, he broke Orel Hershiser's Dodgers postseason record with his 33rd strikeout. Morton pitched four innings of relief to earn the win, as Corey Seager grounded out to José Altuve, who threw to Yuli Gurriel to end the game, series, baseball season, and their 55-year drought. The Astros became the third consecutive road team to win a World Series Game 7 as well as the fourth consecutive team to end a World Series on the road (after the 2014 Giants, 2015 Royals and 2016 Cubs). They also became just the second team to win a seven game League Championship Series and a seven game World Series in the same year, following the 1985 Kansas City Royals. Springer won the World Series MVP Award.|$|E
25|$|One thing more: at {{the close}} of the Civil War, when the problem of the emancipated slaves was before the nation, it might have left them in a {{condition}} of alienage, or established them as wards of the government, like the Indian tribes, and thus retained for the nation jurisdiction over them, or it might, as it did, give them citizenship. It chose the latter. By the Fourteenth Amendment, it made citizens of all born within the limits of the United States and subject to its jurisdiction. By the Fifteenth, it prohibited any state from denying the right of suffrage on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude, and by the Thirteenth, it forbade slavery or involuntary servitude anywhere within the limits of the land. Whether this was or was not the wiser way to deal with the great problem is not a matter for the courts to consider. It is for us to accept the decision, which declined to constitute them wards of the nation or leave them in a condition of alienage where they would be subject to the jurisdiction of Congress, but gave them citizenship, doubtless believing that thereby, in the long run, their best interests would be subserved, they taking their <b>chances</b> <b>with</b> other citizens in the states where they should make their homes.|$|E
