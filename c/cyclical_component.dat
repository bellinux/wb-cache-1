40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of using different macroeconomic variables and output decompositions to estimate the euro area output gap. We estimate twelve multivariate unobserved components models with phase shifts being allowed between individual <b>cyclical</b> <b>components.</b> As output decomposition plays {{a central role in}} all multivariate models, three different output decompositions are utilised; these are a first-order stochastic cycle combined with either a local linear trend or a damped slope trend, and a second-order cycle plus an appropriate trend specification (a trend following a random walk with a constant drift is generally preferred). We also extend the commonly used trivariate models of output, inflation and unemployment to incorporate a fourth variable, either investment or industrial production. We find that the four-variate model incorporating industrial production produces the most satisfactory output gap estimates, especially when the output gap is modelled as a first-order cycle. In addition, measuring phase shifts and calculating contemporaneous correlations between individual <b>cyclical</b> <b>components</b> provides {{a better understanding of the}} different gap estimates. We conclude that the output gap estimate in all models leads the <b>cyclical</b> <b>components</b> of inflation and unemployment, but lags those of industrial production and investment. Furthermore, the output gap estimates obtained from the four-variate model including investment present the longest leads-and-lags with respect to other <b>cyclical</b> <b>components,</b> implying that investment appears to be more of a leading indicator than a coincident variable for the euro area. output gap, higher-order cycle, industrial production, state-space, Kalman filter. ...|$|R
50|$|Figure 1 {{shows the}} time series of real GNP for the United States from 1954-2005. While we see {{continuous}} growth of output, {{it is not}} a steady increase. There are times of faster growth and times of slower growth. Figure 2 transforms these levels into growth rates of real GNP and extracts a smoother growth trend. A common method to obtain this trend is the Hodrick-Prescott filter. The basic idea is to find a balance between the extent to which general growth trend follows the cyclical movement (since long term growth rate {{is not likely to be}} perfectly constant) and how smooth it is. The HP filter identifies the longer term fluctuations as part of the growth trend while classifying the more jumpy fluctuations as part of the <b>cyclical</b> <b>component.</b>|$|E

Using an unobserved components state-space model (via the Beveridge-Nelson decomposition), I decompose the remittances and output series into stochastic permanent and <b>cyclical</b> <b>components.</b> I then use the resulting stationary <b>cyclical</b> <b>components</b> to estimate co-movements between remittances and output series. Empirical results indicate that remittances are counter-cyclical with all the home countries: Mexico, El Salvador, and Turkey. With respect to source countries, remittances to Mexico are counter-cyclical with the United States business cycle, while remittances from the United States to El Salvador and remittances from Germany to Turkey are strongly pro-cyclical with output fluctuations in the source country. The contribution of this paper to the literature is twofold: (1) I use highfrequency data (quarterly) for a relatively long period of time; and (2) I employ more recent and sophisticated econometric techniques in the decomposition of the series into stochastic permanent and <b>cyclical</b> <b>components.</b> The existing literature lacks both of these important aspects of my analysis.
