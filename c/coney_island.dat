5|$|Rail {{transportation}} to <b>Coney</b> <b>Island</b> had been available since 1864. The Brooklyn, Bath and <b>Coney</b> <b>Island</b> Railroad {{was the first}} steam railroad to <b>Coney</b> <b>Island.</b> It ran from Fifth Avenue and 36th Street {{in what is now}} Sunset Park, to its West End Terminal, at the present-day <b>Coney</b> <b>Island</b> Terminal's location, along what is now the right-of-way of the West End Line. The nearby Culver Depot, along the Atlantic Ocean waterfront near the site of the present-day West Eighth Street station, served the Brooklyn, Flatbush, and <b>Coney</b> <b>Island</b> Railway (now the Brighton Line) and Prospect Park and <b>Coney</b> <b>Island</b> Railroad (now the Culver Line). Other rail transportation included the Manhattan Beach Railroad; the Sea Beach Railroad; the <b>Coney</b> <b>Island</b> and Brooklyn Railroad; and Long Island City via the Long Island Rail Road.|$|E
5|$|Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue (also {{known as}} <b>Coney</b> <b>Island</b> Terminal and signed on some trains as either <b>Coney</b> <b>Island</b> or Stillwell Avenue) is a New York City Subway {{terminal}} in <b>Coney</b> <b>Island,</b> Brooklyn, {{acting as the}} railroad-south terminus for the D, F, N, and Q trains. The large facility, originally built in 1919, was designed {{at a time when}} <b>Coney</b> <b>Island</b> was the primary summer resort area for the New York metropolitan area, with all of the rail lines in southern Brooklyn funneling service to the area. It {{is one of the largest}} elevated transportation terminals in the world.|$|E
5|$|Gone to <b>Coney</b> <b>Island</b> and Booming Business are two 1910 American silent short comedy {{productions}} by the Thanhouser Company. Both {{were released}} {{together on a}} single film reel on July 5, 1910. Gone to <b>Coney</b> <b>Island</b> is a comedy that features <b>Coney</b> <b>Island,</b> which the mere subject would make for a successful film. Booming Business {{may have been the}} very type of slapstick comedy that Edwin Thanhouser specifically said the Thanhouser Company would not produce. The productions of both films have no credits for the cast or crew, but possible candidates for these roles exist. Reviews of the films favored Gone to <b>Coney</b> <b>Island,</b> but some reviewers specifically refused to explain the plot because <b>Coney</b> <b>Island</b> subjects were deemed self-explanatory. Booming Business received one detailed review in The New York Dramatic Mirror which was negative. The films are presumed lost.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} Culver Line {{was opened}} by the Prospect Park and <b>Coney</b> <b>Island</b> Railroad {{and was named}} after the railroad's builder, Andrew N. Culver. The line ran along the surface of McDonald Avenue (then Gravesend Avenue) from Greenwood Cemetery (where it connected with horse car lines including the Vanderbilt Avenue Line, operated by the PP until 1886) to the Culver Depot in <b>Coney</b> <b>Island,</b> on June 25, 1875. The PP began serving the Union Depot at 36th Street, where transfer {{could be made to}} the Fifth Avenue Elevated, on June 7, 1890, by using the Prospect Park and South Brooklyn Railroad from a junction at Parkville. During a period of Long Island Rail Road control, from 1893 to 1899, a ramp at 36th Street was opened in 1895, allowing Brooklyn Elevated Railroad trains to operate over the Culver Line to <b>Coney</b> <b>Island.</b> The Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT), by then the owner of the Brooklyn Elevated, leased the Culver Line (to the Brooklyn Heights Railroad) on June 18, 1899, and began using it to take not only elevated trains but also trolleys to <b>Coney</b> <b>Island.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1910s, a {{completely}} reconstructed New West End Terminal (which gradually became {{better known as}} <b>Coney</b> <b>Island</b> Terminal) was built on an elevated structure. The new terminal unified the terminals {{of most of the}} former steam railroad lines terminating at <b>Coney</b> <b>Island,</b> aside from the Long Island Rail Road-controlled New York and Manhattan Beach Railway. This new terminal could accommodate hundreds of thousands of passengers a day. This project entailed rerouting the Brighton and Culver Lines from a ground-level alignment to an elevated structure with four tracks and eight platforms.|$|E

5|$|At Ditmas Avenue, the Culver Ramp {{ends and}} the {{underground}} line becomes elevated. This is a three-track Dual Contracts elevated on the former BMT line over McDonald (formerly Gravesend) Avenue. Just before the station, the southbound local track merges into the southbound express track, while the northbound express track becomes the El's bidirectional center express track. During the 1990s and 2000s, the center express track in this section was occasionally used for non-revenue testing. After Avenue X station, a ramp diverges to the surface {{for access to the}} Culver Yard of the <b>Coney</b> <b>Island</b> Yards complex. At this point the Culver Line narrows to a two-track structure bearing one more station–Neptune Avenue–before curving into West Eighth Street–New York Aquarium station on <b>Coney</b> <b>Island.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1956, {{residents}} of <b>Coney</b> <b>Island</b> protested against paying a {{transfer to the}} bus on Mermaid Avenue (now the B74 bus to Sea Gate), with some saying that the 15-cent fee for transferring should be abolished because the bus was essentially an adjunct to the station. In 1979, the City Planning Commission proposed something similar, in that <b>Coney</b> <b>Island</b> residents would get a free transfer between the /B74 bus routes and the subway station. It was noted that the station {{was the only one}} that did not get a free bus transfer after the corresponding subway transfer was discontinued (in sharp contrast to the BMT Culver Line, BMT Myrtle Avenue Line, and IRT Third Avenue Line, which were discontinued but replaced by bus transfers). The free transfers would allow a $200 million apartment complex nearby, funded by the government, to get more residents to move in, as well as diversify Mark Twain Junior High School and attract a stable middle class.|$|E
5|$|North of the station, tracks 7 and 6 {{merge into}} one track (with a switch from track 7 to track 8), tracks 5 through 2 merge into another track, and tracks 1 and 8 stay separate, {{so that there}} is a four-tracked {{structure}} when the BMT West End Line and BMT Sea Beach Line cross the <b>Coney</b> <b>Island</b> Creek. Before the structure crosses the creek, all four tracks have switches that connect the tracks to each other, before the West End and Sea Beach Lines split. Tracks from these lines then lead into <b>Coney</b> <b>Island</b> Yard. South of the station, tracks 4, 5, and 6 stay separate from the other tracks (with a pair of switches between tracks 5 and 6) and tracks 1, 2, and 3 merge and have a diamond crossover with track 4. Tracks 3 and 4 (the Brighton Line tracks) are above tracks 5 and 6 (the Culver Line tracks) at this point.|$|E

Cheese may be added as well and variations are found throughout the state, with each city claiming theirs is the best. These diners usually also have gyros served with cucumber or honey mustard sauce, as well as hamburgers, sandwiches, breakfast and dinner entrees. Most <b>Coney</b> <b>Islands</b> are open 24 hours and also a popular place to get a late or early coffee.|$|R

5|$|The Great Blizzard of 1888 helped {{demonstrate}} {{the benefits of}} an underground transportation system. A plan {{for the construction of}} the subway was approved in 1894, and construction began in 1900. The first underground line of the subway opened on October 27, 1904, almost 36 years after the opening of the first elevated line in New York City, which became the IRT Ninth Avenue Line. The fare was $0.05 and on the first day the trains carried over 150,000 passengers. The oldest structure still in use opened in 1885 as part of the BMT Lexington Avenue Line in Brooklyn and is now part of the BMT Jamaica Line. The oldest right-of-way, {{which is part of the}} BMT West End Line near <b>Coney</b> <b>Island</b> Creek, was in use in 1864 as a steam railroad called the Brooklyn, Bath and <b>Coney</b> <b>Island</b> Rail Road.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{transfer}} from the <b>Coney</b> <b>Island</b> Terminal to the Norton's Point Trolley to Sea Gate, via an elevated footbridge across Stillwell Avenue to the elevated trolley station. In 1948, the trolley was discontinued because it duplicated another trolley along a similar route (namely the McDonald Avenue Line). The trolley ramp spanning Stillwell Avenue and West 15th Street was torn down around this time.|$|E
