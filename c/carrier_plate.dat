25|$|The main {{change from}} {{previous}} missions {{is the change}} of the Ground Umbilical <b>Carrier</b> <b>Plate</b> (GUCP) vent housing. The quick release vents exhibited leaks during STS-119 and STS-127, which were determined {{to be due to}} a misalignment in the vent. This led to the one part rigid seal in the external tank being replaced with a two part flexible seal.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{replacement}} of the valves, the Mission Management Team gave the approval for launch, and scheduled it for 11 March 2009. The astronauts arrived at the Kennedy Space Center on 8 March 2009 to prepare for launch. The 11 March 2009 launch was scrubbed due to a leak in a liquid hydrogen vent line between the shuttle and the external tank. On 15 March 2009, the shuttle successfully lifted off from pad 39A. The leak problem manifested itself again during STS-127 which led to a thorough test. The root cause was found to be a misalignment in the GUCP (Ground Umbilical <b>Carrier</b> <b>Plate)</b> which was set right leading to a successful flight.|$|E
25|$|The second launch {{attempt on}} 17 June 2009 was also {{scrubbed}} due to hydrogen leak issues {{seen from the}} Ground Umbilical <b>Carrier</b> <b>Plate.</b> Due to conflicts with {{the launch of the}} LRO, and due to a beta angle constraint, the next available launch opportunity was scheduled for 11 July 2009. A successful tanking test for leak checks was performed on 1 July 2009, with modified GUCP seals allowing launch preparations to proceed as scheduled. Because of lightning strikes near the launch pad during the evening of 10 July 2009, NASA scrubbed the launch for the third time and rescheduled for 12 July 2009. Due to a Return To Launch Site (RTLS) weather violation, NASA scrubbed the launch for the fourth time on the evening of 12 July 2009.|$|E

50|$|The Hydrogen Vent Line Access Arm mated the External Tank (ET) Ground Umbilical <b>Carrier</b> <b>Plate</b> (GUCP) to {{the launch}} pad {{hydrogen}} vent line. The GUCP provided support for plumbing and cables, called umbilicals, that transferred fluids, gases, and electrical signals between two pieces of equipment. While the ET was being fueled, hazardous gas was vented from an internal hydrogen tank through the GUCP, out a vent line to a flare stack where it was burned off at a safe distance. Sensors at the GUCP measured gas level. The GUCP was redesigned after leaks created scrubs of STS-127 and were also detected during attempts to launch STS-119 and STS-133. The GUCP released from the ET at launch and fell away with a curtain of water sprayed across it for protection from flames.|$|E
