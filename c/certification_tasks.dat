40|$|Background: There is {{scientific}} evidence, but limited, {{that physicians}} experience sickness <b>certification</b> <b>tasks</b> as problematic. More knowledge is needed about physicians ’ own opinions on this matter. Aim: To further describe {{the experiences of}} physicians regarding their task of sickness certification. Methods: Qualitative analyses of 622 written responses to an open-ended question on physicians ’ own opinions about sickness certification given in a comprehensive questionnaire that comprised 83 close-ended items about this matter. The questionnaire was sent to 7665 physicians in Sweden and the response rate was 71 %. Results: The physicians stated that they {{found it difficult to}} provide sickness certificates and expressed frustration over an altered concept of disease, problems in assessing work capacity, lack of time, labour market issues, limited resources for care and rehabilitation, and lack of management and support in their work. They also felt that their authority has diminished and that it was hard to combine the two roles of being patients ’ advocate and a medical expert. Consequently, they felt distressed and suggested that several types of changes be made, including transfer of sickness <b>certification</b> <b>tasks</b> to specialized physicians, multi-professional teams, or specialized clinics, and introduction of specific guidelines for certification. Conclusions: Physicians state several types of problems related to sickness <b>certification</b> <b>tasks</b> and many lack support in handling these problems.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{two primary}} {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to the assess consultation load of occupational health physicians (OHPs), and their difficulties and needs with regard to their sickness <b>certification</b> <b>tasks</b> in sick-listed employees with severe medical unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS). Third objective was to determine which disease-, patient-, doctor- and practice-related factors are associated with the difficulties and needs of the OHPs. Methods In this cross-sectional study, 43 participating OHPs from 5 group practices assessed 489 sick-listed employees with and without severe MUPS. The OHPs filled in a questionnaire about difficulties concerning sickness <b>certification</b> <b>tasks,</b> consultation time, their needs with regard to consultation with or referral to a psychiatrist or psychologist, and communication with GPs. The OHPs also completed a questionnaire about their personal characteristics. Results OHPs only experienced task difficulties in employees with severe MUPS in relation to their communication with the treating physician. This only occured in cases in which the OHP attributed the physical symptoms to somatoform causes. If they attributed the physical symptoms to mental causes, the OHPs reported a need to consultate a psychiatrist about the diagnosis and treatment. Conclusions OHPs experience few difficulties with their sickness <b>certification</b> <b>tasks</b> and consultation load concerning employees with severe MUPS. However, they encounter problems if the diagnostic uncertainties of the treating physician interfere with the return to work process. OHPs have a need for psychiatric expertise whenever they are uncertain about the psychiatric causes of a delayed return to work process. We recommend further training programs for OHPs. They should also have more opportunity for consultation and referral to a psychiatrist, and their communication with treating physicians should be improved. </p...|$|E

The advantage of this DI protocol over the conventional quantum protocol is that randomness can be certified even when experimental apparatuses are not trusted. Quantum entanglement is the necessary physical source for the nonlocal correlation required for such DI task. However, nonlocality and entanglement are distinct concepts. There exist entangled states which produce no nonlocal correlation and hence are not useful for the DI randomness <b>certification</b> <b>task.</b> Here we introduce the measurement-device-independent randomness <b>certification</b> <b>task</b> where one has trusted quantum state preparation device but the measurement devices are completely unspecified.

40|$|Abstract. A {{technique}} for elegantly expressing In-lined Reference Monitor (IRM) certification as model-checking is presented and implemented. In-lined Reference Monitors (IRM’s) enforce software security policies by in-lining dynamic security guards into untrusted binary code. Certifying IRM systems provide strong formal guarantees for such systems by verifying that the instrumented code {{produced by the}} IRM system satisfies the original policy. Expressing this certification step as model-checking allows well-established model-checking technologies {{to be applied to}} this often difficult <b>certification</b> <b>task.</b> The technique is demonstrated through the enforcement and certification of a URL anti-redirection policy for ActionScript web applets. ...|$|R

An advanced motion simulator {{was used to compare}} the performance and handling characteristics of three representative large jet transports during specific flight <b>certification</b> <b>tasks.</b> Existing regulatory constraints and methods for determining rotation speed were reviewed, and the effects on takeoff performance of variations in rotation speed, pitch attitude, and pitch attitude rate during the rotation maneuver were analyzed. A limited quantity of refused takeoff information was obtained. The aerodynamics, wing loading, and thrust-to-weight ratio of the subject SST resulted in takeoff speeds limited by climb (rather than lift-off) considerations. Take-off speeds based on U. S. subsonic transport requirements were found unacceptable because of the criticality of rotation-abuse effects on one-engine-inoperative climb performance. Adequate safety margin was provided by takeoff speeds based on proposed Anglo-French supersonic transport (TSS) criteria, with the limiting criterion being that takeoff safety speed be at least 1. 15 times the one-engine-inoperative zero-rate-of-climb speed.

40|$|The {{financial}} crisis {{drew attention to}} the crucial role of transparency and the independence of financial certification intermediaries, in particular, statutory auditors. Now any anticompetitive practice involving coordinated increases in prices or concomitant changes in quality that impacts financial information affects the effectiveness of this intermediation. It is therefore not surprising that the competitive analysis of the audit market is a critical factor in regulating financial systems, all the more so as this market is marked by various barriers to entry, such as the incompatibility of <b>certification</b> <b>tasks</b> with the preparation of financial statements or consulting, the expertise on (and the ability to apply) international standards for the presentation of financial information, the need to attract top young graduates, the prohibition of advertising, or the two-sided nature of this market where the quality of financial information results from the interaction between the reputation of auditors and audited firms. Against this backdrop, we propose a legal and economic study of the risks of collective dominance in the statutory audit market in France using the criteria set by Airtours case and, in particular, by analyzing how regulatory obligations incumbent on statutory auditors may favour the appearance of tacit collusion. Our analysis suggests that nothing prevents collective dominance of the auditors of the Big Four group in France to exist, which is potentially detrimental to {{the economy as a whole}} as the audit industry may fail to provide the optimal level of financial information.

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{reactive}} system specification, the <b>certification</b> <b>task</b> usually consists in ensuring that some envisaged property of the system behaviour follows from the specification.

Therefore, whenever a property is not inferred from the specification, we can not just add it as a new specification axiom and traditional certification approaches do not use to provide help on how the specification could be enriched.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} determining the presence of genuine multipartite entanglement through the violation of Mermin's Bell-type inequality (MI). Though the violation of MI cannot certify the presence of genuine nonlocality, but can certify genuine tripartite entanglement whenever the violation is strictly greater than 2 √(2). Here we show that MI suffices as genuine entanglement witness even when its value is 2 √(2) if {{at least two of}} the local marginal distributions are not completely random provided the local Hilbert space dimension of at least one of the sub-systems is two. Thus local marginals suffice as semi-device independent genuine entanglement witness. This is intriguing in a sense, as the local properties of a composite system can help to identify its global property. Furthermore, analyzing another quantity constructed from Mermin polynomials we show that genuine entanglement <b>certification</b> <b>task</b> for the correlations with MI violation equal to 2 √(2) can actually be made fully device independent.

40|$|Certified {{computation}} of {{the sign}} of a matrix determinant is a central problem in computational geometry. The certification by the known methods is practically difficult because the magnitude of the determinant of an integer input matrix A may vary dramatically, from 1 to jjAjj n, and the roundoff error bound of the determinant computation varies proportionally. Because of such a variation, high precision computation of det A is required to ensure that the error bound is smaller than the magnitude of the determinant. We observe, however, that our <b>certification</b> <b>task</b> of determining only a single bit of det A, that is, the bit carrying the sign, does not require to estimate the latter roundoff error. Instead, we solve a much simpler task of computing numerically the factorizaion of a matrix by Gaussian elimination with pivoting and of estimating the minimum distance 1 =jjA Γ 1 jj from A to a singular matrix. Such an estimate gives us a desired range for the roundoff error of the f [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Many psychiatrists are {{involved}} in sickness certification of their patients; however, there is very limited knowledge about this aspect of their work. The objective {{of this study was}} to explore frequencies of problematic issues in the sickness <b>certification</b> <b>tasks</b> and experiences of severity regarding these problematic issues among psychiatrists. Methods A cross-sectional nationwide questionnaire study to all physicians in Sweden. The 579 specialists in psychiatry who answered the questionnaire, were under 65 years of age, worked mainly in psychiatric care, and had consultations involving sickness certification at least once a week were included. Results The frequency of problematic sickness certification consultations a few times per year or more often was considered by 87. 3 % of the psychiatrists; 11. 7 % handle such cases at least once a week. A majority (60. 9 %) reported ‘not having enough time with the patient’ at least once a week. The psychiatrists had access to several categories of professionals in their daily work. More than one third certified unnecessarily long sick-leave periods at least once a month due to waiting times for Social Insurance Office investigations or for treatments or investigations within health care. Conclusion The majority found it problematic to assess the level and duration of work incapacity, but also other types of problems like unnecessarily long sick-leave periods due to different types of waiting times. The findings have implications for different kinds of organisational and managerial support and training in sickness certification issues, like guidance to assess the level and duration of work incapacity. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Sickness absence is {{a common}} ‘‘prescription’ ’ in health care in many Western countries. Despite the {{significance}} of sick-listing for the life situation of patients, physicians have limited training in how to handle sickness-certification cases and the research about sickness-certification practices is scarce. Aim: gain knowledge on physicians ’ learning regarding management of sickness certification of patients in formal, informal, and non-formal learning situations, respectively, and possible changes in this from 2004 to 2008. Methods: Data from two comprehensive questionnaires to physicians in Sweden about their sickness-certification practice in 2004 (n 7665) and 2008 (n 36898); response rates: 71 % and 61 %, respectively. Answers from all the physicians 64 years old and who had sickness <b>certification</b> <b>tasks</b> (n 4019 and n 14210) were analysed. Outcome measures: ratings of importance {{of different types of}} learning situations for their sickness-certification competence. Results: Few physicians stated that formal learning situations had contributed to a large or fairly large extent to their competence in sickness certification, e. g. undergraduate studies had done that for 17 %, internship for 37 %, and resident training for 46 %, respectively. Contacts with colleagues had been helpful for 65 %. One-third was helped by training arranged by social insurance offices. There was a significant increase between 2004 and 2008 in all items related to formal and non-formal learning situations, while there were no changes regarding informal learning situations.

One way to acquire such knowledge is to consider “reflection-in-action”, aspects of which are expressed in the physician’s interpretation of the patient’s story. The {{aim of this study}} was to gain knowledge about the meaning content of case reports about problematic sickness certification. Specifically, we looked for possible messages to the colleagues intended to read the reports. A narrative approach was used to analyse reports about problematic sickness certification cases that had been written by GPs and occupational health service physicians as part of a sickness insurance course. The analysis included elements from both thematic and structural analysis. Nineteen case reports were used in the actual analysis and 25 in the validation of the results. Main narrative qualities and structural features of the written case reports were explored. Five types of messages were identified in the case reports, here classified as “a call for help”, “a call for understanding”, “hidden worries”, “in my opinion”, and “appearing neutral”. In the reports, the physicians tried to achieve neutrality in their writing, and the patients’ stories tended to be interpreted within a traditional biomedical framework. In some cases there was an open request for help, in others it was not obvious that the physician had any problems. Overall, the messages were about having problems as such, rather than the specific features of the problems. The case reports clearly demonstrated different ways of writing about problems that arise during sickness certification, from being neutral and not mentioning the problems to being emotionally involved and asking for help. The general character of the messages suggests that they are also relevant for case reports in problematic areas other than sickness certification. If pertinent relationships can be found between reflection-inpractice and the narrative writing about practice, they will provide an approach to further research concerning consultations perceived as problematic and also to medical education...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Physicians have an {{important}} but problematic task to issue sickness certifications. A manifold of studies have identified {{a wide spectrum of}} medical and insurance-related problems in sickness certification. Despite educational efforts aiming to improve physicians’ knowledge of social insurance medicine there are no signs of reduction of these problems. We hypothesised that the quality deficits is not only due to lack of knowledge among issuing physicians. The aim {{of the study was to}} explore physicians’ challenges when handling sickness certification in relation to their professional roles as physicians and to their interaction with different stakeholders. Methods One hundred seventy-seven physicians in Stockholm County, Sweden, participated in a sick-listing audit program. Participants identified challenges in handling sick-leave issues and formulated action plans for improvement. Challenges and responsible stakeholders were identified in the action plans. To deepen the understanding facilitators of the program were interviewed. A qualitative content analysis was performed exploring challenge categories and categories of stakeholders with responsibility to initiate actions to improve the quality of the sick-listing process. The challenge categories were then related by their content to professional competence roles in accord with the Canadian Medical Education Directions for Specialists (CanMEDS) framework and to the stakeholder categories. Results Seven categories of challenges were identified. Practitioner patient interaction, Work capacity assessment, Interaction with the Social Insurance Administration, The patient’s workplace and the labour market, Sick-listing practice, Collaboration and resource allocation within the Health Care System, Leadership and routines at the Health Care Unit. The challenges were related to all seven CanMEDS roles. Five categories of stakeholders were identified and several stakeholders were involved in each challenge category. Conclusions Physicians performing sickness <b>certification</b> <b>tasks</b> experience a complex variety of challenges. From physician perspective actions to handle these need to be initiated in interaction with both medical and non-medical stakeholders. The relation between the challenges and a well-established professional competence framework revealed a complex pattern. Thus, from a public health perspective, educational activities aimed to improve the sick-listing process should address all physician competences including identification and interaction with stakeholders, and not just knowledge of social insurance medicine. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Managers and {{physicians}} have two {{important roles in}} healthcare organisations. However, several studies have identified problems in the manager–physician relationship and more knowledge is needed to improve the situation. Using theories on organisation, professions, and role taking to inform thinking, this thesis addresses {{one aspect of the}} manager-physician relationship, namely how managers handle their role in relation to the medical profession. This was studied in the context of sickness certification, a frequent and problematic task for many physicians in Sweden. Aim: The aim of this thesis was to increase the knowledge about how managers in Swedish healthcare organisations handle their manager role in relation to the medical profession. Methods: The empirical studies (I-IV) build on one another. Focus group discussions with 26 physicians (I), two questionnaires to all board-certified specialists in Stockholm county (n= 2497, resp. n= 2208) (II), individual interviews with 18 county council chief executive officers (CEOs) (III), and interviews with 38 healthcare managers (20 clinical department managers (CDMs) and the same 18 CEOs as in study III) (IV) constitute the database for the thesis. Qualitative methods were used to analyse data in three of the studies: content analysis (I), grounded theory (III), and linguistic discourse analysis (IV). Descriptive statistics were used in study II. Results: The problems physicians described in their work with sickness certification could be classified into four categories: the design of the social insurance system, the organisation of healthcare, the performance of other stakeholders, and the physicians’ own work situation. Although all of these concern policy issues and managerial responsibility on different structural levels in healthcare, the role of managers was absent in the physicians’ discussions (I). When specifically asked about management of sickness certification issues, the majority reported lack of both substantial management support and a well-established workplace policy (II). With these findings as a point of departure, studies III and IV addressed managers’ role taking. In many ways managers themselves contributed to making the manager role weak and absent in relation to the medical profession (III, IV). The CEOs had a strong focus on physicians {{and physicians}}’ behaviour rather than on their own managerial behaviour or that of their subordinate managers. When strategies for managing physicians were addressed, many described physician-specific strategies that led to a paradox of control in relation to the medical profession - the pragmatic strategies helped managers to manage physicians in daily work, but seemed to weaken the manager role in the organisation (III). Few managers used a management-based discourse to construct the manager role. Instead, a profession-based discourse was predominant, where managers frequently used the attributes “physician” or “non-physician” to categorise themselves and other managers in their manager roles. Some managers also combined the two discourses in a “yes, but [...] . ” approach to management in the organisation. Expressions of a mutually shared manager community were almost totally missing in the managers’ statements (IV). Conclusions: The results show that managers have a weak, partially absent, and rather ambiguous manager role in relation to the medical profession. How the manager role is handled and regarded within healthcare organisations constitutes part of the organisational conditions for the role taking of managers, physicians, and other healthcare professionals. The findings indicate {{that there is a need}} to support healthcare managers in their role taking in the organisation - both those managers who also are physicians, and managers with other underlying professions. Management aspects regarding sickness <b>certification</b> <b>tasks</b> also need to be strengthened. A weak and ambiguous manager role may have negative consequences not only for the work of managers, but also for that of physicians and other healthcare professionals, and for the quality of care...|$|E

40|$|Background: Administration of {{sickness}} absence involves many stakeholders, among them physicians, who {{play a key}} role in the sickness insurance systems in most western countries. Despite the impact that sickness absence can have on the life situation of the affected individual, physicians have limited training in how to handle sickness certification cases, and very little research has examined the practices of those medical professionals in this context. Aims: The overall aim of the present research was to gain more detailed knowledge about sickness certification performed by physicians, as a basis for interventions. Study I was conducted to determine the frequency of having consultations concerning sickness certification, and nature of problems experienced in relation to this task by physicians in different clinical settings. Study II explored the problems and characteristics of the daily work with sickness certification, as perceived by board certified specialists working in primary health care or orthopaedics. Study III examined the knowledge and skills that physicians stated they needed in this area. Study IV aimed to ascertain what types of learning situations helped physicians improve their competence in this certification task. Methods: Two comprehensive questionnaires about sickness certification practices were administered to physicians in 2004 and 2008, respectively. In 2004, 7665 physicians from Stockholm and Östergötland Counties were included; in 2008, all 36898 physicians living and working in Sweden were included. The response rates were 71 % and 61 %, respectively. Answers from all physicians aged ≤ 64 years who had sickness <b>certification</b> <b>tasks</b> (n = 4019 and n = 14210, respectively) were evaluated using descriptive statistics, correlation analyses, logistic regressions, linear regressions, and analyses of variance. Results: In 2004, 74 % (n = 4019) of the respondents had consultations including sickness certification at least a few times a year, and about half of those had such consultations at least six times a week. The following items were rated as very or fairly problematic by the largest proportion of physicians: handling conflicts with patients about certification, assessing work capacity, estimating optimal length and degree of absence, and managing prolongation of sick leave initially certified by another physician (study I). Many physicians answered that they needed more knowledge and skills in handling sickness certification, for instance regarding assessment of work capacity (44 %), the optimal length and degree of absence (50 %), and information about aspects of the social insurance system (43 63 %). Fewer (20 %) reported needing to know more about how to fill out sickness certificates (study III). In 2008, relatively small proportions of the physicians stated that formal learning situations had to a large or fairly large extent contributed to their competence in sickness certification, for example 17 % indicated this for undergraduate studies, 37 % for internship, and 46 % for resident training. However, 65 % felt that contacts with colleagues and other health care staff had been beneficial, whereas only one-third (33 %) had been helped by training arranged by Social Insurance Office. Between 2004 and 2008, a small but significant increase was noted for all items related to formal learning situations and continuing professional development, while there were no changes regarding informal learning situations such as contacts with colleagues and patients (study IV). In general, the results varied considerably between physicians in different clinical settings. In orthopaedics, 83 % handled sickness certification cases ≥ 6 times a week, as compared to 62 % in primary health care. However, the rate of problems concerning sickness certification was highest for those in primary care and lowest among those in internal medicine and surgery (study I). Those working in primary health care and psychiatry also had larger needs for knowledge and skills compared to other groups. These differences were still observed after adjusting for sex, years in practice, workplace policy, and support from management (study III). Compared to physicians in orthopaedics, a greater proportion of general practitioners experienced having support from management in the certification task, and more of them indicated that there was a common strategy for handling this duty at their workplaces (study II). Conclusions: Handling sickness certification was observed to be a very common task among physicians working in many different clinical settings, not only primary health care, which has been the focus of previous studies and interventions. Therefore, this should be recognized as a very common task for most physicians, at least in Sweden. Many aspects {{of sickness}} certification were experienced as problematic, but the nature and frequency of the difficulties varied greatly between physicians in different clinics/practices. A majority of the physicians answered that they needed more skills and knowledge in managing this task, and previous learning had occurred primarily in clinical practice, not through formal education. The high rate of problems and the lack of both knowledge and formal education about how to manage sickness certification may have consequences for the physicians work situation, for patients, and for society. Efforts are warranted to educate physicians in sickness certification on both the undergraduate and the postgraduate level, and to provide workplace strategies for improving the prerequisites for handling this task. Further research: Further research should consider sickness certification by physicians in fields other than general practice, such as oncology, surgery, and internal medicine. Studies about how the sickness certification task is learned and what the knowledge acquired actually includes are warranted. For example research about how physicians develop rules of thumb or mindlines in this field, and what they entail...|$|E
40|$|Dynamic languages, like Python, are {{attractive}} because they guarantee that no correct program is rejected prematurely. However, this {{comes at a}} price of losing early error detection, and making both code optimization and <b>certification</b> harder <b>tasks</b> when compared with static typed languages. Having the static certification of Python programs as a goal, we developed a static type inference system for a subset of Python, known as RPython. Some dynamic features are absent from RPython, nevertheless it is powerful enough as a Python dialect and exhibits most of its main features. Our type inference system tackles with almost all language constructions, such as object inheritance and subtyping, polymorphic and recursive functions, exceptions, generators, modules, etc., and is itself written in Python...|$|R

The EU ATEX 100 A Directive 94 / 9 /EC has introduced Essential Safety Requirements and a categorisation system. EN 954, under the Machinery Directive, has a different categorisation system for safety-related devices. A categorisation system needs to be developed which is compatible with these and with standards for safety-critical control systems, such as IEC 61508. Objectives (1) To draft a description of appropriate subdivisions of safety devices. (2) To define all safety devices which {{are used in the}} context of electrical equipment for use in potentially explosive atmospheres and study their characteristics and performance in terms of the defined subdivisions. (3) To draft a method for identifying when a particular subdivision should be used, taking into account the application and working environment of the equipment. (4) To determine the correspondence between the proposed subdivisions and the relevant essential safety requirements. Work programme Task 1 was to derive target failure measures {{in the context of the}} ATEX requirements. Task 2 was to assess standards such as EN 954 and IEC 61508 for suitability in specifying and certifying that the required target failure measures have been achieved. Task 3 was to identify the types of safety devices which are currently in use. Task 4 was to study these safety devices to determine their characteristics and performance in relation to the target failure measures. Task 5 was to determine a methodology for testing, validation and <b>certification.</b> <b>Task</b> 6 was to prepare the current report and proposals for standardisation...|$|R

40|$|In {{semiconductor}} manufacturing, {{the performance}} of metrology equipment directly impacts yield. Fabs and equipment suppliers depend on calibration standards {{to ensure that their}} metrology results are within tolerances and to maintain their ISO [1] and QS [2] quality <b>certifications.</b> This <b>task</b> becomes more challenging as the device features shrink and tolerances become tighter, to the extent of their physical limits in many cases. As the industry keeps finding ways to meet the demanding metrology requirements, calibration standards have been developed and enhanced for all essential measurements, i. e. critical dimensions, thin films, surface topography, overlay, doping, and defect inspections. This paper provides an overview of such standards and demonstrates how they are certified and tested to be traceable to the International System (SI) unit of length in order to ensure reliable and transferable calibrations for fabs. The latest results on 50 nm Critical Dimension (CD) standards, 2 nm film thickness standards, and 50 nm particle sizing standards, along with their certification strategies, are also presented...|$|R
