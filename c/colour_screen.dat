5|$|This second version {{contained}} no significant changes {{from the original}} 1937 one, although the black-and-white television screen that {{had appeared in the}} 1930s version was now depicted as a <b>colour</b> <b>screen,</b> despite the fact that such technology was not yet available.|$|E
25|$|Compared to the {{previous}} generation, more sporting trim highlights {{are used in the}} cabin and the centre dash incorporates real aluminium. The already considerable rear leg-room has been increased over previous models. Tri-zone climate control systems feature {{for the first time that}} can regulate the car's temperature at three separate places inside the cabin. Themes for the specialist interior design team were comfort, sophistication, harmony, luxury and attention to detail. The extroverted instrument pad features a wide binnacle, unique chrome-ringed instrument cluster and integrated centre stack with a high resolution <b>colour</b> <b>screen,</b> zoned audio and climate controls and satin chrome detailing.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Archos {{released}} the first [...] "portable media player" [...] (PMP), the Archos Jukebox Multimedia {{with a little}} 1.5" [...] <b>colour</b> <b>screen.</b> Manufacturers have since implemented abilities to view images and play videos into their devices. The next year, Archos released another multimedia jukebox, the AV300, with a 3.8" [...] screen and a 20GB hard drive.|$|E

5000|$|The Samsung Galaxy R uses a 108.5 mm WVGA Super CLEAR LCD (SC-LCD) {{capacitive}} touchscreen. It has a 4.2" [...] 16 million <b>colours</b> <b>screen,</b> {{without using}} the Pentile matrix.|$|R
25|$|Planar {{graphics}} are used, {{with up to}} 5 bitplanes (4 in hires); {{this allowed}} 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 <b>colour</b> <b>screens,</b> from a palette of 4096 colours. Two special graphics modes were also included: Extra HalfBrite, which used a 6th bitplane as a mask that halved the brightness of any colour seen, and Hold And Modify (HAM), which allowed all 4096 <b>colours</b> on <b>screen</b> at once.|$|R
50|$|The <b>colour</b> <b>screen</b> {{plate was}} usually {{sold as a}} {{separate}} item to the panchromatic negatives. A single <b>colour</b> <b>screen</b> plate could be placed into the camera and used to expose many negatives in succession. The resultant negatives looked like standard black-and-white negatives, with a noticeable crosshatch patterning in areas of strong colour.|$|E

5000|$|A {{separate}} keyboard with 114 keys {{connected to}} the main unit using a reversed British telephone plug with the clip on the left hand side. Most monitors were amber monochrome but later <b>colour</b> <b>screens</b> were sold.|$|R
50|$|An {{operator}} sat {{in front}} of a device that vaguely resembles today's PC, except the monitor was small, expensive (US$2,000), low-resolution (24x80) and the available colors were green and bright green. <b>Colour</b> <b>screens</b> (7 <b>colours)</b> arrived later.|$|R

50|$|The 1100 {{is similar}} to the {{discontinued}} 5110/3210/3310 models that were among the most popular mobile phones in the world during their time, before handsets developed several new features such as cameras, polyphonic ringtones and <b>colour</b> <b>screens.</b>|$|R
50|$|Transparency positives {{could be}} made from the system's {{panchromatic}} negatives by contact printing; these positives were then bound in register with a <b>colour</b> viewing <b>screen</b> of the same type as used for exposure, to reproduce the image in colour. Multiple copies could be printed from each negative, the resultant positives each being registered with their own <b>colour</b> viewing <b>screens.</b> If, on the other hand, a black-and-white print was required, the negative was used and the <b>colour</b> viewing <b>screen</b> ignored.|$|R

50|$|The {{system used}} two glass plates, {{one of which}} was the <b>colour</b> <b>screen</b> plate while the other was a {{standard}} black-and-white negative plate. The <b>colour</b> <b>screen</b> plate comprised a series of red, green and blue filters, laid down in a regular pattern of lines to form a réseau, or matrix. Because the negatives of the time required long exposure times, the colours in the screen plate were diluted to let more light through to the negative, resulting in a quicker exposure. A viewing screen with more intense colour filters was used in combination with the developed positive to project a composite colour image.|$|E

40|$|At high {{temperatures}} or densities, hadronic matter shows {{different forms of}} critical behaviour: colour deconfinement, chiral symmetry restoration, and diquark condensation.

40|$|Hard, {{penetrating}} probes, such {{as heavy}} quarkonium states, provide an essential tool {{to study the}} early and hot stage of heavy-ions collisions. In particular {{they are expected to}} be sensitive to Quark-Gluon Plasma formation. In the presence of a deconfined medium (i. e. QGP) with high enough energy density, quarkonium states are dissociated because of <b>colour</b> <b>screening.</b> This leads to a suppression of their production rates...|$|R

50|$|Advantages of the Paget {{system was}} that Paget plates were more {{sensitive}} than contemporary autochrome plates, allowing exposures of around 1/25 second (four times faster than autochrome), plus it was a negative/positive process with a separate <b>colour</b> <b>screen</b> which meant that multiple prints were straightforward to produce.|$|E
