25|$|Light {{blue and}} blue-grey work uniforms were also issued to RLAF ground and flight personnel, which {{consisted}} of a light <b>cotton</b> <b>shirt</b> and pants. The former {{was based on the}} French Army's M1948 shirt (French: Chemise de toile Mle 1948) which featured a six-buttoned front and two pleated breast pockets closed by pointed flaps, was provided with shoulder straps (French: Epaulettes) and had long sleeves with buttoned cuffs.

500|$|Workhouses were {{designed}} {{with only a}} single entrance guarded by a porter, through which inmates and visitors alike had to pass. Near to the entrance were the casual wards for tramps and vagrants and the relieving rooms, where paupers were housed until they had been examined by a medical officer. After being assessed the paupers were separated and allocated to the appropriate ward for their category: boys under 14, able-bodied men between 14 and 60, men over 60, girls under 14, able-bodied women between 14 and 60, and women over 60. Children {{under the age of}} two were allowed to remain with their mothers, but by entering a workhouse paupers were considered to have forfeited responsibility for their families. Clothing and personal possessions were taken from them and stored, to be returned on their discharge. After bathing, they were issued with a distinctive uniform: for men it might be a striped <b>cotton</b> <b>shirt,</b> jacket and trousers, and a cloth cap, and for women a blue-and-white striped dress worn underneath a smock. Shoes were also provided. [...] In some establishments certain categories of inmate were marked out by their clothing, such as at Bristol Incorporation workhouse, where prostitutes were required to wear a yellow dress and pregnant single women a red dress; such practices were deprecated by the Poor Law Commission in a directive issued in 1839 entitled [...] "Ignominious Dress for Unchaste Women in Workhouses", but they continued until at least 1866. Some workhouses had a separate [...] "foul" [...] or [...] "itch" [...] ward, where inmates diagnosed with skin diseases such as scabies could be detained before entering the workhouse proper.|$|E
2500|$|During World War II, a single-breasted heavy {{cotton twill}} jacket with {{shoulder}} boards was worn with cotton twill trousers over a long-sleeved <b>cotton</b> <b>shirt</b> {{with a black}} necktie as [...] "Service Dress Khaki", allowing cleaning in shipboard laundry facilities. Later on, through the Vietnam War, the trousers and jacket were often made of light wool or wool-blend fabric [...] as routine access to dry-cleaning facilities became available. The uniform was dropped in 1975 by then-Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, {{in order to reduce}} the number of items in the officer's seabag. A revived version of the uniform was announced in 2006 on a test basis. It was authorized for wear by commissioned officers and CPOs during the summer months and in tropical climates. Some commentators, including the periodical Navy Times, spoke of this uniform as having a [...] "throwback" [...] look.|$|E

2500|$|Upon its {{formation}} at the mid-1950s, Laotian Aviation personnel {{received the}} French Army's M1945 tropical working and service dress (French: Tenue de toile kaki clair Mle 1945), standard {{issue in the}} ANL, consisting of a light khaki <b>cotton</b> <b>shirt</b> and pants. Modelled after the WWII US Army tropical [...] "Chino" [...] working dress, the shirt had two patch breast pockets closed by clip-cornered straight flaps and shoulder straps whilst the trousers featured two pleats at the front hips, side slashed pockets and an internal pocket at the back, on the right side. In alternative, the short-sleeved M1946 (French: Chemisette kaki clair Mle 1946) – which had two pleated patch breast pockets closed by pointed flaps – and M1949 (French: Chemisette kaki clair Mle 1949) khaki shirts could be worn with the matching M1946 khaki shorts (French: Culotte courte kaki clair Mle 1946) in hot weather. Laotian Aviation ground personnel in the field often wore the standard ANL French all-arms M1947 drab green fatigues (French: Treillis de combat Mle 1947).|$|E
2500|$|Besides ex-Lebanese Army {{olive green}} fatigues, a light khaki work uniform was also issued to PLA combat troops, which {{consisted}} of a <b>cotton</b> <b>shirt</b> and pants. The shirt featured a six-buttoned front and two pleated breast pockets closed by pointed flaps, was provided with shoulder straps and had long sleeves with buttoned cuffs. It was worn with matching trousers, which had two side slashed pockets, two pleated cargo pockets closed by straight, dual-buttoned flaps, and two internal pockets at the back, closed by pointed flaps. Camouflage uniforms consisted of surplus US Highland pattern (ERDL 1948 Leaf pattern or [...] "Woodland pattern") fatigues, West German Bundeswehr 1956 Splinter pattern jackets, Syrian copies of the Pakistani Brushstroke (nicknamed [...] "Wisp") fatigues, captured U.S. Woodland Battle Dress Uniforms (BDU) and Palestinian Brushstroke fatigues; the latter was a PLO Brushstroke variation incorporating very dark olive and purplish-brown strokes with very long and thin brush trails on a sandy-colored background. The PLA did developed though their own unique camouflage pattern, a hybrid lizard/Pakistani brushstroke design, which was locally-produced. T-shirts in US Highland pattern were sometimes seen. Syrian-supplied OG US M-1965 field jackets, Israeli olive Dubon Parkas and ex-PLO Pakistani Army olive-brown woollen pullovers (aka 'woolly-pullies') with breast pockets and shoulder straps, were worn in cold weather.|$|E

50|$|It is also {{believed}} that wearing abrasive clothing may increase the chances to get infected {{with this type of}} virus.

50|$|According to {{documents}} at the British National Archives in London, British army scientists and doctors tested {{the effects of}} mustard gas on over 500 British and Indian soldiers over a ten-year period. Beginning in the early 1930s, scientists at Rawalpindi sent Indian soldiers, wearing shorts and <b>cotton</b> <b>shirts,</b> into gas chambers to experience the effects of mustard gas. The scientists hoped to determine the appropriate dosage to use on battlefields. Many of the subjects suffered severe burns from their exposure to the gas.|$|R
60|$|I {{think the}} Bishop's example, {{so far as}} wearing apparel was concerned, must have fascinated father, for he wore the cheap <b>cotton</b> <b>shirt</b> of the laborer and the {{overalls}} with the narrow strap about the hips.

60|$|The tall, heavy-shouldered man {{broke out}} in a harsh laugh that was partly amusement, but mostly hysterical. Both he and the captain {{regarded}} McCoy with incredulity and amazement.

60|$|We {{did some}} more washing {{in the lake}} this morning, and, with our clothes hung about on the dead trees and rocks, the shore looked like washing-day at home.

50|$|Shirts {{are made}} of woven cloth. The natural fibers {{used in the past}} were cotton (the most frequent), linen (the oldest), ramie, wool or silk. Nowadays, {{artificial}} fibers such as polyester or polyester blends are often used, due to their low cost, despite being considered by most shirtmakers the poorest material, owing to less softness and breathability. However, while high quality <b>cotton</b> <b>shirts</b> can survive with care a few decades, a polyester/cotton blend may be used in more demanding environments. Linen produces a cool fabric that wrinkles heavily, and is mostly used in light summer <b>shirts.</b> <b>Cotton</b> is therefore the standard material for all but the cheapest shirts. Silk is occasionally worn, though it is hot to wear and has a marked sheen.|$|R
50|$|The Cayuse put the captives to work {{together}} with their members; the adults made clothing for the tribe.

The Cayuse eventually lost the war. They were forced to cede their land to the US and shared a reservation with the Umatilla and Walla Walla.|$|R
50|$|The Zoque {{traditional}} {{dress is}} worn almost exclusively by women, and on special occasions. Some elderly men in remote communities wear white <b>cotton</b> <b>shirts.</b> The women traditionally wear short-sleeved white blouses, with colourfully embroidered open necklines, and long poplin skirts in various colors. More recently they wear kneelength dresses in various bright colours with white lacy trims. Up {{to the recent}} past it was customary for married women to undress {{the upper half of}} the body while working in the heat. Younger generations of women have become more timid about exposing their breasts.|$|R
