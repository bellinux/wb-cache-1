5|$|Before the {{outbreak}} of war, RAF Bomber Command firmly believed that air power <b>could</b> <b>win</b> wars {{without the need for}} naval and land fighting. It was thought the bomber would always get through. Tightly flown bomber formations with heavy defensive armament were thought capable of warding off enemy fighters even without fighter escort. However, the RAF lacked a four-engine bomber with adequate defensive protection which could carry heavy bomb loads to German targets. The only possible targets that were within range of British bombers were the industrial regions of the Ruhr.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, {{almost half}} of the Tories' {{campaign}} funds were spent in Quebec, a province in which the party won only four of seventy-five seats. After the 1953 election, Tory MP Gordon Churchill studied the Canadian federal elections since Confederation. He concluded that the Progressive Conservatives were ill-advised to continue pouring money into Quebec in an effort to win seats in the province; the Tories <b>could</b> <b>win</b> at least a minority government by maximizing their opportunities in English-speaking Canada, and if the party could also manage to win twenty seats in Quebec, it could attain a majority. Churchill's conclusions were ignored by most leading Tories—except Diefenbaker.|$|E

5|$|Luis Gómez, an El Pais writer, {{believed}} that the route was designed to benefit the Italian participants, with there being three individual time trials, the team time trial being flat, and most stages being primarily flat. El Mundo writer Javier Dalmases {{believed that}} the route was purposefully less mountainous so that an Italian would win the race, citing that this route favored the likes of Giuseppe Saronni or Moreno Argentin. La Stampas Gian Paolo Ormezzano thought overall easiness of the course — the few mountains and summit finishes — added some mystery as to who <b>could</b> <b>win.</b>|$|E

5|$|After Leafs General Manager Pat Quinn {{was unwilling}} to give Joseph a {{four-year}} contract (he offered three years), he left after the 2001–02 season to sign with the Detroit Red Wings.

Joseph had also hinted at wanting to play for a team that <b>could</b> <b>win</b> it all, implying the Leafs were not such a team.
