40|$|Synchronising bushcricket males achieve {{synchrony}} by delaying their <b>chirps</b> {{in response}} to calling neighbours. In multi-male choruses, males that delay <b>chirps</b> {{in response to}} all their neighbours would remain silent {{most of the time}} and be unable to attract mates. This problem could be overcome if the afferent auditory system exhibited selective attention, and thus a male interacted only with a subset of neighbours. We investigated whether individuals of the bushcricket genus Mecopoda restricted their attention to louder <b>chirps</b> neurophysiologically, behaviourally and through spacing. We found that louder leading <b>chirps</b> were preferentially represented in the omega neuron but the representation of softer following <b>chirps</b> was not completely abolished. Following <b>chirps</b> that were 20 dB louder than leading <b>chirps</b> were better represented than leading <b>chirps.</b> During acoustic interactions, males synchronised with leading <b>chirps</b> even when the following <b>chirps</b> were 20 dB louder. Males did not restrict their attention to louder <b>chirps</b> during interactions but were affected by all <b>chirps</b> above a particular threshold. In the field, we found that males on average had only one or two neighbours whose calls were above this threshold. Selective attention is thus achieved in this bushcricket through spacing rather than neurophysiological filtering of softer signals...|$|R

5|$|River otters {{can produce}} a snarling growl or hissing bark when bothered, and a shrill whistle when in pain. When at play or traveling, they {{sometimes}} give off low, purring grunts. The alarm call, given when shocked or distressed by potential danger, is an explosive snort, made by expelling air through the nostrils. River otters also may use a birdlike <b>chirp</b> for communication over longer distances, but the most common sound heard {{among a group of}} otters is low-frequency chuckling.|$|E
5|$|In Blessing, Tennessee, Jared <b>Chirp,</b> while {{attempting}} to flee his home, is attacked by rattlesnakes inside his car and killed. Federal agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), after conferring with the completely ordinary Reverend Mackey, go to Reverend Enoch O'Connor's church, Church of God with Signs and Wonders, where Biblical literalism is stressed and snakes are used during his services. As such, O'Connor becomes the prime suspect. Later, a woman named Iris tells Reverend Mackey that she feels guilty because Jared called her on the night he died in order {{to talk to his}} girlfriend, Gracie.

5|$|Like other mouse lemurs, {{the gray}} mouse lemur uses {{what has been}} {{described}} as a harmonic whistle call that is lower in frequency and shorter in duration than its close relative, the brown mouse lemur. In addition, it has been found that the types of vocalizations emitted by the gray mouse lemur can be dependent upon the environment. In the more open dry forest habitats favored by the gray mouse lemur, trill calls are more common and effective since they carry faster and are less likely to be masked by the wind, while <b>chirp</b> calls are more common in the brown mouse lemur, which favors closed rain forest habitats.|$|E
5|$|USB2.0 devices use {{a special}} {{protocol}} during reset, called chirping, {{to negotiate the}} high bandwidth mode with the host/hub. A device that is USB2.0 High Speed capable first connects as a Full Speed device (D+ pulled high), but upon receiving a USB RESET (both D+ and D− driven LOW by host for 10 to 20ms) it pulls the D− line high, known as <b>chirp</b> K. This indicates to the host that the device is high bandwidth. If the host/hub is also HS capable, it chirps (returns alternating J and K states on D− and D+ lines) letting the device know that the hub operates at high bandwidth. The device has to receive at least three sets of KJ chirps before it changes to high bandwidth terminations and begins high bandwidth signaling. Because USB 3.0 uses wiring separate and additional to that used by USB2.0 and USB1.x, such bandwidth negotiation is not required.|$|E

40|$|Experimental and {{numerical}} {{study on}} <b>chirped</b> transient stimulated Raman scattering in ethanol have been performed.

However, the combined effects of group velocity dispersion and self-phase modulation offset the negative <b>chirps</b> during propagation, yielding higher conversion efficiency. This is a novel mechanism for controlling transient stimulated Raman scattering {{and is likely to}} be of importance for various applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Behavioural syndromes, {{defined as}} suites of {{correlated}} behaviours across different contexts, {{are used to}} characterize individual variability in behaviours. Males of the weakly electric fish species, Apteronotus leptorhynchus, produce electro-communication signals called <b>chirps.</b> <b>Chirps</b> {{are thought to be}} involved in agonistic signalling, as their relative incidence increases during agonistic conspecific interactions. However, high levels of individual variability in aggression obscure the role of <b>chirps</b> in mediating aggression. Here, I tested the presence of an aggression-boldness behavioural syndrome, and then considered the implications such a syndrome would have on <b>chirping</b> behaviours. Behavioural tests in anti-predation, object novelty, feeding, conspecific intrusion and novel environment exploration contexts revealed a syndrome involving only object novelty and feeding. We found no correlation between <b>chirping</b> behaviour and the assessed behaviours. Our results demonstrate that <b>chirps</b> represent a more complex communication system than previously suggested...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{temporal}} synchronization between the <b>chirped</b> signal pulse and the pumping pulse in an optical parametric <b>chirped</b> pulse amplification laser system is researched theoretically and experimentally. The {{results show that}} the gain of optical parametric amplification is sensitive to the temporal synchronization. Therefore, accurate temporal synchronization between the <b>chirped</b> signal pulse and the pumping pulse is essential to obtain high optical parametric amplification gain and stable output from an optical parametric <b>chirped</b> pulse amplification laser. Based on our 16. 7 -TW/ 120 -fs optical parametric <b>chirped</b> pulse amplification laser system with similar to 1 -ns pumping pulse duration and < 10 -ps time jitter between the signal and pumping pulse, the effect of the temporal synchronization on optical parametric <b>chirped</b> pulse amplification is demonstrated.

40|$|Abstract: We {{demonstrate}} a novel scheme for photonic generation of <b>chirped</b> millimeter-wave (MMW) pulse with ultrahigh time-bandwidth product (TBP).

Compared with the reported optical grating-based wavelength-to-time mapping techniques for <b>chirped</b> pulse generation, our approach eliminates the problem in limited frequency resolution of grating, which seriously limits the continuity, tunability, and TBP of the generated waveform. Furthermore, by changing the alternating current (AC) waveform of the driving signal to the sweeping laser, linearly or nonlinearly continuously <b>chirped</b> MMW pulse can be easily generated and switched.

25|$|Castro and Snowdon (2000) {{observed}} that aside from inconsistent adult-like chirping, cotton-top infants most often produce a prototype <b>chirp</b> that differs in vocalization structure from anything {{seen in the}} full adult range of vocalizations. Infants are thought to imitate adult speakers, which use differing calls in various contexts, but by using solely the infant prototypical <b>chirp.</b> For instance, adult cotton-tops are known to significantly {{reduce the amount of}} general alarm calling in the presence of infants. This is likely adapted so that adults in close proximity to the group's young do not attract attention of predators to infant-dense areas. Additionally, infants reduce their prototype chirping in the presence of predators. Whether infants are shadowing the calling behavior of adults or they are comprehending danger remains unclear. However, researchers argue that young cotton-top tamarins are able to represent semantic information regardless of immature speech production.|$|E
