5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 2000s (decade), the {{increased}} Indian gaming that McCain had helped bring about was a $23billion industry. He was twice <b>chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> Indian Affairs Committee, in 1995–1997 and 2005–2007, and his Committee helped expose the Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal.

In 1937 he sponsored the Black-Connery Bill, which sought to establish a national minimum wage and a maximum workweek of thirty hours. Although the bill was initially rejected in the House of Representatives, an amended version of it, which extended Black's original maximum workweek proposal to forty-four hours, was passed in 1938 (after Black left the Senate), becoming the Fair Labor Standards Act.|$|E
5|$|Mark Odom Hatfield (July 12, 1922– August 7, 2011) was an American {{politician}} and educator {{from the state}} of Oregon. A Republican, he served for 30years as a United States Senator from Oregon, and also as <b>chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> Appropriations Committee. A native Oregonian, he served in the United States Navy in the Pacific Theater during World War II after graduating from Willamette University. After the war he earned a graduate degree from Stanford University before returning to Oregon and Willamette as a professor.|$|E
5|$|Senators raised {{concerns}} that the Congress could either abuse such authority or neglect to enact any such legislation after the adoption of this proposal. Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver, the <b>Chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments, a long-time advocate for addressing the disability question, spearheaded the effort until {{he died of a}} heart attack on August 10, 1963. Senator Keating was defeated in the 1964 election, but Senator Roman Hruska of Nebraska took up Keating's cause as a new member of the Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments.|$|E

5|$|The Democrats lost {{seats in}} the Senate in the 1950 {{election}} cycle, and party leader Ernest McFarland removed Clinton Anderson as <b>chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> Democratic Reelection Committee, replacing him with Clements for the 1952 election cycle. Clements advocated better cooperation between his committee and the Democratic National Committee in 1952. However, Republicans won the presidency and both houses of Congress in 1952, and the Democratic National Committee talked openly of disbanding the Reelection Committee. Clements instead advised that his committee's responsibilities be expanded and that its activities become year-round rather than seasonal.|$|E
5|$|Thompson was the <b>Chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> Environmental Conservation Committee.

Thompson served on the Finance; Commerce, Economic Development and Small Business; Tourism, Recreation and Sports Development and Veterans, Homeland Security and Military Affairs committees.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Westside MAX {{project began}} in 1993. In November 1996, Hillsboro and TriMet named the yet-to-be-completed {{station at the}} western end of the project as the Mark O. Hatfield Government Center Station. Hatfield was {{retiring}} from 30 years as U.S. Senator and previously used his political clout as <b>Chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> Appropriations Committee to ensure funding for the project. In June 1998, after completion of the station but prior to its opening, government officials held a dedication ceremony at the station. Retired U. S.

5|$|Higginbotham's {{nomination}} {{was held up}} by Mississippi Senator James Eastland, the <b>chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> Judiciary Committee and a committed segregationist. Eastland delayed the nomination long enough so that, despite being passed by a subcommittee, Higginbotham's nomination lapsed {{following the death of}} President Kennedy, and {{the beginning of a new}} congressional term. He was ultimately appointed to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by President Lyndon Johnson as a recess appointment on January 6, 1964, and was confirmed by the Senate later that year. At the time of his appointment, he was 35 years old. Higginbotham became a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania, of Yale University, and of Thomas Jefferson University.|$|E
5|$|In the afternoon, {{the crew}} {{became the first}} shuttle crew to ever testify live from orbit in a United States Senate hearing.

The crew of Atlantis later spoke with reporters from the major networks CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, and FOX before going to sleep.|$|E
5|$|McCain {{entered the}} race for the Republican {{nomination}} for President in 2000, but he lost a heated primary season contest to George W. Bush of Texas. He secured the nomination in 2008 after coming back from early reversals, but was defeated by Democratic nominee Barack Obama in the general election, losing by a 365–173 electoral college margin. He subsequently adopted more orthodox conservative stances and attitudes and largely opposed actions of the Obama administration, especially in regard to foreign policy matters. By 2013, however, he had become a key figure in the Senate for negotiating deals on certain issues in an otherwise partisan environment. In 2015, McCain became <b>chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> Armed Services Committee.|$|E

5|$|One {{topic of}} {{particular}} importance to Pierce was the military. He challenged a bill which would expand {{the ranks of the}} Army's staff officers in Washington without any apparent benefit to line officers at posts {{in the rest of the}} country. He took an interest in military pensions, seeing abundant fraud within the system, and was named <b>chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> Committee on Military Pensions in the Twenty-sixth Congress (1839–1841). In that capacity, he urged the modernization and expansion of the Army, with a focus on militias and mobility rather than on coastal fortifications, which he considered outdated.|$|E
5|$|Sereno E. Payne, {{chairman}} of the House Ways and Means Committee, had held hearings in late 1908, and sponsored the resulting draft legislation. On balance, the bill reduced tariffs slightly, but when it passed the House in April 1909 and reached the Senate, the <b>chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> Finance Committee, Rhode Island Senator Nelson W. Aldrich, attached many amendments raising rates. This outraged progressives such as Wisconsin's Robert M. La Follette, who urged Taft {{to say that the}} bill was not in accord with the party platform. Taft refused, angering them. Taft insisted that most imports from the Philippines be free of duty, and according to Anderson, showed effective leadership on a subject he was knowledgeable on and cared about.|$|E
5|$|Several {{political}} changes preceded {{the passage of}} the settlement act. First, Senator Edmund Muskie (D-ME)who previously seemed supportive of a settlement, but was gaining national prominence on the issue of fiscal responsibility prior to the 1980 Democratic primarygave up his seat as <b>Chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> Budget Committee to accept President Carter's nomination for Secretary of State. Second, Governor Brennan's choice to replace Muskie (and thus inherit his predecessor's committee assignments) was George Mitchell (D-ME)who had supported the land claim as U.S. Attorney and possessed legal gravitas due to his tenure as a District Judge. Another factor affecting the final push for the settlement was the fear that, if Ronald Reagan won the 1980 presidential election, he would veto any settlement favorable toward the tribes.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} eleven presidents of Pakistan since the {{introduction}} of the post in 1956. The office was established when Pakistan was declared as a republic with the adoption of the 1956 constitution, and Saad Mirza became the first president of the country. Apart from these eleven, two acting presidents have also been in office for short periods of time. One of them, Wasim Sajjad, served as acting president on two non-consecutive occasions during 1993 and 1997–98. The president may remain in office for a tenure of five years. In the case where a president's term of office is terminated early or during the absence of the president, the <b>Chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> assumes office.|$|E
5|$|Biden was re-elected to the Senate six times, and was {{the fourth}} most senior senator {{at the time of}} his {{resignation}} to assume the Vice Presidency in 2009. He was a long-time member and former chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. He opposed the Gulf War in 1991, but advocated U.S. and NATO intervention in the Bosnian War in 1994 and 1995. He voted in favor of the resolution authorizing the Iraq War in 2002, but opposed the surge of U.S. troops in 2007. He has also served as <b>chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> Judiciary Committee, dealing with issues related to drug policy, crime prevention, and civil liberties, and led the legislative efforts for creation of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, and the Violence Against Women Act. He chaired the Judiciary Committee during the contentious U.S. Supreme Court nominations of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas.|$|E
5|$|Hatfield {{served as}} <b>Chairman</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> Committee on Appropriations on two {{different}} occasions.

Hatfield School of Government in the College of Urban and Public Affairs at Portland State University, and the Hatfield Marine Science Center in Newport. Outside of Oregon, a research center at the National Institutes of Health is also named in his honor for his support of medical research while in the Senate. Hatfield died in Portland on August 7, 2011, after a long illness.|$|E
