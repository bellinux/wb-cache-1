Club {{gave the}} episode a {{negative}} review, saying [...] "There are, however, brief moments when the episode’s creators {{prove that they}} can earn yuks {{at the expense of}} canned sitcom humor and bad movie clichés. Later in “Turkey Pot Die,” Cleveland and Junior try to liberate Lester’s turkeys, but Lester catches on and gives chase. First, Junior looks in his passenger side mirror. Then there’s a quick cut to Lester and his wife pursuing Cleveland. Then there’s a <b>crash</b> <b>zoom</b> in on Cleveland, who has his head sticking {{out of the side of}} the car as he squints at Lester. It’s not exactly a sophisticated visual cue, but it is proof that The Cleveland Show’s creators can infrequently be funny without trying too hard".|$|E
