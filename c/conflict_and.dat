40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this study is to address the {{relation}} between task <b>and</b> relationship <b>conflicts</b> at work <b>and</b> employee well-being. It seeks to examine psychological detachment from work during off-job time as a moderator in the relation between <b>conflicts</b> <b>and</b> well-being. Design/methodology/approach – In a field study, 291 white-collar employees completed survey measures of task conflicts, relationship conflicts, psychological detachment from work during off-job time, and well-being. Control variables included workload and job control. Findings – Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that employees experiencing high levels of task <b>conflicts</b> <b>and</b> high levels of relationship conflicts report poorer well-being. As predicted, psychological detachment from work mitigated the negative relation between relationship <b>conflicts</b> <b>and</b> well-being. Contrary to expectations, psychological detachment failed to moderate the relation between task <b>conflicts</b> <b>and</b> well-being. Practical implications – The study suggests that employees should be encouraged to disengage mentally from work during leisure time. Originality/value – This study links research on workplace conflicts with research on recovery processes. It tests the moderator effect of psychological detachment from work on the association between workplace <b>conflicts</b> <b>and</b> well-being...|$|R
