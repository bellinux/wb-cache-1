50|$|Marie-Josée <b>Croze's</b> honour for Best Actress at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival was {{considered}} unlikely. She {{was not present}} to accept the award. The film's victory at France's national César Awards was also considered a surprise, since it is mainly a Quebec film. It received the most nominations at the 24th Genie Awards.|$|R
40|$|Sylvia Murr : Indology and militant Protestantism : Veyssière de La <b>Croze's</b> Histoire du Christianisme des Indes. La <b>Croze's</b> Histoire du Chistianisme des Indes (1724) {{provides}} an example of the utilisation of proto-ethnology in early 18 th-century religious disputes. This exiled monk converted to Calvinism uses an enquiry into the Jesuits' missions in India to support the Huguenots' arguments against the Catholics. Besides the book's importance in diffusing B. Ziegelbalg's original material on the Malabar religion, it was influential in providing support for the patristic thesis of the Egyptian origin of the Hindu Religion. In addition to its fusion of Brahmins and Catholic clergy into a single caricature of superstition and religious trickery, this work led the way to the Enlightenment's use of Indology against all religions.

50|$|The {{cast members}} from the {{previous}} film, including Dorothee Berryman, Louise Portal, Dominique Michel, Pierre Curzi and Yves Jacques, were easy to secure for the sequel. New to the cast was Marie-Josée Croze, who was selected by Arcand after starring in the Canadian films Maelstrom (2000) and Ararat (2002). She found Arcand allowed her freedom in how she interpreted her role. In The Decline of the American Empire, <b>Croze's</b> character Nathalie is played by child actress Ariane Frédérique.|$|R
50|$|Filming {{started in}} February 2012 on {{location}} in Morocco and lasted {{a month and a}} half, with most of the shooting done in sequence. The film was shot mainly in English, however there is also a substantial amount of Arabic dialogue between Moussa Maaskri and Roschdy Zem's characters as well as a some French dialogue, involving Zem's, Marie-Josée <b>Croze's</b> and Carlos Leal's characters. The key car crash scene was filmed practically, without visual effects, using DSLR cameras in the cars.|$|R
500|$|The film's {{plotting}} and characterisation {{was regarded}} flimsy by Nick Schager at The Village Voice, {{who added that}} the film's [...] "robust emotion and cultural detail" [...] offsets it. National Public Radio review by Scott Tobias stated that the film weds the exotic culture of the Romani to the cliched themes of a war film with its characterisation as its means. With a [...] "Schindlerian" [...] Theodore Rosier, a Dickensian Claude, a hinted romance between Rosier and Miss Lundi, and the clown-like Taloche, it added, Gatlif has [...] "weaved a tapestry out of the authentic and the chintzy". Joe Bendel at The Epoch Times stated that the film avoids simply depicting the Romani as victims, with its [...] "decidedly unsentimental" [...] central character, Taloche, who is [...] "wild {{almost to the point}} of being feral". Sophie Benamon at L'Express declared that the madness of Taloche is the pivotal element of the film. In Taloche's face, Nick Schager perceived that [...] "the film seethes with full-bodied fury and anguish". Arizona Reporters review lauded [...] "Taloche's manic antics" [...] as [...] "both the comic center of the film and a representation of the tragedy". Ronie Scheib (Variety) admired Taloche's characterisation, commenting on his acrobatic stunts and close-to-nature persona as gelling well with the film's title of [...] "Freedom". Lavoine's and <b>Croze's</b> characters also received a positive mention in the reviews at L'Express and The Epoch Times, [...] with Sophie Benamon at L'Express calling them [...] "compelling".|$|R
5000|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times {{gave the}} movie four stars {{and called it}} [...] "a movie with brains, indignation, irony and idealism". A.O Scott of The New York Times wrote [...] "what makes The Barbarian Invasions {{much more than a}} facile {{exercise}} in generational conflict is that Denys Arcand, who wrote and directed it, has a sense of history that is as acute as it is playful", adding [...] "The rapprochement between Remy and Sebastien is beautiful to watch" [...] and Marie-Josée <b>Crozes</b> [...] "spooky, melancholy intensity darkens the mood of buoyant sentimentality". Entertainment Weeklys Owen Glieberman gave the film a B-, noting Rémys hedonism. David Denby of The New Yorker gave credit to Stéphane Rousseau for [...] "a fascinatingly minimal performance". Jonathan Romney of The Independent wrote [...] "The film has its pros and cons, but you cant fault it for ambition: it not only muses on life and death, but also undertakes fairly comprehensive philosophical soundings of the way the world is today". Romney added Croze [...] "has simply the most nuanced presence here: thoughtful, introspective, with a reassuring warmth and lack of cartoonishness". Peter Bradshaw, writing for The Guardian, disdained the movie, calling it [...] "grotesquely overpraised", [...] "shot through with middlebrow sophistication, boorish cynicism, unfunny satire, a dash of fatuous anti-Americanism and unthinkingly reactionary sexual politics". English Professor Peter Brunette wrote [...] "its analysis of this state of affairs is all too often annoyingly rhetorical and, finally, altogether too facile".|$|R
500|$|A few critics {{suggested}} {{freedom as}} a theme {{in light of}} the importance shown by the characters to it. True to its title, which is a Romani word for freedom, [...] Gatlif used his freedom to direct a tangential, poignant romantic story with the historical documents available to him, unlike other movies with similar themes, remarked Jacques Mandelbaum at Le Monde. The Village Voice review declared that it is [...] "a magnificent paean to the mad ecstasy of freedom". The Arizona Reporter review added that, for the Romani, freedom means [...] "being able to keep in motion, that is, the journey, not the destination, is the reward". It observed the importance the characters give to freedom, citing the scene where Taloche becomes concerned that water is being [...] "held against its will" [...] in the taps, and [...] "releases" [...] it to overflow the sink onto the bathroom floor, and then the stairs, with Taloche blissfully sliding down the stairs as if he were on a Disney ride. Alexis Campion at Le Journal du Dimanche remarked that Gatlif has refreshingly portrayed the Romani as [...] "free-spirited" [...] characters and added that this historic film is a tribute to those free souls who take to the streets even today. The Télérama review was of the opinion that the movie runs out of steam during the scenes depicting historic events, but gains momentum in the forests and on the roads, where its characters' passion for freedom, and hence Lavoine's and <b>Croze's</b> characters, get sidelined by that of Thierrée's, with his St. Vitus' dance and Dostoyevsky-like ruminations. It added that Taloche is the true [...] "incarnation" [...] of freedom.|$|R
