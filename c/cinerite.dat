40|$|The Island of San Pietro, {{situated}} on the SW coast of Sardinia, covers an area of roughly 51 square kilometres. Geologically, the island is composed almost entirely of volcanic rock, with minor outcrops of Tyrrhenian fossil-bearing sandy conglomerates, of eolian sandstones, ancient and recent alluvial deposits, dunal sands and sediments deposited in palustrine and marshy environments. In spite of its small size, the island boasts a wealth of geodiversity, with the occurrence {{of a variety of}} effusive magmatic rocks formed during the Oligo-Miocene volcanic cycle that affected the whole of Sardinia. During this cycle numerous units were emplaced as well as various, easily distinguishable types of volcanic rocks, namely lava (rhyolite, rhyolitic ignimbrite, comendite, retinite, diaspore, etc.) and tuff (tuff, pyroclastite, <b>cinerite,</b> pumiceous <b>cinerite,</b> red and yellow ochre), sometimes with spectacular domes (for instance at Capo Sandalo and Cala Fico) manganese bearing mineralizations, emission centres, lava flow surface structures (comendite lava at Bricco di Nasca and Montagna di Ravenna), convolute flow structures (comendite lava at Cala Fico) and spectacular columnar fracturing. Detailed field surveys and laboratory investigations conducted using aerial photographs, orthophotographs and satellite images allowed to examine and classify those landforms attributable to geomorphological processes associated with water, weathering, wind and coastal dynamics. The marine environment was geologically-geomorphologically interpreted chiefly by examining the Side Scan Sonar data, supplemented with direct observations during underwater surveys. For the pericoastal areas (between 0 and - 15 m), photograms and recently acquired satellite imagery were analysed. Side scan sonograms together with direct underwater observations were used to determine lithology of submerged rock outcrops, to reconstruct boundaries between different rock types, to detect evidence of tectonic lines, to determine the evolution of coastal and underwater relief forms, to identify the main sedimentary facies and evidence of sea level stand (palaeo shore line). Interpretive hypothesis of the side scan sonar data were validated by means of underwater surveys. Data from land and sea surveys were interpreted in CAD and GIS environments...|$|E
40|$|Zeolites {{from the}} most {{important}} volcanoclastic deposits of Italy include: (1) phillipsite and heulandite from the <b>cinerite</b> of the central northern Apennines; (2) chabazite and phillipsite from phonolitic tephritic ignimbrites contg. black pumices; (3) phillipsite from the tufo lionato of Vulcano Laziale; (4) chabazite and phillipsite from the Campanian ignimbrite; (5) phillipsite from the Neapolitan yellow tuff; and (6) chabazite and phillipsite from the pyroclastics of Monte Vulture. Compared with sedimentary phillipsites and chabazites described in the literature, the chabazites and phillipsites studied have lower Si/Al ratios and higher K contents. These chem. peculiarities are correlated with both the K-rich vesuvianitic-leucititic, latitic-phonolitic, and potassic alkali-trachytic chem. of the ash from which they were derived and, very likely, with {{the character of the}} hydrol. open system environment in which they formed. The zeolites of the heulandite-clinoptilolite group from the cinerites of the central northern Apennines is classified as a true heulandite {{on the basis of its}} chem. compn. and thermal behavior...|$|E
40|$|I used {{theoretical}} forward {{models to}} show that a cavity embedded in a stratified sedimentary sequence can induce an equivalence problem in the ERT data inversion. Conductive top soil increases the misfit between the ground feature and the ERT model. The misfit depends on array and stratigraphy sequences. The latter induce an equivalence problem that manifests itself as wrong cavity depth positioning. The misfit is greater in the data acquired with Schlumberger array than with dipole-dipole. The ambiguity of ERT data inversion problems was tested in the detection of cavities linked to an 8 th- 6 th century B. C. Sabine tomb, 3 m wide x 3 m long x 2 m high, excavated from a shaly gray volcanic ash (<b>cinerite)</b> layer covered by semi-lithoid tuff and top soil layers. In the real study I reduced the ambiguity in the inverse problem of ERT data using a priori information on geometry and resistivity of the cavity. The constrains were carried out from georadar data acquired with 80 and 200 MHz antenna. I demonstrate that this procedure has a practical application in cavity detection, and is a key to the reduction of the uncertainty inherent in the inversion process of ERT data. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.

5000|$|The stone tool {{industry}} of local raw {{materials from the}} alluvial formations of the Neste river, such as quartzites, lydites, <b>cinerites,</b> and schists {{is considered to be}} of a mediocre quality. Flint, as found in the cultural sediments is naturally absent in the immediate environment and must have been imported from several sources. The most exploited flint quarry is the Montagaillard flysch, located 40 km away in the Hibarette community of the Montgaillard region. This ﬂysch ﬂint is of good quality and is found in slabs of different sizes. The presence of Lepidorbitoid fossils in some flints indicates even more distant sources located in the Béarn province, more than 100 km away. Apparently, the ﬂint outcrops of the Petites Pyrénées to the northeast were not used ...|$|R

Tite oldest cycle, witich is developed for a maximum of 15 m only, is tite Lu Caparoni Fm., rich in tite lower part of Autunian planté. Titis Unit begins with alluvial and lacustrine sedimenté, aboye which we find some explosive products, which have been interpreted as kaolinized <b>cinerites.</b> Subsequently, titis volcano-tectunie activity generated coarser-grained fluvio-deltaic deposits. l-Iowever, titin clastie intercalations persisted wititin titese massive deposité, again in tite presence of tuffaceous material.

40|$|We use {{a marine}} seismic dataset {{to examine the}} {{reflections}} from two gas sands, a lignitic sand and a cineritic bed, by means of their amplitude versus offset (AVO) responses. This offset-dependent signature is related to specific petrophysical and thus elastic situations or to peculiar interference patterns and may help to distinguish {{the nature of the}} amplitude anomalies on the stack sections. The prestack analysis is carried out on seismic data which have undergone an accurate true-amplitude processing. It is found that the lignitic-sand reflections exhibit a decreasing AVO while the two-gas sands show markedly increasing AVO trends. Also the reflections from the cineritic layer show increasing amplitudes with offset that may be due either to the petrophysical nature of the <b>cinerites</b> or to thin-layer interference or to both. In order to verify the reliability of the actual AVO responses we develop a detailed model from well data and compute a synthetic CMP seismogram. In order to account for mode conversions and thin-layer effects, the synthetic seismograms are computed using the reflectivity method. The wavelets used in the synthetics are retrieved from actual seismic and borehole data by means of wavelet processing. When finely layered structures are present, the estimation of a reliable wavelet is extremely important to get the correct synthetic AVO response. In particular, the AVO responses of the cineritic layer differ substantially if we make use in the computation of the synthetics of a Ricker wavelet or of a wavelet estimated through wavelet processing. The good match between the observed and modelled data confirms the reliability of the processing sequence and of the final AVO signatures...|$|R
