500|$|The Japanese {{perception}} is remarkably different; Satō and Kabosu are rather {{known as a}} pet and owner rather than a meme, and her blog is the fourth-most popular pet-related blog in the country as of December 2013. Reacting to the meme, she explained, [...] "To be honest, some pictures are strange for me, but it's still funny! I’m very impressed with their skills and taste. Around me, nobody knows about the doge meme. Maybe I don't understand memes very well, because I'm living a such an analog life." [...] Satō has also expressed that she had learned that [...] "the risk of the internet is that {{anyone in the world}} <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> life on my blog". Fleming stated that in his experience, the Shiba Inu breed has become more recognised due to the meme.|$|E

That's who I am. You <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> soul." [...] In an interview with Vibe Beyoncé recalled the video, [...] "I didn't have any hair and makeup. [...] just me {{on the beach and}} in the sun, and I brought one bathing suit 'cause I was there for myself. It's very artistic and grimy, and [...] no retouching. It is what it is." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Russian Roulette" [...] {{begins with}} a [...] "searing" [...] guitar solo that later {{transitions}} into a [...] "pulsing" [...] beat which stays constant {{until the end of}} the song. The single opens with the lyrics, [...] "Take a breath/ Take it deep/ Calm yourself/ He says to me/ If you play/ You play for keeps/ Take the gun/ And count to three." [...] The metaphor about the game of Russian roulette is also present in the chorus in which Rihanna sings, [...] "And you <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> heart beating/ You can see it through my chest/ I said I'm terrified, but I'm not leaving/ I know that I must pass this test/ So just pull the trigger." [...] In the upcoming verse, the character that the singer portrays in the song it's scared that the man talking to her will always have a power over, [...] "Say a prayer to yourself/ He says close your eyes/ Sometimes it helps/ And then I get a scary thought/ That he's here means he's never lost." [...] "Russian Roulette" [...] ends with a sound of a gun shot, which according to Michaelangelo Matos of The A.V. Club extends the drama accompanied by [...] "harrowing scenarios and tremulous vocals".|$|E
