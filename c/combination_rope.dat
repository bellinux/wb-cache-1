500|$|A {{challenge}} course {{opened in}} Prescott Park in April 2012, {{operated by the}} Tigard-based company Synergo. The course has 15 elements—eight low and seven high—each formed by various <b>combinations</b> of <b>ropes,</b> wires, platforms, ladders, and swings. They range from [...] above the ground.|$|R
40|$|Tensile and {{extension}} properties of standard Cift-CWR and imported <b>combination</b> wire <b>ropes</b> from Japan, Norway and Denmark are studied and {{the analysis is}} presented in the paper. Tensile and chemical properties of steel wire, tensile and abrasive properties of PP covering, effect of twist on material at different stages are worked out and reported...|$|R
60|$|Each {{stone of}} this {{building}} was treated with as much care and solicitude {{as if it were}} a living creature. After being carefully cut and curiously formed, and conveyed to the neighbourhood of the rock, it was hoisted out of the hold and laid on the vessel's deck, when it was handed over to the landing-master, whose duty it became to transfer it, by means of a <b>combination</b> of <b>ropes</b> and blocks, to the deck of the praam boat, and then deliver it at the rock.|$|R
40|$|Jute rope {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{materials}} used for composites in various industries and in civil engineering. This experimental study investigated two types of jute rope with different diameters for jute rope composite plates to determine the best <b>combination</b> of jute <b>rope</b> and carbon fiber in terms of ratio and physical and mechanical properties. Eight combinations of carbon fiber and jute rope with different percentages of carbon fiber were analyzed. Tensile tests for the jute rope composite plate and hybrid jute rope composite were conducted, and the mechanical and physical properties of the specimens were compared. Thereafter, the ideal <b>combinations</b> of jute <b>rope</b> with an optimum percentage of carbon fiber were identified and recommended. These particular combinations had tensile strengths that were 2. 23 times and 1. 76 times higher than other varieties in each type...|$|R
50|$|Hydraulic {{elevators}} use {{the principles}} of hydraulics (in the sense of hydraulic power) to pressurize an above ground or in-ground piston to raise and lower the car (see Hydraulic elevators below). Roped hydraulics use a <b>combination</b> of both <b>ropes</b> and hydraulic power to raise and lower cars. Recent innovations include permanent magnet motors, machine room-less rail mounted gearless machines, and microprocessor controls.|$|R
50|$|Katrín missed {{qualification}} in 2014 due to {{a relatively}} poor performance at the Europe Regional on Event 5, a <b>combination</b> of legless <b>rope</b> climbs and sprints. Katrín {{finished in the top}} 10 on every 2014 Regional Event except this one, in which she dropped to 24th. In the end, 9 points separated Katrín from the final 2014 Games qualifier out of the Europe Regional, third-ranked Norwegian athlete Kristin Holte.|$|R
500|$|Since {{at least}} the thirteenth century, the {{mountain}} has been {{regarded as one of}} the Seven Wonders of Dauphiné. The mountain is most noted for its first ascent in 1492. Charles VIII ordered that the peak be climbed, so one of his servants, Antoine de Ville, made the ascent using a <b>combination</b> of ladders, <b>ropes</b> and other artificial aids. He was visited in the following days by many local members of the nobility and aristocracy. The team bivouacked on the summit for eight days, erecting small crosses and a stone shelter. [...] The ascent is described by François Rabelais in his Quart Livre. This was the first recorded climb of any technical difficulty, and has been said to mark the beginning of mountaineering.|$|R
50|$|What began {{merely as}} an undercard world title fight in a {{pay-per-view}} program featuring Félix Trinidad vs Oba Carr and Julio César Chávez vs Tony Lopez, {{soon became a}} fight {{that is part of}} boxing's lore. Castro was trailing badly on all three scorecards, with one eye closed and the other one only halfway opened, bleeding and taking combination after <b>combination</b> against the <b>ropes.</b> Seemingly {{on the verge of being}} stopped, Castro landed a left hook to Jackson's chin and Jackson hit the floor. Jackson got up, but he suffered two more knockdowns and Castro completed what could be said that was one of the greatest turnarounds ever in a boxing fight, retaining the title by a knockout in the ninth round.|$|R
5000|$|Reviews of {{the film}} were {{overwhelming}} positive, although the film did come under some criticism around accusations of [...] "faking" [...] footage, most notably by New York Times reviewer Bosley Crowther who questioned the authenticity of two {{of the film}}'s more dramatic scenes. Crowther stated in his 1964 review, [...] "Oceanographers consulted here yesterday said it was highly unlikely that a deep-sea cavern, containing a [...] "bubble," [...] or pocket of air, at its top, could exist. If it did, the atmosphere in that bubble would surely be noxious, they said. It would be methane or marsh gas. And the pressure in it would be intolerable for man." [...] The confusion came from Crowther's assertion that the footage was filmed at great depth, an issue not clearly addressed in the film. His other complaint was a long tracking shot moving out from the window of one of the underwater structures, which Crowther claimed could only have been produced in an aquarium. Cousteau later demonstrated how he and his son Philippe produced the shot with a <b>combination</b> of <b>ropes</b> and small underwater motorized vehicles. Cousteau took great offense, and continued to describe and defend the difficult and innovative techniques used to create the film.|$|R
40|$|Harbour is {{a region}} where ships are moored in a {{relatively}} calm environment, {{but it is a}} region with dense ship traffic. Present study deals with analysis of forces and moment on a moored ship induced by a ship passing-by. The elasticity of a mooring rope depends on the material, construction, length and diameter of the rope. Fibre ropes are more elastic than steel ones. The effect of these factors of mooring system on drift motions of the moored ship are presented here for different <b>combinations</b> of mooring <b>rope</b> materials and lengths for a selected vessel combination and operating condition with the breaking strength requirement keeping constant. The mooring system used is a linear one and the coupling between modes of motion of the moored ship is neglected...|$|R
50|$|In 1995, {{after taking}} revenge on Jason DeLucia by {{defeating}} him via submission, Funaki was pitted against Frank Shamrock, Ken's adoptive brother and next rising {{star of the}} company. Funaki again showed his new found affinity for working from the bottom, fending Frank off from his guard and catching him in a triangle choke/kimura <b>combination</b> for a <b>rope</b> escape, before finishing him with a toehold. Funaki's next match would be an upset loss to former Shooto fighter Manabu Yamada, in which Yamada flipped over a mount and caught Funaki in a heel hook for the finish. Funaki bounced back against Pancrase rookie Guy Mezger in a back and forth match, which saw Mezger dominating the action with kicks, strikes and pressure until Funaki clamped an achilles lock to get the win. Funaki's last high level bout in 1995 would be a rematch with Frank Shamrock. Funaki mocked Frank, keeping his hands low and even throwing a flying spinning heel kick in an instance, but he {{was caught in a}} choke and forced to spend a rope escape before returning the favor with a triangle armbar. Funaki got the advantage in points with a rolling toehold, but he then was shockingly forced to tap out in a leglock exchange, losing the match.|$|R
5000|$|According to Roman legend, the {{mountain}} was torn {{from the rest}} of the Vercors when a hunter named Ibicus saw naked goddesses on {{the mountain}} and was changed into an ibex as punishment. In the medieval period, Mont Aiguille was traditionally called [...] "Mount Inaccessible", and typically depicted as an [...] "inverted pyramid" [...] or [...] "mushroom".Since at least the thirteenth century, the mountain has been regarded as one of the Seven Wonders of Dauphiné. The mountain is most noted for its first ascent in 1492. Charles VIII ordered that the peak be climbed, so one of his servants, Antoine de Ville, made the ascent using a <b>combination</b> of ladders, <b>ropes</b> and other artificial aids. He was visited in the following days by many local members of the nobility and aristocracy. The team bivouacked on the summit for eight days, erecting small crosses and a stone shelter. The ascent is described by François Rabelais in his Quart Livre. This was the first recorded climb of any technical difficulty, and has been said to mark the beginning of mountaineering. The mountain was not climbed again until 1834, nearly 350 years later, when it was ascended barefoot by Jean Liotard, accompanied for one-quarter of the way by local explorers. Less than a month later, it was climbed by seven people at the same time, who reportedly danced and sang La Marseillaise on the summit.In 1940, the top 11 m of the mountain collapsed, reducing the height to 2085 m. Seventeen years later, on 27 August 1957, the stunt pilot Henri Giraud landed a Piper J-3 Cub on the summit, utilising an 80 m-long, 20 m-wide runway which had been built earlier that day using materials and men lifted to the summit by helicopters. In the following 18 years, he staged a further 51 landings on the summit before his final landing in 1975, many carrying paying passengers, and often made using skis. The mountain was in 1970 designated as part of the Parc naturel régional du Vercors.|$|R
