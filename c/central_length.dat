6000|$|After {{this much}} for geography, we may view the monarch of Midianite {{mountains}} in the beauty and the majesty of his picturesque form. Seen from El-Muwaylah, he is equally magnificent in the flush of morning, in the still of noon, and in the evening glow. As the rays, which suggested the obelisk, are shooting over the southern crests, leaving the basement blue with a tint between the amethyst and the lapis lazuli, its northern third lies wrapped in a cloak of cold azure grey, and its <b>central</b> <b>length</b> already dons a half-light of warmer hue. Meanwhile, the side next the sun is flooded with an aerial aureole of subtle mist, a drift of liquid gold, a gush of living light, rippling from the unrisen orb, decreasing in warmth and brilliancy, paling and fading and waxing faint with infinite gradations proportioned to the increase of distance. Again, after the clear brooding sheen of day has set off the [...] "stark strength and grandeur of rock-form contrasted with the brilliancy and sprightliness of sea," [...] the sinking sun paints the scene with the most gorgeous of blazonings. The colours of the pale rock-skeleton are so faint {{that there is nothing}} to interfere with the perfect development of atmospheric effects: it is a white sheet spread to catch the grand illumination, lambent lights of saffron and peach-blossom and shades of purple and hyacinth. As indescribably lovely is the after-glow, the zodiacal light which may have originated the pyramid; the lively pink reflection from the upper atmosphere; the vast variety of tints with which the greens and the reds, the purples and the fiery crimsons of the western sky tincture the receptive surface of the neutral-hued granites; and the chameleon-shiftings of the dying day, as it sinks into the arms of night. Nor less admirable are the feats of the fairy Refraction. The mighty curtain seems to rise and fall as if by magic: it imitates, as it were, the framework of man. In early morning the dancing of the air adds many a hundred cubits to its apparent stature: it is now a giant, when at midnight, after the equipoise of atmospheric currents, it becomes a dwarf replica of its former self.|$|E

50|$|To fully {{specify a}} belt, the material, length, and {{cross-section}} {{size and shape}} are required.

When adding to the length of either side, the length of the belt increases, in a similar manner to the Pythagorean theorem. One important concept to remember is that as D1 gets closer to D2 there is less of a distance (and therefore less addition of length) until its approaches zero.|$|E

50|$|The project's centrepiece is the 1.7 km {{piggyback}} tunnel {{under one}} of Australia's most densely populated urban areas, necessitated due to the requirement of three lanes in each direction within the existing roadway corridor. The unique double-deck, three lanes per direction design comprises a large, single tunnel excavation. At mid-height through the excavation, a precast concrete ledge forms {{the base of the}} northbound tunnel, with the southbound tunnel slotting below. As a result, only one tunnel roof was created with the lower southbound carriageway built in a slot.

The calibration technique of optical interferometry can directly link gauge block <b>central</b> <b>length</b> to the distance light travels in vacuum in 1 / 299792458 of a second, the definition of the International System of Units (SI) of length, the metre [1].

Even though these two calibrations involve the same artifact, dominant components in the evaluations of measurement uncertainty for these two techniques are fundamentally different. This {{is due to the fact}} that the method of calibration for interferometry involves measuring light waves in air and absolute gauge block temperature, whereas mechanical comparison involves tactile probing and the important temperature measurement is actually the temperature difference between reference standard and client gauge blocks.

Both the outflow and inflow holes were electrically insulated from the external physiological salt solutions bathing the central 15 mm length of the axon by external flowing dextrose guards. The axial wire was used to pass current to external guard and current measuring electrodes either to excite the axon electrically to produce membrane responses or to control the membrane voltage in the voltage clamp. A glass micropipette electrode (3 M KC 1 bridge to a calomel half-cell) was inserted just through the membrane for potential recording with respect to an external Ag, AgCl reference electrode.

40|$|Irregular {{structures}} have a more-complex {{behavior that}} it is not always considered during their analysis and design. In some design codes, irregular condition is assumed by means of factors that modified the response of simple systems to define the final transversal sections. Although some elastic analyses were developed, they do not always evaluate the effect of different irregular conditions in the dynamic response of bridges. In this work, irregular bridges were analyzed to define the influence of irregular conditions in the variation of dynamic properties, as frequencies and modal forms. For a regular bridge condition, a structure with three single piers by bent of the same size and four spans with equal dimensions were considered. To define irregular bridges, systems with superstructure and substructure irregular conditions were characterized: the first by means of structures with variations in the length of extreme spans, in comparison to the <b>central</b> <b>length</b> spans, in relations of 1 : 0. 25, 1 : 0. 50, 1 : 0. 75, 1 : 1. 25, 1 : 1. 50, 1 : 1. 75, 1 : 2; and for curved structures, with curved angles of 30 ° to 180 °, every 30 °. Substructure bridges were considered by changes in the length of central piers, in relation of extreme elements, in relations of ± 0. 25, 0. 50 and 0. 75. For regular and irregular structures, elastic dynamic properties and its variations were registered. Responses show that modal shapes are different when the central pier length is modified that when the extreme pier length is different. Results also indicate that as the length of the extreme spans or the angle of curvature of the bridges change, the modal forms and periods become more complex.

40|$|In {{the simple}} plastic theory {{commonly}} used for mild steel {{it is assumed}} that after yielding has occurred in either tension or compression, straining can continue indefinitely at constant stress. Such au assumption has been found satisfactory for low carbon steels having a plastic range corresponding to eight to ten times the strain a t yield, but for steels of greater strength th is range is often considerably shorter, and it becomes necessary {{to take into account the}} strain-hardening range beyond. To obtain experimental data, four steels were selected, varying in carbon content from 0. 28 to 0. 89 per cent, and having widely different stress-strain relations. For each steel a number of simply supported beams of square section were subjected to a symmetrical two-point loading; tension specimens were prepared from the unyielded ends of these beams and tested in a spring-loaded autographic testing machine to determine upper and lower yield stresses. In addition, two tension specimens from each steel were tested in a lever type of machine, and the strt%ss-strain relations through the plastic range and the initial stages of the strain-hardening range were obtained with the aid of a “Gerard ” extensometer. This information gave good support to the theoretical work, whereby the behaviour of these steels in flexure can be correlated with the tensile properties.

The diameter of the segment of the fiber in the disk was measured and then the segment was pressed from opposite sides by two insulating wedges. Electrical current was passed transversely through the segment between two platinum-platinum black electrodes that were located in the pools of Ringer's solution within the disk. The results were corrected for stray parallel capacitance, series resistance of the Ringer's solution between the fiber and the electrodes, parallel shunt resistance around the fiber, and the phase shift of the measuring apparatus. A nonlinear least-squares routine was used to fit a lumped equivalent circuit to the data from six fibers. The equivalent circuit that was chosen for the fibers contained three parallel branches; each branch was composed of a resistor and a capacitor in series. The model also included a seventh adjustable parameter that was designed to account for the degree of compression of the fibers by the insulating wedges.
