30|$|Our focus being {{maritime}} connectivity, we take as our {{dependent variable}} exports in goods which are highly <b>containerizable</b> or its natural log {{depending on the}} estimated specification. As mentioned previously the volume of trade transported via sea represents about 80 % of world trade volume. In this study our reference unit is not volume but value. We have that on average the value of trade that can be transported via sea has been increasing steadily from 50 % of total trade in 2006 to more than 56 % in 2013. Pairwise correlation between the series of total exports and exports which are highly <b>containerizable</b> is about 0.93 and is highly significant.|$|E

30|$|The newly {{developed}} LSBCI (Liner Shipping Bilateral Connectivity Index) {{used in this}} paper proves to be a reliable indicator of maritime connectivity as far as trade in <b>containerizable</b> goods is concerned. Moreover, {{results suggest that the}} omission of connectivity indicator of that kind could lead to overestimate the impact of bilateral maritime distance.|$|E
30|$|This section {{presents}} {{results obtained}} by estimating an augmented {{version of the}} standard gravity model of bilateral exports that includes the LSBCI or its components. Even though {{we may not be}} able to talk clearly in causation terms our estimates provide a credible and unique assessment of the association between maritime connectivity and bilateral export of <b>containerizable</b> goods. The reference sample contains 138 coastal countries and corresponds to the reference sample used for the elaboration of descriptive statistics presented in previous sections.|$|E
30|$|The rest of {{the paper}} is {{organized}} as follows. Next section presents the data used {{for the construction of}} the LSBCI and the empirical exercise. Components of the proposed LSBCI section discusses the components of the revised version of the LSBCI and presents some descriptive statistics. Stylized facts of the revised LSBCI are commented in The LSBCI section. Empirical analysis section is dedicated to the assessment {{of the impact of the}} revised LSBCI and of its components on bilateral exports of <b>containerizable</b> goods.

30|$|This paper {{builds on}} (Fugazza 2015) and (Hoffmann et al. 2014). It {{contributes}} {{to both the}} literature on maritime connectivity and its definition and on {{the literature on the}} impact of trade costs and their components on trade. Its contribution is twofold. First it presents a revised version of the LSBCI which provides an overall view of maritime connectivity. 1 Second, the impact of the revised LSBCI and of its components on bilateral exports of <b>containerizable</b> goods is assessed using a comprehensive set of country pairs observed for 8  years during the period 2006 – 2013.|$|E

This thesis investigates various techniques for forecasting {{the volume of}} <b>containerizable</b> cargo that flows into the container stuffing station at the Military Ocean Terminal, Bay Area, Oakland, California. Cargo input data is analyzed in terms of weekly cargo volume inputs for a selected number of major ports of debarkation. The time-series data for these ports is first tested for serial correlation. Based on the affirmative results of the serial correlation test, the following forecasting methods are investigated: the moving average, the exponentially weighted average, the exponentially weighted average with trend adjustment and the exponentially weighted average with an adaptive response rate. By means of statistical testing procedures, the "best" forecasting method is determined. [URL] United States Coast Guar...|$|E
30|$|The {{predominance}} of maritime transport {{has increased in}} particular for manufactured goods due to the intensification of containerized transport services. Thanks to containerization and the global liner shipping network, small and large exporters and importers of finished and intermediate <b>containerizable</b> goods from far away countries can trade with each-other, even if their individual trade transaction would not economically justify chartering a ship. Thanks to a network of regular container shipping services with transhipment operations in so-called hub ports, basically all countries are today connected to each other. A recent empirical study confirmed the “[e]ffects of the Container Revolution on World Trade” (Bernhofen et al. 2013). As far as North-North trade is concerned the authors found a cumulative (concurrent plus lag effects) average treatment effect of containerization over a 20  year time period amount to 790 %. The cumulative effect of bilateral GATT membership is found to raise trade {{by an average of}} 285 %, which is less than half the cumulative effect of full containerization.|$|E
40|$|The chapter {{provides}} {{empirical evidence}} that indicators for different port characteristics have {{a statistically significant}} and strong impact on international maritime transport costs. It reports on empirical work on trade among 16 Latin-American countries. The database incorporates 75, 928 observations, which comprise practically all maritime trade transactions in <b>containerizable</b> goods on most intra-Latin-American trade routes for the year 2002. The regressions incorporate the main classical explanatory variables of maritime transport costs, such as unit cargo value, volume per transaction, geographical distance, bilateral trade volume, and trade balances. It further looks at six indicators for different port characteristics as possible additional determinants of international transport costs. It is found that indicators for port efficiency, port infrastructure, private sector participation, and inter-port connectivity have significant impacts on international maritime transport costs. The estimated elasticity for port efficiency is the highest of all port-related variables; doubling port efficiency {{in a pair of}} ports has the same impact on international transport costs as halving the distance between them would have. ...|$|E
30|$|Transport {{connectivity}} is {{a crucial}} determinant of bilateral exports. This paper presents an empirical assessment {{of the relationship between}} bilateral maritime liner shipping connectivity and exports in <b>containerizable</b> goods during the period 2006 – 2013. Making use of probed “gravity” type trade models, the paper incorporates new data on different measurements of maritime distance, as well as a unique new dataset and new bilateral connectivity indices developed by UNCTAD. The empirical investigations unequivocally show that lacking a direct maritime connection with a trade partner is associated with lower values of exports; any additional transshipment is associated with a 40 % lower value of bilateral exports. Other indicators of liner shipping connectivity incorporated in the research take into consideration levels of competition and container vessel sizes. Results also indicate that the quality of bilateral connectivity as measured by several composite indices {{is a crucial}} determinant of bilateral exports. All empirical results suggest that {{in the absence of a}} bilateral connectivity indicator the impact of distance on bilateral exports in classical gravity models is likely to be overestimated.|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of containerization triggered complementary technological and organizational changes that revolutionized global freight transport. Despite numerous {{claims about the}} importance of containerization in stimulating international trade, econometric estimates on the effects of containerization on trade appear to be missing. Our paper fills this gap in the literature. Our key idea is to exploit time and cross-sectional variation in countries' adoption of port or railway container facilities to construct a time-varying bilateral technology variable and estimate its effect on explaining variations in bilateral product level trade flows in a large panel for the period 1962 - 1990. Our estimates suggest that containerization did not only stimulate trade in <b>containerizable</b> products (like auto parts) but also had complementary effects on non-containerizables (like automobiles). As expected, we find larger effects on North-North trade than on North-South or South-South trade and much smaller effects when ignoring railway containerization. Regarding North-North trade, the cumulative average treatment effects of containerization over a 20 year time period amount to about 700 %, can be interpreted as causal, and are much larger than the effects of free trade agreements or the GATT. In a nutshell, we provide the first econometric evidence for containerization to be a driver of 20 th century economic globalization...|$|E
40|$|International {{shipping}} {{is a vital}} channel {{linking the}} world economy, particularly {{from the perspective of}} international commodity trade. The recently proposed carbon regulation in international shipping will not only affect the competitiveness of shipping lines, but will also have implications for the global economy. This paper adopts an energy-environmental version of the Global Trade Analysis Project referred to as GTAP-E to analyze the quantitative effects of a maritime carbon tax on the global economy by placing a special focus on <b>containerizable</b> commodities given their significant role in international trade. The major advantage of the GTAP-E model is that it can capture the effects of asymmetric changes in freight costs on different routes caused by the maritime carbon tax. Based on our numerical results, imposing a maritime carbon tax on international container shipping will not lead to a significant economic impact unless the tax level is high. China will suffer the greatest real GDP loss among all countries. Under a high level of global maritime carbon tax ($ 90 /tCO 2), the real GDP loss to China will be around 0. 02 %. The negative economic impacts on the European countries will be greater if a maritime carbon tax is imposed only on the European container exporting/importing routes, compared to the situation where a global maritime carbon tax is imposed on container shipping. Finally, the imposition of a maritime carbon tax will discourage distant container trade on the routes (origin-destination) "China-USA", "Rest of Asia-USA", and "South America-China"...|$|E
