40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} the reserve price on participation and the degree of competition in competitive tenderingfor public contracts. Our approach aims at reconciling the most recent developments in auction theory with the more practicalissues arising in centralized public procurement. In lowest price competitive tendering, we argue that, by lowering the reserve price, a (national) <b>central</b> <b>purchasing</b> <b>body</b> may reduce the purchasing cost at the expense of participation. Instead, if the contract is awarded by means of a scoring auction, the objectives of participation and cost reduction do not necessarily conflict with each other. reserve price; public contracts; central purchasing body; scoring auctions...|$|E
40|$|Consip is {{a public}} company owned by the Italian Ministry of Finance. It {{operates}} as Italy's <b>central</b> <b>purchasing</b> <b>body,</b> and implements the programme for the rationalisation of public spending on goods and services {{through the use of}} ICT (Information and Communication Technology) and innovative procurement tools, such as framework contracts, e-marketplace for public administration, and a dynamic purchasing system. Italy's National Action Plan (NAP) on green public procurement (GPP) entered into force in 2008 and, since then, GPP {{has been one of the}} pillars of Consip's Rationalisation Programme. Consip's mission is to make the use of public resources more efficient and transparent, by providing tools and support to public administrations which enable them to carry out procurement procedures which foster competitive participation from enterprises. The objectives were to tender for a framework contract for print and copy management services for use by the entire Italian public sector. Consip's aim was to move away from single user printers and copiers which lead to a great deal of printing and thus higher costs. A mechanism called Click & Save (please note that this is not a brand name) was sought through the procurement, as it is a means for rewarding less printing. The framework contract also covered an optional service to manage leased office equipment (printers, photocopiers and fax machines). During the pre-procurement phase, a number of interviews were carried out with potential suppliers to discuss Energy Star requirements, design for disassembly and noise requirements...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the suppliers’ view of their relation to Stora Enso. The study focuses on the relation between the <b>central</b> <b>purchasing</b> unit of Stora Enso and the suppliers but also gives indications of how the overall interface between Stora Enso and the suppliers works. The purpose is explored through a number of research objectives, which are presented below. Areas essential for the functioning of the <b>central</b> <b>purchasing</b> unit: - The overall organisation of Stora Enso’s purchasing activities, - Stora Enso’s cross-functional purchasing teams, - The internal coordination and communication, - The relational bonds between Stora Enso and the suppliers Important goals and visions for the <b>central</b> <b>purchasing</b> unit: - Minimising the Total Business Cost, - Being an attractive partner to the suppliers Currently discussed issues within the <b>central</b> <b>purchasing</b> organisation: - The potential for closer cooperation between Stora Enso and the suppliers, - The professionalism of Stora Enso’s purchasers Stora Enso is well organised for purchasing but the centrally coordinated cross-functional teams are not working as well as they could. The internal coordination has improved lately but the <b>central</b> <b>purchasing</b> unit’s mission to optimise for Stora Enso as a whole often creates tension within the organisation, as a result of the mills being profit centres. The internal communication is not efficient, and the suppliers are strengthening their bonds with the mills by taking over the responsibility for certain information flows. The <b>central</b> <b>purchasing</b> unit and the cross-functional teams have the responsibility but not the authority to carry out their task of identifying and reducing the Total Business Cost. Stora Enso is an attractive customer for their suppliers, mainly because of the big volumes they represent. The current negotiation strategies are not advantageous for the introduction of collaborative supplier relations but other factors in the relation between the suppliers and Stora Enso speak strongly in favour for such a strategic change. When it comes to professionalism and business moral the suppliers give the <b>central</b> <b>purchasing</b> unit a very positive evaluation...|$|R
