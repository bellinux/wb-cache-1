40|$|This {{report on}} stage 2 of the {{national}} core maternity indicators project describes the development of 8 indicators, including scoping and assessment of existing data items for reporting. Summary This report builds on previous work undertaken by the AIHW for the Maternity Services Inter-Jurisdictional Committee (MSIJC) of the Australian Health Ministers 2 ̆ 7 Advisory Council (AHMAC) {{on the development of}} a set of National Core Maternity Indicators (NCMIs) to monitor the quality of maternity care in Australia. This report represents the second stage of the project, which was undertaken by the AIHW during 2012 - 13. It involved exploring the validity and feasibility of a possible 8 additional NCMIs {{to be added to the}} current set of 10 NCMIs. Clinical advice and input was provided by an Expert Commentary Group (ECG). In consultation with key stakeholders and experts, definitions and technical specifications were developed for the 8 additional NCMIs, and existing and potential data sources for reporting were investigated. Recommendations for next steps were then made for each proposed NCMI. The 8 potential additional indicators developed and investigated were: 	High risk women undergoing caesarean section who receive appropriate pharmacological thromboprophylaxis (Indicator 11) 	Babies born at or after 37 completed weeks gestation admitted to a neonatal intensive care nursery or special care nursery for reasons other than congenital anomaly (Indicator 12) 	Third and fourth degree tears for (a) all first births and (b) all births (Indicator 13) 	Blood loss of (i) greater than 1, 000 mL and less than 1, 500 mL, and (ii) 1, 500 mL or more during first 24 hours after the birth of the baby (that is, major primary postpartum haemorrhage) for (a) vaginal births and (b) caesarean sections (Indicator 14) 	Women having their second birth vaginally whose first birth was by caesarean section (Indicator 15) 	Separation of baby from the mother after birth for additional care (Indicator 16) 	One-to-one care in labour (Indicator 17) 	Caesarean sections at less than 39 completed weeks gestation (273 days) without obstetric/medical indication (Indicator 18). During consideration of Indicator 16, the ECG proposed an additional new indicator for further investigation, 2 ̆ 7 Skin-to-skin contact between mother and baby after birth 2 ̆ 7. Recommendations 	Indicators 13, 15 and 18 should be added to the current set of 10 NCMIs for reporting using the National Perinatal Data <b>Collection.</b> 	<b>Indicator</b> 14 to be: aligned with items on postpartum haemorrhage in the 2014 - 15 Perinatal Data Set Specification (lower limit now to include 1, 000 mL blood loss and be reflected in the Indicator title); and added to the current set of 10 NCMIs for reporting. 	Indicator 12 and the ECG-suggested indicator 2 ̆ 7 Skin-to-skin contact between mother and baby after birth 2 ̆ 7 require further data development, and this development should be undertaken to enable future reporting against these 2 indicators. 	Indicators 11, 16 and 17 should not be further developed or added to the current set of NCMIs at this stage...|$|E

40|$|Ever {{since the}} Brundtland Commission {{presented}} its report on sustainable development in 1987, various institutions have either adopted {{or tried to}} refine the approach used in the report. Currently, there is a broad collection of concepts that are often highly related to sustainable development. These concepts do not seldom include aspects like poverty and development, security issues and quality of life. The operationalization of these concepts {{has resulted in a}} broad <b>collection</b> of <b>indicators</b> and composites of indicators, the so-called indexes. Important examples of successful operationalization are the Human Development Index and the Millennium Development Goals. Most of these <b>collections</b> of <b>indicators</b> have no, or hardly any, theoretical foundation. Furthermore, the precise description of the underlying process that these indicators try to indicate is lacking and the availability of data seems to be the guideline for selection. Selection of indicators should be based on a list of criteria such as sensitivity to changes, transparency and redundancy. Applying the Pressure-State-Impact-Response mechanism can improve the selection and use of indicators since causal relationships are distinguished and underlying processes interlinked. Further refinement can be obtained by the use of a hierarchical representation, resulting in a transparent and traceable indicator framework. Maslow's theory of needs connects these aspects with the human/social sustainability domain. Applying this theory to the selection of indicators results in a well-founded, but still practical, <b>collection</b> of <b>indicators</b> for possible use in further depiction of social and human aspects of sustainable development...|$|R

A second subset is the <b>collection</b> of <b>indicators</b> that measure human activities or anthropogenic pressures, such as greenhouse gas emissions.

40|$|AbstractThe COST Action TU 1103 “Operation {{and safety}} of tramways in {{interaction}} with public space” aimed at contributing to improve tramway safety through improving the management of data collection and the design of their insertion into urban space. The action has shown that across all the countries involved exists a great diversity of tramway systems and safety management mechanisms. Despite this diversity, {{we have been able}} to reach some conclusions about the nature of safety issues, the need for relevant information and the operator's essential role. This has enabled us to lay out some practical recommendations on accident data <b>collection,</b> <b>indicators</b> and their analysis. We have also observed a great variety regarding the urban insertion of tramway systems. Some countries pay special attention to protection, using barriers and fences as the general way of inserting the tramway. Other countries try to get a more integrated system, with an easier coexistence with pedestrians and cyclists in the city centre, but still guaranteeing the capacity and adequate speed of the tram when running through the metropolitan area. In any case, tramway systems deal with safety issues that are very similar in all countries, and the solutions and measures applied in some places can be useful for other networks facing similar problems or implementing a new line.

40|$|Background: For {{health care}} {{performance}} indicators (PIs) to be reliable, data underlying the PIs {{are required to}} be complete, accurate, consistent and reproducible. Given the lack of regulation of the data-systems used in the Netherlands, and the self-report based indicator scores, one would expect heterogeneity {{with respect to the}} data collection and the ways indicators are computed. This might affect the reliability and plausibility of the nationally reported scores. Methods. We aimed to investigate the extent to which local hospital data <b>collection</b> and <b>indicator</b> computation strategies differ and how this affects the plausibility of self-reported indicator scores, using survey results of 42 hospitals and data of the Dutch national quality database. Results: The data <b>collection</b> and <b>indicator</b> computation strategies of the hospitals were substantially heterogenic. Moreover, the Hip and Knee replacement PI scores can be regarded as largely implausible, which was, to a great extent, related to a limited (computerized) data registry. In contrast, Breast Cancer PI scores were more plausible, despite the incomplete data registry and limited data access. This might be explained by the role of the regional cancer centers that collect most of the indicator data for the national cancer registry, in a standardized manner. Hospitals can use cancer registry indicator scores to report to the government, instead of their own locally collected indicator scores. Conclusions: Indicator developers, users and the scientific field need to focus more on the underlying (heterogenic) ways of data collection and conditional data infrastructures. Countries that have a liberal software market and are aiming to implement a self-report based performance indicator system to obtain health care transparency, should secure the accuracy and precision of the heath care data from which the PIs are calculated. Moreover, ongoing research and development of PIs and profound insight in the clinical practice of data registration is warranted...|$|R
