5|$|The {{survival}} {{of a living}} organism depends on the continuous input of energy. Chemical reactions {{that are responsible for}} its structure and function are tuned to extract energy from substances that act as its food and transform them to help form new cells and sustain them. In this process, molecules of chemical substances that constitute food play two roles; first, they contain energy that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>transformed</b> and reused in that organism's biological, chemical reactions; second, food <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>transformed</b> into new molecular structures (biomolecules) that are of use to that organism.|$|E

5|$|A {{closely related}} problem, the minimax path problem, asks for {{the path that}} {{minimizes}} the maximum weight of any of its edges. It has applications that include transportation planning.

5|$|All of the Peano axioms {{except the}} ninth axiom (the {{induction}} axiom) are statements in first-order logic. The arithmetical operations of addition and multiplication {{and the order}} relation can also be defined using first-order axioms. The axiom of induction is in second-order, since it quantifies over predicates (equivalently, sets of natural numbers rather than natural numbers), but it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>transformed</b> into a first-order axiom schema of induction. Such a schema includes one axiom per predicate definable in the first-order language of Peano arithmetic, making it weaker than the second-order axiom.|$|E
5|$|From {{the figure}} 8, {{it is clear}} that an economy {{operating}} at a position where the MRS of either Crusoe or Friday is not equal to the MRT between coconuts and fish cannot be Pareto efficient. This is because the rate at which, say Friday is willing to trade coconuts for fish is different from the rate at which coconuts <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>transformed</b> into fish. Thus, {{there is a way to}} make Friday better off by rearranging the production pattern.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{the term}} duality {{refers to a}} {{situation}} where two seemingly different physical systems {{turn out to be}} equivalent in a nontrivial way. If two theories are related by a duality, it means that one theory <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>transformed</b> in some way so that it ends up looking just like the other theory. The two theories are then said to be dual to one another under the transformation. Put differently, the two theories are mathematically different descriptions of the same phenomena.|$|E
5|$|Methods {{have been}} {{developed}} to purify DNA from organisms, such as phenol-chloroform extraction, and to manipulate it in the laboratory, such as restriction digests and the polymerase chain reaction. Modern biology and biochemistry make intensive use of these techniques in recombinant DNA technology. Recombinant DNA is a man-made DNA sequence that has been assembled from other DNA sequences. They <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>transformed</b> into organisms in the form of plasmids or in the appropriate format, by using a viral vector. The genetically modified organisms produced can be used to produce products such as recombinant proteins, used in medical research, or be grown in agriculture.|$|E

It comprises four stands: the Western Stand; the Eastern Stand and the Southern Stand, {{both of which}} have two tiers; and the Northern Stand, which is terraced. The lower-right part of the Southern Stand also features terracing for away supporters, {{but the rest of the}} stand is seated. The lower tier has 10,000 seats, and the upper tier has 8,000 seats. The Northern Stand has a capacity of 6,000 standing supporters, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>transformed</b> into an all-seated section with a capacity of 3,000 if required.

5|$|The mirror {{symmetry}} {{relationship is}} a particular example of what physicists call a duality. In general, the term duality refers to a situation where two seemingly different physical theories {{turn out to be}} equivalent in a nontrivial way. If one theory <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>transformed</b> so it looks just like another theory, the two are said to be dual under that transformation. Put differently, the two theories are mathematically different descriptions of the same phenomena. Such dualities {{play an important role in}} modern physics, especially in string theory.|$|E
5|$|A {{cover system}} {{can be used in}} combat as {{assistance}} against enemies. Players have the ability to lean around, over, and under cover, which {{can be used as a}} tactical advantage during shootouts and stealth levels. The game gives players a wide variety of weapon options; they can be found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or removed from their stationary position and carried around. Weapon ammunition must be manually retrieved from the ground or from dead enemies. Players have access to a weapon inventory, which allows them to carry as many weapons as they find. With some of these weapons, players have the ability to dual wield, giving them an advantage over enemies by dealing twice as much damage. Players can also customize weapons through the use of upgrades; for example, a rocket launcher can be attached to the side of an assault rifle, and a laser cannon <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>transformed</b> into a wire cutting tool.|$|E
5|$|Adding a {{multiple}} of any row to another row, or {{a multiple}} of any column to another column, {{does not change the}} determinant. Interchanging two rows or two columns affects the determinant by multiplying it by −1. Using these operations, any matrix <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>transformed</b> to a lower (or upper) triangular matrix, and for such matrices the determinant equals the product of the entries on the main diagonal; this provides a method to calculate the determinant of any matrix. Finally, the Laplace expansion expresses the determinant in terms of minors, that is, determinants of smaller matrices. This expansion can be used for a recursive definition of determinants (taking as starting case the determinant of a 1-by-1 matrix, which is its unique entry, or even the determinant of a 0-by-0 matrix, which is 1), that can be seen to be equivalent to the Leibniz formula. Determinants can be used to solve linear systems using Cramer's rule, where the division of the determinants of two related square matrices equates to the value of each of the system's variables.|$|E

Lili survives the attack and is examined by Dr. Garth through hypnosis; she reveals enough information to let Dr. Garth {{know that it was}} Countess Zaleska that attacked her, but suffers heart failure and dies. The Countess gives up fighting her urges and accepts that a cure is not possible; she lures Dr. Garth him to Transylvania by kidnapping Janet (Marguerite Churchill), his secretary, whom he has a playfully antagonistic relationship with, but now realizes that he cares for her. Zaleska intends to transform Dr. Garth into a vampire to be her eternal companion. Arriving at Castle Dracula in Transylvania, Dr. Garth agrees to exchange his life for Janet's. Before he <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>transformed,</b> Countess Zaleska is destroyed when Sandor shoots her through the heart with an arrow as revenge for her breaking her promise to make him immortal.
