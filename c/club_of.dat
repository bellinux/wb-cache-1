5000|$|The {{object of}} each hand {{is to come}} up with the correct {{combination}} of cards to be able to Go Down, or [...] "lay out". The combination for each hand is different (see chart), and they become more difficult with each subsequent hand. The combinations for each hand are either group also called sets or runs or a combination of both. A set is a combination of three or more of a specific number of cards of the same rank, and the suit is not important. An example of a set is three cards that are all 8's, and the 8's can all be of different suits. A run is a combination of four cards in the same suit that have consecutive ranks. An example of a run is the 3 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 4 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 5 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> and the 6 <b>of</b> <b>clubs.</b> As previously stated, an ace can be high or low, but it cannot be in between, a few examples. Ace <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 2 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 3 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> and 4 <b>of</b> <b>clubs</b> is a run, and Jack <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> Queen <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> King <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> Ace <b>of</b> <b>clubs</b> is a run, but King <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> Ace <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 2 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 3 <b>of</b> <b>clubs</b> is not a run. Jokers are wild cards and can be any card in the deck. In hands that require two runs, a player may chose to play the same suit for both runs, however connecting runs must have either a gap, and extra card or nine cards. Examples: Ace <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 2 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 3 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> and 4 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 6 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 7 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 8 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> and 9 <b>of</b> <b>clubs</b> counts as two runs. Ace <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 2 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 3 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> and 4 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 4 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 5 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 6 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> and 7 <b>of</b> <b>clubs</b> counts as two runs, but in order for Ace <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 2 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 3 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 4 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 5 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 6 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> 7 <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> and 8 <b>of</b> <b>clubs</b> to be a run, the player must also have the 9 <b>of</b> <b>clubs</b> (played as part of the higher run).|$|R
