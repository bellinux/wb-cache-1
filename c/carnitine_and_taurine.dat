40|$|ABSTRACT. Ten adult, male, nonambulant and gastrostomy-fed {{individuals}} {{had received}} commercially available enteral feedings containing negligible amounts of selenium, <b>carnitine,</b> <b>and</b> <b>taurine</b> {{for an average}} of 59 months. Blood levels of these three nutrients were below published normal ranges as were the urinary excretions of <b>carnitine</b> <b>and</b> <b>taurine.</b> After 9 weeks on a product that was fortified with 23 &mu;g of selenium, 39 mg of carnitine, and 38 mg of taurine per 8 ounces, blood levels were significantly increased with the levels of selenium and carnitine being normalized. (Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 14 : 270 - 274, 1990) The atypical life style of nonambulant, tube-fed, se-verely handicapped individuals elicits concern about the nutritional status of this group.

40|$|A 3 -year old male {{castrated}} Cocker Spaniel dog {{was referred}} to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals (CUHA) Emergency Service on May 31 st, 2011, for presumptive congestive heart failure. At home, the patient was fed a vegan diet. Initial assessment revealed tachycardia, a grade II-III/VI heart murmur and increased lung sounds bilaterally. Thoracic radiographs revealed changes consistent with congestive heart failure. An echocardiogram demonstrated dilated cardiomyopathy. Blood taurine and carnitine levels were measured and both were low. A dose of furosemide was administered IV and oxygen therapy was initiated. The patient was started on pimobendan, enalapril, <b>carnitine</b> <b>and</b> <b>taurine</b> {{as well as a}} CRI of furosemide. He was switched to a commercial canine diet. He continued to improve with treatment and he was discharged to the care of his owner two days later. Follow-up echocardiograms revealed continued improvement in systolic function but the patient is still being maintained on his cardiac medications as well as supplementation with taurine and carnitine. Using the above case as an example, the pathophysiology of dilated cardiomyopathy with a focus on taurine and carnitine deficiency will be discussed...|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{permanent}} question about the ideal fluid for <b>carnitine</b> <b>and</b> acylcarnitine analysis by tandem mass spectrometry. The present study evaluates the percentage of <b>carnitine</b> <b>and</b> acylcarnitines in red blood cells and {{the relationship with the}} <b>carnitine</b> <b>and</b> acylcarnitines content in whole blood, plasma, and serum. Human blood samples were centrifuged, plasma or serum extracted, and blood cells were washed with different isotonic solutions.

40|$|Age-related {{bone loss}} {{eventually}} leads to osteopenia {{in men and}} women. The etiology of age-related bone loss is currently unknown; however, decreased osteoblast activity contributes to this phenomenon. In turn, osteoblast proliferation and function is dependent on energy production, thus the loss of energy production that occurs with age {{may account for the}} deficient osteoblast activity. <b>Carnitine</b> <b>and</b> dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEAS), both of which decline with age, promote energy production through fatty acid metabolism. Thus, we hypothesized that <b>carnitine</b> <b>and</b> DHEAS would increase osteoblast activity in vitro. Accordingly, we measured the effect of <b>carnitine</b> <b>and</b> DHEAS on palmitic acid oxidation as a measure of energy production, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and collagen type I (COL) as indices of osteoblast function in primary porcine osteoblast-like cell cultures. Carnitine (10 − 3 and 10 − 1 M) but not DHEAS (10 − 9, 10 − 8, and 10 − 7 M) increased carnitine levels within the cells. <b>Carnitine</b> alone <b>and</b> in combination with DHEAS increased palmitic acid oxidation. Both <b>carnitine</b> <b>and</b> DHEAS alone and in an additive fashion increased ALP activity and COL levels. These results demonstrate that in osteoblast-like cells in vitro, energy production can be increased by <b>carnitine</b> <b>and</b> osteoblast protein production can be increased by both <b>carnitine</b> <b>and</b> DHEAS. These data suggest that <b>carnitine</b> <b>and</b> DHEAS supplementation in the elderly may stimulate osteoblast activity and decrease age-related bone loss...|$|R

40|$|All animals, {{except for}} the placental mammals, {{conjugate}} their bile acids exclusively with taurine. However, in certain of the placental mammals, glycine conjugates are also found. The basis for the appearance of glycine conjugation among the placental mammals was investigated. The reaction of choloyl-CoA with glycine <b>and</b> <b>taurine,</b> as catalysed by the soluble fraction from guinea-pig liver, had a high affinity for <b>taurine</b> <b>and</b> a poor affinity for glycine. The predominant synthesis of glycine conjugates in the guinea pig {{can be related to}} the fact that guinea-pig liver contains an unusually low concentration of <b>taurine</b> <b>and</b> a high concentration of glycine. Rabbits make exclusively glycine conjugates and their livers also contain low concentrations of taurine. However, the biochemical basis for their glycine conjugation is more straightforward than in the guinea pig in that the soluble fraction from rabbit liver has a high affinity for glycine and a poor affinity for taurine. Alternative-substrate-inhibition studies with glycine <b>and</b> <b>taurine</b> in soluble fractions from guinea-pig and rabbit liver revealed that glycine <b>and</b> <b>taurine</b> were mutually inhibitory. This suggests {{that there is only one}} enzyme for glycine <b>and</b> <b>taurine</b> conjugation in these tissues.

Endogenous carnitine is found in its free form or esterified with acyl groups of several chain lengths. Quantification of <b>carnitine</b> <b>and</b> acylcarnitines is of particular interest for screening for research and metabolic disorders. We developed a method with online solid-phase extraction coupled to high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry to quantify <b>carnitine</b> <b>and</b> three acylcarnitines with different polarity (acetylcarnitine, octanoylcarnitine, and palmitoylcarnitine). Plasma samples were deproteinized with methanol, loaded on a cation exchange trapping column and separated on a reversed-phase C 8 column using heptafluorobutyric acid as an ion-pairing reagent. Considering the endogenous nature of the analytes, we quantified with the standard addition method and with external deuterated standards. Solid-phase extraction and separation were achieved within 8  min. Recoveries of <b>carnitine</b> <b>and</b> acylcarnitines were between 98 and 105  %. Both quantification methods were equally accurate (all values within 84 to 116  % of target concentrations) and precise (day-to-day variation of less than 18  %) for all <b>carnitine</b> species <b>and</b> concentrations analyzed.

40|$|Background The {{effects of}} sex and oral {{contraceptives}} (OCs) on blood metabolites have been scarcely studied. Considering {{the widespread use of}} OCs and the fact that protocol designs for clinical trials emphasise the use of contraception for women of childbearing potential, we examined if OCs and sex affect the serum levels of the physiologically relevant amino acids, <b>carnitine</b> <b>and</b> acylcarnitines, using metabolomics approaches. Methods Thirty-five healthy adult men and 67 women aged between 20 and 47 years were enrolled. They were drug free with the exception of women taking cyclic format OCs that contained ethinylestradiol and different progestins. OC-free women were analysed during the first ten days of their menstrual cycles, and amino acids, free <b>carnitine</b> <b>and</b> acylcarnitines were measured using HPLC or LC/MS/MS. Results The serum levels of alanine, serine, aspartic acid, arginine <b>and</b> <b>taurine</b> were not significantly different among the analysed groups. Men had significantly higher leucine, isoleucine, methionine, phenylalanine, asparagine, glutamine + glutamate, and histidine than women who did not use OCs, while tryptophan was significantly lower in men. OC use significantly decreased the levels of glycine, proline, glutamine + glutamate, lysine, hydroxyproline and ornitine when compared with non-user women. The level of free carnitine was higher in men than in women; in addition, OC use further reduced the levels of carnitine in women although the reduction is not significant. Total esterified carnitines were higher in untreated women when compared with that of men and OC users. Globally, the effect of OCs and sex was specific for the individual esterified carnitine. The observed metabolic changes were not attributable to renal or hepatic functions or to differences in body weight. Conclusion The assessed parameters were specifically influenced by sex, highlighting the need to have reference values for women and men. The major novelty of this study is the demonstration that OCs speciﬁcally change the profiles of serum amino acids <b>and</b> <b>carnitine,</b> which suggests that OC users and non-users should be represented in clinical trials...|$|R

40|$|Cation-π {{interactions}} {{have been}} demonstrated {{to play a major}} role in agonist-binding in Cys-loop receptors. However, neither the aromatic amino acid contributing to this interaction nor its location is conserved among Cys-loop receptors. Likewise, it is not clear how many different agonists of a given receptor form a cation-π interaction or, if they do, whether it is with the same aromatic amino acid as the major physiological agonist. We demonstrated previously that Phe 159 in the glycine receptor (GlyR) α 1 subunit forms a strong cation-π interaction with the principal agonist, glycine. In the current study, we investigated whether the lower efficacy agonists of the human GlyR β-alanine <b>and</b> <b>taurine</b> also form cation-π interactions with Phe 159. By incorporating a series of unnatural amino acids, we found cation-β interactions between Phe 159 and the amino groups of β-alanine <b>and</b> <b>taurine.</b> The strengths of these interactions were significantly weaker than for glycine. Modeling studies suggest that β-alanine <b>and</b> <b>taurine</b> are orientated subtly differently in the binding pocket, with their amino groups further from Phe 159 than that of glycine.

40|$|The {{effects of}} urea <b>and</b> <b>taurine</b> osmolytes on the {{hydrophobic}} interactions of methane and neopentane {{have been studied}} using molecular dynamics simulations. From the study of potential of mean force, {{it is observed that}} both urea <b>and</b> <b>taurine</b> enhance the association of methane and neopentane. The hydrophobic association of methane molecules is stabilized by entropy and destabilized by enthalpy in the mixtures of osmolytes at contact minima while the hydrophobic association of neopentane is stabilized by enthalpy and entropy. In these mixtures, hydrophobic solvation of methane molecules is enthalpy favorable and entropy unfavorable at SSM. The hydrophobic solvation of neopentane is stabilized by entropy and enthalpy. The study of radial distribution functions (RDFs), running coordination numbers, excess coordination numbers of water, urea <b>and</b> <b>taurine</b> molecules around hydrophobic molecules shows that methane shows salting-out (less soluble) and neopentane shows salting-in (more soluble) behavior in aqueous-urea. Methane and neopentane show salting-in behavior in aqueous-taurine solution because of preferential solvation by taurine. Salting-out behavior of methane has been observed in water-urea-taurine mixture. Neopentane shows salting-in behavior in aqueous solution of urea <b>and</b> <b>taurine</b> because of preferential binding with urea. These observations are supported by solvation free energies and spatial density maps. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
