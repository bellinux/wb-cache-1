5|$|William Edington (died 6 or 7 October 1366) was an English {{bishop and}} administrator.

For Keen Dreams, the team reprised their roles, and used the game as a prototype for what they wanted to change for the next Keen games for Apogee: an increase in graphical quality with parallax scrolling to make the background move at a different speed than the foreground, a pseudo-3D view rather than a side-on view, ramps rather than solely flat surfaces, support for sound cards, and changes to the design based on player feedback. The game's plot, as a result, was designed to be a standalone game outside of the continuity of the main series, and not a true sequel.|$|E
