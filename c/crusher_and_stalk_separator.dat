She has a <b>crush</b> on Kohanamaru <b>and</b> <b>stalks</b> him as a result. She teams up with Konatsu in order to un-cover the truth behind Nanao and Kohanamaru’s ability to switch bodies. By appearance in chapter ten, she also practices the art of witchcraft, when she used a voodoo doll on Kohanamaru {{when he was in}} Nanao’s body.|$|R

He was actually captured and forced to be Mikoto's manservant, a disgrace to his [...] "father" [...] Mikela. To redeem himself he captures the other Abarangers, developing a <b>crush</b> on Ranru <b>and</b> <b>stalking</b> her by telephone. However, after the Killer Giganoid incident Yatsudenwani joined Dino House as a staff member. In #44, Yatsudenwani uses TeleCroco Dream to put the Abarangers {{into a deep sleep}} (until they wake up and retaliate with Super Dino Bomber); the episode was the Trinoid's bad dream. Yatsudenwani chooses to stay on Earth; in Dekaranger vs. Abaranger he is CEO of Dino House, and has an artifact capable of resurrecting Dezumozorya. He is voiced by Kyōsei Tsukui (Tsukui Kyōsei).|$|R

Although roots <b>and</b> <b>stalks</b> are used in traditional herbal medicine along with the flower, the petals and other flower parts are the most potent. Alcohol {{can be used to}} extract the active alkaloids, and it also boosts the sedative effects. The root of the plant was used by monks and nuns for hundreds of years as an anaphrodisiac, being <b>crushed</b> <b>and</b> mixed with wine. In the earliest printed medical textbooks, authors maintained this use, though warning against consuming large and frequent doses.|$|R

40|$|Sprouting {{angiogenesis}} is {{a dynamic}} process in which endothelial cells collectively migrate, shape new lumenized tubes, make new connections, and remodel the nascent network into a hierarchically branched and functionally perfused vascular bed. Endothelial cells in the nascent sprout adopt two distinct cellular phenotypes-known as tip <b>and</b> <b>stalk</b> cells-with specialized functions and gene expression patterns. VEGF and Notch signaling engage in an intricate cross talk to balance tip <b>and</b> <b>stalk</b> cell formation <b>and</b> to regulate directed tip cell migration <b>and</b> <b>stalk</b> cell proliferation. In this article, we summarize the current knowledge and implications of the tip/stalk cell concepts and the quantitative and dynamic integration of VEGF and Notch signaling in tip <b>and</b> <b>stalk</b> cell selection. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Corn {{residues}} (cobs, leaves <b>and</b> <b>stalks)</b> are abundantly available renewable {{materials that}} can be used as an energy source in gasification and combustion systems. Proper understanding of the physical properties of these materials is necessary for their use in thermochemical conversion processes. The physical properties (moisture content, particle size, bulk density and porosity) of corn cobs, leaves <b>and</b> <b>stalks</b> were determined in this study. The moisture contents were 6. 38, 7. 92 and 6. 40 % of the cobs, leaves <b>and</b> <b>stalks,</b> respectively. The cobs had the highest weight percentage (18. 23 %) of the small particles (0. 850 mm). Most of the stalk particles (84. 82 %) were in the range of 0. 212 - 0. 850 mm. The cob particle size had a normal concave (inward) distribution between particle sizes 0. 106 mm (18. 23 weight %) and 0. 925 mm (25. 26 weight %) with the lowest weight percentage (5. 30 weight %) at 0. 390 mm particle size while the stalk particle size had a normal convex (outward) distribution between particle sizes 0. 106 mm (8. 49 weight %) and 0. 925 mm (6. 69 weight %) with the highest weight percentage (23. 47 weight %) at the 0. 605 mm particle size. The leaves had an increasing trend of particle size distribution between the particle sizes 0. 106 and 0. 925 mm. The average particle sizes for the cobs, leaves <b>and</b> <b>stalks</b> were 0. 56, 0. 70 and 0. 49 mm, respectively. The average bulk density was 282. 38, 81. 61 and 127. 32 kg m - 3 for the corn cobs, leaves <b>and</b> <b>stalks,</b> respectively. The average porosity was 67. 93, 86. 06 and 58. 51 % for the corn cobs, leaves <b>and</b> <b>stalks,</b> respectively. A positive relationship between the average particle size and the porosity was observed for the corn residues. The differences in the physical properties among the corn residues (cobs, leaves <b>and</b> <b>stalks)</b> observed in this study are due to variations in the compositions and structures of these materials...|$|R
