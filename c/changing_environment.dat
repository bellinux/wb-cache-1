However, the fossil record retains evidence of many of these older species.

5|$|The {{real problem}} for U.S. {{planners}} {{was a lack of}} sufficient intelligence on the numbers of infiltrators, the amount of supplies being transported, the number of trucks operating, the specific locations of targets in a rapidly <b>changing</b> <b>environment,</b> and the infrastructure of the system. This lack of real intelligence forced the Air Force to basically take its best guess as to PAVN numbers, intentions, and limitations. For instance, Air Force intelligence claimed that 9,012 enemy trucks were destroyed during 1969. Yet, an even lesser estimate of trucks destroyed by the Defense Intelligence Agency only resulted in their computer model reaching zero (where the enemy was supposed to be out of trucks) no fewer that 14 times during the same time period.|$|E
5|$|While similar lifeforms {{have been}} known to exist in {{shallower}} oceanic trenches (>7,000m) and on the abyssal plain, the lifeforms discovered in the Challenger Deep may represent independent taxa from those shallower ecosystems. This preponderance of soft-shelled organisms at the Challenger Deep may be a result of selection pressure. Millions of years ago, the Challenger Deep was shallower than it is now. Over the past six to nine million years, as the Challenger Deep grew to its present depth, many of the species present in the sediment of that ancient biosphere were unable to adapt to the increasing water pressure and <b>changing</b> <b>environment.</b> Those species that were able to adapt may have been the ancestors of the organisms currently endemic to the Challenger Deep.|$|E

5|$|Brasenose's {{finances}} {{entered the}} second half of the century in poor shape, and considerably worse than the period between 1930 and 1931, slipping relative to other colleges from 3rd to 8th. But they were improved during Last's tenure, along with undergraduate admissions; the college showed a surplus in 1952–53, and income in 1957 (£104,000) was double what it had been in 1938. Pay for fellows was still poor, and they were small in number compared to other colleges. There was a sizeable entertainment budget, however, something which, combined with the long hours, have contributed to short lifespans. Only in 1987 did a sitting fellow reach retirement age. Last resigned as Principal in 1956, dying shortly after. Turnover was considerable, although some fellows stayed on: Maurice Platnauer became Principal in 1956, and retired in 1960; he was replaced by Sir Noel Hall. Hall's tenure was troubled, not externally, but rather from Hall's patchy knowledge of the college and staff; his selection, faute de mieux, was sometimes questioned, although he remained well-liked. However, the college, which had thus far stayed assured, found itself in a <b>changing</b> <b>environment.</b> Herbert Hart, however, Principal between 1973 and 1978, was the first to be elected from outside Brasenose. Lord Windlesham, made principal in 1989, was the first to hold Cabinet Office.|$|E

While there is a wealth of prescriptive literature about how managers should behave in situations of change, surprisingly little research that {{has been carried out}} with senior managers and their actual responses to change. The purpose of this research is to investigate the responses of senior managers to externally imposed change in fast <b>changing</b> <b>environments.</b> Specifically the focus is how senior managers respond to change in <b>changing</b> <b>environments</b> and how they respond in different <b>changing</b> <b>environments.</b> Because of the exploratory nature of this investigation, the objective was to develop a framework which could explore the responses of senior managers within <b>changing</b> <b>environments.</b> A conceptual framework based on the open systems model of systems/environment interaction of the individual managers and the relationship with environment was developed from early work on purposeful systems, and idealseeking systems. Theoretical premises and propositions were developed and used to investigate and analyse the responses of senior managers...|$|R

Traditional prescriptive approaches, oriented around process control, are considered suboptimal in meeting this challenge. In this article, the authors present an exploratory theory-building study aiming to identify the project management approaches used by experienced practitioners to respond to rapidly <b>changing</b> <b>environments.</b> The results of 37 semistructured interviews with 31 participants across 10 industries (i. e., construction, aerospace, international community development, pharmaceutical, defense, film production, start-ups, venture capital, research, and information technology) were analyzed according to the planning styles used.
