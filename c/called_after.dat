5|$|Henry Walter Bates's 1863 book The Naturalist on the River Amazons {{describes}} his extensive {{studies of the}} insects in the Amazon basin, and especially the butterflies. He discovered that apparently similar butterflies often belonged to different families, with a harmless species mimicking a poisonous or bitter-tasting species to reduce its chance of being attacked by a predator, in the process now <b>called</b> <b>after</b> him, Batesian mimicry.|$|E
5|$|In January 1992, the Sarajevo Agreement {{was signed}} by representatives of Croatia, the JNA and the UN, and a ceasefire <b>called.</b> <b>After</b> a series of {{unsuccessful}} ceasefires, the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) was deployed to Croatia to supervise and maintain the agreement. The conflict largely passed on to entrenched positions, and the JNA soon retreated from Croatia into Bosnia and Herzegovina, where a new conflict was anticipated.|$|E
5|$|Sejm deputies doing {{legislative}} {{work were}} generally {{not able to}} act as they pleased. Regional szlachta assemblies, the sejmiks, were summoned before sessions of general sejm; there the local nobility provided their representatives with copious {{instructions on how to}} proceed and protect the interests of the area involved. Another sejmik was <b>called</b> <b>after</b> the Sejm's conclusion. At that time the deputies would report to their constituency on what had been accomplished.|$|E

5|$|In 1733 the {{requirements}} for {{a call to the}} Bar were significantly revised in a joint meeting between the Benchers of Inner Temple and Gray's Inn, revisions accepted by Lincoln's Inn and Middle Temple, although they were not represented. It is not recorded what these changes were, but after a further discussion in 1762 the Inns adopted a rule that any student with a Master of Arts or Bachelor of Laws degree from the universities of Oxford or Cambridge could be called to the Bar after three years as a student, and any other student could be <b>called</b> <b>after</b> five years. An attempt was made to increase the quality of legal education at Gray's Inn; in 1753 a barrister, Danby Pickering, was employed to lecture there, although this agreement ended in 1761 when he was called to the Bar.|$|E
5|$|On September 21, Neuer made an {{appearance}} as a relief pitcher {{in a game}} against the Detroit Tigers, taking over for Bill Hogg due to the latter's ineffectiveness. His next appearance as a starter was against the St. Louis Browns. He was unable to control the baseball due to rain; the 5–2 game was <b>called</b> <b>after</b> six innings as a result, giving Neuer his second loss. His final appearance of the season was on October 3 against the Chicago White Sox. In that game, he allowed three hits in an 8–0 victory for his third and final shutout of the season. Neuer spent the offseason working as a hotel clerk, and after signing a contract for the 1908 season, he joined the team for spring training.|$|E
5|$|On a joint ballot of the General Assembly in 1900, Bradley was {{defeated}} {{for a seat}} in the U.S. Senate by a vote of 75–54. After the unseating of Taylor, the state Republican party split into factions, with Godfrey Hunter at the head of one and Bradley {{at the head of the}} other. The two factions formed a tentative alliance to nominate Danville law professor John W. Yerkes in the special election <b>called</b> <b>after</b> Goebel's assassination, but Yerkes lost to Democratic nominee J. C. W. Beckham. At the 1904 Republican National Convention, Bradley was chosen to second the nomination of Theodore Roosevelt for president.|$|E

The two talk, and Rose mentions that her husband is in the bathroom. The plane gets exceptionally shaky, causing a man to hit the plane's ceiling and oxygen masks to fall.|$|E
5|$|Since 1971, {{additional}} piecemeal amendments {{have been}} added in response to federal developments.

A legislative session now may be <b>called</b> <b>after</b> a Governor's veto. Virginia joined thirty-two other states in 1996 by amending its Constitution to provide for rights of victims of crime. Since 1996 Virginia and other states have adopted a provision protecting {{the right of the}} people to hunt, fish and harvest game.|$|E
5|$|Team Lidstrom won {{the game}} 11–10, the 21 {{combined}} goals was the fourth highest total scored in an NHL All-Star Game. The first Penalty shot in All-Star Game history was <b>called</b> <b>after</b> Ovechkin threw his stick to break-up a Matt Duchene breakaway. Registering one goal and two assists, Patrick Sharp of the losing Team Staal won the Most Valuable Player Award. Jeff Skinner was the youngest player to ever play in an NHL All-Star Game. Shea Weber recorded four assists, making him only the second defenceman to accomplish the feat in one All-Star Game. Fellow defenceman Lidstrom registered a +7 rating, the highest in an All-Star Game since 1991. Winning goaltender Tim Thomas became the first goaltender in NHL history to win three consecutive All-Star Games.|$|E

5|$|When first {{playing the}} game, the {{scenarios}} for all five heroines and additional smaller scenarios {{are available in}} {{what is called the}} School Life story arc. When the player completes a character's scenario, he or she receives an orb of light. When eight of these lights are obtained, the game's second story arc, <b>called</b> <b>After</b> Story, is made available. One of the lights disappears during School Life, but reappears in After Story. To view the true ending of Clannad, all 13 lights must be obtained. Originally, the lights were meant to be items that players could use in the game, but since this increased the game's complexity, and detracted from the storyline, the function of the lights was simplified and made less intrusive.|$|E
