30|$|The {{results of}} our study {{demonstrate}} that open reduction and K-wire fixation of displaced (> 2  mm) lateral humeral <b>condyle</b> <b>fractures</b> leads to excellent clinical and radiological results without any significant complications.

K-wires can be buried and left in situ until union or they can be left unburied and require removal after four weeks, with plaster immobilisation until union.

40|$|SummaryIntroductionDistal humerus <b>condyle</b> <b>fracture</b> in {{children}} is rare. These fractures often mislead the emergency physician or surgeon. However, treatment {{adapted to the}} degree of displacement achieves excellent clinical and radiographic results. The objective {{of this study was to}} clarify indications for conservative treatment of lateral humeral <b>condyle</b> <b>fracture</b> {{in children}}. Materials and methodsTwenty-two children who had sustained lateral humeral <b>condyle</b> <b>fracture</b> between January 2007 and January 2010 were reviewed in April 2010. At this consultation, the children underwent clinical and radiological examination. The Hardacre functional score was used to determine objective clinical outcome. ResultsConservative treatment was exclusive to cases of lateral condyle displacement equal to or less than 1 mm. All other fractures were managed by surgical open reduction and fixation using cross-pinning. There was no statistically significant difference in clinical or radiological outcome between conservative and surgical management. DiscussionLateral humeral <b>condyle</b> <b>fracture</b> is difficult to diagnose in children. The majority of poor results reported in literature relate to inadequate initial treatment. Given a radiological aspect of hemarthrosis of the elbow, the emergency physician prescribes multiple X-ray views of the affected elbow (anteroposterior, lateral and internal oblique). The clinical aspect of lateral humeral <b>condyle</b> <b>fracture</b> is often characteristic (ecchymosis facing the head of the radius). Nondisplaced or minimally displaced lateral humeral <b>condyle</b> <b>fracture</b> can be managed conservatively under close survey. However, secondary displacement under the cast is often difficult or impossible to detect, and outpatient surgery is therefore being increasingly indicated in our department.

40|$|Abstract Background There is {{paucity of}} {{literature}} describing complex elbow trauma in the pediatric population. We described {{a case of}} an uncommon pediatric elbow injury comprised of lateral <b>condyle</b> <b>fracture</b> associated with posterolateral dislocation of elbow. Case presentation A 12 -year-old boy sustained a direct elbow trauma and presented with Milch type II lateral <b>condyle</b> <b>fracture</b> associated with posterolateral dislocation of elbow. Elbow dislocation was managed by closed reduction. The elbow stability was assessed under general anaesthesia, followed by open K-wiring for the lateral condylar fracture fixation. The patient had an uneventful recovery with an excellent outcome at 39 months follow-up. Conclusion Complex pediatric elbow injuries are quite unusual to encounter, the management of such fractures can be technically demanding. Concomitant elbow dislocation should be managed by closed reduction followed by open reduction and internal fixation (K-wires or cannulated screws) of the lateral <b>condyle</b> <b>fracture.</b> </p...|$|E
30|$|Clinical {{presentation}} of occipital <b>condyle</b> <b>fractures</b> is variable but concomitant head injury {{is a frequent}} finding. The anatomical location of the occipital condyles means that the brainstem, the lower cranial nerves (cranial nerves IX–XII) and venous and arterial vessels are at particular risk {{in the event of}} fracture. Lower cranial nerve palsies (including Collet–Sicard syndrome where all of the cranial nerves IX–XII are affected) may be acute in two-thirds of cases [35, 41, 45 – 51]. Delayed cranial nerve palsies may result from migration of fracture fragments or proliferation of fibrous tissue. Vascular complications related to occipital <b>condyle</b> <b>fractures</b> include internal carotid artery and vertebral artery traumatic dissection, arteriovenous fistulae of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery and Wallenberg syndrome (lateral medullary syndrome) [35, 49].|$|R
30|$|Determining the {{magnitude}} of displacement in pediatric lateral humeral <b>condyle</b> <b>fractures</b> can be difficult. The {{purpose of this study}} was to (1) assess the effect of forearm rotation on true fracture displacement using a cadaver model and to (2) determine the accuracy of radiographic measurements of the fracture gap.|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} {{the value of}} ultrasonography in non-displaced and mini-displaced humeral lateral <b>condyle</b> <b>fractures</b> in children. MethodsNine children aged 2 - 9 years with non-dis-placed or mini-displaced humeral lateral <b>condyle</b> <b>fractures</b> were examined by high-resolution ultrasonography. The fracture line through the joint surface was visualized by ultrasonography in 6 case, in which closed reduction and percutaneous pinning was performed on 3 patients and other 3 patients did not receive the treatment because of or their refusal. In the remaining 3 children, ultra-sonography did not reveal the cartilaginous trochle involve-ment at the joint surface and conservative treatment was adopted. ResultsThe average follow-up period was 8 months. The sonographic findings were confirmed by magnetic reso-nance imaging in one child who received conservative treatment and another child who received percutaneous pinning. The elbow function and fracture healing were good in cases received closed reduction and percutaneous pinning. Among the three cases who refused to receive closed re-duction and internal fixation, re-displacement occurred in 1 case and delayed union in 1 case. All three cases receiving conservative treatment had good results both in elbow function and fracture healing. ConclusionHigh-resolution ultrasonography enable to reveal non-displaced and mini-displaced humeral lateral <b>condyle</b> <b>fractures</b> {{as well as to}} ascertain whether the carti-laginous trochlea humeri was involved. For these cases, arthrography or magnetic resonance imaging is unnecessary...|$|R
30|$|In all case reports, {{the patient}} {{characteristics}} were described. The average age at injury was 7.8  years (range 2 – 15 years) [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 21, 22, 23, 24]. In nine studies, {{the sex of}} the patient was noted [12, 13, 16, 17, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25]. Most patients were male (74  %). Twenty-eight patients had a lateral humeral <b>condyle</b> <b>fracture</b> (48  %) [11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 24], 18 patients had a supracondylar fracture (31  %) [11, 16, 17, 21, 22], three patients had a capitellum fracture (5  %) [12], three patients had a medial humeral <b>condyle</b> <b>fracture</b> (5  %) [21, 23, 25], one patient had an external humeral <b>condyle</b> <b>fracture</b> (2  %) [19], in four patients the exact location of the fracture was unknown (7  %) [17, 21] and in one patient the injury is unknown (2  %) [17]. The average follow-up time was 69  months [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25].|$|E
40|$|Purpose Many {{studies are}} {{available}} in the literature on both classification and treatment of unilateral mandibular condyle fractures. To date however, controversy regarding the best treatment for unilateral mandibular condyle fractures remains. Material and methods In this study, an attempt was made to quantify the level of agreement between a sample of maxillofacial surgeons worldwide, on the classification and treatment decisions in three different unilateral mandibular <b>condyle</b> <b>fracture</b> cases. Results In total, 491 of 3044 participants responded. In all three mandibular <b>condyle</b> <b>fracture</b> cases, a fairly high level of disagreement was found. Only {{in the case of a}} subcondylar fracture, assuming dysocclusion was present, more than 81 % of surgeons agreed that the best treatment would be open reduction and internal fixation. Conclusions Based on the study results, there is considerable variation among surgeons worldwide with regard to treatment of unilateral mandibular <b>condyle</b> <b>fracture.</b> 3 D imaging in higher fractures tends to lead to more invasive treatment decisions...|$|E
40|$|Condylar and angle {{fractures}} are {{the most}} common types of mandibular injuries. There is evidence in the literature suggesting that the presence of unerupted lower third molars increases the risk of angle fracture and reduces the chance of <b>condyle</b> <b>fracture.</b> The present paper reports on a case of a 19 -year-old Caucasian man who had bilateral angle fracture associated with the two lower unerupted third molars. No other fracture was detected on the panoramic radiograph. This case suggests that unerupted lower third molars increase the risk of angle fracture whereas preventing <b>condyle</b> <b>fracture.</b> Reduction of the bone mass of the angle in the presence of third molars and disruption of the oblique ridge with partially erupted molars support our fi ndings. As the treatment of <b>condyle</b> <b>fracture</b> is more complex, it might not be appropriate to strengthen the mandibular angle, making the mandible more vulnerable to condylar fractures by means of prophylactic extraction of asymptomatic unerupted third molars...|$|E
40|$|Pediatric elbow {{fractures}} can {{be challenging}} to manage. Compression of the medial column in Gartland Type I and Type II supracondylar fractures must be reduced to prevent varus deformity. Gartland Type III fractures may be stabilized with two lateral pins or a medial lateral cross-pin technique. Non-displaced lateral <b>condyle</b> <b>fractures</b> require vigilant follow-up. Open reduction of displaced lateral <b>condyle</b> <b>fractures</b> should avoid posterior dissection. T-condylar fractures in children rarely have the articular comminution found in adults. Monteggia fractures in children can be managed well if recognized and treated promptly. Restoration of the ulnar length often reduces the radial head. Angulated proximal radius fractures need to be reduced in order to restore the ability to supinate and pronate. It {{is important to recognize}} and understand the diagnostic features of each type of fracture {{in order to determine the}} best course of treatment...|$|R
30|$|Occipital <b>condyle</b> <b>fractures</b> occur {{secondary}} to multiple mechanisms of trauma. These fractures are commonly classified {{as described by}} Anderson and Montesano [4, 5]. Type 1 is a comminuted impaction fracture caused by axial loading and type 2 fractures propagate through the skull base. Both type 1 and 2 injuries are typically stable if unilateral and unstable if bilateral.|$|R
30|$|Several {{criteria}} {{have been}} recommended {{to predict the}} stability of minimally-displaced lateral <b>condyle</b> <b>fractures</b> using the standard radiographs [3]; however, despite adherence to these guidelines, fractures showing minimal displacement on initial radiographs may still displace further. Subsequent displacement while in a cast may lead to delayed union or non-union requiring operative treatment [2, 8, 9, 11, 13, 20].|$|R
40|$|Fracture of {{mandible}} can {{be classified}} according to its anatomical location, in which condylar fracture {{is the most common}} one overall and is missed on clinical examination. Due to the unique geometry of the mandible and temporomandibular joint, without treatment the fractures can result in marked pain, dysfunction, and deformity. The condylar fracture may be further classified depending on the sides involved: unilateral/bilateral, depending on the height of fracture: intracapsular (within the head of condyle), extracapsular - head and neck (high <b>condyle</b> <b>fracture),</b> and subcondylar (low <b>condyle</b> <b>fracture),</b> and depending on displacement: nondisplaced, displaced (anteromedially, medially, and lateral), and dislocated. The clinical features include swelling and tenderness over the temporomandibular joint region, restricted mouth opening, and anterior open bite.

30|$|Until the {{emergence}} of CT technology, occipital condyle fractures were considered rare but, in fact, were probably significantly under-reported.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Moore type II Entire <b>Condyle</b> <b>fractures</b> of the tibia plateau {{represent}} {{a rare and}} highly unstable fracture pattern that usually results from high impact traumas. Specific recommendations regarding the surgical treatment of these fractures are sparse. We present a series of Moore type II fractures treated by open reduction and internal fixation through a direct dorsal approach. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five patients (3 females, 2 males) with Entire <b>Condyle</b> <b>fractures</b> were retrospectively analyzed after a mean follow-up period of 39 months (range 12 - 61 months). Patient mean age {{at the time of}} operation was 36 years (range 26 - 43 years). Follow-up included clinical and radiological examination. Furthermore, all patient finished a SF 36 and Lysholm knee score questionnaire. RESULTS: Average range of motion was 127 / 0 / 1 degrees with all patients reaching full extension at the time of last follow up. Patients reached a mean Lysholm score of 81. 2 points (range 61 - 100 points) and an average SF 36 of 82. 36 points (range 53. 75 - 98. 88 points). One patient sustained deep wound infection after elective implant removal 1 year after the initial surgery. Overall all patients were highly satisfied with the postoperative result. CONCLUSION: The direct dorsal approach to the tibial plateau represents an adequate method to enable direct fracture exposure, open reduction, and internal fixation in posterior shearing medial Entire <b>Condyle</b> <b>fractures</b> and is especially valuable when also the dorso-lateral plateau is depressed...|$|R
40|$|Computed {{tomography}} (CT) {{has been}} increasingly {{used in the}} examination of patients with craniofacial trauma. This technique is useful in {{the examination of the}} temporomandibular joint and allows the diagnosis of fractures of the mandibular condyle. Aiming to verify whether the three-dimensional reconstructed images from CT (3 D-CT) produce more effective visual information than the two-dimensional (2 D-CT) ones, we evaluated 2 D-CT and 3 D-CT examinations of 18 patients with mandibular <b>condyle</b> <b>fractures.</b> We observed that 2 D-CT and 3 D-CT reconstructed images produced similar information for the diagnosis of fractures of the mandibular condyle, although the 3 D-CT allowed a better visualization of the position and displacement of bone fragments, as well as the comminution of fractures. These results, together with the possibility of refining and manipulating perspectives in 3 D images, reinforce the importance of its use in the surgical planning and evaluation of treatment. We concluded that 3 D-CT presented supplementary information for a more effective diagnosis of mandibular <b>condyle</b> <b>fractures...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} different fixation {{methods in}} posterior femoral <b>condyle</b> coronal <b>fractures.</b> A standardised osteotomy {{was created in}} synthetic composite femurs and fixed with one of four methods (one 3. 5 mm diameter screw, two 3. 5 mm screws, one 6. 5 mm screw, two 6. 5 mm screws). The stiffness and mean loads to specified displacements were measured. The stiffness of two 6. 5 mm screws was significantly greater than both single 3. 5 mm screw (3567 versus 2584 N/mm; p = 0. 0075) and double 3. 5 mm screws (3567 versus 2080 N/mm; p = 0. 003). There was no statistical difference in the stiffness of one 6. 5 mm screw compared to either the single or double 3. 5 mm screws. Increasing the screw diameter and using two screws increased the load at 1, 2 and 3 mm of displacement. In the fixation of posterior femoral <b>condyle</b> <b>fractures,</b> two 6. 5 mm screws are more rigid than either single or double 3. 5 mm screws. The use of a second screw marginally increases the rigidity of fixation. If 3. 5 mm screws {{are used in the}} fixation of posterior femoral <b>condyle</b> <b>fractures,</b> at least two screws should be used to approximate the biomechanical stability of a single 6. 5 mm screw...|$|R

30|$|Lateral humeral condyle {{fractures}} {{were successfully}} created {{in three of}} the four specimens.
