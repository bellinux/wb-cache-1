40|$|Feather {{damaging}} behaviour in parrots and {{feather pecking}} in laying hens are behavioural disorders that may share an analogous background. In laying hens, a correlation {{has been found}} between the degree of feather pecking {{and the type of}} <b>coping</b> <b>strategy</b> a bird displays. Individuals from a high feather pecking line usually display a pro-active <b>coping</b> <b>strategy</b> (i. e. hawk-type), whereas birds from a low feather pecking line usually display a reactive <b>coping</b> <b>strategy</b> (i. e. dove-type). Dependent on the type of <b>coping</b> <b>strategy,</b> birds may show a different response when confronted with stressing stimuli during a behavioural test. In parrots, the association between type of <b>coping</b> <b>strategy</b> and feather damaging behaviour may also be present. To test this hypothesis, three behavioural tests (manual restraint test, novel object test and the open field test) were performed in a group of 22 grey parrots with and without feather damaging behaviour. In the open field test was found that parrots without feather damaging behaviour showed lower open field activity then parrots with feather damaging behaviour, which is in accordance to findings in laying hens. With the manual restraint test we didn't find any significant outcomes in our data. However, it did appear that parrots with feather damaging behaviour struggled less, but more powerful, whereas parrots without feather damaging behaviour struggled more constant during the 5 -minute test. The results of the novel object test indicate that parrots with feather damaging behaviour show a lower degree of neophobia than parrots without feather damaging behaviour. Based on two out of three behavioural tests that were conducted, it can be concluded that an analogy is present in laying hens and parrots concerning the association between type of <b>coping</b> <b>strategy</b> and presence of behavioural disorder. Similar to feather pecking laying hens, parrots with feather damaging behaviour also display a pro-active <b>coping</b> <b>strategy...</b>|$|R

25|$|A German fMRT-study {{conducted}} by researchers of the Central Institute of Mental Health points towards impairments in social, {{emotional and physical}} aspects of the self-concept and a higher degree in avatar identification in addicted MMORPG players, compared to non-addicted and naive (nonexperienced) people. These findings generally support Davis' cognitive behavioral model of Internet addiction, which postulates that dysfunctional self-related cognitions represent central factors contributing towards the development and maintenance of MMORPG addiction. The high degree of avatar identification found by Leménager et al. in the addicted group of this study indicates that MMORPG playing may represent an attempt to compensate for impairments in self-concept.

25|$|While some {{research}} indicates that psychological resilience is a relatively stable personality trait, new research suggests that positive emotions are critical to trait resilience. This {{is not to say}} that positive emotions are merely a by-product of resilience, but rather that feeling positive emotions during stressful experiences may have adaptive benefits in the coping process of the individual. Empirical evidence for this prediction arises from research on resilient individuals who have a propensity for <b>coping</b> <b>strategies</b> that concretely elicit positive emotions, such as benefit-finding and cognitive reappraisal, humor, optimism, and goal-directed problem-focused coping. Individuals who tend to approach problems with these methods of coping may strengthen their resistance to stress by allocating more access to these positive emotional resources. Social support from caring adults encouraged resilience among participants by providing them with access to conventional activities.|$|E

Control and support as per the DCS model are subsumed under resources. Resources can be external (provided by the organization) or internal (part of a worker's personal make-up). In addition to control and support, resources encompassed by the model can also include physical equipment, software, performance feedback from supervisors, the worker's own <b>coping</b> <b>strategies,</b> etc. There has not, however, been as much research on the JD-R model as there has been on the constituents of the DC or DCS model.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of personal <b>coping</b> <b>strategies</b> (including self-management or self-help) {{is said to}} be an important element.

Developing coping and problem solving skills to manage individual traits and problem issues (which {{may or may not be}} seen as symptoms of mental disorder) may require a person becoming their own expert, in order to identify key stress points and possible crisis points, and to understand and develop personal ways of responding and coping. Developing a sense of meaning and overall purpose {{is said to be}} important for sustaining the recovery process. This may involve recovering or developing a social or work role. It may also involve renewing, finding or developing a guiding philosophy, religion, politics or culture. From a postmodern perspective, this can be seen as developing a narrative.|$|E
25|$|Coping {{occurs in}} {{response}} to psychological stress—usually triggered by changes—in an effort to maintain mental health and emotional well-being. Life stressors are often described as negative events (loss of a job). However, positive changes in life (a new job) can also constitute life stressors, thus requiring the use of coping skills to adapt. <b>Coping</b> <b>strategies</b> are the behaviors, thoughts, and emotions that you use {{to adjust to the}} changes that occur in your life. The use of coping skills will help a person better themselves in the work place and perform {{to the best of their}} ability to achieve success. There are many ways to cope and adapt to changes. Some ways include: sharing emotions with peers, having a healthy social life outside of work, being humorous, and adjusting expectations of self and work. These coping skills will help turn negative emotion to positive and allow for more focus on the public in contrast to oneself.|$|E
25|$|For example: As {{a result}} of heavy traffic, a {{recovering}} alcoholic may decide one afternoon to exit the highway and travel on side roads. This {{will result in the}} creation of a high-risk situation when he realizes he is inadvertently driving by his old favorite bar. If this individual is able to employ successful <b>coping</b> <b>strategies,</b> such as distracting himself from his cravings by turning on his favorite music, then he will avoid the relapse risk (PATH 1) and heighten his efficacy for future abstinence. If, however, he lacks coping mechanisms—for instance, he may begin ruminating on his cravings (PATH 2)—then his efficacy for abstinence will decrease, his expectations of positive outcomes will increase, and he may experience a lapse—an isolated return to substance intoxication. So doing results in what Marlatt refers to as the Abstinence Violation Effect, characterized by guilt for having gotten intoxicated and low efficacy for future abstinence in similar tempting situations. This is a dangerous pathway, Marlatt proposes, to full-blown relapse.|$|E

25|$|There are two {{distinct}} types {{of access to}} food: direct access, in which a household produces food using human and material resources, and economic access, in which a household purchases food produced elsewhere. Location can affect access to food and which type of access a family will rely on.

However, the ability to access sufficient food may not lead to the purchase of food over other materials and services. Demographics and education levels {{of members of the}} household as well as the gender of the household head determine the preferences of the household, which influences the type of food that are purchased. A household's access to enough and nutritious food may not assure adequate food intake of all household members, as intrahousehold food allocation may not sufficiently meet the requirements of each member of the household.

500|$|MTBI has a {{mortality}} rate of almost zero. The symptoms of most concussions resolve within weeks, but problems may persist. These are seldom permanent, and outcome is usually excellent.

People over age55 may take longer to heal from MTBI or may heal incompletely. Similarly, factors such as a previous head injury or a coexisting medical condition have been found to predict longer-lasting post-concussion symptoms. [...] Other factors that may lengthen recovery time after MTBI include psychological problems such as substance abuse or clinical depression, poor health before the injury or additional injuries sustained during it, and life stress. Longer periods of amnesia or loss of consciousness immediately after the injury may indicate longer recovery times from residual symptoms.
