25|$|Fanno flow {{refers to}} {{adiabatic}} flow through a <b>constant</b> <b>area</b> duct where {{the effect of}} friction is considered. Compressibility effects often come into consideration, although the Fanno flow model certainly also applies to incompressible flow. For this model, the duct area remains constant, the flow {{is assumed to be}} steady and one-dimensional, and no mass is added within the duct. The Fanno flow model is considered an irreversible process due to viscous effects. The viscous friction causes the flow properties to change along the duct. The frictional effect is modeled as a shear stress at the wall acting on the fluid with uniform properties over any cross section of the duct.|$|E
25|$|Southwest of the Zugspitze, {{between the}} Zugspitzeck and Schneefernerkopf, is the Northern Schneeferner {{which has an}} eastern aspect. With an area of 30.7 {{hectares}} (2006) {{it is the largest}} German glacier. Around 1820 the entire Zugspitzplatt was glaciated, but of this Platt Glacier (Plattgletscher) only the Northern and Southern Schneeferner remain. The reason for the relatively <b>constant</b> <b>area</b> of the Northern Schneeferner in recent years, despite the lack of shade, is the favourable terrain that results in the glacier tending to grow or shrink in depth rather than area. In the recent past the glacier has also been artificially fed by the ski region operators, using piste tractors to heap large quantities of snow onto the glacier in order to extend the skiing season.|$|E

2500|$|The Fanno flow {{model is}} often used {{in the design and}} {{analysis}} of nozzles. [...] In a nozzle, the converging or diverging area is modeled with isentropic flow, while the <b>constant</b> <b>area</b> section afterwards is modeled with Fanno flow.

[...] However, these figures show the shock wave before it has moved entirely through the duct.

In this study, friction stir welding was carried out on dissimilar copper to aluminum materials by nine different tool designs. Present investigation provides an insight on formation of defects under the effect of different tool pin designs. The tool pin profiles such as cylindrical, triangular, square and hexagonal were used in the present experimental investigation by keeping other parameters constant. These tool pin profiles were designed based on its static and dynamic <b>constant</b> <b>areas</b> from best suitable cylindrical profile. Besides, the defects were analyzed through visual observation, macrostructure, microstructural investigation and scanning electron microscope. The results revealed that, the copper particles detached from base material were large and irregular in case of polygonal pin designs. Maximum irregular and large copper particles were reported in welds made by triangular pin profiles. Additionally, polygonal pin profiles were generating defects such as voids, tunnel, cracks and fragmental defects irrespective of its static and dynamic <b>constant</b> <b>areas.</b> Furthermore, defects were decreased as the polygonal edges increases.

2500|$|The Rayleigh flow {{model has}} many {{analytical}} uses, most notably involving aircraft engines. [...] For instance, the combustion chambers inside turbojet engines {{usually have a}} <b>constant</b> <b>area</b> and the fuel mass addition is negligible. [...] These properties make the Rayleigh flow model applicable for heat addition to the flow through combustion, assuming the heat addition does not result in dissociation of the air-fuel mixture. [...] Producing a shock wave inside the combustion chamber of an engine due to thermal choking is very undesirable due to the decrease in mass flow rate and thrust. [...] Therefore, the Rayleigh flow model is critical for an initial design of the duct geometry and combustion temperature for an engine.|$|E
2500|$|Rayleigh flow {{refers to}} frictionless, non-Adiabatic flow through a <b>constant</b> <b>area</b> duct where {{the effect of}} heat {{addition}} or rejection is considered. [...] Compressibility effects often come into consideration, although the Rayleigh flow model certainly also applies to incompressible flow. [...] For this model, the duct area remains constant and no mass is added within the duct. [...] Therefore, unlike Fanno flow, the stagnation temperature is a variable. [...] The heat addition causes a decrease in stagnation pressure, which {{is known as the}} Rayleigh effect and is critical in the design of combustion systems. [...] Heat addition will cause both supersonic and subsonic Mach numbers to approach Mach 1, resulting in choked flow. [...] Conversely, heat rejection decreases a subsonic Mach number and increases a supersonic Mach number along the duct. [...] It can be shown that for calorically perfect flows the maximum entropy occurs at M = 1. [...] Rayleigh flow is named after John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh.|$|E

30|$|The bearing {{ratio of}} each bSi surface type was {{determined}} from the statistical AFM data, since the protrusion curvatures {{were present in}} both the x, y, and z (height) planes. The variation in the bearing ratio was dependent on {{the height of the}} nanopillars, as shown in Figs. S 3 and S 4. The bearing curve reflected the surface area at a specific depth with respect to the entire area being analyzed. For all samples shown in Fig. S 4, at a height of about 200 Â nm, the bearing curve started to increase in the bearing area fraction and approaches a <b>constant</b> bearing <b>area</b> level within several 100 Â nm. The increase indicated the volume of everything present above the surface, which is the volume of the pillars.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{original}} inhomogeneous restoration (deconvolution) model under the Bayesian framework.

To this end, the parameters of this restoration a priori model relies on an unsupervised Markovian over-segmentation. To compute the MAP estimate associated to the restoration, we use a simple steepest descent procedure resulting in an efficient iterative process converging to a globally optimal restoration. The experiments reported in this paper demonstrate that the discussed method performs competitively and sometimes better than the best existing state-of-the-art methods in benchmark tests. 1...|$|R
