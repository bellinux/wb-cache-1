40|$|Three {{experiments}} were accomplished {{to compare the}} efficacy of yellow and red xanthophylls extracted from Tagetes erectus and Capsicum sp., with synthetic <b>citranaxanthin,</b> canthaxanthin, and ester of beta-apo- 8 -carotenoic pigments at different concentrations to enhance the yellow color of chicken egg yolk. In each trial brown laying hens were placed in cages, and after seven days of feeding a sorghum-soybean diet without pigments treatments were assigned. Yolk eggs were classified with the Roche yolk color fan (RYCF) or Minolta ® refractometer. In the first experiment, 168 hens were randomly distributed to seven treatments with one control group, synthetic pigments, and natural xanthophylls. In {{the second and third}} experiments, 100 hens were assigned to four different treatments consisting in the same basal diet with addition of natural xanthophylls, and three combinations of apo-ester and citranaxantin. In all experiments, after four weeks of feeding these experimental diets, the color of 10 egg yolks per treatment was evaluated 10 different times every other day or twice a week. Results indicated that live performance was not affected by treatments, but the egg yolk color changed significantly according to the pigment added. Hens fed with diets with 7. 5 ppm of yellow xanthophylls extracted from Tagetes and 4. 0 ppm of red xanthophylls from Capsicum had yolk eggs classified as color 11. 7 ± 0. 1. Capsicum extract levels had linear effect over RYCF. Synthetic carotenoids gave a yolk color that varies from 13 to 14 in the highest concentration, and from 12 (5 %) to 14 (43 %) at the lowest concentration...|$|E
40|$|The {{manuscript}} {{presents the}} development of a new reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) photo diode array detection method allowing the separation and quantification of 15 carotenoids (adonirubin, adonixanthin, astaxanthin, astaxanthin dimethyl disuccinate, asteroidenone, beta-apo- 8 '-carotenal, beta-apo- 8 '-carotenoic acid ethyl ester, beta-carotene, canthaxanthin, capsanthin, <b>citranaxanthin,</b> echinenone, lutein, lycopene, and zeaxanthin), 10 of which are feed additives authorised within the European Union. The developed method allows for the reliable determination of the total carotenoid content in one run using the corresponding E-isomer as calibration standard while taking into account the E/Z-isomers composition. This is a key criterion for the application of the method, since for most of the analytes included in this study analytical standards are only available for the E-isomers. This goal was achieved by applying the isosbestic concept, in order to identify specific wavelengths, at which the absorption coefficients are identical for all stereoisomers concerned. The second target referred to the optimisation of the LC conditions. By means of an experimental design, an optimised RP-HPLC method was developed allowing for a sufficient chromatographic separation of all carotenoids. The selected method uses a Suplex pKb- 100 HPLC column and applying a gradient with a mixture of acetonitrile, tert-butyl-methyl ether and water as mobile phases. The limits of detection and limits of quantification ranged from 0. 06 mg L− 1 to 0. 14 mg L− 1 and from 0. 20 mg L− 1 to 0. 48 mg L− 1, respectively. JRC. D. 5 -Standards for Food Bioscienc...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT b-Carotene {{might be}} {{converted}} oxidatively to vitamin A – active products in animals {{by the following}} three possible routes: 1) central cleavage, 2) sequential excentric cleavage or 3) random cleavage. Central cleavage is strongly favored by stoichiometric studies with tissue homogenates in vitro. To examine {{the relative importance of}} these pathways in rats in vivo, an oral dose (5. 6 mmol) of all-trans b-carotene in oil was given to vitamin A–deficient (2 A) and to vitamin A–sufficient (1 A) adult female Sprague-Dawley rats. Serum and several tissues were analyzed before and 3 h after dosing. The primary products of b-carotene found in the intestine, serum and liver were retinol, retinyl esters and retinoic acid. Two minor oxidation products of b-carotene, namely, 5, 6 -epoxy-b-carotene and a partially characterized hydroxy-b-carotene, were present in the stomach and its contents as well as in intestinal preparations. In the intestine, including its contents, of 2 A rats, very minor amounts of 5, 6 -epoxyretinyl palmitate and of b-apocarotenals (89, 109, 129, 149) were identified. The total amount of the b-apo-carotenoids, however, was, 5 % of the retinoids formed in the intestine from b-carotene during the same period. Another b-carotene derivative, with a spectrum similar to that of semi-b-carotenone, <b>citranaxanthin</b> and b-apo- 69 -carotenal, was also found in the intestinal extract of a 2 A rat. b-Apocarotenals, b-apocarotenols, b-apo-carotenyl esters and b-apocarotenoic acids were not detected in tissues of 1 A rats nor in other tissues of 2 A rats. These findings agree with the view that central cleavage is by far the major pathway for the formation of vitami...|$|E
