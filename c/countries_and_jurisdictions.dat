50|$|Whether {{same-sex}} couples {{should be allowed}} to marry has been and remains the topic of debate worldwide. Thirty-one <b>countries</b> <b>and</b> five <b>jurisdictions</b> worldwide have passed constitutional amendments that explicitly prohibit the legal recognition of same-sex marriage and sometimes other forms of legal unions as well. Eighteen <b>countries</b> <b>and</b> thirty-four <b>jurisdictions</b> worldwide have authorized civil unions or unregistered cohabitation for {{same-sex couples}} as an alternative to marriage. The legal name of those unions as well as the amount of rights that they provide can vary greatly.|$|R
25|$|In {{the wake}} of civil {{lawsuits}} and the increasing numbers of reported incidents, legislation has been passed {{in a number of}} <b>countries</b> <b>and</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> to outlaw the practice, though approaches have varied. The practice has also been described as a form of psychological abuse and domestic violence, as well as a form of sexual abuse.|$|E
25|$|Gavage-based {{foie gras}} {{production}} is controversial, due {{mainly to the}} animal welfare concerns about force-feeding, intensive housing and husbandry, and enlarging the liver to 10 times its usual volume. A number of <b>countries</b> <b>and</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> have laws against force-feeding, and the production, import or sale of foie gras; even where it is legal, a number of retailers decline to stock it.|$|E
25|$|Today modern {{spearfishing}} {{makes use}} of elastic powered spearguns and slings, or compressed gas pneumatic powered spearguns, to strike the hunted fish. Specialised techniques and equipment {{have been developed for}} various types of aquatic environments and target fish. Spearfishing may be done using free-diving, snorkelling, or scuba diving techniques. Spearfishing while using scuba equipment is illegal in some countries. The use of mechanically powered spearguns is also outlawed in some <b>countries</b> <b>and</b> <b>jurisdictions.</b> Spearfishing is highly selective, normally uses no bait and has no by-catch.|$|E
30|$|The CPMs/SPFs in the HSM and ISHDM, {{developed}} from data in several US states, {{are not directly}} transferable to other jurisdictions (inside or outside US). Some studies confirmed good transferability, mainly between US states [7, 74, 84], but others were less successful when applied abroad, for example in Canada, Italy or Korea [42, 63, 64, 69, 88]. Therefore, {{it is recommended that}} each <b>country</b> <b>and</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> (e.g. State) develops its own specific CPMs. The present review, written by non-US authors, adopts this perspective.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the legal}} age of consent varies by <b>country</b> <b>and</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> {{the age at}} which a person can be {{considered}} [...] "jailbait" [...] varies. For example, in the United Kingdom, where the age of consent is 16, the term is used to refer to those younger than 16, whereas {{in some parts of the}} United States, where the age of consent is 18, the term would refer to those aged under 18. The frequent use of the term jailbait in popular culture has been linked to a greater understanding of age of consent laws among teenagers.|$|R

25|$|Some <b>countries</b> <b>and</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> have {{explicit}} bans on {{sharia law}}. In Canada, for example, sharia {{law has been}} explicitly banned in Quebec by a 2005 unanimous vote of the National Assembly, while the province of Ontario allows family law disputes to be arbitrated only under Ontario law. In the U.S., opponents of Sharia have sought to ban it from being considered in courts, {{where it has been}} routinely used alongside traditional Jewish and Catholic laws to decide legal, business, and family disputes subject to contracts drafted with reference to such laws, {{as long as they do}} not violate secular law or the U.S. constitution. After failing to gather support for a federal law making observing Sharia a felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison, anti-Sharia activists have focused on state legislatures. By 2014, bills aimed against use of Sharia have been introduced in 34 states and passed in 11. These bills have generally referred to banning foreign or religious law in order to thwart legal challenges.|$|E

40|$|This article {{contributes}} to existing debates on public opinion toward European integration by examining when and why fiscal transfers and public support are systematically related. Drawing on economic and identity-related theories, we develop and test hypotheses about {{the links between}} European Union fiscal transfers among <b>countries</b> <b>and</b> subnational <b>jurisdictions,</b> <b>and</b> citizens' support for European integration. Using a three-level analysis of residents in 143 regions in 16 European Union member states, we find a positive effect of European Union transfers among both <b>countries</b> <b>and</b> subnational <b>jurisdictions</b> on support for European integration among those with a European communal identity. We also find that this effect increases the more politically aware individuals are.
