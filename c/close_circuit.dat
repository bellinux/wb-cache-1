40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 120 - 123). It {{was identified}} that potential improvements in recoveries {{were to be}} found in the better use of the regrind stages at a number of Anglo-Platinum concentrators. Historically, these concentrators used to operate in an open circuit configuration, over a relatively short period, the circuits were changed to <b>closed</b> <b>circuit</b> configurations because of the reported benefits of operating in this configuration. The effect of <b>closing</b> the <b>circuit</b> had, however not been quantified in these concentrators. This dissertation looks at quantifying the effects of each configuration with the purpose of drawing meaningful comparisons between them. The circuit configurations studied are open circuit, I-stage and 2 -stage <b>closed</b> <b>circuit</b> configurations. The primary difference between these configurations is the network of hydrocyclones. This study pays special attention to the effect of cyclone performance on the regrind circuit performance. Comparisons were made between the open and the 2 -stage <b>closed</b> <b>circuits</b> in three concentrators, and surprisingly the <b>closed</b> <b>circuit</b> did not show any improvement over the open circuit configuration from a combination efficiency perspective. The cyclones performance was analysed, and it was observed that the cyclones were operating inefficiently, most likely because the cyclones employed were not appropriate for regrind circuits. A further comparison was made between the I-stage and 2 -stage circuit configurations and the I-stage <b>closed</b> <b>circuit</b> configuration proved to be more efficient than the 2 -stage <b>closed</b> <b>circuit</b> configuration. Simulations were conducted to predict the performance of the circuit configurations by using more appropriate cyclones which are smaller in size. These cyclones are currently being used in a similar application in another concentrator. The simulations indicated that significant improvements in comminution performance could be realised with the utilisation of more appropriate cyclones, to achieve the <b>closed</b> <b>circuit</b> configuration...|$|R

5000|$|Inductive pumps {{use both}} sides of the piston to pump and suction simultaneously. This means that {{both sides of}} the pump piston are always {{experiencing}} the inlet pressure at a minimum until the pressure cycle that would exceed the inlet pressure. This may be interpreted as meaning the net head pressure in a <b>close</b> <b>circuit,</b> {{at the beginning of a}} stroke cycle, is always zero. Therefore, inductive pumps may be used in very high pressure closed circuits to circulate liquids at very low differential pressures. Essentially the inductive pump does not have to overcome the closed system pressure in order to move liquid in the system. This results in far less use of energy to move liquid with the circuit. This also provides additional circulation without any dynamic seals that could eventually leek to the outside of the system.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} explain the {{principle}} of the EPM, the configuration on the following picture is presented. Two permanent magnets are assembled with two U-shape (horseshoe) iron bars. If the north pole of both magnets are pointing up we will have the configuration described on the left: The iron U in the top will see two norths on its ends and will concentrate the flux lines but it won't be able to contain the magnetic flux and the flux will flow through the air and will try to find the other iron U. In a general schema, the iron U on top will become a north pole of the big magnet and the bottom iron U will become a south pole. In this configuration we can say there is big magnet ON. If we rotate one of the hard magnets (north pole point down), the iron U on top will see a north pole and a south pole. The other iron U will see exactly the opposite. In this way almost all the magnetic flux will be concentrated inside both iron U's creating a <b>close</b> <b>circuit</b> for the magnetic field (because the high permeability of the iron). Having all the flux confined inside the structure, the magnetic flux outside became almost nonexistent. In this configuration we can say the big magnet is OFF.|$|E
