2500|$|The {{roots of}} the word shame are thought to derive from an older word meaning [...] "to cover"; as such, {{covering}} oneself, literally or figuratively, is a natural expression of shame. Nineteenth-century scientist Charles Darwin, in his book The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, described shame affect as consisting of blushing, <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind,</b> downward cast eyes, slack posture, and lowered head, and he noted observations of shame affect in human populations worldwide. [...] He also noted the sense of warmth or heat (associated with the vasodilation of the face and skin) occurring in intense shame. Shame can also result in crying.|$|E

60|$|Just as {{the train}} was {{on the point of}} starting, two elderly gentlemen came on the platform, in that eager haste and <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> {{characteristic}} of late passengers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why don't I go in at it?" [...] said Ontario, {{closing the}} book in hopeless <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> and figures. [...] "I'd give every pair of boots in this place, I'd give all the business, to get a kind word from her." ...|$|E
6000|$|How amusing Richardson {{always was}} about Fielding! How jealousy, spite, and the <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> that befogs a prig {{when he is}} not taken seriously, do darken the eyes of the author of [...] "those deplorably tedious lamentations, 'Clarissa' and 'Sir Charles Grandison,'" [...] as Horace Walpole calls them! ...|$|E
50|$|Another type of Yao Grass grew at Taishi Mountain: {{this type}} when used {{produced}} an affect of mental clarity, preventing <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> the <b>mind.</b> This type {{was similar to}} the Atractylodes, with white flowers and black fruits.|$|R
60|$|Another Marjorie in the <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> her <b>mind</b> {{was doing}} her sincerest, narrow best to {{appreciate}} and feel grateful for {{and return the}} devotion of Mr. Magnet. This Marjorie accepted and even elaborated his views, laid stress on his voluntary subjection, harped upon his goodness, brought her to kiss him.|$|R
60|$|After one dreadful moment <b>of</b> <b>confusion,</b> her <b>mind</b> {{realised}} {{the outrage}} {{implied in the}} stealing and reading of her letter.|$|R
60|$|From the {{intimate}} sympathy which {{exists between the}} capillary circulation of {{the surface of the}} head and of the brain, whenever there is intense blushing, there will be some, and often great, <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind.</b> This is frequently accompanied by awkward movements, and sometimes by the involuntary twitching of certain muscles.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{mean for}} any {{individual}} exponent of the equivocal art: mark the guilty conscience, mark the rising blush, mark the <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind!</b> I mean the old sign one knew you best by; your permanent stall at the Français, your inveterate attendance at premières, {{the way you}} 'follow' the young talents and the old." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had thought}} that when Uncle William died {{there would have been}} long {{accounts}} of him in the papers; at least I couldn't help thinking so, by a sort of <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind,</b> as it is hard to get used to things as they are and to remember that our other life is unknown here and that we are known only as ourselves.|$|E
6000|$|But the {{finishing}} stroke yet remained {{which was to}} complete the utter <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> his <b>mind.</b> For before he had gone fifty yards up the street, his little friend of the fruit-basket, whom {{he had not seen}} since he vanished under the feet of the mob in the gateway of the theatre, clutched him by the arm, and burst forth, breathless with running-- ...|$|R
60|$|The sudden {{arrival of}} {{orders for the}} {{regiment}} to repair to the Continent completed the <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> his <b>mind.</b> He remained {{for a short time}} in a state of the most painful irresolution; he hesitated to communicate the tidings until the day for marching was at hand, when he gave her the intelligence in the course of an evening ramble.|$|R
60|$|For {{some little}} way farther he {{struggled}} forward through the forest; but {{what with the}} pain of his wounds, {{the darkness of the}} night, and the extreme uneasiness and <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> his <b>mind,</b> he soon became equally unable to guide himself or to continue to push through the close undergrowth, and he was fain at length to sit down and lean his back against a tree.|$|R
60|$|He had not risen, but he {{accompanied}} {{his words}} {{with a smile}} and a slight but courteous inclination of the head. Partly from the smile, partly from the strange musical murmur with which the Sire prefaced his observation, Denis felt a strong shudder of disgust go through his marrow. And what with disgust and honest <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind,</b> he could scarcely get words together in reply.|$|E
6000|$|Clementina did {{not sleep}} till well toward morning, {{and she was}} still {{sleeping}} when Mrs. Atwell knocked and called in to her that her brother Jim wanted to see her. She hurried down, and in the <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> left over from the night before she cooed sweetly at Jim {{as if he had been}} Mr. Gregory, [...] "What is it, Jim? What do you want me for?" ...|$|E
60|$|Either from a <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> {{incident}} to sensitive and imaginative persons on such occasions, {{or from a}} real want of surgical science, which last is extremely probable, he failed in his examination, and was rejected as unqualified. The effect of such a rejection was to disqualify him for every branch of public service, though he might have claimed a re-examination, after the interval of a few months devoted to further study. Such a re-examination he never attempted, nor did he ever communicate his discomfiture to any of his friends.|$|E
60|$|It {{was enough}} to inform Aline that Mme. de Plougastel's errand must be akin to her own. At the moment, in the general {{distress}} and <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> her <b>mind,</b> her mental vision focussed entirely on the one vital point, she found in this no matter for astonishment. The singular regard conceived by Mme. de Plougastel for Andre-Louis seemed to her then a sufficient explanation.|$|R
60|$|In {{the midst}} of this scene <b>of</b> blood and <b>confusion,</b> the {{presence}} <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> Quentin suggested to him that this dignitary might have the means of protecting their retreat. He raised him on his feet, and asked him if he was wounded.|$|R
6000|$|The next day, as I {{sat in my}} place, I became {{conscious}} {{there was}} some one standing near; and behold, it was herself! I kept my seat, at first in the <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> my <b>mind,</b> later on from policy; and she stood, and leaned a little over me, as in pity. She was very still and timid; her voice was low. Did I suffer in my captivity? she asked me. Had I to complain of any hardship? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, very well,' {{answered}} the seaman; 'exceedingly well--like a tight ship in a brisk gale. Let me recollect. I remember thanking Jack, very composedly, for the interesting and agreeable communication; I then {{pulled out my}} canvas pouch, with my hoard of moidores, and taking out two pieces, I bid Jack keep the rest till I came back, as I was for a cruise about Auld Reekie. The poor devil looked anxiously, but I shook him by the hand, and ran downstairs, in such <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind,</b> that notwithstanding what I had heard, I expected to meet Jess at every turning.|$|E
60|$|At {{the same}} time the {{vividness}} of dreams among certain savages, as recorded in Mr. Im Thurn's 'Indians of Guiana,' and the consequent confusion of dreaming and waking experiences, are certain facts. Wilson says the same of some negroes, and Mr. Spencer illustrates from the <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> in dreamy children. They, we know, are much more addicted to somnambulism than grown-up people. I am unaware that spontaneous somnambulism among savages has been studied as it ought to be. I have demonstrated, however, that very low savages can and do draw an essential distinction between sleeping and waking hallucinations.|$|E
60|$|In {{about two}} hours he {{discovered}} that he was lost. Then came the usual <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> and the hurry to get somewhere. Mexico was anxious to redeem the situation, twisting with alacrity along the tortuous labyrinths of the jungle. At the moment his master's sureness of the route had failed his horse had divined the fact. There were no hills now that they could climb to obtain {{a view of the}} country. They came upon a few, but so dense and interlaced was the brush that scarcely could a rabbit penetrate the mass. They were in the great, lonely thicket of the Frio bottoms.|$|E
60|$|It {{emerged from}} the <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> Lady Harman's <b>mind</b> that perhaps she had better go to the nursery, and see how things were getting on there. Sir Isaac watched her {{departure}} with a slightly dubious eye, made little noises with his teeth for a time, and then went towards the telephone.|$|R
6000|$|They set out accordingly, and {{performed}} {{the second part}} of their journey with more deliberation, and of course more easily, than the first hasty commencement. This gave them leisure for reflection; and Janet now, for the first time, ventured to ask her lady which way she proposed to direct her flight. Receiving no immediate answer--for, perhaps, in the <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> her <b>mind</b> this very obvious subject of deliberation had not occurred to the Countess---Janet ventured to add, [...] "Probably to your father's house, where you are sure of safety and protection?" ...|$|R
60|$|So {{our hero}} stood stunned and bedazed, gazing down upon his victim, {{like a man}} turned into a stone. His brain {{appeared}} to him to expand like a bubble, the blood surged and bummed in his ears with every gigantic beat of his heart, his vision swam, and his trembling hands were bedewed with a cold and repugnant sweat. The dead figure upon the floor at his feet gazed {{at him with a}} wide, glassy stare, and in the <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> his <b>mind</b> it appeared to Jonathan that he was, indeed, a murderer.|$|R
60|$|In her {{distress}} and <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> Miss Garth {{was incapable of}} reasoning with herself, as she might have reasoned at a happier time. She hastened to the antechamber of Mrs. Vanstone's room; and, after explaining Mr. Pendril's position toward the family, placed his letter {{in the hands of}} the medical men. They both answered, without hesitation, to the same purpose. Mrs. Vanstone's condition rendered any such interview as the lawyer desired a total impossibility. If she rallied from her present prostration, Miss Garth should be at once informed of the improvement. In the meantime, the answer to Mr. Pendril might be conveyed in one word--Impossible.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the early}} days things went well enough. The natives sold land without clearly {{understanding}} the terms of exchange, and the whites bought it without being much disturbed about the native's <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind.</b> But by and by the Maori began to comprehend {{that he was being}} wronged; then there was trouble, for he was not the man to swallow a wrong and go aside and cry about it. He had the Tasmanian's spirit and endurance, and a notable share of military science besides; and so he rose against the oppressor, did this gallant [...] "fanatic," [...] and started a war that was not brought to a definite end until more than a generation had sped.|$|E
6000|$|It {{affected}} him on {{the spot}} as a move in a game, and he was even then not without the sense that that wasn't the way Jeanne should be married. But he quickly showed his interest, though--as quickly afterwards struck him--with an absurd <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind.</b> [...] "'You'? You and--a--not Chad?" [...] Of course it was the child's father who made the 'we,' but to the child's father {{it would have cost}} him an effort to allude. Yet didn't it seem the next minute that Monsieur de Vionnet was after all not in question?--since she had gone on {{to say that it was}} indeed to Chad she referred and that he had been in the whole matter kindness itself.|$|E
50|$|The {{power of}} love shared in {{goodness}} for the other, and the perversion of love, {{in the hands}} of one who does not understand this, is a major theme. The perversion is shown in the <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> the <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> Brother Urien, consumed by the passion of love, seeking his own needs and not those of the one he purports to love, from the wife who left him to the young brothers in the Abbey he approaches. The power of love shared {{for the benefit of the}} loved one is shown in many characters, including Brother Fidelis, Nicholas, Hugh and his wife Aline, Brother Ruhn, and always, Brother Cadfael.|$|R
60|$|Arthur {{emerged from}} his hiding-place, horror-struck at hearing {{what was being said}} about him, and wondering, so far as he was at the moment capable of {{accurate}} thought, how long this report had been going about, and whether by any chance it had reached the ears of the Bellamys. If it had, the mischief might be very serious. In the <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> his <b>mind,</b> only two things were clear to him--one was, that both for Mildred's and his own sake, he must leave Madeira at once; and, secondly, that he would dance no more with her that night.|$|R
60|$|Presently, {{with the}} feeling of one who walks in a {{pleasant}} dream from which he fears to awake, and whose delight is mingled with wonder and with uncertainty, Julian Peveril found himself seated between Alice Bridgenorth and her father--the being he most loved on earth, and the person whom he had ever considered as the great obstacle to their intercourse. The <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> his <b>mind</b> was such, that he could scarcely reply to the importunate civilities of Dame Deborah; who, seated with them at table in her quality of governante, now dispensed the good things which had been prepared under her own eye.|$|R
