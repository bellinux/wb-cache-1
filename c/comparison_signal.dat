When jamming is strong enough, the radar receiver can detect it from a relatively low gain sidelobe. The radar, however, will process signals {{as if they were}} received in the main lobe.

40|$|While {{there is}} a growing body of {{functional}} magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) evidence implicating a corpus of brain regions in value-based decision-making in humans, the limited temporal resolution of fMRI cannot address the relative temporal precedence of different brain regions in decision-making. To address this question, we adopted a computational model-based approach to electroencephalography (EEG) data acquired during a simple binary choice task. fMRI data were also acquired from the same participants for source localization. Post-decision value signals emerged 200 ms post-stimulus in a predominantly posterior source {{in the vicinity of the}} intraparietal sulcus and posterior temporal lobe cortex, alongside a weaker anterior locus. The signal then shifted to a predominantly anterior locus 850 ms following the trial onset, localized to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex. <b>Comparison</b> <b>signals</b> between unchosen and chosen options emerged late in the trial at 1050 ms in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, suggesting that such <b>comparison</b> <b>signals</b> may not be directly associated with the decision itself but rather may play a role in post-decision action selection.

40|$|AbstractElectrical devices play an {{increasingly}} {{important role in the}} control of tachyarrhythmias. Antitachycardia pacing and automatic defibrillation have been severely limited by the poor specificity of tachycardia discrimination in commercially available devices. Although absolute heart rate has been the principal means of automatic diagnosis, several new detection algorithms and methods are being investigated. Multiple electrode timing <b>comparison,</b> <b>signal</b> processing and pattern recognition are employed in these newer techniques. Although each offers some improvement over present technology, none is capable of identifying all arrhythmias. The methods employing comparison of atrial and ventricular rates, without additional criteria, are unable to detect ventricular tachycardia in the presence of 1 : 1 retrograde conduction. Electrographic analysis techniques require very stable electrodes and may not tolerate normal morphologic variations. A combination of two or more approaches may ultimately be required. All techniques will require that certain critical variables be programmable to allow for individualization in each clinical situation. Software-controllable devices and those capable of sensing from both the atria and the ventricles will provide the sophistication necessary for the implementation of complex tachycardia detection algorithms.

40|$|The {{importance}} of spectral cues in size discrimination of transient signals was investigated, {{and a model}} for this ability, tAIM, was created based on the biological principles of human hearing. A psychophysics experiment involving 40 participants found {{that the most important}} cue for size discrimination of transient signals, created by striking different sizes of polystyrene spheres, was similar to that of speakers listening to vowels – the relative positions of the resonances between <b>comparison</b> <b>signals.</b> It was found possible to scale the sphere signals in order to confuse listeners into believing the signal source was a different size, but two methods of scaling signals in order to sound the same size as another proved inconclusive, suggesting the possibility that transient signals cannot be scaled in a linear fashion as has been shown possible for vowels. Filtering the signals {{in a number of different}} ways found that the most important cue in size discrimination of transient signals is the difference between the most prominent resonances available in the spectra of the <b>comparison</b> <b>signals.</b> A model of the auditory system using the dynamic compressive Gammachirp filterbank, and based on the well-known AIM, was created to produce auditory images of transient signals that could be normalised for size. Transient-AIM, or tAIM used the Mellin transform to produce images that showed size normalisation was possible due to the spectral envelope similarities across the sizes of the spheres. tAIM was extended to carry out size discrimination of the spheres using the information contained within the Mellin images.

40|$|Acoustic echo {{cancellation}} {{is an attractive}} way to enhance speech quality and provide a full-duplex communication channel for hands-free telephony. Among the many implementation challenges, the problem of "double talk" {{is considered one of}} the toughest. When near-end speech and the acoustic echo of the far-end speech are simultaneously present in the microphone signal, it is very difficult to separate these two components and provide satisfactory echo attenuation. After providing a thorough overview of the application and the major adaptive filtering algorithms used in {{echo cancellation}}, this thesis presents an in-depth study of the published techniques for dealing with double talk. We classify these existing approaches according to their underlying methodology, such as signal level <b>comparison,</b> <b>signal</b> correlation, weight progression monitoring, and dual filter architecture. The strengths and weaknesses of a number of representative algorithms are discussed in some detail. We argue that detection of echo path changes yields a more robust echo canceller than direct double talk detection. The major contribution of this thesis is the development of a novel variable step size approach that uses a measure of the correlation between successive gradient estimates to control the system's adaptation rate. Two main algorithms, denoted GC-VSS 3 and PC-VSS, are derived by applying this approach to the Least Mean Squares and Affine Projection algorithms, respectively. We demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithms in a double talk environment. This is done through a series of simulation experiments using white noise, coloured noise, and recorded speech as the input signals. We also show how an auxiliary double talk detector, based on the proposed variable step size technique, may be employed to control the peripheral echo suppression components that are usually required in a hands-free telephone set. Finally, computational complexity is analyzed and shown to be reasonable for practical implementation when certain beneficial properties of the adaptive filter structure are exploited...|$|E
40|$|Making good {{decisions}} and adapting flexibly to environmental change {{are critical to}} the survival of animals. In this thesis, I investigated neural mechanisms underlying suboptimal decision making in humans and underlying behavioural adaptation in monkeys with the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in both species. In recent decades, in the neuroscience of decision making, there has been a prominent focus on binary decisions. Whether the presence of an additional third option could have an impact on behaviour and neural signals has been largely overlooked. I designed an experiment in which decisions were made between two options {{in the presence of a}} third option. A biophysical model simulation made surprising predictions that more suboptimal decisions were made in the presence of a very poor third alternative. Subsequent human behavioural testing showed consistent results with these predictions. In the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), I found that a value <b>comparison</b> <b>signal</b> that is critical for decision making became weaker in the presence of a poor value third option. The effect contrasts with another prominent potential mechanism during multi-alternative decision making – divisive normalization – the signatures of which were observed in the posterior parietal cortex. It has long been thought that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and amygdala mediate reward-guided behavioural adaptation. However, this viewpoint has been recently challenged. I recorded whole brain activity in macaques using fMRI while they performed an object discrimination reversal task over multiple testing sessions. I identified a lateral OFC (lOFC) region in which activity predicted adaptive win-stay/lose-shift behaviour. In contrast, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity predicted future exploratory decisions regardless of reward outcome. Amygdala and lOFC activity was more strongly coupled for adaptive choice shifting and decoupled for task irrelevant reward memory. Day-to-day fluctuations in signals and signal coupling were correlated with day-to-day fluctuations in performance. These data demonstrate OFC, ACC, and amygdala each make unique contributions to flexible behaviour and credit assignment. This thesis is not currently available on ORA...|$|E
