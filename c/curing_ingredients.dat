40|$|ABSTRACT A {{series of}} {{experiments}} showed that acceptable cured/smoked poultry could be produced with cure times less than 50 hours when sodium nitrite and ascorbic acid {{were included in the}} cure solution. Although turkeys fed a 2000 kcal. M. E. finishing ration were smaller than those fed 3000 kcal. or an N. R. C. stepdown ration, there were no differences in percent eviscerated yield, percent change in weight after curing or percent cooked yield. Higher concentrations of salt and nitrite were found in the thigh meat than the breast meat. The low energy diet birds had the largest amount of salt and nitrite in the breast when compared to the high energy and step down diet. Smaller birds, while having no significant differences in weight after curing, were found to have a larger concentration of salt and better color development when compared to larger birds for the same duration of <b>cure.</b> Adequate <b>cure</b> <b>ingredient</b> absorption was obtained with 16 to 32 hours of curing by soaking with broiler chickens.

The aims {{of this study}} were to investigate composition of spices and saltpeter added, characteristic, total phenolic, and antioxidant activity of commercial dendeng. This research was conducted through interview with some dendeng producers to get information about saltpeter adding and spices composition used in their products. Then the interview results were verified by laboratory analysis. The results showed that spices and saltpeter adding from some producers varied. The saltpeter added in curing process produced inconsistent red color on commercial dendeng in this investigation. Total phenolic of dendeng from producers ranged from 42. 47 to 102. 0 mg GAE/ 100 g DM for raw dendeng, and 36. 51 to 95. 49 mg GAE/ 100 g DM for fried dendeng. Antioxidant capacity against DPPH ranged from 79. 35 to 379. 40 mg VCE/ 100 g DM for raw dendeng, and 94. 30 to 559. 40 mg VCE/ 100 g DM for fried dendeng.

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Food pathogens are of great public health significance, but the spoilage bacteria cause tremendous loss to the food industry. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the effectiveness of selected bioprotectants on the quality and microbial characteristics of vacuum-packaged turkey sausage at 4 ⁰C over a period of 14 days. The bioprotectant used in this study was MicroGARD[TM] 510 (MG 510) which is essentially cultured dextrose and MicroGARD[TM] 300 (MG 300) which is cultured skim milk. Finely comminuted sausages were made with typical <b>curing</b> and seasoning <b>ingredients</b> and seven treatments were created using MG 510 and MG 300 at concentrations of 0. 2 %, 0. 3 %, 0. 45 % and 0. 4 %, 0. 7 % and 0. 9 %, respectively, plus one control without bioprotectant treatment. The sausages were cooked, vacuum packaged, and stored in a refrigerator at 4 ⁰C for evaluation at 0, 7 and 14 days. Samples were tested for pH, water holding capacity, a[w] [subscript], color, texture profile, puncture resistance and microbial content. The microbial analysis was done by plating on yeast and mold (YM) agar, MRS media, and plate count agar (PCA) to determine the effectiveness of the treatments. The log reduction values due to cooking were significant (P [lesser than] 0. 05) for all the treatments. Additionally, there was a significant day of storage difference for log reduction values for all three microbiological measurements. The higher the concentration of bioprotectants used, the more the deviation from the control values. The log reduction was not dependent on the concentration of bioprotectants used for YM and PCA media. The highest concentrations of each MicroGARD[TM] product caused some minor changes in quality attributes but may be effective in reducing bacterial populations for up to two weeks after cooking and vacuum packaging turkey sausage products...|$|R

The age of the bird and maturity of the fruit were considered for the best organoleptic quality of chicken ham. In this study, the combine injection and dry cure (CIDC) method of the conventional formula was adopted. The desired amount of QP crude extract was first determined for the pump pickle. Curing salt was used for the control while different volume of pineapple crude extract was used in two treatments. The protocols for processing native chicken were developed using slaughter native chicken, and QP crude extract as curing ingredient for ham making. Color, flavor, juiciness and tenderness were among the desirable characteristics considered in this study. The sensory evaluation by trained panelists on QP-cured ham samples demonstrated comparable results. All the cooked meat samples were apparently acceptable to the sensory panel. The mean scores for flavor, juiciness and tenderness of meat samples have slight differences; however, they are not statistically significant. Indeed, native chicken can be processed into palatable ham with queen pineapple (Formosa variety) extract that served as curing ingredient, flavor enhancer and tenderizer.

40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} {{for the development of}} ready-to-eat Vawksa rep (smoked pork product) and to study the synergistic effect of <b>curing</b> <b>ingredients</b> and vacuum packaging on the physico-chemical and storage quality during refrigerated storage at (4 °C± 1 °C) for 15 days. Materials and Methods: Four different batches of Vawksa rep samples were prepared, i. e., T- 1 (uncured, first cooked at 121 °C for 15 min, and then smoked at 120 °C for 30 min), T- 2 (uncured, cooked, and smoked simultaneously at 120 °C for 45 min), T- 3 (cured, first cooked at 121 °C for 15 min, and then smoked at 120 °C for 30 min), and T- 4 (cured, cooked, and smoked simultaneously at 120 °C for 45 min). Results: Cooking yield was significantly higher (p< 0. 05) for the T- 4. The pH of T- 3 and T- 4 samples was significantly higher (p< 0. 05) on day 15. The tyrosine value of all the samples increased significantly (p< 0. 05) among the different days of analysis. Thiobarbituric acid value was significantly (p< 0. 05) lower in T- 3 sample both at the beginning {{and at the end of}} storage period. In microbiological profile, total plate count was lower in T- 3 and T- 4 than T- 1 and T- 2. However, Escherichia coli count was negative for T- 3 and T- 4 samples throughout the storage period.

40|$|Compared to carbon black, {{the use of}} silica as {{reinforcing}} filler for rubber results in lower hysteretic losses, for tyre applications leading to lower rolling resistance and consequently fuel savings. The compatibility of hydrophilic silica with a hydrophobic rubber polymer matrix is generally poor. Adding bi-functional coupling agents to the compounds, commonly bis(triethoxysilylpropyl) tetrasulphide (TESPT), enhances filler-matrix compatibility. The degree of hydrophobation of silica during rubber mixing then depends on many mutually interacting factors. Irreproducible conditions during mixing and vulcanisation are major causes of irreproducibility of silica-reinforced rubber compounds. Depending on the chemical composition of the coupling agent, the ultimate temperature obtained during the mixing process {{turns out to be}} the main factor governing the reactions of the coupling agent: the formation of a proper bond between the silica and the coupling agent, while avoiding a premature reaction with the rubber polymers, leading to premature scorch during mixing. Further, the mechanistic aspects of the reaction of various coupling agents, variants on TESPT, are covered, with silica as well as with the rubber. Of great importance are: the carbon and sulphur chain-lengths within the coupling agents, whether corrections are applied in the compound with elemental sulphur relative to the sulphur contained in the reference TESPT, and the moments the correcting amounts of sulphur are added to the compounds: during the first mixing stage, or together with the <b>curing</b> <b>ingredients</b> later-on in the process. The tensile properties of the vulcanised compounds are most prominently influenced. This is indicative of the dual role of sulphur: on the one hand as direct curative, on the other hand as part of the coupling agent becoming attached to the rubber polymers...|$|E
40|$|Research {{represented}} {{in this work}} {{is an attempt to}} improve an efficiency of electrostatic harvesters. In such type of devices mechanical energy conversion to electrical energy is achieved through deformation of insulator (dielectric) layer between plates of charged capacitor. As a result of such deformation the capacitance of the capacitor is decreased and voltage between plates increased and, thus, charge of the capacitor can be stored at higher than initial voltage. To increase the change of voltage during the deformation of dielectric layer between capacitor plates, the use of elastic dielectric with variable dielectric constant is needed. The dielectric constant of such a dielectric should decrease with increasing distance between capacitor plates, i. e., with tensile deformation of dielectric layer. As a candidate for such a dielectric material polymer/nanostructured carbon (PNC) composite was chosen. Capacitor samples containing PNC dielectric layer were elaborated from 1) SWR- 3 L natural rubber with added <b>curing</b> <b>ingredients</b> (this is used as a matrix); 2) high structure Degussa™ Printex™ EX- 2 carbon black with average particle size 30 nm (filler); 3) two brass electrodes (thickness 2 mm). Brass electrodes were tightly attached to PNC composites during vulcanization (T = 150 0 C, t= 15 min, p = 3 MPa). Diameter of samples is 18 mm, thickness is one millimeter. The concentration of filler in PNC composite was chosen to be slightly lower than percolation threshold. Tensile and compressive deformation of samples was realised using Zwick/Roell Z 2. 5 universal material testing machine. Measurements of dielectric constant were carried out on Agilent E 4980 A LCR meter. Tensile and compressive deformation measurements conducted on PNC samples showed, that under tensile and compressive deformation dielectric constant of PNC composite is changing non monotonically (Fig. 1.). The decrease of the dielectric constant with increasing deformation of the dielectric layer can be seen. It can also be seen, that character of dielectric constant change for both - tensile and compressive deformation - is different. The change of dielectric properties observed indicates about complex processes taking place in the PNC dielectric layer...|$|E
40|$|In {{some recent}} reports authors {{have shown that}} the {{embedding}} of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in an insulating polymer matrix such as polycarbonate (PC) dramatically enhances the infrared (IR) photoresponse - the rise of electrical conductivity - of (SWCNTs) [1]. Authors stated that existence of tunnelling resistance of nanotube – polymer – nanotube (CNTP-CNT) junctions plays a dominant role in the photoresponse enhancement and described the electrical conductivity by a thermal fluctuation-induced tunnelling (TFIT) model [2] adapted to CNT-P-CNT junctions in PC matrix [1] In this work we found and described an opposite effect (to the previously mentioned photoresponse effect) in polyisoprene/nanographite composites (PNC) where the electrical resistivity rises under the influence of laser radiation (photo-thermal resistivity response (PTRR)). The PNC composites were prepared as follows. High structure extra-conductive carbon black consisting of 0 D carbon polyhedrons with graphitic panes (nanographite) was dispersed in SWR- 3 L natural rubber together with <b>curing</b> <b>ingredients.</b> The composition was vulcanized (323 K, 3 MPa, 15 min) using Rondol TM hot press. The PNC resistivity increase with the incident light intensity demonstrates a linear relationship. To find out the mechanism of this PTRR effect the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity of the PNC samples was investigated. All composites exhibit a negative temperature coefficient of resistivity (NTCR) at low temperature and show a positive temperature coefficient of resistivity (PTCR) above approximately 280 K. Coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the PNC samples was measured to explain the coexistence of both NTCR and PTCR in the same sample in different temperature regions. We proved that the decrease of tunnelling currents between nanographite aggregates with increasing temperature plays the main role in the conductivity mechanism of the PNC composites in the rubbery phase of the polymer matrix. However in our case the TFIT model is not applicable because of the large CTE of the polyisoprene matrix (in comparison with the CTE of nanographite) which causes sufficient broadening of the tunnelling junctions in the composite with increasing temperature and a subsequent exponential rise of resistivity. A numerical model of temperature dependence of electrical resistivity of PNC with PTCR has been developed...|$|E
