500|$|In the song, Jackson {{tells the}} media to stop {{pressuring}} him and to stop misrepresenting the truth. Jon Pareles of The New York Times observed, [...] "fear has turned to aggression. The music has polarized; it's either clipped, choppy and electronic or glossy and sumptuous, only occasionally trying to combine the two. Most of the time, Jackson sounds as if he's singing through <b>clenched</b> <b>teeth,</b> spitting out words in defiance of any and all persecutors". He believed that [...] "Scream" [...] had a similar sound {{to the music of}} Janet's acclaimed Rhythm Nation. It was Michael Jackson's first song that contained the word [...] "fucking" [...] in the lyrics [...] "Stop pressuring me/Stop pressuring me/Stop fucking with me"—which was thought of as an unusual choice for Jackson, considering his appeal with the younger audience. Other songs on HIStory contained words such as kike, shit, and from The Notorious B.I.G., the word [...] "nigga". [...] "Scream" [...] incorporates elements of pop, R, hip-hop, funk and rock.|$|E
2500|$|In 1950, {{realizing that}} {{alcoholism}} {{had made it}} impossible for her to function as an artist, Barnes stopped drinking in order to begin work on her verse play The Antiphon. The play drew heavily on her own family history, and the writing was fueled by anger; she said, [...] "I wrote The Antiphon with <b>clenched</b> <b>teeth,</b> and I noted that my handwriting was as savage as a dagger." [...] When he read the play, her brother Thurn accused her of wanting [...] "revenge for something long dead and to be forgotten". Barnes, in the margin of his letter, described her motive as [...] "justice", and next to [...] "dead" [...] she inscribed, [...] "not dead." ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>Clenching</b> the <b>teeth</b> is {{generally}} displayed by humans {{and other animals}} as a display of anger, hostility or frustration. It is thought that in humans, <b>clenching</b> the <b>teeth</b> may be an evolutionary instinct to display teeth as weapons, thereby threatening a rival or a predator. The phrase [...] "to grit one's teeth" [...] is the grinding or <b>clenching</b> of the <b>teeth</b> in anger, or to accept a difficult or unpleasant situation {{and deal with it}} in a determined way.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Biology, 2011 Historically human {{olfaction}} {{has been}} underestimated. There is considerable recent evidence that olfaction is biologically important {{in social and}} emotional contexts, including mate selection and kin recognition. Observations of humans in social contexts show that some humans sniff while <b>clenching</b> their <b>teeth.</b> This study documented the prevalence of this behavior in a surveyed population and investigated the physiological aspects of this behavior in a distinct population. The airflow, duration and volume of a sniff were measured while sniffing and <b>teeth</b> <b>clenching</b> and during sniffing alone. In the surveyed population 13 % reported <b>clenching</b> their <b>teeth</b> while sniffing others in social contexts, 18 % in familial contexts and 14 % in sexual contexts. Physiologically, sniffing while <b>teeth</b> <b>clenching</b> resulted {{in an increase in}} airflow for 52 % of the population, while 43 % experienced an increase when sniffing alone. It appears some humans display this behavior, which may enhance olfactory perception by increasing the airflow of the sniff...|$|R

50|$|In 1872. Charles Darwin {{published}} a book “The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals”. He compared numerous images of humans and animals in different emotional states and suggested that some basic emotions, like anger, fear and sadness, are universal and present across ethnicities, cultures and even species. According to Darwin facial expressions were inborn (not learned) and common to humans and animals (some human characteristics like <b>clenching</b> <b>teeth</b> in anger or tears in eyes when sad have animal origin).|$|R
