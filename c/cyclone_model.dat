5|$|A second {{competing}} {{theory for}} extratropical cyclone development over the oceans is the Shapiro-Keyser model, developed in 1990. Its main {{differences with the}} Norwegian <b>Cyclone</b> <b>Model</b> are the fracture of the cold front, treating warm-type occlusions and warm fronts as the same, and allowing the cold front to progress through the warm sector perpendicular to the warm front. This model was based on oceanic cyclones and their frontal structure, as seen in surface observations and in previous projects which used aircraft to determine the vertical structure of fronts across the northwest Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|A warm {{seclusion}} is {{the mature}} {{phase of the}} extratropical cyclone lifecycle. This was conceptualized after the ERICA field experiment of the late 1980s, which produced observations of intense marine cyclones that indicated an anomalously warm low-level thermal structure, secluded (or surrounded) by a bent-back warm front and a coincident chevron-shaped band of intense surface winds. The Norwegian <b>Cyclone</b> <b>Model,</b> as developed by the Bergen School of Meteorology, largely observed cyclones {{at the tail end}} of their lifecycle and used the term occlusion to identify the decaying stages.|$|E
5|$|Of the two {{theories}} on extratropical cyclone structure and life cycle, the older is the Norwegian <b>Cyclone</b> <b>Model,</b> developed during World War I. In this theory, cyclones develop {{as they move}} up and along a frontal boundary, eventually occluding and reaching a barotropically cold environment. It was developed completely from surface-based weather observations, including descriptions of clouds found near frontal boundaries. This theory still retains merit, {{as it is a}} good description for extratropical cyclones over continental landmasses.|$|E

5|$|The first weather maps in the 19th {{century were}} drawn {{well after the}} fact to help devise a theory on storm systems. After {{the advent of the}} telegraph, {{simultaneous}} surface weather observations became possible for the first time, and beginning in the late 1840s, the Smithsonian Institution became the first organization to draw real-time surface analyses. Use of surface analyses began first in the United States, spreading worldwide during the 1870s. Use of the Norwegian <b>cyclone</b> <b>model</b> for frontal analysis began in the late 1910s across Europe, with its use finally spreading to the United States during World War II.|$|E
25|$|In 1494, Christopher Columbus {{experienced}} a tropical cyclone, {{which led to}} the first written European account of a hurricane. In 1686, Edmund Halley presented a systematic study of the trade winds and monsoons and identified solar heating as the cause of atmospheric motions. In 1735, an ideal explanation of global circulation through study of the trade winds was written by George Hadley. In 1743, when Benjamin Franklin was prevented from seeing a lunar eclipse by a hurricane, he decided that cyclones move in a contrary manner to the winds at their periphery. Understanding the kinematics of how exactly the rotation of the Earth affects airflow was partial at first. Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis published a paper in 1835 on the energy yield of machines with rotating parts, such as waterwheels. In 1856, William Ferrel proposed the existence of a circulation cell in the mid-latitudes, and the air within deflected by the Coriolis force resulting in the prevailing westerly winds. Late in the 19th century, the motion of air masses along isobars was understood {{to be the result of}} the large-scale interaction of the pressure gradient force and the deflecting force. By 1912, this deflecting force was named the Coriolis effect. Just after World War I, a group of meteorologists in Norway led by Vilhelm Bjerknes developed the Norwegian <b>cyclone</b> <b>model</b> that explains the generation, intensification and ultimate decay (the life cycle) of mid-latitude cyclones, and introduced the idea of fronts, that is, sharply defined boundaries between air masses. The group included Carl-Gustaf Rossby (who was the first to explain the large scale atmospheric flow in terms of fluid dynamics), Tor Bergeron (who first determined how rain forms) and Jacob Bjerknes.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{introduction}} of the Norwegian <b>cyclone</b> <b>model</b> just after World War I, the United States did not formally analyze fronts on surface analyses until August 1, 1941, just before the WBAN Analysis Center opened in downtown Washington, D.C.. [...] The effort to automate map plotting began in the United States in 1969, with the process complete in the 1970s. [...] Hong Kong completed their process of automated surface plotting by 1987. [...] By 1999, computer systems and software had finally become sophisticated enough to allow for the ability to underlay [...] on the same workstation satellite imagery, radar imagery, and model-derived fields such as atmospheric thickness and frontogenesis in combination with surface observations to make for the best possible surface analysis. [...] In the United States, this development was achieved when Intergraph workstations were replaced by n-AWIPS workstations.|$|E
5|$|Tropical cyclone {{forecasting}} also {{relies on}} {{data provided by}} numerical weather models. Three main classes of tropical <b>cyclone</b> guidance <b>models</b> exist: Statistical models are based on an analysis of storm behavior using climatology, and correlate a storm's position and date to produce a forecast that {{is not based on}} the physics of the atmosphere at the time. Dynamical models are numerical models that solve the governing equations of fluid flow in the atmosphere; they are based on the same principles as other limited-area numerical weather prediction models but may include special computational techniques such as refined spatial domains that move along with the <b>cyclone.</b> <b>Models</b> that use elements of both approaches are called statistical-dynamical models.|$|R
40|$|The flow {{behavior}} in hydrocyclones is extremely complex, leading the designers {{to rely on}} empirical equations for predicting cyclone performance. A number of classifying <b>cyclone</b> <b>models</b> have been developed and used in mineral comminution circuit simulators in the past. The problem with these empirical <b>cyclone</b> <b>models</b> is that they cannot be used outside the range of conditions under which they were developed. A semi-mechanistic hydrocyclone model is developed using the dimensionless approach based on both the fluid mechanics concepts from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations and {{the wide range of}} industrial cyclone performance data. The improved model consist a set of equations for the water split to underflow (R), reduced cut-size (d), throughput (Q) and sharpness of the separation (Î±). The model for R, d, Q gives a very good fit to the data. The alpha model shows reasonable correlation for the cyclone design and operating conditions. Additional data sets were used to validate the new hydrocyclone model by comparing the predictions of the model equations with the experimental results...|$|R

500|$|The {{history of}} surface weather {{analysis}} concerns the timetable of developments related to surface weather analysis. [...] Initially {{a tool of}} study for the behavior of storms, surface weather analyses became {{a work in progress}} to explain current weather and as an aid for short term weather forecasting. Initial efforts to create surface weather analyses began in the mid-19th century by using surface weather observations to analyze isobars, isotherms, and display temperature and cloud cover. By the mid-20th century, much more information was being placed upon the station models plotted on weather maps and surface fronts, per the Norwegian <b>cyclone</b> <b>model,</b> were being analyzed worldwide. Eventually, observation plotting went from a manual exercise to an automated task for computers and plotters. Surface analysis remains a manual and partially subjective exercise, whether it be via hand and paper, or via a workstation.|$|E
500|$|The weather {{data was}} at first less useful {{as a result of}} the {{different}} times at which weather observations were made. The first attempts at time standardization took hold in Great Britain by 1855. The entire United States did not finally come under the influence of time zones until 1905, when Detroit finally established standard time. Other countries followed the lead of the United States in taking simultaneous weather observations, starting in 1873. [...] Other countries then began preparing surface analyses. The use of frontal zones on weather maps did not appear until the introduction of the Norwegian <b>cyclone</b> <b>model</b> in the late 1910s, despite Loomis' earlier attempt at a similar notion in 1841. Since the leading edge of air mass changes bore resemblance to the military fronts of World War I, the term [...] "front" [...] came into use to represent these lines.|$|E

[...] Beginning in 1930, radiofax broadcasts of weather information and forecasts were broadcast for use by ships at sea, emanating from the United States military and the United States Weather Bureau on a cooperative basis. [...] Starting in 1935, Weather Bureau/National Weather Service weather maps were published in newspapers via the Associated Press in a slightly processed format as Wirephoto weather maps.|$|E

[...] Recent advances in both the fields of meteorology and geographic information systems have made it possible to devise finely tailored weather maps. Weather information can quickly be matched to relevant geographical detail. For instance, icing conditions can be mapped onto the road network. This will likely continue to lead to changes in the way surface analyses are created and displayed over the next several years.

40|$|Due to {{relatively}} {{small amount of}} in situ data available for the open oceans, particularly during extreme events, remote sensing techniques take {{an important role in}} the retrieval of geophysical information under such conditions. Up to now the only remote sensing system capable of providing two dimensional sea state information on a global and continuous scale is the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Is well known that ocean waves play {{an important role in the}} dynamics of extreme events like tropical or extratropical cyclones by conditioning the air/sea fluxes of momentum, heat and moisture. In this study data set of ERS- 2 SAR images âimagetteâ is used to study extreme wind and wave conditions in hurricane cases. SAR images of 10 by 5 km size are acquired in Wave Mode every 200 km along the orbit over all oceans providing about 1200 measurements daily. The data set has been reprocessed as single look complex images using the DLR BSAR processor. A homogeneity test is applied to the imagettes to detect data takes which are affected by atmospheric features, e. g., rain cells. The imagettes are then calibrated using I/Q channel standard deviation, as imagettes acquired in high wind conditions are particularly affected by power loss. The retrieved radar cross section is used in combination with collocated ERS- 2 Scatterometer data to derive wind speed and direction. Ocean wave parameters are computed for this dataset using the empirical CWAVE approach (Schulz-Stellenfleth et al., this issue). The work focuses on some illustrative case studies, e. g., Hurricanes Floyd and Gert in the North Atlantic in September 1999. Comparisons of the SAR retrieved parameters with parametric Holland type <b>cyclone</b> <b>models</b> are performed. Observed deviations between SAR measurements and model parameters are discussed. A strategy to apply the method on a statistical basis to improve parametric <b>cyclone</b> <b>models</b> is presented. ...|$|R
