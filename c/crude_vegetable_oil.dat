In 1962 he started to corner the market for soybean oil, used in salad dressing. In the aftermath, investors (51 banks) learned that he had bilked them out of about $175 million in total ($1.2 billion in year 2000 dollars).

5000|$|The scandal {{involved}} the company Allied <b>Crude</b> <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Oil</b> in New Jersey, led by Anthony [...] "Tino" [...] De Angelis, a former commodities broker {{who had been}} in trouble previously for providing the federal school lunch program with poorly prepared meat. Despite this, he was able to obtain a contract with Food for Peace, a federal program which sold excess food stocks to poor countries. De Angelis discovered that he could obtain loans based upon the company's supposed inventory of salad oil.Ships apparently full of salad oil would arrive at the docks, and inspectors would confirm that the ships were indeed full of oil, allowing the company to obtain millions in loans. In reality, the ships were mostly filled with water, with only a few feet of salad oil on top. Since the oil floated on top of the water, it appeared to inspectors that these ships were loaded with oil. The company even transferred oil between different tanks while entertaining the inspectors at lunch. In all, Allied claimed to have 1.8 billion pounds of soybean oil, when it actually only had 110 million pounds. The claimed inventory was the basis for the company raising $180 million from investors.|$|E

Crude vegetable oils contain various minor substances like phospholipids, coloring pigments, and free fatty acids (FFA) that may affect quality of the oil. Reduction of energy costs and waste disposal are major concerns for many oil refiners who are looking for alternative methods to improve conventional refining methods. During the last decade, energy efficient membrane separation technology has evolved dramatically. This thesis reports a study on degumming <b>crude</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> using membrane separation. In the bench-scale study, two membranes were evaluated for their flux and rejection properties. Process parameters including pressure, temperature, feed velocity and volumetric concentration factor were examined. A 99. 6 % rejection of phospholipids and a flux of 22. 4 LMH were achieved at pressure 300 psi, temperature 40 'C and feed velocity 220 1 /hr using DS- 7 membrane, and significant reduction of the coloring pigments was observed as well. In the pilot-scale study, the spiral wound DS- 7 membrane was found effective for 100 % rejection of phospholipids with a permeate flux of 57. 6 LMH. The rejection rates of phospholipids, Mg and Ca were 100 %, 99. 6 % and 54. 6 %, respectively. Resistance-in-series model of the membrane system was also studied. The membrane resistance, the fouling resistance, and the polarization resistance for the pilotscale system were 0. 29, 0. 043, and 4. 49, respectively. Evaluation on membrane fouling and cleaning showed that flux decreased rapidly during the first several hours and membrane cleaning presented no significant problem. The pilot-scale study confirmed results of the bench-scale system and provides useful data for commercializing membrane refining process in the near future.

40|$|AbstractGum {{removal from}} <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> applied for diesel fuel is an {{essential}} process, since the presence of gum in direct use to the diesel engine might cause plugging in the engine filters, lines and injectors. In the biodiesel production, the use of <b>crude</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> without degumming might decrease conversion rate and hard to separate glycerol from biodiesel, during and after trans-esterification reaction respectively. Ultrafiltration is potential technology for degumming of <b>crude</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils,</b> however since the oil constituents have nearly close molecular weight, the membrane degumming process is a difficult process. In {{order to understand the}} membrane degumming process in corn-oil, both experimental and computational works have been conducted. Dry degumming process of corn-oil has been carried out using a tubular ceramic membrane, and the effects of process conditions (temperature, trans-membrane pressure, cross flow velocity) and concentration polarization were investigated. Computational fluid dynamics simulation based on Galerkin finite element methods (FEM) has been carried out and used to predict the retention layer occurred during inside-out operation of membrane degumming. The numerical results show that the increasing of crossflow velocity lead to increase axial Reynolds number, {{and on the other hand}} decrease the thickness of the retention layer. In the x/R= 1. 0 position, the retention layer thicknesses were δp= 4. 0 x 10 - 4 m and δp= 1. 7 x 10 - 4 m, for Re= 1000 and Re= 10000, respectively. Moreover, the effect of increasing Schmidt number gives a significant retention layer thickness decline, i. e. from δp= 4. 8 x 10 - 4 m to δp= 2. 2 x 10 - 4 m, by using Sc= 4 x 105 to Sc= 1. 3 x 106, respectively.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a brief review {{on the current}} status of biodiesel production and its performance and emission characteristics as compression ignition engine fuel. This study is based on the reports on biodiesel fuel published in the current literature by different researchers. Biodiesel can be produced from <b>crude</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil,</b> non-edible oil, waste frying oil, animal tallow and also from algae by a chemical process called transesterification. Biodiesel is also called methyl or ethyl ester of the corresponding feedstocks from which it has been produced. Biodiesel is completely miscible with diesel oil, thus allowing the use of blends of petro-diesel and biodiesel in any percentage. Presently, biodiesel is blended with mineral diesel and used as fuel. Biodiesel fueled CI engines perform more or less {{in the same way as}} that fueled with the mineral fuel.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{unfavourable}} characteristics of <b>crude</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> when used as the fuel is the high viscosity. To improve this weakness, oil can be blended with mineral diesel or biodiesel fuels. This {{study was designed to}} evaluate how the use of mineral diesel or biodiesel blend with cold pressed rapeseed (Brassica napus) oil affects the engine power, torque and fuel consumption. A tractor equipped with direct injection, water cooling system and three-cylinder diesel engine was used for the experiment. Fuels used were standard diesel fuel (diesel), rapeseed oil methyl ester - biodiesel (B 100) and their mixtures with 10, 30 and 50 vol. % of cold pressed rapeseed oil (RO). Increased portion of RO in diesel fuel blends had almost no effect on the torque measured on the tractor PTO shaft; it however decreased the maximal power. Fuel blends with B 100 and rising RO content (up to 50 %) gave a positive correlation with maximal torque and power. By increasing the portion of RO from 0 to 50 %, the minimal specific fuel consumption increased by 6. 65 % with diesel and decreased by 2. 98 % with B 100 based fuel...|$|E

50|$|Another big {{attraction}} {{with the}} hot-bulb engine was {{its ability to}} run {{on a wide range}} of fuels.

40|$|The {{traditional}} quality characteristics for refined <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> {{focus on}} a bland taste, a light colour and a good oxidative stability. Currently, an increased interest is observed for functional minor components naturally present in oils and fats performing a beneficial nutritional effect. Refining of <b>crude</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> involving degumming, bleaching and deodorisation has a high influence {{on the content of}} functional minor components. In this study the difference of chemical versus physical refining will be studied. Especially the reduction of the tocopherol content in refined oil is mainly due to oxidation of the tocopherol. Also the content of sterols in free and esterified form is changing during the various stages of refining. As the economic value of physical deodoriser distillates is much lower compared to chemical distillates an improved deodorization technology to increase the quality of physical deodoriser distillates by condensation of the distillate in two separate fractions was developed. Free fatty acids distillated in the initial stages of the deodorization process are collected in a first distillate, followed by a condensation of tocopherols and phytosterols in a second distillate with a high economic value. The fractionated distillation of free fatty acids and tocopherols / phytosterols was achieved by optimisation of the deodorization temperature profile...|$|R

The sound levels produced by PBJB 5 and PBJB 10 were also reduced by 2. 5 % and 5 % compared with diesel fuel due to their lubricity and damping characteristics...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} is aimed {{to investigate the}} feasibility of using palm (PB), mustard (MB) and Calophyllum biodiesel (CB) as renewable and alternative fuels. Biodiesels were produced from the respective <b>crude</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> and physicochemical properties of the biodiesel-diesel blends were graphically compared for all possible biodiesel blends at every 10 % composition interval. By applying the curve-fitting method, equations were developed for predicting important properties, which show very close fit to the experimental data. This will help future research such as the optimization of blending percentage, engine combustion and performance and emission analysis. As up to 20 % blends of biodiesels showed similar properties to diesel fuel, the engine performance and emission of the 10 % and 20 % biodiesel-diesel blends were studied for all three feedstocks, as well as diesel fuel, to perform a comparative study. An average of 7 - 12 % BSFC increment was observed for biodiesel blends compared to diesel fuel. The brake power was decreased on average of 4. 1 - 7. 7 % while operating on the biodiesel blends. Nitric oxide (NO) emission increased 9 - 17 % and hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide (CO) emission showed improved results for the biodiesel blends. An average of 23 - 43 % lower HC and 45 - 68 % lower CO emission resulted from the biodiesel blends compared to those from diesel fuel...|$|R
40|$|Bio-based oil was {{recently}} explored {{as an alternative}} solution for petroleum-based oil. This {{is due to the}} negative impact of petroleum-based oil to humans and environment. However, few disadvantages make the bio-based oil from <b>crude</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> impractical to be implemented as the industrial lubricant. In this study, the crude jatropha oil was chemically modified via transesterification process in order to develop a machining lubricant so called modified jatropha oil (MJO). Afterward, MJO was blended with micro particle of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) as an additive at various percentage ratio compositions. The mixture between the MJO and additive produces the lubricant sample namely MJ 05 a. MJ 05 b and MJ 05 c. The modification process was crucially needed to enhance the lubricant properties. The friction and wear measurement were carried out on the prepared lubricants by using four ball tribotester. An experimental on orthogonal cutting process was carried out to evaluate the machining performances in terms of cutting force, cutting temperature, chip thickness and tool chip contact length. All samples were compared with commercially synthetic ester (SE). The results reveal that the addition of micro particles additive in the MJO outperformed the SE in terms of friction and wear. Furthermore, the machining performances were significantly related to the tribological behaviour of the lubricant. The small composition of hBN additive in MJO (MJ 05 a) showed an excellent machining performance compared to all lubricants. It was inferred that the Ml 05 a were able to have better anti-fiction and anti-wear ability by reducing the machining force and temperature which related to the formation of smaller chip thickness and tool chip contact length. It shows that MJ 05 a can be considered as an effective machining lubricant that provides superior lubrication properties and hibological behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Use of {{vegetable}} oil as {{compression ignition engine}} fuel has been investigated by many researchers during last decade either by direct blending with diesel or converting it into bio-diesel but very few publications available regarding its direct use in engine. The direct use of straight vegetable oil leading to formation of injector deposits which in turn produces higher exhaust emissions. Fuel improvement through additive is an attractive option in existing diesel engine without any modification to meet worldwide legislative efforts to lower airborne pollution. Hence, use of locally available vegetable oil with addition of fuel additive in existing diesel engine becomes an indispensable tool in global trade to meet ever-tightening pollutant emissions regulations for heavy-duty diesel engine. This paper intends to compare the behaviour of edible and non-edible <b>crude</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> on engine characteristics of existing diesel engine under similar operating condition with cognitive elaboration. The main {{purpose of the present}} work was to investigate how commercially available fuel additives for diesel fuel, influence the edible and non-edible vegetable oil, by comparing the combustion, emission and performance characteristics under similar operating condition. A comparative study was carried out on Cummins two cylinder DI diesel engine at constant speed by varying brake load. The Sunflower oil (SF) was selected as edible oil and Karanj oil (KO) as non-edible oil whereas two commercially available fuel additives for diesel referred as 'A 1 ' and 'A 2 ' respectively in this study were procured for test trial. The experimentally obtained results revealed that both edible oil (SF) and non-edible oil (MO) showed longer ignition delay which in turn leading to higher cylinder pressure, HRR, higher NOx and CO emissions whereas showed lower BSEC and smoke opacity as compared to diesel fuel. However, the KO oil exhibited lower NOx, and CO emissions when compared to SF while maintaining marginal difference in thermal efficiency. The test results showed that both additives were found effective in reduction of ignition delay, HRR and NO formation with KO whereas increased NOx and CO emissions with SF. The additive Al significantly reduced CO and smoke emissions with MO while the opposite trend was observed when additive A 2 was used. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{economic}} feasibility for large-scale biomass production from soybeans or switchgrass from a region in Argentina. This is determined, firstly, by estimating whether the potential supply of biomass, when food and feed demand are met, is sufficient under different scenarios to 2030. On a national level, switchgrass has a biomass potential of 99 × 106 (1. 9 EJ) to 243 × 106 tdm (4. 5 EJ) /year depending on the scenario. Soybean (<b>crude</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> content) production for bioenergy has a potential of 7. 1 × 106 (0. 25 EJ) to 13. 8 × 106 tdm (0. 5 EJ) /year depending on the scenario. The most suitable region (La Pampa province) to cultivate energy crop production is selected based on a defined set of criteria (available land for biomass production, available potential for both crops, proximity of logistics and limited risk of land use competition). The available potential for bioenergy in La Pampa ranges from 1. 2 × 105 to 1. 8 × 105 tdm/year for soybean production (based on vegetable oil content) and from 6. 3 × 106 to 18. 2 × 106 tdm/year for switchgrass production, depending on the scenario. Bioenergy chains for large-scale biomass production for export or for local use are further defined to analyse the economic performance. In this study, switchgrass is converted to pellets for power generation in the Netherlands or for local heating in Argentina. Soybeans are used for biodiesel production for export or for local use. Switchgrass cultivation costs range from 33 – 91 US$/tdm (1 € = 1. 47 US$ based on 19 February 2008). Pellet production costs are 58 – 143 US$/tdm for local use and 150 – 296 US$/tdm until delivery at the harbour of Rotterdam. Total conversion costs for electricity in the Netherlands from switchgrass pellets range from 0. 06 – 0. 08 US$/kWh. Heating costs in Argentina from switchgrass pellets range from 0. 02 – 0. 04 US$/kWh. Soybean cultivation costs range from 182 – 501 US$/tdm depending on the scenario. Biodiesel production costs are 0. 3 – 1. 2 US$/l for local use and 0. 5 – 1. 7 US$/l after export to the Netherlands. Key parameters for the economic performance of the bioenergy chains in La Pampa province are transport costs, cultivation costs, pre-processing and conversion costs and costs for fossil fuels and agricultural commodities...|$|E
40|$|Texto completo: acesso restrito. p. 2670 – 2674 In Brazil, and {{mainly in}} the State of Bahia, <b>crude</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> are widely used in the {{preparation}} of food. Street stalls, restaurants and canteens make a great use of palm oil and soybean oil. There is also some use of castor oil, which is widely cultivated in the Sertão Region (within the State of Bahia), and widely applied in industry. This massive use in food preparation leads to a huge amount of waste oil of different types, which needs either to be properly disposed of, or recovered. At the Laboratorio Energia e Gas-LEN (Energy & Gas lab.) of the Universidade Federal da Bahia, a cycle of experiments were carried out to evaluate the recovery of waste oils for biodiesel production. The experiences were carried out on a laboratory scale and, in a semi-industrial pilot plant using waste oils of different qualities. In the transesterification process, applied waste <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> were reacted with methanol with the support of a basic catalyst, such as NaOH or KOH. The conversion rate settled at between 81 % and 85 % (in weight). The most suitable molar ratio of waste oils to alcohol was 1 : 6, and the amount of catalyst required was 0. 5 % (of the weight of the incoming oil), in the case of NaOH, and 1 %, in case of KOH. The quality of the biodiesel produced was tested to determine the final product quality. The parameters analyzed were the acid value, kinematic viscosity, monoglycerides, diglycerides, triglycerides, free glycerine, total glycerine, clearness; the conversion yield of the process was also evaluated...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we offer}} a general {{equilibrium}} {{analysis of the}} impacts of US and EU biofuel mandates for the global livestock sector. Our simulation boosts biofuel production in the US and EU from 2006 levels to mandated 2015 levels. We show that mandates will encourage crop production in both biofuel and non biofuel producing regions, while reducing livestock and livestock production in most regions of the world. The non-ruminant industry curtails its production more than other livestock industries. The numerical {{results suggest that the}} biofuel mandates reduce food production in most regions while they increase <b>crude</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> in almost all regions. Implementing biofuel mandates in the US and EU will increase croplands within the biofuel and non-biofuel producer regions. A large portion of this increase will be obtained from reduced grazing lands. The biofuel producing regions are expected to reduce their coarse grains exports and raise imports of oilseeds and <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils.</b> While all livestock industries use more biofuel byproducts in their animal feed rations, the dairy and other ruminant industry benefit most from the expansion of DDGS. We finally conclude that, while biofuel mandates have important consequences for the livestock industry, they do not harshly curtail these industries. This is largely due to the important role of byproducts in substituting for higher priced feedstuffs. In addition, with relatively inelastic food demands, producers are able to pass much of the price rise on to consumers. In general, US, EU, Meddle East & North Africa, and Russia will experience significant welfare loses due to the combined US and EU mandates, while Brazil, Japan, India, and East Asia are expected to get major gains.
