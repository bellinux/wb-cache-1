5|$|The {{spectroscopy}} {{of molecular}} oxygen {{is associated with}} the atmospheric processes of aurora and airglow. The absorption in the Herzberg continuum and Schumann–Runge bands in the ultraviolet produces atomic oxygen that is important in the chemistry of the middle atmosphere. Excited state singlet molecular oxygen is responsible for red <b>chemiluminescence</b> in solution.|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescence is the {{production}} and emission of light by a living organism. It {{is a form of}} <b>chemiluminescence.</b> Bioluminescence occurs widely in marine vertebrates and invertebrates, as well as in some fungi, microorganisms including some bioluminescent bacteria and terrestrial invertebrates such as fireflies. In some animals, the light is bacteriogenic, produced by symbiotic organisms such as Vibrio bacteria; in others, it is autogenic, produced by the animals themselves.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{bioluminescence}} {{is caused}} by the action of luciferases, enzymes that produce light by the oxidation of a luciferin (a pigment). Several studies have evaluated the biochemical basis of light production in Panellus stipticus, and concluded that there is no specific fungal luciferase. The fungus was shown in 1988 to contain the sesquiterpene panal, which has a cadinene keto-aldehyde chemical structure. Later, two additional precursors were isolated, PS-A (1-O-decanoylpanal) and PS-B (1-O-dodecanoylpanal). If these compounds are treated with salt of ammonia or primary amines in the presence of iron(II), hydrogen peroxide, and a cationic surfactant, light is emitted by a <b>chemiluminescence</b> reaction, suggesting that panal and its derivatives are fungal luciferins, and that the <b>chemiluminescence</b> reaction is the cause of in vivo bioluminescence. In the fungus, the level of activity of the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) appears to {{play a critical role in}} the amount of light emission. SOD quenches the effect of the superoxide (O2−) anion required in the reaction, and thus SOD activity has to be inhibited for the reaction to occur.|$|E
5|$|The first {{practical}} {{electron microscope}} {{was built by}} the physics department in 1938. During World War II, the university developed the G-suit, a life-saving garment worn by Allied fighter plane pilots, later adopted for use by astronauts. Development of the infrared <b>chemiluminescence</b> technique improved analyses of energy behaviours in chemical reactions. In 1963, the asteroid 2104 Toronto is discovered in the David Dunlap Observatory in Richmond Hill and is named after the university. In 1972, studies on Cygnus X-1 led to {{the publication of the}} first observational evidence proving the existence of black holes. Toronto astronomers have also discovered the Uranian moons of Caliban and Sycorax, the dwarf galaxies of Andromeda I, II and III, and the supernova SN 1987A. A pioneer in computing technology, the university designed and built UTEC, one of the world's first operational computers, and later purchased Ferut, the second commercial computer after UNIVAC I. Multi-touch technology was developed at Toronto, with applications ranging from handheld devices to collaboration walls. The AeroVelo Atlas, which was the first to win the Igor I. Sikorsky Human Powered Helicopter Competition in 2013, was developed by the university's team of students and graduates and was tested in Vaughan.|$|E

25|$|<b>Chemiluminescence</b> {{has been}} applied by {{forensic}} scientists to solve crimes. In this case, they use luminol and hydrogen peroxide. The iron from the blood acts as a catalyst and reacts with the luminol and hydrogen peroxide to produce blue light for about 30 seconds. Because {{only a small amount}} of iron is required for <b>chemiluminescence,</b> trace amounts of blood are sufficient.|$|E
25|$|The 20th century saw the {{invention}} of new ways of creating blue, such as <b>chemiluminescence,</b> making blue light through a chemical reaction.|$|E
25|$|File:Luminol2006.jpg|Vivid blues can {{be created}} by {{chemical}} reactions, called <b>chemiluminescence.</b> This is luminol, a chemical used in crime scene investigations. Luminol glows blue when it contacts even a tiny trace of blood.|$|E
25|$|Since that time, {{phosphors}} and phosphorescence {{were used}} loosely to describe substances that shine {{in the dark}} without burning. Although the term phosphorescence is derived from phosphorus, the reaction that gives phosphorus its glow is properly called <b>chemiluminescence</b> (glowing due to a cold chemical reaction), not phosphorescence (re-emitting light that previously fell onto a substance and excited it).|$|E
25|$|Gas analysis: for {{determining}} {{small amounts of}} impurities or poisons in air. Other compounds can also be determined by this method (ozone, N-oxides, S-compounds). A typical example is NO determination with detection limits down to 1 ppb. Highly specialised <b>chemiluminescence</b> detectors have been used recently to determine concentrations as well as fluxes of NOx with detection limits as low as 5 ppt.|$|E
25|$|The fluorescently labeled probe {{is excited}} by {{light and the}} {{emission}} of the excitation is then detected by a photosensor such as a CCD camera equipped with appropriate emission filters which captures a digital image of the western blot and allows further data analysis such as molecular weight analysis and a quantitative western blot analysis. Fluorescence {{is considered to be}} one of the best methods for quantification but is less sensitive than <b>chemiluminescence.</b>|$|E
25|$|When Polanyi {{moved to}} the University of Toronto, his first {{graduate}} students were looking for enhanced reaction rates with vibrationally excited hydrogen, as well as looking {{for the presence of}} vibrationally excited hydrogen chloride during the exothermic reaction of molecular chlorine with atomic hydrogen. Graduate student Kenneth Cashion was working with Polanyi when they made their first discoveries about <b>chemiluminescence,</b> the light emitted by an atom molecule when it is in an excited state. This work was first published in 1958.|$|E
25|$|The {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay or ELISA is {{a diagnostic}} method for quantitatively or semi-quantitatively determining protein concentrations from blood plasma, serum or cell/tissue extracts in a multi-well plate format (usually 96-wells per plate). Broadly, proteins in solution are adsorbed to ELISA plates. Antibodies specific for the protein of interest are used to probe the plate. Background is minimised by optimising blocking and washing methods (as for IHC), and specificity is ensured via the presence {{of positive and negative}} controls. Detection methods are usually colorimetric or <b>chemiluminescence</b> based.|$|E
25|$|His Nobel victory also {{signaled}} {{a change in}} his research direction. The 1986 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Ernst Ruska, Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer for their work in electron microscopes and scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM). This research piqued Polanyi's interest {{while he was in}} Sweden for the ceremony. After returning to Toronto, Polanyi and his colleagues looked into the technique and now have four STMs, which they use to picture chemical reactions at the molecular level, rather than using infrared detection and <b>chemiluminescence.</b>|$|E
25|$|Except for Bentheuphausia amblyops, krill are bioluminescent animals having organs called photophores {{that can}} emit light. The light is {{generated}} by an enzyme-catalysed <b>chemiluminescence</b> reaction, wherein a luciferin (a kind of pigment) is activated by a luciferase enzyme. Studies indicate that the luciferin of many krill species is a fluorescent tetrapyrrole similar but not identical to dinoflagellate luciferin and that the krill probably do not produce this substance themselves but acquire {{it as part of}} their diet, which contains dinoflagellates. Krill photophores are complex organs with lenses and focusing abilities, and can be rotated by muscles. The precise function of these organs is as yet unknown; possibilities include mating, social interaction or orientation and as a form of counter-illumination camouflage to compensate their shadow against overhead ambient light.|$|E

2500|$|Enhanced <b>chemiluminescence</b> is {{a common}} {{technique}} {{for a variety of}} detection assays in biology. [...] A horseradish peroxidase enzyme (HRP) is tethered to an antibody that specifically recognizes the molecule of interest. [...] This enzyme complex then catalyzes the conversion of the enhanced chemiluminescent substrate into a sensitized reagent {{in the vicinity of the}} molecule of interest, which on further oxidation by hydrogen peroxide, produces a triplet (excited) carbonyl, which emits light when it decays to the singlet carbonyl. [...] Enhanced <b>chemiluminescence</b> allows detection of minute quantities of a biomolecule. Proteins can be detected down to femtomole quantities, well below the detection limit for most assay systems.|$|E
2500|$|Fluorescence is not {{the only}} type of {{luminescence}} achievable in biological systems: <b>Chemiluminescence,</b> the generation of light by means of chemical reactions, is produced by some protein, such as Aqueorin from symbiont in jellyfish and luciferase from symbiont in fireflies. These have been used to make glucose sensors: Daunert makes a -split Aqueorin sensor and Koji Sode in 2009 made [...] -luciferase with Asp459Asn (Glc not Gal).|$|E

2500|$|Radioactive [...] labels do {{not require}} enzyme substrates, but rather, allow the {{placement}} of medical X-ray film directly against the western blot, which develops as it is exposed to the label and creates dark regions which correspond to the protein bands of interest (see image to the right). The importance of radioactive detections methods is declining due to its hazardous radiation , because it is very expensive, health and safety risks are high, and ECL (enhanced <b>chemiluminescence)</b> provides a useful alternative.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{method of}} {{secondary}} antibody detection utilizes a near-infrared (NIR) fluorophore-linked antibody. The light produced from the excitation of a fluorescent dye is static, making fluorescent detection {{a more precise}} and accurate measure {{of the difference in}} the signal produced by labeled antibodies bound to proteins on a western blot. [...] Proteins can be accurately quantified because the signal generated by the different amounts of proteins on the membranes is measured in a static state, as compared to <b>chemiluminescence,</b> in which light is measured in a dynamic state.|$|E
2500|$|Immunocytochemistry, which {{involves}} raising antibodies against targeted {{chemical or biological}} entities, includes a few other techniques of interest. A targeted neurotransmitter could be specifically tagged by primary and secondary antibodies with radioactive labeling {{in order to identify}} the neurotransmitter by [...] autoradiography. The presence of neurotransmitters (though not necessarily the location) can be observed in enzyme-linked immunocytochemistry or enzyme--linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) in which substrate-binding in the enzymatic assays can induce precipitates, fluorophores, or <b>chemiluminescence.</b> In the event that neurotransmitters cannot be histochemically identified, an alternative method is to locate them by their neural uptake mechanisms.|$|E

[...] Polanyi's contributions were centred around the work he did developing the technique of infrared <b>chemiluminescence.</b> This technique was used to measure weak infrared emissions from a newly formed molecule in order to examine energy disposal during a chemical reaction.

2500|$|The first form of {{elemental}} phosphorus {{to be produced}} (white phosphorus, in 1669) emits a faint glow when exposed to oxygen – hence the name, taken from Greek mythology, [...] meaning [...] "light-bearer" [...] (Latin Lucifer), referring to the [...] "Morning Star", the planet Venus (or Mercury). The term [...] "phosphorescence", meaning glow after illumination, originally derives from this property of phosphorus, although this word has since been used for a different physical process that produces a glow.
