5|$|The game's {{score system}} {{is based on}} a {{multiplier}} bar and a hit gauge <b>counter.</b> As the player destroys enemy cores, the hit <b>counter</b> increases. Points awarded for destroyed cores are multiplied by the value of the hit <b>counter.</b> The <b>counter</b> decreases when the player stops destroying cores. However, if the multiplier reaches a certain amount it will begin to flash, awarding large point bonuses for any cores destroyed during this short period of time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Many algorithms, e. g. in {{the field}} of string matching, are based on {{handling}} many <b>counters,</b> which can be performed in parallel, even on a sequential machine, using bit-parallelism. The recently presented technique of nested <b>counters</b> (Matryoshka <b>counters)</b> [1] is to handle small <b>counters</b> most of the time, and refer to larger <b>counters</b> periodically, when the small <b>counters</b> may get full, to prevent overflow. In this work, we present several non-trivial applications of Matryoshka <b>counters</b> in string matching algorithms, improving their worst- or average-case time complexities. The set of problems comprises (δ, α) -matching, matching with k insertions, episode matching, and matching under Levenshtein distance. ...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Counters</b> are {{primarily}} used for counting {{items such as}} cans going into a box on an assembly line. This is important because once something is filled to its max the item needs to be moved on so something else can be filled. Many companies use <b>counters</b> in PLC's to count boxes, count how many feet of something is covered, or to count how many pallets are on a truck. There are three types of <b>counters,</b> Up <b>counters,</b> Down <b>counters,</b> and Up/Down <b>counters.</b> Up <b>counters</b> count up to the preset value, turn on the CTU (CounT Up output) when the preset value is reached, and are cleared upon receiving a reset. Down <b>counters</b> count down from a preset value, turns on the CTD (CounT Down output) when 0 is reached, and are cleared upon reset. Up/Down <b>counters</b> count up on CU, count down on CD, turn on CTUD (CounT Up/Down output) when the preset value is reached, and cleared on reset.|$|R

5|$|With the {{introduction}} of the tank the artillery was no longer required to aid the infantry by destroying obstacles and machine gun positions. Instead, the artillery assisted by neutralising the German artillery with <b>Counter</b> battery fire. British Army researchers under Lieutenant William Lawrence Bragg developed sound ranging, a method of determining the location of hostile artillery from the sound of its guns firing. A <b>Counter</b> Battery Staff Officer (CBSO) was appointed at each corps to co-ordinate the <b>counter</b> battery effort, collating reports from sound ranging and Royal Flying Corps observers. By the end of the war, it was realised that the important effect of the barrage was to demoralise and suppress the enemy, rather than physical destruction; a short, intense bombardment immediately followed by an infantry assault was more effective than the weeks of grinding bombardment used in 1916.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaf [49]) Because of {{the upgrade}} in the accelerator at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, the collider detectors {{also needed to}} be upgraded. In {{the case of the}} D 0 detector, the detector upgrade includes changes to the muon systems. Part of these changes is the addition of scintillation <b>counters</b> to the central muon trigger. These scintillation <b>counters</b> are referred to as the A-phi <b>counters.</b> NIU's contribution to the D 0 upgrade was to construct and test the small A-phi <b>counters.</b> The <b>counters</b> were tested for efficiency and for the location of the signal amplitude peak. The efficiency tests insured that all of the <b>counters</b> were usable on the detector and gave an initial idea of the kind of variation to be expected between <b>counters.</b> The signal amplitude tests were used to quantify the variation between the <b>counters</b> after the installation of the final phototubes. These amplitude tests allow the <b>counters</b> to be placed into installation groups for the purpose of setting HV levels. They also give the information necessary for the initial fine adjustments to the voltage threshold settings for reading the pulses. The HV and threshold adjustments allow the <b>counters</b> to have matched output when installed on the D 0 detector. Matching the outputs of the <b>counters</b> insures that the data taken from the <b>counters</b> will be able to be analyzed and used as trigger data for Run II of the accelerator. M. S.
