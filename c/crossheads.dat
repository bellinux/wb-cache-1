25|$|The locomotive's two {{cylinders}} {{were inside}} the frame and it was equipped with Stephenson valve gear. Its two feedwater pumps were actuated by the piston <b>crossheads.</b> As built, the engine had an open cab, but a cab roof was installed some years later.|$|E
25|$|As {{speeds and}} {{distances}} increased, mechanisms were developed that injected thick mineral {{oil into the}} steam supply. The first, a displacement lubricator, mounted in the cab, uses a controlled stream of steam condensing into a sealed container of oil. Water from the condensed steam displaces the oil into pipes. The apparatus is usually fitted with sight-glasses to confirm the rate of supply. A later method uses a mechanical pump worked {{from one of the}} <b>crossheads.</b> In both cases, the supply of oil is proportional to the speed of the locomotive.|$|E
60|$|Gleams, like pale long flames, trembled {{upon the}} polish of metal; from the {{flooring}} below the enormous crank-heads emerged in their turns with {{a flash of}} brass and steel--going over; while the connecting-rods, big-jointed, like skeleton limbs, seemed to thrust them down and pull them up again with an irresistible precision. And deep in the half-light other rods dodged deliberately to and fro, <b>crossheads</b> nodded, discs of metal rubbed smoothly against each other, slow and gentle, in a commingling of shadows and gleams.|$|E
50|$|A {{piston rod}} is {{attached}} to the piston and links it to the <b>crosshead,</b> which is a large casting sliding in <b>crosshead</b> guides (UK: slidebar), allowing it only to move {{in the same direction as}} the piston travel. The <b>crosshead</b> also houses the gudgeon pin on which the small end of the connecting rod pivots. In this way, the transverse forces are applied only to the <b>crosshead</b> and its bearings, not to the piston itself.|$|R
40|$|LectureReciprocating {{compressors}} {{constructed to}} API- 618 standards find application in refineries, petrochemical plants, and pipelines around the world. These compressors are constructed with a force-fed lubricated <b>crosshead</b> that drives a double-acting piston via a piston rod. Looseness {{in the running}} gear (piston assembly, connecting rod assembly, and <b>crosshead</b> assembly) results in knocks (impulse events) that are usually detected at the <b>crosshead</b> guide with accelerometers and, in some cases, with proximity probes measuring the piston rod vibration at the pressure packing case. <b>Crosshead</b> guide accelerometers have proven successful in detecting and preventing catastrophic failure; however, the alarm set points for the vibration levels have been derived heuristically because no model exists that relates forces and impacts within the running gear to the vibration of the <b>crosshead</b> guide. This paper presents {{a model of the}} <b>crosshead</b> system that estimates the vibration response of the <b>crosshead</b> and <b>crosshead</b> guide in reaction to the forces and impulses in the running gear. The model incorporates the oil-film behavior including non-linear, position-dependent stiffness and damping. The paper also examines the system response in the time domain and the complex plane (eigenvalue migration). The numerical model results are validated by comparison with data acquired on operating machines in known conditions of distress. The results show good agreement between the model and <b>crosshead</b> and piston rod vibration data, both in the timing and amplitude of vibration. Using the results of the model and historical data collected from operating reciprocating compressors the paper concludes with guidelines for filtering of <b>crosshead</b> accelerometer signals and alarm thresholds...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{this research}} is to investigate the effect of <b>crosshead</b> speed on the tensile behavior of the structural steel which is presented in stress-strain diagram. The experiments were carried out by performing tensile testing of specimens with various <b>crosshead</b> speeds. The <b>crosshead</b> speed was determined by a dial position of 0. 2, 0. 5, 1, and 2 on the testing machine. In load-free condition, the dial positions give true speed of the <b>crosshead</b> of 0. 042 mm/s, 0. 27 mm/s, 0. 663 mm/s, and 1. 354 mm/s respectively. The material used in {{this research is}} astructural steel which {{is comparable to the}} standard of DIN ST 37. The result shows that the various <b>crosshead</b> speeds give a different response of the strain rate during the test. The strain rate, whic is resembled by the <b>crosshead</b> speed, begins to increase at the yield point. Also, theultimate stress of the specimens is affected by the <b>crosshead</b> speed. The ultimate stress of the specimens with dial position of 2 increases approximately 25 % from that of with dial position of 0. 2...|$|R

In front, the bright cranks flashed and faded in a shallow pit, the <b>crossheads</b> slammed between their guides and the connecting-rods, shining like silver, swung out of the gloom. Above, the big {{cylinders}} throbbed and shook with the impulse that drove the ship ahead.

2500|$|The <b>crosshead</b> {{engine is}} {{described}} as having a vertical cylinder above the crankshaft, with the piston rod secured to a horizontal <b>crosshead,</b> from each end of which, {{on opposite sides of}} the cylinder, extended a connecting rod which rotated its own separate crankshaft. The <b>crosshead</b> operated within vertical guides that enabled the assembly to maintain the correct path as it moved. The engine's alternative name [...] "A-frame" [...] presumably derived from the shape of the frames supporting these guides. Some <b>crosshead</b> engines had more than one cylinder, in which case the piston rods were usually all connected to the same <b>crosshead.</b> An unusual feature of early examples of this type of engine was the installation of flywheelsgeared to the crankshaftswhich were thought necessary to ensure smooth operation.

40|$|AbstractIn this study, {{the effects}} of <b>crosshead</b> speeds on solder {{strength}} of Cu/Sn– 9 Zn/Cu lap joints were determined. The solder strength of lap joints increased with increasing <b>crosshead</b> speeds. The highest solder strength value obtained was 130. 41 MPa± 4. 85 at <b>crosshead</b> speed 3. 0 mm/min while the lowest was 106. 11 MPa± 5. 20 at 0. 5 mm/min. The corresponding strain value was inversely proportional with increasing <b>crosshead</b> speeds. In every lap joint formed, a constant joint interfacial strength was determined. This particular value is important in determining the failure mode of lap joints under different <b>crosshead</b> speeds. Failure occurred at the solder bulk region when the solder strength obtained was below the joint interfacial strength. Meanwhile, the failure mode transited from the bulk region to the joint interface {{as soon as the}} solder strength was higher than the joint interfacial strength. Fracture analyses were performed at the cross-sections of lap joints to support the statement...|$|R
50|$|A <b>crosshead</b> is a {{mechanism}} used in long reciprocating engines and reciprocating compressors to eliminate sideways {{pressure on the}} piston. Also, the <b>crosshead</b> enables the connecting rod to freely move outside the cylinder. Because of the very small bore-to-stroke ratio on such engines, the connecting rod would hit the cylinder walls and block the engine from rotating if the piston was attached directly to the connecting rod like on trunk engines. Therefore, the longitudinal dimension of the <b>crosshead</b> must be matched to the stroke of the engine.|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinders}} {{drove on}} the second pair of coupled wheels. The locomotives were fitted with the single slide-bar type piston <b>crossheads,</b> popular in Europe but prone to rapid wear under South African conditions. The valve spindle <b>crossheads</b> were screwed {{to the ends of}} the valve spindles and secured with locknuts. Although this made adjustment easier, it was not satisfactory in service and was later replaced by the usual taper fit with cotter pin. With these two exceptions, the mechanical parts of the Class 19 gave very little trouble.|$|E
5000|$|In a steam locomotive, {{the crank}} pins are usually mounted {{directly}} {{on one or}} more pairs of driving wheels, and the axle of these wheels serves as the crankshaft. The connecting rods (also called the main rods in US practice), run between the crank pins and <b>crossheads,</b> where they connect to the piston rods. <b>Crossheads</b> or trunk guides are also used on large diesel engines manufactured for marine service. (The similar rods between driving wheels are called side rods in US practice and coupling rods in British practice.) ...|$|E

50|$|Very large slow-speed {{two-stroke}} diesel engines, such {{as those}} in ships, may have their crankcase as a separate space from the cylinders, or as an open crank. The piston rod is supported by a separate <b>crosshead.</b> The spaces between the piston rod and the <b>crosshead,</b> or the <b>crosshead</b> to the crankshaft, may be largely open for maintenance access. As they are large and their movement is slow, the bearings may be made individually well enough sealed to catch and return the oil from the bearings.|$|R
50|$|<b>Crosshead,</b> 'double crosshead' or 'square' engines were {{vertical}} engines analogous in {{layout to}} the table engine, with their cylinder above the crankshaft. The <b>crosshead</b> needed to be very wide, to allow the connecting rods to pass {{either side of the}} large cylinder, which in turn required a large supporting frame for the slidebars. They were popular for early American riverboats and their large wooden A frame <b>crosshead</b> supports were a distinctive feature. Larger engines became top-heavy and so the design was replaced by steeple or walking beam engines.|$|R

50|$|In {{the case}} of the steam engine, a <b>crosshead</b> is {{essential}} if the engine is to be double acting - steam is applied to both sides of the piston, which requires a seal around the piston rod.

5000|$|<b>Crossheads</b> in a steam {{locomotive}} can be mounted either to one guide mounted above the crosshead or to two, one above and one below (called an alligator crosshead {{since it has}} two [...] "jaws"). The former was preferred in many modern locomotives.|$|E

50|$|Large {{two-stroke}} ship diesels {{are sometimes}} {{made to be}} reversible. Like four-stroke ship engines (some of which are also reversible) they use mechanically operated valves, so require additional camshaft mechanisms.

40|$|In the {{construction}} of post-tensioned segmental <b>crosshead,</b> the stresses in the <b>crosshead</b> vary in every stage of {{the construction}} as the addition of new segment increases the bending moment while post-tensioning of tendon reduces it. Furthermore, the bending moment in the <b>crosshead</b> during construction is not balanced as new segment are added at {{one side of the}} cantilever at a time together with other construction load that operates {{on the same side of}} the new segment. In this paper, a study was conducted with finite element method to investigate the response of various parameters and effect of construction sequences on a segmental <b>crosshead</b> erected by balanced cantilever method. For this operation, a segmental <b>crosshead</b> model was generated using a finite element software and it was analyzed with various construction sequence. The rate of changes in stresses in each stages of construction was investigated and it was found that the stresses were over the limit when construction stage analysis was performed. In addition to that, it was also found that the maximum design moment for pier design can only be obtained by a more rigorous construction stage analysis...|$|R
