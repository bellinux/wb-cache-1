As a consequence, there is agricultural diversification and livelihoods are less dependent on livestock seasonal movement (Nyberg et al. 2015). In Baringo, Laikipia, Marsabit and other drylands in Kenya, 10 tonnes of indigenous perennial grass seeds are distributed and seeded annually. Pastoral groups are reported to generate incomes of about Kshs. 1.5 million per annum, and some pastoral communities engaged in group fodder production take loans worth over Kshs. 750, 000  (approximately USD 7, 353), using privately-rehabilitated fields as collateral (Meyerhoff 2012).|$|R
40|$|Access {{justice is}} one of the most {{appealing}} and least contentious regulatory techniques in law 2 ̆ 7 s repertoire. It aspires to give people equal opportunity to utilize certain primary goods, and it does so by assuring opennessthat access to these goods is not allocated by markets and is not tilted in favor of wealth or privilege. But access justice often fails to meet its egalitarian aspirations, because groups that are not the intended targets of the intervention deploy access and its benefits dispropor tionately. Paradoxically, access justice often benefits various elites while paid for directly by taxpayers and indirectly by weaker groups. This Article brings to light this unintended and regressive crosssubsidy created by policies of access to information, compensation, insurance, accommodations, and more. It then examines in detail a specific contemporary access justice paradoxconsumers 2 ̆ 7 access to courts and the impact of mandatory arbitration agreements that limit such access. This Article demonstrates that access to courts is a franchise of the elite and of little value to weak consumers.

40|$|Fibre {{broadband}} networks are widely presumed {{to become the}} dominant form of fixed-line broadband access. However, the spectre of fibre firms gaining market power, such has been evidenced in legacy copper-based telecommunications networks, has led some policy-makers to suggest imposing separation mandates (either functional or structural) on the owners of fibre networks yet to be built, in order to militate against {{the creation of a}} new set of firms with market power. Whilst conceptually separation of the „dark fibre? data transportation core from network intelligence and retail functions echoes the computer technology-centric view of the internet as a „dumb core? and an „intelligent fringe?, and replicates the separation mandates currently proposed as a means of preventing integrated legacy copper-based providers from foreclosing retail competition, the ensuing structures likely exacerbate the chilling effect of access regulation on network investment observed in most markets where it has been applied. The chilling effects arise because of an investment horizon mismatch (hold-up) between infrastructure operators with large fixed and sunk costs, and retailers (and arguably even end consumers) with freedom to switch between retailers and network infrastructures. The usual resolution to such problems requires customers to make a credible commitment to purchase services via relationship-specific investments or <b>contractual</b> commitments. Whereas <b>access</b> regulation precludes the contractual resolution of the hold-up problem, separation mandates preclude their resolution by consumer-owners vertically integrating upsteam into elements of infrastructure ownership. Consequently, it appears unlikely that the level of investment in separated fibre networks providing dark fibre connections will be optimal. Indeed, under competitive circumstances and high levels of demand uncertainty, there may be no private sector investment forthcoming for dark fibre infrastructures. By examining the business model of CityLink, a firm that since 1995 has been successfully supplying dark fibre in a highly competitive broadband market segment, it is confirmed that long-term financial viability of dark fibre-producing firms is feasible when utilising a mix of both contractual and asset ownership mechanisms that bind end consumers into credible commitments sufficient to justify the firm?s deployment of new network infrastructure capacity. The institutional arrangements that led to the development of this firm?s successful business model draw their inspiration more from the flexible and collaborative commercial interaction of the information technology community rather than the adversarial and prescriptive regulatory environment of the telecommunications industry. It is concluded that if policy-makers wish to encourage the creation of a truly „dark fibre-based? fixed line broadband environment, then in the initial stages of network deployment at least, arrangements similar to those of CityLink are more likely to induce sufficient and timely private sector investments than the rigid and rigorous separation and access regulation arrangements common in the recent history of the telecommunications industry. ...|$|R
40|$|Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) in the Ghanaian {{economy has}} {{increased}} tremendously since 1983 {{when the country}} adopted neo-liberal economic policies. In order {{to take advantage of}} the globalization processes, FDI is represented as a way of increasing capital investments and reducing poverty rates in Ghana. More generally, FDI in agriculture is viewed as an effective poverty reduction tool and a medium for economic growth, especially in rural areas of the developing countries where majority of the world’s peasant farmers live. In an era characterized by an increasing spatial interconnectedness and flows of capital across national borders, FDI has emerged as a development strategy since the 1950 s. However, critics argue that FDI often tend to worsen the poverty situation in developing countries rather than creating any economic improvements. This argument is exemplified by the way investing economies accumulate and transfer wealth out of developing countries without generating many benefit to them. The broad generalization of the outcome of FDI however fails to consider its spatial context and other cultural specificities. Undoubtedly, differences between and within developing countries in terms of economic policies, ecological conditions, political and social systems among others interact with FDI to generate differentiated outcomes. This study focuses on a Norwegian company, Norpalm Ghana Limited (hereafter called Norpalm), that invested in the oil palm industry in Ghana since 2000. Norpalm has cultivated approximately 11, 300 acres of land and adopts a nucleus estate production model that integrates smallholders (oil palm farmers who have <b>contractual</b> agreements to <b>access</b> land, farm inputs, credit from Norpalm and in turn supply their oil palm bunches to them) and outgrowers (oil palm farmers wo do not have contractual agreements with Norpalm and may supply their oil palm bunches to Norpalm based on price incentives). This investment is located in rural farming communities dominated by small-scale farmers who are often constrained by limited access to farmland, farm inputs, and ready markets for their oil palm bunch. As a typical case of FDI in agriculture, this study examines the outcomes of Norpalm’s smallholder and outgrower schemes and the local conditions that account for these outcomes. The specific objectives of the study are to examine 1) the enabling factors for Norpalm’s investment in the oil palm industry in Ghana; 2) the outcomes of Norpalm’s smallholder scheme to the company and the smallholders; 3) the outcomes of Norpalm’s outgrower scheme to the company and the outgrowers; 4) the local conditions that account for the outcomes of these schemes. An analytical framework that defines FDI as consisting of economic capital, actors and knowledge is adopted to analyze the outcomes of Norpalm’s smallholder and outgrower schemes and the local conditions that account for the specific outcomes of the schemes (Fløysand and Barton, 2014). The study takes the post-structuralist approach to development and the concepts of ‘land transactions’, ‘land grabbing’ and ‘contract farming’ to analyze the findings. Using a case study approach, the study uses primary and secondary data sources. Interviews, informal conversations, personal observations and review of secondary data were varied methods that were used to document the enabling factors that led to Norpalm’s investment in the oil palm industry in Ghana and the differentiated outcomes of the schemes for Norpalm, smallholders and outgrowers. The study found that Ghana’s Structural Adjustment Programme; modern oil palm processing technology used by Norpalm and the company’s quest to maximize this technology and increase their market share were the major factors that were conducive for Norpalm’s investment in the oil palm industry in Ghana. Though Norpalm integrated smallholders and outgrowers into its production after acquiring formerly state-owned oil palm company, National Oil Palms Limited, there are differentiated outcomes for the smallholders and outgrowers. The smallholders’ accessed lands, farm inputs, credits, markets for their oil palm bunches and improved farming techniques or knowledge from Norpalm. In most cases, Norpalm in turn recorded an increase in total quantity of oil palm bunches harvested from the smallholders due to a guaranteed supply of oil palm bunches. On the contrary, the outgrowers were unable to access farm inputs, credits, improved farming techniques or knowledge from Norpalm. Consequently, Norpalm experienced a reduction in the supply of oil palm bunches from the outgrowers compared to that of the smallholders. The positive outcome of the smallholder scheme to both Norpalm and smallholders is termed FDI as trickling down effects whereas the outcome of the outgrower scheme to Norpalm and the outgrowers is termed as FDI as backwash effects. The predominantly customary land ownership system in Ghana and the level of farmer-based organizations were local conditions identified to account for the differentiated outcomes of Norpalm’s smallholder and outgrower schemes. The thesis therefore argues that an analysis of outcomes of FDI should go beyond ‘development’ and ‘dependency’ to consider specific local conditions present in the investment environment. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{overall goals}} of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture are food {{security}} and sustainable agriculture. The Treaty entered into force in 2004 and rules on the conservation, sustainable use, and access and benefit-sharing of seeds for food and agriculture. Due to the “special nature” of plant genetic resource for food and agriculture, Contracting Parties to the Treaty consider seed management as a “common concern of all countries”, which necessitates a multilateral regime approach. To this end, they created the multilateral system of access and benefit-sharing of the Treaty. This dissertation analyses the common management system of seeds within the Treaty in order to evaluate if and how the Treaty reaches its set objectives. The research methodology is inspired from transdisciplinarity, and contains three steps. First, a historical and contextual analysis of the international seed management rules is carried out. Second, the treaty is studied in detail following two methods: a legal and a stakeholder analysis of the Treaty and of its implementation instruments. This second step leads to the identification of specific conceptual constraints impeding an effective {{implementation of the treaty}} to reach its objectives. Third, following this double reading of the Treaty, the research results are analyzed in light of the theory of the commons, with the aim to assess if and how the literature on the commons can contribute to help Contracting Parties reach the overall {{goals of the}} Treaty: food security and sustainable agriculture by improving what was qualified as a Global Seed Commons. This last step allowed formulating solutions to the identified constraints. The two main outputs of the thesis are put forward. First, the Treaty lies on a dual discourse where there is a clear will to design an effective global seed commons where seeds would be accessible for all its stakeholders, including smallholder farmers, in order to reach food security and sustainable agriculture, but where practice shows that the seed commons is only effective for researchers and breeders. Second, there is a clear contradiction within the Treaty, between its objectives and the designed obligations to reach them, in particular regarding the limited recognition of Farmers’ Rights at the international level. As it does not mitigate the imbalance of rights opposing smallholder farmers and big agro-chemical multinationals {{on the issue of the}} appropriation of seeds and their related knowledge, the Treaty is not able to reach its objectives. Building on these results, I identify specific underlying principles from the analysis of the global seed commons. These underlying principles should be better expressed in the rules and procedures of the global seed commons in order to mitigate the identified conceptual constraints and contribute to the realization of the Treaty’s overall goals. I plea for a deeper and true global seed commons for all its stakeholders in order to face major social challenges such as producing sufficient and quality food in times of climate changes and persisting world hunger and poverty.
