About 62% of the species and subspecies are endemic, as are 4-6 genera (depending on taxonomic treatment). The lake proper has 115 natives, including 73 endemics (63.5%). Among the more than 50 genera in the lake proper, 3-4 are endemic: Anatirostrum, Caspiomyzon, Chasar (often included in Ponticola) and Hyrcanogobius. By far the most numerous families in the lake proper are gobies (35 species and subspecies), cyprinids (32) and clupeids (22). Two particularly rich genera are Alosa with 18 endemic species/subspecies and Benthophilus with 16 endemic species. Other examples of endemics are four species of <b>Clupeonella,</b> Gobio volgensis, two Rutilus, three Sabanejewia, Stenodus leucichthys, two Salmo, two Mesogobius and three Neogobius.

Studied variables were protein solubilization pH (acid vs. alkaline) and blending step (before or after protein precipitation). Comparisons were made with conventionally washed minces from kilka and silver carp fillets; either alone or after blending. Rheological studies revealed that blending alkali-produced protein isolates before precipitation resulted in rapid increase of G′ reflecting the formation of intermolecular protein-protein interactions with higher rate. Furthermore, blending of alkali-produced protein isolates and washed minces, respectively, of kilka and silver carp improved physico-mechanical properties of the resultant gels compared to pure kilka proteins.

The gonadosomatic index (GSI) for females and males attained maximum values in May {{in the first period}} of sampling and in March-April in the second period, suggesting temporal variations in spawning activity. The pattern of oocyte frequency distribution demonstrated that the common kilka is a batch spawner with group-synchronous oocyte development. The estimated relative batch fecundity was 6718 oocytes g– 1. A low level of atresia (4. 7 %) during the spawning season showed that this species was in optimal somatic condition.

To give {{biological}} {{assessment of}} the commercial stock of tulka <b>Clupeonella</b> cultriventris (Nordmann, 1840) of the Dnieper-Bug estuary system in {{the conditions of the}} reduced Dnieper flow. Methodology. Analysis of the biological state of the tulka stock of the Dnieper-Bug estuary system was performed based on the data on the dynamics of its age structure, linear-weight growth and condition factor.

Field and laboratory processing of the ichthyological materials were performed according to generally accepted methods. Findings. Current commercial fishery situation in the Dnieper-Bug estuary system is characterized by reduced intensity of tulka harvest. Currently, major fish harvest is concentrated in the Mykolaiv fishing ground.

The {{results indicated that the}} protein hydrolysate from Alcalase, had the highest protein content (78. 91 %), protein recovery (80. 42 %) and degree of hydrolysis (21. 06 %). No significant differences in lipid were observed among the enzymes (P> 0. 05). The results of amino acids composition showed that all hydrolysates were almost similar in amino acids composition. In addition, the protein efficiency ratio showed that all hydrolysates had high nutritional value. The chemical score results indicated that all hydrolysates could fulfill human amino acid requirements. While, in comparison with common carp requirements, the amino acids of methionine, lysine, phenyl alanine and threonine were the limiting amino acids in hydrolysates.

40|$|In {{the present}} study changes in {{ecosystems}} of the Black Sea, Caspian Sea and Baltic Sea after the invasion of ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi were investigated. Excessive increase in plant plankton {{as a result of}} antrophogenic eutrophication leads to a shift in mesozooplankton com¬position, which is the main food item of these comb jellies. For instance, while some mesozoo¬plankton species disappeared from the environment or substantially decreased in number, some others increased in quantity. These changes in food chain may promote the rise of jellyfishes rather than fish in the environment. In addition, decrease in planktivorous fish abundance as a consequence of overfishing also triggers the increase of newly introduced comb jellies, which were possibly introduced via ballast waters of ships, in the ecosystem. Increase in abundance of M. leidyi, which compete with planktivorous fishes (anchovy, Engraulis encrasicolus ponticus in the Black Sea, kilka, <b>Clupeonella</b> spp. in the Caspian Sea) for their food, causes to decrease of planktivorous fish stocks which have already been vulnerable due to overfishing. Another reason for successfully adaption of M. leidyi to its new ecosystems could be linked to global warming which provides favourable temperature ranges for reproduction and growth of this ctenophore. Although there are still many debates related to possible negative effects, one of the ways to reduce harmful impacts of invaders might be the transport of natural predators of these invaders to the new ecosystems of invaders. For example, it was reported that the abun¬dance of Mnemiopsis leidyi decreased to very low levels during 1999 - 2004 in the Black Sea following the introduction of another comb jelly, Beroe ovata, which feed on this ctenophore...|$|E
