40|$|Despite recent {{advances}} in neuroimaging, differentiation between <b>cerebral</b> <b>abscesses</b> and necrotic tumors with ring-type contrast enhancement can be puzzling at times. The introduction of advanced imaging techniques, such as diffusion-weighted imaging, {{has contributed to the}} identification of <b>cerebral</b> <b>abscesses.</b> However, differentiation may be impossible with imaging only. In this review the authors evaluate the role of proton magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy in differentiating between <b>cerebral</b> <b>abscesses</b> and necrotic tumors and address the spectral characteristics of intracranial abscesses. A large number of metabolites not detected in the normal brain spectra may be detected and give valuable information regarding the nature of the abscesses. Proton MR spectroscopy is a safe, noninvasive diagnostic modality, which could significantly increase the accuracy and specificity of conventional MR imaging in differentiating between malignant tumors and <b>cerebral</b> <b>abscesses</b> and provide valuable information regarding the cause of an abscess, as well as, its response to the chosen treatment...|$|R
