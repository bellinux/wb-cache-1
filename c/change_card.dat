Typically, three-year-old {{children are}} able to sort cards based on a single dimension, but are unable to switch to sort the cards based on a second dimension. However, five-year-old children are able to sort cards based on one dimension and can then switch to sorting cards on a second dimension.|$|E

Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) {{research has shown}} that specific brain regions are activated when a person engages in cognitive flexibility tasks. These regions include the prefrontal cortex (PFC), basal ganglia, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Studies conducted with people of various ages and with particular deficits have further informed how cognitive flexibility develops and changes within the brain.|$|E

50|$|The {{winner of}} the main game played the Money Cards bonus game {{for a chance to}} win {{additional}} money. The Money Cards board consisted of a series of eight cards (seven in 2001) on three levels. On the 1970s Card Sharks, a contestant was able to <b>change</b> the base <b>card</b> on each of the three levels (originally only the base card {{at the beginning of the}} game). The 1980s series gave the contestant a choice of three pre-dealt cards to use for changes. Contestants were originally allowed to <b>change</b> <b>cards</b> at will (even three times on one card), but the rules were <b>changed</b> to one <b>card</b> per line in early 1986. The 2001 series used the same rules from the 1970s series.|$|R

50|$|Although TPCI {{tries to}} keep Organized Play as equal as {{possible}} all over the Earth, there are some notable differences in how POP is run outside of the United States. The Pokémon Card Laboratory (PCL), located in Japan, is the designer of new cards and the ultimate authority on any matter relating to the Pokémon Trading Card Game. It can declare rulings on any in-game circumstance, issue errata, <b>change</b> <b>card</b> text after publishing, and change the basic game rules, although the latter three rarely occur. PCL runs Organized Play in Japan. The Pokémon Trading Card Game in most European countries is currently handled by The Pokémon Company International. Certain countries have no direct official presence; in these regions, distributors of the game run tournaments. European countries are able to qualify for positions at the Pokémon Trading Card Game World Championships each year, through National Championships and European Rankings.|$|E
40|$|While most 3 -year-olds fail both in {{the false}} belief task of theory of mind and Dimensional <b>Change</b> <b>Card</b> Sorting task of {{cognitive}} control, most 4 -year-olds are able to pass these tasks. Different theories have been constructed to explain this co-development. To investigate {{the direction of the}} developmental relationship between false belief reasoning and cognitive control, Kloo and Perner (2003) trained 3 -year-olds on the false belief task in one condition and on the Dimensional <b>Change</b> <b>Card</b> Sorting task in another condition. They found that there is a mutual transfer between the two tasks, meaning that training children with the Dimensional <b>Change</b> <b>Card</b> Sorting task with feedback significantly improved children's performance on the false belief task and vice versa. In this study, we aim to provide an explanation for the underlying mechanisms of this mutual transfer by constructing computational cognitive models. In contrast to the previous theories, our models show that the common element in the two tasks is two competing strategies, only one of which leads to a correct answer. Providing children with explicit feedback trains them to use a strategy of control instead of using a simpler reactive strategy. Therefore, we propose that children start to pass the false belief and cognitive control tasks once they learn to be flexible in their behavior depending on the current goal...|$|E
40|$|There are {{at least}} two ways in which {{response}} conflict can be handled in the mind: dynamic response conflict resolution, which enables conflicting response demands to be resolved on-line, and discrimination learning, which reduces the amount of on-line response conflict that needs to be resolved in context. While under fours are perfectly capable of discrimination learning, they appear to lack the ability to resolve response conflict online. They can match their behavior to context in remarkably subtle and sensitive ways when they have learned to do so, but if they have not learned to match a response or a behavior to a context, their inability to handle on-line response conflict is their undoing (for example, in the dimensional <b>change</b> <b>card</b> sort task; DCCS). We present an analysis of how discrimination learning in context might aid children’s performance in the dimensional <b>change</b> <b>card</b> sorting (DCCS) over time. In a training study in which three groups of age matched under fours attempt to complete the DCCS we find that, given appropriate discrimination learning, children are able to flexibly switch between the responses required by the DCCS. Without appropriate discrimination learning, children’s performance is far worse, and when the task contexts are novel, children fail as expected...|$|E

50|$|Typically, a CCG is {{initially}} played using a starter deck, or intro deck, {{which has a}} basic complement of cards {{that can be used}} to play the game. This deck may be expanded or modified with cards from booster packs, which contain a random selection of cards of varying rarities, usually between 8 and 15 cards. One of these cards is a rare or unique card that is much harder to obtain than the remaining cards and often has a higher value than the rest. These values can change over time as distribution <b>changes,</b> <b>cards</b> become banned in playing formats, or the metagame is altered by interactions with new cards. Eventually, with enough cards, players may create new decks from scratch.|$|R
