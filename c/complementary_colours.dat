During Van Gogh's stay in Paris between 1886 and 1887, he tried to master a new, lighter palette. His Portrait of Père Tanguy (1887) shows his success with the brighter palette, and is evidence of an evolving personal style. Charles Blanc's treatise on colour interested him greatly, and led him to work with <b>complementary</b> <b>colours.</b> Van Gogh {{came to believe that}} the effect of colour went beyond the descriptive; he said that [...] "colour expresses something in itself". According to Hughes, Van Gogh perceived colour as having a [...] "psychological and moral weight", as exemplified in the garish reds and greens of The Night Cafe, a work he wanted to [...] "express the terrible passions of humanity". Yellow meant the most to him, because it symbolised emotional truth. He used yellow as a symbol for sunlight, life, and God.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{important}} {{influence on}} {{painting in the}} 19th century was the theory of <b>complementary</b> <b>colours,</b> developed by the French chemist Michel Eugene Chevreul in 1828 and published in 1839. He demonstrated that placing <b>complementary</b> <b>colours,</b> such as blue and yellow-orange or ultramarine and yellow, {{next to each other}} heightened the intensity of each colour [...] "to the apogee of their tonality." [...] In 1879 an American physicist, Ogden Rood, published a book charting the <b>complementary</b> <b>colours</b> of each colour in the spectrum. This principle of painting was used by Claude Monet in his Impression – Sunrise – Fog (1872), where he put a vivid blue next to a bright orange sun, (1872) and in Régate à Argenteuil (1872), where he painted an orange sun against blue water. The colours brighten each other. Renoir used the same contrast of cobalt blue water and an orange sun in Canotage sur la Seine (1879–1880). Both Monet and Renoir liked to use pure colours, without any blending.|$|E

60|$|Looking back at {{the great}} round hill from the village it is {{impossible}} not to notice the intense red colour of the road that winds over its green slope. One sometimes sees on a hillside a ploughed field of red earth which at a distance might easily be taken for a field of blossoming trifolium. Viewed nearer the crimson of the clover and red of the earth are very dissimilar; distance appears to intensify the red of the soil and to soften that of the flower until they are very nearly of the same hue. The road at Abbotsbury was near and looked to me more intensely red than any ordinary red earth, and the sight was strangely pleasing. These two <b>complementary</b> <b>colours,</b> red and green, delight us most when seen thus--a little red to {{a good deal of}} green, and the more luminous the red and vivid the green the better they please us. We see this in flowers--in the red geranium, for example--where there is no brown soil below, but green of turf or herbage. I sometimes think the red campions and ragged-robins are our most beautiful wild flowers when the sun shines level on the meadow and they are like crimson flowers among the tall translucent grasses. I remember the joy it was in boyhood in early spring when the flowers were beginning to bloom, when in our gallops over the level grass pampas we came upon a patch of scarlet verbenas. The first sight of the intense blooms scattered all about the turf would make us wild with delight, and throwing ourselves from our ponies we would go down among the flowers to feast on the sight.|$|E
6000|$|Not till {{some time}} in 1895 did I think he could ever drink too much for his sobriety--though what he drank would {{certainly}} {{be too much for}} that of most of the men whom I knew--I no more doubted his self-control, though we were very intimate friends, than I doubted his memories of Cardinal Newman. The discovery that he did was a great shock to me, and, I think, altered my general view of the world. I had, by my friendship with O'Leary, by my fight against Gavan Duffy, drawn the attention of a group of men, who at that time controlled what remained of the old Fenian movement in England and Scotland; and at a moment when an attempt, that came to nothing, was being made to combine once more our constitutional and unconstitutional politics, I had been asked to represent them at some convention in the United States. I went to consult Johnson, whom I found sitting at a table with books about him. I was greatly tempted, because I was promised complete freedom of speech; and I was at the time enraged by some wild articles published by some Irish American newspaper, suggesting the burning down of the houses of Irish landlords. Nine years later I was lecturing in America, and a charming old Irishman came to see me with an interview to write, and we spent, and as I think in entire neglect of his interview, one of the happiest hours I have ever spent, comparing our tales of the Irish fairies, in which he very firmly believed. When he had gone I looked at his card, to discover that he was the writer of that criminal incitement. I told Johnson that if I had a week to decide in I would probably decide to go, but as they had only given me three days, I had refused. He would not hear of my refusal with so much awaiting my condemnation; and that condemnation would be effective with Catholics, for he would find me passages in the Fathers, condemning every kind of political crime, that of the dynamiter and the incendiary especially. I asked how could the Fathers have condemned weapons they had never heard of, but those weapons, he contended, were merely developments of old methods and weapons; they had decided all in principle; but I need not trouble myself about the matter, for he would put into my hands before I sailed the typewritten statement of their doctrine, dealing with the present situation in the utmost detail. He seemed perfectly logical, but a little more confident and impassioned than usual, and I had, I think, promised to accept--when he rose from his chair, took a step towards me in his eagerness, and fell on to the floor; and I saw that he was drunk. From that on, he began to lose control of his life; he shifted from Charlotte Street, where, I think, there was fear that he would overset lamp or candle and burn the house, to Gray's Inn, and from Gray's Inn to old rambling rooms in Lincoln's Inn Fields, and at last one called to find his outer door shut, the milk on the doorstep sour. Sometimes I would urge him to put himself, as Jack Nettleship had done, into an Institute. One day when I had been very urgent, he spoke of [...] "a craving that made every atom of his body cry out" [...] and said the moment after, [...] "I {{do not want to be}} cured," [...] and a moment after that, [...] "In ten years I shall be penniless and shabby, and borrow half-crowns from friends." [...] He seemed to contemplate a vision that gave him pleasure, and now that I look back, I remember that he once said to me that Wilde got, perhaps, an increase of pleasure and excitement from the degradation of that group of beggars and blackmailers where he sought his pathics, and I remember, too, his smile at my surprise, as though he spoke of psychological depths I could never enter. Did the austerity, the melancholy of his thoughts, that spiritual ecstasy which he touched at times, heighten, as <b>complementary</b> <b>colours</b> heighten one another, not only the Vision of Evil, but its fascination? Was it only Villon, or did Dante also feel the fascination of evil, when shown in its horror, and, as it were, judged and lost; and what proud man does not feel temptation strengthened from the certainty that his intellect is not deceived? ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{framework}} of colour preference control to satisfy the consumer’s colour related emotion. A colour harmony algorithm based on two-colour combinations is developed for displaying the images with several <b>complementary</b> <b>colour</b> pairs as the relationship of two-colour combination. The colours of pixels belonging to <b>complementary</b> <b>colour</b> areas in HSV colour space are shifted toward the target hue colours {{and there is no}} colour change for the other pixels. According to the developed technique, dynamic emotions by the proposed hue conversion can be improved and the controlled output image shows improved colour emotions in the preference of the human viewer. The psychophysical experiments are conducted to investigate the optimal model parameters to produce the most pleasant image to the users in the respect of colour emotions...|$|R

5000|$|Regarding painting, blue is the <b>complementary</b> <b>colour</b> to orange. As many {{painters}} of the 19th century discovered, blue and orange reinforce each other.

In another letter he wrote simply, [...] "there is no orange without blue." [...] Van Gogh, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and many other impressionist and post-impressionist painters frequently placed orange against azure or cobalt blue, to make both colours appear brighter.|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{determined}} the effect upon accommodative responses of tinted lenses prescribed for {{the relief of}} visual discomfort {{in a group of}} five long term lens wearers.

While similarity and normality of the mean stimulus–response functions between the four viewing conditions were evident, the low frequency component of the accommodation microfluctuations was significantly greater while viewing the target in the ‘no lens’ viewing condition. These increases in the low frequency components (LFC) of the accommodation may be a subtle indicator of visual stress in these patients. Colour specificity is not supported by this finding...|$|R

50|$|When MOED is {{dissolved}} in various liquids, its colour will vary, {{depending on the}} solvent and its polarity. In general, the more polar the solvent, the shorter the wavelengths of the light absorbed will be. When light of a certain colour (wavelength) is absorbed, the solution {{will appear in the}} <b>complementary</b> <b>colour</b> of the one absorbed. Therefore, in water, a highly polar solvent, MOED appears yellow (corresponding to absorbed blue light of wavelengths 435-480 nm), but is purple or blue (corresponding to absorbed green to yellow light of wavelengths 560-595 nm) in acetone, a less polar solvent. The effect stems in part from the stabilization of the ground state of the merocyanine molecule in polar solvents, which increases the energy gap between the ground state and excited states, which corresponds to shorter wavelengths (increased energy) of the absorbed light.|$|R

40|$|How {{important}} is the visual appeal of food we prepare for ourselves? Perhaps when our health is good the visual appearance of home-prepared meals is of little consequence, {{as long as the}} food tastes good and satisfies our hunger. But if we're not well, then food not only nourishes our body, but also benefits our state of mind by encouraging us to eat. Does strong and varied colour equal perceived flavour, and monotone or lack of colour a lack of flavour? The study addressed the hypotheses that the most visually appetising meals would approximate <b>complementary</b> or triadic <b>colour</b> schemes, and the least appetising meals would relate to monotone or analogous colour schemes. To test this postulation selected students undertook investigations into the colour of meals they prepared. The results confirmed the importance of colour in appetite appeal, but also defined the specifics of colour in relation to culture, and whether the meal was breakfast, lunch or dinner. It seems our expectations vary in this respect. The value of analogous <b>colours</b> plus a <b>complementary</b> <b>colour</b> was recognised while too much colour was seen to be as unappetising as too little colour. A follow-up expanded study reassessed the link between colour and visually appealing meals. The earlier findings were confirmed.
