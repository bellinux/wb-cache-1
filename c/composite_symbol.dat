These structures are implemented using a functional analog of linked lists, but BoltzCONS employs distributed representations and associative retrieval {{in place of}} a conventional memory organization. Associative retrieval leads to some interesting properties. For example, the model can instantaneously access any uniquely-named internal node of a tree. But the point of the work is not to reimplement linked lists in some peculiar new way; it is to show how neural networks can exhibit compositionality and distal access (the ability to reference a complex structure via an abbreviated tag), two properties that distinguish symbol processing from lower-level cognitive functions such as pattern recognition. Unlike certain other neural net models, BoltzCONS represents objects as a collection of superimposed activity patterns rather than as a set of weights. It can therefore create new stuctured objects dynamically, without reliance on iterative training procedures, without rehearsal of previously learned patterns, and without resorting to grandmother cells. 2 ̆...|$|E
40|$|Gyula Krúdy (1878 - 1933) {{produced}} the main {{bulk of his}} fictional work in the period 1897 - 1920, when Modernist writing in Hungary was initially dominated by the short story as the medium of experiment and innovation. The basic form of his prodigious output was, similarly {{to a number of}} other important prose authors of the period, the short story. His highly influential work has an elusive quality: it is unclassifiable, and general critical labels such as Symbolism, Impressionism and Surrealism have been of partial and dubious help in discussions of his writing. Approached from a technical point of view, the underlying narrative strategy of Krúdy's work can be identified as serial accumulation, with its attendant openness of form: the short-story sequence, the story-tagged-on-the-previous-story organisation of his novels, the historically pre-novelistic frame-tale-like coordination of various narrative forms. This is particularly evident in the case of Szindbád, Krúdy's crowning achievement in fiction, which came into being as an ever expanding series of short stories, novels and “dreams”, held together by their protagonist, the symbolically reimagined figure of Sindbad the Sailor, the mythic wanderer of The Arabian Nights. Infused with the lyricism of conjugal Eros and Thanatos, the stories develop, and give variations on, the central character as a <b>composite</b> <b>symbol,</b> the manifold meanings of which range from authorial self-dramatisation to a philosophical vision of Man as metaphysical superfluity...|$|E

40|$|Intuitive {{approaches}} {{to the notion of}} the limit of a function “lim f (x) = l ” or “f(x) → l as x → a” x→a are usually interpreted in a dynamic sense “f(x) gets close to l as x gets close to a. ” The variable quantity x moves closer to a and causes the variable quantity f(x) to get closer to l. As an implied corollary resulting from the examples they do, students often believe (see [5]) that f(x) can never actually reach l. For l = 0 this gives a pre-conceptual notion of “very small ” or “infinitely small. ” A limit is often interpreted as a never-ending process of getting close to the value of l rather than the value of l itself. For instance, using the Leibnizian notation, students with a background of intuitive limiting processes might interpret dx as lim δx→ 0 δx. The latter is not thought of as zero, but the process of getting arbitrarily close to zero. In the same way lim n→ ∞ an is usually regarded as a never-ending process, so that 0 ⋅ 999 K 9 K is regarded as less than 1 because the process never gets there. The extent of these phenomena will depend on the experiences of the students. In a questionnaire for mathematics students arriving at Warwick University, they were asked whether they had met the notation dy δy = lim dx δx→ 0 δx and, if so, they were asked the meaning of the constituent parts δx, δy, dx, dy.

40|$|Attempting {{to assess}} {{the risk of a}} release from a {{potentially}} polluting marine site (PPMS) can be a very subjective process. The Marine Site Risk Index (MaSiRI) is designed to provide a more objective approach to this process by adopting a table-based evaluation scheme, while still allowing for the inevitable unknown conditions by including a subjective ‘expert correction’ in a suitably controlled manner. Building on a geographic database of PPMS records, the MaSiRI algorithm applies data filters to remove PPMS records for which it is not applicable and then estimates a basic risk index based on core data that almost all sites would contain. It can then refine the results for those sites that have auxiliary data, varying the assessed risk as appropriate, according to standard rule-sets. A risk level of confidence is computed and adjusted to express dynamic confidence in the risk value (e. g., due to reliance on estimates rather than measured values), and where appropriate an upper and lower bound of risk can be used {{to assess the}} range of values associated with an estimated parameter. This information can be visualized by a <b>composite</b> quality <b>symbol</b> proposed here.

40|$|The study {{investigated}} the long-term neuropsychological effects of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) due to participation in a contact sport amongst South African final year male high school athletes (N= 189). The sample was divided by sports affiliation (Contact n = 115; Non-Contact n = 74) and concussion history (2 + Concussion n = 43; 0 Concussion n = 108). Comparative subgroups were statistically equivalent for age, education and estimated IQ (P > 0. 05), with the Contact sport groups having markedly higher incidences of concussion than controls (p < 0. 000). Measures included the ImPACT Verbal and Visual Memory, Visuomotor Speed and Reaction Time <b>Composites,</b> Digit <b>Symbol</b> Substitution and Digit Symbol Incidental Recall (immediate and delayed), the ImPACT Symptom Scale and a Post-concussion Symptom (PCS) questionnaire. Independent t-tests on cognitive measures at pre-and post-season revealed a predominant trend of Contact and 2 + Concussion groups performing worse, although only ImPACT Reaction Time at pre-season reached significance (p = 0. 014). PCS comparisons revealed an overwhelming tendency of enhanced symptoms for Contact and 2 + Concussion groups with total scores being significantly different in most instances at pre-and post-season. Fatigue and aggression were the symptoms most pervasively high for the Contact and 2 + Concussion groups. Dependent t-test analyses at pre- versus post-season, revealed significant practice effects for the Contact group, not in evidence for controls on ImPACT Visual Motor Speed and Digit Symbol Incidental Recall-Delayed.

40|$|Before the {{appearance}} of writing in Mesoamerica, symbols with a religious significance had appeared. These symbols were of course devised by the Olmecs {{and they seem to}} have been used to symbolize the attributes and functions of the gods {{and at the same time}} as a means of distinguishing between the gods. In Mayan culture also, a number of important signs which were included among the hieroglyphs often appear independently, attached to images of gods and to religious vestments and ceremonial objects. In these cases, it can be considered that they were performing some specific symbolic function, having been removed from the context of the calendar or inscriptions. These iconographic features surely follow the traditions of the Olmec styles and can be inferred to have been a intermediate culture; in particular, they were inherited by the Mayans through the Izapa style. The themes or subjects of the symbols are tropical animals and birds, such as jaguars, snakes, crocodiles, owls, etc.; plants, such as corn; natural forces and phenomena, such as rain, water, fire, wind, thunder, storms; celestial bodies, such as the sun, the moon, Venus, etc.. Intellectual associations or mythological themes linking the concept "precious" to rain and water and jade, etc. are also expressed through these symbols. The basic composition principles of the symbols had already been regulated in the Olmec time. A realistic image was first dissolved into its component elements, and each element was then abstracted and transformed into a cipher-type geometric pattern. Next, the different, <b>composite</b> <b>symbols</b> would be newly created by making various combinations of the cipher-like elements. Olmec symbols include the U-shape, the X-shape (the St. Andrew's cross or crossed bands), V-shape, Y-shape, stepped motifs, crosses, petal shapes, quincunx, rhomboids, circlets or circles and dots, spirals, etc [...] These symbols are attached to colossal heads, stone monu-ments, stela, altars, rock carvings, reliefs, masks, Celts, figurines, ceramic wares, etc.. In the Izapa style, the number of symbols is limited compared to the Olmec style, but the symbols are more developed and formal in design and more decorative. As for the symbols inherited from the Olmecs, the U-shape and the X-shape are most common, and in the Izapa style these symbols are attached to compound creatures which combine the characteristics of felines and reptiles. Olrriec symbols were also incorporated in the Zapotecan style and are to be found in tumuli murals, in stelae, and in effigy urns of humans; animals, birds, etc. In the Izapa and Zapotecan age, there were plentiful contacts with the Teotihuacan culture in the Valley of Mexico, and this led to appearance of various new, kinds of symbols. Ultimately; these symbols were all absorbed by the Maya hieroglyphs, resulting in the creation of the only high-level glyph system in Mesoamerica. The date, month, time, and numbers were all considered sacred by the Mayans and each was linked with specific gods. In the case of the Mayans, most of the symbols created by the Olmecs were adopted as symbols to express calendar dates and each month. For exa-mple, the U-shape was used for the moon or as the symbol of the M god, the X-shape was the sign of the Uo month or was used in connection with the Dragon god (bird-serpent god) and the moan bird. The cross was called the Kan cross and was incorporated into the hieroglyph for Pop, the first month of the year and was related to the Jaguar god. The T-shape was used as the glyph for the IK day and was the symbol of the long-tipped god or the B god. Besides these, the petal sign was used as the Kin sign and was ahe symbol of the Suri god; circles and circlets were the signs of the water day Muluc; the rhomboid was the symbol of Lamat day. and was related to Venus. The various abstract signs described above were devised by the Olmecs, but iconographically speaking; we do not yet have an adequate understanding of the actual shape of the original images. This paper analyses the main symbols, such as the U-shape, the X-shape, the cross; the quincunx etc., indicates their original shapes, then offers a hypothesis concerning the process by which they were transformed; into abstract symbols...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBecause of {{the limited}} {{availability}} of the spectrum allocated for navigation systems, the numerous navigation signals broadcast by Modernized GPS and Galileo system {{will have to be}} combined and employ bandwidth-efficient modulations. Indeed, the GPS modernization scheme entails the addition of the new military signal (M-code) to the established C/A and P(Y) codes at the same carrier frequency. One of the most important questions is how to combine this new signal with the legacy ones at the payload level, while maintaining good performance at reception. This problem also exists for Galileo since: - in the L 1 band, the Open Service (OS) signal (two channels) and the Public Regulated Service (PRS) signal must be transmitted on the same carrier. - in the E 6 band, the Commercial Service (CS) signal must be transmitted with the PRS signal. The Interplex modulation, a particular phase-shiftedkeyed/ phase modulation (PSK/PM), was chosen to transmit all these signals because it is a constant-envelope modulation, thereby allowing the use of saturated power amplifiers with limited signal distortion ([STF, 2002; Rajan and Irvine, 2005]). The main objective {{of this paper is to}} study the Interplex modulation, as it is used for the GPS and Galileo signals. In a first part we will present the Interplex modulation, its general formulation and its application for the multiplexing of three signals. Then, we will be interested in the application of this modulation to the GPS L 1 signals and the Galileo L 1 signals. We will give the general expression of the GPS L 1 Interplex signal and show the modification which must be made on the general expression of the Interplex modulation to apply it to the case of the combination of the C/A and P(Y) codes with the new M-code. With regards to the Galileo signals we will study two different cases. In the first case we will consider that the OS signal is a classical BOC(1, 1).

40|$|International audienceRecently the GPSIIR-M and the {{experimental}} Galileo satellites (GIOVE-A) were launched making {{the first step}} in the orbit-validation of the GPS modernization system and of the Galileo system. The new signals generated by the GPSIIR-M satellite and the Galileo system require modulations which are more complex than the QPSK modulation used in the current GPS system. These new modulations could be a source of distortions for the received signal and require analyses and optimisation. Indeed, in the Galileo system, the Alternate Binary Offset Carrier modulation (ALTBOC) is an innovative modulation proposed for the transmission of the E 5 band signal and the <b>Composite</b> Binary Coded <b>Symbol</b> (CBCS) is an innovative signal proposed to optimize the L 1 Open service (OS) signal. All the Galileo signals have a constant envelope modulation, thereby allowing the use of saturated power amplifiers with limited signal distortion. However the signals have 8 phase 'scattered' plots in the modulation diagram and a deviation of the modulation plots, with respect to the nominal constellation, could reduce the performance of the tracking loops in the receiver. This deviation of modulation plots constellation could be induced by the Amplitude-Modulation to Phase- Modulation (AM/PM) distortions of the amplifier in the payload. But it could also be resulting from the phase noise created by the instabilities of the payload and receiver clocks. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the impact of the phase noise due to the SSPA (Solid State Power Amplifier) and to the payload and receiver clocks instabilities, on the receiver tracking performance. The case of the Galileo E 5 signal will be studied considering a classical payload scheme. The transmission scheme can be described as follows. In the payload unit, the signals are first digitally generated, then converted by a digital-to-analog device, up-converted, and then amplified by the SSPA before being transmitted in their respective frequency bands. In the receiver part, the signals are down-converted, then go through the analog-to-digital converter, and are finally tracked by the Phase Lock Loop and the Delay Lock Loop. The evaluation of the performance in reception is based on the phase error estimated in the Phase Lock Loop. In a first part the way the phase noise affects the signals through the payload assuming a typical performance of the on-board clock generation unit is studied. In this part the phase noise introduced by the SSPA is also investigated and compared to the phase noise introduced by the atomic clock instabilities. Then, the power spectral density of the phase noise due to the receiver clock and its effects on the received signal during the down-conversion and the analog-to-digital conversion are presented. The effect of the incoming signal phase noise on the phase estimation in the Phase Lock Loop is also studied. Finally, to conclude, the impact of the SSPA phase noise and payload/receiver clocks phase noise on the receiver performance are summarized...|$|R
30|$|The {{binary offset}} carrier (BOC) {{modulation}} represents a serious candidate for global navigation satellite system (GNSS), especially for future {{global positioning system}} (GPS). Proposed by [1], the BOC modulation has several advantages compared to the traditional binary phase shift keying (BPSK), such as good spectral efficiency, high accuracy, enhanced multipath (MP) resolution [2], and better anti-jamming performances [3]. Other forms of modulation derived from the BOC concept are also used for new GPS and Galileo systems, such as {{quaternary phase shift keying}} modulation in L 5 GPS signals [4], alternative BOC modulation in E 5 Galileo signals [4], multiplexed BOC (MBOC) modulation with composite BOC (CBOC) implementation for Galileo, and time-multiplexed BOC (TMBOC) implementation for future GPS L 1 C [5]. Although these modulations are an important innovation for GNSS systems, there are other modulations of great interest, such as binary coded symbol (BCS) modulation [6, 7], <b>composite</b> binary coded <b>symbols</b> (CBCS) modulation [7], quadrature multiplexed BOC modulation [8], minimum shift keying BOC modulation [9], multi-level subcarrier modulation specifically for three-level or tertiary offset carrier (TOC) subcarrier modulation and five-level signals or 8 -PSK subcarrier modulation [9, 10], and m-PSK BOC modulation [11]. The 8 -PSK signals achieve mostly better performances at lower bandwidth than comparable signal types. The effort to search for new signal waveforms (WFs) for navigation continues in order to propose a WF that has lower levels of interference with existing signals with an insurance of better performances in terms of MP mitigation and jamming reduction. In this paper, we propose efficient WFs for GNSS system which are labeled as sine-phased binary offset carrier with adjustable width (BOC-AW). These WFs are three-level (- 1, 0, 1) and based on the sine-phased BOC concept with adjustable pulse width within each subcarrier half cycle. A judicious choice of the pulse widths of the BOC-AW general mathematical model provides the general types of BOC and TOC WFs. The purpose of the proposed WFs is to eliminate components of the side lobes near the main lobe {{and at the same time}} increase the other side lobes of higher frequencies (far away from the main lobe) in order to get better performance in terms of MP and interference mitigation. Indeed, the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the proposed BOC-AW(p,q,α(M)) modulation presents a sharper main peak due to the larger number of transitions of the signal in the chip interval, which obviously corresponds to a greater slope of the discrimination function, allowing a reduction of MP effect. Also, BOC-AW modulations show better performances than BOC(p,p) and BOC(p, 1) modulations for p >[*]>[*] 1 with regard to the receiving band. Moreover, both latter modulations have inconveniences. In fact, BOC(p,q) WFs (q >[*]>[*] 1) need the use of several generator polynomials in contrast to the case where q[*]=[*] 1, which uses only two generator polynomials. Also, it has been found that the tracking loop design for BOC(p, 1) with p >[*]>[*] 1 may be more problematic than for BOC(1, 1), especially with the conventional delay locked loop (DLL) algorithm with a narrow correlator. In effect, the BOC(p, 1) ACFs with p >[*]>[*] 1, in contrast to that of BOC(1, 1) modulation, produce several side peaks which complicate the DLL locking operation. The proposed WFs present also a better spectral separation and MP mitigation. Furthermore, they have better resistance against noise and jammer, and they can be used in conjunction with other MP mitigation techniques [12 – 15] for performance improvement.|$|R
