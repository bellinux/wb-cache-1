40|$|International audienceIn this paper, we derive a cost-minimizing {{approach}} for {{governments in the}} eurozone that have to define their debt structure in terms of <b>currency</b> <b>of</b> <b>issuance</b> and maturity. We introduce and characterize the concept of weighted coalitional αα-equilibrium to assure stability of two tiers of the eurozone, the stronger (White) countries and the weaker (Yolk) countries. The equilibrium presents both the Pareto optimality {{of the countries in}} each tier and the stability against any deviation of each subcoalition. In a practical way, it would require either strong political integration within each tier or considerable market pressure...|$|E

5000|$|Burnet's {{tenure as}} New Jersey {{governor}} {{was marked by}} disputes over the <b>issuance</b> <b>of</b> bills of credit and the granting of a permanent salary. Bills of credit, {{in addition to providing}} funding for the province's expenses, also circulated as local <b>currency.</b> <b>Issuance</b> <b>of</b> large quantities of such bills had an inflationary tendency to devalue them relative to the pound sterling. Burnet was under instructions to disallow their issuance except under certain conditions. [...] When the provincial assembly in 1721 approved a bill that called for the <b>issuance</b> <b>of</b> £40,000 in bills secured by property mortgages Burnet dissolved the assembly. However, he approved similar legislation in 1723 in exchange for the legislature's approval of a five-year salary plan. [...] When the assembly began appropriating funds from the bills in unapproved ways a few years later, Burnet was again convinced to sign in exchange for a grant of £500 for [...] "incidental expenses". [...] This method by which the assembly essentially bribed the governor for his agreement in violation of instructions became somewhat normal practice in New Jersey with later governors.|$|R

40|$|Modern {{currency}} {{boards are}} not necessarily precluded from financing government spending and may feature only partial foreign reserve backing. The potential dangers are highlighted by the Cook Islands case, where accelerating rates <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> <b>issuance,</b> com-bined with rising government budget deficits, led to a crisis of confi-dence in 1994. It {{is unlikely that the}} seigniorage gained from the short-lived currency board experiment outweighed the costs associ-ated with the swings in policy. In the end, delayed fiscal retrench-ment was accompanied by an abrupt contraction in the money supply as the local currency was withdrawn in 1995 and full dollar-ization re-established. A country that is willing to give up an independent monetary pol-icy always has the option of simply adopting an established foreign currency (such as the U. S. dollar) as the local circulating medium and “dollarizing ” the economy. This practice ordinarily offers no scope for government revenue from money creation, however, leav-ing all such “seigniorage ” revenue to accrue abroad.

40|$|Using count-data techniques, {{this article}} studies the {{determinants}} <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> {{choice in the}} <b>issuance</b> <b>of</b> foreign-currency-denominated bonds. In particular, we investigate whether bond issuers choose their issuance currency in order to exploit the borrowing-cost savings associated with deviations from uncovered and covered interest parity. Our findings show that the choice <b>of</b> <b>issuance</b> <b>currency</b> is sensitive to deviations from uncovered interest parity but insensitive, in general, to deviations from covered interest parity. Furthermore, the influence of deviations from uncovered interest parity is stronger for financial issuers than for nonfinancial issuers. In {{as much as the}} <b>issuance</b> <b>of</b> foreign-currency-denominated bonds affects the relative international standing <b>of</b> world <b>currencies,</b> one implication <b>of</b> these findings is that monetary policy, through its influence on nominal interest rates, has a greater impact on the internationalization <b>of</b> <b>currencies</b> than has been previously accounted for. ...|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the Civil War, the U.S. {{operated}} on a gold standard in practice. Bank notes were legal tender issued by state banks {{which could be}} exchanged for an amount of gold at any bank. Both gold and bank notes circulated as mediums of exchange. On February 25, 1862, the U.S. passed the First Legal Tender Act to help finance the Civil War. The act changed the economy to a fiduciary standard based on a fiat currency called United States Notes, or more popularly called greenbacks. Unlike bank notes, greenbacks were not backed by any sort of metallic standard and acted almost like a [...] "loan without interest". Greenbacks were issued as an immediate, short-term relief for the country's growing demand for <b>currency.</b> The <b>issuance</b> <b>of</b> greenbacks and the sale of government bonds to finance the war were led by the Secretary of the Treasury at the time, Salmon P. Chase. Until 1879, gold, bank notes, and greenbacks were used as mediums of exchange and had free floating exchange rates.|$|R

40|$|The Basel Committee for Banking Supervision {{designed}} {{a system of}} risk weights (the so called standardised approach) to measure the riskiness of banksÂ’ loan portfolios. Its ability to adequately reflect risk is empirically investigated in this paper, through {{an analysis of the}} economic capital allocations implied in corporate bond spreads. This is based on a unique dataset <b>of</b> <b>issuance</b> spreads, ratings and other relevant bond variables (such as maturity, face value, time <b>of</b> <b>issuance</b> and <b>currency</b> <b>of</b> denomination) including 7, 232 eurobonds issued mostly by Canadian, European, Japanese and U. S. companies during 1991 - 2003. Three main results emerge. First, the spread/rating relationship is strongly significant with spreads increasing when ratings worsen. Second, the estimated spreads per rating class indicate that the risk/rating relationship might be steeper than the one approved by the Basel Committee. Finally the difference between the spread/rating relation of banks and non-financial firms appears quite blurred and statistically questionable. Following this empirical evidence, we underline some adjustments in the standardised approach risk-weights that might be considered for the future versions of the Basel Accord. eurobonds, credit ratings, spreads, capital regulation, banks. ...|$|R

5000|$|Bryan {{quickly became}} {{prominent}} in Lincoln {{as a lawyer}} and a public speaker, becoming known as the [...] "Boy Orator of the Platte". In 1890, he agreed to run for Congress against William J. Connell, a Republican, who had won the local congressional seat in 1888. At that time, Nebraska was suffering hard times as many farmers had difficulties making ends meet due to low grain prices, and many Americans were discontented with the existing two major political parties. As a result, disillusioned farmers and others formed a new far-left party, which {{came to be known}} as the Populist Party. The Populists proposed both greater government control over the economy (with some calling for government ownership of railroads) and giving the people power over government through the secret ballot, direct election of United States Senators (who were, until 1913, elected by state legislatures), and replacement of the Electoral College with direct election of the president and vice president by popular vote. Party members in many states, including Nebraska, demanded inflation <b>of</b> the <b>currency</b> through <b>issuance</b> <b>of</b> paper or silver currency, allowing easier repayment of debt. After a candidate backed by the nascent Populists withdrew, Bryan defeated Connell for the seat by 6,700 votes (nearly doubling Connell's 1888 margin), receiving support from the Populists and Prohibitionists.|$|R
