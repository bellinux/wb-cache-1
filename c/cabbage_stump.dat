60|$|It was {{the signal}} for their onset. Nash pinioned his arms behind while Boland seized a long <b>cabbage</b> <b>stump</b> which {{was lying in}} the gutter. Struggling and kicking under the cuts of the cane and the blows of the knotty stump Stephen was borne back against a barbed wire fence.|$|E
60|$|They {{turned off}} the main road, past a black patch of common-garden, where sooty <b>cabbage</b> <b>stumps</b> stood shameless. No one thought to be ashamed. No one was ashamed of it all.|$|R
60|$|River's Cottage {{was not a}} prepossessing abode. It was a new building, of light-coloured bricks, with a door in {{the middle}} and one window on each side. Over the door was a stone tablet, bearing the name,--River's Cottage. There was a little garden between the road and the house, across which there was a {{straight}} path to the door. In front of one window was a small shrub, generally called a puzzle-monkey, and {{in front of the other}} was a variegated laurel. There were two small morsels of green turf, and a distant view round the corner of the house of a row of <b>cabbage</b> <b>stumps.</b> If Trevelyan were living there, he had certainly come down in the world since the days in which he had occupied the house in Curzon Street. The two ladies got out of the cab, and slowly walked across the little garden. Mrs. Trevelyan was dressed in black, and she wore a thick veil. She had altogether been unable to make up her mind as to what should be her conduct to her husband should she see him. That must be governed by circumstances as they might occur. Her visit was made not to him, but to her boy.|$|R
6000|$|Raggett Street, {{you must}} understand, was a {{thoroughfare}} over which some one had distributed {{large quantities of}} <b>cabbage</b> <b>stumps</b> and leaves. It opened out of {{the upper end of}} Farringdon Street, and 192A was a shop with the plate-glass front coloured chocolate, on which several of the same bills I had read upon the hoardings had been stuck. The floor was covered by street mud that had been brought in on dirty boots, and three energetic young men of the hooligan type, in neck-wraps and caps, were packing wooden cases with papered-up bottles, amidst much straw and confusion. The counter was littered with these same swathed bottles, of a pattern then novel but now amazingly familiar in the world, the blue paper with the coruscating figure of a genially nude giant, and the printed directions of how under practically all circumstances to take Tono-Bungay. Beyond the counter on one side opened a staircase down which I seem to remember a girl descending with a further consignment of bottles, {{and the rest of the}} background was a high partition, also chocolate, with [...] "Temporary Laboratory" [...] inscribed upon it in white letters, and over a door that pierced it, [...] "Office." [...] Here I rapped, inaudible amid much hammering, and then entered unanswered to find my uncle, dressed as I have described, one hand gripping a sheath of letters, and the other scratching his head as he dictated to one of three toiling typewriter girls. Behind him was a further partition and a door inscribed [...] "ABSOLUTELY PRIVATE--NO ADMISSION," [...] thereon. This partition was of wood painted the universal chocolate, up to about eight feet from the ground, and then of glass. Through the glass I saw dimly a crowded suggestion of crucibles and glass retorts, and--by Jove!--yes!--the dear old Wimblehurst air-pump still! It gave me quite a little thrill--that air-pump! And beside it was the electrical machine--but something--some serious trouble--had happened to that. All these were evidently placed on a shelf just at the level to show.|$|R
