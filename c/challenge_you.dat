500|$|The Albums 2000–2010 {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} most reviewers. A writer from The Sun awarded the box set a perfect five star rating, stating [...] "Whether you like hot-pant Kylie, indie Kylie, girl-next-door Kylie or dark Kylie, there's something for every Kylie fan {{in this special}} box-set. Made up of five albums and celebrating ten years of tunes, we <b>challenge</b> <b>you</b> {{to get them out}} of your head." [...] Scott Harrah from Stagezine awarded the album four-and-a-half stars out of five, but did not review the box set; instead, he reviewed each album individually because [...] "all [...] are so different in both sound and concept."

Despite being critical towards the lack of inclusion of her 1994–1998 Deconstruction work, and the inclusion of her albums, X, and Aphrodite, he concluded [...] "Kylie has yet to make that one essential album, and the going-through-the-motions nature of her later releases suggests her time may have passed, but this box set still contains plenty of moments to justify her position as one of the all-time premier pop princesses." ...|$|E
