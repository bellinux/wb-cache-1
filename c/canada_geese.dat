5|$|Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River {{attract a}} wide variety of waterfowl. Lake Phelps is just one of several large, shallow {{freshwater}} lakes on the Pamlico-Albemarle Peninsula. These lakes are all winter grounds for ducks, geese and swans. The waterfowl at Lake Phelps use the area primarily for roosting purpose before flying off to nearby feeding sites. Tundra swans and <b>Canada</b> <b>geese</b> feed in nearby farm fields and the ducks feed in the wetlands. The waterfowl usually arrive in the area in October and overwinter until February or March. Commonly seen waterfowl are <b>Canada</b> <b>geese,</b> tundra swans, mallards, American black ducks and northern pintail.|$|E
5|$|Bald eagles, ospreys, kingfishers, brook trout, and {{freshwater}} molluscs {{have all}} been observed on the tributaries Hammersley Fork and Trout Run. Bald eagles, ospreys, <b>Canada</b> <b>geese,</b> herons, and mallard ducks have visited Kettle Creek Lake. Various birds of prey have also temporarily visited the watershed. Ring-necked pheasants and ruffed grouse live in the watershed.|$|E

5|$|A {{grove of}} {{enormous}} incense cedars exists near Diamond Lake, {{and there is}} a forest of ponderosa pine at the nearby Emile Big Tree Trail. The Umpqua National Forest features swordferns and Douglas firs. Rocky Mountain elks, pronghorns, and mule deer, bobcats, black bears, and mountain lions live in the Fremont–Winema National Forest. The forest's rivers support populations of trout, and the lakes contain fish such as the largemouth bass. The forest is inhabited by avian species such as mallards, American bald eagles, <b>Canada</b> <b>geese,</b> and whistling swans. Peregrine falcons and Warner suckers also infrequently enter its boundaries.|$|E
5|$|Native trumpeter (Cygnus buccinator) and tundra swans (Cygnus columbianus) and {{non-native}} mute swans (Cygnus olor) may all {{be found}} on the lake in winter. Tundra swans are absent in summer as they migrate to the arctic and subarctic to nest, however, the non-native, Eurasian mute swans compete for habitat with the non-migrating trumpeter swan population and is an impediment to restoration of the native trumpeters around the Great Lakes. Additional native birds hosted by the lake include cardinals, blue jays, finches, orioles, woodpeckers, teal, mallards, resident and migratory <b>Canada</b> <b>geese,</b> and an occasional bald eagle.|$|E

5|$|Fishing {{and hunting}} are popular outdoor {{activities}} in South Dakota. Fishing contributes over $224million to South Dakota's economy, and hunting contributes over $303million. In 2007, over 275,000 hunting licences and 175,000 fishing licences {{were sold in}} the state; around half of the hunting licences and over two-thirds of the fishing licences were purchased by South Dakotans. Popular species of game include pheasants, white-tailed deer, mule deer, and turkeys, as well as waterfowl such as <b>Canada</b> <b>geese,</b> snow geese, and mallards. Targets of anglers include walleye in the eastern glacial lakes and Missouri River reservoirs, Chinook salmon in Lake Oahe, and trout in the Black Hills.|$|E
5|$|South Dakota's varied {{geography}} is inhabited by {{many species of}} birds. The state bird, the ring-necked pheasant, has adapted particularly well to the area after being introduced from China, and growing populations of bald eagles are spread throughout the state, especially near the Missouri River. The wild turkey is another large bird found {{in many areas of}} the state. The numerous lakes and wetlands of eastern South Dakota support migratory populations of <b>Canada</b> <b>geese,</b> snow geese, mallards, pelicans, and wood ducks. The prairie serves as home to songbirds such as meadowlarks (both the eastern and western varieties), goldfinches, and bluebirds, and the open landscape of the plains also suits many carnivorous birds, such as hawks, falcons, and owls.|$|E
50|$|<b>Canada</b> <b>Goose</b> {{began to}} expand internationally, and in 2010, it opened {{an office in}} Stockholm, Sweden, for its European operations.

5|$|Behind fish, {{the next}} most {{significant}} prey base for bald eagles are other waterbirds. The contribution of such birds to the eagle's diet is variable, depending on the quantity and availability of fish near the water's surface. Waterbirds can seasonally comprise from 7% to 80% of the prey selection for eagles in certain localities. Exceptionally, in the Greater Yellowstone area, birds were eaten as regularly as fish year-around, with both prey groups comprising 43% of the studied dietary intake. Preferred avian prey includes grebes, alcids, ducks, gulls, coots, herons, egrets, and geese. Bird species most preferred as prey by eagles tend to be medium-sized, such as western grebes (Aechmophorus occidentalis), mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and American coots (Fulica americana) as such prey is relatively easy for the much larger eagles to catch and fly with. American herring gull (Larus smithsonianus) are the favored avian prey species for eagles living around Lake Superior. Larger waterbirds are occasionally prey as well, with wintering emperor geese (Chen canagica) and snow geese (C. caerulescens), which gather in large groups, sometimes becoming regular prey. Other large waterbirds hunted at least occasionally by bald eagles have included common loons (Gavis immer), great black-backed gulls (Larus marinus), sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis), great blue herons (Ardea herodias), <b>Canada</b> <b>geese</b> (Branta canadensis), brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis), and fledging American white pelicans (P. erythrorhynchos). Colony nesting seabirds, such as alcids, storm petrels, cormorants, northern gannets (Morus bassanus), terns and gulls, may be especially vulnerable to predation. Due to easy accessibility and lack of formidable nest defense by such species, bald eagles are capable of preying on such seabirds at all ages, from eggs to mature adults, and can effectively cull large portions of a colony.|$|E
25|$|The refuge {{provides}} {{refuge for}} migrating waterfowl {{for up to}} 2,500 ducks and 4,500 <b>Canada</b> <b>geese.</b> Other migrating birds include <b>Canada</b> <b>geese,</b> wood ducks, mallards, blue-winged teal, and hooded mergansers. Some less numerous migrants are pintail, green-winged teal, American wigeon, scaup, bufflehead, golden-eye, ring-necked ducks, and black ducks.|$|E
25|$|Most bird strikes involve large {{birds with}} big populations, {{particularly}} geese and gulls in the United States. In {{parts of the}} US, <b>Canada</b> <b>geese</b> and migratory snow geese populations have risen significantly while feral <b>Canada</b> <b>geese</b> and greylag geese have increased in parts of Europe, increasing the risk of these large birds to aircraft. In {{other parts of the}} world, large birds of prey such as Gyps vultures and Milvus kites are often involved. In the US, reported strikes are mainly from waterfowl (30%), gulls (22%), raptors (20%), and pigeons and doves (7%). The Smithsonian Institution's Feather Identification Laboratory has identified turkey vultures as the most damaging birds, followed by <b>Canada</b> <b>geese</b> and white pelicans, all of which are very large birds. In terms of frequency, the laboratory most commonly finds mourning doves and horned larks involved in the strike.|$|E

40|$|Paper to the Hill and High Country Seminar, Lincoln College, 5 - 6 July 1989. The game of <b>Canada</b> <b>goose</b> {{management}} {{is a complex}} issue, on one side, the hunters; on the other, the farmers. Government takes the field as referee.
