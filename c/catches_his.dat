5|$|At Trotwood, {{he was a}} {{teammate}} of Shaw and Brandon Moore who would later join him at Michigan. As a junior in 2006, he posted 48 receptions for 851 yards, and as a senior, he totalled 868 on 52 <b>catches.</b> <b>His</b> four-year totals were 165 receptions for 2,637 yards and 28 touchdowns. As a senior, he was selected to the Division II first-team all-state squad, and named Ohio's offensive player of the year. He was also chosen {{to play in the}} Big 33 Football Classic, and ranked as the number 44, 89, and 104 wide receiver in the nation by Rivals.com, Scout.com, and ESPN, respectively. In that same year, Trotwood won their first playoff game since 1981, led by Roundtree's 13 receptions, 203 yards, and game-winning touchdown. Roundtree feels that his best game in high school was a 12-reception, 221-yard, 2-touchdown performance that helped his team overcome a 210 deficit.|$|E
5|$|McCarty {{was again}} {{used as a}} fullback and special teams player in 2015. After {{sustaining}} an unspecified injury in week 12, he missed several games and {{was placed on the}} six-game injured list. McCarty finished the season with only one carry and nine <b>catches,</b> <b>his</b> lowest total number of touches in any CFL season. With 12 starts, McCarty finished with one carry for 20 yards, nine receptions for 68 yards, as well as five special teams tackles and one kick return for 17 yards. McCarty played in the West Final and had one special teams tackle. He became a Grey Cup champion for the first time after rushing for three yards on a fake punt in the championship game versus the Redblacks.|$|E
25|$|An {{outstanding}} fieldsman in the slips or at short leg, Redpath took 83 Test <b>catches.</b> <b>His</b> bowling was undistinguished; he {{was once}} called for throwing against Glamorgan in 1964.|$|E
6000|$|He sits not a dozen yards away. If I {{glance over}} my {{shoulder}} I can see him. And if I <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> eye--and usually I <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> eye--it meets me with an expression---- ...|$|R

60|$|He {{seemed to}} be busy with the horses, and Berenger could not <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> eye.|$|R
25|$|He {{also scored}} 918 runs at 13.70, {{with a top}} score of 53 for Yorkshire against Surrey and, {{over the course of}} career, also took twenty <b>catches.</b> <b>His</b> other half centuries came against Lancashire and the “United South of England Eleven”.|$|E
25|$|He {{went on the}} 1928–29 tour to Australia, {{but only}} played in several state matches before making his debut for England in the 5th Test against South Africa at The Oval on 17 August 1929, making a duck and taking 2 <b>catches.</b> <b>His</b> cap number for England is 244.|$|E
25|$|Lowth was a {{left arm}} fast bowler, using a roundarm action, who was {{recorded}} in 8 matches designated first-class by CricketArchive. He totalled 101 runs with a highest score of 24 and held 3 <b>catches.</b> <b>His</b> bowling record was outstanding as he took 63 wickets in his eight games and twice achieved ten wickets in a match. Lowth played six times for Oxford University Cricket Club and also represented the Gentlemen twice in the Gentlemen v Players series.|$|E

25|$|When Rebus recovers the book, one {{entry in}} {{particular}} <b>catches</b> <b>his</b> interest. Five years ago, a mysterious fire burned Edinburgh's seedy Central Hotel down. Although all {{the staff and}} customers were accounted for, an unidentified {{body was found in}} the remains. The entry in the black book talks about a poker game that took place on the night the fire happened. However, it is written in cryptic shorthand, with obscure nicknames instead of the real names of the poker players.|$|E
25|$|With the {{reduction}} in the number of first-class matches to accommodate the increasing one-day programme, he never reached 1,000 runs in a season after 1971. 1972 was less successful for him with the bat. 21 matches brought him 682 runs at 27.28, and he failed to make a century. Also his bowling was ineffective. He took only 16 wickets at 51.81. However, he did hold 30 <b>catches.</b> <b>His</b> bowling figures were worse in one-day matches as well: 18 wickets in 20 matches at 31.05, conceding 4.09 runs per over.|$|E
25|$|He {{then takes}} {{his case to}} Jupiter, who gives his consent in return for Cupid's future help {{whenever}} a choice maiden <b>catches</b> <b>his</b> eye. Jupiter has Mercury convene an assembly of the gods in the theater of heaven, where he makes a public statement of approval, warns Venus to back off, and gives Psyche ambrosia, the drink of immortality, so the couple can be united in marriage as equals. Their union, he says, will redeem Cupid from his history of provoking adultery and sordid liaisons. Jupiter's word is solemnized with a wedding banquet.|$|E

25|$|For the 1897 season, Bardswell {{was elected}} as {{captain of the}} Oxford University team. In {{the early part of}} the year, however, though notionally at Oxford, he took part in a three-month tour of the West Indies, again under the {{captaincy}} of Lord Hawke. He played in six first-class matches on the tour and scored well, taking in addition 18 <b>catches.</b> <b>His</b> captaincy at Oxford was not successful: the team was notably weaker than in his previous years and the University match was won decisively by Cambridge, though Bardswell top-scored in both Oxford innings.|$|E
25|$|Born August 26, 1990 {{and named}} after his hated father {{who left the}} family, Tory is an asocial self-proclaimed genius with a {{photographic}} memory, adept at playing arcade games. So unchallenged by academics that he resorts to other means of exhausting his energy, he is overly obsessive when something or someone <b>catches</b> <b>his</b> interest, and keeps tabs on every event he deems significant in his life, recording the exact time (down to the minute or second) and place in which they occur. When Colin moves into the apartment across the street, he instantly becomes hooked on tracking his every move. He chases after Colin, blinding himself {{with the prospect of}} uncovering his secrets; he is unwilling to admit to himself the circumstances surrounding his feelings towards the other boy.|$|E
25|$|He {{could also}} alter his {{personal}} mono-directional gravity field beneath himself {{to make himself}} virtually immovable {{as long as he}} was in contact with the ground, although an incredible force can uproot him, along with a chunk of whatever he is standing on. The only beings on record to have been able to move the Blob against his wishes are the Hulk, Juggernaut, and Strong Guy (powered-up near his limit by absorbing kinetic energy), although Colossus has managed to lift Dukes by digging underground and raising the piece of earth Dukes stands on, stating this as an exception to his immovability. Magneto once was able to move the Blob by lifting the ground under the Blob's feet via metal pipes. Despite his appearance, the Blob's speed and agility are those of a fairly athletic male of normal stature, a fact which frequently <b>catches</b> <b>his</b> opponents by surprise.|$|E

25|$|Taylor's swansong was the 1998–99 Ashes {{series against}} England, {{which began with}} his 100th Test in the First Test in Brisbane. He scored 46 and a duck—his first in Australia—as England were saved when {{thunderstorms}} forced the abandonment of play on the final afternoon. Two half centuries {{in the next two}} Tests in Perth and Adelaide saw Australia win by seven wickets and 205 runs respectively, thereby retaining the series 2–0. After losing the Fourth Test by 12 runs after a dramatic final day collapse, Taylor headed to his home ground, the Sydney Cricket Ground, for what would be his final Test. Australia {{went on to win the}} Test by 98 runs and take the series 3–1. Taylor only scored two in both innings, but he broke Border's world record for the most Test <b>catches.</b> <b>His</b> catch in the first innings equalled Border's 156 and another in the second made him the sole owner of the record.|$|E
25|$|Lloyd had an {{extensive}} playing career, with 407 first-class matches and 288 one day games. He scored nearly 27,000 runs and took 276 wickets {{in his career}} for Lancashire and England, and took 423 <b>catches.</b> <b>His</b> batting average of 33.33 in all first-class cricket, and bowling average of 30.26, illustrate his capability as a successful all-rounder. He scored over 1,000 runs in a season on ten occasions, and scored hundreds in all three major domestic competitions. His total career spanned twenty years from 1965 to 1985, and he also played lower level cricket for Cumberland as well as league and club cricket in Accrington, for whom he continues to appear to this day along with his son. He scored the winning runs for Accrington in {{the final game of}} the 2009 season ensuring they won their seventh Lancashire League title. It was in the Lancashire League initially that Lloyd found enough success {{to attract the attention of}} the county selectors, playing 33 matches for Accrington between 28 July 1962 and his first-class debut.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{evening at}} home, while smoking cannabis, when Alice asks {{him if he}} had sex with the two girls, Bill reassures her that he had not. She inquires if he is jealous of men who are attracted to her. He thinks women are more faithful than men. She tells him of a recent fantasy she had about a naval officer they had met on vacation. Disturbed by Alice's revelation, Bill is called by the daughter of a patient who has just died. After visiting the home, he goes to a prostitute named Domino but Alice phones as Domino begins to kiss Bill. Meeting Nick at the jazz club Bill learns that Nick has an engagement where he must play piano blindfolded. Bill learns that to gain admittance, one needs a costume, a mask, and the password, which Nick had written down. Bill goes to a costume shop and offers the owner, Mr. Milich, a generous amount of money to rent a costume. In the shop, Milich <b>catches</b> <b>his</b> teenage daughter with two Japanese men and expresses outrage at their lack of a sense of decency.|$|E

25|$|Knott {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Surrey against New South Wales during the state's 1995 visit to England. Knott appeared in first-class cricket for Surrey from 1995 to 1998, making 12 appearances, {{the last of}} which came against Nottinghamshire in the 1998 County Championship. An able, if somewhat inconsistent batsman, Knott scored 273 runs {{at an average of}} 21.00, with a high score of 49*. Behind the stumps he took 12 catches and made 2 stumpings. It was for Surrey that he made his List A debut for in the 1997 Benson & Hedges Cup against British Universities. He played List A cricket for Surrey until 1998, making 10 appearances, the last of which came against Derbyshire in the 1998 AXA League. In those 10 matches, he scored a total of 142 runs at an average of 17.75, with a high score of 98. Behind the stumps he took 15 <b>catches.</b> <b>His</b> score of 98, which came against Gloucestershire in 1998, was to remain his highest List A score. During his time at Surrey, Knott largely stood in for Alec Stewart when he was unavailable due to England duties, {{toward the end of his}} time with the county, he was below Jonathan Batty in the selection pecking order. He was released by Surrey at the end of the 1998 season.|$|E
25|$|In June 1986 Mehmet and Ali start a cab {{firm called}} 'OzCabs' from a corner table in Ali's Café. Mehmet is married with three children, but monogamy is one {{sanctity}} of marriage {{that he is}} {{more than willing to}} overlook. Later that month punk Mary Smith (Linda Davidson) <b>catches</b> <b>his</b> eye, and so he bets his sceptical brother £10 that he can get Mary to have sex with him. Mary is well aware that Mehmet's intentions are dishonourable and initially refuses to have sex with him, but Mehmet persists and she finally relents and spends the night with him. A triumphant Mehmet then collects his winnings and gloats to his brother in the café. However, Mary overhears their entire conversation and she then sets about trying to get revenge on him by hoax calling his cab-firm and vandalising his car. Later in the year Mehmet acts as Pat Wicks's (Pam St. Clement) pimp, setting her up with clients on a regular basis and he even persuades Pat to convince Mary to go prostitute herself too. He also gets involved in Kathy Beale's (Gillian Taylforth) Knitting business, later conning her and disappearing with all her profits. After he gets into more trouble with his customers for overcharging on fares and then trying to seduce Hannah Carpenter (Sally Sagoe) — the wife of his employee — the residents of Albert Square decide to confront him. Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), Pete Beale (Peter Dean) and Tony Carpenter (Oscar James) find him and give him a severe beating which involves having his arms pinned behind his back whilst taking a number of blows to the stomach.|$|E
25|$|Waugh and Mark Taylor {{opened on}} debut against Tasmania at Hobart's TCA Ground. New South Wales were sent into bat and Waugh was {{dismissed}} for 13 and New South Wales fell to 3/60 {{in the first}} innings. He scored 28 in the second innings, but the drawn match was more notable for an incident on the third morning, when the new opening pair overslept on Taylor's 21st birthday. They were punished by coach Bob Simpson with fielding driils, forcing the pair to take hundreds of <b>catches.</b> <b>His</b> took his first catch, that of Roger Woolley on debut. Waugh fell on tough times, being dismissed for a duck and four by Test bowler Merv Hughes in the next match against Victoria and then 17 and a run out for another duck against the touring New Zealand. With a first-class average of 10.33, Waugh was dropped {{for the next five}} matches. However, for the final four matches of the season, Waugh was recalled to the team as a front-line fast bowler and middle order batsman. He took 4/130 in the first innings against Queensland in his first match in the role. They were his first-class wickets. His bowling was characterised by his liberal use of short-pitched bowling. In the next match against Tasmania, Waugh opened the bowling with Mike Whitney, due to injuries to other bowlers, taking 2/31 in the first innings. Waugh then took 3/49 in the final round robin match against Queensland, before the teams met again for the Sheffield Shielf final at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Whitney and Waugh were New South Wales' only pacemen, and Waugh bowled 27 overs to take 1/71. Batting at No. 7, Waugh was involved in a century stand with Greg Dyer to help avoid the follow on with 41. Waugh made only 24 in the second innings as the home team hung on for a draw to secure the Shield. Waugh had scored 167 runs at 15.18 and took 11 wickets at 32.00 for the season. He played in one limited-overs match, scoring 13 and taking 1/28 against Victoria.|$|E
