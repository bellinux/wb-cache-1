I attempt to overcome the difficulties associated with estimating this causal relationship by using fixed-effects models. Thus, I exploit the variation over time for each individual woman in order to estimate the interaction effect of <b>career</b> <b>and</b> private life on life satisfaction. The results suggest that only a small fraction of women achieve <b>career</b> <b>and</b> cohabitation or motherhood simultaneously. In addition, this proportion remains small across the younger birth cohorts of college-educated females.

Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative methodology using a sample of 25 executive women explores <b>career</b> advancement <b>and</b> career/family balance strategies within work and family contexts. Findings - Analysis produces multiple <b>career</b> advancement <b>and</b> career/family balance strategies, including professional support, personal support, value system, and life course strategies such as the "ordering" of <b>career</b> <b>and</b> family, negotiating spousal support, and whether to have children.
