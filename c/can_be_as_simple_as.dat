25|$|Pet clips <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> or <b>as</b> {{elaborate}} as owners wish. The hair {{under the}} tail {{should always be}} kept short to keep feces from matting in the dog's curls. Most owners also keep the feet and face clipped short to prevent dirt from matting between toes, tear stains on lighter-coated poodles and food from matting around the dog's muzzle. Beyond these sanitary requirements, desired clips depend on owners' preferences. Some owners maintain a longer clip in winter than summer.|$|R
25|$|Excavation {{processes}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> hauling {{the contaminated}} soil to a regulated landfill, {{but can also}} involve aerating the excavated material {{in the case of}} volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Recent advancements in bioaugmentation and biostimulation of the excavated material have also proven to be able to remediate semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) onsite. If the contamination affects a river or bay bottom, then dredging of bay mud or other silty clays containing contaminants (including sewage sludge with harmful microorganisms) may be conducted.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} form of degradation, however, is a {{decrease}} in polymer chain length. Mechanisms which break polymer chains are familiar to biologists because of their effect on DNA: ionizing radiation (most commonly ultraviolet light), free radicals, and oxidizers such as oxygen, ozone, and chlorine. Ozone cracking is a well-known problem affecting natural rubber for example. Plastic additives can slow these process very effectively, and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> a UV-absorbing pigment (e.g. titanium dioxide or carbon black). Plastic shopping bags often do not include these additives so that they break down more easily as ultrafine particles of litter.|$|E
25|$|Hardware {{interrupts}} are signalled to the CPU {{using three}} inputs that encode the highest pending interrupt priority. A separate Encoder is usually required to encode the interrupts, though for systems {{that do not}} require more than three hardware interrupts it is possible to connect the interrupt signals directly to the encoded inputs at the cost of additional software complexity. The interrupt controller <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> a 74LS148 priority encoder, or may be part of a VLSI peripheral chip such as the MC68901 Multi-Function Peripheral (used in the Atari ST range of computers and Sharp X68000), which also provided a UART, timer, and parallel I/O.|$|E

Adeso looks at the skills that are required in new local economies before designing the training programs to equip local people with these skills.

25|$|If a {{responder}} begins rendering aid, he {{must not}} leave the scene until {{it is necessary to}} call for needed medical assistance, a rescuer of equal or higher ability takes over, or continuing to give aid is unsafe. This <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> a lack of adequate protection against potential diseases, such as vinyl, latex, or nitrile gloves to protect against blood-borne pathogens. A responder is never legally compelled to take risks to aid another person. The responder is not legally liable for any harm to the person assisted, as long as the responder acted rationally, in good faith and in accordance with their level of training.|$|E
25|$|The {{deletion}} {{of parts}} on a vehicle {{is an easy}} way for designers and vehicle owners to reduce parasitic and frontal drag of the vehicle with little cost and effort. Deletion <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> removing an aftermarket part, or part that has been installed on the vehicle after production, or having to modify and remove an OEM part, meaning {{any part of the}} vehicle that was originally manufactured on the vehicle. Most production sports cars and high efficiency vehicles come standard with many of these deletions in order to be competitive in the automotive and race market, while others choose to keep these drag-increasing aspects of the vehicle for their visual aspects, or to fit the typical uses of their customer base.|$|E
25|$|In a Stirling engine, the {{regenerator}} is {{an internal}} heat exchanger and temporary heat store placed between the {{hot and cold}} spaces such that the working fluid passes through it first in one direction then the other, taking heat from the fluid in one direction, and returning it in the other. It <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> metal mesh or foam, and benefits from high surface area, high heat capacity, low conductivity and low flow friction. Its function is to retain within the system that heat {{that would otherwise be}} exchanged with the environment at temperatures intermediate to the maximum and minimum cycle temperatures, thus enabling the thermal efficiency of the cycle (though not of any practical engine) to approach the limiting Carnot efficiency.|$|E

25|$|Expressions {{of affection}} are {{displayed}} in the animal kingdom as well. Affectionate behaviors do not include penetration or genital rubbing, but are still seen as a manner of sexual behavior. An affectionate activity <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> licking. Male lions are known for head rubbing, bats engage in licking, and mountain sheep rub horns and faces with each other. Animals have also engaged in kissing, touching of noses, mouths and muzzles have been witnessed in African elephants, walruses, and mountain zebras. Primates also engage in kissing that is incredibly similar to human display of kissing. Chimpanzees have full mouth-to-mouth contact, and bonobos kiss with their mouth open and mutual tongue stimulation. There {{are a variety of}} acts to show affection such as African elephants intertwining their trunks, giraffes engaging in “necking”, and Hanuman langurs cuddling with each other in a front to back sitting position.|$|E
25|$|Surgery {{can be done}} in case a {{peripheral}} nerve has become cut or otherwise divided. This is called peripheral nerve reconstruction. The injured nerve is identified and exposed so that normal nerve tissue can be examined above and below the level of injury, usually with magnification, using either loupes or an operating microscope. If a large segment of nerve is harmed, as can happen in a crush or stretch injury, the nerve will need to be exposed over a larger area. Injured portions of the nerve are removed. The cut nerve endings are then carefully reapproximated using very small sutures. The nerve repair must be covered by healthy tissue, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> closing the skin or it can require moving skin or muscle to provide healthy padded coverage over the nerve. The type of anesthesia used depends on the complexity of the injury. A surgical tourniquet is almost always used.|$|E
25|$|The {{main reason}} for using {{mathematical}} models and diagrams in trade studies is to provide estimates of system effectiveness, performance or technical attributes, and cost from a set of known or estimable quantities. Typically, a collection of separate models is needed to provide all of these outcome variables. The heart of any mathematical model {{is a set of}} meaningful quantitative relationships among its inputs and outputs. These relationships <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> adding up constituent quantities to obtain a total, or as complex as a set of differential equations describing the trajectory of a spacecraft in a gravitational field. Ideally, the relationships express causality, not just correlation. Furthermore, key to successful systems engineering activities are also the methods with which these models are efficiently and effectively managed and used to simulate the systems. However, diverse domains often present recurring problems of modeling and simulation for systems engineering, and new advancements are aiming to crossfertilize methods among distinct scientific and engineering communities, under the title of 'Modeling & Simulation-based Systems Engineering'.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{important}} to note that Agents are able to describe themselves during the association (or [...] "discovery") stage. An Agent announces that it has a standard configuration, that is likely to be known by the Manager, or a non-standard configuration. In either case, the Manager may ask the Agent to describe all of its objects (and thus its capabilities) during a configuration process. Agents <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> or <b>as</b> complex as the application demands. In this way the Manager builds a map of all of the Agent's objects.
