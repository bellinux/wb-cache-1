In this case, we can pack each of A⃗ and B⃗ into a single ciphertext with our packing method (see the below diagram). In the application scenario of Section 1.1, {{we assume that the}} number m of <b>customer’s</b> <b>ID</b> is smaller than the lattice dimension n (see our previous work [22] for the case m>n), and two binary vectors A⃗ and B⃗ represent purchase history data of items X and Y, respectively (note that it is different from the representation of purchase history data in Figure 1).|$|R

40|$|Current {{approaches}} for sequential pattern mining usually {{assume that the}} mining is performed in a static sequence database. However, databases are not static due to update so that the discovered patterns might become invalid and new patterns could be created. In addition to higher complexity, the maintenance of sequential patterns is more challenging than that of association rules owing to sequence merging. Sequence merging, which is unique in sequence databases, requires the appended new sequences to be merged with the existing ones if their <b>customer</b> <b>ids</b> are the same. Re-mining of the whole database appears to be inevitable since the information collected in previous discovery will be corrupted by sequence merging. Instead of re-mining, the proposed IncSP algorithm solves the maintenance problem through effective implicit merging and efficient separate counting over appended sequences. Patterns found previously are incrementally updated rather than re-mined from scratch. Moreover, the technique of early candidate pruning further speeds up the discovery of new patterns. Empirical evaluation using comprehensive synthetic data shows that IncSP is fast and scalable...|$|R

50|$|SQLstream {{provides}} a relational stream processing platform called SQLstream Blaze for analyzing {{large volumes of}} service, sensor and machine and log file data in real-time. It performs real-time collection, aggregation, integration, enrichment and real-time analytics on the streaming data. Data streams are analyzed using the industry standard SQL language, using the ANSI standard, functionally rich SQL window function to analyze and aggregate real-time streaming data over fixed or sliding time windows, which can be further partitioned by user defined keys. Unlike a traditional RDBMS SQL query, which returns a result and exits, streaming SQL queries do not exit, generating results continuously as soon as new data become available. Patterns and exception events in data streams are detected, analyzed and reported 'on the fly' as the data arrive, that is, before the data are stored. Like a database or data warehouse, SQLstream allows you to create multiple views over the data so that different applications and users can each get their own customized view of the streaming data. The partitioning allows many different analytics to be incrementally computed using a single SQL statement or window., effectively processing potentially millions of streams with a single statement. For example, partitioning by a <b>customer</b> <b>id</b> would maintain a separate computation for each distinct customer. This is extremely concise, but also allows for efficient parallel execution. SQLstream Blaze also allows changes {{to be made to}} the queries and views without bringing down and recompiling existing applications. This is very important for many Internet of Things and other smart services that must operate 24x7 on a continuous real-time basis, where application changes must be made without needing to bringing down the service or rebuild the application. Part of SQLstream Blaze, StreamLab takes advantage of this capability in order to guide users who wish to explore data streams and understand their structure while the data are still flowing by generating new SQL queries on the fly based on user direction and analysis of data values driven by rules. In this way, it {{provides a}}n effective platform for performing real-time operational intelligence, which you can view as real-time business intelligence over streaming operational data. SQLstream utilizes dataflow technology to execute many queries over high-velocity high-volume Big Data with a massively parallel standards-compliant SQL engine where the queries are executed concurrently and incrementally. Unlike databases, SQL in SQLstream becomes a language for performing continuous parallel processing, in contrast to a language for data retrieval as commonly found in relational databases. SQLstream is able to execute its queries in an optimized C++ multi-threaded dataflow engine which operates lock-free. This enables people to create lock-free parallel processing applications easily, which otherwise require specialist skillets and are often difficult to get working and are often error prone.|$|E

40|$|As digital {{watermarking}} {{has become an}} accepted means for copyright protection {{in the domain of}} virtual goods, additional services based on the basic mechanisms of embedding and retrieving watermarks are introduced. Automatic searching for potentially marked content and subsequent downloading and trying to retrieve the watermarks is one prominent example. The advantage of an automated service in comparison to manual handling is commonly accepted. A content owner will provide a search service provider the name of the work he wants to be monitored in the Internet, and at a later time he will receive a list with search results and retrieved watermarks. But one important drawback is the challenging legal situation. At the end, such a system is a tool automatically downloading large amounts of potentially copyrighted material, {{at the same time in}} some Internet domains distributing such content. Only after downloading and analyzing the content the provider of such a system can be sure the content is the one he is searching for. Wrong file names, fakes and similar issues can lead to downloading content no search order was provided for. So a search service provider would always be the potential target of law suits from third party content owners. In this work we discuss the legal aspects of this problem with respect to the different parties involved in the process. And this only one example of legal challenges in {{digital watermarking}}. Others are privacy concerns when combining media files and customer data or the actual value of using <b>customer</b> <b>IDs</b> as evidence when finding marked copies in the Internet.
