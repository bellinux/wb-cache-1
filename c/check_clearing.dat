500|$|Substitute {{checks are}} {{recognized}} as legal checks {{as long as the}} instruments meet specific requirements. These requirements include the faithful reproduction of the paper check and warranty of the instrument by the [...] "reconverting bank"â€”the financial institution that created the substitute check or the first financial institution that transferred or presented it during the <b>check</b> <b>clearing</b> process. Substitute checks are also subject to the UCC, existing federal and state check laws, and regulations specific to consumer rights that affect the acceptance of these instruments. Although a substitute check is subject to the UCC and existing state and federal check laws, the Check21 Act takes precedence over these other laws and regulations for this instrument.|$|E
500|$|A {{substitute}} check (also {{called an}} Image Replacement Document or IRD) is a negotiable instrument {{used to represent}} the digital reproduction of an original paper check.

Instead of presenting the original paper checks, financial institutions and payment processing centers electronically transmit data from a substitute check by either the settlement process through the United States Federal Reserve System or by clearing the deposit based on a private agreement between member financial institutions of a clearinghouse that operates under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC).|$|E

40|$|Between the {{founding}} of the Federal Reserve System in 1913 and the depression of the 1930 s, three check-clearing systems operated in the United States. The Federal Reserve <b>cleared</b> <b>checks</b> for members of the system. <b>Clearing</b> houses <b>cleared</b> <b>checks</b> for members of their organizations. Correspondents <b>cleared</b> <b>checks</b> for all other institutions. The correspondent-clearing system was vulnerable to counter-party cascades, particularly because accounting conventions overstated reserves available to individual institutions and the system as a whole. In November 1930, a correspondent system {{in the center of the}} United States collapsed, causing the closure of more than one hundred institutions. Bank runs radiated from the locus of events, and additional correspondent networks succumbed to the situation. For the remainder of the contraction, banks that relied upon correspondents to <b>clear</b> <b>checks</b> failed at higher rates than other banks.

40|$|The recent {{experience}} of the credit crunch has {{cast doubt on the}} prudence of regulation of the mortgage market based upon the concepts of responsible lending and borrowing. Both the Turner Review and the Financial Services Authority's follow-up Mortgage Market Review identified irresponsible lending as one of the principle causes of the credit crunch. Yet easy access to mortgage finance has underpinned the growth of owner occupation and the promotion of low-cost home ownership. This paper examines recent regulatory initiatives to articulate responsible lending and borrowing in more concrete terms, which suggests a shift towards greater lender responsibility through affordability <b>checks,</b> <b>clearer</b> product explanation and the possibility of product regulation.
