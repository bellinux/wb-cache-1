5000|$|Grain Mass flow is most {{commonly}} measured using a load cell with an impact plate {{attached to the}} load cell located {{at the top of}} the <b>clean</b> <b>grain</b> <b>elevator.</b> As the <b>clean</b> <b>grain</b> <b>elevator</b> paddles rotate around the top of the <b>clean</b> <b>grain</b> <b>elevator,</b> the grain is expelled from the elevator by centrifugal force and makes contact with the impact plate attached to the load cell. [...] The force applied by the grain is converted to an electrical signal by the load cell that is used to estimate the mass flow of the grain. A calibration of the sensor to develop a relationship of the amplitude of the electrical signal to grain mass flow and is calibrated on a harvester specific basis with the grain mass reported on a wet basis. This technology was developed and first commercialized by Ag Leader Technology. [...] The <b>clean</b> <b>grain</b> <b>elevator</b> speed is also measured and used in the calibration from electrical signal to mass flow as the elevator has a direct impact on the amount of force applied to the impact plate and load cell. This is the most common method for measuring grain flow in harvesters today and exists in different variations.|$|E
5000|$|Several factors {{affect the}} {{accuracy}} of the calibration beyond the calibration itself. Build up of material on the impact plate can cause the load cell response to be dampened to impacting grain, reducing the load cell response. Wear on the impact plate can also cause reduction in accuracy of a calibration. [...] The chain tension of the <b>clean</b> <b>grain</b> <b>elevator</b> affects the velocity at which grain is expelled from the elevator which changes the force that is applied at the impact plate. Manufacturers often advise properly tensioning the <b>clean</b> <b>grain</b> <b>elevator</b> before calibrating the grain yield monitor. [...] Excessive wear of the <b>clean</b> <b>grain</b> <b>elevator</b> paddles over time will also affect the mass flow calibration. Some harvesters use a solid plastic paddle over a rubber paddle for better consistency over time as worn paddles change the grain trajectory as it leaves the elevator changing the location the grain contacts the impact plate.|$|E
5000|$|Grain {{moisture}} content at harvesting {{is an important}} piece of the yield monitoring process. It is used in many cases, dependent upon manufacturer, in the grain mass flow sensor calibration and provides producers with additional information about spatial variability within a field. Grain moisture is sensed by measuring the capacitance of the grain by passing a known grain volume between two electrically conductive plates. Typically this sensor is mounted on the <b>clean</b> <b>grain</b> <b>elevator</b> and a sample metered into the sensor {{and back into the}} <b>clean</b> <b>grain</b> <b>elevator</b> after it has been processed. [...] This sensor orientation allows for sampling grain moisture throughout a field during harvest operations.|$|E

40|$|A {{feasibility}} {{study was conducted}} to measure grain quality (moisture and protein content) with near-infrared reflection (NIR) technology on a conventional New Holland TX 64 combine harvester A Zeiss Corona NIR sensor was installed on a bypass unit of the <b>clean</b> <b>grain</b> <b>elevator,</b> and reference samples were taken {{at the end of the}} bubble-up auger which transports the grain from the <b>clean</b> <b>grain</b> <b>elevator</b> to the grain bin. Measured signals at the diode array of the spectrophotometer were highly variable in time, and an appropriate low-pass filter was designed to extract relevant spectra at a sampling rate of 1 Hz. In addition, an optimal time shift was calculated between the location of the NIR measurement and the reference sampling to guarantee an optimal synchronization between the measured spectra and reference values. Preprocessing, calibration, and validation were executed using the PLSplus/IQ module of the GRAMS/ 32 software package. The calibration models were developed using the PLS algorithm and validated through cross-validation. Cross-validation errors of 0. 57 % and 0. 31 % were achieved for the on-line protein and moisture content measurements, respectively. These accuracies are comparable with the prediction accuracy that was achieved on a similar but stationary, unit and prove the technical feasibility of estimating grain quality on-the-go with NIR technology. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The Yield Monitor Test Facilityâ€™s {{performance}} {{under static}} grain flow was very good. First, the grain metering system accurately meters grain at varying flow rates to the <b>clean</b> <b>grain</b> <b>elevator</b> over the prescribed time interval. Second, the weigh scale system {{appears to be}} very accurate in measuring the accumulated mass flow in the system. However, grain stream dynamics, tank vibration, and load cell sensitivity confounds attempts to measure instantaneous grain flow at low rates of 1 to 4 kg/s. Third, the commercially available yield monitor flow sensor demonstrated excellent accuracy across {{a wide range of}} static flow rates from 1. 3 to 21. 1 kg/s. Percent differences in accumulated mass flow for the yield monitor and the weigh scale were less than 1 % at calibration flow rates and approximately 3 % for extreme flow rates. Instantaneous mass flow rate variation was observed to be approximately 8 % at the mean calibration flow rate...|$|E

40|$|Crop {{yield data}} and maps from {{previous}} years are {{a primary source}} of information from which crop management recommendations and decisions are based upon. Yield data is {{a useful tool for}} making crop management decisions, but becomes irrelevant when it is not accurate or reliable. The objectives of this research were to benchmark commercial yield monitoring systems to better understand performance and to assess limitations of measurement methods from mechanical and environmental influences. Two commercial yield monitors that measured mass and volumetric flow for yield estimation were selected for benchmarking. Each system was calibrated using manufacturer procedures and evaluated in a yield monitor test stand compliant with standards. <b>Clean</b> <b>grain</b> <b>elevator</b> paddle type and machine orientation were selected as treatment factors to evaluate accumulated load accuracy at different grain flow rates. There {{was no significant difference in}} mean estimation error for different paddle types for the impact-based mass flow yield monitor. There were significant differences in mean estimation error for different paddle types for the volumetric flow yield monitor. This was attributed to presentation of grain to the sensor between flat and misshapen paddles. Rolled and pitched machine orientations were shown to have significant influence on estimation accuracy for the volumetric flow yield monitor. However, the volumetric flow system maintained lower variability across flow ranges than the impact-based mass flow yield monitor because of a fundamental measurement system that does not rely entirely upon calibration. A fundamental measurement system and known machine properties may be able to overcome the challenges of a harvesting environment. Maintenance of yield monitor accuracy with less calibration will contribute to increased uptime and better basis for crop management decisions...|$|E
40|$|Summary: The Yield Monitor Test Facility {{was used}} to {{evaluate}} the GreenStar Â® mass flow sensor in a 9600 <b>clean</b> <b>grain</b> <b>elevator</b> under dynamically varying inflow rates. It was found that the GreenStar Â® yield sensor accurately predicts (less than 4 % error) accumulated mass (under dynamically varying step and ramp flow rates) within normal operating conditions of 4. 2 to 16. 9 kg/s (10 to 40 bu/min), and does a reasonable job of predicting flow at upper limits of 20 kg/s. The yield sensor accurately followed X 578 variable step flow rates while operating under 20 kg/s, but exhibited significant errors for flows above 20 kg/s. This was probably {{due to the fact that}} the GreenStar Â® was calibrated at 12. 7 kg/s. The maximum error in accumulated mass for the variable step profile was less than 2 %, while the average instantaneous flow error during steady state grain metering was estimated at 4. 4 % with a 3. 4 % standard deviation. Time averaging adjacent readings reduced the error to 3. 2 %. It was found that transient flow had maximum accumulated flow errors of approximately 5 %, while oscillating flow had errors around 2. 5 %. This was due to the fact that the transient flow maintains flow at the extremity of the GreenStar Â® operation range (based on 12. 7 kg/s calibration) for longer periods. The results from these test indicated that the GreenStarÂ® mass flow sensor accurately predicted total accumulated mass flow across a broad range of dynamic inflow rates and demonstrated good instantaneous flow prediction. Additionally, two second time averaging of adjacent flo...|$|E
40|$|Yield {{maps for}} corn and {{soybeans}} were developed using data obtained from a simple yield monitor and by using the GPS system for site location. A yield monitor was installed in the exit portion of the <b>clean</b> <b>grain</b> <b>elevator</b> of a combine. The principle used for the yield monitor {{was a series of}} light emitters and receivers such that the greater the grain flow rate, the smaller the amount of light seen by the receivers. The flow rate and voltage changes from the monitor appeared to be linearly related in a laboratory study. The monitor, however, needed to be calibrated with the dynamics that occur under actual field conditions. A differential GPS system was used so that corrected location data were obtained in real time. The speed of the combine was obtained using the speed output device of the combine. The voltage from the yield monitor and the frequency transducer for speed were digitized using a Daytronic signal conditioner. A program was written for a laptop computer that queried the GPS receiver and the signal conditioning unit to obtain the data. The data were stored in a spreadsheet format with each row of data containing a reading for GPS time, latitude, longitude, GPS speed, combine speed, and yield monitor m V output. Calibration was accomplished by weighing the grain collected {{over a period of time}} to obtain a scale factor that converted the mV output of the yield monitor to a flow rate. Knowing combine speed and cutting width, instantaneous yield could be calculated. Trade names are used in this paper solely for the purpose of providing specific information.

40|$|The {{mapping of}} within-field crop yield {{variations}} offers {{a basis for}} the adjustment of input application rates to match yield potential. The aim of this project was to examine available yield mapping components and systems, and to assess the benefits that could accrue from yield mapping. The work also included site investigations of possible causes of yield reduction, and an evaluation of the potential increase in profitability from variable-rate N application. Yield mapping requires the continuous measurement of harvester position and grain yield. Accurate positioning was achieved with systems which received a remote correction signal via communications satellite. A grain flow meter in the <b>clean</b> <b>grain</b> <b>elevator</b> gave low errors in conditions where the deflector plate could be kept clean. The production of useful yield maps was sometimes limited by rainy weather leading to wet crops, lodging, and big variations in harvest conditions within the field. Difficulties are also presented by small, irregularly-shaped fields. The level of within-field variation in cereal yields (25 % of the field area at least 21 % below the mean) suggests that there is scope for identifying low-yielding areas and either taking corrective action or applying reduced inputs. An analysis of the results of N fertiliser trials suggests a potential gain from about Â£ 20 /ha in sugar beet to less than Â£ 10 /ha in spring barley if N application rate could be varied to apply the optimum amount to each area within a field. All the costs of application map development and variable-rate application would need to fall below these gains to justify the use of the technology. To allow further use to be made of yield maps, it is desirable that the factors responsible for yield reduction be identified, in particular those which recur each year. In the present study, soil chemical analysis and compaction affected yield in only a small proportion of cases. Differences between maps from successive years have been small. It is concluded that the immediate financial benefits from the use of this technology will be small. However, in a future where the recording, justification and minimisation of inputs such as pesticides and fertiliser will grow in significance, and where the cost of the equipment and software will continue to fall, yield mapping and variable-rate input application will find a useful role.
