50|$|Unlike other {{sorbic acid}} salts such as {{potassium}} sorbate (E202) and <b>calcium</b> <b>sorbate</b> (E203), {{the use of}} sodium sorbate as a food additive is not allowed in the EU due to potential genotoxic effects.|$|E
50|$|Sorbic {{acid and}} its salts, such as sodium sorbate, {{potassium}} sorbate, and <b>calcium</b> <b>sorbate,</b> are antimicrobial agents {{often used as}} preservatives in food and drinks to prevent the growth of mold, yeast, and fungi. In general the salts are preferred over the acid form {{because they are more}} soluble in water, but the active form is the acid. The optimal pH for the antimicrobial activity is below pH 6.5. Sorbates are generally used at concentrations of 0.025% to 0.10%. Adding sorbate salts to food will, however, raise the pH of the food slightly so the pH may need to be adjusted to assure safety. It is found in many other foods, such as cheeses and breads.|$|E
50|$|Processed {{sour cream}} can include {{any of the}} {{following}} additives and preservatives: grade A whey, modified food starch, sodium phosphate, sodium citrate, guar gum, carrageenan, <b>calcium</b> sulfate, potassium <b>sorbate,</b> and locust bean gum.|$|R
40|$|The shelf life, {{particularly}} the mould-free shelf life (MFSL) of bread, was evaluated either {{by adding a}} conventional chemical preservative or by spraying the surface of bread, in which a chemical preservative was added. As bread making is a complex process and bread is a multicomponent system, the investigation was based on statistical design experiments. Using first-order factorial designs, reliable models were constructed, revealing the effects of some common ingredients of bread (such as salt, sugar, glycerol, potassium <b>sorbate,</b> <b>calcium</b> propionate) and their interactions on the MFSL (optimisation parameter) with and without ethanol surface spraying. The effectiveness of preservation was ranked as potassium sorbate + ethanol > calcium propionate + ethanol > potassium <b>sorbate</b> > <b>calcium</b> propionate. Ethanol addition led to MFSL prolongation of 43. 5 % and 38. 5 % compared with MFSL of potassium <b>sorbate</b> and <b>calcium</b> propionate, respectively, when all the factors were fixed to their basic levels. © 2007 Institute of Food Science and Technology Trust Fund...|$|R
40|$|Several salt {{compounds}} {{were tested}} in vitro as inhibitors of Erwinia carotovora subsp. atroseptica (van Hall) Dye (Eca) and Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora (Jones) Bergey, Harrison, Breed, Hammer & Huntoon (Ecc), causal agents of bacterial soft rot of potato. All compounds were mixed with potato dextrose agar (PDA) to the concentrations 0. 002 M, 0. 02 M and 0. 2 M PDA amended with sodium metabisulfite, propyl-paraben, alum, potassium <b>sorbate,</b> <b>calcium</b> propionate and copper sulfate pentahydrate were completely inhibitory at the lowest concentration (0. 002 M). Studies examining the preventative and curative effects {{of the most effective}} compounds were conducted using Ecc (strain 71). As preventative disease control measures, tubers treated only with aluminum acetate, alum, calcium propionate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium hypochlorite or copper sulfate pentahydrate resulted in significantly (P < 0. 001) less soft rot than the untreated control. As curative disease control measures, tubers treated with only alum, aluminum acetate, sodium hypochlorite or copper sulfate pentahydrate, resulted in significantly (P < 0. 001) less soft rot than the untreated control. These compounds demonstrated a potential as replacements for commercially used pesticides as post-harvest disease control strategies. (C) 2006 Published by Elsevier B. V...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe adsorptive {{properties}} of synthetic calcium phosphates analogous to bone mineral were examined {{with respect to}} cisplatin and risedronate, two biological active drugs; the uptake and release experiments were carried out under various conditions {{in order to understand}} the basic mechanism of interaction. The effect of temperature and solution composition were highlighted and discussed. The adsorption results obtained for the therapeutic agents demonstrated that, depending on the conditions investigated (nature of the sorbent, concentration range, ionic composition, temperature...), the shape of the isotherms is of Freundlich or Langmuir type. The adsorption is described as an ion-exchange process in dilute solutions, while the interaction appears to be reactive for concentrated solutions (dissolution of mineral ions from the apatite substrate and formation of soluble calcium complex and/or precipitation of <b>calcium</b> salts involving <b>sorbate</b> molecules). The information gained on the surface reactivity of calcium phosphate were exploited to associate an antibiotic to calcium phosphate cements for drug delivery applications. The specimens were obtained by combination of calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate powders upon mixing with water. The physicochemical {{properties of}} the paste were altered by the drug loading method (in the liquid or solid phase). Thus, a dose-dependent effect was noticed for the paste setting time, hardening and the release process...|$|R
40|$|Growth of {{spoilage}} {{fungi in}} bread and other bakery products is currently controlled {{with the addition}} of weak acid preservatives. Consumers demand more natural products and thus {{there is a need to}} reduce the amount of chemical preservatives added to foods, or to identify alternative, more 'natural' antifungal compounds with strong biological activity. This thesis reports on several areas of research undertaken in the project: evaluation of sub-optimal concentrations of existing preservatives, under different environmental conditions, on growth and ochratoxin A (OT A) production by six bread spoilage moulds; efficacy of new/natural antifungal compounds for possible use in bread preservation; evaluation of the impact of preservation hurdles on ecophysiology of the spoilage fungi, including niche overlap; and mechanisms of action of preservatives on hydrolytic enzymes. It was found that the use of currently applied levels of the existing preservatives potassium <b>sorbate,</b> <b>calcium</b> propionate and sodium benzoate were effective, under low pH environments (pH 4. 5) at completely controlling growth of spoilage moulds (Aspergillus ochraceus, Eurotium repens, Cladosporium herbarum, Penicillium corylophilum and Penicillium verrucosum) on wheat flour-based substrates over a period of 30 days. At higher pH levels, the efficacy decreased being almost nil at pH 7. 5. The use of sub-optimal concentrations of weak acid preservatives led in most cases to reductions in lag times and/or stimulation of mould growth and ochratoxin A production by P. verrucosum strains.

40|$|An {{in vitro}} gas {{production}} technique {{was used to}} screen different organic acids (formic, propionic, lactic, citric, and fumaric acid), organic salts (<b>calcium</b> formate, potassium <b>sorbate,</b> and sodium benzoate), and inorganic phosphoric acid {{for their ability to}} modulate microbial fermentation in the digestive tract of piglets. For the incubation, 40 ml of culture medium (53 % buffer, 45 % frozen ileal digesta, and 2 % fresh faeces) was dispensed in vessels containing 5 ml of buffer, 0. 5 g of feed, and 20 ìl of liquid or 20 mg of solid acidifiers. Gas production was measured every 15 min during the 24 h incubation at 39 °C, and a Gompertz bacterial growth model was applied to the gas production data. Formic acid was the only acid that reduced the maximum rate of gas production (ìm) compared to that in the control treatment (P 0. 05). When investigating formic-acid-based mixtures that contained 15 % of potassium sorbate and/or sodium benzoate, the estimated parameters for the Gompertz growth model did not differ from those for treatments with plain formic acid (P > 0. 05). However, concentrations of total volatile fatty acids, acetic acid, propionic acid, and n-butyric acid were reduced by all the mixtures (P 0. 05). In conclusion, organic acids and salts were found to differ in their ability to modulate microbial fermentation in the digestive tract of piglets. Mixing formic acid with potassium sorbate or sodium benzoate changed fermentation patterns, and the possibility to use them to enhance the antimicrobial effect of formic acid should be investigated further in vivo. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of potassium sorbate as a preservative for stored corn at 18, 24, and 30 % moisture contents was studied. Growth and aflatoxin production by Aspergillus parasiticus decreased with increasing levels of sorbate treatment. The sorbate {{was more effective}} on corn with lower moisture contents and in sealed containers. The effect of potassium sorbate on growth and aflatoxin production by aflatoxin producing molds was studied {{in the presence of}} selected competing molds in yeast extract sucrose (YES) broth which were separated by a dialysis membrane (MWCO 12, 000). Growth of competing molds reduced growth and aflatoxin production by aflatoxin producing molds. The colonizing ability of aflatoxin producing molds in the presence of competing molds was studied on the surface of corn meal agar or corn kernels. Aspergillus flavus was more competitive on damaged corn kernels with 18 % moisture than on undamaged kernels with 26 % moisture. Aspergillus niger was the competing mold most effective in reducing growth and aflatoxin production by aflatoxin producing molds in YES broth with or without sorbate treatment. The presence of A. niger and sorbate had an additive effect in reducing aflatoxin production. A. niger was most competitive in YES broth containing 0. 25 % yeast extract and 20 % sucrose. Neither of the aflatoxin producing molds were competitive in glucose ammonium nitrate broth in all compositions studied. Potassium <b>sorbate,</b> <b>calcium</b> propionate, and natamycin were applied to non-sterilized corn kernels containing inoculated spores of A. flavus. All treatments increased the number of corn kernels dominated by A. flavus. Aflatoxin production was reduced by potassium <b>sorbate</b> and <b>calcium</b> propionate at the 0. 4 % level. When A. flavus and A. niger were inoculated on autoclaved corn, only treatment with potassium sorbate reduced the number of kernels dominated by A. flavus. Aflatoxin production was reduced by 0. 2 and 0. 4 % sorbate, and 0. 4 % calcium propionate. ...|$|R
