40|$|In some cases, it {{is clear}} that more than one {{constitutional}} argument will fairly lead to the same adjudicatory outcome. For the most part, courts choose exactly one of them, although in some cases they cumulate the converging arguments. When courts select just one, or at least fewer than all, on what basis do they, and should they, choose? Put tersely, what are the criteria for choosing among arguments that meet at the same outcome? The virtue of formulating this question by imposing the same-outcome constraint is that it requires us to look closely at exactly what distinguishes one argument from another. In particular, we have to determine their comparative suitability for being chosen as the operational argument that drives or explains the adjudicatory outcome. What are the criteria of such quality in arguments—for a given court or court level, for a given jurisdiction, for a given kind of problem—and so on? How to select legal arguments generally is a fairly standard jurisprudential issue, but the approach here is to adjust our focus for greater clarity by removing an often dazzling difference among arguments—their results. The reason for focusing on arguments in the first place is that, as I argue, the expression and operational meaning of a constitutional value is the argument that implements it—loosely, the argument is the value is the argument.... Because this Article’s chief vehicle for analysis is constitutional adjudication, most of the discussion is tied to U. S. Supreme Court cases. After explaining what is meant by certain key concepts, such as “the same adjudicatory outcome” and “fairly/plausibly reaching” the same adjudicatory outcome, I suggest a set of criteria, set at a midlevel theoretical plane, for selecting among converging arguments in constitutional adjudication. These criteria include the presentation, ratification, reinforcement, and implementation of constitutional values in ways that match the hierarchic value system embedded in the Constitution; the anticipation of “revenge effects” of adopting a given argument structure that is transplanted to a neighboring constitutional region; and the rational obstruction of dangerous insights by masking certain conflicts among basic values. Of course, the failure to select an argument structure in a given case, or even over a range of cases, is not necessarily a “rejection” of the values and frameworks embedded in the nonselected argument. The decisions not to adopt or even “list” the converging arguments rest on complex factors (including those affecting <b>collegial</b> <b>courts),</b> but here I address what I see as primary jurisprudential considerations—considerations that take account of our understandings (such as they are) of various aspects of human decision making. This Article deals with several objections to pursuing its topic, and then presents a series of examples: Police Department of Chicago v. Mosley, where I ask why the Equal Protection Clause was needed to vindicate the equality values ruled to be embedded within the First Amendment “on its own,” compare First Amendment with equal protection approaches, and thus press the more general examination of the entanglement of equality and liberty; Rochin v. California, where Justice Frankfurter’s version of due process competed with Justice Black’s and Justice Douglas’s approach favoring use of the constitutional protection against self-incrimination; the case of the Francophobic Assassin, in which a political assassination is defended by the assassin as First Amendment expression; a collection of equal protection problems involving searches for suspects, race wars in prison, school segregation, medical measures, and race and affirmative action in education and labor; the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its rival Commerce Clause and Fourteenth Amendment, § 5 rationales; and City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., concerning the location of sex-oriented movie theatres. In keeping with the idea that constitutional values are implemented in part by the presentation of arguments, I ask to what extent courts should be explicit in addressing how they choose among converging arguments, and contrast this question with asking whether the convergence of “higher theories” on a given argument similarly requires extended attention. For the former, I suggest that explicitness is what is presumptively required by the very existence of constitutional values that are meant to be implemented. For the latter, I suggest that ordinarily {{there is no need for}} devolving to higher theory or “foundations. ...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} celebrated Talmudic parables begins with a remarkably dry legal issue debated among a group of rabbis.

Case location and dispositional voting split the Court into two groups, a dispositional majority and a dispositional minority; bargaining over opinion content occurs only among those judges in the dispositional majority. Within that group, an assignment advantage arises endogenously in the model.

40|$|Appellate courts make policy, {{not only}} by hearing cases themselves, but by {{establishing}} legal rulesfor the disposition of future cases. The problem is that such courts are generally multimember, orcollegial, courts. If different judges prefer different rules, can a <b>collegial</b> <b>court</b> establish meaningful legal rules? Can preferences that {{take the form of}} legal rules be aggregated? I use a “case-space ” model to show that there will exist a collegial rule that captures majoritarian preferences, and to show that there will exist a median rule even if there is no single median judge. I show how collegial rules can differ from the rules of individual judges and how judicial institutions (such as appellate review and the power to write separate opinions) affect the stability and enforceability of legal rules. These results are discussed in light of fundamental debates between legal and political perspectives on judicial behavior. U ltimate power over legal policy in the UnitedStates lies mainly in appellate courts, particu-larly the Supreme Court. These courts do not and could not hear all cases themselves. Rather, ap-pellate courts make policy by laying down rules for disposing of cases, rules that the lower court judges who hear the vast majority of cases are to apply in their decisions. The problem is that, in the United States and many other countries, appellate courts are multimember...|$|E
40|$|Social choice {{theory is}} the study of {{collective}} decision procedures. It is not a single theory, but a cluster of models and results concerning the aggregation of individual inputs (e. g., votes, preferences, judgments, welfare) into collective outputs (e. g., collective decisions, preferences, judgments, welfare). Central questions are: How can a group of individuals choose a winning outcome (e. g., policy, electoral candidate) from a given set of options? What are the properties of different voting systems? When is a voting system democratic? How can a collective (e. g., electorate, legislature, <b>collegial</b> <b>court,</b> expert panel, or committee) arrive at coherent collective preferences or judgments on some issues, {{on the basis of its}} members ’ individual preferences or judgments? How can we rank different social alternatives in an order of social welfare? Social choice theorists study these questions not just by looking at examples, but by developing general models and proving theorems. Pioneered in the 18 th century by Nicolas de Condorcet and Jean-Charles de Borda and in the 19 th century by Charles Dodgson (also known as Lewis Carroll), social choice theory took off in the 20 th century with the works of Kenneth Arrow, Amartya Sen, and Duncan Black. Its influence extends across economics, political science, philosophy, mathematics, and recently computer science and biology. Apart from contributing to our understanding of collective decision procedures, social choice theory has applications in the areas of institutional design, welfare economics, and social epistemology...|$|E

Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes {{is best known for his}} many dissenting opinions while on the Supreme Court. He was one of the first Justices to give the dissenting opinion legitimacy and to make it into a powerful force that can change the law. Justice Holmes spent much of his thirty-year term on the Supreme Court dissenting against the use ofthe Fourteenth Amendment to invalidate laws passed by state and federal legislatures. In the end, Holmes 2 ̆ 7 view and his dissent prevailed. Beginning in 1941, Justice Harlan Fisk Stone served as ChiefJustice of the Supreme Court. Once in this position, Stone made the Court a body that encouraged individual Justices to express their opinions even when they were not the opinions of the majority. During Stone 2 ̆ 7 s five years as Chief Justice, the rate at which there was dissension more than doubled.

How does this collegiality affect their choice of legal doctrine? Can decisions by appellate courts be expected {{to result in a}} meaningful collegial rule? How do such collegial rules differ from the rules of individual judges? We explore these questions and show that collegiality has important implications for the structure and content of legal rules, {{as well as for the}} coherence, determinacy, and complexity of legal doctrine. We provide conditions for the occurrence of these doctrinal attributes in the output of collegial courts. Finally, we consider the connection between the problems that arise in the collegial aggregation of a set of legal rules and those previously noted in the collegial application of a single, fixed legal rule. A lone judge deciding all cases herself could face a task overwhelming in practice, but straight-forward in theory—she could simply decide all cases as she saw fit according to whatever rule she thought correct. Judges on a collegial (multimember) court, however, face further challenges that inhere in collegiality itself. One possible challenge is the application of existing legal rules. Kornhauser and Sager noted back in 1986 that ‘‘traditional theories of adjudica-tion are curiously incomplete,’ ’ in that they treat judging only as a solitary act, and ignore the collegial nature of most appellate courts. 1 They showed that if the judges on a <b>collegial</b> <b>court</b> are applying a single, fixed legal rule, and if they disagree over the legal subfindings in a case, then it matters how they aggregate their judgments over those subfindings under the fixed legal rule. This result was later named the Doctrinal Paradox, and it inspired a growing body of literature on collegial application of a fixed legal rule, spanning legal theory, social choice theory, and deliberative democratic theory (e. g., Chapman 1998...|$|E
40|$|This thesis explores tools used {{by federal}} lower court judges when {{deciding}} {{cases in the}} face of divergent political preferences. I show that judges make use of procedural 2 ̆ 2 outs, 2 ̆ 2 doctrines to do with judicial power, as a means of dealing with political conflict. This manifests both as a response to collegial conflict, allowing judges to come to agreement on a single opinion, and also as a response to hierarchical conflict, allowing lower court judges to assert power over the policy agendas of higher court judges by limiting issues before the court. Analysis of behavior in appellate panels supports the theory that judges avoid ideological conflict with colleagues by writing procedural decisions instead of reaching the substantive issues in the case. Thus, appellate panels {{with a wide range of}} ideological views more often refuse to reach the merits of a dispute than ideologically aligned panels. This avoidance behavior leads to opinions based in procedural law. These findings indicate that procedural law plays an important role in <b>collegial</b> <b>court</b> decision making by allowing judges with conflicting political preferences to resolve disputes in a way that sidesteps conflict. Further, district court judges sitting beneath ideologically 2 ̆ 2 hostile 2 ̆ 2 appellate courts are far more likely to render narrow 2 ̆ 2 procedural 2 ̆ 2 decisions that sidestep the substantive issues posed by a case than district court judges who are ideologically aligned with the relevant appellate circuit. This behavior has consequences for the availability of issues to higher courts as appellate judges will generally refrain from reaching the merits of a dispute unless the district court has already done so. In sum, then, this thesis provides empirical support for the idea that political conflict may lead to one form of judicial minimalism; however, such conflict may also account for incoherence and inconsistencies in the application of the rules about judicial power. Overall, a goal of this thesis is to begin to explain the complex set of forces that govern the content of opinions rather than maintaining a hard focus on outcomes alone...|$|E
