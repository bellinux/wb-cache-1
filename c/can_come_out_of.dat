We propose an energy-aware with mobility-assisted geographic routing protocol for mobile ad hoc networks (EAGRP) that increases accuracy and reduces energy consumption in transmission of packets by considering local position information and residual energy levels of nodes to make routing decisions. Simulation results shows that proposed approach has a good energy conservation performance and also performs better in context of average end-to-end delay without much affecting the throughput...|$|R
