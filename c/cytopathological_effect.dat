Herein, we present a three-year-old girl, who was previously vaccinated against mumps infection, admitted with bilateral parotid swelling, dactylitis and serum immunoglobulin M positivity for mumps infection and diagnosed to have ALL with bilateral persistent parotid involvement, inconsistent with mumps infection. Acute leukemia should be suspected during the atypical course of any disease during childhood.

The result of AV infection in the hosts is cleavage of infected cells into vesicles, a unique feature of AV infection. Since insect cell lines facilitate the study of virus life cycles, {{attempts were made to}} analyze Heliothis virescens AV (HvAV 3 e) infection in several cell lines and compare cell pathology to larval infection. In this study, replication and <b>cytopathological</b> <b>effects</b> of HvAV 3 e on four different cell lines were investigated. HvAV 3 e replication was confirmed in three noctuid cell lines from Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf 9) and Helicoverpa zea (BCIRL-Hz-AM 1 and FB 33). However, the virus did not replicate in the non-noctuid insect cell line from Pieris rapae (Pieridae).

40|$|Lysinibacillus sphaericus (Ls) strains {{that produce}} insecticidal {{proteins}} show high activity against mosquito larvae. The most active {{of these is}} the binary (Bin) toxin that acts following ingestion and, after midgut processing and binding to specific receptors, provokes <b>cytopathological</b> <b>effects</b> and leads to larval death. Bin toxin displays specific action against some species of medical importance (e. g. Culex and Anopheles) and it is safe to non-target organisms. These features have led to the production of biolarvicides based on this bacterium and its effectiveness to control mosquito larvae has been widely related in the literature. The field utilisation of Ls has also shown that resistance could be selected among exposed populations and the mechanisms and genes involved in this process have been described.

40|$|Some {{biological}} {{characteristics and}} bioassay of a polyhedral virus isolated from normal-appearing strain HB- 301 of Entamoeba histolytica are described. The virus produced lysis of susceptible strains of E. histolytica, yet it caused no <b>cytopathological</b> <b>effect</b> {{in the host}} strain, HB- 301. The virus and host amoeba existed in an equilibrium; approximately 104 mean infective dose units of virus were produced per million HB- 301 amoebae. Superinfection and antiviral antiserum treatment failed to disturb this equilibrium permanently. The mechanism of viral persistence in strain HB- 301 amoebae remains to be determined. Purification of the virus was attempted. Ninety-nine percent of the viral infectivity {{was associated with a}} low-speed pellet which consisted of complexes of virus and cellular membranes.

40|$|Abstract Background Hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{infection}} is of growing concern {{in public health}} with around 350 million chronically infected individuals worldwide. Although the IFN-α/rivabirin is the only approved therapy with 10 – 30 % clinical efficacy, the protective molecular mechanism involved during the treatment is still unknown. To analyze the effect of HCV polyprotein expression on the antiviral response of the host, we developed a novel vaccinia virus (VV) -based delivery system (VT 7 -HCV 7. 9) where structural and nonstructural (except part of NS 5 B) proteins of HCV ORF from genotype 1 b are efficiently expressed and produced, and timely regulated in mammalian cell lines. Results Regulated transcript production and viral polypeptide processing was demonstrated in various cell lines infected with the recombinant VT 7 -HCV 7. 9, indicating that the cellular and viral proteolytic machineries are functional within these cells. The inducible expression of the HCV polyprotein by VV inhibits the synthesis of both host and viral proteins over the time and also induces apoptosis in HeLa and HepG 2 -infected cells. These effects occur accompanying with the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF- 2 α. In cells co-infected with VT 7 -HCV 7. 9 and a recombinant VV expressing the dominant negative eIF- 2 α-S 51 A mutant {{in the presence of}} the inductor isopropyl-thiogalactoside (IPTG), protein synthesis is rescued. The IFN-inducible protein kinase PKR is responsible for the translational block, as demonstrated with PKR-/- and PKR+/+ cell lines. However, apoptosis induced by VT 7 -HCV 7. 9 is mediated by the RNase L pathway, in a PKR-independent manner. Conclusion These findings demonstrate the antiviral relevance of the proteins induced by interferon, PKR and RNase L during expression from a VV recombinant of the HCV polyprotein in human cell lines. HCV polyprotein expression caused a severe <b>cytopathological</b> <b>effect</b> in human cells as a result of inhibition of protein synthesis and apoptosis induction, triggered by the activation of the IFN-induced enzymes PKR and RNase L systems. Thus, the virus-cell system described here highlights the relevance of the IFN system as a protective mechanism against HCV infection. </p...|$|E
40|$|Bean {{leaves that}} had been doubly {{infected}} systemically with the legume strain of tobacco mosaic virus (CP-TMV) and bean golden mosaic virus (BGMV) were studied ultrastructurally. Virus particles and the cytopathological changes associated with each virus in single infections occurred within the same cell when plants were doubly infected, indicating that individual systemically infected host cells can multiply viruses of different nucleic acid composition. Although the cytopathic effects induced by BGMV are limited to phloem-associated c lls in singly infected plants, he same effects were found in most leaf cell types in mixedly infected plants. Mixed infections by plant viruses are common but have been relatively little studied (Matthews, 1981). Thus, information concerning the ultrastructure of mixed virus infections is sparse, although recent reports by Gill & Chong (1981) and Carr & Kim (1983), indicate that ultrastructural features in mixedly infected cells {{may be useful in}} discriminating related viruses or strains of the same virus.

We {{compared}} the oncolytic potential of MV in two B-cell malignancies; adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, an aggressive leukemia) and {{chronic lymphocytic leukemia}} (CLL, an indolent leukemia overexpressing Bcl- 2) using patient-derived material. In vitro, distinct <b>cytopathological</b> <b>effects</b> were observed between MV-infected primary ALL and CLL cells, with large multinucleated syncytia forming in ALL cultures compared to minimal cell-to-cell fusion in infected CLL cells. Cell viability and immunoblotting studies confirmed rapid cell death in MV-infected ALL cultures and slower MV oncolysis of CLL cells. In cell lines, overexpression of Bcl- 2 diminished MV-induced cell death providing a possible mechanism for the slower kinetic of MV oncolysis in CLL. In vivo, intratumoral MV treatment of established subcutaneous ALL xenografts had striking antitumor activity leading to complete resolution of all tumors. The antitumor activity of MV was also evident in disseminated ALL xenograft models. In summary, both ALL and CLL are targets for MV-mediated lysis albeit with different kinetics. The marked sensitivity of both primary ALL cells and ALL xenografts to MV oncolysis highlights the tremendous potential of MV as a novel replicating-virus therapy for adult AL...|$|R

There are increasing bodies of evidence indicating that aldehydic molecules generated endogenously {{during the process of}} lipid peroxidation are causally involved in most of the pathophysiological effects associated with oxidative stress in cells and tissues. 4 -Hydroxy- 2 -nonenal (4 -HNE), among them, is believed to be largely responsible for <b>cytopathological</b> <b>effects</b> observed during oxidative stress in vivo and has achieved the status of one of the best recognized and most studied of the cytotoxic products of lipid peroxidation. Here, we reported that 4 -HNE treatment may induce cell death in MG 63 human osteosarcoma cells. The 4 -HNE treatment could activate caspase- 3 and alter the Bax/Bcl- 2 apoptotic signaling. All these changes are due to the inhibition of AKT activity by 4 -HNE treatment, and we also found that the p 70 S 6 K activity, downstream factors of AKT, was also blocked by 4 -HNE.

The symptoms on infected host larvae of the host, compared with healthy ones, were getting swollen with milky-white and fragile Histopathological examinations showed infection with HaCPV small polyhedral inclusion bodies (PIB) after 1 or 2 days which were observed in columnar cells of midgut. Virions were partially or completely occupied in a polyhedral matrix to form polyhedral inclusion bodies (PIB) at periphery of virogenic stroma. PIBs were measured 0. 5 to 3. 5 mm and virions about 46 nm in diameter. Microvilli of infected columnar cells were affected and degenerated immediately prior to rupture of the cell. Some infected columnar cells ruptured to release PIB into the gut lumen 3 days after infection. In addition,PIB were found in goblet cells, 5 or 6 days after infection. Infected goblet cells degenerate {{to such an extent}} that only a few of the original microvillus-like cytoplasmic projections and cell organells were left.

Both species have been characterised using limited morphology, and molecular data from PCR amplified fragments of the 18 S rRNA gene. However, no ultrastructural work has been performed thus far. The {{aim of this study}} was to add descriptive information on the two species by studying their ultrastructural morphology. Mature gamont stages, common in the peripheral blood of infected frogs, were examined by transmission electron microscopy. Results indicate that H.  ixoxo and H.  theileri share typical apicomplexan characteristics, but differ markedly in their external cellular structure. Hepatozoon ixoxo is an encapsulated parasite presenting a prominent cap at the truncate pole, and shows no visible modifications to the host cell membrane. In comparison, H.  theileri does not present a capsule or cap, and produces marked morphological changes to its host cell.

40|$|Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is hepatotropic and {{frequently}} causes fulminant hepatitis in {{both human and}} nonhuman primate hosts. To understand the molecular basis of HDV tissue tropism and the mechanism of pathogenesis, transgenic mice in which replication-competent HDV dimeric RNA is expressed {{under the control of}} either liver-specific or universal transcriptional promoters were developed. The expressed RNA replicated efficiently in the liver and several tissues of nonhepatic origin. Surprisingly, maximal replication of HDV RNA occurred in skeletal muscle and was almost 100 -fold greater than in the liver. These findings suggest that the hepatotropism of HDV is most likely a receptor-mediated restriction and that muscle-specific factors may facilitate HDV RNA replication. No evidence of cytopathology was apparent in most of the tissues examined, including the liver, supporting the contention that hepatocellular disease is not mediated by direct <b>cytopathological</b> <b>effects</b> associated with HDV RNA replication and gene expression. However, mild muscle atrophy in some of the transgenic mice was noted. Delta antigen was detected in the nuclei of myocytes. Only the small form, not the large form, of delta antigen was detected, suggesting that the RNA editing event which causes the conversion of delta antigen did not occur in transgenic mice. Furthermore, the 0. 8 -kb antigenomic RNA species, which is postulated to be the mRNA for delta antigen, was not detected in mice.

The ability of eight PA congeners to inhibit mitosis and induce megalocyte formation in cultured bovine kidney epithelial cells was studied to examine possible structural influences on these endpoints. Representatives of the three PA structural groups, the macrocycles (seneciphylline, senecionine, riddelliine, retrorsine, monocrotaline), open diesters (heliosupine, latifoline), and a necine base (retronecine), were cocultured for 2 hr with a NADPH-generating system and rat liver S 9. Macrocylic PAs with αβ-unsaturation (seneciphylline, senecionine, riddelliine, retrorsine) showed a dose-dependent inhibition of colony formation at 50, 100, and 300 μM and induction of megalocytosis at 500 μM. Colony growth resumed 3 weeks after removal of PAs at 50 and 100 μM, and normal cellular morphology returned 5 or 6 weeks after removal of PAs at 500 μM. The saturated macrocyclic (monocrotaline) and open diesters (heliosupine, latifoline), elicited only a slight inhibition of colony formation and had no effect on cellular morphology at 500 μM.

Pyrrolic PAs (dehydrosenecionine, dehydromonocrotaline, dehydroretronecine) were more active in inhibition of colony formation than their parent compounds and were potent inducers of abnormal cellular morphology at 500 μM.

40|$|Lettuce {{infectious}} yellows virus (LIYV) is {{the type}} member of the genus Crinivirus in the family Closteroviridae. Like many other positive-strand RNA viruses, LIYV infections induce a number of cytopathic changes in plant cells, of which the two most characteristic are: Beet yellows virus-type inclusion bodies composed of vesicles derived from cytoplasmic membranes; and conical plasmalemma deposits (PLDs) located at the plasmalemma over plasmodesmata pit fields. The former are not only found in various closterovirus infections, but similar structures are known as ‘viral factories’ or viroplasms in cells infected with diverse types of animal and plant viruses. These are generally sites of virus replication, virion assembly {{and in some cases}} are involved in cell-to-cell transport. By contrast, PLDs induced by the LIYV-encoded P 26 non-virion protein are not involved in replication but are speculated to have roles in virus intercellular movement. These deposits often harbor LIYV virions arranged to be perpendicular to the plasma membrane over plasmodesmata, and our recent studies show that P 26 is required for LIYV systemic plant infection. The functional mechanism of how LIYV P 26 facilitates intercellular movement remains unclear, however, research on other plant viruses provides some insights on the possible ways of viral intercellular movement through targeting and modifying plasmodesmata via interactions between plant cellular components and viral-encoded factors. In summary, beginning with LIYV, we review the studies that have uncovered the biological determinants giving rise to these <b>cytopathological</b> <b>effects</b> and their importance in viral replication, virion assembly and intercellular movement during the plant infection by closteroviruses, and compare these findings with those for other positive-strand RNA viruses...|$|R

These effects were similar in Bin-toxin-susceptible and -resistant larvae and demonstrated that Cry 48 Aa/Cry 49 Aa toxin interacts with and displays toxic effects on cells lacking receptors for the Bin toxin, while B. sphaericus IAB 59 -resistant larvae did not show mortality after treatment with Cry 48 Aa/Cry 49 Aa toxin. The cytopathological alterations in Bin-toxin-resistant larvae provoked by Cry 48 Aa/Cry 49 Aa treatment were similar to those observed when larvae were exposed to a synergistic mixture of Bin/Cry 11 Aa toxins.

In contrast, hepatocytes of rainbow trout and zebra fish clearly display dose-dependent and species-specific <b>cytopathological</b> <b>effects</b> at 40 and 1000 micrograms/l, respectively. In rainbow trout (model 1), rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) appears of particular diagnostic value {{for the effects of}} atrazine, since it already shows a full spectrum of cytological alterations after 40 micrograms/l, and since in cells without RER modifications no further cytopathological symptoms can be revealed. At 40 micrograms/l atrazine, further changes include disturbance of the intracellular compartmentation, increased heterogeneity of mitochondria (longitudinally arranged cristae, branching, size), formation of myelinated bodies as well as immigration of macrophages and granulocytes along the biliary system and the space of Disse. The separation of peripheral storage areas from the central organelle-containing cytoplasm is no longer evident at 80 micrograms/l, and the phagocytic activity of invading macrophages is drastically increased. Following exposure to 160 micrograms/l atrazine, additional pathological changes comprise clubshaped deformation of mitochondria, formation of myelinated bodies in the intermembranous space of mitochondria, increase of degranulated ER cisternae and lysosomes, as well as perisinusoidal accumulation of lipid droplets. Deformation of the nuclear envelope, elevated mitotic activity and an increased number of nuclei with two or more nucleoli indicate interactions between atrazine and the nucleus. In the liver of female zebra fish (model 2), atrazine-induced alterations are limited to increased parenchymal variability, disturbance of the intracellular compartmentation, partial RER fractionation and vesiculation, club-shaped deformation of mitochondria and {{an increase in the number}} of lysosomes, myelinated bodies and invading macrophages at 1000 micrograms/l atrazine. After three months at 10, 000 micrograms/l, mortality of zebra fish is increased to 100 %. According to cytopathological alterations of hepatocytes following long-term exposure, susceptibility of the test model rainbow trout to atrazine appears higher than that of the model zebra fish...|$|R
40|$|Redox {{imbalance}} in biological systems {{is associated with}} a complex interplay of oxidative pathways leading to more or less extensive degradation and breakdown of important cellular constituents including chiefly lipids, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), as well as carbohydrates and proteins, among others. PUFA oxidation is a central event in lipid peroxidation and {{is associated with a}} chain reaction involving peroxide intermediates. These latter eventually break down to give α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, including 4 -hydroxy- 2 -nonenal (HNE), acrolein, crotonaldehyde, and dialdehydes, such as malondialdehyde, glyoxal and methylglyoxal. Oxidative stressrelated aldehydes (OSRAs) are currently recognized to play a complex and crucial role in the onset and progression of several disease states, including vascular diseases, neurodegeneration and cancer. An important role of aldehydes in lipofuscinogenesis and age-related disorders has also been demonstrated. Besides being the measurable end product of lipid peroxidation and oxidative cell injury, aldehydes can act themselves as amplifiers of damaging events through covalent reaction with cellular targets such as proteins and nucleic acids. HNE, for example, has been implicated in a variety of <b>cytopathological</b> <b>effects</b> associated to oxidative stress and is currently one of the best recognized and most studied cytotoxic products of lipid peroxidation. The ability of glyoxal to cause interstrand DNA crosslinks is another remarkable example for the active role of aldehydes in mediating toxic mechanism in disease states, and the activation of the glyoxalase system to control glyoxal-mediated cell damage is indirect evidence of the impact of these processes on the progression of disease. Several conditions have been associated with an increase in the levels of endogenous aldehydes, including Fanconi anaemia, and the impact of this phenomenon may vary from one disease to the other depending on levels and potential targets involved, as well as the underlying specific pathways of toxicity. Starting from an initial survey of the basic mechanisms of aldehyde generation from lipid peroxidation and other oxidative processes following the onset of redox imbalance, this chapter aims at addressing a number of central issues in oxidative stress-related disorders: 1) what are the mechanisms of OSRAs toxicity in the progression and final outcome of the disease? 2) What are the main targets of OSRAs and {{what is the role of}} these interactions in the etiopathogenesis of oxidative stress-related disease states? 3) Can OSRA quantitation yield clues about the advancement and outcome of diseases? Far from being comprehensive, the present survey seeks rather to provide an inspiring and critical perspective of the biomedical relevance of aldehydes as markers of redox imbalance and their potential diagnostic and prognostic value with special reference to Fanconi anaemia and rare cancer-prone disease...|$|R
30|$|To {{identify}} key structure(s) for {{activity and}} selectivity, the next structure–activity relationship {{study was conducted}} using analogs of the isolated compounds. Results are presented in Table  3 as IC 50 values. Betulin (4) exhibited potent activity with IC 50 of 18.3  μM, but was more toxic to host cells (SI[*]=[*] 0.3). Oleanolic acid (8) and ursolic acid (9) showed similar activity to their acetates (2 and 3) but selective toxicities against T. gondii were impaired (SI[*]=[*] 1.8 and 1.2). Synthetic (3 β)-hydroxy- 30 -norlupan- 20 -one (7) as an analog of 29 -norlupane- 3, 20 -dione did not show inhibitory activity against T. gondii and host cells even at 1.0  mM. From the comparison between 1 and 3 and their analogs, it could be concluded {{that the presence of}} C- 3 hydroxyl group decreases the selectivity against T. gondii whereas acetylation or oxidation to carbonyl enables lowering toxicity against host cells. Capping or oxidizing free hydroxyl group at C- 3 would elevate the anti-toxoplasma activity itself, as clearly seen in the comparison between 1 and 7, or 2 and 8. The inferior activity and selectivity of maslinic acid follow these trends. On the other hand, ursolic acid (9) exceptionally retains high anti-toxoplasma activity regardless of its free 3 -hydroxyl group, while the selective toxicity of 9 was comparable to 8. Non-selective toxicities of 9 and maslinic acid suggest that inhibitory activity against protease might correlate with non-selective toxicities of these oleananes [15]. Functionalities around E-ring seem to have a crucial impact on activity, as observed in the case of betulin (4) that shows potent activity despite its structural analogy to inactive compound 7. Although stringent comparison is difficult with the present compounds, high polar functionality, such as carboxyl or hydroxyl group on E-ring, might contribute to notable activities of 2, 3, 4 and 8. Blockage of gliding motility of T. gondii tachyzoites was observed by treating with maslinic acid. One of the action mechanisms of maslinic acid may exert on the tachyzoites in their interaction with the host cell via protease. Maslinic acid and other protease inhibitors cause <b>cytopathological</b> <b>effects</b> on intra- and extracellular forms of the parasite, too [15]. Compound 8 is 2 -deoxy analog of maslinic acid, thus it might have the same molecular target as maslinic acid. The isolated compounds 1, 2, and 3 may have different mode of action due to their higher selective indexes in comparison with maslinic acid and 8. The findings from this structure–activity relationship study would be highly beneficial for the development of new anti-toxoplasma drugs with high efficacy and high selectivity. In addition, derivatization of betulin, the most abundant extract in Betula platyphylla outer bark, could quantitatively provide such useful drug candidates.|$|R
40|$|Anatomical and {{developmental}} tissue relationships between Arceuthobium spp. endophytic tissues and host vascular tissues were examined by light and transmission electron microscopes. The host-parasite pairs studied were Psudotsuga menziesii/A. douglasii, Tsuga heterophylla/A. tsugense, Pinus sabiniana/A. occidentale, and P. lambertiana/A. californicum. The morphological form and growth characteristics of A. douglasii in different aged host tissues {{was found to}} be coordinated with growth and maturation of the host. It is proposed that morphological forms of Arceuthobium endophytic tissue be categorized as (1) primary, (2) diffuse-secondary, or (3) localized-secondary in order to semantically clarify the relationship of endophytic morphology with primary or secondary growth stages of host tissue. In localized-secondary endophytic forms, the parasite integrates with host rays to form multiseriate infected rays. At both the light and electron microscope level, parasite cells can usually be identified by their distinctive chromocentric nuclei and abundant lipid bodies or lipid ghosts. Sinker cells of Arceuthobium have unusual plastids which resemble etioplasts and which do not store starch. Sinker cells have distinctive mitochondria with unusually large nucleoid areas. They have abundant endoplasmic reticulum. Wall/plasmalemma specializations increase the membrane surface area in relation to cell volume in sinker cells. The walls of host and parasite are fused at the middle lamella common to both organisms and the organisms share a common apoplast. Pit-like regions in the fused walls of the host/parasite interface were commonly seen in light microscope studies, although such interspecific pitting is seen less than intraspecific pitting. It was determined that, whereas intraspecific pits are traversed by complete plasmodesmata, interspecific pits had no plasmatic channels, or, only half plasmodesmata on the host side of the pit. In one case a half plasmodesmata was seen on the Arceuthobium side of the host/parasite interface. On the basis of the electron microscope studies of the host/parasite interface it appears that plasmatic connections between host and parasite do not normally occur. Because of this plasmatic isolation it can be concluded that nutrient acquisition does not involve direct flow of nutrients via interspecific symplastic bridges. Therefore, photosynthate, normally housed within phloem cells, must be leaked into the common apoplast of both host and parasite before becoming available for absorption into the parasite symplast. Since host and parasite lack symplastic continuity but share a common apoplast, apoplastically-mobile herbicides should be tested for their ability to accumulate in parasite tissues. <b>Cytopathological</b> <b>effects</b> on the host cells were relatively mild although {{a significant increase in the}} ratio of radial to axillary vasculature was noted in infected tissue. Other modifications included a tendency for increased numbers of specialized phloem parenchyma (Strasburger cells) in infected rays. No apparent anomalies were observed in conjunction with host sieve cell structure and development. The structure and ontogeny of healthy P. sabiniana phloem was also studied. It was found that the sieve element reticulum (SER) of mature sieve cells is derived from plastids during the maturation of the sieve cell. After maturation some of the SER membranes seem to disassociate into individual 60 (ANGSTROM) fibrils. These fibrils then reassociate and appear to be condensed into paracrystalline bodies which, in turn, participate in the generation of new membranes in the mature sieve cell. Because of their plastid origin, the SER membranes may have energy transducing and ionic pump capabilities that commonly are associated with plastid membranes. Such specialized functions of SER may contribute to the translocating capacities of sieve cells...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{and compare the}} <b>cytopathological</b> and clinical <b>effects</b> of amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) and oral mucosal membrane transplantation (OMMT) in socket contraction. METHODS: Twelve patients {{who could not be}} fitted with ocular prosthesis due to socket contracture were included in this study. Seven patients underwent AMT and 5 patients underwent OMMT. Thirteen patients who had healthy sockets were included as control group. Depth of inferior fornix, degree of inflammation, extent of the socket contracture and socket volume were measured in the preoperative period and at sixth and twelfth weeks postoperatively. Impression cytology of conjunctival fornices and tear transforming growth factor beta- 1 (TGFβ 1) levels were determined. RESULTS: In the AMT group,socket volume and lower fornix depth values were significantly higher (P = 0. 030 and P = 0. 004 respectively) and inflammation levels and impression cytology stages (P = 0. 037 and P = 0. 022 respectively) were significantly lower in postoperative period compared to preoperative period. In the OMMT group, no statistical differences were found in terms of clinical parameters, inflammation levels and impression cytology stages of preoperative versus postoperative values. Preoperative tear TGFβ 1 levels were higher in AMT and OMMT groups compared to the control group (25. 5 ng/mL, 26. 3 ng/mL and 21. 7 ng/mL respectively). Decreased tear TGFβ 1 levels were observed in both the AMT and OMMT groups postoperatively (median decrease value= 2. 1 ng/mL and 2. 7 ng/mL respectively). CONCLUSION: AMT is associated with postoperative improvement in inferior fornix depth, socket volume, inflammation and impression cytology levels and may be a more proper alternative method than OMMT in the management of socket contracture...|$|R
