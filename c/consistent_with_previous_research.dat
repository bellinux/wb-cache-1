This result is <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>previous</b> <b>researches,</b> which find that informed trading reduces liquidity. Second, this report explores the direct relation between price efficiency and liquidity by applying a cross-sectional regression. The result indicates that liquidity associated with asymmetric information effects enhances pricing efficiency. The cross-sectional relation between relative informational efficiency and liquidity combed with informed trading is significantly positive. Third, we find that pure liquidity trading also contributes to price informativeness. The positive relation between relative informational efficiency and liquidity unrelated to asymmetric information cannot be rejected...|$|R
30|$|We {{make use}} of several {{combined}} datasets from the Public Use Micro Statistics (PUMS), 5  % sample from the US Census, which allow us to exploit variations across more than 475 detailed occupations by industry categories across time. We find that <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>previous</b> <b>researches,</b> there is an inverse relationship between an increase of Mexican immigrants in an occupation/industry and wages of African-Americans, suggestive of a potential for crowding out effect and substitution effect. The relevant relation between wages of African-Americans and Mexican immigrants appears {{not limited to the}} unskilled sectors. We find that Mexican immigrants have an impact on wages of workers in occupations in semi-skilled range (in which the average African-American workers have a high school diploma). At very high skill occupation range (those in which the average African-American workers have a college education), the lack of the presence of Mexican immigrants in those occupations corresponds to higher wages, suggestive of more complementarity in the production process among more-educated workers.|$|R

40|$|Great {{attention}} has been paid to carbon bio-sequestration due to increasing concerns over global warming. Understanding the relationship between carbon bio-sequestration and its influencing factors is of great significance for formulating appropriate management measures for global warming mitigation. Since change in carbon bio-sequestration is a complex process, it is difficult to take into account all of its influencing factors, while the panel data model may provide an effective way to measure their subtle effects. In this paper, decomposition analysis is applied to further analyze these influencing factors. The results indicate that climatic, demographic and geographical variables play important roles in explaining the spatial heterogeneity of carbon bio-sequestration in China, which is <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>previous</b> <b>researches.</b> Meanwhile, the irrigation rate is found to be the most critical factor influencing carbon bio-sequestration changes, followed by climatic and economic factors.

50|$|Some {{research}} has explored base rate neglect in children, {{as there was}} a lack of understanding about how these judgment heuristics develop. The authors of one such study wanted to understand the development of the heuristic, if it differs between social judgments and other judgments, and whether children use base rates when they are not using the representativeness heuristic. The authors found that the use of the representativeness heuristic as a strategy begins early on and is consistent. The authors also found that children use idiosyncratic strategies to make social judgments initially, and use base rates more as they get older, but the use of the representativeness heuristic in the social arena also increase as they get older. The authors found that, among the children surveyed, base rates were more readily used in judgments about objects than in social judgments. After that research was conducted, Davidson (1995) was interested in exploring how the representativeness heuristic and conjunction fallacy in children related to children’s stereotyping. <b>Consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>previous</b> <b>research,</b> children based their responses to problems off of base rates when the problems contained nonstereotypic information or when the children were older. There was also evidence that children commit the conjunction fallacy. Finally, as students get older, they used the representativeness heuristic on stereotyped problems, and so made judgments consistent with stereotypes. There is evidence that even children use the representativeness heuristic, commit the conjunction fallacy, and disregard base rates.|$|E
40|$|The present paper aims to {{investigate}} the relative sea-level and the coastal evolution during the Holocene in the Rio de Janeiro coastline, based on geological and biological indicators. Using topographic survey, excavation and coring, and 14 C dating of these coastal deposits and beachrocks outcrops, we have reconstructed a sea-level curve for the Holocene. For {{the first time on}} the Brazilian coast it was identified a negative record of relative sea-level during Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene transition.

At approximately at 8500 cal yr BP, the sea-level was 0. 5 m below the current level, was overtaken {{for the first time in}} the Holocene, at approximately 7500 cal yr BP. The maximum level of + 2. 5 m was reached between 4770 and 4490 cal yr BP. At the point of maximum transgression, the sea-level began a general behavior of lowering until the present.

5000|$|There {{are many}} ways AUM theory can be applied. It can be {{effective}} in studying {{the behavior of a}} stranger adjusting to a new culture, as well as in examining how individuals communicate with strangers and often accurately predict their behavior; this is done when we are mindful. Gudykunst explains that some axioms can be combined to form theorems. These theorems that are generated might be <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>previous</b> <b>research,</b> while others might be useful for future study. He notes that not all axioms can be combined to form a new theorem. Huber and Sorrentino differentiate between certainty-oriented individuals and uncertainty-oriented individuals and argue that theories of interpersonal and intergroup relations have an [...] "uncertainty orientation" [...] bias. Gudykunst gives three reasons why AUM theory is not limited to uncertainty-oriented individuals. First, uncertainty-orientation is incorporated into the theory. Second, the superficial causes or factors that influence our uncertainty in a situation influence the amount of uncertainty we feel. Lastly, our personality characteristics influence our behavior only when we are not mindful. Gudykunst also defends the number of axioms in the theory because when the goal of a theory is to improve communication, one cannot afford to be vague. Gudykunst acknowledges that there are certain areas where additional research is needed. For instance, one cannot always be mindful when communicating. Potential problems then refer to the recognition of instances in which mindfulness is needed and defining the optimal levels of anxiety or uncertainty. Future research needs to develop ways to measure an individual's minimum and maximum thresholds of uncertainty and anxiety {{in the same way that}} anxiety and uncertainty are measured. AUM theory is in a constant state of revision and even the current version of the theory is not complete.|$|E
5000|$|Recent {{research}} {{points at}} substantial {{differences in the}} cognitive styles of liberals and conservatives on psychological measures. For example, conservatives respond to threatening situations with more aggression than do liberals. Similarly, conservatives are more sensitive to threatening facial expressions. Jost and colleagues posed that political orientation is associated with psychological processes for managing fear and uncertainty A 2011 study by cognitive neuroscientist Ryota Kanai's group at University College London published in Current Biology, found a correlation between differences in political views and differences in brain structures in {{a convenience sample of}} students from University College London. The researchers performed MRI scans on the brains of 90 volunteer students who had indicated their political orientation on a five-point scale ranging from [...] "very liberal" [...] to [...] "very conservative". Students who reported more [...] "conservative" [...] political views tended to have larger amygdalae, a structure in the temporal lobes that performs a primary role in the processing and memory of emotions. In addition, they found clusters in which gray matter volume was significantly associated with conservativism in the left insula and the right entorhinal cortex. There is evidence that conservatives are more sensitive to disgust and the insula is involved in the feeling of disgust [...] On the other hand, more 'liberal' students tended to have a larger volume of grey matter in the anterior cingulate cortex, a structure of the brain associated with monitoring uncertainty and handling conflicting information. It is <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>previous</b> <b>research</b> suggesting that individuals with a larger ACC have a higher capacity to tolerate uncertainty and conflicts, allowing them to accept more liberal viewsThe authors concluded that, [...] "Although our data do not determine whether these regions play a causal role in the formation of political attitudes, they converge with previous work to suggest a possible link between brain structure and psychological mechanisms that mediate political attitudes." [...] In an interview with LiveScience, Ryota Kanai said, [...] "It's very unlikely that actual political orientation is directly encoded in these brain regions", and that, [...] "more work is needed to determine how these brain structures mediate the formation of political attitude." [...] Kanai and colleagues added {{that it is necessary to}} conduct a longitudinal study to determine whether the changes in brain structure that we observed lead to changes in political behavior or whether political attitudes and behavior instead result in changes of brain structure.|$|E
