30|$|Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) aims at {{improving}} the modularization {{of a system}} by providing language abstractions that are dedicated to modularize crosscutting <b>concerns</b> (CCs). CCs are <b>concerns</b> which cannot be accurately modularized by using conventional paradigms (Kiczales et al. 1997). Without proper language abstractions, crosscutting <b>concerns</b> become scattered and tangled with other <b>concerns</b> of the software, affecting maintainability and reusability. In AOP, there is usually a distinction between base <b>concerns</b> and crosscutting <b>concerns.</b> The base <b>concerns</b> (or Core-concerns) are those which the system was originally designed to deal with. The crosscutting <b>concerns</b> are the <b>concerns</b> which affect on other <b>concerns.</b> Examples of crosscutting <b>concerns</b> include global restrictions, data persistence, authentication, access control, concurrency and cryptography (Kiczales et al. 1997).|$|R

40|$|Objective 1) {{to assess}} patients’ {{descriptions}} of <b>concerns,</b> and 2) to inform {{a conceptual framework}} in which {{the impact of the}} nature of <b>concerns</b> on doctor-patient communication is specified. Methods Six focus groups were conducted with 39 cancer patients and survivors. In these focus groups participants were asked to describe their <b>concerns</b> during and after their illness. Results <b>Concerns</b> were described as instrumental <b>concerns</b> (e. g., receiving insufficient information) and emotions (e. g., sadness). Patients frequently explained their <b>concerns</b> as an interplay of instrumental <b>concerns</b> and emotions. Examples of the interplay were “receiving incorrect information” and “frustration”, and “difficulties with searching, finding and judging of information” and “fear”. Conclusion Instrumental <b>concerns</b> need {{to be taken into account}} in the operationalization of <b>concerns</b> in research. Based on the interplay, the conceptual framework suggests that patients can express instrumental <b>concerns</b> as emotions and emotions as instrumental <b>concerns.</b> Consequently, providers can respond with instrumental and emotional communication when patients express an interplay of <b>concerns.</b> Practice implications The results of this study can be used to support providers in recognizing <b>concerns</b> that are expressed by patients in consultations...|$|R

Background Terminally ill patients can experience many <b>concerns.</b> These <b>concerns</b> can affect the choices these patients make in their life and illnesses and it can affect {{the overall quality of}} life. Therefore it is necessary to gain insight in these <b>concerns.</b> Aim and research questions The propose of this research was to gain insight in the <b>concerns</b> that terminally ill patients experience. This description can possibly provide a lead for caretakers, so they can anticipate and open the discussion on these <b>concerns</b> with patients and other caretakers. The research question was: Which <b>concerns</b> experience terminally ill patients and how do patients deal with these <b>concerns?</b> Method A qualitative descriptive design was used. To collect data 11 semi structured interviews were held. The study population were terminally ill hospice patients. Data was analyzed by using open, selective and axial coding. Results The <b>concerns</b> that respondents experienced were described in theme`s: don`t want to be a burden on others, physical limitations of the illness, dying itself, legacy for family and friends and the world, staying in control over their own life, significance of death for themselves and others. The way patients cope with their <b>concerns</b> is divers. The respondents seem to search for a way of coping that fits their own <b>concerns</b> and situation best. Conclusion It seems that the <b>concerns</b> that terminally ill patients experience are very divers. And many different factors seem to have influence on these <b>concerns.</b> How patients cope with their <b>concerns</b> is individually determined. Recommendations It is recommended to set up a larger qualitative study at the <b>concerns</b> of terminally ill patients.
