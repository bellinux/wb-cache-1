5|$|By this time, on {{both the}} Eastern and Western Front, the {{activities}} of the SS were becoming <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> the Allies, as the concentration and extermination camps were being overrun. Allied troops were filled with disbelief and repugnance at the evidence of Nazi brutality in the camps.|$|E
50|$|As Stewart was not <b>cleared</b> <b>to</b> drive {{yet at the}} end of the 2013 season, {{including}} all official off-season testing, Martin continued driving the No. 14 during off-season testing. Stewart was eventually <b>cleared</b> <b>to</b> race.|$|R

5|$|The modern routing of NY186 was {{originally}} designated {{as part of}} NY10 when {{the first set of}} posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924. In the 1930 renumbering, NY10 was rerouted east of Lake <b>Clear</b> <b>to</b> follow modern NY30 north to the Canadian border. The former routing of NY10 between Lake Clear and Harrietstown was incorporated into NY86, a new route extending from Lake <b>Clear</b> <b>to</b> Jay. NY86 remained on this alignment until March28, 1989, when the NY192 designation was deleted. NY86 was then rerouted to follow the former routing of NY192 northwestward to Paul Smiths. The Lake Clear–Harrietstown roadway, vacated by NY86, was redesignated as NY186.|$|E
5|$|Although the British Army {{refused to}} co-operate with the producers—and Winston Churchill thought the film would ruin wartime morale—Colonel Blimp confounded critics when {{it proved to}} be an artistic and {{commercial}} success. Powell hoped to reunite Kerr and lead actor Roger Livesey in his next film, A Canterbury Tale (1944), but her agent had sold her contract to MGM. According to Powell, his affair with Kerr ended when she made it <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> him that she would accept an offer to go to Hollywood if one were made.|$|E
5|$|An acute {{exacerbation}} of COPD {{is defined}} as increased shortness of breath, increased sputum production, {{a change in the}} color of the sputum from <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> green or yellow, or an increase in cough in someone with COPD. This may present with signs of increased work of breathing such as fast breathing, a fast heart rate, sweating, active use of muscles in the neck, a bluish tinge to the skin, and confusion or combative behavior in very severe exacerbations. Crackles may also be heard over the lungs on examination with a stethoscope.|$|E

25|$|Originally, the FAT ID {{was meant}} to be a bit flag with all bits set except for bit 2 <b>cleared</b> <b>to</b> {{indicate}} an 80 track (vs. 40 track) format, bit 1 <b>cleared</b> <b>to</b> indicate a 9 sector (vs. 8 sector) format, and bit 0 <b>cleared</b> <b>to</b> indicate a single-sided (vs. double-sided) format, but this scheme was not followed by all OEMs and became obsolete with the introduction of hard disks and high-density formats. Also, the various 8-inch formats supported by 86-DOS and MS-DOS do not fit this scheme.|$|R

5|$|Before this {{parliamentary}} decree, the purchaser of a tulip contract—known {{in modern}} finance as a futures contract—was legally obliged {{to buy the}} bulbs. The decree {{changed the nature of}} these contracts, so that if the current market price fell, the purchaser could opt to pay a penalty and forgo receipt of the bulb, rather than pay the full contracted price. This change in law meant that, in modern terminology, the futures contracts had been transformed into options contracts. This proposal began to be debated in the fall of 1636, and if it became <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> investors that the decree was likely to be enacted, prices probably would have risen.|$|E
5|$|By 26 December, strong German defences had stalled Canadian {{forces in}} Ortona and British and New Zealand forces in Orsogna. Although both Ortona and Villa Grande were {{captured}} {{by the end of}} December, general exhaustion among the Allied forces prevented the capture of Orsogna and an advance to Pescara. When harsh winter weather set in, it became <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> the Allied commanders that no further progress would be made and General Alexander called off the offensive.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the many}} books written about him (Holroyd counts 80 by 1939) Shaw's autobiographical output, {{apart from his}} diaries, was {{relatively}} slight. He gave interviews to newspapers—"GBS Confesses", to The Daily Mail in 1904 is an example—and provided sketches to would-be biographers whose work was rejected by Shaw and never published. In 1939 Shaw drew on these materials to produce Shaw Gives Himself Away, a miscellany which, a year before his death, he revised and republished as Sixteen Self Sketches (there were seventeen). He made it <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> his publishers that this slim book was in no sense a full autobiography.|$|E

5|$|Early in his reign, {{there were}} plans {{regarding}} {{a marriage of}} Władysław and Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia, Princess Palatine (daughter of Frederick V, Elector Palatine). This was however unpopular, both with Catholic nobles and the Catholic Church, and when it became <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> Władysław that this would not convince the Swedes to elect him to their throne, this plan, with quiet support from Władysław himself, was dropped.|$|E
5|$|Her {{position}} {{changed the}} following month. She {{had had a}} series of rows with Bamber. He seemed to want to end the relationship, and they had argued about his involvement in the murders. She told him he was a psychopath and at one point tried to smother him with a pillow. During one argument on 4 September, another woman telephoned Bamber in her presence, and it became <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> Mugford that he had been seeing that woman too. Mugford smashed a mirror, slapped Bamber and he twisted her arm up her back. Three days later she went to the police and changed her statement.|$|E
5|$|Hibiki is the 18-year-old {{protagonist of}} the series. He is granted {{the ability to}} summon demons from Nicaea after {{experiencing}} a train accident {{on his way home}} from taking mock exams. With this newfound power he finds himself intertwined in a battle of survival against the Septentriones who seek to destroy the world. Kamiya did not express any opinions on Hibiki's character. However he was very <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> point out that despite the series being called Devil Survivor 2, it is not a sequel to a previous series but rather an independent story all its own.|$|E

5|$|In 1897, the French Academy of Sciences made {{understanding}} bicycle dynamics {{the goal}} of its Prix Fourneyron competition. Thus, {{by the end of}} the 19th century, , Emmanuel Carvallo, and Francis Whipple had showed with rigid-body dynamics that some safety bicycles could actually balance themselves if moving at the right speed. Bourlet won the Prix Fourneyron, and Whipple won the Cambridge University Smith Prize. It is not <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> whom should go the credit for tilting the steering axis from the vertical which helps make this possible.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, when Bauer {{again was}} asked to {{illustrate}} the book, he made it <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> the publisher {{that he wanted to}} retain his pictures along with the copyrights after publication. The publishing house had kept the original illustrations for the previous editions and considered them their property. Bauer was backed up in his request by other artists facing the same problem. The publishers did not budge from their position and without Bauer's illustrations, book sales dropped.|$|E
5|$|It is not <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> what extent, if any, the Hell Fire Club {{made use}} of the building. The author Michael Fewer has {{suggested}} that the remoteness of Mount Pelier's location is why there are almost no verifiable accounts of the activities that went on there. However, numerous (and very doubtful) stories surrounding the building have become part of local folklore, some of which have spread to a wider audience through publication in the nineteenth century in books such as Robert Chambers' Book of Days (1864) and in The Gentleman's Magazine (1731–1922).|$|E
