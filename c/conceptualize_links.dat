40|$|This article {{studies the}} resurrection of the Kul-Sharif Mosque in the Kazan Kremlin {{in the context of the}} {{political}} transformations that Russia and the Republic of Tatarstan went through in the 1990 s. The original structure was destroyed in 1552 when Ivan the Terrible conquered the capital of then Kazan Khanate. In 1990 the Republic of Tatarstan declared its sovereign status. The mosque was cited as a symbol of the heroic resistance to the Russian invaders, restoration of the Tatarstani statehood and cultural revival of the Tatar nation. The mosque became an essential part of the new image of Kazan, the capital city of Tatarstan.

Contrary to previous accounts, which mostly concentrated on understanding democratic as accessible art or on analyzing the role of art in democratic society. suggest that a democratic aesthetics can be properly understood by interpreting specific formal features of artworks as metaphors for particular key elements of democracy as it is framed in important strands of contemporary democratic theory. The project argues, among other things, that {{a certain kind of}} loose collage composition stands in a metaphorical relationship with the structure of a pluralist democratic polity. Systematically developed, this account helps better to understand the democratic quality of individual artworks, and also makes plausible how aesthetics can contribute to the discourse of democratic theory.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} those factors that influence the adoption of internet banking services in Tunisia. A theoretical model is provided that <b>conceptualizes</b> and <b>links</b> different factors influencing the adoption of internet banking. A total of 253 respondents in Tunisia were sampled for responding: 95 were internet bank users, 158 were internet bank non users. Factor analyses and regression technique are employed to study the relationship. The results of the model tested clearly that use of internet banking in Tunisia is influenced most strongly by convenience, risk, security and prior internet knowledge. Only information on online banking did not affect intention to use internet banking service in Tunisia. The results also propose that demographic factors impact significantly internet banking behaviour, specifically, occupation and instruction. Finally, this paper suggests that an understanding the factors affecting intention to use internet banking is very important to the practitioners who plan and promote new forms of banking in the current competitive market...|$|R

The argument begins with the overview of the approaches of the late/post-Soviet transition, which are critically assessed {{on the basis of their}} anchoring in the modernization paradigm. The thesis then turns to the formulation of the alternative theoretical explanation based on the sound theoretical observations from the field of historical sociology. The theoretical debate leads to the formulation of the model involving three causal mechanisms connecting the macro and micro levels. Empirically, the thesis argues that Georgian violent mobilization resulted from the processes that were determined by the functioning and decline of the Soviet developmentalist state. While accepting the dynamics of ethnopolitical mobilization it seeks to answer the question which socio-economic processes breed these mobilizations...|$|R

40|$|The {{link between}} {{migration}} and HIV/AIDS is well documented. Theoretical work {{to understand the}} behavioral mechanisms underlying migrants’ HIV risk behaviors is limited. In most studies migration {{is viewed as a}} virus carrier and population mixer. In this paper I present a framework <b>conceptualizing</b> the <b>link</b> between temporary migration and migrants’ heightened HIV risk behaviors. Data from a large and population-based survey conducted in 2003 in southwestern China are used to empirically test the proposed framework. Results suggest that temporary migrants are more likely to use drugs than nonmigrants; they {{are also more likely to}} have had unprotected casual sex and a greater number of casual-sex partners than comparable nonmigrants. Postmigration economic marginalization, social isolation, and lax social control contribute to migrants’ elevated risk behaviors, so do migration selectivity and social influences from family and peers. Temporary migrants are at risk of HIV; intervention needs to target migrants’ postmigration milieus and their social network of family and peers. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{environmental}} {{and sustainable development}} policy issues, and in infrastructural megaprojects and issues of innovative medical technologies as well, public authorities face emergent complexity, high value diversity, difficult-to-structure problems, high decision stakes, high uncertainty, and thus risk. In practice, it is believed, this often leads to crises, controversies, deadlocks, and policy fiascoes. Decision-makers are said to face a crisis in coping with uncertainty. Both the cognitive structure of uncertainty and the political structure of risk decisions have been studied. So far, these scientific literatures exist side by side, with few apparent efforts at theoretically conceptualizing and empirically testing the links between the two. Therefore, this exploratory and conceptual paper takes up the challenge: How should we conceptualize the cognitive structure of uncertainty? How should we conceptualize the political structure of risk? How can we <b>conceptualize</b> the <b>link(s)</b> between the two? Is there any empirical support for a conceptualization that bridges the analytical and political aspects of risk? What are the implications for guidelines for risk analysis and assessment...|$|R

Furthermore, it evaluates justice dimensions (especially interactional justice) and their impact on perceptions of complaint management...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} {{extensive}} {{literature on the}} positive effects of microfinance in developing countries with regards to financial inclusion of the poor, economic growth and poverty reduction. This paper seeks to take these facts one step further, arguing that microfinance paves the way for the political empowerment of the poor because it creates social capital in developing economies. I make the case that a growth in social capital due to financial inclusion helps impoverished people realize their political potential by instilling a need for political awareness and increased participation in the political process. An analysis of the current literature concerning the various social effects of microfinance is presented with a focus on social capital growth and feelings of empowerment. Raw data collected from microfinance institutions in two Central Asian countries provide an appropriate case to evaluate the political effects of microfinance because of the growing microfinance industry in the region. Additionally, relevant qualitative data exists with regards to this topic in the region that helps to <b>conceptualize</b> the <b>link</b> between social capital, self-efficacy and political empowerment...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this M. A. thesis study {{is to examine the}} way in which first {{generation}} Spanish-speaking immigrants <b>conceptualize</b> the <b>link</b> between culture, language, and identity, and how they reject third space identity when describing their experiences with acquiring and speaking English and Spanish in the U. S. By conducting a thematic analysis of field notes from adult ESL classrooms and transcribed interviews with ESL students and coordinators, I reveal the tension between the desire to perform a U. S. American identity and the reluctance to embrace or internalize that identity. I propose that first generation immigrants who are actively assimilating talk about culture as mentality, and specifically, reference U. S. mentalities as contradictory to their own. I also posit that individuals make sense of this tension by referring to a split between enacting and claiming an identity, specifically by distinguishing between residing and belonging and public and private languages. Ultimately, immigrants who choose to reject third space identity still face a lived reality in which their foreign status is highlighted in all contexts...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the late}} 1990 s, {{there has been}} {{increasing}} consensus that the global obesity epidemic is driven by environmental factors. Obesity is thus {{a good example of}} where human interaction with the environment can make and unmake health in many societies. In this chapter we examine frameworks designed to <b>conceptualize</b> the <b>links</b> between the environment and obesity. We focus on two frameworks of obesogenesis: that of the ‘obesogenic environment’, which was developed in the Asia-Pacific region, and the ‘obesity system’, which was developed in the UK. We describe the contexts in which these two frameworks were developed, and show how both synthesize environmental, biological and social factors. The frameworks reviewed suggest that obesity could be considered an ecobiosocial phenomenon. We then review anthropological understandings of human-environment interactions, and highlight that lived experience is not comprised of separate factors, but rather dynamic and interdependent processes. Elements of lived experience, such as social relations and historical change over time, are not fully captured by these two frameworks of obesity. Ecobiosocial frameworks informed by anthropological enquiry may be useful for describing obesity in future...|$|R
40|$|Employees’ {{links to}} {{organizations}} and coworkers represent {{an important factor}} related to many work-related constructs in the Industrial-Organizational (I-O) Psychology literature. Often, I-O researchers <b>conceptualize</b> these employee <b>links</b> through either the number of workplace links or an employee’s perceived social support. However, these conceptualizations are potentially limited. Research into Social Network Analysis has investigated different quality dimensions in links (e. g., link strength and valence) which can significantly influence outcomes in social, workplace, and general well-being. Thus, the present proposed thesis project seeks to explore whether incorporating these quality dimensions of link strength and link valence adds any incremental utility {{to our understanding of}} workplace constructs...|$|R

The results also highlight increasing online risk acceptance by customers and the growing importance of deep levels of customer support for online services. Key gender differences in attitudes to Internet banking are highlighted. This study suggests that organizations will improve their management of customer attitudes to new Internet service applications by understanding the need to proactively address customer fears and misconceptions about the technologies involved. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Aim. The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a model, the ‘Effect of the Professional Ego’, which {{provides}} a psychodynamically informed analytical framework for examining professional practice in arenas where issues of inequalities need to be addressed. Background. There is a great deal of literature on the psychosocial aspects of inequalities in health care provision. However, the impact of intrapsychic and professional cultural elements has not been explored in this context. Moreover, the body of work which does explore these elements in relation to health care workers does not address how they might impact on health inequalities. Discussion. Drawing on empirical work, we discuss ways in which intrapsychic and professional cultural elements feed into the dynamic between clients and health care professionals in a way which can subvert espoused, positive client health outcomes. Based on this discussion, we propose the Effect of the Professional Ego model, which identifies two main aspects of the professional ego – the grandiose self and selfpreservation – and how they influence the professional/client dynamic. Conclusion. Systematic self-reflection on the part of professionals would be a valuable contribution to the development of professional practice. This applies particularly to <b>conceptualizing</b> the <b>links</b> between the actions of service providers and the adverse health of client...|$|R

This increase in cosmetic surgery prevalence is paralleled by a surge in reality cosmetic makeover television programming, such as Extreme Makeover and Dr. 90210. No research to date has assessed the potential relationships between reality media viewership and body image, eating pathology, or cosmetic surgery attitudes. The tripartite model of core influence (Thompson et al., 1999) {{is presented as a}} theoretical framework for <b>conceptualizing</b> the <b>link</b> between media influences, internalization, body image dissatisfaction, and outcomes such as eating disorder symptomatology and cosmetic surgery attitudes. The current study examines the relationships between reality cosmetic makeover viewership, cosmetic surgery attitudes, body image, and eating disorder symptomatology in a sample of 2057 college females. Viewership of reality cosmetic surgery shows was significantly related to more favorable cosmetic surgery attitudes, perceived pressure to have cosmetic surgery, past attainment of a cosmetic procedure, overall body dissatisfaction, thin ideal internalization, eating disorder symptomatology, and a decreased fear of surgery. Although the current study is correlational, it provides a framework for future hypothesis testing and elucidates the link between contemporary media influences, body dissatisfaction, eating disturbance, and cosmetic surgery attitudes and behaviors...|$|R
40|$|Higher {{education}} is a critical pathway for social mobility in American society, yet social class disparities in college outcomes {{raise questions about the}} promise of this opportunity. Existing research fails to explain what actually happens in college to promote or hinder student success and social mobility. Drawing upon more than 200 in-depth interviews and 800 hours of participant observation at an urban, public comprehensive university, this dissertation research investigates the role of social class in undergraduate academic achievement during {{the first two years of}} college. Findings reveal social class differences in undergraduate engagement, which leads to achievement, and that the choice of academic major mediates student engagement. To further explore the process of undergraduate major selection, this study considers the ways students acquire and utilize sources of advice and information and ultimately select majors. It finds that students from different social class backgrounds choose their academic majors in consequentially different ways, which ultimately reinforce their middle-class advantages and first-generation disadvantages. This study contributes to and advances the higher education and sociology literatures by <b>conceptualizing</b> the <b>link</b> between major choice, academic engagement, and social class gaps in undergraduate achievement. Furthermore, this research identifies the major choice process as a critical point of stratification within higher education and an area requiring additional research. ...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [59]- 60) The {{purpose of}} this study was to investigate to what extent sports activity among high-school students reinforces the expected value system of sports membership and how the high-school athletes themselves deal with moral conflict inherent in choosing between good sportsmanship or winning-at-all-costs. Three questions were asked to guide the analysis: (1) To what extent does winning-at-all-costs override norms of good sportsmanship and virtuous behavior? (2) How do the boys explain or justify the choice they made? and (3) To what extent does their choice influence other behavior? Three specific methods were used to answer the above stated research questions: a questionnaire, three story problems, and interviews. All three methods elicited responses from the 1995 - 96 varsity football team at a large, suburban high school. It was found that the athletes themselves are chief actors in constructing the meaning of sportsmanship and that they viewed their own participation as being closer to the meaning of sport than to athletics. It was also found that most of the football players participated in football for intrinsic rather than extrinsic reasons. Finally, it was found that the players <b>conceptualized</b> strong <b>link</b> between sportsmanship and being part of a team. M. S. Ed. (Master of Education...|$|R
40|$|As society {{strives to}} {{transition}} towards more sustainable development pathways, {{it is important}} to properly <b>conceptualize</b> the <b>link</b> between biodiversity (i. e. genes, traits, species and other dimensions) and human well-being (HWB; i. e. health, wealth, security and other dimensions). Here, we explore how published conceptual frameworks consider {{the extent to which the}} biodiversity–HWB links are being integrated into public discourse and scientific research and the implications of our findings for sustainable development. We find that our understanding has gradually evolved from seeing the value of biodiversity as an external commodity that may influence HWB to biodiversity as fundamental to HWB. Analysis of the literature trends indicates increasing engagement with the terms biodiversity, HWB and sustainable development in the public, science and policy spheres, but largely as independent rather than linked terms. We suggest that a consensus framework for sustainable development should include biodiversity explicitly as a suite of internal variables that both influence and are influenced by HWB. Doing so will enhance clarity and help shape coherent research and policy priorities. We further suggest that the absence of this link in development can inadvertently lead to a ratcheting down of biodiversity by otherwise well-meaning policies. Such biotic impoverishment could lock HWB at minimum levels or lead to its decline and halt or reverse progress in achieving sustainable development. © 2016 The Authors...|$|R
40|$|This paper's {{philosophical}} {{ideas are}} developed from a General Nursing Council for England and Wales Trust-funded study to explore nursing knowledge and wisdom and {{ways in which}} these can be translated into clinical practice and fostered in junior nurses. Participants using Carper's (1978) ways of knowing as a framework experienced difficulty <b>conceptualizing</b> a <b>link</b> between the empirics and ethics of nursing. The philosophical problem is how to understand praxis as a moral entity with intrinsic value when so much of value seems to be technical and extrinsic depending on desired ends. Using the Aristotelian terms poesis and praxis can articulate the concerns that the participants as well as Carper (1978) and Dreyfus (in Flyvbjerg, 1991) among others share that certain actions or ways of knowing important for nursing are being devalued and deformed by the importance placed on quantitative data and measurable outcomes. The sense of praxis is a moralized one and most of what nurses do is plausibly on any account of normative ethics a morally good thing; the articulation {{of the idea of}} praxis can go some way in showing how it {{is a part of the}} discipline of nursing. Nursing's acts as poesis can be a part of how practitioners come to have praxis as phronesis or practical wisdom. So to be a wise nurse, one needs be a wise person...|$|R
40|$|Research {{pertaining}} to Filipino American health issues is growing but most remain delimited to children, college students, and older adults. The {{purpose of this}} study was two-fold. The first was to define the health beliefs of four Filipino American women who were in midlife through in-depth one-on-one interviews regarding cardiovascular diseases and in utilizing health care to prevent, diagnose, or treat those diseases. The second purpose was to <b>conceptualize</b> potential <b>links</b> between the health beliefs of those Filipino American women and their attitudes or choices about health care utilization. Conclusively, the health beliefs of the four midlife Filipino-American women in this study were firmly established in their self-efficacy in recognizing their risks of cardiovascular disease and in making the best choices to decrease their risk of developing one. In contrast to the assumptions of this study, I found that these women a) were very aware of the resources available to them when they had health issues and b) their health beliefs regarding cardiovascular diseases did not hinder utilization of the health care services to which they had access. In fact, they were more receptive to utilizing health care resources to garner a medical perspective as long as they gained a clearer understanding of the health issue and that the treatment options were as natural as possible...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Control {{programs}} for Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs) typically focus on increasing awareness of {{risks associated with}} different forms of sexual contact, and pay little attention to how or why people may link RTIs to other features of their physical or social environments. This paper describes how women in a peri-urban pueblo joven located in the coastal desert surrounding Lima, Peru <b>conceptualize</b> the <b>links</b> between RTIs, sexual behaviour, personal hygiene, and the adverse {{environment in which they}} live. Methods We combined qualitative interviews and a participatory voting exercise to examine social and physical environmental influences on RTIs and gynaecologic symptom interpretation. Results Knowledge of RTIs in general was limited, although knowledge of AIDS was higher. Perceived causes of RTIs fell into three categories: sexual contact with infected persons, personal hygiene and exposure to the contaminated physical environment, with AIDS clearly related to sexual contact. The adverse environment is thought to be a major contributor to vaginal discharge, "inflamed ovaries" and urinary tract infection. The more remote parts of this periurban squatter settlement, characterized by blowing sand and dust and limited access to clean water, are thought to exhibit higher rates of RTIs {{as a direct result of}} the adverse environment found there. Stigma associated with RTIs often keeps women from seeking care or obtaining information about gynaecologic symptoms, and favours explanations that avoid mention of sexual practices. Conclusion The discrepancy between demonstrated disease risk factors and personal explanations influenced by local environmental conditions and RTI-related stigma poses a challenge for prevention programs. Effective interventions need to take local understandings of RTIs into account as they engage in dialogue with communities about prevention and treatment of RTIs. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background Individuals {{with mental}} illness often {{experience}} stigmatization and encounter stereotypes such as being dangerous or unpredictable. To further improve measures against psychiatric stigma, it is of importance to understand its components. In this study, we attend to the step of separation between “us” and “them” in the stigma process as <b>conceptualized</b> by <b>Link</b> and Phelan. In using the belief in continuity of mental illness symptoms {{as a proxy for}} separation, we explore its associations with stereotypes, emotional responses and desire for social distance in the stigma process. Methods Analyses are based on a representative survey in Germany. Vignettes with symptoms suggestive of schizophrenia (n = 1, 338) or depression (n = 1, 316) were presented to the respondents, followed by questions on continuum belief, stereotypes, emotional reactions and desire for social distance. To examine the relationship between these items, path models were computed. Results Respondents who endorsed the continuum belief tended to show greater prosocial reactions (schizophrenia: 0. 07; p < 0. 001, depression: 0. 09; p < 0. 001) and less desire for social distance (schizophrenia: − 0. 13; p < 0. 001, depression: − 0. 14; p < 0. 001) toward a person {{with mental illness}}. In both cases, agreement with the stereotypes of unpredictability and dangerousness was positively associated with feelings of anger and fear as well as desire for social distance. There were no statistically significant relations between stereotypes and continuum beliefs. Discussion Assumptions regarding continuum beliefs in the stigma process were only partially confirmed. However, there were associations of continuum beliefs with less stigmatizing attitudes toward persons affected by either schizophrenia or depression. Including information on continuity of symptoms, and thus oppose perceived separation, could prove helpful in future anti-stigma campaigns...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThere {{has been}} a growing {{interest}} {{in the field of}} “arts management” and the extensive literature has helped to develop models for managing arts organizations. These models may be summarized in what is called the model of “Arts Administration”. Indeed scholars have basically investigated established “art worlds”, considering that art referred to a “given field”, and have then appointed the manager to administer it. In this paper we focus on emerging “art worlds” since they have been disregarded by the traditional literature on arts management. As recent works demonstrate it, when art can hardly be considered as a “given field”, the role of the manager cannot be reduced to traditional “administration”. Drawing on these premises, we suggest a design-based model to <b>conceptualize</b> the deep <b>links</b> between art and management in emerging “art worlds”. To validate it, we investigate an in-depth and longitudinal single case study of a firm operating in the field of artistic gardening. A new agenda for the managers of art-based firms comes out from the case study. It suggests rethinking the collaboration between artist and manager no longer as “cohabitation” but also as “co-generation”...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} forms part of {{a larger}} interdisciplinary research project on the termination of pregnancies. The focus of this part of the project is on the ethical issues related to termination of pregnancies. The practice of the professional nurse is confronted with ethical dilemmas and disputes. Whether the nurse chooses to participate in the termination of pregnancies or not, the core function of the nurse is that of counseling and ethical decisionmaking. Effective counseling requires empathy, respect for human rights and unconditional acceptance of a person. Making ethical decisions implies making critical decisions. It is self-evident, therefore, that such decisions should be based on sound arguments and logical reasoning. It is of vital importance that ethical decisions can be justified on rational ground. Decision-making is a critical thinking approach process for choosing the best action to meet a desired goal. The research question that is relevant for this paper is: Are nurses thinking critically about ethical issues like the termination of pregnancies? To answer the research question a qualitative, exploratory, descriptive design was used (Mouton, 1996 : 103 - 169). Registered nurses were selected purposively (Creswell, 1994 : 15). 1200 registered nurses completed the open-ended questionnaires. Focus group interviews were conducted with 22 registered nurses from a public hospital for women and child health services. Data analysis, using secondary data from open-ended questionnaires and transcribed focus group interviews, were based on the approach of Morse and Field (1994 : 25 - 34) and Strauss and Corbin (1990). The themes and categories from open coding were compared, <b>conceptualized</b> and <b>linked</b> with theories on critical thinking (Paul, 1994; Watson & Glaser, 1991 and the American Philosophical Association, 1990). The measures of Lincoln and Guba (1985) and Morse (1994) related to secondary data analysis were employed to ensure trustworthiness. Based on these findings the researcher concluded that nurses are not thinking critically when making ethical decisions concerning the termination of pregnancies. Recommendations are made as a possible solution for this problem...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{addresses}} the question how a low-cost carrier (LCC) {{embedded in a}} coordinated market economy is succeeding in a highly competitive industry with a strong cost focus. Design/methodology/approach – This paper reports {{the results of a}} case study of a LCC (Norwegian Air Shuttle). The case study draws on both organizational and institutional theory as to how the international business environment and the national institutional framework continuously impact on its strategies. Findings – It is found that home-country high wage levels and strong labour regulation have been overcome by developing firm-specific capabilities based on active employee involvement which aligns with the tradition of the national system of industrial relations. Research limitations/implications – The present case study provides an input for further research on how actors deal with conflicting pressures. It supports the varieties of capitalism (VOC) argument that national institutional arrangements influence firms and actors’ strategies and practices, but it also supports the call within institutional theories for a more malleable <b>conceptualizing</b> of the <b>link</b> between actors and institutions than is the case in the VOC models. Originality/value – The paper provides an account of a successful case in a highly competitive international business despite disadvantages linked with home-country institutions...|$|R
40|$|Drawing on {{intergroup}} contact {{theory and}} intergroup threat theory, this chapter outlines {{the interplay of}} contact and threat in intergroup relations over time and their interactive effects on prejudice. We propose the Temporally Integrated Model of Intergroup Contact and Threat (TIMICAT), which holds that both (positive or negative, direct or indirect) contact and (different types of) threat can vary over time and in relation to one another. The effects of contact and threat on prejudice may be cumulative and additive and this trajectory can be disrupted by salient changes in any temporal element. TIMICAT systematically structures the intergroup context {{in terms of the}} temporal frame for contact and threats (none, past, continuous, discrete, multiple, future). We then provide initial empirical evidence for TIMICAT, using data from majority and minority group perspectives, from different countries. Moreover, a two-year longitudinal study questions the causal direction proposed by intergroup threat theory. Finally, a quasi-experimental study found that threat cannot only be a mediator in the contact-prejudice relationship, but that threat and contact can operate in parallel as independent influences on prejudice. In conclusion, we propose the TIMICAT framework as a novel way to <b>conceptualize</b> the contact-threat-prejudice <b>links</b> and look forward to seeing more research that examines these variables in a temporal and interactive framework...|$|R
