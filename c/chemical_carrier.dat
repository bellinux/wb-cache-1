50|$|One of {{the most}} common forms of {{pesticide}} application, especially in conventional agriculture, is the use of mechanical sprayers. Hydraulic sprayers consists of a tank, a pump, a lance (for single nozzles) or boom, and a nozzle (or multiple nozzles). Sprayers convert a pesticide formulation, often containing a mixture of water (or another liquid <b>chemical</b> <b>carrier,</b> such as fertilizer) and chemical, into droplets, which can be large rain-type drops or tiny almost-invisible particles. This conversion is accomplished by forcing the spray mixture through a spray nozzle under pressure. The size of droplets can be altered through the use of different nozzle sizes, or by altering the pressure under which it is forced, or a combination of both. Large droplets have the advantage of being less susceptible to spray drift, but require more water per unit of land covered. Due to static electricity, small droplets are able to maximize contact with a target organism, but very still wind conditions are required.|$|E

30|$|Methanol {{has been}} {{considered}} as an important raw material in the synthesis of various chemicals. Dehydrogenation of methanol was expected as a promising process to synthesize formaldehyde and methyl formate [1]. Formaldehyde is an industrial chemical that is widely used to manufacture numerous household products [2]. Formaldehyde and methyl formate are produced in large quantity by the coal chemical industry and natural gas chemical industry [3], {{both of them are}} important organic chemical materials usually used as the raw material of medicines [4]. Methanol is also considered as a candidate for the <b>chemical</b> <b>carrier</b> to transport hydrogen [5]. Copper-based catalysts appeared to be active towards the dehydrogenation of methanol. The activity and selectivity of catalyst were strongly influenced by both reaction conditions and surface structure. On reduced copper surface, CH 3 O species decomposed near 370  K to form formaldehyde and methyl formate [6]. Over the past two decades, there has been considerable interest in the adsorption and decomposition mechanism of methanol over solid surfaces such as Cu, Pt, Ni, TiO 2 and other oxides [7, 8, 9, 10, 11].|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies from}} this {{laboratory}} {{have demonstrated that}} Mycobacterium leprae, an obligate intracellular bacterial parasite, enters human mononuclear phagocytes via complement receptors on these host cells and bacterium-bound C 3. The present study investigates the role of M. leprae surface molecules in C 3 fixation and phagocytosis. By enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, C 3 binds selectively to phenolic glycolipid- 1 (PGL- 1), a major surface molecule of the leprosy bacillus. C 3 fixation to PGL- 1 is serum concentration dependent and is abolished in heat-inactivated serum or serum containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. C 3 fixation is also abolished in serum containing ethyleneglycol-bis (beta-aminoethyl ether) N,N,N'-tetraacetic acid and MgCl 2 indicating that isolated PGL- 1 fixes C 3 via the classical complement pathway. The capacity of PGL- 1 to fix C 3 is dependent upon its terminal trisaccharide since sequential removal of monosaccharide units of the trisaccharide results in a stepwise reduction in C 3 fixation. Deacylation of PGL- 1 also abolishes C 3 fixation. C 3 fixes to the trisaccharide of PGL- 1 that is chemically linked to bovine serum albumin via the <b>chemical</b> <b>carrier,</b> 8 - methoxycarbonyloctanol. PGL- 1 mediates C 3 fixation to polystyrene microspheres, and PGL- 1 and C 3 together mediate ingestion of polystyrene microspheres by human monocytes, wherein these inert test particles reside in membrane-bound phagosomes. Thus, complement receptors on mononuclear phagocytes, complement component C 3, and PGL- 1 comprise a three-component receptor-ligand-acceptor molecule system for mediating phagocytosis of M. leprae...|$|E
30|$|The driver process {{delivering}} {{energy and}} enabling {{the formation of}} an activated carrier in the first step of Figure 1 may be physical (for instance photochemical and not being subject to microscopic reversibility as proposed in an analysis of autocatalytic models on the emergence of homochirality[21]) or chemical. However, its actual nature does not matter. The condition that the proto-metabolisms must work irreversibly (as a one-way flux of reactants) for coupling self-organization with an entropy producing process implies that this driver process is capable of bringing the system into an excited state with a free energy exceeding the level of the transition state of the reaction reverting the energy carrier into its precursors. As a result, this short-lived activated state either reverts back to the reactants or proceeds downhill in the forward direction until a free energy well is reached yielding a <b>chemical</b> <b>carrier</b> conserving {{a significant part of the}} free energy of the source. Irreversibility in the proto-metabolic process thus emerges from the kinetic barrier of a reverse reaction. This discussion helps in identifying processes enabling the formation of the energy carriers. Photochemical processes able to deliver the corresponding amount of energy (ca. 150 kJ mol– 1) correspond to wavelength of ca. 0.8 μm meaning that light in the visible spectrum is needed. Few other physical processes are capable of driving such systems in a spontaneous way. Using the black body emission as a typical example of irreversible transformation of thermal energy, heating a solid to 3600 K enables the emission of electromagnetic radiations with a maximum at the wavelength of 0.8 μm. This can be a measurement of the temperature needed for thermal energy to generate activated chemical intermediates, though the system needs a quenching step to preserve the corresponding species from evolving back to equilibrium. The only obvious processes compatible with the effect of heat are lightning, as mimicked in the Miller experiment[22], and impact-shock syntheses[23]. These processes are capable of heating locally and transiently the atmosphere at temperatures exceeding several thousand of K needed to generate radicals and ions that have enough time to recombine after cooling within a fraction of second at the lower temperature of the high atmosphere. By contrast, finding means by which geothermal energy could directly play a similar role is more problematic.|$|E
