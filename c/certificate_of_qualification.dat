5|$|In 2004, Savenko {{stated that}} the passed law on the state expert {{activity}} {{and the introduction of}} the profession of forensic expert psychiatrist actually destroyed adversary-based examinations and that the Serbsky Center turned into the complete monopolist of forensic examination, which it had never been under Soviet rule. Formerly, the court could include any psychiatrist in a commission of experts, but now the court only chooses an expert institution. The expert has the right to participate only in commissions that he is included in by the head of his expert institution, and can receive the <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>qualification</b> as an expert only after having worked in a state expert institution for three years. The Director of the Serbsky Center Dmitrieva was, at the same time, the head of the forensic psychiatry department which is {{the only one in the}} country and is located in her Center. No one had ever had such a monopoly.|$|E
