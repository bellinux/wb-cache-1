The first occupants of the siding were five dormitory coaches and a <b>canteen</b> <b>van,</b> for which an ex Highland Railway 4-4-0 LMS no 14382, Loch Moy, supplied steam heat, though minus its internal machinery. This siding expanded into a large yard of ten parallel roads, ultimately 6Â¼ miles long, curved round to {{the shore of the}} loch.|$|E

During and after World War II, many specialist variations such as mobile <b>canteens,</b> ice cream <b>vans</b> and even fire pumps were built on the E83W chassis.|$|R
