40|$|A recent {{trend in}} bridge {{construction}} {{has been the}} optimization of the <b>cost-to-performance</b> <b>ratio.</b> The {{most effective way to}} optimize the <b>cost-to-performance</b> <b>ratio</b> is to maximize the efficiency of the superstructure. Currently, many bridge engineers and designers favor two- or three- girder plate superstructures, due to their cost advantages. However, research on the performance enhancements of the I-type girder in two- or three- girder plate bridges is lacking. One of the most important performance improvement technologies for the I-type girder is the “preflex” method. In the preflex method, the specimen is inverted during the construction process to apply prestressed cambering to the specimen by using self-weight. However, a problem with the preflex construction method is difficulty with inverting the girder/plate system during the concrete curing process. Therefore, a new inverting system called Turn-Over (TO) wheel was proposed. Using TO wheels, wider variations to the I-type girder design can be achieved. Using this TO construction method, various cross sectional designs of girder plate systems can be considered due to its easiness in inverting the girder/plate system. In this study, the location of concrete confinement sections between the steel I-beams and concrete plates was varied in an I-girder cross-sectional design. Design parameters included effective height, flange thickness, flange width, confining concrete section width, etc. From this study, the optimum cross-sectional design of the I-girder/concrete plate system was achieved. Then, a single 20 m TO girder/plate system and two 20 m TO girder bridges were constructed and tested to evaluate their performance. From the test, failure behavior, load carrying capacity, crack pattern, etc., are obtained. The results are discussed in detail in this paper...|$|E

Compared to high-Tc conductors such as YBa 2 Cu 3 Ox and Bi 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 Ox on the other hand, it is a relatively simple compound and therefore easier to synthesise.

The devices exhibit significant short-circuit current density (J(sc)), open-circuit voltage (V-oc) and power conversion efficiency (PCE). The best power conversion efficiency of 3. 9 % with J(sc) 14. 8 mA cm(- 2), V-oc, of 0. 82 V and fill factor of 32 % was obtained with Z@C-dots as acceptor at active layer concentration of 40 mg ml(- 1) and weight ratio of 1 : 1. In addition, the phase analysis of the active-layer interface demonstrates the better compatibility of the organic:organic phase (i. e. polymer:C-dots with a device PCE of 2. 8 %) as compared to the organic:inorganic phase (i. e. polymer:ZnO with a device PCE of 1. 41 %). Moreover, the best performance of the organic:hybrid phase (i. e. polymer:Z@C-dots with a device PCE of 3. 9 %) is due to the exploitation of properties of both organic and inorganic components on the same platform. C-dots as an acceptor give an overall power conversion efficiency of 2. 8 %, whereas Z@G resulted in an efficiency of 3. 1 %. A fullerene-based device gives an efficiency of 4. 2 % (just 0. 3 % more in comparison to Z@C-dots), but the difference in material cost is more than 50 times, which thus results in a significant improvement in the <b>cost-to-performance</b> <b>ratio</b> of a Z@C-dots-based device than a device using fullerene as an acceptor. Therefore, the developed carbonaceous nanomaterials act as potential acceptors in non-fullerene-based polymer solar cells for possible applications...|$|E

The cryogenic distribution scheme {{for each of the}} eight sectors, individually served by a refrigeration plant, is based on a separate Cryogenic Distribution Line (QRL) feeding helium at different temperatures and pressures to the elementary cooling loops. The QRL comprises two supply headers and three return headers including a sub-atmospheric one. Low heat inleak to all temperature levels is essential for the overall LHC cryogenic performance.

40|$|Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) are {{electronic}} devices that return a craft 2 ̆ 019 s angular velocities and translational accelerations. They {{are used in}} many industries, such as underwater and aviation robotics. There is a large variation in IMU cost, and when considering the dependability of different IMUs, generally their manufacturers provide completely different metrics to quantify their performance. Because of this, {{it is very difficult}} to decide which sensor has a more reasonable <b>cost-to-performance</b> <b>ratio</b> for any particular project. To solve this dilemma, research and experimentation at IOT began. First a specialized apparatus was created to mount all IMUs to the same rigid body. MATLAB 4 applications were then written to simultaneously record data from all of the IMUs, while they were experiencing motion. Unfortunately a series of issues continued to occur, and after many trials, it was decided that a solution other than these MATLAB applications had to be designed. The Data Logger application is data acquisition software written in Java and is designed to be as lightweight and robust as possible. This application was created as a solution to the issues experienced with the formerly mentioned MATLAB applications. Once Data Logger was finished, experimentation was much more simple and the testing could begin again. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|Temperature {{measurement}} is a {{key issue}} in the LHC, as {{it will be used}} to regulate the cooling of the superconducting magnets. The compromise between available cooling power and the coil superconducting characteristics leads to a restricted temperature control band, around 1. 9 K. An absolute accuracy DeltaT < 10 mK below 2. 2 K, and DeltaT < 5 K above 25 K, is necessary. For resistive thermometers covering the full temperature range, and having a negative dR/dT sensitivity, this is typically equivalent to a relative accuracy DeltaR/R of 3 10 **- 3 over 3 resistance decades. Also, to limit the thermometer's self-heating, the sensing current must be limited to few muA. Furthermore, the radiation levels next to the accelerator are expected to degrade significantly the performance of conventional analogue electronics. As these stringent requirements are not met by commercial conditioners, three different architectures have been developed at CERN. The first compresses the input dynamic range using a logarithmic transfer function; the second partitions the input range into three linear regions; the third converts resistance linearly into the frequency of a square wave. They fulfil the above specifications and provide industrial robustness in terms of thermal drift, galvanic protection, and compact packaging, while optimising <b>cost-to-performance</b> <b>ratio.</b> This paper describes the principles of their design, compares their characteristics and shows results of field tests.

30|$|Recent {{advances}} in sensor technology have {{given rise to}} a new class of miniaturized devices characterized by advanced signal processing methods, high performance, multi-fusion techniques, and high-speed electronic circuits. The trends toward ICT of the new wave of computing, coupled with the evolving concept of smart sustainable cities, are driving research into ever-smaller sizes of sensors capable of powerfully sensing complex and varied aspects of urban life and environment at very low cost. The production of sensing devices with a low <b>cost-to-performance</b> <b>ratio</b> is further driven by the rapid development of sensor manufacturing technologies (e.g. [19]). The increasing miniaturization of computer technology is making it possible to develop miniature on-body and remote sensors that allow registering various human and urban parameters without disturbing citizens or interfering with urban activities, thereby the commonsensical infiltration of sensors into daily urban life and environment. This is instrumental in enhancing the computational understanding and data processing of human mobility, urban dynamic processes, and urban operational functioning, a process that entails analysis, interpretation, modeling, and evaluation of big data for enhanced decision-making and deep insights. The new wave of urban computing is about the omnipresence of invisible technology in urban environments and thus citizens’ everyday life. Countless tiny, distributed, networked sensor devices will be invisibly embedded in cities for data collection. The {{research in the area of}} micro- and nano-engineering [74] is expected to yield major shifts in ICT performance and the way mechatronic components and devices are manufactured, designed, modeled, and implemented, thereby radically changing the nature and structure of sensing devices and thus the way cities will be monitored, understood, analyzed, probed, and planned in the near future.|$|E
40|$|The {{technologies}} {{necessary to}} enable detailed numerical simulations of complete propulsion systems {{are being developed}} at the NASA Glenn Research Center in cooperation with industry, academia and other government agencies. Large scale, detailed simulations will be of great value to the nation because they eliminate some of the costly testing required to develop and certify advanced propulsion systems. In addition, time and cost savings will be achieved by enabling design details to be evaluated early in the development process before a commitment is made to a specific design. This concept is called the Numerical Propulsion System Simulation (NPSS). NPSS consists of three main elements: (1) engineering models that enable multidisciplinary analysis of large subsystems and systems at various levels of detail, (2) a simulation environment that maximizes designer productivity, and (3) a cost-effective, high-performance computing platform. A fundamental requirement of the concept is that the simulations must be capable of overnight execution on easily accessible computing platforms. This will greatly facilitate the use of large-scale simulations in a design environment. This paper describes {{the current status of}} the NPSS with specific emphasis on the progress made over the past year on air breathing propulsion applications. Major accomplishments include the first formal release of the NPSS object-oriented architecture (NPSS Version 1) and the demonstration of a one order of magnitude reduction in computing <b>cost-to-performance</b> <b>ratio</b> using a cluster of personal computers. The paper also describes the future NPSS milestones, which include the simulation of space transportation propulsion systems in response to increased emphasis on safe, low cost access to space within NASA's Aerospace Technology Enterprise.

40|$|At present, {{a plethora}} of {{techniques}} is available to study molecular systems and chemical reactions. In this light, ab initio many body techniques enable us, without any experimental input, to compute molecular energetics and {{a whole range of}} chemical properties. A twofold classification can be made, separating wave function based methods (such as Hartree-Fock) from density functional theory (DFT). In this thesis, the focus mainly lies on the density functional method, both from a conceptual as computational viewpoint - for the latter, one of the reasons being its excellent <b>cost-to-performance</b> <b>ratio.</b> The formulation of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorems in 1964 provided the starting point for the fast development of fundamental DFT, yielding all basic ingredients for a complete many-body theory. In a next step, Kohn and Sham introduced orbitals within the formalism, paving the way to a breakthrough of DFT as an important computational tool within modern chemistry. In addition to these developments, much {{attention has been paid to}} the insights DFT can give into chemical reactivity. In particular, the density functional methodology provides an excellent framework to define a variety of well-known chemical concepts. In this thesis, the applicability of several fundamental DFT-based reactivity indicators has been tested for a variety of reactions occurring in diverse domains of chemistry. The chemical potential, global hardness and global softness are used to discuss the reactive behavior of one single molecule or a set of related molecules, providing reactivity sequences for the latter. The Fukui function is used as an intra-molecular descriptor, whereas the local softness can provide inter-molecular reactivity information about regio selectivity. In order to test the usefulness of the aforementioned properties, they are usually used in conjunction with well-known chemical principles such as the electronegativity equalization, the principle of maximum hardness and the hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB) principle. A validation of the results is obtained through comparison with ab initio thermodynamic and kinetic data. In general, DFT-based concepts have proven to be of great use in the interpretation of a variety of experimental and theoretical results. It remains nevertheless challenging to make predictions about their success or failure for specific types of interactions. In order to rely on the indicators as independent and/or predictive tools for the description of chemical reactivity, there is need for practical guidelines describing which indicators are suitable for a certain problem. The descriptors probe electronic interactions, however it is clear that they do not monitor other effects, such as steric contributions. Whenever the indicators are tested, their limitations must a priori be kept in mind. For instance, some of the reactions studied in this work exhibit high reaction barriers due to large steric hindrance effects between the two reactants and thus, the indicators are not expected to be successful. The largest group of applications concerns radical reactions. The majority of them occur during the formation of coke, which is a side process of thermal cracking of hydrocarbons. Radical systems are particularly interesting and challenging. However so far only a handful of papers examined and discussed their behavior using reactivity descriptors. In the specific case of hydrogen abstraction reactions at polyaromatic species by a methyl radical, accurate, reliable and yet affordable thermodynamic and kinetic data have been obtained. Other studied bimolecular radical reactions are addition reactions of radicals to small olefins and the initiation and first propagation steps within the polymerization process of polyethylene and poly(vinylchloride). Overall, it can be concluded that the radical Fukui function is capable of indicating the preferred site of reaction. This clearly indicates the importance of frontier orbital effects for this specific type of interaction. The local HSAB principle was also successfully applied, leading to correct reactivity sequences when related molecules were compared with each other. Hence the local softness is a suitable indicator for studying bimolecular radical reactions. This is in accordance with earlier suggestions and with the categorization of Klopman, as the larger radicals are characterized by high global softness values. Whereas the local viewpoint leads to satisfactory results, the global HSAB principle fails for some specific bimolecular radical reactions and is therefore not recommended. In addition to these bimolecular reactions, two examples of unimolecular radical cyclization reactions have also been studied. For these reactions, the Fukui function is used to describe the intra-molecular regio selectivity. However, the correct site of cyclization could not be indicated. Since these reactions correspond to a constrained charge transfer - the spin number remains constant, whereas the total number of electrons changes at a local level - the spin-polarized reactivity descriptors, and in particular the spin-polarized Fukui function has been tested and indeed, its usefulness is demonstrated. A second group of studied bimolecular reactions correspond to typical reactions occurring within zeolite catalysis. The small probe molecules are characterized as hard systems, and both polar and apolar representatives were chosen. The zeolite catalyst was modelled by a small 5 -tetrahedral cluster, and in addition to the traditional oxygen-bridged cluster the influence of amine substitution was tested. These reactions were difficult to describe using DFT-based reactivity descriptors. The global HSAB principle fails for the interactions with the polar molecules, as in these cases polarization effects - which are not included in the purely electron transfer process - are dominant. In contrast, the reactions between the zeolite clusters and the apolar molecules do follow the HSAB rule. From a local point of view, the complex mechanism of these concerted reactions, occurring simultaneously at the acid and basic site of the zeolite framework, could not be specified based on local descriptors. Multiple-site interactions in general remain a domain for further research. In addition, the local hardness might be more suitable to describe interactions with hard molecules, although at present the calculations remain troublesome and no practical scheme is presented yet. A final application concerns a unimolecular ionic cyclization reaction leading to the formation of a four-membered beta-lactam ring. This is an example in which competing pathways can take place because the formation of the more stable six-membered ring, instead of the strained four-membered ring, is initially expected. The anion reactant is a very soft species and the traditional local indicator, i. e. the Fukui function, succeeds in correctly predicting the preferred reaction path. Therefore the indicator adds to the unravelling of the origin of the experimentally observed cyclization preference. Moreover, extension to bimolecular reactions using this anion reactant also revealed the successful applicability of the local softness, as also these results were in correspondence with reaction barriers obtained at 0 Kelvin. In this thesis, one of the main advantages of using reactivity descriptors was accentuated, in particular their low computational cost. Not only do they solely require information from the reactants, but it was furthermore demonstrated that reactivity sequences are mainly independent of the level of theory used for geometry optimizations as well as for single-point energy calculations. An extended set of theoretical procedures, ranging from simple ab initio methods such as Hartree-Fock, over a very popular and successful functional, to the latest class of highly promising methods. The observation of level-of-theory independency for the calculation of the global descriptors is highly reassuring and adds to the reliability of DFT-based reactivity indicators. It must however be emphasized that overall the perturbative approach should be used complementary to information obtained from thermodynamics and kinetics...|$|E
