In 2014, 5 plant water extracts (Artemisia arborescens, Euphorbia characias, Rhus coriaria, Thymus vulgaris, Lantana camara) were prepared and distributed on durum wheat cv Valbelice to evaluate their potential herbicidal effects. After crop harvesting, the major physicochemical and technological parameters of wholemeal flours obtained from each treatment were measured and compared with those from <b>chemical</b> <b>weeding</b> and untreated controls.

40|$|The {{researcher}} {{investigated the}} effectiveness of <b>chemical</b> <b>weeding,</b> mechanical weeding and hand hoeing on a maize crop variety SCSI 3 in terms of growth rate, yields and cost analysis benefit. The researcher used the experimental study design {{in order to find}} out which weeding management method promotes fast growth, gives higher yields and is less expensive in terms of cost compared with yields realized. The researcher had three treatments which were replicated. Treatment A was under <b>chemical</b> <b>weeding,</b> treatment B under mechanical weeding and treatment C under hand hoeing. The researcher found out that during the first four weeks there were not much differences in terms of growth rate Plants under chemical method delayed germination but picked up after two weeks. After four weeks the plants in treatment A grew vigorously to surpass B and C. The results indicate that <b>chemical</b> <b>weeding</b> promotes a relatively faster growth rate in maize production. Also observed as the three treatments were used, are the differences in terms of growth after mechanical and hand hoeing. If the rain does not come immediately after weeding the crops show moisture stress and the growth rate is retarded. The crops under <b>chemical</b> <b>weeding</b> take long to show signs of moisture stress even if the rain has taken long to come. Also noted were the differences in grain quality, treatment A had maize seed from the cobs being of high texture quality. Maize in treatments B and C had maize seeds from the cobs of lower quality. The researcher concluded that chemical weed control method is more effective and less costly as compared to mechanical or hand hoeing. So all those farmers who have serious shortage of weeding manpower and those where weeding labour is expensive can use herbicides in controlling weeds but may need to continuously carry out soil tests. Those farmers who have abundant free family labour may continue using it as the very long term effects of herbicides on soil micro organisms may be negative...|$|E

Vector abundance in vineyards is favored by stinging nettle growing in surrounding areas. Nettle control by herbicides or cutting can reduce vector population in vineyards. However, <b>chemical</b> <b>weeding</b> can cause environmental problems. Many authors suggest that stinging nettle control applied during H. obsoletus flight could force adults to migrate into vineyards.

40|$|International audienceDitch {{networks}} were traditionally {{designed to protect}} fields from soil erosion or control waterlogging. They are still frequently managed by either mowing, <b>chemical</b> <b>weeding,</b> dredging or burning to ensure their optimal hydraulic capacity. Ditches were recently reported also to improve water quality and sustain biodiversity. These ditch functions are related to specific ditch properties. By contrastingly modifying ditch properties, maintenance operations were supposed to regulate these functions. There is, therefore, a need to re-examine the design and maintenance strategies of ditches to optimize {{the whole range of}} ecosystem services that they provide. In this study, we address the innovator question of how maintenance operations affect the yearly evolution of ditch properties, and in turn, the panel of functions that ditches support. During one year, we monitored the vegetation, litter, soil properties, and ash cover of five ditches that were being unmanaged, dredged, mowed, burned, and chemically weeded, respectively, with timing and frequency as generally operated by farmers in the study area. We then used indicators to evaluate the effect that the evolution of these properties has on the ditch water conveyance, herbicide retention and biodiversity conservation functions. We found that the evolution of these properties significantly contrasted among the 5 maintenance strategies. All the maintenance operations cleared the vegetation, which improves the hydraulic capacity by up to 3 times. The optimal hydraulic capacity is maintained longer after <b>chemical</b> <b>weeding</b> and dredging, but these operations have negative impacts on the herbicide retention and biodiversity conservation functions. The litter and ash layers generated by mowing and burning, respectively, improve the herbicide retention by up to 45 %.

Using classification trees, we tested the ability of the following three explanatory variables to determine the choice of practice: (1) the trafficability of the plot, (2) the percentage of plots with low trafficability within the vineyard of the farm holding, and (3) the wine grower residence place. Our results show that the trafficability classifies 59 % of plots. The percentage of plots with low trafficability classifies 76 % of plots. The wine grower residence place classifies 84 % of the plots. Although the choice of practice correlated with soil trafficability, the residence place of the wine grower unexpectedly over-determined the practice choice.

(Fumatory), Euphorbia helioscopia L., Melilotns indica L., Chenopodium album L. (Lamb's quarters), Medicago polymorpha L. (Wild medic), Avena futua L. (Wild oat), Convolvulns arvensis L. (Field bind weed), Trianthema monogymna L., Cuprus rotundus L., Sorghun helepense L. (Pers), Digera avensis L., Echinochloa colona L. (Link) and Cynodon dctylon L. (Pers) during both the study years. The effect of these weed control measures on yield and yield components of wheat (Triticum aestivum (L) Corn (Zea mays L.), Mungbean (Vigna radiata) and cowpeas (Vigna unguiculata) was assessed. Different weed control methods suppressed significantly weed population, fresh and dry matter and increased mortality percentage of weeds under study. Among different weed control techniques, integrated weeding, i. e., <b>chemical</b> <b>weeding</b> at 2 - 3 leaf stage of weeds with a fallow-up hand weeding after 50 days of crop sowing (WC 6) gave promising results closely followed by Mechanical weeding after 20 days of crop sowing with a follow-up hand weeding after 50 days of crop sowing (WC 5) and/or two hand weedings after 20 and 40 days of crop sowing (WC 2). Maximum weed mortality percentage was noted with these treatments. These weed control methods out yielded the yield and yield components of crops under study during both the study years (2003 - 2004). The economic analysis of these weed control techniques showed again better performance of WC 6 (<b>Chemical</b> <b>weeding</b> at 2 - 3 leaf stage of weeds + Hand Weeding at 50 DAS) as compared to rest of the treatments under all cropping patterns {{during the study period}} (2003 - 2004). Maximum percentage value of harvest index was calculated with WC 6 for all cropping patterns. A significant positive interaction between cropping patterns and weed control methods was observed during both of the years...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{design of}} {{mechanical}} arm for laser weeding robot is described. The long term {{objective of the}} project is the replacement of <b>chemical</b> <b>weeding</b> by laser weeding. The distinguishing feature of this design {{is the use of}} a mechanical arm, which is equipped with a laser generator and a control center consisted of a single chip microcomputer and two driver hybrid ICs. The mechanical arm comprises two stepping motors vertically linked together. The robot moves ahead one step, the working area of laser generator is divided into 10 × 10 grids. Through the inverse operation of mechanical arm, the motor displacement angle of each grid is calculated. Mechanical arm turns to designated position if single chip gets weeds position information. The result of the design is a key executive mechanism of laser weeding. The operation error of mechanical arm is analyzed. The arm can point the laser beam towards the target weeds with small error. After the order of the execution areas is optimized, the length of arm moving path is shorter. Analysis of the running track shows that the sequence of execution area is feasible and reasonable...|$|E
40|$|Weeds {{has become}} a big problem in system of rice {{intensification}} (SRI), integrated crop management (ICM) and conventional cultivation systems. The objective of the research was to study the dominancy and potential of harmful effect of weed in these three cultivation systems. The research was conducted at Sukamandi research station of Indonesian Center for Rice Research, Subang, from November 2013 to April 2014 during rainy season. The experiment was arranged in a split plot design with four replications. The cultivation systems was main plot consisted of system of rice intensification (SRI), integrated crop management (ICM) and conventional system. The weeding techniques as subplot consisted of no weeding, manual weeding, mechanical weeding and <b>chemical</b> <b>weeding.</b> The result showed that based on dry mass of weeds the highest risk of weed was exhibited at SRI with total dry mass of weed 51. 53 g m- 2 (0. 5 ton ha- 1) and the lowest was at conventional system with 32. 45 g m- 2 (0. 3 ton ha- 1). Proper weed control increased rice production by 28. 9 % for SRI, by 29. 4 % for ICM and by 14. 6 % for conventional cultivation systems...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 There is a {{critical}} lack of economic information {{in the area of}} <b>chemical</b> <b>weed</b> control. This paper is intended to stimulate study in this area. The objective is to develop a method of economic analysis of alternative herbicide practices. The data used were taken from a Druchamp winter wheat trial conducted on the Hyslop Agronomy Research Station at Oregon State University in 1966. Diuron and linuron were used at four dosage levels at pre and postemergence. Production functions for the four herbicide treatments were determined for all alternatives. Price ratios of herbicide and wheat were used to determine points of profit maximization. Limits were established for levels of profitable herbicide use. Within these limits, alternatives may be selected depending on the prevailing price ratio conditions. The results from this analysis are in no way indications of recommended herbicide practice due to the experimental data used. One practice however, was found to be superior to all other alternatives in this problem analysis. In the concluding remarks, the values and limitations of this approach are discussed. The principal weakness is a lack of adequate information to be used by economic analyses. A discussion is included of economic aspects of herbicide use that have not been fully investigated. Suggestions are made for topics of future economic study that would be valuable contributions to the field of <b>chemical</b> <b>weed</b> control...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to develop an {{integrated}} weed control strategy against annual weeds in spring oilseed rape {{by means of a}} combined mechanical and <b>chemical</b> <b>weed</b> control which will be performed concurrently and separately. The project encompasses field experiments in which different combinations of inter-row hoeing and intra-row herbicide treatments will be evaluated and compared to conventional weed control treatments with broadcast spraying of herbicides, and experiments in which an implement for concurrent inter-row hoeing and intra-row herbicide treatment will be refined and evaluated. In 2012, an implement for intra-row spraying combined with row hoeing was developed and evaluated in two field experiments in spring oilseed rape {{in the southern part of}} Sweden. The effects of inter-row hoeing, intra row spraying, and combination of the two methods were compared with conventional broadcast spraying. Preliminary results showed that the best weed control effects were obtained with the combination of inter-row hoeing and intra-row spraying in both experiments. Regarding crop yield, the yield was significantly higher in the combined treatment in one of the experiments while no effects on the yields were obtained in the other experiment. We envisage that the inter-row hoeing and intra-row herbicide treatment will diminish the overall use of herbicides to less than one third in comparison with the more conventional <b>chemical</b> <b>weed</b> control methods, while having the same weed control effect...|$|R
