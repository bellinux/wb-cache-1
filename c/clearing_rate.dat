The recruitment of macrophages helps improve the <b>clearing</b> <b>rate</b> of myelin debris. The resident macrophages present in the nerves release further chemokines and cytokines to attract further macrophages. The degenerating nerve also produce macrophage chemotactic molecules. Another source of macrophage recruitment factors is serum. Delayed macrophage recruitment was observed in B-cell deficient mice lacking serum antibodies. These signaling molecules together cause an influx of macrophages, which peaks during the third week after injury. While Schwann cells mediate the initial stage of myelin debris clean up, macrophages come in to finish the job. Macrophages are facilitated by opsonins, which label debris for removal. The 3 major groups found in serum include complement, pentraxins, and antibodies. However, only complement has shown to help in myelin debris phagocytosis.|$|E

If the worker's next best job opportunity offers lower pay than his current position, he will have an incentive to perform well to keep his current job. In [...] "turnover cost" [...] models, firms pay their workers above market wages to prevent turnover and the costs of recruiting and training replacement employees.

Formal regulation {{is a key}} mechanism by which governments seek to protect forests. However, whether regulation can effectively protect remaining areas of the most threatened and most heavily cleared forests is unknown. We addressed this question using forest loss data for Queensland, Australia between 2000 and 2014 under existing vegetation clearing regulation (Vegetation Management Act 1999). This regulation is specifically designed to provide the greatest protection for threatened forest types that have already lost {{the greatest amount of}} their original extent. Importantly, enforcement and governance of this regulation is relatively strong allowing an assessment of regulation design. We applied path analysis to model the direct and indirect effects (mediated by variables representing deforestation pressure) of forest protection level on <b>clearing</b> <b>rates.</b> There was strong evidence for a decline in <b>clearing</b> <b>rates</b> over time, except of clearing for non-agricultural purposes. However, threatened forest types, which have already lost > 70 % of their original extent and should have the greatest level of protection under the regulation, continue to be cleared 2. 7 – 2. 9 times faster than non-threatened forest types. There was also little evidence that the regulation has driven greater reductions over time in the <b>clearing</b> <b>rates</b> of threatened versus non-threatened forests types. There was much greater support for the indirect than direct effect of protection level. This is because protection level was correlated with variables associated with deforestation pressure, resulting in higher <b>clearing</b> <b>rates</b> for threatened compared to non-threatened forest types. We hypothesise that this arises because the additional protection afforded to threatened relative to non-threatened forests is insufficient to counter the continuing higher level of deforestation pressure on threatened forests. We argue that a potential solution is to build explicit targets for forest retention into regulation, below which no further forest loss is permitted. This could be combined with spatially targeted enforcement and incentive strategies where threats are highest...|$|R

Unpublished draft mapping of native woody vegetation types, based on 1985 aerial photography and a large set of floristic data from field surveys, {{was used as a}} baseline for this study. Mapping of clearing was carried out by intensive visual interpretation of Landsat TM satellite imagery. Systematic validation, which compared the satellite interpretation to low-level aerial photography at randomly allocated point locations, showed that the method was highly accurate in detecting vegetation clearing including in the open woodlands and shrublands that characterise much of the study area. Comparisons with previously published mapping of statewide clearing patterns, based on an automated classification of Landsat TM imagery, showed that our intensive visual interpretation detected substantially more clearing. Average annual <b>clearing</b> <b>rates</b> were 8 times higher that those derived from the previous mapping.

We found that, over a 50 year regrowth period, the reduction of precipitation caused by large-scale deforestation was not sufficient to prevent secondary forest regrowth, but this decrease in precipitation combined with nutrient limitation, due to logging and frequent fires, did indeed prevent forest regrowth in central and southern Amazonia, leading to a savannization.

Instead, the mutation impairing transcription of at least the two toxin genes is located in a new genetic locus, which acts together with the BvgA/S two-component regulatory system on the expression of a subset of virulence genes. Further analysis suggested that most presumably the mutation affects a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein which contributes to transcriptional activation.

40|$|Under the U. S. National Banking System (NBS), {{in effect}} from 1863 [...] 1914, banks with {{national}} charters could issue notes under four main restrictions: full collateral {{in the form}} of government bonds, a per-period tax on outstanding notes, redemption of notes into (outside) money on demand, and a clearing fee per issued note that is cleared through the Treasury's clearing system. The simple and predominant view of this system appeals to arbitrage to claim that the system should have produced an upper bound on the yield on collateral: the tax rate plus the product of the clearing fee and the average <b>clearing</b> <b>rate</b> of notes. However, as is well known and puzzling, yields on eligible collateral were generally higher than such a bound. We explain the puzzle by a model of note issue that includes the main features of the NBS. In the model, note issuers choose to issue notes only in trades that both produce a low <b>clearing</b> <b>rate</b> (high float) and are subject to diminishing returns, and there exists a steady state with a yield on collateral higher than the presumed bound. There are two main ingredients in our explanation: the concern about float and the inverse association between the float rate and the size of placement opportunities. The former is dictated by the rules for note issue. The latter is consistent with the notion that large placement opportunities would have been available only in organized markets, but notes used in such markets would have quickly been turned in to other banks and then been through the clearing system. To achieve high float, notes should be offered in trade to people who are infrequently connected to such markets, and such placement opportunities give rise to diminishing returns from additional note issue. We formulate the model with most of the background environment same as that of the Trejos-Wright-Shi model. For each specialization type, there is a small portion of â€œbankersâ€ while the remainder is â€œnonbankers. " There are three kinds of assets: (outside) money, notes issued by bankers, and bonds issued by government. Each date has two stages, the "morning" and the "afternoon. " The morning is reserved for the random pairwise meetings. The afternoon is reserved for bankers meeting the government and is used solely for note-clearing, bond purchases, and the levying of taxes and fees. Hence, a banker’s notes have two potential uses: to purchase eligible collateral and to purchase goods or other bankers' notes in pairwise meetings. Each use gives rise to different amounts of float. We assume that government clears all notes in inventory at the start of each afternoon. As a result, a banker does not use its own notes to purchase bonds because the potential float is not enough to overcome the redemption fee. Nevertheless, a banker does use its notes in pairwise meetings to trade for goods and to trade for other bankers' notes. This use gives rise to random and higher float, and, implies a diminishing marginal return from additional note issue. National banking system; note issuance; matching model...|$|E
40|$|The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{proposed}} a standard global assessment protocol {{for the evaluation of}} conservation risks to ecosystems. The assessment criteria mirror the IUCN protocol for the assessment of species, however there are relatively few case studies available to demonstrate their utility across a broad range of ecosystems. We applied the IUCN protocol to assess the conservation status of the Cumberland Plain Woodland (CPW) located in the western suburbs of Sydney, Australia. The ecosystem {{has been the focus of}} extensive survey and research and has been determined to be critically endangered under NSW and Australian Government legislation, primarily as a consequence of its history of extensive clearing. The outcome of the risk assessment for CPW using the IUCN protocol was identical to those under the NSW and Australian legislation. Data for risk assessment fell into two categories, each with different limitations. Phytosocialogical data and distribution models provided a strong basis for quantifying past and future changes in the distribution of CPW, but offered only indirect measures of functional symptoms of decline. Conversely, local case studies documenting declines in ecosystem function due to weed invasion, soil disturbance and alteration of fire regimes could not easily be extrapolated in order to evaluate the assessment criteria. The critically endangered rating was based solely on the historic reduction in geographic distribution (92 – 94 %), however clearing poses an ongoing threat to the ecosystem. The contemporary <b>clearing</b> <b>rate</b> of CPW is approximately half the historical average but there is evidence that the rate will double in the next decade as a consequence of ongoing urbanisation and Government policy of biodiversity offsets.

40|$|Indices for site {{prioritization}} {{are widely}} used to address the question: which sites are most important for conservation of biodiversity? We investigate the theoretical underpinnings of target-based prioritization, which measures sites 2 ̆ 7 contribution to achieving predetermined conservation targets. We show a strong connection between site prioritization and the mathematical theory of voting power. Current site prioritization indices are afflicted by well-known paradoxes of voting power: a site can have zero priority despite having non-zero habitat (the paradox of dummies) and discovery of habitat in a new site can raise the priority of existing sites (the paradox of new members). These paradoxes arise because of the razor 2 ̆ 7 s edge nature of voting, and therefore we seek a new index that is not strictly based on voting. By negating such paradoxes, we develop a set of intuitive axioms that an index should obey. We introduce a simple new index, "fraction-of-spare," that satisfies all the axioms. For single-species site prioritization, the fraction-of-spare(s) of a site s equals zero if s has no habitat for the species and one if s is essential for meeting the target area for the species. In-between those limits it is linearly interpolated, and equals area(s) /(total area - target). In an evaluation involving multi-year scheduling of site acquisitions for conservation of forest types in New South Wales under specified <b>clearing</b> <b>rates,</b> fraction-of-spare outperforms 58 existing prioritization indices. We also compute the optimal schedule of acquisitions for each of three evaluation measures (under the assumed <b>clearing</b> <b>rates)</b> using integer programming, which indicates {{that there is still}} potential for improvement in site prioritization for conservation scheduling...|$|R
