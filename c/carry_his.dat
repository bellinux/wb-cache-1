5|$|Flower {{became the}} first player to <b>carry</b> <b>his</b> bat in two {{different}} international formats when he also carried his bat in a Test against Pakistan at Bulawayo in 1998; since then, Anwar, Stewart, Gayle and Javed Omar of Bangladesh have also managed this feat.|$|E

5|$|Motley {{took the}} 1954 season off and {{attempted}} a comeback in 1955 after the Browns, who still had rights to Motley under his contract, traded {{him to the}} Pittsburgh Steelers for Ed Modzelewski. In Pittsburgh he played seven games as a linebacker, but the Steelers released him {{before the end of}} the season. In his eight years in the AAFC and NFL, Motley had rushed for 4,712 yards and averaged 5.7 yards per <b>carry.</b> <b>His</b> career rushing average is still an all-time record for running backs.|$|E

5|$|A senior {{national}} team official, Colonel Roman Lisiewicz of the Polish Army, {{said he saw}} the goalkeeper and the journalist reach the hotel in a taxi soon after 05:00—but rather than going to his room, Młynarczyk then left again with Zieliński before returning again around 07:00. Tired and hungover, Młynarczyk joined {{the rest of the}} players for breakfast, and according to Terlecki spent most of the meal getting worked up about possible managerial retribution. Młynarczyk was in such bad shape that he was unable to <b>carry</b> <b>his</b> own bags; Smolarek took them for him. Next to the team bus, one of Kulesza's assistants, Bernard Blaut, confronted Smolarek and told him that Młynarczyk was to stay behind.|$|E
5|$|For {{the rest}} of the war, Leopold was held under house-arrest in the Palace of Laeken. In 1941, while still incarcerated, he married Mary Lilian Baels, {{undermining}} his popularity with the Belgian public which disliked Baels and considered the marriage to discredit his claim to martyr status. Despite his position, he remained prominent in the occupied territory, and coins and stamps continued to <b>carry</b> <b>his</b> portrait or monogramme. While imprisoned, he sent a letter to Hitler in 1942 credited with saving an estimated 500,000 Belgian women and children from forced deportation to munitions factories in Germany. In January 1944, Leopold was moved to Germany where he remained for {{the rest of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|The Torah {{provides}} four details {{regarding the}} traditions surrounding Joseph’s remains. The account in Genesis relates that, before his death, {{he had his}} brothers swear they would <b>carry</b> <b>his</b> bones out of Egypt to Canaan. He is then {{said to have been}} embalmed then placed in a coffin in Egypt. In Exodus, we are told that Moses fulfilled the pledge by taking Joseph's bones with him when he left Egypt. In Joshua, Joseph’s bones are said to have been brought from Egypt by the Children of Israel and interred in Shechem.The bones of Joseph, which the Children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, were buried in Shechem in a parcel of land Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor, father of Shechem, for a hundred pieces of silver (qeśîṭâ)..|$|E

5|$|The {{street that}} runs beside Novi dvor, now {{the seat of}} the President of Serbia, was posthumously named Andrićev venac (Andrić's Crescent) in his honour. It also {{includes}} a life-size statue of the writer. The flat in which he spent his final years {{has been turned into a}} museum. The museum was opened more than a year after Andrić's death and houses books, manuscripts, documents, photographs and some of his personal belongings. Several of Serbia's other major cities, such as Novi Sad and Kragujevac, have streets named after him. Streets in a number of cities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, such as Sarajevo, Banja Luka, Tuzla, and Višegrad, also <b>carry</b> <b>his</b> name.|$|E
5|$|Despite a {{declaration}} from the German Governor Heinrich Schnee {{that neither the}} harbour nor its ships {{would be used for}} military purposes, the decision was taken by British Admiral Herbert King-Hall that the shipping in the port must nevertheless be neutralised. The Germans had pre-emptively scuttled a blockship in the port's entrance channel, with the intention of preventing Goliath and the other heavy British warships from entering the harbour to shell the undefended city. With close-range bombardment impossible, the British assembled assault teams with volunteers from the small blockading flotilla. Their mission was to augment the existing blockage by immobilising or sinking those cargo ships trapped in the port, thus denying its use to the Germans as well. Command of the assault was given to Commander Ritchie as the second most senior officer present, and he commandeered two small auxiliary gunboats, Dupleix and Helmuth, to <b>carry</b> <b>his</b> raiding parties.|$|E
5|$|In ODIs, {{there have}} been only 11 {{instances}} of a player carrying their bat. The first occasion was when Grant Flower made 84—in Zimbabwe's total of 205—against England in December 1994. The following year, Saeed Anwar became the first player to score an ODI century while carrying his bat; he made 103 against Zimbabwe in Harare. England's Nick Knight surpassed Anwar's score and went on to make 125 against Pakistan in 1996. , this remains a record in the ODI format. Australia's Damien Martyn and England's Alec Stewart are the only other players to score a century while performing this feat in ODIs. Sri Lanka's Upul Tharanga became the first cricketer from his team to carry the bat when he made 112 against Pakistan in October 2017. In T20Is, Chris Gayle is the only player to <b>carry</b> <b>his</b> bat, doing so against Sri Lanka during the 2009 ICC World Twenty20, scoring 63 runs in West Indies' total of 101.|$|E

5|$|The German {{troops were}} {{reluctant}} to attack head on once again, and Sergeant Vinz Kulbach pleaded with the officers of the 9th Fallschirmjäger Regiment to allow his men to flank the Americans in the dusk. Fifty men from Fusilier Regiment 27 of the 12th Volksgrenadier Division were dispatched to attack the American's southern flank through the woods. Just as Bouck was about to blow his whistle to indicate withdrawal, German soldiers penetrated their lines and began overrunning their foxholes. Several attackers were killed by grenades rigged to wires and triggered by Americans in their foxholes. Each of the positions spread out over the ridge top were overrun in turn. Surprisingly, the Germans did not simply kill the defenders in their foxholes. Bouck was pulled from his foxhole by an officer with a machine gun, {{and he thought he}} would be shot when the German put his weapon in his back and pulled the trigger; it was empty. Both Bouck and the German officer were then struck by bullets. The German fell seriously wounded, while Bouck was struck in the calf. Sergeant Kuhlbach asked Bouck who was in command, and Bouck replied that he was. Kuhlbach asked him why the Americans were still shooting, and Bouck said it was not his men doing it. Bouck surrendered and helped <b>carry</b> <b>his</b> wounded men down to the village.|$|E
