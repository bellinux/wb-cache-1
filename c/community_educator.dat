Here, we describe the advancement of CR principles through community participatory methods in the Los Angeles County Community Disaster Resilience (LACCDR) initiative. LACCDR, an initiative led by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health with academic partners, randomized 16 community coalitions to implement either an Enhanced Standard Preparedness or Community Resilience approach over 24 months. Facilitated by a public health nurse or <b>community</b> <b>educator,</b> coalitions comprised government agencies, community-focused organizations and community members. We used thematic analysis of data from focus groups (n = 5) and interviews (n = 6 coalition members; n = 16 facilitators) to compare coalitions’ strategies for operationalizing community resilience levers of change (engagement, partnership, self-sufficiency, education). We find that strategies that included bidirectional learning helped coalitions understand and adopt resilience principles. Strategies that operationalized community resilience levers in mutually reinforcing ways (e. g., disseminating information while strengthening partnerships) also secured commitment to resilience principles. We review additional challenges and successes in achieving cross-sector collaboration and engaging at-risk groups in the resilience versus preparedness coalitions. The LACCDR example can inform strategies for uptake and implementation of community resilience and uptake of the resilience concept and methods...|$|E

40|$|This thesis explores {{community}} education in Ireland in a threefold enquiry examining; (a) the core meaning which {{community education}} holds for practitioners in the field, (b) how {{the role of}} community educators shares a connectedness with liberatory struggle for social justice, and (c) what space community education and its educators occupy within its institutional provider, the Vocational Education Committees (VECs). Community education in Ireland is a vibrant field of practice operating {{on the fringes of}} mainstream education. Its origins {{can be traced to the}} early instructors of the Vocational Education Committees in the early part of the last century. Women’s community education has shaped the practice in Ireland since the 1970 s. The year 2000 marked a significant step forward in terms of recognition for community education with the publication of the White Paper on Adult Education. In this thesis the author draws on his experience working in the community education sector to engage with other community educators to reflect on the generative themes of meaning, educator role and institution in this field of practice. The first aspect of the research explores the meaning of community education from the practitioner perspective, and finds a clear preference for an empowerment meaning. However, the findings suggest there is no clear settlement on the meaning of empowerment, and concludes there is a need to articulate an understanding of empowerment in the context of a critical analysis of power. The second aspect of the research concerns the role of the <b>community</b> <b>educator</b> and the connectedness of this role to a broader liberatory struggle for social justice. Using Honneth’s concept of a struggle for recognition, the findings point to a critical role which is poorly recognized within the education field in Ireland. A key purpose of the research is to rediscover the roots of this role in Gramsci’s organic intellectuals and Freire’s radicals and reclaim the critical role of the <b>community</b> <b>educator</b> within the Irish education site. The third aspect of this research examines the space which community education occupies within its institutional provider, the Vocational Education Committees in Ireland. The research presents an assessment of the institutional culture of the VECs. The findings recall the VEC’s radical origins, and its later immersion within the mainstream educational apparatus. Findings point to the tensions between a dominant school ethos and subordinate community education ethos in the VEC and proposes a critical coalition for the future. The findings suggest that community education facilitators have a role to play in occupying a critical space within the VECs. The unique contribution of this research is that it presents a theorized community education from the perspective of its workers, the community educators. The research methodology combines Charmaz’s constructivist grounded theory with Freirean liberatory pedagogy. The result is a unique contribution to a generative grounded theorization of community education in Ireland today...|$|E

40|$|This action {{research}} explored {{the relationship between}} community and learning. The essence of community was examined through informal conversations with Hawaiian parents, service providers, and students involved in advocating for family/community centers in the schools. Community {{was found to be}} inversely related to alienation and defined by experience more than structure. Specifically, the sense of community consists of the senses of connection, meaning, empowerment, oneness with others, and a sense of harmony with all. A review of brain theory found that the processes of community making and the processes of learning are basically the same. Human development theorists recognize a gradient of lnaividual human development from self-preservation to community and harmony with all. In reconceptualizing community education, the most important criterion by which to judge prOgrams is whether they have produced a more positive sense of community among the participants, which in turn leads to higher levels of human development. Five objectives of community education were identified. The fundamental role of the <b>community</b> <b>educator</b> is to be a model learner and model the essence of community in policies, programs, and practices. The model of community education resulting from this study was used in the development of parent-community networking centers currently operating in Hawaii.

40|$|Nationally and in Philadelphia, {{urban school}} reform embraces {{the need for}} revised {{relations}} among families, communities and schools. Current conceptualizations of the relation among them is as overlapping and interactive with parents, community and educators being “partners” or “collaborators” {{in the education of}} children. Too often, however, reform treats forming partnerships and collaborations as something that will come naturally; reform designs overlook the challenges and tensions of creating new kinds of power relationships, often doubly complicated in urban schools by presumptions of deficit of low-income urban families and communities. ^ This study, utilizing qualitative research methods, examines the social processes set in motion at one school site by a community organizing initiative that was part of reform in Philadelphia for the purpose of transforming parent, <b>community,</b> <b>educator</b> relations. The research, situated inside the community organizing, revealed the meanings and purposes of a group of low-income minority parents for their participation in their children 2 ̆ 7 s school experience, a point of view often underrepresented in the literature on parent-educator relations. It analyzes {{the ways in which the}} parent group was successful (and not), through a planned organizing campaign around an issue that concerned them, in creating a discursive space for themselves within the institutional discourse of the school, thus constituting themselves as partners and collaborators with educators. ^ The research also showed that the community organizing, positioned at the intersection of families and schools, was a setting for purposeful literacy and learning, and one in which the knowledge parents have of their community was a valued asset. The often “hidden” community knowledge and literacies of urban parents, as well as their relational practices, present rich, but often unexplored areas for parent-educator collaboration. The illumination of these unanticipated areas for partnership shows urban parents to be constitutive of social and cultural assets, and not deficits, to the school experience of urban youth. ...|$|E
40|$|Sorry, {{the full}} text of this article is not {{available}} in Huskie Commons. Please click on the alternative location to access it. 213 p. This dissertation examined Malcolm X to assess his contributions to both the field of practice and the function of Adult Education in developing civil society. A review of literature was conducted and this provided a historical and societal context for understanding the historical barriers Blacks faced in receiving an education, the importance of non-formal learning as an alternative approach to teaching Black adults, and a means of developing the research themes used to guide this study. Three such themes were identified: <b>community</b> <b>educator,</b> community activist, precursor to the Afrocentric perspective. Kawaida Theory was employed to interpret the data collected around each of the three themes. Kawaida Theory, as an applied analytical tool, involves the use of an Afrocentric concept of culture, which was used to locate Malcolm X within the traditions of the African American culture. Kawaida Theory is comprised of seven subject areas: history, religion, social organization, political organization, economic organization, creative production, and ethos. Malcolm X's statements relative to each were analyzed around each of these. The findings of this study are that Malcolm X practiced non-formal adult education by using self-study, life experiences, and religious ideology during both phases of his life to critically examine Black life and teach Black adults through his public statements. Because Malcolm X's examination of Black life focused on the elimination of ignorance through educating Black people, there were at least three contributions of this study to adult education: (1) demonstrates the historical vacuum now found in adult education regarding the contributions of African Americans and promotes inquiry regarding other underrepresented groups; (2) illustrates the potential of Kawaida Theory as an analytical tool for the "intra-cultural" analysis of Black subjects; and (3) establishes Malcolm X as a recognized adult educator. Three suggestions are made for further research: (1) Black literature provides a useful tool to examine leaders or educational activities within the field of adult education, (2) the study of non-formal education in social movements has not been fully exploited, and (3) research within cultural traditions provides new dimensions of the field...|$|E
