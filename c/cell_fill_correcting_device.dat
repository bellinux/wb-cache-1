40|$|Consider a time-slotted, single-hop, {{wireless}} {{sensor network}} (WSN) consisting of n <b>correct</b> <b>devices</b> and and t=f*n Byzantine devices where f>= 0 is any constant; that is, the Byzantine devices may outnumber the correct ones. There exists a trusted sender Alice who wishes to deliver a message m over a single channel to the <b>correct</b> <b>devices.</b> There also exists a malicious user Carol who controls the t Byzantine devices and uses them to disrupt the communication channel. For a constant k>= 2, the <b>correct</b> and Byzantine <b>devices</b> each possess a meager energy budget of O(n^ 1 /k), Alice and Carol each possess a limited budget of Õ(n^ 1 /k), and sending or listening in a slot incurs unit cost. This general setup captures the inherent challenges of guaranteeing communication despite scarce resources and attacks on the network. Given this Alice versus Carol scenario, we ask: Is communication of m feasible and, if so, at what cost? We develop a protocol which, for an arbitrarily small constant ϵ> 0, ensures that at least (1 -ϵ) n <b>correct</b> <b>devices</b> receive m with high probability. Furthermore, if Carol's devices expend T energy jamming the channel, then Alice and the <b>correct</b> <b>devices</b> each spend only Õ(T^ 1 /(k+ 1)). In other words, delaying the transmission of m forces a jammer to rapidly deplete its energy supply and, consequently, cease attacks on the network...|$|R

40|$|DE 19911800 C UPAB: 20001128 NOVELTY - Electrochemical <b>cell</b> {{electrolyte}} <b>filling</b> equipment (1) comprises {{a filling}} cannula (6) {{passing through the}} <b>cell</b> <b>filling</b> socket (3). DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Equipment (1), for <b>filling</b> an electrochemical <b>cell</b> (2) with an electrolyte (9) consisting of salts dissolved in a room temperature gaseous solvent, comprises a vacuum pump (10) and an electrolyte supply unit (5) which can be connected gas-tightly to the cell. The supply unit (5) is connected to a cannula (6) which passes through the <b>cell</b> <b>filling</b> socket (3) and which prevents electrolyte contact with the socket. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a <b>cell</b> electrolyte <b>filling</b> process which uses the above equipment (1) and which comprises gas-tight insertion of the cannula (6) through the <b>cell</b> <b>filling</b> socket (3), positioning of the cannula end (6 b) just above the cell electrodes (15), evacuation of the cell (2) by the vacuum pump (10), <b>filling</b> of the <b>cell</b> with electrolyte (9) through the cannula (6), withdrawal of the cannula (6) to just above a closure device (V 8) and closure of the filling socket (3). USE - Especially for <b>filling</b> a rechargeable <b>cell</b> of the type described in DE 3826812 -A 1 with an electrolyte of lithium aluminum chloride dissolved in sulfur dioxide. ADVANTAGE - The cannula allows electrolyte introduction directly into the cell to avoid salt crystallization {{in the region of}} the filling socket and in the connection line and to prevent electrolyte composition change leading to salt crystallization within the cell...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, as {{continuation}} of our previous research, Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) lingual glands were investigated {{by means of}} transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to understand the cytoarchitecture and the subcellular sugar distribution within the different secretory structures. Indeed, glycosidic residues were visualized by applying an indirect technique of binding and the terminal sialoglycoconjugate sequences were characterized by employing sialidase digestion combined with lectin affinity. The ultrastructural analysis revealed an unusual cytoarchitecture of the caudal portion of anterior lingual gland that was composed of both secretory <b>cells,</b> <b>filled</b> with granules, and non-secretory <b>cells,</b> <b>filled</b> with mitochondria. Conversely, the posterior lingual gland was composed of secretory units of lingual glands only containing mucous <b>cells</b> <b>filled</b> with secretory granules with a variable morphology, including bipartite features characterized by an electron-lucent matrix and one or more electron-dense areas. Actual findings further supported that the quail lingual glands produce sialoglycoconjugates characterized by a heterogeneous composition. In conclusion, the cytological characteristics and the carbohydrate composition of quail lingual glands suggest that, analogously to mammal salivary glands, avian lingual glands could also be involved in several functions that can be correlated with the occurrence of sialic acids...|$|R
