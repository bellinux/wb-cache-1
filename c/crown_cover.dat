500|$|The central Buddha Hall is tall, with a large, paved courtyard. A porch {{leads to}} the open courtyard, which is two {{concentric}} circles with two temples: one in the outer circle and another in the inner circle. The outer circle has a circular path, {{with a number of}} large prayer wheels (nangkhor); this path {{leads to the}} main shrine, which is surrounded by chapels. Only one of the temple murals remains, depicting the arrival of Queen Wencheng and an image of the Buddha. The image, brought by the king's Nepalese wife and initially kept at Ramoche, was moved to Jokhang and kept in the rear center of the inner temple. This Buddha has remained on a platform since the eighth century; on a number of [...] occasions, it was moved for safekeeping. The image, amidst those of the king and his two consorts, has been gilded several times. In the main hall on the ground floor is a gilded bronze statue of Jowo Sakyamuni, [...] tall, representing the Buddha at age twelve. The image has a bejeweled <b>crown,</b> <b>cover</b> around its shoulder, a diamond on its forehead and wears a pearl-studded garment. The Buddha is seated in a lotus position on a three-tiered lotus throne, with his left hand on his lap and his right hand touching the earth. A number of chapels surround the Jowo Sakayamuni, dedicated to gods and bodhisattvas. The most important bodhisattva here is the Avalokiteshwara, the patron saint of Tibet, with a thousand eyes and a thousand arms. Flanking the main hall are halls for Amitabha (the Buddha of the past) and Qamba (the Buddha of the future).

Other terms used to mean [...] "an area with a high density of trees" [...] are wood, woodland, wold, weald, holt, frith and firth.

50|$|Analog diving watches {{must have}} a water {{resistant}} crown. Some models have the crown mounted in unconventional positions like 4, 8 or 9 o'clock to avert or reduce discomfort from the crown touching the wearers (left) wrist or back of the hand.

There are also watch models where a locking handle, separate knob or an extra <b>crown</b> <b>cover</b> has to be manipulated before the crown can be operated. There are however models that have crowns that are operated like the crowns of non diver's analog watches. Screw down or otherwise locking crowns and traditionally operated water resistant crowns can not be operated under water.|$|E
50|$|The ironsmelting furnace {{associated}} to these Urewe ceramics comprised a basin filled with fresh green leafy branches and herbs {{which served as}} a filter for the slag deposit at the base. Above the basin was a cone-shaped shaft, not unlike a chimney, made by superimposing rolls of damp clay. The decorated furnace, with its fluted patterns on the upper roll and deeply incised criss-cross or s-shaped patterns on the outer surface, may be reminiscent of the rim or neck of the ceramic pottery. Analyses carried out on the ironworking residue have not yet provided data on the efficiency of these furnaces, or whether they were a measure of their technical nature. Iron ore and fuel were readily available. The word “ubutare” meaning “iron” still crops up in many place names. The wooded <b>crown</b> <b>cover</b> was used to produce charcoal.

40|$|Abstract: In {{the present}} study, forest biomass mapping and {{estimates}} {{were carried out}} for a watershed in Garhwal Himalaya using stratified approach. IRS- 1 B, LISS II data of May 1994 with four spectral bands of spatial resolution 36. 25 m were used for forest type and <b>crown</b> <b>cover</b> mapping. The forest type-cum-crown cover map {{was used as a}} major base for forest biomass mapping, which was then integrated with ‘crown cover-biomass model’. Stand biomass for each site was computed from ground inventory using mean cbh, density and generalized species and interspecies allometric equations. Stand biomass values were related to the <b>crown</b> <b>cover</b> through allometric equations. Using these equations and mean <b>crown</b> <b>cover</b> for each individual class, mean biomass was computed for various components. The total biomass for each forest type was computed by using mean values and the areal extent of the class. Of the total geographical area of 113. 50 km 2, non-forested land occupied 54. 1 % area. Forest cover was distributed in five forest types and stratified into three <b>crown</b> <b>cover</b> classes ranged viz., 21 – 40 %, 41 – 60 % and 61 – 80 %. About 6. 8 % of the forest area (i. e. 3. 1 % of total area) was under 61 – 80 % <b>crown</b> <b>cover.</b> <b>Crown</b> <b>cover</b> of> 60 % was encountered only in mixed conifer forest. The forests with> 40 % <b>crown</b> <b>cover</b> occupied 78. 2 % of forest land (i. e. 35. 8 % of the total area). Total above ground biomass in entire study area including village woodlands was 1217. 94 × 103 t out of which 130. 31 × 103 t was in village wood-lands.

The definition of forest in China’s NFI has changed to some extent during different periods.
