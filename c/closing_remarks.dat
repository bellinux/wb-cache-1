In her second reading speech on behalf of the Tasmanian Opposition, Elise Archer said 'the NBN is an important infrastructure', but that 'the State Liberals have some concern that the NBN business model seems to rely more and more on eliminating competition and other technologies'.|$|E

25|$|This book {{details the}} trial of Dmitri Karamazov {{for the murder of}} his father Fyodor. The {{courtroom}} drama is sharply satirized by Dostoyevsky. The men in the crowd are presented as resentful and spiteful, and the women are irrationally drawn to the romanticism of Dmitri's love triangle with Katerina and Grushenka. Ivan's madness takes its final hold over him and he is carried away from the courtroom after recounting his final meeting with Smerdyakov and the aforementioned confession. The turning point in the trial is Katerina's damning testimony against Dmitri. Impassioned by Ivan's illness which she believes is a result of her assumed love for Dmitri, she produces a letter drunkenly written by Dmitri saying that he would kill Fyodor. The section concludes with the impassioned <b>closing</b> <b>remarks</b> of the prosecutor and the defense, and the verdict that Dmitri is guilty.|$|E

She states that she wants to be friends, and House retorts, as the <b>closing</b> <b>remark,</b> that it is the last thing he wants, with the unspoken {{suggestion}} that he wants more. The last scene involves House stroking his leg in pain, glancing at ibuprofen before deciding to pull a bottle of alcohol from his desk and drinking.|$|R
500|$|On 6 May, {{after having}} deliberated {{for a little}} over two hours, the jury found Brady guilty of all three murders and Hindley guilty of the murders of Downey and Evans. As the death penalty for murder had been {{abolished}} while Brady and Hindley were held on remand, the judge passed the only sentence that the law allowed: life imprisonment. Brady was sentenced to three concurrent life sentences and Hindley was given two, plus a concurrent seven-year term for harbouring Brady in the knowledge that he had murdered John Kilbride. Brady was taken to Durham Prison and Hindley was sent to Holloway Prison. In his <b>closing</b> <b>remarks</b> Atkinson described the murders as a [...] "truly horrible case" [...] and condemned the accused as [...] "two sadistic killers of the utmost depravity". He recommended that both Brady and Hindley spend [...] "a very long time" [...] in prison before being considered for parole but did not stipulate a tariff. He stated that Brady was [...] "wicked beyond belief" [...] and that he saw no reasonable possibility of reform. He did not consider that the same was necessarily true of Hindley, [...] "once she is removed from [...] influence". Throughout the trial Brady and Hindley [...] "stuck rigidly to their strategy of lying", and Hindley was later described as [...] "a quiet, controlled, impassive witness who lied remorselessly".|$|E
500|$|A general {{election}} debate, attended by party nominees Shumlin, Milne, Diamondstone and Feliciano and Independent candidates Ericson, Peters and Peyton, {{was held on}} October 9. It attracted considerable media attention and was described variously as [...] "funny", [...] "strange", [...] "crazy", [...] "one of the strangest of this election cycle", [...] "very, very special" [...] and [...] "beard-filled". Comments {{by all of the}} candidates apart from Shumlin drew media attention and laughter from the studio audience, such as Milne describing himself as [...] "third-generation, born in Vermont", only to correct himself and state that he was born in Brooklyn; Ericson, who sported a large bow-topped hat, suggesting that poor Vermonters use their food stamps to buy lottery tickets and decrying [...] "chemtrails"; Diamondstone, who wore jean shorts with suspenders and long socks and sported a large beard, calling for revolutionary socialism, the legalisation of all drugs and secession from the union, as well as comparing students to [...] "slaves" [...] because of the cost of higher education and responding to a question about the Department of Children and Families by railing against the U.S. military and the [...] "Zionist regime"; Peters answering a question about the affordability of college in Vermont by saying that he had [...] "no idea"; and self-described [...] "light worker" [...] Peyton shouting at Shumlin for allegedly closing highway restrooms and using her <b>closing</b> <b>remarks</b> to ask Vermonters if they'd rather choose money or love.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} a knowledge based {{approach to the}} formation of collaboration networks in basic research. Though mainly focused on foundations, it provides the example of a set of knowledge distributions supporting effort allocations that are pairwise equilibria of the collaboration game. These equilibrium outcomes produce a star-like collaboration network. Restrictions yielding the small world property are also specified.

2500|$|Socrates concludes that, in the virtuous {{people of}} {{the present and the}} past, at least, virtue has been the result of divine {{inspiration}}, akin to the inspiration of the poets, whereas a knowledge of it will require answering the basic question, 'What is virtue?'.

6000|$|When {{they came}} she made that {{statement}} {{to them in}} a plain matter-of-fact way, and just as if the thought never entered her mind that any one could doubt it after she had given her word that it was true. The men were evidently amazed and impressed to hear her say such a thing in such a sure and confident way, for prophecies boldly uttered never fall barren on superstitious ears. Yes, this speech certainly impressed them, but her <b>closing</b> <b>remark</b> impressed them still more. It was for the ringleader, and Joan said it sorrowfully: ...|$|R
30|$|A <b>closing</b> <b>remark</b> {{concerning}} life's complexity. Life {{is complex}} - that is undeniable. But {{that does not}} necessarily mean that the life principle is complex. In fact we would argue that the life principle is in some sense relatively simple! Indeed, simple rules can lead to complex patterns, as studies in complexity have amply demonstrated [67, 68]. So we would suggest that life, from its simple beginnings as some minimal replicating system, and following a simple rule - the drive toward greater dynamic kinetic stability within replicator space - is yet another example of that fundamental idea.|$|R

Both Harris and Herbert were sentenced to life {{imprisonment}} with the trial judge recommending that Harris should serve at least eighteen years and Herbert at least sixteen years and three months. In his <b>closing</b> <b>remarks</b> the judge described the attack as [...] "feral thuggery" [...] which {{raised questions about the}} [...] "sort of society which exists in this country". He added: [...] "This was a terrible case which has shocked and outraged all who have heard about it. At least wild animals, when they hunt in packs, have a legitimate reason for so doing, to obtain food. You have none and your behaviour on that night degrades humanity itself".|$|E
