First, the dynamics of the transfer paths between the noise control sources and the error microphones is compensated for by using a regularized state-space based adaptive filtered-error scheme. Second, for the reference signals a modified adaptive scheme is used, taking into account the nonwhiteness of these signals as well as the correlation between the individual signals.

40|$|Spectrum {{of acute}} renal failure in the {{intensive}} care unit: The PICARD experience. BackgroundAcute renal failure (ARF) in the critically ill is associated with extremely high mortality rates. Understanding the <b>changing</b> <b>spectrum</b> of ARF will be necessary to facilitate quality improvement efforts and to design successful interventional trials. MethodsWe conducted an observational cohort study of 618 patients with ARF in intensive care units at five academic medical centers in the United States. Participants were required to sign (or have a proxy sign) informed consent for data collection. A comprehensive data collection instrument captured more than 800 variables, most on a daily basis, throughout the course of ARF. Patient characteristics, dialysis status, and major outcomes were determined and stratified by clinical site. ResultsThe mean age was 59. 5 years, 41 % were women, and 20 % were of minority race or ethnicity. There was extensive comorbidity; 30 % had chronic kidney disease, 37 % had coronary artery disease, 29 % had diabetes mellitus, and 21 % had chronic liver disease. Acute renal failure was accompanied by extrarenal organ system failure in most patients, even those who did not require dialysis. Three hundred and ninety-eight (64 %) patients required dialysis. The in-hospital mortality rate was 37 %, and the rate of mortality or nonrecovery of renal function was 50 %. The median hospital length of stay was 25 days (26 days, excluding patients who died). ConclusionThere is a <b>changing</b> <b>spectrum</b> of ARF in the critically ill, characterized by a large burden of comorbid disease and extensive extrarenal complications, obligating the need for dialysis in the majority of patients. There is wide variation across institutions in patient characteristics and practice patterns. These differences highlight the need for additional multicenter observational and interventional studies in ARF...|$|E

In a dynamically <b>changing</b> <b>spectrum</b> environment, {{it is very important}} to design a distributed access scheme that can coordinate different users ' access adapt to spectrum dynamics with only local information. In this paper, we propose a self-learning repeated game framework for distributed primary-prioritized dynamic spectrum access through modeling the interactions between secondary users as a noncooperative game. With the proposed framework, the inefficiency due to users ' selfish behavior can be highly improved, and the secondary users can distributively obtain their optimal access probabilities with only local observations. The simulation results show that the proposed framework can achieve comparable performances with those of the centralized primary-prioritized dynamic spectrum access scheme. I...|$|E

40|$|We compare two {{temporal}} {{properties of}} classical double radio sources: i) radiative lifetimes of synchrotron-emitting particles and ii) dynamical source ages. We discuss how {{these can be}} quite discrepant from one another, rendering use of the traditional spectral ageing method inappropriate: we contend that spectral ages give meaningful estimates of dynamical ages only when these ages are << 10 ^ 7 years. In juxtaposing the fleeting radiative lifetimes with source ages which are significantly longer, a refinement of the paradigm for radio source evolution is required. The <b>changing</b> <b>spectra</b> along lobes are explained, not predominantly by synchrotron ageing but, by gentle gradients in a magnetic field mediated by a low-gamma matrix which illuminates an energy-distribution of particles, controlled largely by classical synchrotron loss in the high magnetic field of the hotspot. The energy in the particles is {{an order of magnitude}} higher than that inferred from the minimum-energy estimate, implying that the jet-power is of the same order as the accretion luminosity produced by the quasar central engine. This refined paradigm points to a resolution of the findings of Rudnick et al (1994) and Katz-Stone & Rudnick (1994) that both the Jaffe-Perola and Kardashev-Pacholczyk model spectra are invariably poor descriptions of the curved spectral shape of lobe emission, and indeed that for Cygnus A all regions of the lobes are characterised by a `universal spectrum'.

40|$|Cancer {{patients}} treated with chemotherapy {{are susceptible to}} bacterial infections. Therefore, all neutropenic cancer patients with fever receive standard therapy consisting of broad-spectrum antibiotics and hospitalization. However, febrile neutropenia in cancer patients is often due to other causes than bacterial infections. Therefore, standard therapy should be re-evaluated and new treatment strategies for patients with variable risk for bacterial infection should be considered. This paper reviews the <b>changing</b> <b>spectrum</b> of microorganisms and resistance of microorganisms to antibiotics in infection during neutropenia and discusses new strategies for the selection of patients with low-risk for bacterial infection using clinical and biochemical parameters such as acute phase proteins and cytokines. These low-risk patients may be treated with alternative therapies such as oral antibiotics, early discharge from the hospital or outpatient treatment. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

40|$|Background & objectives: Recently {{there were}} reports from all over India about <b>changing</b> <b>spectrum</b> of {{clinical}} presentation of severe malaria. The present study was planned to study {{the same in the}} northwest India. Methods: This prospective study was conducted on patients of severe malaria admitted in a classified malaria ward of a tertiary care hospital in Bikaner, Rajasthan (northwest India) during 1994 and 2001. It included adult patients of both sexes belonging to all age groups. The diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum was confirmed by demonstrating asexual form of parasites in peripheral blood smear. All patients were treated with i. v. /oral quinine. The specific complications were treated by standard WHO protocol. The data for individual complications for both the years were analysed by applying chi-square test. Results: In a prospective study in 1994 the spectrum of complication was dominated by cerebral malaria (25. 75 %) followed by jaundice (11. 47 %), bleeding tendencies (9. 59 %), severe anaemia (5. 83 %), shock (5. 26 %), Acute respiratory distress syndrome—ARDS (3. 01 %), renal failure (2. 07 %) and hypoglycemia (2. 07 %) whereas in 2001 it was dominated by jaundice (58. 85 %) followed by severe anaemia (26. 04 %), bleeding tendencies (25. 52 %), shock (10. 94 %), cerebral malaria (10. 94 %), renal failure (6. 25 %), ARDS (2. 08 %) and hypoglycemia (1. 56 %). The sharp difference for presence of jaundice and severe anaemia in 2001 and cerebral malaria in 1994 was statistically significant. Similarly, the important cause of mortality in 2001 was multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (71. 10 %) with predominant presentation of jaundice and renal failure, whereas in 1994, it was cerebral malaria (77. 96 %). Interpretation & conclusion: The observation of <b>changing</b> <b>spectrum</b> of severe malaria in this study and a significant increase in presentation with jaundice as an important manifestation is highly essential for primary, secondary and tertiary level health care providers for proper diagnosis and management.

40|$|Physicians {{treating}} HIV infection concentrate {{not only}} on the viral management but they also {{have to take into account}} the potential age and lifestyle-related conditions likely to influence long-term morbidity, correlated with patients' survival. Hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular, bone, kidney and liver disease, better than opportunistic infection, depict the <b>changing</b> <b>spectrum</b> of HIV disease in the HAART era. These conditions, the so called non infectious co-morbidities, are age-related diseases affecting the general population. However, their prevalence in HIV-infected individuals is higher, with earlier onset, probably as a result of the complex inter-relationship between HIV infection, co-infection and antiretroviral therapy. Regular screening for non infectious co-morbidities helps identify those asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals who are most at risk of developing comorbidities; this means that appropriate intervention, either by lifestyle changes to reduce modifiable risk factors or by the use of pharmacological management, can be initiated. © GERMS 2011...|$|E
