40|$|The <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>accident</b> is a {{major health}} issue, with medical and {{economic}} consequences upon the society. The <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>accident</b> determines the sensorial and motor impairment, the speech and postural control impairment. Some patients who had a <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>accident</b> may have difficulties in {{the response to the}} postural perturbations. Some patients who had a <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>accident</b> may have difficulties in the response to the postural perturbations. The recovery of the postural control and of the balance depends {{on the quality of the}} motor action in order to use the ADL and to ensure the social and professional reintegration of the patients. That is why the postural control is essential in the recovery of the patients who had a <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>accident.</b> The current study aims at the possibilities to regain the postural control for the patients with motor deficit by an individual program of recovery sessions. The current trial aimed at finding the way in which it is possible to influence the quality of life for the patients who had a <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>accident</b> by using the MBT physiotherapy device. The use of the MBT physiotherapy devices in the recovery programme of the postural control after the <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>accident</b> involves the need to set up an individualized programme of kinetic therapy. According to the established deficiency, namely the average one and the slight one, the recovery programme would need the introduction of techniques and methods whose effect is to reeducate the postural function. This can be done more easily if the recovery is initiated by using the MBT physiotherapy device that can intervene in the functional recovery which corresponds to each recovery stage...|$|R

In theoretical part I follow up the problematics of patients after <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>accident,</b> the anatomy and kinesiology of ankle joint, function of foot and gait. Also I describe the methods and effects of kinesiotaping. In practical part I used a qualitative research, processing two cases. I objectivisated the effect of kineziotape by a Footscan®. Kinesiotaping is used as a complementary therapy combined with other physiotherapeutical methods. For the purpose of my bachelor thesis I used kinesiotaping separately for easier evaluation of results. The purpose was {{to find out if the}} application of kineziotape on ankle joint in patients with <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>accident</b> enhaces the stand stability and gait.

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{management}} strategy remains controversial for patients presenting with type A acute aortic dissection with <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>accident</b> or coma. The present study aimed {{to help guide}} surgeons treating these high-risk patients. MethodsOf 1873 patients with type A acute aortic dissection enrolled in the International Registry for Acute Dissection, 87 (4. 7 %) presented with <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>accident</b> and 54 (2. 9 %) with coma. The hospital and 5 -year results were stratified by the presence and type of brain injury (no injury vs stroke vs coma) and management type (medical vs surgical). Independent predictors of short- and mid-term survival were identified. ResultsPresentation with shock, hypotension, or tamponade (46. 8 % vs 25. 2 %; P < . 001) and arch vessel involvement (55. 0 % vs 36. 1 %; P < . 001) was more likely in patients with brain injury. Surgical management was avoided more often in patients with coma (33. 3 %) or <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>accident</b> (24. 1 %) than in those without brain injury (11. 1 %; P < . 001). The overall hospital mortality was 22. 7 % without brain injury, 40. 2 % with <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>accident,</b> and 63. 0 % with coma (P < . 001). Mortality varied among the management types for both <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>accident</b> (76. 2 % medical vs 27. 0 % surgical; P < . 001) and coma (100 % medical vs 44. 4 % surgical; P < . 001). Postoperatively, <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>accident</b> and coma resolved in 84. 3 % and 78. 8 % of cases, respectively. On logistic regression analysis, surgery was protective against mortality in patients presenting with brain injury (odds ratio 0. 058; P < . 001). The 5 -year survival of patients presenting with <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>accident</b> and coma was 23. 8 % and 0 % after medical management versus 67. 1 % and 57. 1 % after surgery (log rank, P < . 001), respectively. ConclusionsBrain injury at presentation adversely affects hospital survival of patients with type A acute aortic dissection.

50|$|Palinopsia from <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>accidents</b> {{generally}} resolves spontaneously, {{and treatment}} should {{be focused on}} the vasculopathic risk factors. Palinopsia from neoplasms, AVMs, or abscesses require treatment of the underlying condition, which usually also resolves the palinopsia. Palinopsia due to seizures generally resolves after correcting the primary disturbance and/or treating the seizures. In persistent hallucinatory palinopsia, a trial of an anti-epileptic drug can be attempted. Anti-epileptics reduce cortical excitability and could potentially treat palinopsia caused by cortical deafferentation or cortical irritation. Patients with idiopathic hallucinatory palinopsia should have close follow-up.|$|E

40|$|Background and Aim: <b>Cerebrovascular</b> <b>accident</b> is a {{neurological}} disorder involves central nervous system. Studies {{have shown that}} it affects the outputs of behavioral auditory tests such as dichotic auditory verbal memory test. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare this memory test results between patients with <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>accident</b> and normal subjects. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 20 patients with <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>accident</b> aged 50 - 70 years and 20 controls matched for age and gender in Emam Khomeini Hospital, Tehran, Iran. Dichotic auditory verbal memory test was performed on each subject. Results: The mean score in the two groups was significantly different (p< 0. 0001). The results indicated that the right-ear score was significantly greater than the left-ear score in normal subjects (p< 0. 0001) and in patients with right hemisphere lesion (p< 0. 0001). The right-ear and left-ear scores were not significantly different in patients with left hemisphere lesion (p= 0. 0860). Conclusion: Among other methods, Dichotic auditory verbal memory test is a beneficial test in assessing the central auditory nervous system of patients with <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>accident.</b> It seems that it is sensitive to the damages occur following temporal lobe strokes...|$|R

5000|$|Leukostasis is {{an extreme}} form of leukocytosis (an excess of white blood cells) that is dangerously symptomatic. It is {{therefore}} also called symptomatic hyperleukocytosis. It is a {{white blood cell count}} above 100,000/μL. It is characterized by abnormal intravascular leukocyte aggregation and clumping. It is most often seen in leukemia patients. The brain and lungs are the two most commonly affected organs. Occluded microcirculation causes local hypoxemia and hemorrage manifesting as headache, blurred vision, transient ischemic attacks, <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>accidents</b> and dyspnea. It is an acute syndrome requiring aggressive cytoreductive modalities including chemotherapy and/or leukapheresis to both reduce the number of circulating leukocytes and to break apart any aggregates that have already formed. Such rapid and massive lysis of tissue poses risk of complications (tumor lysis syndrome), but it is necessary to avoid stroke.|$|E

We estimate that 98,000 more deaths than expected (8000-194,000) happened after the invasion outside of Falluja and far more if the outlier Falluja cluster is included. The major causes of death before the invasion were myocardial infarction, <b>cerebrovascular</b> <b>accidents,</b> and other chronic disorders whereas after the invasion violence was the primary cause of death. Violent deaths were widespread, reported in 15 of 33 clusters, and were mainly attributed to coalition forces. Most individuals reportedly killed by coalition forces were men.
