40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between and among parents, teachers, and administrators of elementary, junior and senior high school students regarding their perceptions of the difference between the present and desired applications of computer technology. The areas of computer technology were <b>computer</b> assisted <b>instruction,</b> <b>computer</b> managed <b>instruction,</b> and <b>computer</b> literacy. ^ The needs assessment survey, Applications of Computer Technology, was developed for the study. Respondents indicated to what extent they felt the school currently applied a particular area of computer technology and to what extent it should be applied. Responses were analyzed for each computer technology area by level (elementary, junior and senior high school) and sub-group (parents, teachers, and administrators). ^ The sample population was selected, through a random sampling technique, from parents, teachers, and administrators associated with the Lincoln Public Schools, Lincoln, Nebraska. ^ The following conclusions were drawn based on the perceptions of parents, teachers, and administrators surveyed: (1) Parents, teachers, and administrators perceived a need for greater implementation in all areas of computer technology. (2) Parents perceived a greater need for further implementation of <b>computer</b> assisted <b>instruction</b> and <b>computer</b> literacy than did teachers and administrators. (3) Elementary school parents, teachers, and administrators perceived a greater need for further implementation of <b>computer</b> managed <b>instruction</b> than junior high school parents, teachers, and administrators.
