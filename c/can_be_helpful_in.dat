5|$|Another {{contribution}} of gyroscopic effects is a roll moment {{generated by the}} front wheel during countersteering. For example, steering left causes a moment to the right. The moment is small compared to the moment generated by the out-tracking front wheel, but begins {{as soon as the}} rider applies torque to the handlebars and so <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>in</b> motorcycle racing. For more detail, see the section countersteering, below, and the countersteering article.|$|E
5|$|Argon is also {{commonly}} {{mixed with}} other gases, oxygen, helium, hydrogen and nitrogen. The addition {{of up to}} 5% oxygen (like the higher concentrations of carbon dioxide mentioned above) <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>in</b> welding stainless steel, however, in most applications carbon dioxide is preferred. Increased oxygen makes the shielding gas oxidize the electrode, {{which can lead to}} porosity in the deposit if the electrode does not contain sufficient deoxidizers. Excessive oxygen, especially when used in application for which it is not prescribed, can lead to brittleness in the heat affected zone. Argon-helium mixtures are extremely inert, and can be used on nonferrous materials. A helium concentration of 50–75% raises the required voltage and increases the heat in the arc, due to helium's higher ionization temperature. Hydrogen is sometimes added to argon in small concentrations (up to about 5%) for welding nickel and thick stainless steel workpieces. In higher concentrations (up to 25% hydrogen), it may be used for welding conductive materials such as copper. However, it should not be used on steel, aluminum or magnesium because it can cause porosity and hydrogen embrittlement.|$|E

To demonstrate the use of CitNetExplorer, we employ the tool to identify publi-cations dealing with the topic of community detection in networks. Citation-based scientific literature retrieval <b>can</b> <b>be</b> especially <b>helpful</b> <b>in</b> situations in which one needs to obtain a comprehensive overview {{of the literature on}} a cer-tain research topic, for instance in the preparation of a review article. ...|$|R
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} {{that the best way to}} prevent double depression is by treating the dysthymia. A combination of antidepressants and cognitive therapies <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>in</b> preventing major depressive symptoms from occurring. Additionally, exercise and good sleep hygiene (e.g., improving sleep patterns) are thought to have an additive effect on treating dysthymic symptoms and preventing them from worsening.|$|E
25|$|Affected {{individuals}} experience {{shame and}} embarrassment, fail to maintain relationships, avoid contact {{with people who}} comment on their condition, and are obsessive about masking the odour with hygiene products and even smoking. The malodorous aspect can have serious and destructive effects on schooling, personal life, career and relationships, resulting in social isolation, low self-esteem, depression, paranoid behaviour, and suicide. Delayed diagnosis, body odour {{and the lack of}} cure may lead to psychosocial issues. When the condition is suspected or known to occur in a family, genetic testing <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>in</b> identifying the specific individuals who have or carry the disorder.|$|E
25|$|Medicolegal {{forensic}} entomology covers evidence gathered through arthropod {{studies at}} the scenes of murder, suicide, rape, physical abuse and contraband trafficking. In murder investigations it deals with which insects eggs appear, their location on the body and in what order they appear. This <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>in</b> determining a post mortem interval (PMI) and location of a death in question. Since many insects exhibit a degree of endemism (occurring only in certain places), or have a well-defined phenology (active only at a certain season, or time of day), their presence in association with other evidence can demonstrate potential links to times and locations where other events may have occurred. Another area covered by medicolegal forensic entomology is the relatively new field of entomotoxicology. This particular branch involves the utilization of entomological specimens found at a scene {{in order to test}} for different drugs that may have possibly {{played a role in the}} death of the victim.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the biggest}} threats to rice, which is a staple food crop {{especially}} in India and other countries within Asia, is blast disease which is a fungal infection that causes lesions to form on {{all parts of the}} plant. A genetically engineered strain of rice has been developed so that it is resistant to blast, greatly improving the crop yield of farmers and allowing rice to be more accessible to everyone. Some other crops have been modified such that they produce higher yields per plant or that they require less land for growing. The latter <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>in</b> extreme climates with little arable land and also decreases deforestation, as fewer trees need to be cut down in order to make room for crop fields. Others yet have been altered such that they do not require the use of insecticides or fungicides. This addresses various health concerns associated with such pesticides and can also work to improve biodiversity within the area in which these crops are grown.|$|E
25|$|Traditional phonics {{instruction}} {{can also}} have the unintended consequence of promoting dysfluency. The difficulty lies in the coarticulated nature of speech; speech sounds are overlapping, while print is discrete and sequential. This can be appreciated if one shapes the mouth in position to begin to produce the word cat compared to the word cot. The initial hard c is colored by the subsequent vowel even before speech begins, i.e., the smiling position as one prepares to say cat, and the more limp position as one prepares to say cot. As early readers work from left to right, beginning with the onset consonant, they typically {{do not yet know}} the vowel with which it must be coarticulated. The vowel sound itself cannot be known until the remaining rime (the portion of the syllable beginning with the vowel and extending to its end: e.g. ight in right) is fully encountered. For these reasons, teaching reading through orientation to rime first and then adding the onset (ought-bought) <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>in</b> promoting fluency through supporting the phonological problems of coarticulation. Emphasis on the rime also supports the development of an intuitive, and therefore more fluent, awareness of orthographic patterns.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{lung disease}} {{develops}} {{in more than}} 25% of people with A-T. Three major types of lung disease can develop: (1) recurrent and chronic sinopulmonary infections; (2) lung disease caused by ineffective cough, swallowing dysfunction, and impaired airway clearance; and (3) restrictive interstitial lung disease. It is common for individuals with A-T {{to have more than}} one of these lung conditions. Chronic lung disease can occur because of recurrent lung infections due to immunodeficiency. Individuals with this problem are at risk of developing bronchiectasis, a condition in which bronchial tubes are permanently damaged, resulting in recurrent lower airway infections. Gamma globulin for people with antibody deficiency and/or chronic antibiotic treatment may reduce the problems of infection. Other individuals with A-T have difficulty with taking deep breaths and may have an ineffective cough, making it difficult to clear oral and bronchial secretions. This can lead to prolonged respiratory symptoms following common viral respiratory illnesses. Techniques that allow clearance of mucus <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>in</b> some individuals during respiratory illnesses. Some people will develop swallowing problems as they age, increasing their risk of aspiration pneumonia. Recurrent injury to the lungs caused by chronic infections or aspiration may cause lung fibrosis and scarring. This process may be enhanced by inadequate tissue repair in ATM-deficient cells. A small number of individuals develop interstitial lung disease. They have decreased pulmonary reserve, trouble breathing, a need for supplemental oxygen and chronic cough in the absence of lung infections. They may respond to systemic steroid treatment or other drugs to reduce inflammation.|$|E

500|$|The {{repeated}} {{use of the}} pomegranate in {{the symbolism}} is not accidental.

[...] Conversely, it is also a symbol of change and death. [...] This symbolism <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>in</b> identifying the deities in the reliefs. [...] The pomegranate is a suitable gift for a goddess of sexuality such as Aphrodite who herself planted the original pomegranate on Cyprus. [...] It is not a suitable gift for an intellectual goddess such as Athena. [...] The pomegranate can have an overtly sexual meaning; Demeter complains that her daughter Persophone was [...] "forced to eat the seed of a pomegranate" [...] in the underworld, by which it is understood that she was raped.|$|E
