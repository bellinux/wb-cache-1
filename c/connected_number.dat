For example quantum annealing, based on the quantum tunneling effect, has recently been shown to scale exponentially better with system size as compared with classical simulated annealing. However, current realizations of quantum annealers with superconducting qubits face two major challenges. First, the connectivity between the qubits is limited, excluding many optimization problems from a direct implementation. Second, decoherence degrades the success probability of the optimization. We address both of these shortcomings and propose an architecture in which the qubits are robustly encoded in continuous variable degrees of freedom. Remarkably, by leveraging the phenomenon of flux quantization, all-to-all connectivity is obtained without overhead. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of this architecture by simulating the optimal solution of a small instance of the NP-hard and fully <b>connected</b> <b>number</b> partitioning problem in the presence of dissipation.

40|$|Summary The spiritual {{heritage}} of Philo of Alexandria had been undertaken by Christianity and bequeathed to us. Eusebius of Caesaria (died in 340) had {{also contributed to}} it. He considered the therapeutai to be the monks of early Christianity and connected them to the community which – according to the tradition transmitted by him – was founded by Mark in Alexandria. Their ascetical way of life {{reminded him of the}} Old Testament prophets and their lack of property and their concern to philosophy reminded him of the early Christians. However he noticed that they promoted Jewish practices. Epiphanius (c. 315 – 403) adopted Eusebius’ view. He expressed his opinion that the Therapeutai originally had been called >Iessai/oi which in his view had the meaning of healers or worshippers. In De vita contemplativa (DVC) he affirms that it refers to the Essenes (Panarion XXIX. 4, 9 – 10; 5, 1). Jerome (died in 420), father of the church agrees with Eusebius’ supposition and later Mikhael of Syria, the Monophysite patriarch of Antioch follows the same line. Eusebius’ view on the Therapeute devotion defined its range for centuries. His view was nor revised until the Age of Reformation. The followers of Reformation criticized monastic order as well. The Roman Catholic Church replied by sustaining that monasticism grew out of the early Christian tradition trying to verify this tradition by the Therapeutai’s devotion based on Eusebius’ interpretation. Martinus Chemnicius and Joseph Justus Scaliger got {{to the conclusion that the}} Therapeutai’s devotion movement has to be considered a Jewish sect. Roman Catholic scholars turned against this view and its supporters and during the dispute that lasted for about three and a half centuries the critical view grew stronger. Some of the scholars even doubted Philo’s authorship (H. Grätz, Paul Ernst Lucius, E. Schürer, A. Hilgenfeld, Eduard Zeller, Abraham Kuenen, I. M. Jost, T. K. Cheyne, J. Drummond and R. F. Littledale). The study of the Therapeute issue got to a decisive turn with the publication of F. C. Conybeare’s book in 1895. It is a response to P. E. Lucius’ critical study, as Lucius relied on Eusebius’ view and on the studies that carried further his interpretation. The research work carried on by Conybeare, M. L. Massebieau and P. Wendland conclusively proved that DVC was written by Philo about 30 AD; its language, vocabulary and style are characteristic to Philo and the ideas developed here are to found in other writings of his. With the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls new possibilities have been opened for drawing a parallel between the Essene and Therapeute movements of devotion. Philo might have been in direct connection with the Therapeutai who dwelt in the neighbourhood of Alexandria and it seems that he belonged more or less to their community (De specialibus legibus III, 1 – 6). The subjectivism of DVC informs us on Philo’s being on brotherly terms with the Therapeutai dwelling by Mareotis-Lake. The description of the Therapeutai’s habitation, houses common sacred places gives the same factual impression as Philo’s writings on the Essenes. Consequently Philo’s work is based on his personal experience and we have to view the activity of the Therapeute community historically. Nevertheless it is impossible for us to draw a historical picture of the existence of the Therapeute community relying on his account. He does not inform on the time, reasons and circumstances of its appearance. He acknowledges nothing but the fact that in the first decade of the 1 st century there lived a restricted number of Therapeutai in Egypt. Referring to the su/sthma word which occurs in 75. §, Conybeare observes that the Therapeute community could function as sodalitas for which state authorization was necessary. So the Therapeute community may have been recognized either under Augustus’ or Tiberius’ reign (Conybeare, 297 – 299). In so far as it is reliable, the community must have shown a certain level of organization at the turn of our era. DVC is part of Quod omnis probus liber sit written on the Essenes of Palestine. It is striking however that the latter is a very short account. Hence we can deduce that the writing on the Essenes alluded to in DVC may have got lost. This work and DVC is supposed to have described Jewish “philosophy” for the Greek and Roman educated reader having tried to prove that the Jews did have their own philosophy and philosophical schools as well. F. C. Conybeare got to the conclusion that the subtitle of DVC Peri a>retw n to te/tarton (On Virtues. Book Four) hints at a series of books by Philo (Apologia) on virtues, namely on the order of God’s virtues (active force). In so far as DVC had been returned earlier it may have been enclosed later by Philo on the occasion of his legation to Gaius. The series of writings issued in this way may have been formed of the following books: 1. Legatio ad Gaium; 2. In Flaccum; 3. Quod omnis probus liber sit (which may have got occasionally into the series – B. Motzo); 4. De vita contemplativa (Conybeare). Scientists certainly agree that DVC and Quod omnis probus liber sit on the Essenes belong together. The two books were included in Apologia (L. Cohn, P. Wendland, L. Massebieau, N. Smirnov, F. Daumas), or in the lengthier Ioudai/wn (V. L. Ivanizki). The addition to Greek title (Peri bi/ou cewrhtikou) of the DVC (h& i<ke/thj) differs from what could have gone without saying. Why does Philo call i<ke/thj the Therapeute community? Other writings by Philo testify that the term cerapeuth/j (serving God, healer, recovering) is closely connected with i<ke/thj (beseeching, protection-searching, asking for purifying after having sinned, offering protection). This term was often used by Philo when referring to the sons of Israel, to those who were Jews by birth and for those who became Jews by adoption as well. The two concepts form a recurrent synonymous word-pair (i<ke/thj kai cerapeuthȷ) and refer to the priestly way of life, to Moses’ and Aaron’s service, to a perfect way of life pleasing God (te/leioj). This priestly way of life is the true service of God superior to everything and it means the most intimate community with God. Philo calls the community of the Therapeutai Moses’ disciples (63. §) and an order (11. §) that leads to perfect devotion. This priestly service does not match being concerned with earthly things, so priests do not have other choice than to seek shelter in God and serve Him (cf. 90. §). The concept i<ke/thj for this reason reflects the Therapeutai’s life and mission. Refugiating to God’s community they search for purification, spiritual healing. All those who are ready to leave the madding crowd are invited to join their community. The appendix entitled The “Synopsis” of Quod omnis probus liber sit 75 – 91 and DVC illustrates the similarities that occur in the description of the Essene and Therapeute communities. A parallel between the two texts at first reading reflects those issues that are consonant in the two devotion movements. They are the following: –	Representatives of perfect charity are to be found both in Palestine and Egypt. Those living in Palestine are called Essenes while those living in Egypt are called Therapeutai. The meaning of both stress that the representatives of both movements serve God above all. The Essenes do not offer sacrifice but they sacrifice themselves spiritually; the Therapeutai get spiritual healing and the gift of healing by serving God. –	Both communities are looking for and create at the same time peaceful living conditions for themselves and they form a close system. –	Both communities are in search for modesty and they consider modesty and fairness to be the utmost wealth and happiness. The Therapeutai are much more radical: they consider the good things in life and wealth to be the causes of all evil and spiritual blindness. –	There are no slaves in their communities. Descent and the earlier status do not matter. They wish to establish not only equality but also a friendly, familial and brotherly community. –	Both movements are wrapt in the Holy Scriptures – to express this by the particular term used by Philo with apologetycal and proving intention, they “philosophise”. Their remarkable devotion and their virtue are developed by “philosophy”. –	They attach special importance to the seventh day. On that day the Essenes proceed to a sacred place called synagogue, while the Therapeutai proceed to their common sacred place where they are wrapt in interpreting the Holy Scriptures by symbolic or allegorical approaches practised of old. –	There are similarities in the aim of their teaching. The Essenes try to increase the fear of God, sanctity, righteousness and they lay stress on differentiation between good and evil, indifference respectively. By lifting their eyes to God they try to increase knowledge and piety and to improve their moral charity. While searching for Scriptures both follow the principal attentively in a proper way, seating is in order of rank. –	In both sects avoiding resorting to falsehood, consistent cleanliness, perseverance, good will, destroying the longing for vain glory and sensual lust, contentedness, even-temperedness, equity, fellowship and decency are very important. –	Both sects criticize unrestrained instincts, the evil of the heathen world, deceitfulness and lie and eulogize the Essenes’ and the Therapeutai’s real freedom and their feasts showing genuine community. –	The Essenes’ and Therapeutai’s communities are the best examples of perfect and happy life (Quod omnis probus liber sit 91), that is the place of attainable, superior happiness (DVC 90). Fragments of Pro Judaeis defensio were preserved by Eusebius of Caesarea for posterity in his Praeparatio evangelica (VIII. 11, 1 – 18). Eusebius relied on Philo, who could not have been acquainted to the Essenes of Palestine. The picture drawn by him is distorted by his having viewed the Essene community as an early Christian devotion movement and because he did not distinguish between the groups accepting celibacy and those who accept marriage. Pro Judaeis defensio matches DVC in the following: –	Descendence (which marks status at the same time) is not relevant in the two communities. –	They join the community on their free will, they bind themselves for a moral life and for charity. –	Both communities are characterized by ascetic way of life, control over passion and real freedom. This means in both communities the rejecting of marriage. –	They aspire to a decent life as according to them wealth and plenty of food are maleficent for body and soul as well, they are enemies and traps. –	The members of both communities wear simple clothes. The description of both winter and summer clothes is similar. –	Their real freedom consists in rejecting profit, in abolition of slavery and in joining a cultual, brotherly community. –	Respecting each other and taking care of the old are of great importance in both communities. –	Non-members also appreciate and admire the way of life of both communities because they practise charity and philanthropy which leads to real happiness. The name Therapeutes (cerapeuth/j) refers both to service in front of God and healing. Worshipping God and healing are closely connected in Philo’s thinking, they complete each other. The therapeute way of life (healing and recovering) is closely connected with mastering passions that leads to spiritual healing. Spiritual healing needs permanent, contemplation which can be attained at a mature age (cf. DVC 2). Spiritual and moral healing does not characterize only the Therapeutai but the Essenes as well, who gain healing and real freedom in the light of God’s glory (cf. 1 QH IV, 26 – 28). Philo’s writings testify that the Therapeute way of life is linked to the priestly function. Consequently the Therapeute sect called by Philo Moses’ followers is a community of priestly character, fact which shows another similarity to the Essenes of Palestine. The Therapeutai’s ascetical piety is also characterized by renouncement to wealth. DVC does not in form on the Therapeutai’s economic activity or on supervisers responsible of goods and on cashiers. Philo’s attention is completely concentrated on presenting the meditative devotion of the community. One can imagine though that they had a supervisor responsible for the providing for food and clothing. The Therapeutai’s renouncing to wealth can be compared to the exclusive property status and common activity of the Essenes. Both are based upon the dualistic view and consequently on detaching themselves from the surrounding world. This separation has to come from one’s free will (1 QS 1, 11; DVC 13). The Therapetai avoided wealth and the rich because they considered social and economic inequality to be the cause of overthrowing God’s creation. In their view social inequity meant the “primary cause ” which generated injustice and avarice the result of which is despotism over the weak (70. §). The Cairo Damascus Document disapproves wealth in the same vehement way when it is called Belial’s ambush (CD IV, 15 – 18). The separation of the Essenes and Therapeutai, their attitude towards wealth and their asceticism can be compared best to the way of life proclaimed by Pythagorean teaching. Certain circles of Egyptian priesthood and the Stoics were also characterized by this attitude. Nevertheless these similarities do not mean that the Therapeute community is a faithful copy of the Pythagorean group (I. Levy) or that they considered the Egyptian priesthood or stoicism a primary model. The requirements of social justice are to be found in the Torah as well and the roots of asceticism can also be discovered in the Jews’ life. There is no reason to doubt that the phenomena characteristic to that age had exercised an effect on the development of the different branches on the Essene movement; they rather reminded of the Jewish roots and increased the adherence to them. The Therapeutai’s scriptural studies and meditations are called “philosophizing” by Philo because he regards the revelation of God’s word the philosophy of philosophies, the “sublime teaching on sacred wisdom” and “wisdom derived from the ancestors” (DVC 26, 28). Asceticism is the primary condition of scriptural studies and in their view philosophical studies go well with light while the needs of the flash belong to “darkness” (34 – 35 §). Accordingly spiritual sight also needs light, the presence of God’s light (11. §). This idea is also to be found in the Essenes’ thinking. In accordance with the Therapeutais’s dualist view the Sun is God’s material symbol and the embodiment of truth; darkness is the symbol of evil. Learning, knowledge and truth can only be attained in the community of God (light). The Therapeutai pray for clear-sightedness and heavenly light twice a day (27. §) i. e. they beg for light; this reminds of Gnostic contemplation (Pierre Geoltrain) the traces of which are to be found in the Essene community too (cf. eg. 1 QS II, 3). The Therapeutai’s meditation was associated with ecstasy (dream – 26. §). They have visions, they have an insight into the heavenly mysteries in the same way as the prophets of pseudoepigraph literature (Enoch, Abraham, Jacob, Levi, Esdras). As they meditate on the beauty and power of heavenly perfection and on the teachings of wisdom alone and as they search the Scriptures only on the seventh day in contrast to the Essenes, they are less interested in historical exegesis. The Peshers of Qumran on the other hand are of historical character, they are eschatological and messianistic interpretations. Philo informs us that when speaking about the Essenes they applied symbolical method of interpretation (Quod omnis probus liber sit 82.). Here we may have a wider sense of interpretation. The question is what Philo wants to express by allegory and to what extent he conforms to the educated Greek and Roman readers when speaking about it. A there is no concrete Therapeute interpretation available we cannot compare their method with that of the Essenes’. DVC 27, 66 – 67, 89 and De bello II. 8, 128 – 132 show more resemblance concerning the Therapeutai’s and the Essenes’ prayers. The Therapeutai’s morning and evening prayers can be connected not only to the Essenes’ praying time but also to the Palestinian and temple tradition. The descriptions mentioned above relate about the mass for the aurora in the two communities in the same way. The two sects are not sun worshippers. While normative Jews in Diaspora turned towards Jerusalem while praying it is possible that the two sects expressed a certain protestation by turning to the Sun. The attitude of the Essene community towards the Temple and towards official priesthood is well-known. But the question of praying in front of the rising Sun is very complex. It may be associated with the solar calendar of the Essenes (and Therapeutai) which constitutes significant dividing line between the official priesthood and the members of the sect. It is also in direct connection to the symbol-system used by the Essenes (and Therapeutai) as related to the Sun associated with God – light – life – wisdom – brightening up – justice – power of light. The Therapeutai’s ascetic devotion is characterized not only by searching the scriptures, meditation, prayer but also by singing of hymns and psalms. Hymns were composed by the principals of the community, they were those who taught the community members to sing them and they enriched the hymnal continually with new ones. The Essenes’ and Therapeutai’s psalm-singing indicates first of all the common Old Testament origin. However these religious communities had different self-identity from normative Jews and this identity required for a special psalm-poetry to be accomplished. The Therapeutai’s psalms remind us of the church psalm-tradition characterized just like the Essene hymns by responsive singing and refrains. This singing of hymns developed outside the church is due not only to the distance from the Sanctuary or to the estrangement from the priesthood but also to the prophetical preaching criticizing sacrifice. The Essenes considered their community to be like a spiritual temple and this spiritual worship is very striking in the case of the Therapeutai as well. Part of the Essenes’ thanksgiving hymns may have resounded on festive occasions, probably on the feast dedicates to the renewal of the Covenant as well. However it is certain that the Therapeutai sang their hymns at dawn on the fiftieth day. Consequently these were connected to their feast expressing joy. Their overflowing joy presents similarities with the atmosphere of sacral feasts in the Qumran community. In the Essene table society one could feel the foretaste of the future Messianic feast (1 Q 28 a II, 11 – 22). The nocturnal feast of the Therapeutai associated with singing and cultic dance was a new dash of colour as compared to the Essenes’. This practice shows similarities with the mystery religions (M. M. Jelizarova). The Therapeutai’s feasts on the seventh day are based on Jewish tradition. This is supported by the existence of the “commom sacred place” which was a kind of “synagogue” and dining-room at the same time just like in the case of the Essenes of Qumran. The fence dividing men and women is also characteristic for synagogues, that is they remind of the church tradition. Their Sabbath has the same importance as in the Essene communities. It was on that day that they gave up their fasting and self-restraint. Asceticism having served spiritual healing in laying aside abstinence and is dining together they could foretaste complete healing. The seventh day feast had been looked upon by the Therapeutai as “sacred and intact forever” (65. §). They <b>connected</b> <b>number</b> seven to the Pythagorean numerology. In this way their Sabbath receives a Hellenistic foundation and universal character at the same time (cf. De opificio mundi 89). If the Therapeutai accorded to Sabbath such an importance we have to consider them to the community of Jewish character which was opened to the Hellenistic word ready to join them. Most of the scientists adopt the view that the Essenes’ feast had sacral character and that they replaced the church feast connected to offering a sacrifice. The Therapeuthai community on Mareia-lakeside considered by Philo to be “the most admirable” can be compared above all to the Essenes of Qumran. On this site there lived women who took a vow of chastity, who led the same way of life as men. This phenomenon proves that the Hellenistic entourage accepted feminine perfection if women disdained the pleasures of the flesh and they assumed chastity not only of their free will but also due to their devotion to wisdom, so they “gave birth” not to mortals but to spiritual successors: spiritual and immortal fruit yielded by God’s beloved servant (68. §). Engagement to God, that is chastity offered to God was not strange to Jewish mysticists. This mysterious union was possible not for men exclusively. We read in Philo’s De cherubim that Sarah, Lea, Rebecca and Zipporah also shared in this and therefore they can be considered chaste again (40 – 52). This community having monastic character on the Mareotis-lakeside, the site of “the most admirable” raised the scale of genuine devotion not only to celibacy but it also founded the institution of women chastity. The Essenes and the Therapeutai wore t...|$|E

Chapter 1 tests the proposal that adults <b>connect</b> <b>number</b> language to nonverbal number representations via two learning mechanisms : Associative Mapping and Structure Mapping. Associative Mapping {{in this context is}} an item-by-item linking of particular number words to particular nonverbal representations of number (e. g., by connecting the word twenty to nonverbal representations of ̀about 20 things'). In contrast, Structure Mapping is a holistic inference about the relation between two systems - in this case, the verbal and nonverbal number systems. Data from four tasks provide evidence that adults rely on Associative Mappings for number words up to about 12, and Structure Mapping for larger number words. This suggests that multiple learning mechanisms aid in <b>connecting</b> <b>number</b> language to the numerical content that it represents. Chapter 2 tests {{the development of}} children's reliance on Associative Mapping and Structure Mapping when <b>connecting</b> <b>number</b> language to nonverbal representations of number. Do children initially rely primarily on Associative Mapping, Structure Mapping, or a combination of the two? What types of changes occur over time to children's mappings? These data show that children rely on Associative Mappings for numbers up to about 6, and Structure Mapping for larger numbers. This suggests that (a) inferential processes like those underlying Structure Mapping are essential to even children's earliest estimation abilities and (b) developmental changes to estimation ability in early development cannot be accounted for by improvements to Associative Mappings. Chapter 3 extends the finding that children rely on Structure Mapping to <b>connect</b> <b>number</b> language to nonverbal representations of number by asking about the types of structural inferences that children make when <b>connecting</b> <b>number</b> language to nonverbal quantity representations.

40|$|Abstract: Recently {{the concept}} of triple {{connected}} graphs with real life application was introduced in [14] by considering {{the existence of a}} path containing any three vertices of a graph G. In [3], G. Mahadevan et. al., introduced triple <b>connected</b> domination <b>number</b> of a graph. Also in[10], the authors introduced {{the concept of}} strong triple <b>connected</b> domination <b>number</b> of a graph. A subset S of V of a nontrivial graph G is said to be triple connected dominating set, if S is a dominating set and the induced sub graph is triple connected. The minimum cardinality taken over all triple connected dominating sets is called the triple <b>connected</b> domination <b>number</b> and is denoted b...|$|R

The TMT assessed processing speed, executive function (i.e. mental flexibility), and visual scanning ability and involved two parts. In Part A, the participant had to <b>connect</b> <b>numbers</b> in ascending order (from 1 to 25) as fast as possible. In Part B, the participant had to <b>connect</b> <b>numbers</b> (from 1 to 13) and letters (from A to L) in ascending or alphabetic order and alternate a number and a letter (1 -A- 2 -B- 3 -C, etc.) as fast as possible. The dependent variables were the time per transition {{and the number of}} correct transitions for each part, and the number of perseverations (when the participant failed to alternate numbers and letters) for Part B. The DSST assessed psychomotor processing speed. This test involved a grid with digits from 1 to 9 and their corresponding symbols, and below, a grid with only the digits. The participant had to fill the grid with the associated symbols, in 90  s, as fast as possible. The dependent variables were the number of correct symbols and the number of errors.|$|R
