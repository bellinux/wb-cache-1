40|$|We {{present results}} of {{electronic}} structure calculations for aluminium contacts of atomic size, based on density functional {{theory and the}} local density approximation. Addressing the atomic orbitals at {{the neck of the}} nanocontact, we find that the local band structure deviates strongly from bulk fcc aluminium. In particular, hybridization between Al 3 s and 3 p states is fully suppressed due to directed bonds at the contact. Moreover, a charge transfer of 0. 6 electrons off the <b>contact</b> <b>aluminium</b> site is found. Both the suppressed hybridization and the violated charge neutrality are characteristic features of metallic nanocontacts. This fact has serious consequences for models aiming at a microscopic description of transport properties. Comment: 6 pages, 3 figures, accepted by Chemical Physics Letter...|$|E

40|$|Background: Traditionally, <b>contact</b> allergy to <b>aluminium</b> {{has been}} {{established}} by patch testing with aluminium chloride hexahydrate in petrolatum at 2. 0 % and an empty Finn Chamber®. Objectives: The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate different aluminium test preparations regarding an optimal compound and an optimal test concentration. Methods. Six different aluminium compounds and an empty Finn Chamber® were used to patch test 21 patients with <b>aluminium</b> <b>contact</b> allergy. <b>Aluminium</b> chloride hexahydrate in saline was used for intracutaneous injection of 19 patients. Results: One test preparation, aluminium lactate 2. 4 %, was found to show significantly more positive patch test reactions than aluminium chloride hexahydrate 2. 0 % (p = 0. 03). Aluminium chloride hexahydrate at 10. 0 % pet. gave the highest number of positive reactions to aluminium [14 / 21 (67 %) ]. No positive reactions were noted to an empty Finn Chamber®, and 3 of 19 (16 %) patients reacted positively to the intradermal test. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that patch testing with aluminium chloride hexahydrate 2. 0 %, with an empty Finn Chamber® and the intradermal test with the salt and doses used are insufficient methods to detect <b>contact</b> allergy to <b>aluminium.</b> Aluminium chloride hexahydrate at 10. 0 % gave the highest number of positive reactions to aluminium...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} {{presented}} in this thesis was to investigate {{two different types of}} adverse reactions, persistent itching nodules and <b>contact</b> allergy to <b>aluminium,</b> after immunization with aluminium-containing vaccines and aluminium-containing allergen extracts used for allergen-specific immunotherapy (ASIT). The first paper describes active parental reporting of adverse events (AEFIs) after a booster dose of diphtheria-tetanus vaccine (DT). A parental questionnaire elicited reports of AEFIs within seven days of vaccination. A follow-up phone call was made in all cases of positive response. Active surveillance by parental reports was shown to be a useful complement to passive surveillance of childhood immunization. The proportion of late local reactions after immunization with a fourth dose of DT vaccines containing different aluminium compounds as adjuvant was investigated in the second study, in which a prospective cluster-randomized, active surveillance study was performed in 25, 232 10 -year-olds. Parental reports were collected 6 months after vaccination. 3 - 6 children per 10, 000 had a persistent itching nodule. <b>Contact</b> allergy to <b>aluminium</b> was not detected. These findings support the continued use of the vaccine presently offered in the Swedish vaccination programme. However, continued surveillance is warranted. The study described in the third paper examined retrospectively whether ASIT could induce <b>contact</b> allergy to <b>aluminium,</b> and investigated a possible association between persistent subcutaneous nodules and aluminium allergy. The study consisted of a non-clinical part based on a questionnaire, and a clinical part involving a physical examination, self-assessment of itching, and patch testing. A statistically significant association was found between <b>contact</b> allergy to <b>aluminium</b> and persistent subcutaneous nodules in children given ASIT. Contact allergy was found in eight of the participants, all given ASIT. The fourth paper presents the results of a prospective study on whether ASIT with allergen preparations containing <b>aluminium</b> hydroxide induces <b>contact</b> allergy to <b>aluminium.</b> The association between <b>contact</b> allergy to <b>aluminium</b> and persistent itching nodules was also studied. Three groups undergoing ASIT were patch tested with aluminium chloride hexahydrate before and during ASIT. A control group was included (untreated).

It has been pointed out that positive patch test reactions to aluminium may not be reproducible on retesting.

Methods: Twenty-one adults, who had previously reacted positively to aluminium, were patch tested with equimolar dilution series in pet. of aluminium chloride hexahydrate and aluminium lactate, four times {{over a period of}} 8 months. Results: Thirty-six of 84 (43 %) serial dilution tests with aluminium chloride hexahydrate and 49 of 84 (58 %) serial dilution tests with aluminium lactate gave negative results. The range of reactivity varied between a negative reaction to aluminium chloride hexahydrate at 10 % and/or to aluminium lactate at 12 %, and a positive reaction to aluminium chloride hexahydrate at 0. 1 % and/or to aluminium lactate at 0. 12 %. The highest individual difference in test reactivity noticed was 320 -fold when the two most divergent minimal eliciting concentrations were compared. Conclusions: The patch test reactivity to aluminium varies over time. Aluminium-allergic individuals may have false-negative reactions.
