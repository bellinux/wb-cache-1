50|$|Willy Gardner, {{an amiable}} man, {{operates}} a run-down hotel called the Winchester. One day, {{as he makes}} his rounds rousing the guests at noon for <b>check-out</b> <b>time,</b> he comes across an open door to room 303. In the room, Willy finds a trunk. He opens it and finds it empty. He makes an off-hand remark about wishing he had a nickel for every time he found a piece of luggage someone left behind. He closes it and attempts to move it but it has become too heavy. Willy opens it again to find the trunk filled with nickels.|$|E
50|$|Check {{in times}} vary but this {{can range from}} 12pm until about 3pm {{depending}} on the establishment's rules and regulations. Late check-ins can be arranged through the hotel {{as long as the}} guests book this in advance and arrange all the necessary details. Hotels usually specify a check-in time after which they expect guests to check-in. If a guest wants to occupy a hotel room before the hotel's check-in time, some hotels charges for an additional day or treat it as a previous day's stay (as compared to occupying the hotel room after the check-in time). Most hotels, however, allow a grace time (typically 30-60 minutes) on request by a guest, without any additional charge, if a guest wishes to take the room before the check-in time. Some hotels also have a latest check-in time, often 6pm-8pm, after which they may give a room to someone else if the room is not prepaid or the guest does not phone in to indicate a time of arrival. Some hotels have a deadline for checking-in because the reception may close for the night. For the most cost-effective usage of hotel room occupancy, a guest should try to reach at about hotel's check-in time and leave or hand over the hotel room at about the hotel's <b>check-out</b> <b>time,</b> {{but it may not be}} always practical because the guest's arrival and departure time of flights or car trips may not align with the hotel check-in and <b>check-out</b> <b>time</b> and for other reasons.|$|E

The 8500 square-foot library is located on Garstin Drive near the southern shore of Big Bear Lake and offers books, videos, CDs, DVDs, audio books, e-books, computers, and internet access for patrons. The library was remodeled in 2009, which included additional public computers and a new circulation desk that allows for self <b>check-out.</b> Story <b>times</b> for younger children, teen programs, donated book sales, and special events are also held at the library.|$|R
40|$|With the {{introduction}} of the chipcardfor public transport (OV-chipkaart) as a digital ticketing system in the Dutch public transport (PT), a new data source for PT was created. The data registered by this smartcard contain every transaction (check-ins and <b>check-outs)</b> with according <b>time</b> and location. In 2013, the OV-chipkaart system operator Trans Link Systems registered 1. 9 billion transactions, which were allstored in the central back office(Trans Link Systems, 2014). This Big Data 1 source contains interesting information for strategic transport models using a pivot point method(Pelletier, Trépanier, & Morency, 2011). This method uses origin-destination (OD) matrices to describe the current situation, on which growth factors are applied to determine forecast matrices. The OV-chipkaart replaced the National Ticketing System (NVB),with the according WROOV studies. The NVB contained themain ticket types and allowed travellers to travel with all PT operators in the country. The WROOV studies consisted of surveys that were used to allocate the revenues of the NVB to the operators and governments. The WROOV surveys were the primary data source of travel behaviour regarding bus and light rail until 2009, the year the OV-chipkaart was introduced. The data availability on travel behaviour {{was one of the reasons}} for PT operators to introduce the OV-chipkaart(Bergmans, Bottenberg, & Hilferink, 2012). In contradiction to WROOV data, however, the OV-chipkaart data havehardlybeen used in strategic planning. This is caused byseveral issues: the availability of OV-chipkaart data is deficient and, moreover, the OV-chipkaart data do not contain all required information(Bagchi & White, 2005) ...|$|R

40|$|A FLEXIBLE PAYMENT SCHEME IN HOTEL BUSINESS by Ciwei DONG This paper {{introduces}} a flexible payment scheme {{in the hotel}} business. When a customer makes a reservation for a hotel room, the hotel offers an optional payment scheme (Scheme O). If the customer chooses the Scheme O, he/she makes a non-refundable down payment immediately. Meanwhile, the hotel offers a discount if the customer actually checks in to the hotel. Thus, the payment at <b>check-out</b> <b>time</b> is {{much lower than the}} original rental rate. Alternatively, if the customer rejects the Scheme O, the reservation is made under a traditional Scheme (Scheme T), where no down payment is required. However, the customer choosing Scheme T must make a full payment without any discount when he checks out from the hotel. The value of Scheme O depends on customers ’ cancelation or no-show due to the competition from nearby hotels. We consider two scenarios: 1). the hotel knows the expected value of competitor’s rental rate (deterministic case); 2). the hotel knows the stochasti...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{design of}} a cost {{effective}} RF based attendance and access control system for office use is presented. The design utilizes a low cost and readily available wireless door bell for wireless transmission of user information. The user module consists of an AT 89 C 52 microcontroller which transmits different codes using transmitter section of door bell corresponding to various push buttons for attendance and access control purposes. The receiver section of door bell is also interfaced to AT 89 C 52 microcontroller which recognizes the code and passes it to central computer through serial port interface. Computer software developed using Visual Basic keeps record of check-in and <b>check-out</b> <b>time</b> of employees and calculates the salary accordingly. In case if the transmitter is lost, the employee is required to inform the central station {{with the help of}} a mobile or through emergency device installed at central station for prevention of possible misuse and theft detection.

40|$|The {{level of}} service is an {{important}} aspect of the operation and management at a railway passenger station. Particularly, the {{level of service}} in waiting room (LOSWR) {{is one of the most}} important influential factors in deciding passengers’ satisfaction. This paper proposes a model for finding the LOSWR based on the maximum number of passengers, and an Arena simulation model that simulates passengers’ aggregation behaviors in the waiting room is presented for analyzing the LOSWR. Through the simulation, we demonstrate how the passenger advanced arrival time and the accompany rate influence the maximum number of passengers and the LOSWR. In addition, the simulation also illustrates the effect utilities and the priority of different measures that can be used to improve the LOSWR. In detail, the simulation results demonstrate that the passenger advanced arrival time and advanced <b>check-out</b> <b>time</b> have much stronger effect utilities on the maximum number of passengers and the LOSWR than other discussed factors. The simulation suggests that the Arena is an effective simulation platform for analyzing complex passengers-related behaviors at railway passenger station...|$|E

40|$|This study {{attempts}} to measure relationship between service quality and value towards customers’ satisfaction on hospitality service in Malaysian Armed Forces using {{a modified version}} of the LODGSERV and SERVQUAL instrument (Parasuraman, Zeithaml and Berry, 1988). All five dimensions of service quality, being tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy, will be used. The questionnaire survey will be conducted on a two-week period during <b>check-out</b> <b>time</b> at banquet hall and dinnertime at dining hall Wisma Transit Kuala Lumpur. All customers who check-out before departure to Sabah & Sarawak will assemble at banquet hall. The Cronboch Coefficient Alpha will be used to test the construct reliability. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to determine the relationship between service quality and value towards customers’ perceived service quality for five dimensions on hospitality service at Wisma Transit and different groups of loyalty. In addition, correlation analysis will be used to determine the relationship between customers’ perceived service quality and customers’ characteristics such as gender, marital status, age, and reasons for staying. The results of this study will asssist Wisma Transit management to assess the service quality provided to its patrons. Results of this study will also help Wisma Transit management establish a total quality management (TQM) program to improve overall service quality to its patrons...|$|E
