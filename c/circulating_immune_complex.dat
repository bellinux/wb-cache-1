40|$|Since mucosal immune {{response}} involving IgA {{may be particularly}} important in the pathogenesis of gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE), we examined the sera of 22 patients with GSE for IgA-containing <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> using a sensitive radioimmunoassay, the Raji cell assay for IgA-containing <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes.</b> The Raji cell assay for IgG-containing <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> and the 125 I-C 1 q-binding assay were also used to measure IgG- or IgM-containing <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> in these patients. Ten of 22 (45 %) patients had IgA-containing <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes,</b> while 11 of 22 (50 %) had IgG- or IgM-containing <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes.</b> Thirteen of 22 (59 %) patients had <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> detected {{by at least one}} of the assays used. Neither the presence nor level of <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> correlated with disease activity in any of the patients studied. Five patients, whose disease was well controlled on a gluten-free diet, were studied serially during dietary challenge with gluten. It was found that IgA-containing <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> did not develop or increase in amount in the serum of these patients despite the induction of gastrointestinal symptoms. In addition, no significant change in IgG- or IgM- containing <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> occurred in any of the challenged patients. No significant abnormalities of serum complement levels (C 3, C 4, factor B) were detected in any of the patients including those challenged with gluten. Sucrose density-gradient ultracentrifugation studies revealed that the IgA-containing <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> had sedimentation characteristics between 9 S and 13 S. The presence of <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> in only 59 % of patients with GSE, their lack of correlation with disease activity, and their failure to change during dietary gluten challenge suggests that <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> do not play a primary role in the pathogenesis of GSE...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] <b>Circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> can be {{elevated}} in serum {{samples of}} patients with sarcoidosis and are associated with disease activity, but their diagnostic significance is not understood. METHODS [...] The different classes of <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> containing immunoglobulin A, G, or M, {{and the content of}} complement in <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> (polyethylene glycol precipitation) as well as levels of complement binding <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> (complement binding assay) were determined in 19 patients with active, untreated pulmonary sarcoidosis. The results were compared with other parameters in the serum (soluble interleukin 2 receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme, immunoglobulin A, G, and M) and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (lymphocytes, helper cells, suppressor cells, activated T cells), and with radiological stage and functional parameters (FEV 1, vital capacity, total lung capacity, transfer coefficient (KCO), and the alveolar-arterial oxygen difference during exercise). RESULTS [...] In all patients <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> could be detected by polyethylene glycol precipitation and were similar to control subjects. The content of C 1 q in <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> was higher than in controls, yet in {{all but one of the}} cases was still within normal limits. In contrast, elevated levels of complement binding <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> were found in 67 % of the patients. No correlation was seen between <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> and any of the other parameters in the serum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or lung function values. No differences were found between radiological type I and II presentations of sarcoidosis. CONCLUSIONS [...] The complement binding assay showed a much higher sensitivity for the detection of <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> in active pulmonary sarcoidosis than the polyethylene glycol precipitation method. As there was no correlation between levels of <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> and other parameters of the disease they are probably not useful for the assessment of disease activity...|$|R
40|$|In human renal allografts, {{recipients}} {{respond with}} various specific immune reactions, {{such as the}} production of <b>immune</b> <b>complexes.</b> The <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> provoke damage of the grafted kidney under the appropriate condition. Therefore, the detection of <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> is important in predicting the rejection of grafted kidneys.

However, the pathogenic relationship between wheat products {{and the skin}} disease is poorly understood. The present {{study was designed to}} assess the short-term response of IgA and IgG circulating immune complexes to oral ingestion of wheat and nonwheat dietary protein. Five patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and 5 normal controls were fed whole wheat and serum was collected every 30 mm. After 5 hr, a gluten-free meal was given and serum was collected hourly for 5 more hours. IgA circulating immune complexes and IgG circulating immune complexes were measured using the Raji cell immunoradiometric assay. Patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, as a group, developed a significant elevation of IgA <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complex</b> levels, but not IgG <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complex</b> levels, after wheat ingestion. Normals, as a group, failed to develop a significant elevation of (either IgA or IgG circulating immune complexes after wheat ingestion. Induction of IgA circulating immune complexes was demonstrated in 5 of 5 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, including 2 patients with previously normal levels of IgA circulating immune complexes. These results indicate that: (1) elevation of igA circulating immune complexes can be induced in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis with previously normal levels, (2) IgA <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complex</b> levels are related to a factor known to alter disease activity, namely wheat ingestion, and (3) the immune complex response is characteristic for IgA in a disease felt to be IgA mediated.

40|$|Purpose: To Study {{immune status}} in {{patients}} with coxarthrosis consequent to treatment of congenital hip dysplasia and Perthes' disease {{as well as to}} determine additional variables indicating arthrosis progression. Materials and methods: The authors analyzed results of preoperative immune examination of 13 male patients aged 11, 4 ± 0, 7 years (10 - 13) with coxarthrosis of type I-II developed consequently to treatment of hip dysplasia and Perthes' disease. Based on obtained anatomical and functional outcomes the authors divided the patients into two groups. First group included 8 patients with postoperative improvement of joint function and absence of disease progression. Second group (5 patients) was featured by functional deterioration and arthrosis advancing.

Patients and methodsCirculating immune complexes were analyzed from blood samples of 20 postpolio patients and 95 healthy controls. To compensate for differences in age between patients and controls, a sub-analysis was performed using only the 30 oldest controls.

40|$|<b>Circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> {{were found}} in 15 of 16 {{patients}} with fulminant hepatic failure due to viral hepatitis and all of six patients who had had halothane anaesthesia; however, they {{were found in}} only five of 32 patients with paracetamol-induced hepatic necrosis. The levels of <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> were {{not related to the}} severity of the clinical course, development of renal failure, final outcome, or severity of hypocomplementaemia. All the patients had depressed reticuloendothelial function as assessed by the clearance of 125 I microaggregated albumin. These findings show that <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> in fulminant hepatic failure are not simply a reflection of an immune response to liver antigens released {{as a result of the}} hepatic necrosis; nor are they a reflection of the failure of the reticuloendothelial system. This supports the view that <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> are associated with immune mediated liver injury and may contribute to the process...|$|R
40|$|A case of {{transient}} {{nephrotic syndrome}} caused by secondary syphilis is described. A renal biopsy was performed revealing subepithelial hump-like electron-dense deposits and fusion of epithelial foot-processes. Complement C 1 q-binding-activity and anticomplementarity were {{demonstrated in the}} blood, indicating the presence of <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes.</b> This strongly suggests that <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> are significant in the immunopathogenesis of syphilitic nephropathy...|$|R
