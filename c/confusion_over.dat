5|$|Prior to 1945 (when Pius XII {{changed the}} form of ballot to use {{anonymous}} oaths, first carried out in 1958), the sealing wax on the complex type ballots illustrated above {{had the effect of}} making the smoke from burning the ballots either black or white, depending on whether or not damp straw was added. Until the 20th century, sealing wax customarily had beeswax mixed into its composition. The use of wax made solely from animal fat does not give as much white colored smoke, as does wax that includes beeswax. In the 1939 conclave there was some <b>confusion</b> <b>over</b> the smoke color, which was even more apparent in the 1958 conclave. This explains the <b>confusion</b> <b>over</b> the color of the smoke in the 1958 Papal conclave, caused by the lack of sealing wax on the ballots. The Siri thesis was based on the <b>confusion</b> <b>over</b> the smoke color {{on the first day of}} that conclave.|$|E
5|$|Manning's lawyers {{argued that}} the {{government}} had overstated the harm the release of the documents had caused, and had overcharged Manning to force her to give evidence against Assange. The defense also raised questions about whether Manning's <b>confusion</b> <b>over</b> her gender identity affected her behavior and decision making.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} <b>confusion</b> <b>over</b> which {{scientific}} name {{to use for}} over two hundred years. Tricholoma tigrinum {{has been used in}} some European field guides, but has been applied in error to this species. The uncertainty was such that Czech mycologists Josef Herink and František Kotlaba suggested in 1967 that both designations were incorrect, and proposed the new name T.pardalotum.|$|E

5000|$|Definitions {{and uses}} of the words holobiont and hologenome also differ between proponents and skeptics, and the misuse of the terms has led to <b>confusions</b> <b>over</b> what {{comprises}} evidence related to the hologenome. Ongoing discourse is attempting to clear this confusion. Theis et al. clarify that [...] "critiquing the hologenome concept is not synonymous with critiquing coevolution, and arguing that an entity is not a primary unit of selection dismisses {{the fact that the}} hologenome concept has always embraced multilevel selection." ...|$|R

No official release {{announcement was made}} even on the band's official website. Downloads from iTunes and Amazon were removed after there was <b>confusion</b> <b>over</b> the band's name. The new band name, Skysaw, was officially announced in December 2010.|$|E
5|$|After {{his release}} from prison in 2010, Chen was placed under house arrest against Chinese law, and was closely {{monitored}} by security forces. Legally, he was proclaimed {{by the government to}} be a free man, but in reality the local government offered no explanation for the hundreds of unidentified agents monitoring his house and preventing visitors or escape. The national propaganda organ, the Global Times, expressed <b>confusion</b> <b>over</b> the issue, and suggested that the local government may not know how to handle it, but no disciplinary action was taken at the national level.|$|E
5|$|BOAC Flight 712 (callsign Speedbird 712) was a British Overseas Airways Corporation service {{operated}} by a Boeing 707-465 from London Heathrow Airport bound for Sydney via Zurich and Singapore. On Monday 8 April 1968, it suffered an engine failure on takeoff that quickly led to a major fire. The engine fell off the aircraft in flight. After the aircraft had made a successful emergency landing, <b>confusion</b> <b>over</b> checklists and distractions from {{the presence of a}} check captain contributed to the deaths of five of the 127 on board.|$|E

5|$|In 1963, the Washington State Legislature {{commissioned}} {{a new state}} highway numbering system to ease <b>confusion</b> <b>over</b> similarly-numbered routes. The new system debuted in 1964, assigning State Route522 (SR522) to the Seattle–Bothell–North Bend highway, and State Route202 (SR202) to a proposed branch of the Stevens Pass Highway between Monroe and Bothell. By 1970, SR522 {{was moved to the}} completed Bothell–Monroe highway, retaining the Seattle–Bothell portion, while SR202 was designated to the remaining highway from Woodinville (east of Bothell) to North Bend.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Jenna {{gets into}} trouble after she is misquoted in Maxim magazine, {{allegedly}} {{saying that she}} hates the troops. This happened due to Jenna mishearing the interviewer and thinking he meant theater troupes. The resulting outrage prompts Jack to get her an interview on Hardball with Chris Matthews to clear up the <b>confusion</b> <b>over</b> her comments. During the interview, Jenna confuses Osama bin Laden and then-Senator Barack Obama, who was running for the Democratic Party nomination for President. A further attempt to clear Jenna's name backfires when swastikas are accidentally brandished on the TGS with Tracy Jordan stage.|$|E

5000|$|Les Nicandres, ou Les Menteurs qui ne mentent point (English: The Nicandres, or The Liars {{who do not}} lie, 1664). A comedy. A {{play about}} two {{identical}} twin brothers, who also use the same name: [...] "Nicandre" [...] (Nicander). There are constant <b>confusions</b> <b>over</b> their identities, and [...] "ludicrous mistakes and misunderstandings" [...] result {{from the fact that}} their own mistresses and valets can not tell them apart. The plot and its humor are similar, though not identical, to Menaechmi by Plautus. John Colin Dunlop lists it among several French imitations of the ancient play, noting that the earliest among them was a 1630s version by Jean Rotrou.|$|R
25|$|An even broader <b>confusion</b> arose <b>over</b> the {{numbering}} of {{the piano}} sonatas, with numbering systems ranging from 15 to 23 sonatas, although numbers are used far more often for the symphonies than for the piano sonatas of Schubert.|$|R

During their {{conversation}} Ste reveales Amy was the only girl he really had feelings for and that his <b>confusion</b> <b>over</b> his sexuality was not the reason for him abusing her during their relation ship. Ste is very relieved by Amy's good reaction. Amy {{is the one who}} discovers that Brendan is hitting Ste and she tells Ste to break it off, reminding him of how it was when he was hitting her.|$|E
5|$|The {{large number}} of goals created a <b>confusion</b> <b>over</b> the correct scoreline. At {{the end of the}} match, the {{scoreboard}} at the stadium showed 32–0 and Thompson was credited with 14 goals. After the statistician did a recount, the 31–0 scoreline was announced, and Thompson's total goals count was reduced to 13. After the match, FIFA went on to release the official statistics after receiving the official report from the referee and match officials, which confirmed the 31–0 scoreline and Thompson's 13 goals.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{casualties}} of the sinking is unclear, due {{to a number of}} factors, including <b>confusion</b> <b>over</b> the passenger list, which included some names of people who cancelled their trip at the last minute, and the fact that several passengers travelled under aliases for various reasons and were double-counted on the casualty lists. The death toll has been put at between 1,490 and 1,635people. The figures below are from the British Board of Trade report on the disaster.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>confusion</b> exists <b>over</b> which {{locomotive}} actually {{carried the}} name Doctor Syn at any particular time. If the real Doctor Syn {{was out of}} service for any reason Howey often had its nameplates switched onto the other Canadian outline locomotive.|$|R
50|$|Daylight saving {{time was}} {{introduced}} by the Summer Time Act 1916 (6 & 7 Geo. V), which was implemented in 1916 as GMT plus one hour and Dublin Mean Time plus one hour. The length of DST could be extended by Order in Council, and was extended {{for the duration of}} World War I. For 1916, DST extended from 21 May to 1 October, with transitions at 02:00 standard time. On 1 October 1916, Greenwich Mean Time was introduced to Ireland. At the beginning of the 20th century, Sandringham Time (UTC+00:30) was used by the royal household. This practice was halted by King Edward VIII, in an effort to reduce <b>confusions</b> <b>over</b> time.|$|R

5|$|There is some <b>confusion</b> <b>over</b> {{the number}} and name of ships {{that were part of}} the Reşadiye class. Some sources report Reşadiye and Mehmed Reşad V as having been {{different}} ships; these were in fact the same vessel, ordered originally under the latter name. Similarly, Fatih Sultan Mehmed is sometimes listed as Fatik or Fatih. Another ship, Reshad-i Hammiss, is sometimes reported to have been ordered in 1911 and cancelled in 1912, though according to Bernd Langensiepen and Ahmet Güleryüz in their authoritative The Ottoman Steam Navy, the Ottomans initially only had ordered one vessel.|$|E

5|$|Translation {{problems}} are {{compounded by the}} women's <b>confusion</b> <b>over</b> which type of FGM they experienced, or even whether they experienced it. Several {{studies have suggested that}} survey responses are unreliable. A 2003 study in Ghana found that in 1995 four percent said they had not undergone FGM, but in 2000 said they had, while 11 percent switched in the other direction. In Tanzania in 2005, 66 percent reported FGM, but a medical exam found that 73 percent had undergone it. In Sudan in 2006, a significant percentage of infibulated women and girls reported a less severe type.|$|E

5|$|Attendances {{continued}} to increase during {{the remainder of the}} 1900s, as 121,452 saw the 1908 Scotland v England match. The two Old Firm matches played for the 1909 Scottish Cup Final attracted a total of 131,000. After the second match there was a riot because there was <b>confusion</b> <b>over</b> what would happen next when the second match also ended in a draw. The fans believed that the replay would be played to a conclusion and demanded that a period of extra time be played. The Scottish Cup trophy was withheld as Hampden was not in a fit condition to host a second replay. In response to the riot, the Scottish Football Association decided not to use Hampden as the Scottish Cup Final venue until after the First World War.|$|E
5|$|Chad is {{a member}} of the Crane family. The illegitimate son of the evil patriarch Alistair Crane, Chad is {{introduced}} as a music producer from Los Angeles who is searching for his biological family. Chad becomes involved in a love triangle with sisters Whitney and Simone Russell. His romance with Whitney is complicated by the possibility they may be engaging in an incestuous relationship as Chad is initially believed to be her half-brother, and later revealed to be her adoptive cousin. Chad's later storylines focus on his <b>confusion</b> <b>over</b> his sexual identity, and his sexual relationship with tabloid reporter Vincent Clarkson. Chad attempts to reconcile with Whitney, after his affair with Vincent is revealed, before being killed by his father Alistair while trying to protect his best friend, Ethan Winthrop.|$|E
5|$|<b>Confusion</b> <b>over</b> the {{colouration}} of the Mascarene parrot {{has also}} been furthered by a plate by French engraver and naturalist François-Nicolas Martinet in Buffon's 1779 Histoire Naturelle Des Oiseaux, the first coloured illustration of this species. It shows the bird as brown with a purplish head, {{and the strength of}} these colours differs considerably between copies, a result of having been hand-coloured by many different artists who worked under Martinet in his workshop. Across these copies, the body ranges from chestnut brown to greyish chocolate, the tail from light grey to blackish grey-brown, and the head from bluish grey to dove-grey. The plate also lacks two dark central tail feathers without white bases, a feature described by Brisson, and these features have been repeated by subsequent artists. Martinet's illustration and Buffon's description were perhaps based on the Paris specimen.|$|E

5000|$|Despite the British, Australian and Canadian {{versions}} of the FAL being manufactured using machine tools which utilised the Imperial measurement system, they are all of the same basic dimensions. Parts incompatibilities between the original FAL and the L1A1 are due to pattern differences, not due to the different dimensions. <b>Confusions</b> <b>over</b> the differences {{has given rise to}} the terminology of [...] "metric" [...] and [...] "inch" [...] FAL rifles, which originated as a reference to the machine tools which produced them. Despite this, virtually all FAL rifles are of the same basic dimensions, true to the original Belgian FN FAL. In the US, the term [...] "metric FAL" [...] refers to guns of the Belgian FAL pattern, whereas [...] "inch FAL" [...] refers to ones produced to the Commonwealth L1A1/C1 pattern.|$|R
