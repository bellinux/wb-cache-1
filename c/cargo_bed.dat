25|$|In October 2017, Hanwha {{unveiled}} an internally-funded upgrade {{project that}} would turn the K200 into a modular, multi-purpose vehicle. The design involves stretching the chassis and adding a road wheel for six pairs and removing the back section to create a flat <b>cargo</b> <b>bed</b> to fit various modules that can be swapped out for different missions; initial configurations include modules {{to act as an}} ambulance, fuel tanker, minelayer, and communications platform. With ROK Army approval, the company could fully mature the project in two years.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{generation}} Ridgeline has a [...] <b>cargo</b> <b>bed</b> {{which can be}} extended to [...] with the tailgate down. [...] The bed's width between the wheel-wells is [...] and [...] at its widest points. [...] The Ridgeline's drivetrain, frame, and suspension design allowed engineers to build the [...] "industry's first" [...] lockable, watertight, and drainable [...] In-Bed Trunk {{at the rear of}} the bed. [...] The cabin can accommodate five full-size adults with [...] of under-seat storage in the second row or [...] when the rear 60/40 split bench seat's bottom cushions are folded up. [...] It has [...] of ground clearance with approach, departure and breakover angles of 24.5º, 22º, and 21º respectively while maintaining a comfortable entry/exit height for passengers.|$|E

50|$|Trucks. The Palletized Load System (PLS) {{is based}} around two {{variants}} of prime mover truck (M1074 and M1075) fitted with an integral self-loading and unloading capability, a trailer (M1076), and demountable <b>cargo</b> <b>beds,</b> {{referred to as}} flatracks. The PLS prime mover truck carries its payloads on its demountable flatrack <b>cargo</b> <b>beds,</b> or inside 8×8×20 foot International Organization for Standardization (ISO) intermodal containers, or shelters. The M1074 {{is equipped with a}} variable reach material handling crane (MHC), the M1075 is not. A dp Manufacturing PLS-22K self-recovery winch with a capacity of 9,072 kg is an option on both the M1074 and M1075.|$|R
5000|$|The {{light-duty}} trucks use the 1500 name. They {{are available}} in three cab lengths, 2-door standard/regular cab, 4-door extended cab, and front-hinged 4-door crew cab. Three <b>cargo</b> <b>beds</b> are available: a 69.2 in short box, 78.7 in standard box, and a 97.6 in long box. The short box is only available with the extended or crew cab, {{and is the only}} option on the latter.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} version had a pressed-steel cab with a truck-like configuration {{similar to the}} wheeled trucks. The next two versions - RSO/02 and 03 - had a simpler, soft-top, slab-sided metal cab. All models had wooden, drop-side <b>cargo</b> <b>beds</b> typical of light trucks of the era. It had a ground clearance of 55 cm and was originally powered by a gasoline Steyr V8 cylinder engine of 3.5 l giving , which in the RSO/03 Magirus-produced vehicles {{was replaced by a}} better-performing (although lower powered -66 hp) Deutz diesel air-cooled engine.|$|R
50|$|A Roadster utility is an {{automobile}} with an open-topped roadster {{body and a}} rear <b>cargo</b> <b>bed.</b> The concept {{is similar to that}} of the coupe utility which combines a closed coupe body with a rear <b>cargo</b> <b>bed.</b> The style was common in Australia prior to World War II. The term Light Delivery was often used for the roadster utility in that country.|$|E
5000|$|Two <b>cargo</b> <b>bed</b> lengths were used; {{one for the}} seven-foot long-bed model, which {{appeared}} first in 1986, and a second, shorter version for the six-foot <b>cargo</b> <b>bed,</b> which debuted for the 1987 model year. Unlike other pickups {{of the time that}} used C-channel frames, the Comanche's frame design (called a [...] "Uniframe" [...] by Jeep) under the <b>cargo</b> <b>bed</b> was fully boxed, with a large X structure centered over the rear axle. For strength, the rails were over eight inches deep (top to bottom), much deeper than conventional midsize truck frames (1983 Jeep J-10 full-size truck frame is 6.75 inches at the deepest point). This structure was pioneered by AMC for the 1971 [...] "Cowboy" [...] compact pickup prototype.|$|E
50|$|As {{noted the}} {{original}} basic gasoline-powered truck variants were first the M34, {{and then the}} M35. A long wheel-base variant, designated the M36, was also developed (featuring a 16 ft <b>cargo</b> <b>bed).</b> Variants with a C suffix (such as M35A2C or M36A2C) featured a straight drop-side <b>cargo</b> <b>bed.</b> The M44 and M45 were simply the chassis designation for the 2½-ton series, and this cab/chassis would {{serve as the basis}} for many more specialized variants.|$|E
5000|$|The M35-series trucks {{have been}} sold as surplus both to {{military}} vehicle collectors and to persons or organizations looking for an inexpensive truck capable of off-road operation. Users have included farmers, rural electric utilities, and fire departments. Surplus vehicles may be retained in military configuration, or modified to suit {{the needs of their}} new owners. Such modifications may include [...] "bobbed" [...] chassis with one of the rear axles removed, new <b>cargo</b> <b>beds</b> or boxes, fuel or water tanks, and conversion of the electrical system to 12 volts.|$|R
50|$|These cars {{would be}} {{extensively}} decorated, {{and serve as}} mobile homes and party venues for the russ during the russefeiring. They would be outfitted with tables, chairs, bunk beds, sound and lighting systems, and melodic horns. These vehicles were named russebiler (russ cars). Over the '80s it became fairly common to rip the <b>cargo</b> <b>beds</b> off lorries and build log cabins on the frames instead. However, due to safety issues this practice was banned during the early '90s. Also regulations were introduced that required every russ vehicle to have a designated non-russ driver. This, together with the no-tolerance policy on alcohol consumption by drivers introduced in the late 90s, greatly {{reduced the number of}} accidents involving russ vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|The International Space Station (ISS) is {{the only}} {{permanently}} inhabited structure currently in space. It {{is the size of}} an American football field and has a crew of six. With a living volume of 358 m³, it has more interior room than the <b>cargo</b> <b>beds</b> of two American 18-wheeler trucks. [...] However, because of the microgravity environment of the space station, there are not always well-defined walls, floors, and ceilings and all pressurized areas can be utilized as living and working space. The International Space Station is still under construction. Modules were primarily launched using the Space Shuttle until its deactivation and were assembled by its crew {{with the help of the}} working crew on board the space station. ISS modules were often designed and built to barely fit inside the shuttle's payload bay, which is cylindrical with a 4.6 meter diameter.|$|R
5000|$|The {{simplest}} examples {{were produced}} by simply placing an existing light gun mount {{directly onto the}} <b>cargo</b> <b>bed</b> of the truck, and securing it in place. No armouring or special support equipment was installed. One such conversion was performed in Congo-Leopoldville in 1965, using an Oerlikon GAI 20 mm anti-aircraft gun. Another conversion in the Congo entailed mounting pods with 2.75" [...] aircraft rockets on a pedestal on the <b>cargo</b> <b>bed,</b> but this proved unsuccessful.|$|E
50|$|Vehicles {{featuring}} a coupe passenger compartment with an attached <b>cargo</b> <b>bed.</b> All-steel-bodied utility vehicles, more commonly called utes, were invented in Australia.|$|E
5000|$|The ute {{variant of}} the Ford Falcon has been in {{production}} since 1961. Since the 1999 AU Falcon, the <b>cargo</b> <b>bed</b> has been separate from the cabin, yet it still retains the Falcon sedan front-end and cabin. The <b>cargo</b> <b>bed</b> was separated so that both [...] "utility" [...] and [...] "cab chassis" [...] body styles could be utilized. This separate cab-chassis design challenged {{the notion that the}} word [...] "ute" [...] referred to a monocoque body style.|$|E
5000|$|The {{model was}} {{fitted with a}} [...] inline-six diesel engine, which {{produced}} between , and a gearbox with 8 forward speeds. For the time, Alfa Romeo Mille {{was one of the}} most innovative trucks.Alfa Romeo built the Mille in a rear-wheel drive 4x2 configuration. The Mille could carry 8 metric tons of <b>cargo</b> in the <b>bed</b> and a tow up to 18 tons; a fifth wheel tractor unit version was also made, rated for a 26.2 ton towing capacity. Independent firms offered conversion to three or four axles by adding one or two dead axles, steerable or fixed; maximum bed payload went up respectively to over 10 or 13 tons.Italian Bartoletti made a car transporter version of the Mille in 1963, which could carry up to 8 cars on two levels of the car and trailer.There was also special Mille [...] "Motori Aviazione" [...] made for transportation of aircraft engines made by Alfa Romeo.|$|R

50|$|The AFKWX (A for 1939, F for forward cab, K for all wheel drive, and W for tandem rear axles) 353, a {{cab over engine}} <b>cargo</b> <b>bed</b> {{version of}} the CCKW, went into {{production}} alongside it in 1942 at Yellow’s Pontiac plant and Chevrolet’s in St. Louis. Otherwise mechanically identical, its compact cabin design allowed a 15 ft, and later 17 ft <b>cargo</b> <b>bed</b> to be fitted. The first 50 produced had closed cabs, all others were open. The cab over design made engine maintenance difficult. As a result, only 7235 were built, none with a front-mounted winch.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} variant is {{with short}} cab with canvas and standard <b>cargo</b> <b>bed.</b> Used for transport of personnel (18 + 2 troops with equipment), materials and as tractor for artillery and anti-aircraft artillery weapons.|$|E

50|$|It {{has other}} {{features}} such as an optional T-top split roof, a spring-loaded hidden door for a side step into the <b>cargo</b> <b>bed,</b> and a spare tire mounted under the hood. The spare tire necessitates an oval shaped air intake breather.|$|E
5000|$|Like the Wira, the Arena is of unibody construction, but {{in order}} to sustain {{additional}} loads from the <b>cargo</b> <b>bed,</b> the Arena includes a load-bearing ladder frame connected to a [...] "torque box" [...] for improved body durability and strength.|$|E
50|$|The {{downside}} is that the hitch takes up room in the <b>cargo</b> <b>bed</b> {{regardless of whether the}} trailer is hitched or not. The hitch can be unbolted from the bed but this takes a lot more time and effort than the unhitch operation.|$|E
50|$|The Chevrolet Cheyenne was {{a concept}} car created by Chevrolet. It was first {{introduced}} at the 2003 North American International Auto Show.

5000|$|Production for the Rhino {{began in}} Yamaha's {{facility}} in Newnan Georgia in 2004 {{and ended with}} the 2013 model year. Many have regarded the Rhino {{as one of the}} industry's most versatile UTV machines. The Rhino's size is well suited to many different tasks ranging from recreation to work due to its medium-size chassis and <b>cargo</b> <b>bed.</b> The smaller nature of the design suit those who prefer to operate in tighter riding environments like wooded areas, while the <b>cargo</b> <b>bed</b> is still big enough to carry equipment or supplies. Prior to the Rhino's debut, the UTV market was dominated by slow, heavy, oversized machines designed strictly for work use. The Rhino's faster top speed, powerful engine, nimble independent suspension, and overall smaller size proved popular.|$|E

50|$|The Jeep Comanche (designated MJ) is {{a pickup}} truck variant of the Cherokee compact SUV (1984-2001) {{manufactured}} and marketed by Jeep for model years 1986-1992 in rear wheel (RWD) and four-wheel drive (4WD) models {{as well as two}} <b>cargo</b> <b>bed</b> lengths: six-feet (1.83 metres) and seven-feet (2.13 metres).|$|E
5000|$|The KC {{truck was}} used on Japanese {{military}} airfields to start aircraft engines. A power take-off {{was taken from}} after the gearbox. It rose behind the cabin and then projected forward. This was mated to the spinner on an aircraft's propeller to start the aircraft engine. Because it wasn't used for heavy cargo, the <b>cargo</b> <b>bed</b> was narrow and the rear wheels were singles instead of the normal doubles. Also, the cabin was very basic, having plywood sides, no doors and a canvas roof. Running boards were unique to the starter truck due to the narrow <b>cargo</b> <b>bed.</b> Hasegawa made a 1:72 scale plastic model of the KC starter truck labelled as [...] "Starter Truck Toyota GB", even although the real GB had a curved radiator grill and more complex bodywork.|$|E
