5000|$|The {{origins of}} the current Dutch {{criminal}} <b>code</b> <b>date</b> back to 1811 when the Netherlands was incorporated into the French Empire. [...] After the Dutch gained independence, the Napoleonic Code was largely kept but the philosophy underlying these criminal sanctions changed. Specifically, a more humane system replaced French penal philosophy. Nineteenth century Dutch prisons did not distinguish between adult and juvenile offenders; offenders regularly resided in common quarters. Subsequent to Dutch independence, these practices grew out of favor as they failed {{to conform to the}} Dutch conception of punishment. A group of concerned citizens assembled the Dutch Association for the Moral Improvement of Prisoners to combat the frequently harsh prison environment. The organization's focus was to make prisons more humane by advocating training for offenders, specifically that of a religious and educational nature. These rehabilitative goals persisted well into the 20th century.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{public is}} {{less willing to}} allow their {{personal}} health information to be disclosed for research purposes {{if they do not}} trust researchers and how researchers manage their data. However, the public is more comfortable with their data being used for research if the risk of re-identification is low. There are few studies on the risk of re-identification of Canadians from their basic demographics, and no studies on their risk from their longitudinal data. Our objective was to estimate the risk of re-identification from the basic cross-sectional and longitudinal demographics of Canadians. Methods Uniqueness is a common measure of re-identification risk. Demographic data on a 25 % random sample of the population of Montreal were analyzed to estimate population uniqueness on postal <b>code,</b> <b>date</b> of birth, and gender as well as their generalizations, for periods ranging from 1 year to 11 years. Results Almost 98 % of the population was unique on full postal <b>code,</b> <b>date</b> of birth and gender: these three variables are effectively a unique identifier for Montrealers. Uniqueness increased for longitudinal data. Considerable generalization was required to reach acceptably low uniqueness levels, especially for longitudinal data. Detailed guidelines and disclosure policies on how to ensure that the re-identification risk is low are provided. Conclusions A large percentage of Montreal residents are unique on basic demographics. For non-longitudinal data sets, the three character postal code, gender, and month/year of birth represent sufficiently low re-identification risk. Data custodians need to generalize their demographic information further for longitudinal data sets. </p...|$|E

40|$|Providing {{a package}} that can {{actively}} participate in prolonging the product shelf life of orange juice adds value, both financially and nutritionally, to the product and to the package. The <b>code</b> <b>date</b> and shelf life of orange juice is in part determined by {{the ability of the}} product to maintain the level of vitamin C as stated on the nutritional label. Vitamin C deteriorates in the presence of oxygen; therefore, removal of oxygen from the package will decelerate the process of oxidation thereby diminishing the loss of vitamin C and prolonging the quality of the orange juice. The refrigerated shelf life of orange juice packaged in a polyethylene-coated paperboard gable top carton generally has a limited shelf life of three weeks. The addition of an oxygen barrier layer, such as nylon, on the inside structure of the carton can extend the shelf life of orange juice to 6 weeks. It has been our finding that at eight weeks orange juice packaged in a gable top carton with an Oxygen Scavenger (OSPTM) lining maintained 35 % more vitamin C than the standard barrier carton. This is a significant packaging improvement and indicates that extending shelf stability beyond the eight week test period is possible by incorporating the OSPTM system...|$|E

With the introduction of EU Regulation 178 / 2002 to have mandatory traceability for food supply without defined structure of product or process to be traced makes the level of traceability a vulnerable aspect across the supply chain. The level of traceability is strongly associated with the resources required to trace & track and the supplier buyer relationship, which would help to implement an effective traceability systemThe objective of the study is to understand the interrelationship between the level of traceability (breadth, depth and quality of information) and the resources required (technology,financial and human) in achieving the given level of traceability and contribution of supplier-buyer relationship on the supply chain traceability performance using a case study based approach. The study shows as the dairy products are split into individual unit for the retail stores and not associating the batch number to the product movement from the distribution center to the retailers would create the critical traceability uniform tracking and tracing system would help in efficiency gain by reducing the product receiving time approximately from 4 hours to 20 minutes, which can reduce in humanly efforts at this stage and may help in achieving huge cost savings...|$|E
