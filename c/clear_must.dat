In the marketplace it has another sense. When we speak of beauty in the second {{sense of the term}} our judgement is influenced in the first place by the art itself and by the form of that art. The image, it is <b>clear,</b> <b>must</b> be set between the mind or senses of the artist himself and the mind or senses of others. If you bear this in memory you will see that art necessarily divides itself into three forms progressing from one to the next. These forms are: the lyrical form, the form wherein the artist presents his image in immediate relation to himself; the epical form, the form wherein he presents his image in mediate relation to himself and to others; the dramatic form, the form wherein he presents his image in immediate relation to others.|$|E

For {{the atomic}} bomb renders anticlimactical even {{the ending of the}} {{greatest}} war in history seems imminent as this goes to press. 1 The concepts 'WAR' and 'PROGRESS,' ARE NOW OBSOLETE. Both suggest human aspirations, emotions, aims, consciousness. 'The greatest achievement of organized science in history,' said President Truman after the Hiroshima catastrophe--which it probably was, and so much the worse for organized science. Such 'progress' fills no human needs of either the destroyed or the destroyers. And a war of atomic bombs is not a war. It is a scientific experiment. 2 THE FUTILITY OF MODERN WARFARE SHOULD NOW BE <b>CLEAR.</b> <b>Must</b> we not now conclude, with Simone Weil, that the technical aspect of war today is the evil, regardless of political factors? Can one imagine that {{the atomic bomb}} could ever be used 'in a good cause'? Do not such means, instantly, of themselves, corrupt ANY cause? 3 ATOMIC BOMBS ARE THE NATURAL PRODUCT OF THE KIND OF SOCIETY WE HAVE CREATED. They are as easy, normal and unforced an expression of the American Standard of Living as electric iceboxes. We do not dream of a world in which atomic fission will be 'harnessed to constructive ends.' The new energy will be at the service of the rulers; it will change their strength but not their aims. The underlying population should regard this new source of energy with lively interest--the interest of victims. 4 THOSE WHO WIELD SUCH DESTRUCTIVE POWER ARE OUTCASTS FROM HUMANITY. They may be gods, they may be brutes, but they are not men. 5 WE MUST 'GET' THE MODERN NATIONAL STATE BEFORE IT 'GETS' US. The crazy and murderous nature of the kind of society we have created is underlined by the atomic bomb. Every individual who wants to save his humanity--and indeed his skin--had better begin thinking 'dangerous thoughts' about sabotage, resistance, rebellion, and the fraternity of all men everywhere. The mental attitude known as 'negativism' is a good start." ...|$|E

40|$|ARCHER, {{the current}} European R&D project on Advanced High-Temperature Reactors for Cogeneration of Heat and Electricity is {{developing}} HTR technology to support demonstration of nuclear cogeneration {{as an alternative}} to fossil fuel use in industry. Nuclear cogeneration is identified as a high-potential contribution to European energy security and ARCHER is performed in line with European energy strategies and policy tools. The project consortium comprises of conventional and nuclear industry, utilities, technical support organisations, R&D institutes and universities. ARCHER is integrated internationally via the Generation IV International Forum and through collaboration with international partners, as well as through cooperation with the IAEA. As ARCHER deals with a nuclear technology that may become an important infrastructure asset in the future, the consortium decided to leap forward in its communication by addressing the general public with a telecast, similar to the documentary on CERN and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), produced in 2009 by the Austrian Broadcast Corporation ORF, available as Video-on-Demand at [URL] During 45 minutes, the ARCHER telecast provides background information on the principles of nuclear power generation and will analyse without any bias {{the pros and cons of}} Nuclear Cogeneration and High-Temperature Reactor technology. Now that the film shootings for the telecast are halfway through, it is time to reflect on the lessons learned in devising the documentary, the dos and don'ts both from a scientist's and journalist's perspective and as such to provide an insight into journalistic thinking and recommendations for communicating emotionally challenging topics like nuclear energy in a constructive manner. In the light of Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima, finding a way to ensure trustworthy communication vis-à-vis the general public is a <b>clear</b> <b>MUST</b> for the nuclear sector. JRC.

40|$|Businesses are {{exploiting}} perceived gaps in {{the structure}} of copyright rights by ingeniously designing their technologies to fulfill demand for individual access through a structure of personalized copies and playback engineered in ways intended to implicate neither the public performance nor the reproduction rights. The archetypal example is Aereo Inc. ’s system for providing online access to broadcast television. Aereo allows users to tune into individual antennae to stream TV to themselves, near-live, online. Aereo’s activities look a lot like the retransmission of broadcast signals, an activity which Congress has made very <b>clear</b> <b>must</b> result in remuneration for rightholders. However, Aereo’s careful design, which assigns each user her own antenna to generate an individual transmission copy from which she can access only the signals she could freely pick up from her own rooftop, means that it can also be argued that Aereo is simply enabling consumers to engage in legitimate non-remunerable uses. If the legality of this design is upheld by the Supreme Court this term, Aereo and subsequent comers will be able to offer consumers on-demand access to content, in a way that competes with licensed services, without any obligation to remunerate the rightholder. The implications of these business models are significant: in the case of audio and audiovisual works, for example, the on-demand access market may soon exceed the value of the retention copy-based market. When some participants are licensed but their competitors are not, the imbalance may provoke licensees to revise or forego their agreements. More generally, opportunistic engineering choices that obscure some courts’ perceptions of the impact on the on-demand access market risk removing evolving markets from the scope of copyright owners’ exclusive rights. Businesses that free-ride on copyrighted works also obtain an unfair competitive advantage over copyright licensees. The authors of this paper approach copyright from very different perspectives, but are united in the view that it is undesirable for legal outcomes to depend so heavily on technical design. This article addresses the U. S. caselaw that encouraged businesses such as Aereo to design technologies that could rival or even displace copyright-remunerative modes of making works of authorship available to the public. We consider the implications for copyright owners were Aereo and its supporters to succeed in their reading of the Copyright Act, as well as the implications for other technologies, particularly those involving “cloud” storage, were the broadcasters to prevail. Finally, each author offers her own analysis to demonstrate how it is possible to read the U. S. Copyright Act’s transmit clause {{in a way that does}} not make technological design determine the outcome. Either one of our readings, we argue, enables copyright’s exclusive rights to remain effective without discouraging technological innovation...|$|E
