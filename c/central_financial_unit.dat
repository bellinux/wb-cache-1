40|$|This paper {{assumes that}} {{financial}} fluctuations {{are the result}} of the dynamic interaction between liquidity and solvency conditions of individual <b>financial</b> <b>units.</b> The framework is designed as a heterogeneous agent model which proceeds through discrete time steps within a finite time horizon. The interaction at the micro-level between <b>financial</b> <b>units</b> and the market maker, {{who is in charge of}} clearing the market, produces interesting complex dynamics. The model is analyzed by means of numerical simulations and agent-based computational economics (ACE) approach. The behaviour and evolution of <b>financial</b> <b>units</b> are studied for different parameter regimes in order to show the importance of the parameter setting in the emergence of complex dynamics. Monetary policy implications for the banking sector are also discussed...|$|R
