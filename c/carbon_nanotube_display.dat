The thermal {{properties}} of <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotubes</b> <b>display</b> {{a wide range}} of behaviors which are related both to their graphitic nature and their unique struc-ture and size. The specific heat of individual nanotubes should be similar to that of two-dimensional graphene at high temperatures, with the effects of phonon quan-tization becoming apparent at lower temperatures.

Because of their reduced dimensionality, graphene and <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotubes</b> <b>display</b> unusual mechanical behavior; in particular, their dynamics is highly nonlinear. Here, we review several types of nonlinear behavior in resonators made from nanotubes and graphene. We first discuss an unprecedented scenario where damping is described by a nonlinear force. This scenario is supported by several experimental facts: (i) the quality factor varies with the amplitude of the motion as a power law whose exponent coincides with the value predicted by the nonlinear damping model, (ii) hysteretic behavior (of the motional amplitude {{as a function of}} driving frequency) is absent in some of our resonators even for large driving forces, as expected when nonlinear damping forces are large, and (iii) when we quantify the linear damping force (by performing parametric excitation measurements) we find that it is significantly smaller than the nonlinear damping force. We then review parametric excitation measurements, an alternative actuation method which is based on nonlinear dynamics. Finally, we discuss experiments where the mechanical motion is coupled to electron transport through a nanotube. The coupling can be made so strong that the associated force acting on the nanotube becomes highly nonlinear with displacement and velocity. Overall, graphene and nanotube resonators hold promise for future studies on classical and quantum nonlinear dynamics.

Cells cultured on multi‐walled <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotubes</b> <b>displayed</b> reduced proliferation and altered cytoskeletal development, thought to be due to the undermining of the maturation of focal adhesions. Development of an electrospinning chamber enabled the creation of poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(lactic acid) and poly(caprolactone) fibres for the study of cellular response to nano‐ and macro‐fibrous scaffolds. Cell attachment and organisation on the electrospun fibres was visualised using scanning electron microscopy, oblique microscopy and live cell microscopy. It was found that the incorporation of nanofibres into scaffolds restricts the maturation of focal adhesions which modulates cytoskeletal formation. This can be used to restrict the migration and the proliferation of attachment dependant cells such as osteoblasts or maintain the differentiation of cells such as chodrocytes. To scale up electrospun fibre production, use of rotating collectors, multi‐jet spinning and secondary electrodes to focus the spinning were investigated. Further to this, development of an array of focusing electrodes to control, stabilise and deflect the jet was also investigated towards the creation of a rapid‐prototype electrospinning system.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{dedicated}} to the application of a large-scale first-principles approach to study the electronic structure and quantum conductance of realistic nanomaterials. Three systems are studied using Landauer formalism, Green's function technique and maximally localized Wannier functions. The main focus of this thesis lies on clarifying the effect of chemical modifications on electron transport at the nanoscale, as well as on predicting and designing new type of molecular and nanoelectronic devices. In the first study, we suggest and investigate a quantum interference effect in the porphyrin family molecules. We show that the transmission through a porphyrin molecule at or near the Fermi level varies by orders of magnitude following hydrogen tautomerization. The switching behavior identified in porphyrins implies new application directions in single molecular devices and molecular-size memory elements. Moving on from single molecules to a larger scale, we study the effect of chemical functionalizations to the transport properties of <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotubes.</b> We propose several covalent functionalization schemes for <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotubes</b> which <b>display</b> switchable on/off conductance in metallic tubes. The switching action is achieved by reversible control of bond-cleavage chemistry in [1 + 2] cycloadditions, via the 8 p 3 8 s p 2 rehybridization it induces; this leads to remarkable changes of conductance even at very low degrees of functionalization. Several strategies for real-time control on the conductance of <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotubes</b> are then proposed. Such designer functional groups would allow for the first time direct control of the electrical properties of metallic <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotubes,</b> with extensive applications in nanoscale devices. In {{the last part of the}} thesis we address the issue of low electrical conductivity observed in <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotube</b> networks. We characterize intertube tunneling between <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotube</b> junctions with or without a covalent linker, and explore the possibility of improving intertube coupling and enhance electrical tunneling by transition metal adsorptions on CNT surfaces. The strong hybridization between transition metal d orbitals with the CNT [pi] orbitals serves as an excellent electrical bridge for a broken <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotube</b> junction. The binding and coupling between a transition metal atom and sandwiching nanotubes can be even stronger in case of nitrogendoped <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotubes.</b> Our studies suggest a more effective strategy than the current cross-linking methods used in <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotube</b> networks. by Elise Yu-Tzu Li.

40|$|Recent {{measurements}} in single-walled <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotubes</b> show that, on resonance, all <b>nanotubes</b> <b>display</b> {{the same}} peak optical conductivity of approximately 8 e^ 2 /h, independent of radius or chirality [Joh et al., Nature Nanotechnology 6, 51 (2011) ]. We {{show that this}} uniform peak conductivity {{is a consequence of}} the relativistic band structure and strength of the Coulomb interaction in <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotubes.</b> We further construct a minimalist model of exciton dynamics that describes the general phenomenology and provides an accurate prediction of the numerical value of the peak optical conductivity. The work illustrates the need for careful treatment of relaxation mechanisms in modeling the optoelectronic properties of <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotubes.</b> Comment: 4 pages, 1 figur...|$|R
40|$|Field {{emission}} from <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotubes</b> (CNT) for <b>display</b> purposes was optimized using Design of Experiments (DOE). The brightness was {{improved by}} three {{orders of magnitude}} but the achieved gains could not be sustained in the “Control ” phase of a DMAIC project and the process reverted to poor performance. It took an intense effort of circa two months to recover the process. Monte Carlo simulations were used to provide {{an excellent fit to}} all the measured emission data over the course of eight months in both range and shape. The simulations were also indicating the cause of the process drift. A hidden factor that was too time- and labor-intensive to measure in real-time was responsible and uncovered. With the aid of the simulations the process could have been recovered within days instead of months. ...|$|R
40|$|We have {{fabricated}} a <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotube</b> {{field emission}} <b>display</b> (CNT-FED) panel with a 2 -inch diagonal size {{by using a}} screen printing method and vacuum in-line sealing technology. The sealing temperature of the panel was around 390 °C and the vacuum level was obtained with 1. 4 × 10 - 5 torr at the sealing. When the field emission properties of a fabricated and sealed CNT-FED panel were characterized and {{compared with those of}} the unsealed panel which was located in a test chamber of vacuum level similar with the sealed panel. As a result, the sealed panel showed similar I-V characteristics with unsealed one and uniform light emission with very high brightness at a current density of 243 µA/cm 2, obtained at the electric field of 10 V/µm...|$|R
