According to the microscopic cutter wear and surface roughness generated in the experiments of using different media (such as: <b>cold</b> <b>wind</b> oil-mist, <b>cold</b> <b>wind</b> and normal temperature oil-mist) to cut the alloy, the influences of different media cutting conditions on cutter wear and the surface roughness of a workpiece in the high-speed cutting Ni-base superalloy are studied, and the rule {{to improve the quality of}} surface processing of Ni-base superalloy under the condition of the <b>cold</b> <b>wind</b> high-speed cutting is revealed...|$|R
