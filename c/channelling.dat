5|$|In December 2007, Winehouse's {{spokesman}} {{reported that}} the singer was in a physician-supervised programme and was <b>channelling</b> her difficulties by writing a lot of music. The British tabloid The Sun posted a video of a woman, alleged to be Winehouse, apparently smoking crack cocaine and speaking of having taken ecstasy and valium. Winehouse's father moved in with her, and Island Records, her record label, announced the abandonment of plans for an American promotion campaign on her behalf. In late January 2008, Winehouse reportedly entered a rehabilitation facility for a two-week treatment program.|$|E
5|$|It {{is often}} claimed {{that at the}} time, the pass of Thermopylae {{consisted}} of a track along {{the shore of the}} Malian Gulf so narrow that only one chariot could pass through at a time. In fact, as noted below, the pass was 100 metres wide, probably wider than the Greeks could have held against the Persian hordes. Herodotus reports that the Phocians had improved the defenses of the pass by <b>channelling</b> the stream from the hot springs to create a marsh, and it was a causeway across this marsh which was only wide enough for a single chariot to traverse. In a later passage, describing a Gaulish attempt to force the pass, Herodotus describes how the Gauls who fell into the marsh disappeared and were drowned.|$|E
5|$|The media {{objected to}} Aberhart's plan to place his government's {{future in the}} hands of the 10% of Albertans who were Social Credit members; the Calgary Herald called for an {{immediate}} election. To many Social Credit MLAs, Aberhart's greater offense was bypassing them, the people's elected representatives. This was especially irksome in view of social credit's political philosophy, which favoured technocratic rule and held that elected representatives' only legitimate function was <b>channelling</b> the public desire; by appealing directly to Social Credit members, Aberhart appeared to be denying the MLAs even this role. In the legislature, Conservative leader David Duggan called for Aberhart's resignation; in a move that Brennan reports shocked the assembly, his call was endorsed by Social Credit backbencher Albert Blue.|$|E

25|$|Qatar Charity’s {{track record}} of terror {{financing}} includes support to members of al-Qaeda in Chechnya, an accusation publicly denied by Hamad bin Nasser al-Thani. In 1999 Qatar Charity supposedly funneled money to Chechnya-based al-Qaeda affiliates. Furthermore, Qatar Charity is among the NGOs allegedly <b>channelling</b> funds to Ansar Dine in North Mali, a piece of information confirmed by French military intelligence reports dating back to France’s intervention {{in the country in}} early 2013.

25|$|In 2006, due {{to years}} of wear and tear, the {{original}} concert stage floor was replaced {{at a cost of}} $250,000. In order to avoid any change {{to the sound of the}} hall, the new floor was built using same methods and materials as the original. These included tongue-in-groove, three-quarter inch, hard maple boards, a compressed wool underlayment and hardened steel cut nails, hammered in by hand. The vertical grain fir subfloor from 1899 was in excellent shape and was left in place. The nails used in the new floor were hand cut using the same size and construction as the originals and the back <b>channelling</b> on the original maple top boards was replicated as well.|$|E
25|$|Despite being {{advertised as}} an action-oriented series, the series' {{uniqueness}} primarily stems from its de-emphasis on action as such and greater reliance on well-crafted dialogue and complex plot structures more {{common to the}} genre of sophisticated spy-fi as influenced by film noir and neo-noir. Since its inception, the series {{did not have a}} large enough budget to finance complex action sequences (as seen in later dramatic spy fiction or spy thriller television series such as Alias or 24). Its creative team exhibited great ingenuity marshalling its modest resources, <b>channelling</b> their energies into the writing of episodes with more complex plot structures, fuller character development, and more substantial dialogue for the series' actors (all of which aspects are less costly than filming special effects in action sequences).|$|E
25|$|The {{front row}} {{are usually the}} stockiest members of the scrum. Hookers are {{normally}} smaller than props so they may manoeuvre their lower bodies within the tight confines of the front row and tunnel. Props and locks both need to be strong, but the positions differ in their main criteria for selection. Since props are more directly involved in wrestling for position and <b>channelling</b> the drive forward, strength and weight are of prime importance for them. Strength is also important for locks, since they also push; however, height is more important for them {{than it is for}} front-row players. Locks are virtually always the tallest players on the team; they are used as the primary contestants for possession in another phase of the game, the line-out. Flankers and the number 8 do less of the pushing in the scrum, and need more speed, because their task is to quickly tackle or cover the opposing half-backs if the opposition wins the scrum. Approximately 40% {{of the power of the}} scrum is produced in the front row itself. In most professional teams the forward pack weighs at least 800 kg (1764 lbs).|$|E
