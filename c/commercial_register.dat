2500|$|In 1917, Karl Rapp's son-in-law, Max Wiedmann, held about 80 {{percent of}} the shares in Rapp Motorenwerke. He had {{obtained}} most of these shares from his father-in- law in 1914 and had thus become a figure of great influence in the business. Even after the name-change to Bayerische Motoren Werke GmbH, Wiedmann remained the principal shareholder in the company. [...] Wiedmann’s capitulation in July 1918 {{opened the way for}} the founding of a public limited company. On 13 August 1918, BMW AG was entered as a new company in the <b>Commercial</b> <b>Register</b> and took over from BMW GmbH all its manufacturing assets, order book and workforce. The old BMW GmbH was renamed [...] "Maschinenwerke Schleißheimerstrasse" [...] and was wound up on 12 November 1918. The share capital of BMW AG amounting to 12 million reichsmarks was subscribed by three groups of investors. One third of the shares was taken up in equal parts by the Bayerische Bank and the Norddeutsche Bank. A further third of the shares (worth 4 million reichsmarks) was acquired by the Nuremberg industrialist, Fritz Neumeyer. This ensured that 50 {{percent of the}} capital (6 million reichsmarks) was in the hands of Bavarian businesses or banks. The Bavarian government placed the highest value on this strong local shareholding. The final one-third of the BMW shares were taken up by a Viennese financier, Camillo Castiglioni.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an approach for {{the recognition of}} invalidation lines and its use to summarize the valid information in structured text. This approach is applied to an interactive user interface to assist the capture of data sets from scanned <b>commercial</b> <b>registers</b> into a data base system. Invalidation lines are hand drawn lines below the invalid words or text lines (originally in red, but black in scanned binary images). In a first step segmentation of the text objects (block, line, word, character) is performed based on a fast connected component analysis using sub-components, which is robust against touching lines. In a second step horizontal lines are localized with a run-length-based line finder. Invalidation is performed on a word or text line level based on the neighborhood relation between text objects and invalidation lines. In several hundred pages of <b>commercial</b> <b>registers</b> the invalidations are recognized with about 90 % accuracy at about 10 % rejection threshold. The error rate (i. e. invalidation of a valid word) is less than 0. 5 %. For most data sets it is sufficient to eliminate the invalidated text from further OCR and syntactical analysis, so the summarization is already finished on the layout level. For other data sets the valid data fields have to be augmented by data fields from earlier invalidated entries, which is performed after OCR using syntactical analysis and string matching. 1...|$|R

50|$|The {{renaming}} of Unaxis {{was delayed}} due to various objections from Rheinmetall and its subsidiaries. When Oerlikon Contraves {{was sold in}} 1999, the then Oerlikon-Bührle secured the right to continue using the protected name Contraves (as in Contraves Space). Nothing was agreed regarding “Oerlikon”, however, {{since it is the}} name of an actual location - Oerlikon was a village that became a district of Zurich in 1934 - and so appears in the names of several dozen companies. For these reasons, for legal purposes the company “Oerlikon” officially refers to itself as OC Oerlikon Corporation, and has only trademarked the new Oerlikon wordmark and logo. At the beginning of September 2006, the media started referring to the company primarily as “Unaxis-Oerlikon”.
