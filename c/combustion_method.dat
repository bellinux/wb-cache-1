50|$|In {{the final}} step a large {{polycyclic}} aromatic hydrocarbon consisting of 13 hexagons and three pentagons was submitted to flash vacuum pyrolysis at 1100 °C and 0.01 Torr. The three carbon chlorine bonds served as free radical incubators and the ball was stitched up in a no-doubt complex series of radical reactions. The chemical yield was low: 0.1 to 1%. A small percentage of fullerenes is formed in any process which involves burning of hydrocarbons, e.g. in candle burning. The yield through a <b>combustion</b> <b>method</b> is often above 1%. The method proposed above does not provide any advantage for synthesis of fullerenes compared to the usual <b>combustion</b> <b>method,</b> and therefore, the organic synthesis of fullerenes remains a challenge for chemistry.|$|E

5000|$|The Paraho {{process can}} be {{operated}} in two different heating modes, which are direct and indirect. [...] The Paraho Direct process evolved from gas combustion retort technology and is classified as an internal <b>combustion</b> <b>method.</b> [...] Accordingly, the Paraho Direct retort is a vertical shaft retort similar to the Kiviter and Fushun retorts, used correspondingly in Estonia and China. [...] However, compared to the earlier gas combustion retorts the Paraho retort's raw oil shale feeding mechanism, gas distributor, and discharge grate have different designs. In the Paraho Direct process, the crushed and screened raw oil shale is fed {{into the top of}} the retort through a rotating distributor. The oil shale descends the retort as a moving bed. [...] The oil shale is heated by the rising combustion gases from {{the lower part of the}} retort and the kerogen in the shale decomposes at about [...] to oil vapour, shale oil gas and spent shale. Heat for pyrolysis comes from the combustion of char in the spent shale. The combustion takes place where air is injected at two levels in the middle of the retort below the pyrolysis section raising the temperature of the shale and the gas to [...] to [...] [...] Collecting tubes at the top of the retort carry shale oil mist, evolved gases and combustion gases into the product separation unit, where oil, water and dust are separated from the gases. For combined removal of liquid droplets and particulates, a wet electrostatic precipitator is used. Cleaned gases from the precipitator are compressed in a compressor. Part of the gas from the compressor is recycled to the bottom of the retort to cool the combusted shale (shale ash) and carry the recovered heat back up the retort. Cooled shale ash exits the retort through the discharge grate in the bottom of the retort. After processing, shale ash is disposed of. The liquid oil is separated from produced water and may be further refined into high quality products. The mixture of evolved gases and combustions gases is available for use as a low quality fuel gas for drying or power generation.|$|E
