5|$|A second {{possible}} aetosaur nest site {{is known}} from northeastern Italy. The nests are preserved as depressions in carbonate rock that are circular or horseshoe-shaped, with high ridges around the sides. They {{appear to be}} unusually <b>complex</b> <b>for</b> nests created by Triassic reptiles. Archosaur footprints were found nearby that resembled aetosaurs, although they were not present in the same layer. Because the tracks were found {{so close to the}} nests, it is likely that aetosaurs built them.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} climate change on teleosts could be {{powerful}} but are <b>complex.</b> <b>For</b> example, increased winter precipitation (rain and snow) could harm populations of freshwater fish in Norway, whereas warmer summers could increase growth of adult fish. In the oceans, teleosts may be able to cope with warming, as it is simply an extension of natural variation in climate. It is uncertain how ocean acidification, caused by rising carbon dioxide levels, might affect teleosts.|$|E

5|$|A {{subdivision}} rule takes a tiling of {{the plane}} by polygons and turns it into a new tiling by subdividing each polygon into smaller polygons. It is finite if there are only finitely many ways that every polygon can subdivide. Each way of subdividing a tile is called a tile type. Each tile type is represented by a label (usually a letter). Every tile type subdivides into smaller tile types. Each edge also gets subdivided according to finitely many edge types. Finite subdivision rules can only subdivide tilings that {{are made up of}} polygons labelled by tile types. Such tilings are called subdivision complexes for the subdivision rule. Given any subdivision <b>complex</b> <b>for</b> a subdivision rule, we can subdivide {{it over and over again}} to get a sequence of tilings.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, Croatian {{historian}} Davor Marijan {{concluded that}} the battle was too <b>complex</b> <b>for</b> the HV and especially for the HVO. He {{also pointed out that}} the HV and HVO suffered from ineffective command structures and poor intelligence, noting that they had failed to detect the presence of the VRS 16th Motorised and the 1st Armoured Brigades early on. Marijan also claims the HV had demobilised ten infantry brigades shortly before the battle, and his view is supported by Colonel General Novica Simić, commander of the VRS 16th Motorised Brigade, assigned to Tactical Group 1, which had been established by the 1st Krajina Corps to carry out the offensive.|$|E
5|$|Devotees can first {{complete}} a ritual circumambulation on the jagati {{starting from the}} main entrance by walking in a clockwise direction (towards the left) before entering the mantapa, following the sculptural clockwise-sequenced reliefs on the outer temple walls depicting a sequence of epic scenes from the Hindu epics. Temples that are not built on a jagati can have steps flanked by elephant balustrades (parapets) {{that lead to the}} mantapa from ground level. An example of a temple that does not exhibit the raised platform is the Bucesvara temple in Korvangla, Hassan District. In temples with two shrines (dvikuta), the vimanas (the shrines or cellae) may be placed either next to each other or on opposite sides. The Lakshmidevi temple at Doddagaddavalli is unique to Hoysala architecture as it has four shrines around a common centre and a fifth shrine within the same <b>complex</b> <b>for</b> the deity Bhairava (a form of Shiva). In addition, four minor shrines exist at each corner of the courtyard (prakaram).|$|E

5|$|Hitler {{moved into}} the Führerbunker on 16 January 1945. He was joined by his senior staff, {{including}} Martin Bormann. In April 1945, Eva Braun and Joseph Goebbels {{moved into the}} Führerbunker while Magda Goebbels and their six children took residence in the upper Vorbunker. Two or three dozen support, medical, and administrative staff were also sheltered there. These included Hitler's secretaries (including Traudl Junge), a nurse named Erna Flegel, and telephone switchboard operator Sergeant Rochus Misch. Early on, Hitler continued to utilize the undamaged wing of the Reich Chancellery, where he held afternoon military conferences in his large study. Afterwards, he would have tea with his secretaries before going {{back down into the}} bunker <b>complex</b> <b>for</b> the night. After several weeks of this routine, Hitler seldom left the bunker except for short strolls in the chancellery garden with his dog Blondi. The bunker was crowded and the atmosphere was oppressive; air raids occurred daily. Hitler mostly stayed on the lower level, where it was quieter and he could sleep. Conferences took place for much of the night, often until 05:00.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the US Army renamed its New York-based Ferryboat 84, a {{ferry boat}} that {{traveled}} to Governors Island in the Upper New York Bay, for Charlton. In September 1954, West Virginia renamed a bridge on the West Virginia Turnpike {{in honor of}} Charlton, the Charlton Memorial Bridge on Interstate 77. Charlton was also memorialized in the Bronx, with a park in the Morrisania area being named for Charlton in 1952, and in 1958 several gardens in Van Cortlandt Park in South Bronx were planted in his honor. These gardens are the site of annual Memorial Day gatherings of the local neighborhood where Charlton and other Bronx residents killed in the Korean War are honored. In 1993, a new barracks <b>complex</b> <b>for</b> US Forces Korea in South Korea was also named in Charlton's honor. In 2000, the United States Navy commissioned the USNS Charlton, a Watson-class vehicle cargo ship. Charlton's sister, Fairy M. Papadopoulos, served as the ship's co-sponsor.|$|E
5|$|In late 1203, John {{attempted}} to relieve Château Gaillard, which although besieged by Philip was guarding the eastern flank of Normandy. John attempted a synchronised operation involving land-based and water-borne forces, considered by most historians today {{to have been}} imaginative in conception, but overly <b>complex</b> <b>for</b> forces of the period to have carried out successfully. John's relief operation was blocked by Philip's forces, and John turned back to Brittany {{in an attempt to}} draw Philip away from eastern Normandy. John successfully devastated much of Brittany, but did not deflect Philip's main thrust into the east of Normandy. Opinions vary amongst historians as to the military skill shown by John during this campaign, with most recent historians arguing that his performance was passable, although not impressive.|$|E

5|$|In {{late summer}} of 1777, British General John Burgoyne led a major {{invasion}} army south from Quebec, {{with the intention}} of splitting off rebellious New England. But General Howe in New York took his army south to Philadelphia instead of going up the Hudson River to join with Burgoyne near Albany—a major strategic mistake. Meanwhile, Washington rushed to Philadelphia to engage Howe, while closely following the action in upstate New York, where the patriots were led by General Philip Schuyler and his successor Horatio Gates. The ensuing pitched battles at Philadelphia were too <b>complex</b> <b>for</b> Washington's relatively inexperienced men and they were defeated.|$|E

5|$|One {{animator}} {{was dedicated}} full-time during {{three years of}} the game's development to work out the boy's animations, including animations that showed anticipation on the player's actions or events in the game, such as reaching out for a cart handle as the player moved the boy near it. Jensen felt this was important as the character was always {{at the center of the}} player's screen, and the most important element to watch. Playdead included gruesome death sequences to highlight incorrect solutions and discourage players from repeating their mistakes. While they expected players to run the boy into numerous deaths while trying solutions, Carlsen stated that their goal was to ensure death wasn't a penalty in the game, and made the death animations entertaining to keep the player interested. Carlsen noted several early puzzles were too <b>complex</b> <b>for</b> the game, but they would end up using a portion of these larger puzzles in the final release.|$|E
5|$|The Earl of Warwick's {{coat of arms}} {{was unusually}} <b>complex</b> <b>for</b> the period, with seven {{different}} quarterings.

The second quarter showed the arms of the Montacutes (quartered with the Monthermer arms). The third quarter showed the arms of Neville differenced by a label for Lancaster to signify descent from Warwick's father, the Earl of Salisbury, who was the eldest son and heir of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland and his wife, Lady Joan Beaufort, daughter of the Duke of Lancaster.|$|E
