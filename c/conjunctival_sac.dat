40|$|Changes in the {{microbial}} {{populations in the}} <b>conjunctival</b> <b>sacs</b> of animals have traditionally been evaluated using conventional microbiology techniques. The goal {{of this study was}} to examine the suitability of a methodology which may reveal a previously unknown microbiome inhabiting feline conjunctival membranes. In the present study, we determined {{the microbial}} diversity in feline conjunctivas based on 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Five taxa not described earlier in veterinary ophthalmology (i. e., Staphylococcus caprae, Staphylococcus succinus, Propionibacterium acnes, Psychrobacter faecalis, and Bacillus subtilis) were identified in feline conjunctivas with a high similarity (99 - 100 %). The study demonstrates that the feline <b>conjunctival</b> <b>sacs</b> are inhabited by much more rich and diverse microbial communities than previously thought using culture-based methods. From the clinical perspective, this could suggest that other laboratory procedures (e. g., extended incubation time in the case of Actinobacteria, formerly order Actinomycetales) or a new tool like culture-independent approaches (next-generation DNA sequencing) should be taken into account...|$|R

Polystomoides Ward, 1917, Polystomoidella Price, 1939 and Neopolystoma Price, 1939, {{according}} {{to the number of}} haptoral hooks. Among the about 55 polystome species that are known to date from the 327 modern living chelonians, only four species of Polystomoides are currently recognised within the 45 South American freshwater turtles. MethodsDuring 2012, several sites {{in the vicinity of the}} cities Cayenne and Kaw in French Guiana were investigated for freshwater turtles. Turtles were collected at six sites and the presence of polystomatid flatworms was assessed from the presence of polystome eggs released by infected specimens. ResultsAmong the three turtle species that were collected, no polystomes were found in the gibba turtle Mesoclemmys gibba (Schweigger, 1812). The spot-legged turtle Rhinoclemmys punctularia (Daudin, 1801) was infected with two species of Neopolystoma Price, 1939, one in the <b>conjunctival</b> <b>sacs</b> and the other in the urinary bladder, while the scorpion mud turtle Kinosternon scorpioides (Linnaeus, 1766) was found to be infected with a single Neopolystoma species in the <b>conjunctival</b> <b>sacs.</b> These parasites could be distinguished from known species of Neopolystoma by a combination of morphological characteristics including body size, number and length of genital spines, shape and size of the testis. They were also differentiated at the molecular level using the cox 1 gene marker. Based on morphological and genetic evidences, three new species are described herein, namely Neopolystoma cayensis n. sp. and Neopolystoma guianensis n. sp. from the bladder and the <b>conjunctival</b> <b>sacs</b> of R. punctularia, respectively, and Neopolystoma scorpioides n. sp. from the <b>conjunctival</b> <b>sacs</b> of K. scorpioides. However the monophyly of Polystomoides and Neopolystoma is still questioned regarding their phylogeny based on a dataset comprising four concatenated genes, namely, 18 S, 28 S and 12 S rRNA genes and cox 1. ConclusionsIn addition to these being the first chelonian polystomes to be reported and described from French Guiana, they represent the first polystomes from the hosts K. scorpioides and R. punctularia and the first representatives of Neopolystoma from South America.

40|$|PURPOSE. Mucosa-associated {{lymphoid tissue}} (MALT) {{represents}} {{a part of}} the immune system located at mucosal surfaces. Its presence in the human eye is the point in question in the current study. Its occurrence, components, topography, and probable functional significance in the human conjunctiva and lacrimal drainage system were investigated. METHODS. Fifty-three complete <b>conjunctival</b> <b>sacs</b> were obtained from cadaveric eyes, prepared as flat wholemounts, stained, optically cleared, observed in total thickness, and sectioned for light microscopic histology, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy. Eight lacrimal sacs and adhering canaliculi were prepared accordingly. RESULTS. Lymphoid tissue was mainly observed in the palpebral conjunctiva, more pronounced in the upper than in the lower lid. It occurred in different forms: 1) In all specimens, diffuse lymphoid tissue of lymphocytes and plasma cells, most of which were IgA positive, formed a thin layer in the lamina propria. The overlying epithelium produced secretory component. 2) In approximately three fifths of the <b>conjunctival</b> <b>sacs,</b> organized follicular accumulations were embedded in this layer.

40|$|PURPOSE. To compare {{isolation}} of staphylococci from periorbital tissues and accessories of orthokeratology (ortho-k) lens and spectacle wearers and investigate prevalence of antiseptic-resistance (QAC) genes. To determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of antiseptics and antibiotic susceptibility of isolates. METHODS. Staphylococci were isolated from eyelids, eyelashes, and <b>conjunctival</b> <b>sacs</b> of 23 ortho-k lens wearers and 20 spectacle wearers. Samples were also collected from ortho-k lenses, lens cases, and spectacle frames. Isolations of Staphylococcus aureus were compared between ortho-k subjects and controls for all samples and for coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) from <b>conjunctival</b> <b>sacs.</b> QAC genes were amplified in 110 Staphylococcus aureus and 59 CNS isolates and prevalence compared in isolates from ortho-k lens and spectacle wearers. Associations were assessed between presence of QAC genes and antibiotic and antiseptic susceptibility. RESULTS. Although {{isolation of}} Staphylococcus aureus {{did not differ}} significantly in periorbital samples from ortho-k and control subjects, QAC genes were significantly more common in both Staphylococcus aureus and CNS from ortho-k subjects (odds ratio 4. 4 and 10. 74, respectively). Overall, qacA/B was the predominant gene detected, being present in 26. 5 % CNS and 11 % Staphylococcus aureus. smr and qacH were present in 12 % of CNS, but were less common in Staphylococcus aureus. QAC gene-positive isolates had higher MICs to benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine digluconate. CONCLUSIONS. Our results suggest that long-term use of multipurpose solutions containing quaternary ammonium compounds may select for carriage of organisms harboring QAC genes. As these genes are associated with antibiotic resistance, their increased prevalence in isolates from contact lens wearers is a concern. School of NursingSchool of Optometr...|$|R

40|$|Nowaday, zoonoses are an {{important}} cause of human parasitic diseases worldwide and {{a major threat to}} the socio-economic development, mainly in developing countries. Importantly, zoonotic helminths that affect human eyes (HIE) may cause blindness with severe socio-economic consequences to human communities. These infections include nematodes, cestodes and trematodes, which may be transmitted by vectors (dirofilariasis, onchocerciasis, thelaziasis), food consumption (sparganosis, trichinellosis) and those acquired indirectly from the environment (ascariasis, echinococcosis, fascioliasis). Adult and/or larval stages of HIE may localize into human ocular tissues externally (i. e., lachrymal glands, eyelids, <b>conjunctival</b> <b>sacs)</b> or into the ocular globe (i. e., intravitreous retina, anterior and or posterior chamber) causing symptoms due to the parasitic localization in the eyes or to the immune reaction they elicit in the host. Unfortunately, data on HIE are scant and mostly limited to case reports from different countries. The biology and epidemiology of the most frequently reported HIE are discussed as well as clinical description of the diseases, diagnostic considerations and video clips on their presentation and surgical treatment.

We further performed antibiotic sensitivity analyses for lacrimal sac culture samples. Methods: A total of 90 patients with primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction were recruited and divided into EX-DCR (n= 32), EN-DCR (n= 28), and TC-DCR (n= 30) groups. Conjunctival, nasal, and lacrimal sac cultures and antibiograms were analyzed. Results: In all three groups, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CNS) was predominantly isolated preoperatively from the conjunctiva, nose, and lacrimal sac and postoperatively from the conjunctiva. Preoperative and postoperative conjunctival culture positivity rates were similar between all the groups (p> 0. 05). A statistically {{significant difference in the}} growth rate of culture in the lacrimal sac was observed between the three groups (p= 0. 001). CNS and Staphylococcus aureus cultures were predominantly sensitive to linezolid, teicoplanin, tigecycline, vancomycin, and mupirocin.

Cultured corneal epithelial cells were inoculated with 106 CFU of one of 10 strains of P. aeruginosa (five cytotoxic, five invasive) /ml with or without reflex tear fluid collected from the <b>conjunctival</b> <b>sacs</b> of human volunteers. Cytotoxicity was assessed by observation of trypan blue staining and measurement of lactate dehydrogenase release; invasion was quantified by using gentamicin survival assays. Tear fluid retarded growth of only 50 % of the P. aeruginosa strains (three of five invasive strains, two of five cytotoxic strains) yet protected corneal cells against invasion by or cytotoxicity of 9 of 10 strains. The only strain resistant to the tear cytoprotective effects was susceptible to tear bacteriostatic activity. Dilution of tear fluid threefold significantly reduced cytoprotection, while bacteriostatic activity prevailed with dilutions beyond 100 -fold. Sulfacetamide (1 mg/ml) with bacteriostatic activity matching that of tear fluid was less cytoprotective than tear fluid (80 % protection with tear fluid, 48 % with sulfacetamide). Video microscopy revealed bacterial chain formation in both tear fluid and sulfacetamide, but tear fluid also blocked bacterial swimming motility. After prolonged tear contact, bacteria regained normal growth rates, swimming motility, and cytotoxic activity, suggesting a breakdown of protective tear factors. Boiled tear fluid lost bacteriostatic activity and effects on bacterial motility but retained cytoprotective function. These results suggest that human tear fluid can protect corneal epithelial cells against P. aeruginosa virulence mechanisms in a manner not dependent upon bacteriostatic activity or effects on bacterial motility.

All nematodes collected were morphologically identified and molecularly characterized by sequencing of partial cox 1 gene. Results: T. callipaeda was observed in 51 (27. 71...|$|E
40|$|Thelazia callipaeda infects {{the eyes}} of {{carnivores}} and humans in Far Eastern Asiatic and European countries. Studies have demonstrated the occurrence of T. callipaeda in foxes from areas where canine thelaziosis is endemic. However, there is little information {{on the role of}} wild carnivores as hosts of this nematode. From May 2003 to May 2009, a total of 130 carcasses of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes; n= 75), wolves (Canis lupus; n= 2), beech martens (Martes foina; n= 22), brown hares (Lepus europaeus; n= 13), Eurasian badgers (Meles meles; n= 10), and wild cats (Felis silvestris; n= 8) were examined in an area of southern Italy where canine thelaziosis is highly prevalent. At necropsy, animals were examined and nematodes were collected from the <b>conjunctival</b> <b>sacs</b> of both eyes. All nematodes were morphologically identified and at least five specimens from each of the five host species were molecularly processed by PCR amplification and sequencing of a partial mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene (cox 1). Five out of the six wild animal species examined were found to be infected with eyeworms. The overall infection rate, excluding the Eurasian badgers that were all negative, was 39. 1 %. All the 189 adult nematodes collected (intensity of infection= 4 +/- 2. 2) were morphologically identified as T. callipaeda. The molecular analysis confirmed that the only haplotype of T. callipaeda circulating in Europe (i. e., haplotype 1) is present in that area. The competence of red foxes, wolves, beech martens, brown hares, and wild cats as definitive hosts for T. callipaeda is discussed in relationship to their ecology and their likely exposure to the vector Phortica variegata in the study area. The role the wild fauna plays in maintaining and spreading eyeworm infection in humans and domestic animals is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Background: Pterygium {{is one of}} {{the most}} common conjunctival {{diseases}} among ophthalmic pathologies. The frequency of recurrences is high, either after surgical treatment or after treatment combined with mitomycin C or beta-radiation therapy. Aims: The purpose of this study was to determine whether concanavalin A (ConA) lectin bound to the pterygial surface can be used to detect recurrence or remnants of pterygium after surgical excision. Materials and Methods: This was a prospective study on 20 patients with pterygium, divided in five stages, pre-surgery, early post-surgery (24 h), late post-surgery (seven days), very late post-surgery (four weeks) and two months after the procedure. A drop of fluorescein-marked Con A (35 &#x 00 B 5;g/mL) was instilled in the lower <b>conjunctival</b> eyelid <b>sac</b> and the eye was exposed to the light of a Wood&#x 2032;s lamp for an average of five seconds. Results: Out of the 20 patients, eight patients were found to have fluorescent stretch marks over the scar corresponding to residual pterygial tissue at four weeks; two months after the procedure of re-surgery we observed no fluorescent remnants. All residual pterygia were confirmed through histochemistry studies. Conclusion: It was possible to detect remnants of pterygium in postoperative patients and recurrences in early pre-clinical stages through the visualization of fluorescent ConA bound to the pterygial surface...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{study the}} indications, {{technique}} and diagnostic utility of helical computed tomographic dacryocystography (CTDCG). Materials and Methods: Retrospective analysis of 13 patients who underwent CTDCG with subsequent surgical intervention, {{during the period}} January 2003 to December 2005, was done. Axial plain computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, followed by administration of water-soluble contrast in the <b>conjunctival</b> cul de <b>sac</b> or by cannulation of the lacrimal passages. Thin-slice helical CT with two-dimensional (2 D) and three-dimensional (3 D) coronal and sagittal reformation was done. Results: Four patients were males and 9 were females. Age range was 5 to 62 years. Seven patients presented with watering and 6 patients with a medial canthal mass. Three patients had history of trauma. CTDCG was performed by instillation technique in 10 patients and by cannulation in 3 patients. CTDCG showed mass lesion displacing the sac in 5 cases, nasolacrimal duct obstruction in 6 cases and mucocele in 2 cases. Based on the findings on CTDCG, 5 patients underwent mass excision, 7 underwent dacryocystorhinostomy and 1 patient underwent primary silicone tube intubation. Conclusion: Helical CTDCG is a safe and useful diagnostic tool for the lacrimal surgeon. Instillation technique is a physiological and convenient method, and cannulation is needed only in cases where adequate visualization is not achieved...|$|R
