50|$|<b>Ceylonite</b> can {{actually}} undergo a solid solution series {{in which the}} composition changes, {{but it is still}} <b>ceylonite.</b> Magnesium rich <b>ceylonite</b> can undergo an increase in iron that will replace the magnesium cation in the A-block, therefore making the new composition Fe2+Al2O4. The chemistry changes, but the mineral technically remains <b>ceylonite.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Ceylonite</b> and pleonaste are {{historical}} {{terms in}} mineralogy. Nevertheless, both terms {{are used in}} the current mineralogical literature.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ceylonite</b> (first cited 1793) and pleonaste (first cited 1801) are dingy blue or grey {{to black}} {{varieties}} of spinel. <b>Ceylonite,</b> {{named for the}} island of Ceylon, is a ferroan spinel with Mg:Fe from 3:1 and 1:1, and little or no ferric iron. Pleonaste is named from the Greek for 'abundant,' for its many crystal forms, and is distinguished chemically by low Mg:Fe ratios of approximately 1:3. It is sometimes used as a gemstone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ceylonite</b> has the {{structural}} formula AAl2O4, where A cation is Mg2+ or Fe2+. This formula creates a {{face centered cubic}} Bravais lattice, with a space group of Fd3m. The point symmetry can be three possibilities; 4*3m, 3*m, or mm.Within the oxygen sub-lattice of <b>ceylonite,</b> the Mg2+ ions occupy tetrahedral 4c symmetry positions, and the Al3+ ions occupy octahedral 8f site. This allows for the remaining octahedral site to be open for defects, causing a variety in structure and physical properties.|$|E
50|$|The grains in {{the first}} {{discovered}} <b>ceylonite</b> looked of compacted soils, leading one to believe they were perhaps sedimentary in formation. This was an early hypothesis, and did not hold true after further analysis.|$|E
5000|$|The next warship sunk was the Kingston <b>Ceylonite,</b> another British naval trawler {{serving in}} American waters off North Carolina. On June 15, the Kingston <b>Ceylonite</b> was sailing off Virginia Beach in convoy KN-109 when she unknowingly entered a sea mine field laid by [...] four days earlier. The British trawler struck one mine at {{position}} [...] and sank. Thirty-three men {{went down with}} the ship and only eighteen survived. Two other tankers and the destroyer [...] also hit mines that night but were saved from sinking. Some of the dead washed up on Ocracoke Island and were interred with the men of HMT Bedfordshire.|$|E
50|$|The Mg-ceylonite has a {{much more}} {{reliable}} study of its geological occurrence. It is found in Mg and Al rich igneous rocks, as well as, metamorphic rock. Like many rocks and mineral, <b>ceylonite</b> is weathered {{and can be found}} in sedimentary rocks.|$|E
50|$|The mineral <b>ceylonite</b> has the {{chemical}} composition of (Mg, Fe2+) Al2O4, {{putting it into}} a group of minerals known as the spinels, or the oxide spinels. The oxide spinels have a formula of the model AB2O4; where A is commonly Fe2+, Mg2+, or Mn2+, and B is Fe3+, Al3+, or Cr3+.|$|E

50|$|The <b>ceylonite</b> first {{discovered}} {{on the island}} of Ceylon, modern day Sri Lanka, was found imbedded in calcareous spar, and accompanied by pyrite and micas. The crystals were located in a low lying dried up river, and were relatively shallow in the soil; 8 to 10 inches. On one side of the bank a mass of gneiss was exposed, on the other, a graphic granite vein.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY. Chemical, optical, and X-ray {{data are}} {{presented}} for forsteritic olivine, bronzite-enstatite, diopsidic augite, anorthite, and spinel from ultramafic nodules at seven localities in Auckland pro-vince. Olivine has a composition range from FoT~- ~ for large primary crystals to Fos ~ for smaller interstitial grains. Orthopyroxenes (Ens 3 - 96) carry exsolution lamellae of clinopyroxene parallel to (too); clinopyroxenes are mainly diopsidic augites with exsolved bronzite. The plagioclase (An 97) has high-temperature characteristics and a lattice structure probably transitional between primitive and body-centred anorthite. Spinels include chromite, picotite, <b>ceylonite,</b> hercynite, and magnetite. Element distribution {{indicates that the}} ultramafic assemblages attained equilibrium at temperatures near I 250 ~ and at moderate pressures, corresponding tothe melting interval of anhydrous basaltic magmas within the uppermost mantle. AT seven localities in the Auckland province, listed in table I, ultramafie nodules are abundant inclusions in lava flows and dykes. In six of the occurrences the host rocks are Quaternary alkali olivine-basalts while the seventh is a Miocene olivine nephelinite at Arapohue. Descriptions of the fabrics and textures of these nodules have been given by Brothers and Rodgers (in press) and of the petrography and petrochemistry b...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY. Approximately forty, {{variously}} shaped, chromitite bodies {{occur in}} dunites and harz-burgites of the alpine-type peridotite complex of southern New Caledonia. The chromitites consist of pichrochromite (59 to 42 % Cr 203) and serpentinized olivine (Foge-a 2) and display {{a variety of}} textures (massive, disseminated, and orbicular) consistent with a magmatic cumulate origin. Dunites contain olivine (Foaz- 87) and I to 3 % picrochromite (50 to 39 % Cr~O 3). Harzburgites have less than 1 % spinel, ranging from picrochromite to <b>ceylonite</b> (45 to 28 % Cr 203) and often forming symplectic intergrowths with bronzite. Temperatures of crystallization f the cumulate picrochromites {{are believed to have}} been about I 2 oo ~ while the more aluminous symplectic spinels equilibrated under different conditions and may reflect a late stage recrystallization episode. THE New Caledonian ultramafic belt is an alpine-type, peridotite-gabbro-grano-diorite complex, which outcrops over the entire 500 km length of the archipelago as a series of spectacular, upstanding massifs and covers ome 41 % oftheislands ' urface of I 7 I 3 O km z. The southern portion of the largest, the Massif du Sud, consists predo-minantly of partially serpentinized harzburgite containing a cumulate dunite and eucrite core and intruded by felsic plutons. Chrome-rich spinels occur both as acces...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigated}} polymetamorphic peridotites occur {{associated with}} metabasic rocks in several complexes of probably Precambrian {{age in the}} northern part of the Hesperian massif (Iberian peninsula). Spinel-clinopyroxene-, spinel-pargasite-, spinel-hornblende- and chlorite-amphibole-peridotites, wehrlites, spinel-amphiboleand plagioclase wehrlites are found; most rocks are partly to completely serpentinized. Attention has been paid particularly to the two first-mentioned catazonal types in which bands, veins and lenses of garnet ± spinel pyroxenite and -pargasitite occur, while brown <b>ceylonite</b> orthopyroxenite and spinel-sensu-stricto clinopyroxenite are present in subordinate amounts. It is contended that these pyroxenites and pargasitites represent partial melting products of a parental ultramafic rock which contention is corroborated by experimental evidence. The partial melt had a picritic composition and crystallized as an aluminous pyroxene assemblage, in which garnet was formed under subsolidus conditions. Comparisons are drawn with peridotites from other occurrences in which garnet-bearing assemblages are also encountered. It is assumed that these peridotites were emplaced as spinel-clinopyroxene peridotites (Iherzolites) during a Precambrian orogenic cycle under high-pressure granulitefacies conditions and equilibrated at 1100 °- 1200 °C under 15 - 20 kb pressure. Catazonal retrogradation (800 °- 900 °C, 10 - 15 kb pressure) gave rise to large-scale development of pargasite. Garnet probably metastably coexisted with pargasite and the zonary character in the garnets was presumably obtained during this phase. Aluminous chlorite was formed during the Hercynian orogeny under mesozonal conditions; a second generation of pyroxenes and amphiboles possesses lower contents of Al 2 O 3. The spinel-hornblende peridotite probably did not undergo high-pressure granulite-facies conditions during the Precambrian orogeny. The chlorite-amphibole peridotite is supposed to have a lower Paleozoic age. The wehrlites are considered to be partial melting products of a parental peridotite and crystallized under low pressures. Spinel-amphibole wehrlites are hydrated plagioclase wehrlites. New whole-rock analyses of 11 peridotites and 14 pyroxenites are given. Contents of some minor and some trace elements have been determined with neutron activation analysis. Electron microprobe analyses are presented of olivines, pyroxenes, amphiboles, garnets, spinels, chlorites, högbomites and ilmenites. The mineral compositions are compared to whole-rock chemistry and distribution coefficients are calculated from which temperature and pressure estimates are derived...|$|E
