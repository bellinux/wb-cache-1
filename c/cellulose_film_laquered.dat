In this study, regenerated <b>cellulose</b> <b>films</b> with enhanced mechanical property were prepared via incorporating different plasticizers using ionic liquid 1 -allyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride (AmimCl) as the solvent. The characteristics of the <b>cellulose</b> <b>films</b> were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), thermal analysis (TG), X-ray diffraction (XRD), 13 C Solid-state cross-polarization/magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (CP/MAS NMR) and tensile testing.

This approach allows systematic molecular level detection and reveals the information of biobased materials’ inherent behaviour with nanosensitivity. The influence of structural features of <b>cellulose</b> <b>films</b> i. e. crystallinity, surface roughness and porosity on water interactions were clarified. <b>Cellulose</b> <b>films</b> were prepared using spin-coating and Langmuir-Schaefer deposition to obtain thin films of equal thickness, identical cellulose origin, simultaneously with different supramolecular structure. The uptake/release of water molecules and swelling were followed using QCM-D, and the structural {{features of the}} films were evaluated by AFM. More crystalline <b>cellulose</b> <b>film</b> possessed nanoporosity {{and as a consequence}} higher accessible surface area (more binding sites for water) and thus, it was capable tobind more water molecules in humid air and when immersed in water when compared to amorphous <b>cellulose</b> <b>film.</b> Due to the ordered structure, more crystalline <b>cellulose</b> <b>film</b> remained rigid and elastic although the water binding ability was more pronounced compared to amorphous film. Lower amount of bound water induced softening of the amorphous <b>cellulose</b> <b>film</b> and elastic layer became viscoelastic at high humidity. Finally, <b>cellulose</b> thin <b>films</b> were modified by adsorbing a layer of 1 -butyloxy- 2 -hydroxypropyl xylan, and the effect on moisture uptake was investigated.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{antimicrobial}} agent TMPAC (3 -(trimethoxysilyl) -propyldimethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride) on the cellulase activity oil model cellulose substrate was investigated by in situ-null ellipsometry. The cellulases used were extracted from Trichoderma virlde and Aspergillus niger, and the model <b>cellulose</b> <b>film</b> was prepared by spin-coating silicon oxide wafers with cellulose solubilized in N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide/dimethyl sulfoxide solution. Upon enzyme addition to the previously equilibrated <b>cellulose</b> <b>film,</b> the initial enzyme adsorption oil the substrate was followed by an overall decrease in film mass owing to enzymatic digestion of the cellulose. The loss of <b>cellulose</b> <b>film</b> mass {{was associated with a}} non-monotonously behavior of the <b>cellulose</b> <b>film</b> thickness.

The degradation rate with this cellulase decreased significantly when the <b>cellulose</b> <b>film</b> was treated with the antimicrobial agent. The antimicrobial agent did not affect the cellulose degradation catalyzed by the Aspergillus niger cellulase.

Investigations into the effect of nisin concentrations and contact times on incorporation of nisin into <b>cellulose</b> <b>films</b> showed that the lowest nisin concentration and shortest time needed for production of an effective antimicrobial <b>cellulose</b> <b>film</b> were 625 1 U ml(- 1) and 6 h, respectively. The active <b>cellulose</b> <b>films</b> produced under these conditions did not, however, significantly reduce L. monocytogenes populations on frankfurters (P > 0. 05) during refrigerated storage for 14 days as compared to the controls.
