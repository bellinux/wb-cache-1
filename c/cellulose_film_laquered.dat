In this study, regenerated <b>cellulose</b> <b>films</b> with enhanced mechanical property were prepared via incorporating different plasticizers using ionic liquid 1 -allyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride (AmimCl) as the solvent. The characteristics of the <b>cellulose</b> <b>films</b> were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), thermal analysis (TG), X-ray diffraction (XRD), 13 C Solid-state cross-polarization/magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (CP/MAS NMR) and tensile testing.

This approach allows systematic molecular level detection and reveals the information of biobased materialsâ€™ inherent behaviour with nanosensitivity. The influence of structural features of <b>cellulose</b> <b>films</b> i. e. crystallinity, surface roughness and porosity on water interactions were clarified. <b>Cellulose</b> <b>films</b> were prepared using spin-coating and Langmuir-Schaefer deposition to obtain thin films of equal thickness, identical cellulose origin, simultaneously with different supramolecular structure. The uptake/release of water molecules and swelling were followed using QCM-D, and the structural {{features of the}} films were evaluated by AFM. More crystalline <b>cellulose</b> <b>film</b> possessed nanoporosity {{and as a consequence}} higher accessible surface area (more binding sites for water) and thus, it was capable tobind more water molecules in humid air and when immersed in water when compared to amorphous <b>cellulose</b> <b>film.</b> Due to the ordered structure, more crystalline <b>cellulose</b> <b>film</b> remained rigid and elastic although the water binding ability was more pronounced compared to amorphous film. Lower amount of bound water induced softening of the amorphous <b>cellulose</b> <b>film</b> and elastic layer became viscoelastic at high humidity. Finally, <b>cellulose</b> thin <b>films</b> were modified by adsorbing a layer of 1 -butyloxy- 2 -hydroxypropyl xylan, and the effect on moisture uptake was investigated.

The cellulases used were extracted from Trichoderma virlde and Aspergillus niger, and the model <b>cellulose</b> <b>film</b> was prepared by spin-coating silicon oxide wafers with cellulose solubilized in N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide/dimethyl sulfoxide solution. Upon enzyme addition to the previously equilibrated <b>cellulose</b> <b>film,</b> the initial enzyme adsorption oil the substrate was followed by an overall decrease in film mass owing to enzymatic digestion of the cellulose. The loss of <b>cellulose</b> <b>film</b> mass {{was associated with a}} non-monotonously behavior of the <b>cellulose</b> <b>film</b> thickness.

Investigations into the effect of nisin concentrations and contact times on incorporation of nisin into <b>cellulose</b> <b>films</b> showed that the lowest nisin concentration and shortest time needed for production of an effective antimicrobial <b>cellulose</b> <b>film</b> were 625 1 U ml(- 1) and 6 h, respectively.
