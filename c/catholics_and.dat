5|$|The {{religious}} {{struggles of}} the 17th century left a deep sectarian division in Ireland. Religious allegiance now determined the perception in law of loyalty to the Irish King and Parliament. After {{the passing of the}} Test Act 1672, and with the victory of the forces of the dual monarchy of William and Mary over the Jacobites, Roman <b>Catholics</b> <b>and</b> nonconforming Protestant Dissenters were barred from sitting as members in the Irish Parliament. Under the emerging Penal Laws, Irish Roman <b>Catholics</b> <b>and</b> Dissenters were increasingly deprived of various and sundry civil rights even to the ownership of hereditary property. Additional regressive punitive legislation followed 1703, 1709 and 1728. This completed a comprehensive systemic effort to materially disadvantage Roman <b>Catholics</b> <b>and</b> Protestant Dissenters, while enriching a new ruling class of Anglican conformists. The new Anglo-Irish ruling class became known as the Protestant Ascendancy.|$|E

5|$|According to {{historian}} Thomas Paul, Tipu {{shifted his}} hatred for the British to the Mangalorean <b>Catholics</b> <b>and</b> other South Indian Christian communities.

5|$|During his lifetime, the Irish {{schools were}} not as {{successful}} as Smith had anticipated. He and others attributed this to the resentment shown by <b>Catholics,</b> <b>and</b> there was also resentment from those charged with sending Irish rent money to England's Christ's Hospital.|$|E

40|$|The anti-Christian {{attitudes and}} events that {{occurred}} during the late Qing Dynasty and the Republican era demonstrated that Chinese people still did not consistently accept the presence of Christianity in their country.

I use the media luminary Madonna {{as a case}} study to illustrate the inadequacy of much that <b>Catholic</b> <b>and</b> secular cultural critics have written about religiously ambiguous and sexually provocative popular culture phenomena. Typically, secular critics neglect the religious implications of such phenomena, while Catholic critics overlook their ideological implications.

5|$|Although {{previously}} favourable to the Crown, the Cavalier Parliament was alienated by the king's {{wars and}} religious policies during the 1670s.
