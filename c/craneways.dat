40|$|The most typical {{types of}} crane {{substructures}} destruction are wear of crane rails, details of its fixation, deformation of crane beams, settlement or tilting of the columns. At technical examination of {{buildings and structures}} with crane rails their planned-high-altitude position is determined. There exist a list of methods for determining the crane rails’ planned-high-altitude position, each of them has its disadvantage, expressed in the final result - the real position of crane rails. While estimating their position from the ground, i. e. mounting transit on the ground, and indicating devices above, there is an inaccuracy on the rails, which is caused by different moments of indications fixation, both on the plan and hightwise. The authors carried out observations {{of the position of}} <b>craneways</b> both on the plan and heightwise for determining the reason of <b>craneways</b> bearing structures’ deformations and the period of their influence of railtrack state. The results of these observations are analyzed and presented. The authors present their suggestions on advancing the crane operation, which will increase its operation life...|$|E

5000|$|The {{location}} {{changed over}} the years ending up at its last home at the Cow Palace in Daly City. In May 2004, Republican legislators in California—countering a move to outlaw gun shows at the Cow Palace—unsuccessfully sought to ban the ball as well. In 2010, the expo and ball relocated from the Cow Palace to the new <b>Craneway</b> Pavilion in Richmond, California. The move meant that instead of having 20,000 people, organizers would be limited to 14,000 attendees into the <b>Craneway</b> Pavilion on the Richmond waterfront over two days. [...] Organizers expected 7,500 attendees, but canceled the 2010 event the day before it was scheduled to occur, citing poor ticket sales and cost overruns.|$|R

The continued vision for site, to be housed inside the former Machine Shop building, is for a resident and tourist destination including a regional attraction and supporting retail uses. The Machine Shop building is temporarily dismantled and removed during site construction, while the former Pipe Shop and Coppersmiths Shop have been restored for retail use. The shipyard cranes have been restored and now tower over the development, one above Shipyard Plaza and one above <b>Craneway</b> Plaza. Signs and dioramas around the site tell {{the history of the}} former shipyard.|$|R
5000|$|Built in 1930 {{during the}} Great Depression, the {{assembly}} plant measures nearly 500,000 square feet (46,450 m²). The factory {{was a major}} stimulant to the local and regional economy and was an important development in Richmond's inner harbor and port plan. Ford became Richmond's third largest employer, behind Standard Oil and the Santa Fe Railroad. It is also an outstanding example of 20th-century industrial architecture designed by architect Albert Kahn, known for his [...] "daylight factory" [...] design, which employed extensive window openings that became his trademark. The main building is composed of a two-story section, a single-story section, a <b>craneway,</b> a boiler house and a shed canopy structure over the railroad track.|$|R

After seeing Wagener’s new {{suite of}} prints {{based on the idea}} of weaving, Loney agreed to write a poetic response. The {{resultant}} book, Loom, was collaboratively designed and published by David Pascoe, Nawakum Press, Santa Rosa, California and Richard Wagener, Mixolydian Editions, Petaluma, California. Craig Jensen at Booklab II in San Marcos, Texas did the binding. Loom had its debut at Codex Australia Book Fair held in Melbourne, March 2014. David Pascoe made a short film about the making of this book that focuses on Wagener, the engraver, Patrick Reagh, the printer, and Craig Jensen, the bookbinder.|$|R
5000|$|The {{city has}} 292.6 acre of parkland, that is 1.5% of the city's land territory. A new {{national}} park, Rosie the Riveter World War II Home Front National Historical Park {{is now under}} construction in the former Kaiser shipyards and other wartime industrial sites in Richmond. The park is a memorial to the six million women who labored on the home front, symbolized by the mythical figure [...] "Rosie the Riveter". Richmond was selected for the park because it has many intact buildings that were constructed for 56 wartime industries. Its four shipyards produced an amazing 747 large ships and set production records. The home front changed Richmond from a predominantly rural community of 23,600 residents to a diverse population of over 100,000 people within a year. Industries operated around the clock and public housing, schools, day care centers, health care and merchants mobilized to support the new workforce that arrived on the city's doorstep. Fortunately, Richmond's turbulent and productive home front years were well chronicled and photographed. The National Park Service provides interpretive services and operates a Visitor Center in the <b>craneway</b> of the Ford Assembly Building.|$|R
40|$|A study {{prepared}} for the Federal Ministry of the Interior by Bonnenberg + Drescher, Ingenieurgesellschaft mbH, Aldenhoven, entitled "Measures for Controlling External Impact Accidents in Research Reactors and Their Technical Support Structures" (SR 276) also contains engineering assessments of the behaviour of the FRJ- 2 under seismic loads. These lead to the conclusion "that {{the integrity of the}} plant {{does not seem to be}} guaranteed in every case after an earthquake" / 7, pp. 4 - 40 /. Very detailed finite element calculations have been carried out in order to verify this statement and the results indicate that displacement of approx. 5 mm occurring during a 0. 25 g safe shutdown earthquake for the reactor block both in the horizontal and vertical direction, as well as of approx. 16 mm for the <b>craneway</b> in the horizontal direction, do not endanger the primary circuit, The stresses only exceed the yield point in a few structural components (tube supports - row A of the experimental platform and tangential roof supports). In the case of the tube supports,however, the rupture point is also exceeded. In view of the fact that the present computations involve a number of conservatismsand that the DIDO design contains safety reserves, it can be assumed that the integrity of the primary circuit will remain ensured. More extensive studies of earthquake behaviour are therefore not considered to be necessary...|$|R
50|$|The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad had its {{terminus}} at Richmond. The first {{post office}} opened in 1900. Richmond was founded and incorporated in 1905, {{carved out of}} Rancho San Pablo, from which {{the nearby town of}} San Pablo inherited its name. Until the enactment of prohibition in 1919, the city had the largest winery in the world; the small abandoned village of Winehaven remains fenced off along Western Drive in the Point Molate Area. In the 1920s the Ku Klux Klan was active in the city. In 1930 the Ford Motor Company opened an assembly plant called Richmond Assembly Plant which moved to Milpitas in the 1960s. The old Ford plant has been a National Historic Place since 1988, and in 2004 was purchased by developer Eddie Orton and has been converted into an events center (Ford Point Building - The <b>Craneway).</b> The city was a small town at that time, until the onset of World War II which brought on a rush of migrants and a boom in the industrial sector. Standard Oil set up operations here in 1901, including a what is now the Chevron Richmond Refinery and tank farm, which are still operated by Chevron. There is a pier into San Francisco Bay south of Point Molate for oil tankers. The western terminus of the Santa Fe Railroad was established in Richmond with ferry connections at Ferry Point in the Brickyard Cove area of Point Richmond to San Francisco. At the outset of World War II, the four Richmond Shipyards were built along the Richmond waterfront, employing thousands of workers, many recruited from all over the United States, including many African-Americans and women entering the workforce for the first time. Many of these workers lived in specially constructed houses scattered throughout the San Francisco Bay Area, including Richmond, Berkeley and Albany. A specially built rail line, the Shipyard Railway, transported workers to the shipyards. Kaiser's Richmond shipyards built 747 Victory and Liberty ships for the war effort, more than any other site in the U.S. The city broke many records and even built one Liberty ship in a record five days. On average the yards could build a ship in thirty days. The medical system established for the shipyard workers at the Richmond Field Hospital eventually became today's Kaiser Permanente HMO. It remained in operation until 1993 when it was replaced by the modern Richmond Medical Center hospital, that has subsequently expanded to a large multiple building campus.|$|R
