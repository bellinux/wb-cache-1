50|$|In 2001 Thomas Murray, the <b>custody</b> <b>fees,</b> {{ratings and}} {{research}} group and Global Custodian {{agreed to work}} together {{with the aim of}} creating the most comprehensive and robust analysis of {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} custodian banks globally. The goal was to combine the research-based analyses, owned by Thomas Murray, of major custodial providers and CSDs, with the pre-eminent surveys of custodian bank client perceptions owned by the Global Custodian.|$|E
40|$|This paper re-examines the {{determinants}} of mutual fund fees paid by mutual fund shareholders for management costs and other expenses. There are two novelties with respect to previous studies. First, each type of fee is explained separately. Second, the paper employs a new dataset consisting of Spanish mutual funds, making it the second paper to study mutual fund fees outside the US market. Furthermore, the Spanish market has three interesting characteristics: (i) both distribution and management are highly dominated by banks and savings banks, which points towards potential conflicts of interest; (ii) Spanish mutual fund law imposes caps on all types of fees; and (iii) Spain ranks first in terms of average mutual fund fees among similar countries. We find significant differences in mutual fund fees not explained by the fund’s investment objective. For instance, management companies owned by banks and savings banks charge higher management fees and redemption fees to nonguaranteed funds. Also, investors in older non-guaranteed funds and non-guaranteed funds with a lower average investment {{are more likely to}} end up paying higher management fees. Moreover, there is clear evidence that some mutual funds enjoy better conditions from custodial institutions than others. In contrast to evidence from the US market, larger funds are not associated with lower fees, but with higher <b>custody</b> <b>fees</b> for guaranteed funds and higher redemption fees for both types of funds. Finally, fee-setting by mutual funds is not related to fund before-fee performance. mutual fund, fee caps, censored data...|$|E
50|$|Hales {{was sworn}} into the privy council, and {{appointed}} {{one of the}} lords of the admiralty, deputy-warden of the Cinque ports, and lieutenant of Dover Castle, and in June 1687 Lieutenant of the Tower of London. Narcissus Luttrell mentions, in June 1688, a rumour {{that he was about}} to have a Catholic chapel in the Tower. When the seven bishops were discharged from his <b>custody</b> he demanded <b>fees</b> of them; but they refused, on the ground that their detention and Hales's commission were both illegal. The lieutenant hinted that if they came into his hands again they should feel his power.|$|R

5000|$|By {{letters patent}} from John, King of England, the {{prescriptive}} barony was granted to Walter de Lacy and his heirs in perpetuity in 1208. The grant describes {{the scope of}} administrative responsibility, {{and the limits of}} powers delegated: [...] "Grant and confirmation to Walter de Lascy, on his petition, of his land of Meath; to hold of the King in fee by the service of 50 knights; and of his fees of Fingal, in the vale of Dublin; to hold in fee by the service of 7 knights; saving to the King pleas of the Crown, appeals of the peace, & c., and crociae, and the dignities thereto belonging; the King’s writs to run throughout Walter’s land.

5000|$|In Ireland, most originally-feudal titular baronies {{have long}} {{disappeared}} through obsolescence or disuse. The Lordship of Fingal was granted to Walter de Lacy, Lord of Meath for seven knight's fees, [...] "although the lords thereof hold elsewhere in capite", {{according to the}} unusual grant in 1208 by King John as Lord of Ireland, who allowed de Lacy to retain <b>custody</b> of his <b>fees.</b> [...] Fingal at the time spread from the River Liffey to the River Delvin, north of Dublin, similar to the administrative boundary of today's County Fingal (minus Dublin City) created from part of County Dublin in 1994. A small number of other titular baronies also continued to exist either as submerged titles {{of members of the}} Peerages of Ireland, Great Britain or the United Kingdom, or as titles held by grand serjeanty, such as, originally, Fingal. Those few that thus survive at all are traditionally considered [...] "incorporeal hereditaments", and may continue to exist as interests or estates in land, registrable as such upon conveyance or inheritance under the Registry of Deeds of the Government of Ireland, although increasingly these are seen today as titles held in gross as personal rights, and not as real interests in land.|$|R
