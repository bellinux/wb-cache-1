The experimental design included 18 <b>kiln</b> <b>charges</b> with three replications of three kiln schedules. Nine of the <b>kiln</b> <b>charges</b> were restrained and nine were unrestrained. Kiln schedules were high-temperature [240 / F (116 / C) dry bulb with no venting or steam spray], elevated [190 - 220 / F (88 - 104 / C) dry bulb and 190 - 165 / F (88 - 74 / C) wet bulb], and conventional [180 / F (82 / C) dry bulb and 170 - 145 / F (77 - 63 / C) wet bulb]. Restraint loading was 200 {{pounds per square}} foot (psf) (976 kg/m 2). Results showed that the high-temperature schedule consumed approximately one-third and one-half of {{the energy of the}} elevated and conventional schedules, respectively. In addition, drying time averaged 21. 1 hours with the high-temperature schedule, 42. 0 hours with the elevated schedule, and 50. 3 hours with the conventional schedule. Although there were several significant differences in bow, crook, and twist in lumber dried by the three schedules, no schedule showed significantly lower warp. Results also showed that restraint reduced warp in lumber in the high-temperature and elevated schedules, and much of the warp reduction was in lumber within the top six courses of the stack. In addition, restraint reduced the variance of warp in lumber dried by all three schedules...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 Volatile organic {{emissions}} (VOCs) {{from the}} kiln drying of lumber are {{of concern to}} government, research agencies, and the forest products industry. In the Pacific Northwest, neither the quantity of VOC emissions from kilns drying Douglas-fir is available, nor the effects of drying schedule and lumber-related characteristics on the emissions.

5000|$|High process {{temperatures}} {{are required to}} convert the raw material mix to Portland cement clinker. <b>Kiln</b> <b>charge</b> temperatures in the sintering zone of rotary kilns range at around 1450 °C. To reach these, flame temperatures of about 2000 °C are necessary. For reasons of clinker quality the burning process takes place under oxidising conditions, under which the partial oxidation of the molecular nitrogen in the combustion air resulting {{in the formation of}} nitrogen monoxide (NO) dominates. This reaction is also called thermal NO formation. At the lower temperatures prevailing in a precalciner, however, thermal NO formation is negligible: here, the nitrogen bound in the fuel can result in the formation of what is known as fuel-related NO.

5000|$|Portland {{cement clinker}} was first made (in 1825) in a {{modified}} {{form of the}} traditional static lime kiln. [...] The basic, egg-cup shaped lime kiln was provided with a conical or beehive shaped extension to increase draught and thus obtain the higher temperature needed to make cement clinker. For nearly half a century, this design, and minor modifications, remained the only method of manufacture. The kiln was restricted in size by {{the strength of the}} chunks of rawmix: if the <b>charge</b> in the <b>kiln</b> collapsed under its own weight, the kiln would be extinguished. For this reason, beehive kilns never made more than 30 tonnes of clinker per batch. A batch took one week to turn around: a day to fill the kiln, three days to burn off, two days to cool, and a day to unload. Thus, a kiln would produce about 1500 tonnes per year.|$|R

It was tested during the drying of three <b>kiln</b> <b>charges</b> of 2 by 8 -inch Douglas fir in an experi-mental kiln by checking the corrected readings against moisture contents determined by the oven-drying method. By using the chart and spring-loaded electrodes with an electric moisture meter, the moisture content after the first 24 hours of drying can be followed continuously throughout the drying period.

30|$|Understanding {{the final}} MC {{distribution}} {{is very important}} in the probabilistic analysis, because classical parametric statistics {{is based on the assumption}} of a specific probabilistic distribution. Rice and Shepard [1] extensively measured the MC of about 3500 eastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.) lumbers from 14 <b>kiln</b> <b>charges</b> that were dried in 7 sawmills. Substantial MC variation existed within a given <b>charge</b> and between <b>kilns</b> at each sawmill, and most of the MC distributions were found to be different from Normal distribution. Milota et al. [7] calculated the final MC distribution of mixed hem-fir species and mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana) using a computer simulation, and showed that a number of slowly drying boards tended to skew the MC distribution toward the right. Tenori and Moya [8] and Moya et al. [9] statistically evaluated a variability in the final MC of kiln-dried lumber from plantations in Costa Rica. In the statistical analysis, the normality assumption was assessed, and positive skewness was found in the distribution [9]. The factors affecting the variability in the final MC of kiln-dried lumber was also examined using Pearson’s correlation matrix [10] and general linear model [11], assuming that the final MC follows a Normal distribution. Numerical stochastic models have been intensively developed to simulate the MC dispersion during and after conventional drying [12, 13] and radio-frequency vacuum drying [14 – 16]. The developed stochastic models could be used to reproduce the final MC distributions, and some of the simulated distributions had a long right tail [12, 14]. The results of the above studies indicate that the final MC does not necessarily follow a normal distribution. However, as far as we know, a comprehensive evaluation of the final MC in relation to probabilistic distribution has not been carried out. Moreover, the final MC data have been assessed using only descriptive statistics, such as mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and the percentage of the population whose MC is within or without the target MC range. The inference of these parameters has not been attempted at all, which means that no uncertainty assessment of the final MC has been carried out. Therefore, establishing a probabilistic evaluation method of the final MC is an important research endeavor.|$|R

The model incorporates mass and heat transfer relationships within the lumber stack, as well as thermodynamic properties of the wood and drying air. It takes into account a change of air properties along the stack {{and its effect on}} the mass and heat transfer parameters. Kiln and individual board properties as well as a drying schedule are the input parameters that are defined and entered by a user. The model relies on the drying rate functions which are empirical correlations based on single-board tests. The drying rate function for hemlock was obtained based on experiment results from 23 small charges dried over a range of conditions used in industry. Three larger batches of hemlock were also dried using three different industrial schedules. The change of average moisture content with time predicted by the model was verified by weighing a <b>kiln</b> <b>charge</b> with load cells during drying. The change of board temperatures and temperature drop along the stack were verified by measuring the actual temperatures in the kiln during drying. The model was first validated against data available in the literature.

Validated variables for both cases were board temperatures, temperature drop through the package and average moisture content of the package...|$|R
40|$|This project {{contains}} {{research in}} the disciplines of wood drying and preservation. It first explored two different avenues for possible improvement in the drying stage of sawn timber production and then studied a novel pre-conditioning method for preservative treatment of radiata pine. The first avenue of investigation for improving drying was the sorting the green timber into more uniform charges for drying usina the large and consistent difference between heartwood and sapwood moisture content. The impetus for this arose {{from the results of}} a preliminary mill-based study of moisture content variation within a typical <b>kiln</b> <b>charge</b> of mixed radiata pine heartwood and sapwood. Green density can be quickly and easily determined from scanned board volume and loadcell-derived board weight and was found to be closely correlated to average board MC and heartwood/sapwood content. Green density was a very good predictor of wood % saturation also. Although little used here in Australia, such a sorting system has potential to improve efficiency in the drying and conditioning stages of radiata pine sawn timber production. Pre-drying treatments (i. e. pressure-steaming and pre-steaming) to improve permeability and drying speed in radiata pine were examined as the second avenue for possible improvement in drying efficiency. The effects of these pre-treatments on drying parameters including measured radial permeability were assessed. Pressure-steaming (a preconditioning. method to improve permeability of radiata pine heartwood for preservation) rendered the wood highly susceptible to checking during drying, resulting in severe degrade. Pressure-steaming also appeared to retard drying rates, especially in the sapwood [...] a phenomenon contrary to the significant improvements to permeability found in the wood samples subjected to this pre-treatment. Pre-steaming at 100 C for 4 hours prior to drying was found to be only of marginal benefit to permeability and drying rates, although its use is necessary for drying heart-in studs and reducing early surface checking. The second part of the project tested the application microwave energy as a novel alternative pre-conditioning method to pressure-steaming for preservation treatment of radiata pine. The microwave pre-conditioning caused very rapid drying of the wood (especially the heartwood) and significantly increased the uptake of preservative solution. However, the distribution of preservative was variable compared with that in wood which had been pressure-steam conditioned. Complete and even preservative distribution was achievable only in wood which had been microwave pre-conditioned for longer time periods at high intensity irradiation. These conditions also resulted in severe checking of the wood and excessive use of preservative solution. The effects on the structure of the wood were somewhat different to those of pressure-steaming in that increased permeability and ease of preservative penetration were facilitated by visible checks of various sizes whereas with pressure-steaming, the wood was altered at the microstructural level, by destroying the soft contents of the rays and thereby significantly increasing permeability in the radial direction. The important conclusions from the study were: (a) There is considerable scope for developing and applying simple but effective pre-drying sorting of green sawn radiata pine to generate greater- uniformity in drying charges and better tailor drying schedules to their specific requirements. This would lead to improved drying efficiency and reduced degrade. (b) Contrary to initial expectations, pressure-steaming is a pre-conditioning method suited to preservation but not to drying, as demonstrated by the retarded drying and severe degrade in pressure-steamed wood samples. (c) Microwave pre-conditioning for preservation treatment of radiata pine has considerable advantages over pressure-steaming in terms of rapidity of drying and deserves further consideration and development. The microwave processing conditions used in this study yielded variable results, demonstrating that much further research is required to optimise the microwave processing conditions to better suit radiata pine.

40|$|The present {{investigations}} have been initiated with {{the object of}} studying the air circulation and relation between • the air movement and the drying of the timber in timber seasoning kilns. The work has been divided into five separate experiments, {{each of which is}} summarised separately as follows :- Experiment 1 - The Measurement of the Flow of Air Through 'Timber Stacks. - A method of measuring the air velocity through timber stacks by means of vane anemometer p has been established. Correction factors, which, for ar 49 ne size and type of anemometer depend on the thickness of the timber and of the separating strips, on the velocity, and on the position in which the anemometer is held, have been determined for a number of cases. These have been plotted against record- ed anemometer readings on a number of graphs. Experiment 2 - The Effect of the Rate of Air Circulation on the rate of Drying. - A number of kiln runs has been made with narrow stacks of matched material using the same temperature and humidity in each run but different rates of air circulation. The object has been to determine the effect of the rate of air circulation on the rate of drying timber apart from the question of change of drying rate from one side of a wide stack to the other due to fall in temperature and increase in humidity of the air. The results indicate that with the same air conditions the rate of drying is independent of the rate of air flow provided that this rate is greater than some minimum value which is probably in most cases less -than 140 feet per minute. Experiment 3 - The Relation Between the Quantity of Air Circulate* and the La in Dr in From the Enterin to the Leaving Air Side of a <b>Kiln</b> <b>Charge</b> of Timber. - A number of tests has been carried out in an experimental kiln to determine the change in air conditions and the lag in the drying rate from the entering to the leaving air side of a stack of timber 5 feet wide. Different sized separating strips and different quantities of circulating air have been used. The theoretical relation between the quantity of air circulated, the amount of moisture evapdrated, and the change in air conditions has also been established; the results so calculated have been compared with those determined experimentally. Experiment 4 - The Relation Between Air Flow and Fall in Pressure Across a Timber Stack. - The flow of air through a rectangular duct consisting of boards and separating strips and similar to the openings through a timber stack has been investigated. Curves showing the relation between static pressure change and rate of flow have been prepared for different sized strips and for board surfaces of different degrees of roughness. Equations for the pressure loss during flow through the duct and for the entrance pressure loss have been determined. Experiment 5 - The Effect of Various Features of Kiln Design on the distribution of the Air over the Side of a Stack of Timber in a Commercial Kiln. - A series of tests has been carried out in commercial kilns of the cross shaft internal fan type to determine the effect of various distances between the kiln walls and the sides of the stack on the distribution of the circulating air {{over the side of the}} stack The results of the tests are shown diagrammatically. The conclusion:: is reached that the 16 inch wide space commonly adopted for the particular design of kiln tested is reasonably satisfactory although more comprehensive tests on an experimental kiln of commercial proportions appear desirable...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{energy storage}} (TES) is an {{integral}} part of a concentrated solar power (CSP) system. It enables plant operators to generate electricity beyond on sun hours and supply power to the grid to meet peak demand. Current CSP sensible heat storage systems employ molten salts as both the heat transfer fluid and the heat storage media. These systems have an upper operating temperature limit of around 400 C. Future TES systems are expected to operate at temperatures between 600 C to 1000 C for higher thermal efficiencies which should result in lower electricity cost. To meet future operating temperature and electricity cost requirements, a TES concept utilizing thermochemical cycles (TCs) based on multivalent solid oxides was proposed. The system employs a pair of reduction and oxidation (REDOX) reactions to store and release heat. In the storage step, hot air from the solar receiver is used to reduce the oxidation state of an oxide cation, e. g. Fe 3 + to Fe 2 +. Heat energy is thus stored as chemical bonds and the oxide is charged. To discharge the stored energy, the reduced oxide is re-oxidized in air and heat is released. Air is used as both the heat transfer fluid and reactant and no storage of fluid is needed. This project investigated the engineering and economic feasibility of this proposed TES concept. The DOE storage cost and LCOE targets are $ 15 /kWh and $ 0. 09 /kWh respectively. Sixteen pure oxide cycles were identified through thermodynamic calculations and literature information. Data showed the kinetics of re-oxidation of the various oxides to be a key barrier to implementing the proposed concept. A down selection was carried out based on operating temperature, materials costs and preliminary laboratory measurements. Cobalt oxide, manganese oxide and barium oxide were selected for developmental studies to improve their REDOX reaction kinetics. A novel approach utilizing mixed oxides to improve the REDOX kinetics of the selected oxides was proposed. It partially replaces some of the primary oxide cations with selected secondary cations. This causes a lattice charge imbalance and increases the anion vacancy density. Such vacancies enhance the ionic mass transport and lead to faster re-oxidation. Reoxidation fractions of Mn 3 O 4 to Mn 2 O 3 and CoO to Co 3 O 4 were improved by up to 16 fold through the addition of a secondary oxide. However, no improvement was obtained in barium based mixed oxides. In addition to enhancing the short term re-oxidation kinetics, it was found that the use of mixed oxides also help to stabilize or even improve the TES properties after long term thermal cycling. Part of this improvement could be attributed to a reduced grain size in the mixed oxides. Based on the measurement results, manganese-iron, cobalt-aluminum and cobalt iron mixed oxides have been proposed for future engineering scale demonstration. Using the cobalt and manganese mixed oxides, we were able to demonstrate charge and discharge of the TES media in both a bench top fixed bed and a rotary kiln-moving bed reactor. Operations of the fixed bed configuration are straight forward but require a large mass flow rate and higher fluid temperature for <b>charging.</b> The rotary <b>kiln</b> makes direct solar irradiation possible and provides significantly better heat transfer, but designs to transport the TES oxide in and out of the reactor will need to be defined. The final reactor and system design will have to be based on the economics of the CSP plant. A materials compatibility study was also conducted and it identified Inconel 625 as a suitable high temperature engineering material to construct a reactor holding either cobalt or manganese mixed oxides. To assess the economics of such a CSP plant, a packed bed reactor model was established as a baseline. Measured cobalt-aluminum oxide reaction kinetics were applied to the model and the influences of bed properties and process parameters on the overall system design were investigated. The optimal TES system design was found to be a network of eight fixed bed reactors at 18. 75 MWth each with charge and discharge temperatures between 1200 C and 600 C, which provides a constant output temperature of 900 C. The charge and discharge time are 8 hours each respectively. This design was integrated into a process flowsheet of a CSP plant and the system's economics were determined using AspenPlus and NREL's Solar Advisory Model. Storage cost is very sensitive to materials cost and was calculated to be based around $ 40 /kWh for cobalt based mixed oxide. It can potentially decrease to $ 10 /kWh based on reduced materials cost on a bulk scale. The corresponding calculated LCOE was between $ 0. 22 and 0. 30 /kW-h. The high LCOE is a result of the high charging temperature required in this first design and the cost of cobalt oxide. It is expected that a moving bed reactor using manganese oxide will significantly improve the economics of the proposed concept...|$|R
