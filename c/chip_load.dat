40|$|Identifying the {{situation}} of grinding wheel wear and loading {{is a very important}} issue for high efficiency grinding operations. This paper presents a new method that detects and identifies the <b>chip</b> <b>loading</b> and cutting edge wear of a grinding wheel using the image processing toolbox of MATLAB. The different optical characters of the metal chips and the abrasive grains are analysed. The Sobel operator is adopted to make edge detection. A sensitivity threshold based on the global condition is used to decrease the noise. Image dilation and erosion processes are used to ensure the edge of each <b>loaded</b> <b>chip</b> is covered by a continuous section. The ratios of chips are calculated and displayed to monitor the wheel surface working status...|$|R
5000|$|When {{deciding}} what feed rate {{to use for}} a certain cutting operation, the calculation is fairly straightforward for single-point cutting tools, {{because all of the}} cutting work is done at one point (done by [...] "one tooth", as it were). With a milling machine or jointer, where multi-tipped/multi-fluted cutting tools are involved, then the desirable feed rate becomes dependent on the number of teeth on the cutter, as well as the desired amount of material per tooth to cut (expressed as <b>chip</b> <b>load).</b> The greater the number of cutting edges, the higher the feed rate permissible: for a cutting edge to work efficiently it must remove sufficient material to cut rather than rub; it also must do its fair share of work.|$|E
5000|$|Cold {{saw blades}} are {{circular}} metal cutting saw blades categorized into two types: solid HSS or tungsten carbide-tipped (TCT). Both types of blades are resharpenable {{and may be}} used many times before being discarded. Cold saw blades are used to cut metal using a relatively slow rotational speed, usually less than 5000 surface feet per minute (SFM) (25m/s), and a high <b>chip</b> <b>load</b> per tooth, usually between [...]001" [...] - [...]003" [...] (0.025 - 0.08mm) per tooth. These blades are driven by a high power motor and high-torque gear reduction unit or an AC vector drive. During the cutting process, the metal is released in a shearing action by the teeth as the blade turns and the feed mechanism moves the blade forward. They are called [...] "cold saw blades" [...] because they transfer all the energy and heat created during the cutting process to the chip. This enables the blade and the work material to remain cold.|$|E
50|$|The {{second type}} of cold saw blade, {{tungsten}} carbide-tipped (TCT), are made with an alloy steel body and tungsten carbide inserts brazed to {{the tips of the}} teeth. These tips are ground on all surfaces to create tangential and radial clearance and provide the proper cutting and clearance angles on the teeth. The alloy body is generally made from a wear-resistant material such as a chrome vanadium steel, heat treated to 38/42 HRC. The tungsten carbide tips are capable of operating at much higher temperatures than solid HSS, therefore, TCT saw blades are usually run at much higher surface speeds. This allows carbide-tipped blades to cut at faster rates and still maintain an acceptable <b>chip</b> <b>load</b> per tooth. These blades are commonly used for cutting non-ferrous alloys, but have gained significant popularity for ferrous metal cutting applications in the last 10 years. The tungsten carbide inserts are extremely hard (98 HRC) and capable of very long wear life. However, they are less resistant to shock than solid HSS cold saw blades. Any vibration during the cutting process may severely damage the teeth. These cold saw blades need to be driven by a backlash free gear box and a constant feed mechanism like a ball-screw feed.|$|E

The fracture progresses stably until surface effects alter the crack trajectory to form a chip. The latter conclusively occurs from the top surface if ϕ > β while from the side wall if ϕ < β. The fracture load for top-surface spalling scales with w^(1 / 2), where w is the indentation depth, and it monotonically declines with the offset angle ψ ≡ - ϕβ, that for side-wall chipping scales with h^(1 / 2) and it is little sensitive to ϕ for moderate values of θ In both the cases, the <b>chipping</b> <b>load</b> increases with β.

The surface roughness, Ra, was less than 100 nm but the Ra/Rz ratio ranged from 0. 03 - 0. 12. The surface roughness was found to improve with increasing width of cut {{and to a lesser}} extent with increasing feed rate. A single pass of the end-mill was found to produce a smoother surface than two passes over the same surface. The surface roughness was found to correspond to the diameter of the end mill and the slope of the secondary cutting edge. To reduce the surface roughness, smaller diameter end mills and <b>chip</b> <b>loads</b> should be used...|$|R
40|$|Now curved {{cutting edge}} mills are widely used. A {{section of the}} cutting layer (<b>chip</b> <b>load),</b> when using such mill, is a {{curvilinear}} polygon, usually, limited to four curves. Thus, a size of the taken chip is various for different points of the cutting edge. There {{are a lot of}} analytical and empirical relationships to calculate a cutting force. However, they cannot be used for this purpose with a variable <b>chip</b> <b>load</b> thickness. The Sandvik company wavy cutting edge mill Preci Tool 166205 (a mill diameter d = 10 mm; the teeth number z = 4) with the milling width d/ 2 and feed per tooth Sz = 0. 042 mm/tooth was used as a model object. To calculate a cutting force the formula c 1. 1 m k P A a  was used where A, a are the <b>chip</b> <b>load</b> area and thickness; kс 1. 1 is the specific cutting force (for steel kс 1. 1 = 2000 N/mm 2); m is coefficient (for steel m = 0. 26). For calculating a cutting force in case of the curved <b>chip</b> <b>load</b> four techniques were used. They were distinguished by a way of splitting the <b>chip</b> <b>load</b> into sectors and defining its thickness. 1. Splitting the <b>chip</b> <b>load</b> into the sectors, which are limited on two sides to curves, and on two other sides to converging straight lines, perpendicular to a trace of the cutting edge, allowed to calculate theoretically correct cutting force. It is shown that with increasing number of splitting sectors a cutting force a little decreases, and then is stabilized at the level of 160. 5 N. This value can be considered to be the valid cutting force arising when there is a curved <b>chip</b> <b>load.</b> 2. When splitting the <b>chip</b> <b>load</b> into trapezes a cutting force increases with increasing number of splitting segments and tends to the value of 165. 5 N. Replacing the curved sectors with trapezes enables an error in cutting force calculation to be 3. 1 %. Such error allows us to claim that for engineering calculations it is admissible to make the specified simplification. 3. For simplification of measurements and calculations of cutting force it was offered to make splitting the <b>chip</b> <b>load</b> by the lines located radially with respect to the mill (perpendicular to the mill axis). The cutting force calculated for such way of splitting essentially does not depend on the number splitting segments (change of force values was at most 0. 2 %). An error of determined cutting force thus is 1. 5 % that allows us to draw a conclusion that radial splitting can be used for calculation of cutting force with curved <b>chip</b> <b>load.</b> 4. The integrated calculation of cutting force for the <b>chip</b> <b>load</b> area and width or a trace length of the cutting edge give an error rate of 5 and 7 % (168, 3 N and 172 N), respectively, that allows to recommend such calculations only as integrated, preliminary. </p...|$|E

40|$|Now {{that there}} is a need to {{increase}} a processing capacity, curved cutting edge mills find ever-growing use. Also known as “rough end”, “full-side”, and “heavy-duty” mills, they provide the increased depth and width values of milling owing to the width-sized chip separation. The analysis of produced mills allowed us both to reveal their basic design components (type of a shaft or basic opening, diameter and length of the cutting part, mill length, quantity of teeth, a tilt angle of a screw flute) and to make their classification. The paper presents a classification of the profile types of cutting edges, which can be divided by form (flat, round), size (small, large, super-large), and symmetry (symmetrical and asymmetrical). The profile of the cutting edge is characterized by the following parameters: profile height, pitch of crests spherical radius of crest. A review of the curved cutting edge profile types allows us to build the geometrical constructions to define a form and the sizes of the <b>chip</b> <b>load</b> made by the cutting edge from a billet. It is shown that parameters of the cutting edge profile influence the form and the sizes (thickness and width) of the <b>chip</b> <b>load.</b> The <b>chip</b> <b>load</b> thickness provided by the curved cutting edge mills exceeds that of observed when using the “smooth” cutting edge mills. A thickening degree of the <b>chip</b> <b>load</b> is changed with changing form and sizes of the cutting edge mill profile. Larger thickening is observed if the <b>chip</b> <b>load</b> is limited from below and from above by the marks of a single tooth (the first or second etc.), and a length of the other teeth marks is minimum. The most achievable <b>chip</b> <b>load</b> thickness is equal to feed per revolution. Studying the references allowed us to formulate some rules to choose a cutting edge profile depending on a type of the processed material and a desirable roughness of the processed surface. It is important to note the following. When choosing a profile of the cutting edge it is possible to be guided by the rule: as a hardness of the processed material increases and a desirable roughness of the processed surface decreases it is necessary to use mills with a profile of the smaller height and pitch. </p...|$|E

40|$|Micro-end-milling is {{emerging}} as an important fabrication process. Its benefits include the ability to fabricate micro and meso-scale parts out of a greater range of materials and with more varied geometry than is possible with lithography and etching. It also enables the creation of micro and meso-scale molds for injection molding. Factors affecting surface roughness have not been studied in depth for this process. A series of experiments has been conducted in order to begin to characterize the factors affecting surface roughness and determine the range of attainable surface roughness values for the micro-end-milling process. A 229 ?m diameter end mill was used to cut slots into aluminum (6061) samples. The machining factors studied were <b>chip</b> <b>load</b> (feed per tooth), cutting speed, and depth of cut. A two level factorial experiment was run, and {{it was determined that}} while <b>chip</b> <b>load</b> was the dominating factor, the interaction between <b>chip</b> <b>load</b> and cutting speed was also significant. Further experiments allowed the generation of a second order relationship between <b>chip</b> <b>load</b> and surface roughness. The model, which includes the effect of <b>chip</b> <b>load,</b> cutting speed, and the interaction between the two, predicted the surface roughness values with an accuracy of about +/- 10 %. The surface roughness values ranged from 600 Å all the way to 3800 Å over the span of the studied parameters. It has previously been shown that run-out creates a greater problem for the dimensional accuracy of parts created by a micro-end-milling process as compared to parts created by a traditional end-milling process (Lee, et al 2001). It appears that run-out also has a more significant effect on the surface quality of micro-end milled parts. The surface roughness traces reveal large peak to valley variations with a period of twice the <b>chip</b> <b>load.</b> This means that one of the two cutting edges on the tool creates a deeper cut than the other. Cutting marks from the non-dominant cutting edge are also visible on the surface roughness traces as small steps between the much larger marks from the dominant cutting edge. It is postulated that the effect is due to run-out, and that improving machine tool run-out will have a very significant effect on the surface quality of micro-end-milled features...|$|E

40|$|The aim in {{this thesis}} is the {{investigation}} of the cutting forces during a dry milling machining process. An experimental design was developed and the cutting forces were measured based on the cutting input parameters. The cutting forces? signatures are in good agreement with the metal cutting mechanics where effects of the tool run out and vibrations are observed. A parametric study has been conducted and the results show that the magnitude of the cutting forces at a constant depth of cut increases with a high feed rate and a low spindle speed. These results suggest that the cutting forces depend on the <b>chip</b> <b>load</b> at a constant depth of cut. Also, the increase of the depth of cut generates higher force magnitude due to the volume of material removed. A three-dimensional Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was conducted using commercial FEA software ABAQUS to predict the cutting forces in a dry milling cutting process. Different cutting input parameters were chosen to predict the cutting forces. The findings show that the predicted cutting forces depend also on the <b>chip</b> <b>load.</b> Later, a close fit has been found from the comparison of the measured and predicted cutting forces. Thus, the FEA model is valid and accurate. The surface roughness (Ra) was also studied based on different cutting input parameters and CNC machine quality. The results from the investigation show that the surface roughness depends on the <b>chip</b> <b>load</b> and the machine condition. This leads to conclude that the surface roughness can be predicted based on the cutting forces? signatures...|$|E
