40|$|Social life, besides its {{advantages}} involves major negative effects, since the intensive contacts among individuals {{can contribute to}} the fast spread of pathogens. Further on, social activities and lifestyle can lead to the accumulation of waste materials in high amounts, among which corpses are the most important components. The accumulation of wastes inside a nest can promote the establishment of pathogen microorganisms and fungi, therefore waste management, although essential for the colony's survival, represents risk for the performing workers due to the increased probability of getting infected. In order to counterbalance these negative effects, many social defensive mechanisms have evolved, from which the most effective one is the disposal <b>of</b> <b>corpses</b> on waste piles, i. e. the formation <b>of</b> cemeteries. The <b>corpses</b> can also be used as food source mainly by ant species. The consumption of insect remnants, including those of other ant species, is a widespread phenomenon among ants. Corpse cannibalism is mentioned only in a few works, but it seems that the corpses that appear inside the nest or during a battle can be consumed as food. Some recent researches also highlighted the use <b>of</b> <b>corpses</b> during interspecific conflicts; the appearance <b>of</b> <b>corpses</b> can have negative effects on the behavior of the attacked colony. This behavior let us hypothesize that ants are able to recognize the <b>corpses</b> <b>of</b> different species, and react appropriately. Thus, <b>corpses</b> <b>of</b> different origin may have important signal properties. Aims In our study, we investigated (1) the response of different Formica species and that of the slave-maker Polyergus rufescens towards <b>corpses</b> <b>of</b> different rival and non-rival ant species. Besides examining the reactions towards <b>corpses</b> <b>of</b> different origin, we also analyzed the differences in the reaction towards nestmate corpses in various situations. We tested (2) the use <b>of</b> these <b>corpses</b> as sources <b>of</b> potential food and (3) infestations. Furthermore, we analyzed (4) the division of labor during waste management at different levels. Materials and methods In order to answer our questions, we performed investigations under field and laboratory conditions. Before the start of our work, we placed 10 freeze-killed <b>corpses</b> in front <b>of</b> the main entrances and inside the search arenas, respectively, and we observed the behavioral reactions of resident workers towards the <b>corpses</b> <b>of</b> different rival species, the number of nestmate workers around them, and the transport rate and direction <b>of</b> the different <b>corpses.</b> We used several kinds <b>of</b> <b>corpses,</b> namely <b>corpses</b> <b>of</b> nestmates (F. cinerea, F. sanguinea, P. rufescens and F. polyctena) as control, non-nestmates, submissive F. fusca and in some cases F. rufibarbis, slave-makers and their slaves, and territorial wood-ants (F. polyctena, F. pratensis and F. truncorum). In addition, we compared the reactions of the two slave-maker species (facultative F. sanguinea and obligate Polyergus rufescens) towards each other, their slaves, and <b>corpses</b> <b>of</b> potential slave species under laboratory conditions. The role <b>of</b> <b>corpses</b> as food sources was tested in the case <b>of</b> the nestmate <b>corpses</b> <b>of</b> F. polyctena and the <b>corpses</b> <b>of</b> D. melanogaster. The reactions to these corpses were also tested after submerging them in pure oleic acid, as a response to artificial corpse smell. The amount <b>of</b> nestmate <b>corpses</b> used as food sources were further investigated with the help <b>of</b> painted <b>corpses</b> in the case of starved and satiated colonies, and older nestmates and rival C. vagus corpses. The experimental corpses were measured both before their intake into the nest and after their placement on the cemetery. For the analyses of the possible role <b>of</b> the <b>corpses</b> as infection focars, we tested the reactions towards <b>corpses</b> <b>of</b> nestmate F. polyctena treated with spores and hyphae of the entomopathogenic fungi B. bassiana. The division of labor in waste management activities at caste and individual level was analyzed in the polymorphic ant species C. aethiops, which has workers that can be divided in different size castes, namely minor, media and major. Results On the basis of our findings during the field experiments, F. cinerea responded in a clearly different way to the different <b>corpses</b> <b>of</b> its competitors. The <b>corpses</b> <b>of</b> the slave-maker F. sanguinea and those of the territorial wood ants elicited more aggressive reaction, and they were transported much more quickly than the <b>corpses</b> <b>of</b> the submissive species F. fusca, and those of the non-nestmate and nestmate F. cinerea. The majority <b>of</b> <b>corpses</b> were transported inside the nest. During our laboratory experiments with F. cinerea, we found similar reactions, at least towards the major rivals, but there were differences compared to the field observations, due to the different habitat origin of the study colonies. Similarly, we found intensive reactions towards the <b>corpses</b> <b>of</b> the slave maker F. sanguinea, its slave species, and the territorial F. pratensis. Comparing the reaction of the two slave maker species, we found that in F. sanguinea, the <b>corpses</b> <b>of</b> its rival P. rufescens and its slave species elicited the most intensive reaction, which was followed by the reaction towards the corpses belonging to non-nestmates and their slaves. The <b>corpses</b> <b>of</b> species that our study species do not meet under natural conditions, were transported slowly, and elicited a similar reaction to food consumption. P. rufescens reacted (with small differences) similarly towards the different types <b>of</b> <b>corpses,</b> except the <b>corpses</b> <b>of</b> the non-nestmate P. rufescens and its slave, which elicited an intensive reaction. Interestingly, in the territorial F. polyctena, the <b>corpses</b> <b>of</b> another territorial species (F. truncorum) did not elicit an intensive reaction, which was even less pronounced than the reaction towards the <b>corpses</b> <b>of</b> the submissive F. fusca. The most intensive reaction was elicited by the <b>corpses</b> <b>of</b> F. sanguinea, which was followed by the <b>corpses</b> <b>of</b> non-nestmates. Besides the differentiation between the <b>corpses</b> <b>of</b> nestmates and alien species, F. polyctena were able to differentiate corpses treated with concentrated oleic acid from the untreated ones. Corpses treated with oleic acid elicited a fast burial, and, after a while, they were transported inside the nest. The reaction towards the untreated <b>corpses</b> <b>of</b> D. melanogaster elicited a higher level of aggressivity and a faster transport compared to the reactions towards every other corpse type. The analysis <b>of</b> the nestmate <b>corpse</b> consumption rate showed an elevation in the case of satiated colonies, and this remained high even after the retake of normal feeding after the starvation-stress. We also found a rather elevated consumption rate in the case <b>of</b> old <b>corpses</b> and those <b>of</b> the rival C. vagus. In this latter case, the highest rate <b>of</b> <b>corpses</b> taking apart was observed. The reactions towards the infected <b>corpses</b> <b>of</b> different stages showed an exponential response, and these corpses were clearly differentiated by the workers. Those with spores elicited an intensive grooming, while those with hyphae were surrounded by many aggressive individuals, which cleaned them heavily, and after a while both types were transported inside the nests. The analysis of the division of labor showed that a smaller waste management activity was observed in the case of major workers compared to the other two castes (minor, media). In the case of the minor and media workers, we observed individual differences in the waste management and other activities, as well. 15...|$|R
