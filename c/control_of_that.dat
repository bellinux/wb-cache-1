5|$|After the {{initiation}} of Operation Rolling Thunder, the sustained aerial campaign against North Vietnam that had begun on 5 March 1965, the Barrel Roll area of operations was divided on 3 April. Barrel Roll was {{to continue in the}} northeast while the southern portion of the area, where interdiction missions against the Ho Chi Minh trail were paramount, was redesignated Tiger Hound. Command and <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> area was handed over to the American commander in Saigon, General William C. Westmoreland.|$|E
5|$|In August 684, the Umayyads {{and their}} tribal allies routed the pro-Zubayrid Qaysi tribes at the Battle of Marj Rahit. The Umayyad victory brought all of Syria under Marwan's authority, but {{also led to}} the long-running feud between Qays and Yaman. Later, Marwan {{dispatched}} an army led by Ubayd Allah to wrest back Iraq. <b>Control</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> region was split {{by a number of}} anti-Umayyad factions, including partisans of al-Mukhtar al-Thaqafi, other pro-Alids and Ibn al-Zubayr. Marwan promised Ubayd Allah the governorship of all the territories he conquered. In early January 685, Ubayd Allah was mobilizing his troops at the Euphrates town of Jisr Manbij. Around that time, his second-in-command, Husayn ibn Numayr al-Sakuni, destroyed the Penitents, a pro-Alid band led by Sulayman ibn Surad, at the Battle of 'Ayn al-Warda in modern-day Ras al-Ayn. Marwan died in the spring of 685, while Ubayd Allah's army was camped at Raqqa, and Marwan's son Abd al-Malik succeeded him as caliph.|$|E
5|$|On the Danubian plains {{north of}} Vienna, the summer battles of Aspern-Essling and Wagram shaped {{the outcome of}} the 1809 campaign. Klenau's forces played a {{critical}} role at both. At Aspern-Essling, Napoleon's army was decisively defeated {{for the first time in}} northern Europe, demonstrating that the master of Europe could himself be mastered. After their defeat at Wagram, the Austrians withdrew into Moravia, leaving the French in <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> part of the Danube valley; Wagram was the largest European land-battle to date, engaging 262 battalions and 202 squadrons—153,000 men—for France and her allies, and 160 battalions and 150 squadrons—135,000 men—on the Austrian side.|$|E

5|$|In 1825, Talbot {{joined a}} weaving firm {{established}} by {{his older brother}} Charles in Williamsburg, Massachusetts, where he was first employed as a carder and finisher, and quickly rose to become superintendent. His brother moved to Lowell in 1838, selling the Williamsburg mill, and began processing dyewoods in rented space at a local mill, while Thomas remained in western Massachusetts, working in area mills and continuing his education at an academy in Cummington. In 1840, the two brothers established C.P. Talbot & Co., a business partnership that lasted until Charles died in 1884. The business started out processing dyewoods {{for use in the}} textile industry, but expanded into other industrial chemical processing in 1849. The brothers acquired the Concord River water rights of the defunct Middlesex Canal Corporation in 1851, and in 1857 they established Talbot Mills in North Billerica, Massachusetts, in partnership with the Belvidere Mill Company. The business was successful, and the brothers acquired full <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> business in 1862. Thomas focused on the textile business while Charles continued to manage the dye and chemical interests, expanding the facilities in 1870 and again in 1880.|$|E

In 2010, Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature, giving them <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> body {{for the first time}} in 136 years.

25|$|On July 1, 1869 the Pennsylvania Railroad leased the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway {{in which}} it had {{previously}} been an investor. The lease gave the PRR complete <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> line's direct route through northern Ohio and Indiana as well as entry into the emerging rail hub city of Chicago, Illinois. Acquisitions along the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway: Erie and Pittsburgh Railroad, Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad, Toledo, Columbus and Ohio River Railroad, and Pittsburgh, Youngstown and Ashtabula Railway gave the PRR access to the iron ore traffic on Lake Erie.|$|E
25|$|Both President Makarios and Dr. Küçük issued {{calls for}} peace, {{but these were}} ignored. Meanwhile, {{within a week of}} the {{violence}} flaring up, the Turkish army contingent had moved out of its barracks and seized the most strategic position on the island across the Nicosia to Kyrenia road, the historic jugular vein of the island. They retained <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> road until 1974, at which time it acted as a crucial link in Turkey's military invasion. From 1963 up to the point of the Turkish invasion of 20 July 1974, Greek Cypriots who wanted to use the road could only do so if accompanied by a UN convoy.|$|E

25|$|In 1745, {{following}} {{the reign of}} the Bavarian Elector as Emperor Charles VII, Maria Theresa's husband Francis of Lorraine, Grand Duke of Tuscany, was elected Emperor, restoring <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> position to the Habsburgs (or, rather, to the new composite house of Habsburg-Lorraine), Francis holding the titular crown until his death in 1765, but his empress consort Maria Theresa carrying out the executive functions. The Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 applied to the hereditary possessions of the Habsburgs and Archduchy of Austria but not the position of Holy Roman Emperor, which could not be held by women, thus Maria Theresa was Empress Consort not Empress Regnant.|$|E
25|$|The city of Rafah was {{strategically}} {{important to}} Israel because <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> city would sever the Gaza Strip from the Sinai {{and provide a}} way to the main centres of the northern Sinai, al-Arish and al-Qantarah. Holding the forts outside of Rafah were a mixture of Egyptian and Palestinian forces in the 5th Infantry Brigade commanded by Brigadier General Jaafar al-Abd. In Rafah itself the 87th Palestinian Infantry Brigade was stationed. Assigned to capture Rafah were 1st Infantry Brigade led by Colonel Benjamin Givli and 27th Armored Brigade commanded by Colonel Haim Bar-Lev of the IDF. To the south of Rafah were a series of mine-filled sand dunes and to the north were a series of fortified hills.|$|E
25|$|In 1670, however, hetman Doroshenko tried {{once again}} to take over Ukraine, and in 1671 Khan of Crimea, Adil Giray, {{supportive}} of the Commonwealth, was replaced with a new one, Selim I Giray, by the Ottoman sultan. Selim entered into an alliance with the Doroshenko's Cossacks; but again like in 1666–67 the Cossack-Tatar forces were dealt defeats by Sobieski. Selim then renewed his oath of allegiance to the Ottoman Sultan and pleaded for assistance, to which the Sultan agreed. Thus an irregular border conflict escalated into a regular war in 1671, as the Ottoman Empire was now prepared to send its regular units onto the battlefield {{in a bid to}} try to gain <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> region for itself.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the major}} {{concerns}} for the British government of the era was colonial expansion. During the eighteenth century the British colonies in North America had become more populous and powerful - and were agitating to expand westwards into the American interior. The territory most prized by the new settlers was the Ohio Country, which was also claimed by France. As well as having economic potential, it was considered strategically key. French <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> territory would block British expansion westwards and eventually French territory would surround the British colonies, pinning them against the coast. A number of colonial delegations to London urged the government to take more decisive action in the Ohio dispute.|$|E
25|$|Like its predecessor, Battlefront II {{includes}} Galactic Conquest. In this mode, {{the player}} commands a fleet throughout the galaxy conquering and protecting planets, {{much like a}} game of Risk. When two opposing forces reach the same planet, the game switches to the traditional perspective, and the player must eliminate the enemy faction to gain <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> planet. Players gain credits for performing well {{which can be used}} to buy new character classes, a new fleet, or bonuses that provide additional support when attacking or defending a planet. While the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions allow cooperative and competitive battles in Galactic Conquest mode through splitscreen gameplay, the PC version does not.|$|E
25|$|Each Boer {{commando}} {{unit was}} sent to the district from which its members had been recruited, which meant that they could rely on local support and personal knowledge of the terrain and the towns within the district thereby enabling them to live off the land. Their orders were simply to act against the British whenever possible. Their tactics were to strike fast and hard causing as much damage to the enemy as possible, and then to withdraw and vanish before enemy reinforcements could arrive. The vast distances of the Republics allowed the Boer commandos considerable freedom to move about and made it nearly impossible for the 250,000 British troops to control the territory effectively using columns alone. As soon as a British column left a town or district, British <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> area faded away.|$|E

25|$|On 18 April 1885 the Li-Ito Agreement {{was made}} in Tianjin, China, between the Japanese and the Chinese. In it, they agreed to both pull troops out of Joseon and that either party would send troops only if their {{property}} was endangered and that each would inform the other before doing so. Both nations also agreed to pull out their military instructors to allow the newly arrived Americans to take full <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> duty. The Japanese withdrew troops from Korea, leaving {{a small number of}} legation guards, but the Queen Consort was ahead of the Japanese in their game. She summoned Chinese envoys and through persuasion, convinced them to keep 2,000 soldiers disguised as Joseon police or merchants to guard the borders from any suspicious Japanese actions and to continue to train Korean troops.|$|E
25|$|In the Fort Smith-Fayetteville, Arkansas market, {{low-power}} Fox affiliate KPBI-CA (channel 46) {{switched to}} MyNetworkTV (along with KPBI (TV), channel 54). Fox had moved its affiliation to full-power KFTA-TV (channel 24), formerly a satellite of NBC affiliate KNWA-TV (channel 51). None {{of the three}} stations that were available (the two KPBI's and UPN affiliate KFDF-CA (channel 10)) joined The CW; they were all owned by Equity Broadcasting, which shunned The CW {{in every one of}} its markets (KFDF-CA joined the Equity-owned Retro Television Network instead). The CW would finally come to the market the following year on a cable-only channel available via Cox Communications (and eventually on digital subchannels of the market's ABC affiliate, KHBS/KHOG-TV, channels 40 and 29). Equity would eventually declare bankruptcy in 2009 due to a number of factors involving the digital transition and problems with RTV which led it to losing <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> network to Luken Communications.|$|E
25|$|The {{outcomes}} of an invasion may {{vary according to}} the objectives of both invaders and defenders, the success of the invasion and the defense, and {{the presence or absence of}} an agreed settlement between the warring parties. The most common outcome is the loss of territory, generally accompanied by a change in government and often the loss of direct <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> government by the losing faction. This sometimes results in the transformation of that country into a client state, often accompanied by requirements to pay reparations or tribute to the victor. In other cases the results of a successful invasion may simply be a return to the status quo; this can be seen in wars of attrition, when the destruction of personnel and supplies is the main strategic objective, or where a nation previously subdued and currently occupied by an aggressive third party is restored to control of its own affairs (i.e. Western Europe following the Normandy landings in 1944, or Kuwait following the defeat of Iraq in 1991). In some cases, the invasion may be strategically limited to a geographical area, which is carved into a separate state as with the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971.|$|E
