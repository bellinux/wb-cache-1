40|$|Rolling {{noise is}} {{excited by the}} {{roughness}} of the wheel/rail running surfaces. The contact patch acts as a filter attenuating the excitation at wavelengths that are short in comparison with its length. Additionally, the excitation depends on the variations in roughness profile height across {{the width of the}} contact. While most available wheel/rail interaction models include the <b>contact</b> <b>filter</b> effect by roughness pre-processing, a time-domain model is presented in this paper that includes the <b>contact</b> <b>filter</b> effect dynamically by an appropriate two-dimensional (2 D) or three-dimensional (3 D) non-Hertzian contact model. The 2 D contact model is based on a Winkler bedding, while wheel and rail are locally approximated by elastic half-spaces in the 3 D contact model. The wheel/rail interaction model is applied to evaluate the <b>contact</b> <b>filter</b> effect for different sets of roughness data measured in several parallel lines. It is found that the 3 D contact model gives, as a general tendency, a contact force level several dB lower than the 2 D model.

The narrow range doses (0 - 1 mg/ml) were further tested to determine the EC 50 and LD 50. The EC 50 dose of sodium arsenite was considered at which 50 % of earthworms exhibited rejection to the spot on filter paper in the spot rejection test. The LD 50 of sodium arsenite resulting in mortality in 50 % of Eisenia fetida was studied with <b>contact</b> <b>filter</b> paper bioassay (24 hrs) and soil bioassay (14 days). In the range finding test, there was no mortality in control and 0. 1 mg/ml but 100 % mortality was observed at doses of 1 mg and above after 24 hours. Thus, for further study smaller doses intervals in the range between 0 - 1 mg/ml was selected for spot rejection, <b>contact</b> <b>filter</b> paper and soil bioassay. The percent mortality in each test was computed and was subjected to regression analysis to get a linear dose response curve and estimation of EC 50 and LD 50. The EC 50 was estimated as 0. 3 mg/ml of sodium arsenite concentration to Eisenia fetida. The 24 hrs- LD 50 was estimated as 0. 4 mg/cm 2 in filter paper and 14 days-LD 50 as 5 mg/kg in soil bioassay.

Optimization of both the removal of particulate matter and collection of bio-oil will require this information. In addition, the success of catalytic reforming of bio-oil to high-value chemicals will depend upon this transport phase.;A variety of experimental techniques were used to identify the transport phase.

It is found that the analytical model gives an attenuation that is too large at short wavelengths but is usable for wavelengths down to somewhat smaller than {{the length of the}} contact patch. Additionally, variations in the detailed geometry of the profile can cause the contact point on the wheel and rail to oscillate laterally. This introduces an oscillating moment that can induce additional vibration and noise.

It is found that, while the direct roughness excitation is still more important, the moment excitation can be significant, particularly for conforming profiles...|$|E
40|$|Most {{geotechnical}} projects involving compacted {{soils are}} typically {{in a state}} of unsaturated condition. However, compressibility characteristics of such soils are typically estimated extending the principles that are commonly used for saturated soils.

40|$|For the {{observance}} {{of the new}} drinking water arsenic standard of 10 #mu#g/l treatment processes were developed and optimized to provide a safe and effective arsenic removal method for water works. An effective removal of As(V) is possible by precipitation with ferric or ferrous salts, followed by filtration. The difference between Fe(II) and Fe(III) is {{the structure of the}} formed solid ferric hydroxides and their filtration properties. Adsorption technique is a simpler method and therefore especially interesting for small water works. An adequate adsorption on activated alumina in fixed bed reactors can only be reached with low pH values. The newly developed granulated ferric hydroxide has a much higher adsorption capacity. The suitability for drinking water treatment has been verified in experiments. In principle Hyper- and Nanofiltration are applicable, too. The disadvantage of this technique is the removal of other water components. Therefore arsenic removal from concentrate by adsorption technique is proposed. By all treatment technologies a sufficient separation of As(III) is not possible, so it had to be oxidized first. Effective As(III) -oxidation was achieved in a <b>contact</b> <b>filter</b> with solid manganese oxide.

40|$|Recent {{research}} {{has suggested that}} the contact mechanics between the wheel and rail in railway systems may act as a geometric filter for promoting the growth of short pitch wear-type corrugations. It has been proposed that this effect may explain some field observations indicating a speed insensitivity of the dominant wavelength of short pitch corrugation. In this paper, further insight into contact induced wear filtering is obtained and the relative importance of contact filtering and structural dynamics mechanisms on corrugation growth is quantified. In particular, an analytical model of the wear due to the rolling contact of a wheel over a general rail profile is first presented. This model is able to be implemented in an efficient manner and facilitates an investigation into the non-linear behaviour of the dynamic wear not discussed in previous research. In addition, the relative importance of this mechanism when compared to that of dynamic normal force variations on corrugation growth, is determined and quantified. Comparative results indicate that the contact filtering effect only significantly amplifies short pitch corrugation growth when corrugation amplitudes are small (order of 1 mu m). Over multiple vehicle passes, this contact amplifying effect is shown to decrease to a negligible level and the peak amplitude shifts to longer wavelengths. These <b>contact</b> <b>filter</b> effects are self-limiting on corrugation growth for wavelengths above the contact patch width. When quantitatively compared against corrugation growth due to structural dynamics, the contact filtering effect is shown to make a much smaller contribution to corrugation growth rates for this model of corrugation development, but it provides a lower bound on corrugation wavelength in accordance with Remington.

40|$|The {{structure}} of a protein ultimately determines its function; therefore, knowledge of three-dimensional structure is essential for understanding its function and mechanism of action. The two most common methods for determining protein structure are x-ray crystallography and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. These methods are quite successful but can be very time-intensive and costly. An alternative method is protein structure prediction, where structure is computationally predicted from amino acid sequence. As opposed to x-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, protein structure prediction is not encumbered by potential experimental problems. In this research, we attempted to determine if certain protein structure features, known as tertiary contacts, can improve the prediction of protein three-dimensional structure. By calculating and analyzing sequence homology and related values, it was shown that tertiary contacts, which typically are long-range amino acid interactions separated by at least 10 amino acids in sequence length, generally have lower pair averaged sequence homology-based values. From our calculations {{we were able to}} create a prediction filter based on our known literature-derived tertiary contacts of whether amino acid residues are buried or on the surface of a protein.

30|$|Rail {{corrugation}} is an undulatory wear which occasionally {{occurs on}} the rail rolling surface. The research history of rail corrugation {{can be traced back}} to 1900 s. Since then, many researchers have made gigantic contributions to the understanding of the generation mechanism of rail corrugation. It is well known that the generation mechanism of rail corrugation consists of both the material damage and wavelength fixing mechanisms [1]. Several sagacious concepts have been proposed in the literature, which include the wear law of the frictional power causing rail working surface wear [2], the feedback mechanism for corrugation development [3], the <b>contact</b> <b>filter</b> [4], the pinned–pinned resonance [5], and so on. Specifically, Hempelmann et al. [2] studied rail corrugation, holding an opinion that rail working surface wear is dominated by the wear law of the frictional power. Hempelmann and Knothe [3] extended a linear model to study the short pitch corrugation. Müller [6] studied rail corrugation from the instability of the wheel–rail system. Igeland and Ilias [7] studied rail corrugation from the viewpoint of non-linear interaction between wheel and rail. Knothe and Ripke [8] studied parameter sensitivity of rail corrugation. Andersson and Johansson [9] studied rail corrugation using a three-dimensional wheel–rail interaction model. Johansson and Nielsen [10] studied the influence of powered wheelsets with wheel tread irregularities on rail corrugation. Clark [11] and Brockley [12] studied rail corrugation from the viewpoint of stick–slip vibration of the wheel–rail system. Wu and Thompson [13] attributed rail corrugation to the micro-slip between wheel and rail. Xie and Iwnicki [14] analyzed the railhead wear using a three-dimensional non-Hertzian and non-steady contact model. Daniel and Coworkers [15] discussed the effect of the wheel pass time delay on rail corrugation. Matsumoto [16] and Suda [17] all believed that rail corrugation was probably due to the stick–slip vibration of the wheel–rail system. Sun and Simson [18] studied rail corrugation using an integrated model including rail surface roughness and stick–slip vibration of the wheel–rail system. Jin [19] developed a comprehensive three-dimensional train-track model to study rail corrugation. Contributions from these researchers constitute the theoretical groundwork of rail corrugation.|$|E
40|$|Rail {{corrugation}} is {{a periodic}} wear pattern that develops {{on the wheel}} and rail contacting surfaces in railway systems. It is a commonly observed phenomenon worldwide and {{is a serious problem}} because it causes degradation of the track and its components and is a significant source of noise. Currently the only reliable method of ameliorating the negative effects of rail corrugation is to periodically regrind the rail surface to a smooth profile, at great expense to the railway operator. It is therefore of interest to investigate other possible control strategies to reduce corrugation growth through an understanding of the mechanism of corrugation formation. This thesis presents an investigation into the effect of speed variation on the corrugation formation mechanism. The research presented is intended to highlight the significant role that speed variation has on corrugation formation via a disruption of the feedback mechanism which leads to corrugation growth over successive train passages. This discovery motivates the investigation the feasibility of altered speed variation as a novel corrugation control method, due to the large effect that the variance of train speed has on corrugation growth rates. The effect of variable pass speed on corrugation formation has been investigated in this thesis through the use of efficient models of corrugation formation in straight track and cornering conditions. These models are simple enough to readily perform corrugation control studies without neglecting any relevant physics, obscuring the corrugation formation mechanism with overly detailed modelling or imposing a significant computational burden on performing control studies. These novel models have been outlined and their predictions elucidated in detail. A theoretical investigation into the effect of speed variation {{in the presence of a}} resonance free mechanism for corrugation growth via a <b>contact</b> <b>filter</b> has been performed and shown to only be important when the dynamic wavelength of formation approaches the size of the contact patch. The results of these corrugation models have been validated via test rig and field experiments.

The results of this thesis have formed the basis of an industry supported field trail of this technique for corrugation mitigation that is currently in progress...|$|E
40|$|A {{laboratory}} test program {{was conducted to}} determine the moisture-suction relationships of geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs). Moisture-suction relationships were determined by combining suction data from pressure plate tests, <b>contact</b> <b>filter</b> paper tests, and relative humidity tests, then fitting water retention curves (WRCs) to the data. WRCs were determined for wetting processes and drying processes in terms of gravimetric moisture content and volumetric moisture content. The effects of GCL type, hydration solution, wet-dry cycles, and temperature on the moisture-suction relationships were analyzed. The three GCLs of the test program consisted of configurations of woven and nonwoven geotextiles reinforced with needlepunched fibers. A geofilm was adhesively bonded to the nonwoven side {{of one of the}} GCL products. The hydration solution tests involved hydrating GCLs with deionized water, tap water, 0. 1 M CaCl 2, or soil water from a landfill cover test plot for a 30 -day conditioning period prior to testing. Cyclic wet-dry tests were conducted on the GCL specimens subjected to 20 wet-dry cycles from 50 % to 0 % gravimetric moisture content prior to testing. Temperature tests were conducted at 2 °C, 20 °C, and 40 °C. GCL type affected moisture-suction relationships. The GCLs with an adhesively-bonded geofilm exhibited lower air-entry suction and higher residual suction than GCLs without a geofilm. The degree of needlepunched fiber pullout during hydration contributed to hysteresis between wetting WRCs and drying WRCs. Hysteresis was high for suction values below air-entry suction and was low for suction values greater than air-entry suction. Cation exchange reduced the water retention capacity for all three GCL types. The saturated gravimetric moisture contents were reduced from approximately 140 % to 70 % for wetting WRCs and 210 % to 90 % for drying WRCs for GCLs hydrated in deionized water compared to CaCl 2 solution. Hysteresis of the nonwoven product decreased from 71 %, to 62 %, to 28 % with respect to deionized water, tap water, and CaCl 2 solution. Hysteresis of the woven product exposed to soil water was 24 % and 0 %, in terms of saturated gravimetric moisture content and saturated volumetric moisture content, respectively. The swell index, Atterberg Limits, mole fraction of bound sodium, and scanning electron microscopy images that were determined of bentonite from the conditioned GCLs indicated that changes in water retention capacity corresponded with cation exchange. Wet-dry cycles and temperature affected the moisture-suction behavior for GCLs. Wet-dry cycles reduced hysteresis and increased the swelling capacity of GCL specimens. Microscopy images indicated that wet-dry cycles caused weak orientation of the clay particles. Increasing temperature resulted in a small decrease in water retention capacity. Results of the test program provided a means for predicting unsaturated behavior for GCLs...|$|E
40|$|Matrix-mediated epitheliomesenchymal {{interactions}} control dental cytodifferentiations. Ex-periments {{were performed}} {{in order to}} {{study the effects of}} noncollagenous proteins extracted from dentin on cultured enamel organs and dental papillae. Seven noncollagenous protein fractions were prepared from rabbit incisor dentin and used as substrates to coat Millipore filters. Embryonic mouse tooth germs were dissociated and the isolated tissues were cultured for 4 days on these different substrates as well as on noncoated Millipore filters. When compared to control cultures, only two protein fractions affected the behaviour of epithelial cells. A slight elongation of the cell body and a preferential localization of the nuclei at the basal pole of the cells in <b>contact</b> with the <b>filter</b> was observed with protein fractions 5 and 6. When dental papillae were cultured on Millipore filters coated either with protein fraction 2 or fraction 6, the mesenchymal cells in <b>contact</b> with the <b>filter</b> elongated, polarized and demon-strated a high metabolic activity. Such modifications in the cell organization, implying changes in the cytoskeleton organization and, or, activity, never occurred spontaneously or in the presence of isolated collagens (I-V), laminin or fibronectin...|$|R
40|$|The high {{frequency}} dynamic {{interaction of the}} wheels rolling on the track is {{a major contributor to}} the noise generated by railways. By making use of measurements on a reduced scale laboratory facility, it is possible to study the interaction in a more controllable and accessible way than is possible on an operational railway. A one-fifth scale facility is described along with measurement results. Particular problems of measuring at reduced scale are addressed. Particular attention is given to the influence of the <b>contact</b> patch <b>filtering</b> effects on the wheel and rail surface roughness, the wheel and track dynamics, and the decay of vibration {{along the length of the}} rail. Comparisons with the results from a simple prediction model show good agreement...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. Using a new mapping {{system that}} allows the {{simultaneous}} acquisition of date from 25 right atrial bipolar electrodes during cardiac catheterization, we mapped normal sinus rhythm and atrial reentrant tachycardia in 24 sheep (20 to 49 kg) and 7 pigs (25 to 35 kg). Background. Rapid, high resolution mapping during cardiac catheterization may shorten ablation procedures and permit ablation of otherwise refractory arrhythmias. Methods. A flexible, elliptic, basket-shaped recording catheter has five spokes, each with 10 electrodes arranged as 5 bipolar pairs. Catheter shape, electrode spacing and introduction technique were modified {{in response to the}} results of experiments in the first 23 animals. In the most recent eight animals, retraction of a string attached to the distal tip distended the basket, providing safe tissue <b>contact.</b> <b>Filtered</b> (30 to 250 Hz) bipolar recordings from all 25 electrode pairs, as well as a surface electrocardiogram, were recorded and digitized at 1, 000 Hz using custom software. An activation map was digitally constructed and superimposed on anteroposterior and lateral fluoroscopic catheter images. Bipolar recordings were made in normal sinus rhythm (31 animals), with adequate signals recorded from > 95 % of electrode pairs. Rapid burst pacing and intentional right atrial air embolus (30 to 50 ml) induced sustained atrial reentrant tachycardia in five animais, which was also adequately recorded. Results. Catheter positioning and complete atrial mapping required < 10 min after venous access in the most recent eight experiments. The catheter was left in position for up to 4 h. Postmortem evaluation revealed minor superficial abrasion of the venae cavae or right atrial endocardium in six animals and moderate abrasion in two. No other damage was observed. Conclusions. This new system may ultimately assist in mapping simple or complex atrial arrhythmias during cardiac eatheterization...|$|R
