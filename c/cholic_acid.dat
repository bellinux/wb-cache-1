Here, we in vitro assessed the potential probiotic aptitude of a de-replicated set of NSLAB previously isolated from long ripened Parmigiano Reggiano cheeses (22 Lactobacillus rhamnosus, 18 Lactobacillus paracasei, 3 Lactobacillus casei, 2 Lactobacillus harbinensis, and 2 Lactobacillus fermentum). Most strains showed moderate to good resistance to biological barriers, including bile salts, lysozyme, and simulated gastric and pancreatic juices. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests against seven antimicrobials belonging to different categories showed that most strains are susceptible towards all the antibiotics, {{with the exception of}} vancomycin and streptomycin. The strains lost the streptomycin resistance when assayed on agar medium containing 0. 5 % bile salts, suggesting that detergent-like properties of <b>cholic</b> <b>acids</b> increase membrane permeability and mediate streptomycin susceptibility. No isolate showed bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activities, supporting that bile salts resistance and BSH activity are unpaired traits. Finally, NSLAB strains had moderate to high auto-aggregative and hydrophobic phenotypes, whereas two subsets of 22 and 8 strains co-aggregated with Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica s. typhimurium, respectively.

This study aimed to describe the metabolite changes in the liver of hairless mice following chronic exposure to UVB radiation. We did not observe significant macroscopic changes or alterations in hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the liver of UVB-irradiated mice, compared with those for normal mice. In this study, we detected hepatic metabolite changes by UVB exposure and identified several amino acids, fatty acids, nucleosides, carbohydrates, phospholipids, lysophospholipids, and taurine-conjugated <b>cholic</b> <b>acids</b> as candidate biomarkers in response to UVB radiation in the mouse liver by using various mass spectrometry (MS) -based metabolite profiling including ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight (TOF) -MS, gas chromatography-TOF-MS and nanomate LTQ-MS.

The results from altering several types of metabolites suggest that chronic UVB irradiation may impact significantly on major hepatic metabolism processes, despite the fact that the liver is not directly exposed to UVB radiation.

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{detection}} of methicillin resistant staphylococci, lowered incubation temperature (30 °C) and inclusion of sodium chloride in media have been empirically recommended. However, in this study, we found that sodium chloride in Peptone-Yeast Extract-K 2 HPO 4 (PYK) medium decreased methicillin minimum inhibitory concentrations. Divalent cations were shown to restore the expression of staphylococcal methicillin resistance. However, when it was determined by efficiency of plating, sodium chloride increased methicillin resistance expression on agar medium in which higher divalent cations were contained in the agar medium. The decrease of minimum inhibitory concentrations at 30 °C by sodium chloride occurred in Brain Heart Infusion but did not occur in other media investigated. Interestingly, both PYK and Brain Heart Infusion media had peptone, which contain <b>cholic</b> <b>acids</b> having detergent activities.

A detailed study of the mechanism of binding and selectivity of bile acids binding proteins towards the physiological pool of bile salts is a key issue for the complete {{understanding of the role}} of these proteins and their involvement in cholesterol homeostasis. In the present study, we modeled the ternary complex of cLBABP with two molecules of bile salts using the data driven docking program HADDOCK on the basis of NMR and mass spectrometry data. Docking resulted in good 3 D models, satisfying the majority of experimental restraints. The docking procedure represents a necessary step to help in the structure determination and in functional analysis of such systems, in view of the high complexity of the 3 D structure determination of a ternary complex with two identical ligands. HADDOCK models show that residues involved in binding are mainly located in the C-terminal end of the protein, with two loops, CD and EF, playing a major role in ligand binding. A spine, comprising polar residues pointing toward the protein interior and involved in motion communication, has a prominent role in ligand interaction. The modeling approach has been complemented with NMR interaction and competition studies of cL-BABP with chenodeoxycholic and <b>cholic</b> <b>acids.</b> A higher affinity for chenodeoxycholic acid was observed and a Kd upper limit estimate was obtained.
