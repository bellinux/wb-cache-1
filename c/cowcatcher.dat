5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1886, Macdonald {{traveled}} for the only time to western Canada, traveling {{from town to town}} by private railway car, and addressing large crowds. Macdonald traveled with his wife, and to get a better view, the two would sometimes sit in front of the locomotive on the train's <b>cowcatcher.</b> On 13 August 1886, Macdonald used a silver hammer and pounded a gold spike to complete the Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway.|$|E
5|$|Through WED Enterprises, {{a legally}} {{separate}} entity from Walt Disney Productions, Walt Disney retained personal {{ownership of the}} DRR and financed the creation of two trains to run on it in time for Disneyland's opening day. The names of both trains contained the word Retlaw, which is Walter spelled backwards. The first train, referred to by Disneyland employees as Retlaw 1, would be pulled by the No. 2 locomotive, which was given a turn-of-the-20th century appearance with a straight smokestack (typical of coal-burning locomotives), a circular headlamp, and a small <b>cowcatcher.</b> The No. 2 locomotive would pull six 1890s-style passenger cars designed by Bob Gurr, consisting of a combine car, four coaches, and an observation coach. The second train, referred to by Disneyland employees as Retlaw 2, would be pulled by the No. 1 locomotive, which was given a late-19th century appearance with a spark-arresting diamond smokestack (typical of wood-burning locomotives), a rectangular headlamp, and a large <b>cowcatcher.</b> The No. 1 locomotive would pull six freight cars consisting of three cattle cars, two gondolas, and a caboose. Walt Disney Studios built the train cars {{and most of the}} parts for the locomotives; Dixon Boiler Works built the locomotive boilers, and Wilmington Iron Works built the locomotive frames. Both locomotives were designed to run on diesel oil to generate steam. Final assembly of the locomotives and their tenders took place at the Disneyland site in the DRR's new roundhouse, which was built in one week by a construction crew directed by Park Construction Administrator Joe Fowler, a former US Navy rear admiral. The two original DRR trains cost over $240,000 to build, with the two locomotives costing over $40,000 each.|$|E
5|$|The company's {{financial}} difficulties after 1866 had precluded the purchasing of any more locomotives until six 4-4-0 locomotives {{were built in}} 1876 by Neilson's, partly to replace the Deeside locomotives. These had larger boilers and fireboxes than previous locomotives and {{were the first to}} be built with cabs. The next twelve locomotives had rounded splashers over the trailing driving wheels, meaning the shape of the cab was different, but retained the brass dome on the firebox, copper capped chimney and had brass bands joining the firebox and boiler. After James Manson became locomotive superintendent in 1883 he introduced a more contemporary design of locomotive, with inside cylinders and doors on the side of cabs and without brass domes or copper chimneys. The first six were built by Kitson & Co in Leeds in 1884, followed by three similar but lighter in 1885. The railway had inherited most of its tank engines from the Deeside, Morayshire and Banffshire Railways and these needed replacing, so six arrived in 1884 and three slightly larger the following year. The first tank engines in the country to be fitted with doors on the cabs, these worked on the suburban services and one was fitted with a <b>cowcatcher</b> to work the St Combs Light Railway at Fraserburgh. In 1887 two locomotives were built at Kittybrewster works. Although there was only space for four locomotives in the cramped repair shops the board expected to save £300 to £400 by building the locomotives themselves. Nine express locomotives with six-wheeled tenders were built by Kitsons in 1888 and these were followed by six more with eight-wheeled tenders built by Stephenson & Co, one of which was successfully trialled in 1914 with a superheater. Most of Manson's later locomotives were subsequently fitted with superheaters, the eight-wheeled tenders being replaced in most cases with six-wheeled tenders during the rebuild.|$|E

50|$|With {{both the}} bottle green {{and later the}} Gulf Red SAR liveries, the units had red <b>cowcatchers,</b> except in the Cape Western region. Locomotives based at the Bellville Depot could be {{identified}} by their yellow <b>cowcatchers.</b>|$|R
50|$|All the Class 6E1, Series 10 {{locomotives}} {{were delivered}} in the SAR red oxide livery with signal red <b>cowcatchers,</b> yellow whiskers and with the number plates on the sides mounted on three-stripe yellow wings. In the 1990s some of the Series 10 units were repainted in the Spoornet orange livery with a yellow and blue chevron pattern on the <b>cowcatchers.</b>|$|R
25|$|A {{minor change}} to the {{appearance}} of the streamlining was the removal of the locomotives' solid <b>cowcatcher</b> and its replacement with a lattice type, after it was discovered that the original design created a partial vacuum behind the <b>cowcatcher,</b> sucking dust and grime into the slide bars for the centre cylinder, leading to maintenance problems.|$|E
25|$|The side {{valances}} of the locomotives in streamlined form were {{prone to}} {{damage in the}} event of collision with trackside objects. During 1950, the valances were shortened to end at the buffer beam rather than extending {{to the base of the}} <b>cowcatcher.</b>|$|E
25|$|In August 1910 a motor cyclist {{driving down}} the Pill decided to cut through a gateway onto the railway line, he did so, {{narrowly}} avoiding a pair of lady pedestrians, only to be confronted by the 4.35pm from Bideford to Appledore. The driver managed to stop the train in less than its own length and the motorcyclist hit the <b>cowcatcher,</b> suffering only minor injuries.|$|E
50|$|The {{whole series}} was {{delivered}} in the SAR Gulf Red livery with signal red <b>cowcatchers,</b> yellow whiskers and with the number plates on the sides enclosed in three-stripe yellow wings. In the 1990s many of the Series 1 units began to be repainted in the Spoornet orange livery with a yellow and blue chevron pattern on the <b>cowcatchers.</b> By 2000 they were all repainted in this new livery.|$|R

25|$|The {{two halves}} of RM 121 are now being {{restored}} at Pahiatua; the {{two halves of}} the No 2 end have been welded together again and a new cab structure and <b>cowcatcher</b> built. The No 1 end has been stripped of any fittings from its time spent at Waitomo and various reconstruction work is taking place. The resultant car will utilise the bogies from AC 8140.|$|E
25|$|On 15 August 1952, S301 was {{involved}} in a fatal level crossing accident when it collided at high speed with a circus truck and trailer at Euroa, killing three people travelling in the truck. The accident caused significant damage to the streamlined cowling of the front of the locomotive. S301 was temporarily repaired with a semi-streamlined appearance, featuring a standard VR pressed steel slotted <b>cowcatcher</b> and an unstreamlined smokebox.|$|E
500|$|Pegler had a {{contract}} permitting {{him to run}} his locomotive on BR until 1972. Following overhaul {{in the winter of}} 1968–69 Harold Wilson's government agreed to support Pegler running the locomotive in the United States and Canada to support British exports. To comply with local railway regulations it was fitted with: a <b>cowcatcher,</b> bell, buckeye couplings, American-style whistle, air brakes, and high-intensity headlamp. Starting in Boston, Massachusetts, the tour ran into immediate problems, with some states increasing costs by requiring diesel-headed-haulage through them, seeing the locomotive as a fire hazard. However, the train ran from Boston to New York City, Washington, D.C. and Dallas in 1969; from Texas to Wisconsin and finishing in Montreal in 1970; and from Toronto to San Francisco in 1971 — a total of [...]|$|E

500|$|Due to poorer quality track {{than was}} the norm in its native England, the {{locomotive}} had much trouble with derailment; the C's engineers added a leading truck (an assembly consisting of an unpowered axle with smaller diameter wheels that {{was connected to the}} frame and pushed in front of the locomotive) to help guide the engine into curves. [...] The leading truck's mechanism necessitated the removal of the coupling rod between the two main axles, leaving only the rear axle powered. Effectively, the John Bull became a 4-2-0 (a locomotive with two unpowered axles, one powered main axle, and no trailing axles). Later, the C also added a pilot ("cowcatcher") to the lead truck. [...] The <b>cowcatcher</b> is an angled assembly designed to deflect animals and debris off of the railroad track in front of the locomotive. To protect the locomotive's crew from the weather, the C also added walls and a roof (a cab) {{to the rear of the}} locomotive where the controls were located. C workshop crews also added safety features such as a bell and headlight.|$|E
2500|$|When the U.S. entered World War I, the Federal {{government}} {{instituted a}} [...] "Wake Up America!" [...] campaign, and the United Cigar {{store in the}} Flatiron's <b>cowcatcher</b> donated its space to the U.S. Navy {{for use as a}} recruiting center. Liberty Bonds were sold outside on sidewalk stands. By the mid-1940s, the cigar store had been replaced with a Walgreens drug store. During the 1940s, the building was dominated by clothing and toy companies.|$|E
2500|$|Differences {{from the}} earlier Pioneer IIIs {{included}} a single arm Faiveley pantograph, {{a state of the}} art propulsion system that made use of solid state phase angle controllers coupled to mercury arc ignitron rectifiers and higher powered motors. [...] Like the Pioneer IIIs before them, the Silverliners offered their riders air cushion suspension, air conditioning, electric train heat and a nearly silent ride. [...] With 150hp more than the Pioneer III cars (550hp total) the Silverliners could achieve a 1.7mph/s acceleration rate which was quite higher than the older MP54s and multi-function couplers and disc brakes further improved performance. [...] The 38 PRR cars were numbered in two series, 201-219 and 251-269 and given PRR classification MP85B, while the 17 Reading cars were numbered 9001-9017 and given Reading classification REB-13. [...] There were also minor differences between the two sets of vehicles with the PRR units being fitted with only one overhead luggage rack, a bar pilot, a metal framed engineer's window and cab signals, with the Reading cars being fitted with a <b>cowcatcher</b> and twin overhead luggage racks. [...] The first set of PRR cars, #201-216, were also equipped with bathrooms in place of a 3-person bench seat in the 'F' end of the car to enable the cars use on longer runs to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, or New York City.|$|E
50|$|All the Class 7E1 {{locomotives}} {{were delivered}} in the SAR Gulf Red livery with signal red <b>cowcatchers,</b> yellow whiskers and with the number plates on the sides mounted on three-stripe yellow wings.

2500|$|The Silverliner IVs {{have never}} been officially rebuilt, {{but there have been}} a number of {{modifications}} to the class. [...] The propulsion system was initially upgraded from the original mercury arc–based Ignitron rectifiers to more reliable solid state silicon controlled rectifiers and later the main transformers had their coolant replaced with one that did not contain PCBs. [...] As this change was carried out in the early 1990s, all of the 9000 series Reading cars and some of the Penn Central cars were renumbered into the series 400 through 460 to help keep track of which units had undergone the modification. [...] When the Center City Commuter Connection opened in 1984, the Reading cars were converted to full train automatic door operation to take advantage of the high level platforms at the new Market East Station (now Jefferson Station) and others on the former PRR [...] "side" [...] of the system. [...] In the late 1990s the fleet received its most noticeable upgrade with the original [...] "ketchup and mustard" [...] colored interior replaced with a softer gray motif as well as softer seating. [...] Around 2004 SEPTA began to replace the <b>cowcatcher</b> pilots equipped on the original Reading cars with a bar type pilot to match those on the PRR cars. [...] Starting in 2009 SEPTA began to replace the original Faiveley pantographs with more modern Schunk type units.|$|E
2500|$|A little-known {{example of}} Jones' heroic {{instincts}} in action {{is described by}} his biographer and friend Fred J. Lee in his book, Casey Jones: Epic of the American Railroad (1939). He recounts an incident in 1895 as Jones' train approached Michigan City, Mississippi. He had left the cab in charge of fellow Engineer Bob Stevenson, who had reduced speed sufficiently for Jones to walk safely out on the running board to oil the relief valves. He advanced from the running board to the steam chest {{and then to the}} pilot beam to adjust the spark screen. He had finished well before they arrived at the station, as planned, and was returning to the cab when he noticed a group of small children dart in front of the train some [...] ahead. All cleared the rails easily except for a little girl who suddenly froze in fear {{at the sight of the}} oncoming locomotive. Jones shouted to Stevenson to reverse the train and yelled to the girl to get off the tracks in almost the same breath. Realizing that she was still immobile, he raced to the tip of the pilot or <b>cowcatcher</b> and braced himself on it, reaching out as far as he could to pull the frightened but unharmed girl from the rails. The event was partially spoofed in The Brave Engineer, in which the hero rescued a damsel from a cliché bandit.|$|E

60|$|As {{the crabs}} approached, the stern-jacket of the Adamant was let down, and the engines were slowed. This stern-jacket, when {{protecting}} the rudder and propellers, {{looked very much}} like the <b>cowcatcher</b> of a locomotive, and was capable of being put to a somewhat similar use. It was the intention of the captain of the Adamant, should the crabs attempt to attach themselves to his stern, to suddenly put on all steam, reverse his engines, and back upon them, the stern-jacket answering as a ram.|$|E
6000|$|The {{pilot of}} the head engine, because it [...] "punched the wind," [...] I knew would be too cold; so I {{selected}} the pilot of the second engine, which was sheltered by the first engine. I stepped on the <b>cowcatcher</b> and found the pilot occupied. In the darkness I felt out {{the form of a}} young boy. He was sound asleep. By squeezing, there was room for two on the pilot, and I made the boy budge over and crawled up beside him. It was a [...] "good" [...] night; the [...] "shacks" [...] (brakemen) didn't bother us, and in no time we were asleep. Once in a while hot cinders or heavy jolts aroused me, when I snuggled closer to the boy and dozed off to the coughing of the engines and the screeching of the wheels.|$|E
