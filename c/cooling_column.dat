2500|$|Limited {{graphite}} lifetime - Compact designs have {{a limited}} lifetime for the graphite moderator and fuel / breeding loop separator. Under the influence of fast neutrons, the graphite first shrinks, then expands indefinitely until it becomes very weak and can crack, creating mechanical problems and causing the graphite to absorb enough fission products to poison the reaction. The 1960 two-fluid design had an estimated graphite replacement period of four years. Eliminating graphite from sealed piping was a major incentive {{to switch to a}} single-fluid design. Replacing this large central part requires remotely operated equipment. MSR designs have to arrange for this replacement. In a molten salt reactor, virtually all of the fuel and fission products can be piped to a holding tank. Only a fraction of one percent of the fission products end up in the graphite, primarily due to fission products slamming into the graphite. This makes the graphite surface radioactive, and without recycling/removal of at least the surface layer, creates a fairly bulky waste stream. Removing the surface layer and recycling the remainder of the graphite would solve this issue. Several techniques exist to recycle or dispose of nuclear moderator graphite. Graphite is inert and immobile at low temperatures, so it can be readily stored or buried if required. At least one design used graphite balls (pebbles) floating in salt, which could be removed and inspected continuously without shutting down the reactor. Reducing power density increases graphite lifetime. [...] By comparison, solid-fueled reactors typically replace 1/3 of the fuel elements, including all of the highly radioactive fission products therein, every 12 to 24 months. This is routinely done under a protecting and <b>cooling</b> <b>column</b> layer of water.|$|E

Their initial separations were of the order of 50 - 100 m, 200 - 500 m, and 2 - 4 km, but all turned cyclonically and then anticyclonically to trace out a meander with amplitude of some 3 km and a wavelength of some 150 km.

In the absence of friction and downstream acceleration, the geostrophic departure is computed at- 27 cm/see at the cyclonic and 16 cm/set at the anticyclonic turn.

The drogue data were combined with Richardson dropsonde data collected by Nova University personnel a day before, for a synoptic view. The presence of the <b>cool</b> <b>column,</b> detected along the drogue path, may then be interpreted as a consequence of upstream horizontal divergence, detected by the dropsondes.

40|$|We {{present a}} unified {{analysis}} of the Ovi absorption-lines seen in the disk and halo of the Milky Way, high velocity clouds, the Magellanic Clouds, starburst galaxies, and the intergalactic medium. We show that these disparate systems define a simple relationship between the Ovi column density and absorption-line width that is independent of the Oxygen abundance over the range O/H ∼ 10 % to twice solar. We show that this relation is exactly that predicted theoretically as a radiatively cooling flow of hot gas passes through the coronal temperature regime- independent of its density or metallicity (for O/H � 0. 1 solar). Since most of the intergalactic Ovi clouds obey this relation, we infer {{that they can not}} have metallicities less than a few percent solar.

40|$|AbstractFire could {{dramatically}} reduce {{strength of}} reinforced concrete columns. The {{objective of this}} work is to study columns exposed to fire under axial load and to evaluate reduction in column compressive capacity after fire. The {{first part of this}} research is experimental investigation of fifteen-column specimens (15 × 15 × 100) cm exposed except one specimen to (600 °C) fire. The second part is a theoretical analysis performed using three-dimensional nonlinear finite element program. The main studied parameters were concrete strength, fire duration, level of applied loads, longitudinal reinforcement yield strength, percentage of longitudinal reinforcement, and bar diameters. Comparison between experimental results and theoretical analysis indicated that for columns not exposed to fire, the first crack appeared at 80 % of column failure load while the first crack occurred at 50 % of column failure load for columns exposed to fire. Columns with the same reinforcement percentage but with smaller bar diameters gained less lateral strain and smaller vertical displacement than columns with bigger bar diameters.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Measurements of in-soil {{diffusion}} coefficients and {{the application}} of an appropri-ate diffusional model can allow for a more accurate prediction of soil gas concentrations and movement to locate subterranean contamination of volatile materials. The present study was undertaken to measure and evaluate the “apparent in-soil diffusion coefficient ” for n-butane through soil columns under non-steady-state conditions. The term “apparent in-soil diffusion coefficient ” refers to a numerical coefficient that primarily describes the movement of the material by diffusion but also contains effects due to other mechanisms (e. g., adsorption and solubility). Six test columns were evaluated at three soil porosity levels ranging from 0. 30 to 0. 43 and at two column temperature conditions, nominally 18 °C and 7 °C. Soil columns measured 25. 4 cm in diameter by 84 cm in height and contained a moist sand/silt/clay mixture. The numerical range for the apparent in-soil diffusion coefficients for n-butane was 0. 447 × 10 – 3 cm 2 /s to 0. 561 × 10 – 3 cm 2 /s.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a simple method for deriving climatological {{values of the}} longwave flux emitted from the clear sky atmosphere to the ice-free ocean surface. It is shown using both theory and data from simulations how {{the ratio of the}} surface to top-of-atmosphere (TOA) flux is a simple function of water vapor (W) and a validation of the simple relationship is presented based on a limited set of surface flux measurements. The rms difference between the retrieved surface fluxes and the simulated surface fluxes is approximately 6 W/sq m. The clear sky <b>column</b> <b>cooling</b> rate of the atmosphere is derived from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) values of the clear sky TOA flux and the surface flux retrieved using Special Scanning Microwave Imager (SSM/I) measurements of w together with ERBE clear sky fluxes. The relationship between this <b>column</b> <b>cooling</b> rate, w, and the sea surface temperature (SST) is explored and it is shown how the cooling rate systematically increases as both w and SST increase. The uncertainty implied in these estmates of cooling are approximately +/- 0. 2 K/d. The effects of clouds on this longwave cooling are also explored by placing bounds on the possible impact of clouds on the <b>column</b> <b>cooling</b> rate based on certain assumptions about the effect of clouds on the longwave flux to the surface. It is shown how the longwave effects of clouds in a moist atmosphere where the column water vapor exceeds approximately 30 kg/sq m may be estimated from presently available satellite data with an uncertainty estimated to be approximately 0. 2 K/d.
