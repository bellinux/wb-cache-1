In this sense, the SIPEM suspension system is similar to the one used by the earlier SAFEGE system (which was developed in France and which is used on two networks in Japan), but is much narrower, both the <b>carrier</b> <b>box</b> as well as the open slit for the suspension.|$|E
50|$|The carrier is {{a hollow}} {{rectangular}} box girder with a slit {{in the bottom}} through which the cabin is suspended at the running gear, whose two axles carry the load with a rubber wheel on both sides providing both suspension and propulsion. Two wheels run horizontally along {{the top and bottom}} of the interior side walls of the <b>carrier</b> <b>box,</b> providing horizontal guidance. Thus, the designation as a monorail system is to be taken with a grain of salt, meaning just that there is a single axis of suspension.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The Farnsworth-Munsell (FM) 100 -hue test is {{well known}} but is also time consuming, {{especially}} its analytical component. To reduce this needless time-waste during precious working hours, a simple modification was devised. Design: Prospective, comparative, observational study. Materials and Methods: A transparent clear plastic <b>carrier</b> <b>box</b> replaced the opaque one, allowing ready digital photodocumentation of top and bottom without even opening the box, or handling/inverting the caps - 200 reportedly normals and 50 known color vision defectives could be easily tested on this modified-FM and results stored, allowing rapid turnover. The captured scores with patient ID were analyzed, at leisure, outside hospital time, saving 45 - 60 minutes/patient. After recording, the box was promptly {{handed over to the}} next subject for rearrangement. Times taken for test/patient were recorded. Results: Running time was reduced from 60 - 75 min to ~ 15 min/patient with no waste of invaluable lab hours. Turnover time is limited to capturing two photographs (~ 60 sec). The box is relatively cheap and easy to maintain. Conclusions: Our simplified FM 100 -hue test allowed rapid assessment of color visions with easy data storage of both top and bottom...|$|E

40|$|UAV {{technology}} is booming. Drone-based delivery services are an upcoming reality. German's parcel delivery company DHL has started applying them commercially. In this dissertation, several factors {{that control the}} delivery operations are identified and categorized. The leading companies in this field and their different strategies and techniques are studied. In the first phase, {{the focus is on}} identifying the ideal holding, locking and release mechanism that is efficient and cost-effective. The use of Electro-Permanent Magnet Gripper (EPM) has been examined in detail and tested. A 3 D model of the <b>carrier</b> <b>box</b> has been designed in CATIA as per HEMAV standard drone specifications. This box is manufactured through Fused Deposition Method (FDM) 3 D printing technology using PLA filament. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is done using ANSYS. Structural analysis indicated that this box can couple as legs for safer landing as well. This reduced the take-off time by 4 - 5 mins and the gross weight by 0. 5 kg. A step-by- step prototyping technique is documented and an experiment is carried out to test the real-time performance of this drone. The results are reported which showed good efficiency factors to operate drone delivery services. This model can hold greater payload, has a good range and speed with safe landing methods,withstanding the different climatic conditions. The proposed prototype is scalable and can be employed in product shipments, healthcare delivery network and many other sectors. It will make the deliveries happen faster and at more economical prices, thereby creating a supporting ecosystem...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} bachelor's thesis was {{to create}} various stages of project dokumentation–The Dokumentation for {{building}} permission and The Dokumentation for construction and The Study of the subject AG 35. Project involes a new building of The Industrial bakery Herold in the district Horni Herspice, on the land p. No. 1112 in the cadastral area of Brno. The bakery Herold has a headquarters in Slavkov u Brna and building of new object will ensure {{an expansion of the}} company's production, larger sales area and approach the area of the most extensive sales. This is a design of an industrial object, which is divided into 4 cubic mass. Main buildings consist of a production hall with stores and an expedition and the related administrative part. Two smaller objects are connected to the expedition part. There are hinterland, stores for a <b>carrier</b> <b>box</b> and a company store. The structural system of the administrative part consists of a modular system 6 x 6 m, 6 x 12 m or 6 x 24 m. The project also covers the surrounding area, especially the front space of the production hall, and a connection to the public infrastructure. The principle of the design is to place the object that way to ensure an economy of a construction, logic and a continuity of an internal road, to minimize an asphalt surface in the area and {{in front of the building}} and a suitable orientation to cardinal points. Because of near housing development there is the public space with trees in front the object. This space covers the building and makes visual and noise barrier. The entire area road is behind the object on the southern side. The building uses a mildly sloping land. The expedition part is 1, 100 m above neighboring ground and it is good for loading baked goods into the car. The purpose of this project is to create compact and functional building with interconnected rooms with a dry shod. A continuity of the production process was one of the most important elements in designing this building...|$|E

40|$|This study {{deals with}} {{unconventional}} bearing capacity analysis and the procedure of optimizing a two-cell box girder. The generalized model which enables the local stress-strain analysis of multicell girders was developed {{based on the}} principle of cross-sectional decomposition. The applied methodology is verified using the experimental data (Djelosevic et al., 2012) for traditionally formed box girders. The qualitative and quantitative evaluation of results obtained for the two-cell box girder is realized based on comparative analysis using the finite element method (FEM) and the ANSYS v 12 software. The deflection function obtained by analytical and numerical methods was found consistent provided that the maximum deviation does not exceed 4 %. Multicell box girders are rationally designed support structures characterized by much lower susceptibility of their cross-sectional elements to buckling and higher specific capacity than traditionally formed box girders. The developed local stress model is applied for optimizing the cross section of a two-cell <b>box</b> <b>carrier.</b> The author points to the advantages of implementing the model of local stresses in the optimization process and concludes that the technological reserve of bearing capacity amounts to 20 % at the same girder weight and constant load conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{report is}} part of the university´engineer program within Industrial Organization and Economics with {{specialization}} in Logistics and Managment at Jönköping´s university. Skoghall´s mill underlies a large supply chain, which means there should be a lot of areas in need of small improvement measures. This report illustrates a small part of one of these areas and is focused on the loading distribution services in the terminal Vänern. At the moment there´s a very unequal load of the load <b>carriers</b> SECU <b>box</b> and Container at the terminal. Skoghall´s mill has the desire to equalize the high and low load levels of the 2 loading carriers named previously. One of the options to solve the problem is to set a limit of how much the carriers can load per week or per day. The mill also wants it to be investigated if the proposition would influence the customers in any way and if both the company and its customers could handle a lower level of delivery services in case the proposition was to be applied. The goal to be achieved with this thesis is to provide balance to the unequall loading of the 2 load carriers, SECU and Container, and investigate whether or not the Skoghall´s mill´s customers, could manage the lower degree of delivery service that the proposition would imply. For this goal to be achieved, random sample investigations were taken from orders of a customer that is provided with SECU load carriers and the same was made with a Container´s customer. The orders were analysed from production to consumption on the investigation. As a result of random sample investigations and customers´s evaluations, the thesis shows {{that it is possible to}} lower the resources at Vänerterminalen. This means that there is a full possibility to limitate the loadingprocess without causing any major effects on Stora Enso´s customers. Further investigation should be made by the company, such as random sample investigations of more customers, to generate a better picture of what the proposition would mean in reality. In case that investigation turn out to be not in accordance with the thesis, the authors worked on other two solution propositions. Both of them also would contribute to a more even torrent of unloading at Vänerterminalen...|$|R
50|$|The Stoner 63/63A LMG is an {{automatic}} weapon that fires {{from the open}} bolt and the trigger mechanism permits only fully automatic firing though burst size can be controlled by the shooter. The entire trigger unit has four trigger pins that give the unit its modularity. The front pin holds a flapper-type magazine catch/release (used in the Rifle/Carbine variants and the left-hand feed LMG with a 150-round drum-type belt container), a full dust cover (used with the top-feeding Automatic Rifle or vertically mounted ammo box on any belt-fed system) or a half size dust cover (used with the right-hand-feed bottom <b>box</b> <b>carrier).</b> The next two pins retain the timer and hammer, {{both of which are}} absent in the open bolt configurations. The final pin acts as the trigger’s axis shaft; the spring-loaded sear pivots on the selector lever’s axis pin. The selector is disconnected when firing from the open bolt and a sliding manual safety installed near the trigger guard disables the trigger when pushed to the rear. The rear portion of the trigger housing serves as a receiver end cap and is used to attach the shoulder stock. The black polycarbonate pistol grip is also attached to the trigger housing. The checkered grip is flared at the bottom to prevent the shooter’s hand from sliding off and has an internal storage compartment sealed by a hinged cover with a spring-loaded hatch.|$|R

The temperatures could be adjusted for storage of vaccine and serum sample as well as making ice blocks that {{were used for the}} cool boxes. In addition, approximately 20 million doses of freeze-dried live attenuated PPR vaccine strain Nigeria 75 / 1 strain were competitively procured from a Jordan Bio-Industries Center(JOVAC®) with support of FAO. This vaccine is certified by the African Union’s Pan African Veterinary Vaccine Centre (AU/PANVAC), the only organisation mandated to provide international independent quality control of veterinary vaccines used in African countries.

5000|$|The Stoner 63/63A is {{chambered}} for the now-standard 5.56×45mm intermediate rifle cartridge. When in the belt-fed role, {{the weapon}} would feed from a disintegrating metallic linked belt marked [...] "S-63 BRW" [...] {{which is a}} scaled-down version of the U.S. M13 link developed for the M60 GPMG. The Stoner 63/63A will not work reliably with the later M27 link developed for the M249 SAW. The belt is normally contained in a 150-round plastic ribbed container that has a tab allowing it to be clipped on {{to the side of}} the left-hand feed tray. Early ammunition boxes were olive drab in color and manufactured at Costa Mesa, this later changed to a black-colored plastic container made in Warren, Michigan. Stoner 63A boxes were also black but had a reduced capacity of 100 rounds as the larger container would unbalance the rifle. These can either be attached to the left-hand feed tray or held in a bottom <b>box</b> <b>carrier</b> when using the right-hand feed mechanism. Several drum-type belt carriers were designed for the left-hand feed system, with a 150-round drum container being the most popular and used frequently by SEALS in Vietnam. A 250-round drum carrier was also developed by NAWS China Lake, but this proved too heavy and cumbersome. SEALS would also resort to converting RPD belt carriers for use with their Stoners. The detachable magazines used in the Rifle, Carbine and Automatic Rifle models are fabricated from steel and weigh 8 oz unloaded. In an effort to reduce weight, aluminum magazines were later developed cutting the weight down to 4 oz. Standard magazines have a 30-round cartridge capacity but a 20-round magazine was also offered.|$|R
