There his colleagues included Walther von Dyck, Rohn, Eduard Study and Friedrich Engel.

25|$|It was at Cambridge in 1785 that Clarkson {{entered a}} Latin essay {{competition}} {{that was to}} set him on the course {{for most of the}} remainder of his life. The topic of the essay, set by university vice-chancellor Peter Peckard, was Anne liceat invitos in servitutem dare ("Is it lawful to enslave the unconsenting?"), and it led Clarkson to consider the question of the slave trade. He read everything he could on the subject, including the works of Anthony Benezet, a Quaker abolitionist, as well as first hand accounts of the African slave trade such as Francis Moore's Travels into the Interior Parts of Africa. Appalled and challenged by what he discovered, Clarkson <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> <b>life.</b> He also researched the topic by meeting and interviewing those who had personal experience of the slave trade and of slavery.|$|E
25|$|Bakunin's {{increasing}} radicalism – including staunch {{opposition to}} imperialism in east and central Europe by Russia and other powers – <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> <b>life,</b> {{putting an end}} to hopes of a professorial career. He was eventually deported from France for speaking against Russia's oppression of Poland. In 1849, Bakunin was apprehended in Dresden for his participation in the Czech rebellion of 1848, and turned over to Russia where he was imprisoned in the Peter-Paul Fortress in Saint Petersburg. He remained there until 1857, when he was exiled to a work camp in Siberia. Escaping to Japan, the US and finally ending up in London for a short time, he worked with Alexander Herzen on the journal Kolokol (The Bell). In 1863, he left to join the insurrection in Poland, but he failed to reach his destination and instead spent some time in Switzerland and Italy.|$|E

500|$|Several {{video game}} clones were {{inspired}} by Knight Lore. When Edge Games struggled to approximate the isometric style internally, the visiting developer Bo Jangeborg devised his own solution. His result, Fairlight (1985), is regarded as another classic of the platform. Edge's version of Filmation received its own branding as [...] "Worldmaker". Shahid Ahmad said Firebird's Chimera (1985) was even closer to Knight Lore. Ahmad's [...] "shock" [...] and [...] "admiration" [...] from playing Knight Lore reportedly <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> and convinced him to continue making games. He released Chimera on the Amstrad CPC, Atari 8-bit, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum, customising each port for the processing limitations of its hardware. By 1986, many British video game publishers had produced Knight Lore-style isometric games; examples include Sweevo's World, Movie, Quazatron, Get Dexter, Glider Rider, Molecule Man, Spindizzy, and Bobby Bearing. Many of these titles suffered the same slowdown issues as Knight Lore due to too much on-screen activity.|$|E

[...] "Ni Tu Ni Yo" [...] is the only duet on the album, as it features Mexican ranchera singer Paquita la del Barrio. The song was composed so that when it is heard, it [...] "gives and immediate desire of drinking tequila" [...] according to Arjona. In an interview with newspaper Reforma, Arjona talked about the collaboration with Barrio, stating that [...] "it was very special, because she does not make duets with someone she does not like", agreeing {{that he did not}} duet either.

Particular parallels were made between Bloc Party and Gang of Four upon their arrival on the music scene, yet the band were [...] "mildly infuriated" [...] at such references, claiming they had never [...] "particularly liked" [...] Gang of Four. To achieve their unique style, numerous delay and other effects pedals are implemented. During the recording of second album A Weekend in the City, the band suggested it would contain [...] "some truly R styled beats, a song where [...] and [...] play drums simultaneously [...] both eggshell-thin fragility and trouser-flapping hugeness", as opposed to their typical sound. The style has been compared to and inspired by such bands as Radiohead, U2, Depeche Mode, and Björk. Some of the most noticeable changes between debut Silent Alarm and A Weekend in the City are that the songs became more layered and less raw due to inclusion of string arrangements.|$|E
