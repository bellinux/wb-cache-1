Particular attention is given to the study of bifurcation and stability in the vicinity of <b>critical</b> <b>flight</b> <b>speed</b> at which Hopf bifurcation occurs. The <b>critical</b> <b>flight</b> <b>speed</b> is defined in terms of the eigenvalues of the linearized system. Hopf bifurcation is associated with one pair of purely imaginary eigenvalues. Linear analysis is used to consider the stability of equilibrium solutions and the onset of bifurcations. Center manifold theory and normal form reduction technique are used to investigate the stability in the post-flutter regime. The effects of the time-delayed linear/nonlinear feedback controls on the aeroelastic response are investigated. Numerical simulations are carried out to verify the analytical predictions.

40|$|The {{exploration}} of Mars {{is an important}} part of the space exploration programs of the United States, the Soviet Union, Europe, and Japan. Many robotic spacecraft, including orbiters, landers, and rovers have been launched toward Mars since the 1960 s. These missions were aimed at gathering data about current conditions and answering questions about the history of Mars as well as a preparation for a possible human mission to Mars. The questions raised by the scientific community are expected to not only give a better appreciation of the red planet but also yield further insight into the past, and possible future, of Earth. In this context, taking into consideration other future means of exploration is a must. Since the Mars atmosphere is about 95. 3 % carbon dioxide, 2. 7 % nitrogen and 1. 6 % argon, the CO 2 in the Martian atmosphere may become an oxidizer of unconventional fuelled ramjets such as, in-situ manufactured silanes (Sin H 2 n+ 2) [1, 2]. Compared to a rocket 'hopper', ramjets using the Martian atmosphere may save on-board propellant and thus vehicle mass, a crucial issue, since any such vehicle must either be ferried from Earth, or built in situ. In a previous work [3] by these authors, a preliminary analysis for the feasibility of a hypersonic, CO 2 -breathing ramjet using silanes as fuel was demonstrated: in fact, assuming a total structural weight index of 21. 0 kgf/m 2 (weight index 7. 93 kgf/m 2 on Mars) and a cruise range of 5, 000 km yielded realistic solutions for current industrial materials and fabricating capabilities. In particular, for a 1 -metric ton payload, a take-off gross weigh (TOGW) of order 3. 2 ton, including the propellants needed to achieve ramjet operation turned out. In this paper, a detailed analysis of the engine flow path and of the cruise CL best conditions has been done. In fact, in order to define the optimal engine cycle (i. e., TBCC, RBCC) and combustor flow speed a Builder [4] analysis is performed. The <b>critical</b> <b>flight</b> <b>speed</b> above which the flow must become supersonic within the combustor is found to be 1600 m/s. The most favourable speed for cruise CL is found to be in the Mach range 6 - 7. This speed put this vehicle in the class of hypersonic vehicles with supersonic flow through the combustor...|$|E

Significant {{progress has been made}} in understanding the technical challenges of fully reusable launch systems and the accompanying management and operational approaches for achieving a low cost program. This paper reviews the current status of the RLV technology program including the DC-XA, X- 33 and X- 34 flight systems and associated technology programs. It addresses the specific technologies being tested that address the technical and operability challenges of reusable launch systems including reusable cryogenic propellant tanks, composite structures, thermal protection systems, improved propulsion and subsystem operability enhancements. The recently concluded DC-XA test program demonstrated some of these technologies in ground and flight test. Contracts were awarded recently for both the X- 33 and X- 34 flight demonstrator systems. The Orbital Sciences Corporation X- 34 flight test vehicle will demonstrate an air-launched reusable vehicle capable of <b>flight</b> to <b>speeds</b> of Mach 8.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the nocturnal flight {{behaviour}} of the common swift (Apus apus L.), {{by the use of}} a tracking radar. Birds were tracked from Lund University in southern Sweden during spring migration, summer roosting flights and autumn migration. <b>Flight</b> <b>speeds</b> were compared with predictions from flight mechanical and optimal migration theories. During spring, <b>flight</b> <b>speeds</b> were predicted to be higher than during both summer and autumn due to time restriction. In such cases, birds fly at a <b>flight</b> <b>speed</b> that maximizes the overall speed of migration. For summer roosting <b>flights,</b> <b>speeds</b> were predicted to be lower than during both spring and autumn since the predicted <b>flight</b> <b>speed</b> is the minimum power speed that involves the lowest energy consumption per unit time. During autumn, we expected <b>flight</b> <b>speeds</b> to be higher than during summer but lower than during spring since the expected <b>flight</b> <b>speed</b> is the maximum range speed, which involves the lowest energy consumption per unit distance. <b>Flight</b> <b>speeds</b> during spring were indeed higher than during both summer and autumn, which indicates time-selected spring migration. Speeds during autumn migration were very similar to those recorded during summer roosting flights. The general result shows that swifts change their <b>flight</b> <b>speed</b> between different <b>flight</b> behaviours to a smaller extent than expected.

40|$|Aerodynamic {{theories}} of bird flight predict that horizontal <b>flight</b> <b>speed</b> will increase with increasing load whereas vertical Eight speed will decrease. Horizontal <b>flight</b> <b>speed</b> for birds minimizing overall time on migration {{is predicted to}} be higher than <b>flight</b> <b>speed</b> for birds minimizing energy expenditure. In this study we compare <b>flight</b> <b>speeds</b> of Brent Geese Branta b. bernicla recorded by tracking radar and optical range finder during spring and autumn migration in southernmost Sweden, testing the above-mentioned predictions. Geese passing Sweden in spring are substantially heavier than in autumn and there might also be a stronger element of time-selection in spring than in autumn. Recorded airspeeds were significantly higher in spring (mean 19. 0 m s(- 1)) than in autumn (mean 17. 3 m s(- 1)), the average difference bring slightly larger than predicted due to the mass difference alone. The effects on airspeed of wind, vertical speed, flock size and altitude were also analysed, but none of these factors could explain the seasonal difference in airspeed. Hence, the results support the hypothesis of mass-dependent <b>flight</b> <b>speed</b> adjustment. The difference between the two seasons was not large enough to corroborate the hypothesis of a stronger element of time-selection in spring, but this hypothesis cannot be rejected.

40|$|One {{hundred and}} twenty Bos indicus cross steers were {{allocated}} to 3 treatments (good, mixed and poor) {{on the basis of}} <b>flight</b> <b>speed,</b> as a measure of cattle temperament. The cattle were lot-fed for 100 days and data collected at intervals on their temperament (<b>flight</b> <b>speeds)</b> and productivity (liveweight changes, body condition, pen feed intakes) during this time. After slaughter, data were collected on carcass traits and meat quality. Eating-quality attributes were measured in meat samples from 22 carcasses from each treatment. <b>Flight</b> <b>speeds</b> were highly correlated across animals and within treatments, showed little change in variability over time and were highly repeatable. <b>Flight</b> <b>speed</b> indicated a slight deterioration in temperament with time in the feedlot until day 70, suggesting an increasing fearfulness in the steers. Differences in <b>flight</b> <b>speeds</b> between treatments were maintained throughout the feedlotting period; poor-temperament animals retained poor temperaments and good retained good. <b>Flight</b> <b>speed</b> was correlated with measures of production, and <b>flight</b> <b>speed</b> measured at feedlot induction was a predictor of performance. Correlations and treatment effects showed that cattle with poor temperaments had poorer average daily gains, feed conversion efficiencies, body conditions and dressing percentages compared with those with good temperaments. Reduced performance in the poor-temperament animals may have resulted from their fearfulness and state of high arousal. Treatment (temperament grouping) did not influence carcass traits, but there was evidence of lower initial pH levels and indicators of 'heat-shortening' in the meat of steers with poor temperament compared with those with good temperament. These findings suggest that the poor temperament steers were more susceptible to pre-slaughter stressors than the good temperament animals. However, the meat quality differences were not detected in eating-quality measurements. ...|$|R

40|$|To {{obtain a}} full {{understanding}} of the aerodynamics of animal flight, the movement of the wings, the kinematics, needs to be connected to the wake left behind the animal. Here the detailed 3 D wingbeat kinematics of bats, Glossophaga soricina, flying in a wind tunnel over a range of <b>flight</b> <b>speeds</b> (1 - 7 m s(- 1)) was determined from high-speed video. The results were compared with the wake geometry and quantitative wake measurements obtained simultaneously to the kinematics. The wingbeat kinematics varied gradually with <b>flight</b> <b>speed</b> and reflected the changes observed {{in the wake of the}} bats. In particular, several of the kinematic parameters reflected the differences in the function of the upstroke at low and high <b>flight</b> <b>speeds.</b> At lower <b>flight</b> <b>speeds</b> the bats use a pitch-up rotation to produce a backward flick which creates thrust and some weight support. At higher speeds this mechanism disappears and the upstroke generates weight support but no thrust. This is reflected by the changes in e. g. angle of attack, span ratio, camber and downstroke ratio. We also determined how different parameters vary throughout a wingbeat over the <b>flight</b> <b>speeds</b> studied. Both the camber and the angle of attack varied over the wingbeat differently at different speeds, suggesting active control of these parameters to adjust to the changing aerodynamic conditions.

40|$|<b>Flight</b> <b>speed</b> is {{expected}} to increase with mass and wing loading among flying animals and aircraft for fundamental aerodynamic reasons. Assuming geometrical and dynamical similarity, cruising <b>flight</b> <b>speed</b> is predicted to vary as (body mass) (1 / 6) and (wing loading) (1 / 2) among bird species. To test these scaling rules and the general importance of mass and wing loading for bird <b>flight</b> <b>speeds,</b> we used tracking radar to measure flapping <b>flight</b> <b>speeds</b> of individuals or flocks of migrating birds visually identified to species as well as their altitude and winds at the altitudes where the birds were flying. Equivalent airspeeds (airspeeds corrected to sea level air density, Ue) of 138 species, ranging 0. 01 - 10 kg in mass, were analysed in relation to biometry and phylogeny. Scaling exponents in relation to mass and wing loading were significantly smaller than predicted (about 0. 12 and 0. 32, respectively, with similar results for analyses based on species and independent phylogenetic contrasts). These low scaling exponents {{may be the result of}} evolutionary restrictions on bird flight-speed range, counteracting too slow <b>flight</b> <b>speeds</b> among species with low wing loading and too fast speeds among species with high wing loading. This compression of speed range is partly attained through geometric differences, with aspect ratio showing a positive relationship with body mass and wing loading, but additional factors are required to fully explain the small scaling exponent of Ue in relation to wing loading. Furthermore, mass and wing loading accounted for only a limited proportion of the variation in Ue. Phylogeny was a powerful factor, in combination with wing loading, to account for the variation in Ue. These results demonstrate that functional flight adaptations and constraints associated with different evolutionary lineages have an important influence on cruising flapping <b>flight</b> <b>speed</b> that goes beyond the general aerodynamic scaling effects of mass and wing loading...|$|R
