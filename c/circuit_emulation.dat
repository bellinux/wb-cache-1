40|$|The memristor {{has been}} {{proposed}} as the fourth circuit element. Among the emerging nano-technologies, the memristor has become a very promising candidate for building storage structures because of its shorter switching time, higher capacity and lower power consumption. In this thesis, I will first introduce a new memristor model with controllable window functions, which is more authentic and flexible than those existing memristor models. Then I will present my novel design of a Memristor Content Addressable Memory (Memristor-CAM) structure {{that is based on}} my own design of Memristor-CAM cells. The major contribution of this work is the fuzzy look-up functionality, which is achieved by summing up the current of the matched cell lines in the Memristor-CAM. In addition, this fuzzy look-up functionality of the new Memristor-CAM design could be further extended in order to fit into a lot of practical applications. With the benefits of memristors, this Memristor-CAM storage structure could reduce the power consumption, increase the capacity and improve the performance of computer memory.

40|$|Living {{cells are}} able to produce {{a wide variety of}} {{biological}} responses when subjected to biochemical stimuli. It has become apparent that these biological responses are regulated by complex chemical reaction networks (CRNs). Unravelling the function of these circuits is a key topic of both systems biology and synthetic biology. Recent progress at the interface of chemistry and biology together with the realisation that current experimental tools are insufficient to quantitatively understand the molecular logic of pathways inside living cells has triggered renewed interest in the bottom-up development of CRNs. This builds upon earlier work of physical chemists who extensively studied inorganic CRNs and showed how a system of chemical reactions can give rise to complex spatiotemporal responses such as oscillations and pattern formation. Using purified biochemical components, in vitro synthetic biologists have started to engineer simplified model systems with the goal of mimicking biological responses of intracellular <b>circuits.</b> <b>Emulation</b> and reconstruction of system-level properties of intracellular networks using simplified circuits {{are able to}} reveal key design principles and molecular programs that underlie the biological function of interest.

30|$|For instance, B# [13] is {{a battery}} {{emulator}} {{based on an}} adjustable linear regulator which emulates the output battery voltages. It works {{in the range of}} 1.0 – 4.5 V and it can source a maximum current of 800 mA. The emulation board is controlled by means of a desktop computer running the Dualfoil electrochemical simulator for lithium-ion battery cells [14]. The main computer takes in input the current draw by the powered system and finds the corresponding voltage using a look-up table. S# [15] extends the B# architecture by adding a new front-end which allows the user to emulate a solar panel. In particular, S# can run either in the simulation mode or the emulation mode. In the simulation mode, it takes a current profile and a sunlight trace as inputs and generates a simulated power profile on the host computer. In the emulation mode, a real load is connected to the output of the <b>emulation</b> <b>circuit</b> and the solar model is written to the memory of the microcontroller which generates at run-time an appropriate voltage to drive the load. A similar approach is also presented by other authors which introduce solar panel <b>emulation</b> <b>circuits</b> controlled by means of a LabView PC [16 – 18].|$|R
50|$|In {{integrated}} <b>circuit</b> design, hardware <b>emulation</b> is {{the process}} of imitating the behavior of one or more pieces of hardware (typically a system under design) with another piece of hardware, typically a special purpose emulation system. The emulation model is usually based on a hardware description language (e.g. Verilog) source code, which is compiled into the format used by emulation system. The goal is normally debugging and functional verification of the system being designed. Often an emulator is fast enough to be plugged into a working target system in place of a yet-to-be-built chip, so the whole system can be debugged with live data. This is a specific case of in-circuit emulation.|$|R

This chip includes an RF-DC rectifier, low power analog to digital converter (ADC) and a resistor <b>emulation</b> <b>circuit</b> (REC).

40|$|This Final Report {{discusses}} work on {{an approach}} for analog emulation of large scale power systems using Analog Behavioral Models (ABMs) and analog devices in PSpice design environment. ABMs are models based on sets of mathematical equations or transfer functions describing {{the behavior of a}} circuit element or an analog building block. The ABM concept provides an efficient strategy for feasibility analysis, quick insight of developing top-down design methodology of large systems and model verification prior to full structural design and implementation. Analog emulation in this report uses an electric circuit equivalent of mathematical equations and scaled relationships that describe the states and behavior of a real power system to create its solution trajectory. The speed of analog solutions is as quick as the responses of the <b>circuit</b> itself. <b>Emulation</b> therefore is the representation of desired physical characteristics of a real life object using an electric circuit equivalent. The circuit equivalent has within it, the model of a real system as well as the method of solution.

The proposed approach allows simulation speed-up of 40 to 500 times {{as compared to the}} state-of-the-art in fault simulation. Average speedup provided by the method is 250 that is about an order of magnitude higher than previously cited in the literature.

40|$|Abstract—A {{method for}} {{adiabatic}} charging of a capacitor by Switched Capacitor Converters (SCC) with multiple target voltages is presented, analyzed and verified experimentally. The SCC automatically changes the target voltages from low to high and back, thereby emulating voltage steps. This reduces the energy losses due to small voltage deviations between the SCC output and the charged capacitor and by enabling the stored energy to be recovered {{back into the}} power supply. In comparison with the previous method a considerable economy in hardware is achieved by replacing a set of voltage sources by a single SCC. It is shown that the voltage source and the switch resistance in the regular charging circuit can be emulated by the SCC equivalent <b>circuit.</b> Furthermore, such <b>emulation</b> provides the same step response if the SCC is operated close to the no-charge (NC) mode. This theoretical prediction was approved experimentally using the binary SCC. I...|$|R

50|$|In {{computer}} {{networking and}} telecommunications, TDM over IP (TDMoIP) is the emulation of time-division multiplexing (TDM) over a {{packet switched network}} (PSN).

40|$|Photovoltaic (PV) module emulators, {{which can}} provide {{reproducible}} and controllable input power profile for a load device corresponding to different ambient {{conditions for a}} PV module, can significantly reduce the level of effort and cost for the development and optimization of the PV module, load devices, as well as interfacing power converters. In this paper, we introduce a dual-mode power regulator for the PV emulation. The dual-mode regulator consists of a voltage regulator and a current regulator, connected by two diodes for power hybridization. The circuit switches between the two regulators in order to accurately emulate the electrical output behavior of a PV module under different ambient conditions (e. g., solar irradiance, temperature) and load demands. The proposed regulator <b>circuit</b> provides accurate <b>emulation</b> results over the full operating range of the PV module by complementary use of the two regulators.

40|$|A {{hardware}} Trojan (HT) {{detection method}} is presented {{that is based}} on measuring and detecting small systematic changes in path delays introduced by capacitive loading effects or series inserted gates of HTs. The path delays are measured using a high resolution on-chip embedded test structure called a time-to-digital converter (TDC) that provides approx. 25 ps of timing resolution. A calibration method for the TDC as well as a chip-averaging technique are demonstrated to nearly eliminate chip-to-chip and within-die process variation effects on the measured path delays across chips, which simplifies the process and enhances the effectiveness of a simulation-based golden model. Path delay tests are applied to multiple copies of a 90 nm custom ASIC chip which incorporates two copies of an AES macro as well as a SPICE-level transient simulation model. The AES macros are exact replicas except for the insertion of several additional gates in the second hardware copy, which are designed to model HTs. Statistical detection methods are used to isolate and detect systematic changes introduced by these additional gates and a set of Trojan <b>emulation</b> <b>circuits</b> also inserted into the macros.

50|$|ATM {{supports}} {{different types}} of services via AALs. Standardized AALs include AAL1, AAL2, and AAL5, and the rarely used AAL3 and AAL4. AAL1 is used for constant bit rate (CBR) services and <b>circuit</b> <b>emulation.</b> Synchronization is also maintained at AAL1. AAL2 through AAL4 are used for variable bitrate (VBR) services, and AAL5 for data. Which AAL is in use for a given cell is not encoded in the cell.

5000|$|The AAL1gator was principally {{designed}} by the Network Synthesis CEO, Brian Holden and a consultant, Ed Lennox.

50|$|The CBR service {{category}} {{is used for}} connections that transport traffic at a constant bit rate, where there is an inherent reliance on time synchronisation between the traffic source and destination.

The amount of bandwidth {{is characterized by a}} Peak Cell Rate (PCR). These applications include services such as video conferencing, telephony (voice services) or any type of on-demand service, such as interactive voice and audio. For telephony and native voice applications CBR provides low-latency traffic with predictable delivery characteristics, and is therefore typically used for <b>circuit</b> <b>emulation.</b>|$|E
40|$|As {{the feature}} sizes {{continue}} {{to shrink in}} advanced VLSI technologies, the impact of process variations on yield losses has become significant. Moreover, the process variations in path delays are increasingly dependent on circuit context. Given this “neighborhood” dependence, characterization of path delays is best carried out using embedded techniques applied to actual product macros, as opposed to scribe line test structures or embedded ring oscillators (RO). In addition to characterizing performance, such delay measurement techniques {{can be used to}} improve model-to-hardware correlation. Furthermore, these techniques can also be used in several contexts including defect detection, post-silicon debug and hardware-security. In this dissertation, I propose a high-precision and low-overhead embedded test structure, called REBEL, for measuring path delays in the circuit context. REBEL is minimally invasive to the design, as it leverages the existing scan structures, and easy to integrate because it can be completely automated within the DFT synthesis flow. The proposed embedded test structure and two of it's applications, namely path delay variability characterization and hardware Trojan detection, are verified in silicon. REBEL architecture for both level sensitive scan design (LSSD) and MUX-D scan designs are proposed and verified in 90 nm ASICs and 130 nm FPGAs respectively. The LSSD-based REBEL structure is integrated into a 32 -bit pipelined floating point unit (FPU), implemented in IBM's 90 nm technology, and the path delay measurements from 62 copies of the chip are used to analyze die-to-die and within-die variations. The MUX- D-based REBEL is integrated into a pipelined Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) design and wrapped with random built-in self test (BIST) architecture. The system is then implemented in Xilinx Virtex 2 Pro FPGAs and the data collected from 30 copies of FPGA are used to analyze the variability in path delays. As a second application, REBEL's effectiveness for detecting delay anomalies introduced by Hardware Trojans is demonstrated. Trojan <b>emulation</b> <b>circuits,</b> designed to model internal wire loads introduced by a hardware Trojan, are inserted into the design at multiple places. The emulation cell incorporates an analog control pin to allow a variety of hardware Trojan loading scenarios to be investigated. Using the hardware data collected from 62 chips fabricated in 90 nm CMOS technology, I demonstrate that REBEL can detect the small delay anomalies introduced by hardware Trojans. I evaluate the detection sensitivity of REBEL for detecting hardware Trojans using linear regression analysis, which deals with the chip-to-chip variation effectively and improves the detection sensitivity.

40|$|Designing a {{new power}} {{electronic}} conversion {{system is a}} multi-step process that requires the R&D team(s) to go through an extended prototyping phase whose goal is to validate the design in its nominal state, {{as well as to}} test its behavior when it is subjected to abnormal conditions. To properly and safely validate all devices that are external to the power stage itself, such as the controllers and the protection systems, one of the best-suited device is a real-time emulator of the converter circuit, a platform that obeys the same mathematical laws and produces the same signals as the original device withoutactually realizing the power conversion. Unfortunately, these models are often based on analog solvers which are difficult to build, must be redesigned for each modification and are subject to drift and aging. While multiple digital real-time emulators have appeared on the market in the last decades, they typically require powerful and expensive computing platforms to perform their calculations or are not generic enough to emulate the more complex power circuits. In this work, we present a new framework that allows the rapid prototyping {{of a wide range of}} power converters by translating a power converter schematic drawn on a computer to a real-time equivalent set of equations which is processed by an FPGA with an emulation time-step of less than one microsecond. Contrary to the previously published works, our tools enable the use of entry-level FPGAs even for the <b>emulation</b> <b>circuits</b> composed of twenty switches or more. This framework takes the form of a tool-chain that starts by extracting the necessary information and a standard description from the initial circuit. However, due to the intricate ways in which the switches and diodes can change their state, this raw information is too complex to be processed and emulated directly. Our first major contribution to the state of the art is a way to automatically analyze these changes in order to reduce the complexity of the problem as much as possible while keeping all the necessary information intact. In this thesis, we develop two tools that are able to find all possible changes in the state of the switches that may appear in the immediate future, thereby reducing the quantity of information required to emulate the circuit. Thanks to the global optimization provided by our tools, simulating a typical AC-to-DC converter composed of 12 switches could require 80 % less resources when compared to existing emulators. To enable the emulation or large power converters, we have created a partitioning method which divides the circuit in multiple sub-circuits which are analyzed and optimized separately. The performances of this partitioning are demonstrated by the emulation of a three-phase three-level converter with a relative error of a less that 5...|$|R
50|$|The term ‘pseudowire’ {{comes from}} the IETF’s Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) working group, which is {{chartered}} to define a mechanism that emulate the essential attributes of services such as ATM, Frame Relay, Ethernet or <b>Circuit</b> <b>Emulation</b> over a Packet Switched Network (PSN). The goals of PWE3 are similar in many ways {{to what we have}} known for over a decade as ‘multiservice.’ The difference is that Ethernet, IP and MPLS have replaced ATM as the fundamental switching and transport technology. PWE3 working group was originally formed in mid-2001, although pseudowires were originally known as private wires (a little-known fact). Even so, the ideas behind pseudowires did not originate in 2001. Axerra Networks has {{been at the forefront of}} envisioning multiservice using Ethernet, IP and MPLS since before 1999. Axerra coined the terms Multiservice over IP (MSoIP), <b>Circuit</b> <b>Emulation</b> Service over IP (CESoIP), Frame Relay over IP (FRoIP), and ATM over IP (ATMoIP) - and still owns the Internet domain names and trademarks for these terms. Thus, Axerra has been an early innovator of pseudowire technology and a leading contributor to the PWE3 standardization efforts rapidly reaching fruition in PWE3, as well as ITU-T, the Broadband Forum (BBF), and the Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF), bode well for the adoption of pseudowire technology by the service provider industry. Axerra understands that pseudowire is simply a new term for the next generation of multiservice - multiservice over IP and MPLS. Based on its experience in this technology, predating even its new name, and based on contributions to these standardization efforts, Axerra is well positioned to lead service providers’ uptake of pseudowires networking.|$|E
