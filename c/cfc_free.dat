40|$|Ecofrig {{opened up}} an environmental-friendly option of Chlorofluorocarbon (<b>CFC)</b> <b>free</b> {{technology}} hitherto unknown in India and achieved {{a level playing}} field for Hydrocarbons (HCs) vs. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in view of informed decisions in private industry in implementing the Montreal Protocol. Ten key factors of success are identified, among them (1) the creation of a process leading to ownership of the HC-technology with the Indian partners, (2) the commercial competitiveness of the HCs, (3) the commitment of all partners at the institutional and human level. Lessons learnt mainly address market failures, the role of the Multilateral Fund (MF) and the growing influence of multinational companies (MNCs). Despite considerable relevance of Ecofrig {{for the protection of the}} Ozone layer, for the slowing down of climate change and for poverty reduction, there still is unfinished business.

Dry powder inhalers (DPI) for beclomethasone dipropionate were prepared with different grades of lactose monohydrate. The influence of carrier and overages on performance of DPI was studied. Metered dose inhalers (MDI) with HFA based propellants were formulated with various doses, overages and different concentrations of alcohol. Formulated DPI and MDI were evaluated for various official and unofficial quality control tests. The influence of over doses on valve delivery, effect of overages on emitted dose and influence of alcohol on spray pattern from MDI were studied. The better fine particle fraction and emitted dose were obtained from the DPI formulated with 10 : 90 ratio of fine lactose: coarse lactose and with 20 % w/w overages. The studies on MDI revealed that the 15 % of overdoses are required for effective valve delivery and 20 % overages are required for 100 % drug delivery. 5 - 10 %v/v alcohol was found to be preferable to get optimum emitted dose and fine particle fraction...|$|E
40|$|The four system {{conditions}} for sustainability presented in Holmberg’s Ph. D. dissertation (1995) provided {{a foundation for}} the approach used by the ‘Natural Step’ both in Sweden and in several other countries (e. g. Holmberg & Robért 2000). In the 1990 s Holmberg & Robért developed a ‘backcasting’ approach to strategy development in companies and was involved in several projects to introduce sustainability defined by these four system conditions. This work had a considerable impact in several firms. Electrolux established an environmental policy and a direct effect of backcasting was a decision to develop the first <b>CFC</b> <b>free</b> refrigerators, which put the company far ahead of their competitors. This {{is just one example}} that illustrates how this approach has a potential to stimulate new directions, which would not happen based on a more traditional trend-based analysis. Although these projects have been showing good results, several firms have lost their focus for working with sustainability after some time. So the question remained – how can sustainability become a natural part of strategy processes and practices in companies? An action research project was initiated in 2004 to focus on this question at three large Swedish corporations. The project aim was to further develop the backcasting approach in the context of sustainable development and to present recommendations for the process of implementation of the approach at companies. This paper discusses alternative ways of using and integrating the sustainability concept and approaches/practices in firms. The research design was an action learning approach to develop robust sustainable strategies in business units of three major firms. Representatives from the firms participated in workshops to learn together and share experiences from on-going projects in each company. Interviews were used to provide additional understanding of strategy processes within each firm. The conclusion was that sustainability can impact all parts and all processes in a firm. As a vision it is an organizing metaphor but there are also various accompanying techniques and practices. Firms choose to approach sustainability in different ways. Some view it as a major assignment for the environmental department supported by central policy committees. Others start out from the perspective that sustainability should be part of what everyone does in their normal job. In the latter case, the parallel to quality is obvious – when it really works and becomes totally integrated in the daily work - in product development, supply chain, etc. - then it becomes the paradoxical ‘invisible success’ (Book et al. 2004, Book 2006). One general observation is that it takes time to develop a thorough sustainability approach. It can be useful to view the development as a learning process where top management involvement and understanding of the link between competitive advantage and sustainability can facilitate and help speeding up the process. For strategy driven companies, the starting point is to make sustainability part of the regular strategy process, reaching the status of critical success factor. Then, {{there is a need for}} non-traditional strategy tools, such as scenario-planning and backcasting. The specific advantage of using the four system conditions as the conceptualization of sustainability is that they can be used on different levels and in different processes in an organization. First, they can provide input to different strategy processes. Second, they can support individuals’ decision-making in their daily work, e. g. choose alternatives that do not systematically increase the number of new substances in the stratosphere...|$|E

40|$|Most {{bacteria}} grow {{in nature}} forming multicellular structures named biofilms. The bacterial second messenger cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) {{is a key}} player in the regulation of the transition from planktonic to sessile lifestyles and this regulation is crucial in the development of biofilms. In Pseudomonas putida KT 2440, Rup 4959, a multidomain response regulator with diguanylate cyclase activity, when overexpressed causes an increment in the intracellular levels of c-di-GMP that gives rise to a pleiotropic phenotype consisting of increased biofilm formation and crinkly colony morphology. In a broad genomic screen we have isolated mutant derivatives that lose the crinkly morphology, designed as <b>cfc</b> (crinkle <b>free</b> colony). A total of 19 different genes have been identified as being related with the emergence of the cfc phenotype either because the expression or functionality of Rup 4959 is compromised, or {{due to a lack of}} transduction of the c-di-GMP signal to downstream elements involved in the acquisition of the phenotype. Discernment between these possibilities was investigated by using a c-di-GMP biosensor and by HPLC-MS quantification of the second messenger. Interestingly five of the identified genes encode proteins with AAA+ ATPase domain. Among the bacterial determinants found in this screen are the global transcriptional regulators GacA, AlgU and FleQ and two enzymes involved in the arginine biosynthesis pathway. We present evidences that this pathway seems to be an important element to both the availability of the free pool of the second messenger c-di-GMP and to its further transduction as a signal for biosynthesis of biopolimers. In addition we have identified an uncharacterized hybrid sensor histidine kinase whose phosphoaceptor conserved histidine residue has been shown in this work to be required for in vivo activation of the orphan response regulator Rup 4959, which suggests these two elements constitute a two-component phosphorelay system.
