50|$|An intrauterine device (IUD) {{is a small}} <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device,</b> often 'T'-shaped and {{containing}} either copper or {{the hormone}} levonorgestrel, which is implanted into the uterus. They are long-acting, reversible, and the most effective types of reversible birth control. Failure rates with the copper IUD is about 0.8% while the levonorgestrel IUD has a failure rate of 0.2% {{in the first year}} of use. Among types of birth control they, along with birth control implants, result in the greatest satisfaction among users. As of 2011, IUDs are the most widely used form of reversible contraception worldwide. IUDs also tend to be one of the most cost-effective methods of contraception for women.|$|E

Haire became involved in another birth control clinic that opened in Walworth in November 1921; later a rivalry between Stopes and Haire erupted in The Lancet. Haire brought up the gold-pin episode, even though Stopes' clinic had never used it. The issue of the gold pin device resurfaced in the Stopes-Sutherland libel case a few years later.|$|E
50|$|While {{one study}} which {{utilized}} mice models indicated that acrosin {{is not a}} necessary component of zona pellucida penetration, other studies in humans have shown an association between low acrosomal proteinase activity and infertility. Other research groups have demonstrated a significant correlation between acrosin activity and sperm motility. In rabbit models, an intravaginal <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> that secreted tetradecyl sodium sulfate, a known inhibitor of acrosin and hyaluronidases, had a complete contraceptive effect. Although its exact mechanism of action is not entirely clear, acrosin could thus serve as a novel target for contraceptive agents. Acrosin may represent as a uniquely druggable target due to its location and high cellular specificity. Thus, developing inhibitors of acrosin could {{provide the basis for}} safe, reversible male contraceptives, or female contraceptives through the use of intravaginal contraceptive devices.|$|E

50|$|Cusco's self {{retaining}} bivalved speculum is {{a surgical}} instrument used for vaginal and cervical examination. It has a jaw which opens {{up like a}} duck bill. It comes in three models : side scew, centre screw and in special narrow virgin size. The Cusco's speculum is usually 80mm long and 22 mm broad. However, smaller and larger sizes are available. Cusco's speculum is used for introducing an intrauterine <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device,</b> taking a Pap smear, cauterization of vaginal erosion and for colposcopic examination. It is preferred in cryosurgery because it protects the anterior and posterior vaginal wall. The advantage of Cusco's speculum {{is that it is}} self-retaining. Therefore, an assistant's help is not needed to keep the speculum in place. It also acts as the vaginal wall retractor. However, it reduces the space in the vaginal cavity and therefore is not a preferred instrument for vaginal surgery. Since it covers most of the vaginal wall, small lesions on the vaginal wall may be masked by the blades of the device.|$|E

40|$|Background: Intrauterine <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> is {{the most}} common method of {{reversible}} contraception in women. The intrauterine <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> can perforate the uterus and can also migrate into pelvic or abdominal organs. Perforation of the urinary bladder by an intrauterine <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> is not common. In West Africa, intravesi‑ cal migration of an intrauterine <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> has been rarely reported. In this report, we present a case of an intrauterine <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> migration into the urinary bladder of a 33 year old African woman at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, Kumasi, Ghana. Case report: A 33 year old African woman presented with persistent urinary tract infection of 7 months duration despite appropriate antibiotic treatments. An abdominal ultrasonography revealed a urinary bladder calculus which was found to be an intrauterine <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> on removal at cystoscopy. She got pregnant whilst having the intrauterine <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> in place and delivered at term. Conclusion: The presence of recurrent or persistent urinary tract infection in any woman with an intrauterine contra‑ ceptive device should raise the suspicion of intravesical migration of the intrauterine <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device...</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: Use {{of modern}} {{contraceptive}} methods {{has been shown}} to reduce unwanted pregnancy, high parity and maternal mortality. Intrauterine contraceptive devices which are among the safest and most effective reversible contraceptives available, are particularly suitable for women in developing countries as they are affordable, convenient to use, do not require re-supply visits and are very cost-effective. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the socio-demographic characteristics of intrauterine <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> acceptors, the pattern of insertions and complications at the University of Uyo Teaching hospital, Uyo. Method: The record cards of all clients who had intrauterine <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> inserted at the family planning clinic over a six-year period were reviewed. Results: During the study period, there were 852 new contraceptive acceptors out of which 39. 7 &#x 0025; accepted the intrauterine <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device.</b> The modal age group of the clients was 25 - 29 years (32. 5 &#x 0025;). Acceptance of intrauterine <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> was most common among multiparous clients (65. 1 &#x 0025;). Majority of the acceptors were married (90. 0 &#x 0025;), Christians (98. 8 &#x 0025;) and 72. 8 &#x 0025; had at least secondary school education. Clinic personnel (65. 7 &#x 0025;) and friends/relatives (21. 3 &#x 0025;) were the most common sources of information on contraception. Most (93. 5 &#x 0025;) of the clients had their intrauterine contraceptive devices inserted within 7 days of menstruation. Lower abdominal pain (5. 5 &#x 0025;) and vulval/vaginal itching (5. 3 &#x 0025;) were the most common complications. Conclusion: The acceptors of intrauterine contraceptive devices in our center were young, multiparous and educated women. Increasing mass media involvement in the dissemination of accurate information about intrauterine contraceptive devices to the general populace, the introduction of postpartum and post-abortal intrauterine <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> insertions and the encouragement of our grandmultiparous women to accept intrauterine <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> would lead to an increase in its acceptance and use...|$|E
40|$|Background: Substantial {{evidence}} supports a causal {{relationship between the}} risk of human breast cancer and levels of endogenous estrogens. Aim: To evaluate the urinary estrogen of women on contraceptives and also compare the levels in two different classes of contraceptives; hence, the possible predisposition of such women {{to the risk of}} breast cancer. Setting and Design: Urinary estrogen level was evaluated in 84 women attending family planning clinic in University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital Enugu, Nigeria, who have been on <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> for 10 years or less (≤ 10 years). They were aged between 21 and 50 years and were divide into three groups (21 - 30 years, 31 - 40 years, and > 40 years). The control group consisted of 30 age-matched apparently-healthy women who were not on any <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device.</b> Materials and Methods: Estrogen was analyzed using Ecologenia; Estrogen (E 1 /E 2 /E 3) microplate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit, Batch No. T 2 GR 4, from Japan Envirochemicals Ltd, Japan. Statistical Analysis Used: Significant differences between means were determined by two-tailed Student′s t-test using graph pad prism computer software program. Result: There was a statistically significant increase (P= 0. 0462), in the mean urinary estrogen level of women on contraceptives when compared with the control. The highest amount of estrogen was excreted by the women in the 21 - 30 years age group. When the contraceptive devices were divided into two classes of intra-uterine device and oral/injectables, there was no statistical difference (P= 0. 8112) in the mean urinary estrogen output of the women. Conclusion: The synthetic estrogen content of <b>contraceptive</b> <b>device</b> most probably contributed to the level excreted in the urine.
