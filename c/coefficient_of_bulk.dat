The temperature dependence of diffusion of THO, C 14 -urea, C 14 -thiourea, and net water transfer across the bladder was determined in the presence and absence of vasopressin. The activation energy for diffusion of THO was 9. 8 kcal per mole in the absence of vasopressin and 4. 1 kcal per mole with the hormone present. Activation energies simultaneously determined following vasopressin for diffusion and net transfers of water were similar, and in the same range as known activation energies for diffusion and viscous flow in water.
