2500|$|The grating {{equation}} {{shows that}} the angles of the diffracted orders only depend on the grooves' period, and not on their shape. By controlling the <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>profile</b> of the grooves, {{it is possible to}} concentrate most of the diffracted energy in a particular order for a given wavelength. A triangular profile is commonly used. This technique is called blazing. The incident angle and wavelength for which the diffraction is most efficient are often called blazing angle and blazing wavelength. [...] The efficiency of a grating may also depend on the polarization of the incident light. Gratings are usually designated by their groove density, the number of grooves per unit length, usually expressed in grooves per millimeter (g/mm), also equal to the inverse of the groove period. The groove period must be on the order of the wavelength of interest; the spectral range covered by a grating is dependent on groove spacing and is the same for ruled and holographic gratings with the same grating constant. The maximum wavelength that a grating can diffract is equal to twice the grating period, in which case the incident and diffracted light will be at ninety degrees to the grating normal. To obtain frequency dispersion over a wider frequency one must use a prism. In the optical regime, in which the use of gratings is most common, this corresponds to wavelengths between 100 nm [...] and 10 µm. In that case, the groove density can vary from a few tens of grooves per millimeter, as in echelle gratings, to a few thousands of grooves per millimeter.|$|E

Concave and convex longitudinal profiles were observed at Bahram and Tyras Valles, respectively, while no general trend was visible at other valleys. The longitudinal profiles also {{showed signs of}} knickpoints and some short reaches with increasing elevation in the flow direction. The <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>profiles</b> of Tyras Valles show more V-shaped of upper and U-shaped of lower reaches, but the great variety of profiles of other channels suggests a complex relationship with the regional lithology/topography. Also at Tyras Valles the longitudinal profiles could be divided into {{upper and lower sections}} that probably formed at different periods under different conditions. The largest observed valleys contain small, previously unnoticed inner channels. There is no correlation between the shape of <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>profiles</b> and the direction of curvature of the valley’s long axis (left/right or straight), as is found in riverbeds on the Earth, suggesting that the analyzed depressions are probably valleys and not dry riverbeds, but substantial wind-blown sedimentary infill could have modified their shape too.

40|$|The {{anisotropic}} etching behavior of quartz crystal in concentrated ammonium bifluoride solution is studied and analyzed {{in the framework}} of a tensorial model. This model allows to simulate bi- or three-dimensional etching shapes from the equation for the representative surface of the dissolution slowness. In this paper, we present experimental results such as surface profile and initially circular <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>profiles</b> of differently singly- or doubly-rotated cuts. The polar diagrams of the dissolution slowness vector in several planes are deduced from experimental data. The comparison between predicted surface and <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>profiles</b> and experimental results is detailed and shows a good agreement. In particular, several examples give evidence that the final etched shapes are correlated to the extrema of the dissolution slowness. However, in several cases, experimental shapes cannot be simply correlated to the presence of extrema. Simulation gives effectively evidence for an important role played by more progressive changes in the curvature of the slowness surface. Consequently, analysis of data merits to be treated carefully...|$|R

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of the thesis is to study {{localization}} of Laplacian eigenfunctions in bounded domains when an eigenfunction is mainly supported by a small region of the domain and vanishing outside this region. The high-frequency and low-frequency localization in simple and irregular domains has been investigated for both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Three types of high-frequency localization (whispering gallery, bouncing ball, and focusing eigemodes) have been revisited in circular, spherical and elliptical domains by deriving explicit inequalities on the norm of eigenfunctions. In turn, no localization {{has been found in}} most rectangular domains that led to formulating an open problem of characterization of domains that admit high-frequency localization. Using the Maslov-type differential inequalities, the exponential decay of low-frequency Dirichlet eigenfunctions has been extensively studied in various domains with branches of variable <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>profiles.</b> Under an explicit condition, the L 2 -norm of an eigenfunction has been shown to exponentially decay along the branch with an explicitly computed decay rate.
