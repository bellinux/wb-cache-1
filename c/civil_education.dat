25|$|Along with Guy Strait, Sarria {{formed the}} League for <b>Civil</b> <b>Education</b> (LCE) in 1960 or 1961. The LCE ran {{educational}} {{programs on the}} topic of homosexuality and provided support for men being ostracized for being gay and for those caught in police raids. In 1962, Sarria along with bar owners and employees formed the Tavern Guild, the country's first gay business association. The Guild raised money for legal fees and bail for people arrested at gay bars and helped bar owners coordinate their response to the harassment of the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control and the police. Sarria continued to perform and agitate at the Black Cat until, after some 15years of unrelenting police pressure, the bar lost its liquor license in 1963.|$|E
500|$|Sarria {{served in}} the United States Army during World War II. Following his discharge, he studied to become a teacher and frequented the Black Cat. He met waiter Jimmy Moore, whom Sarria {{described}} as [...] "the love of [...] life". Sarria {{was hired as a}} cocktail waiter. Following a conviction on a morals charge, Sarria, realizing he could not now become a certified teacher, began performing in drag. He appeared regularly at the Black Cat. An early LGBT activist, Sarria co-founded several homophile organizations, including the League for <b>Civil</b> <b>Education,</b> the Tavern Guild and the Society for Individual Rights. Sarria became the first openly gay candidate for public office in the United States when he ran for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1961. In 1964 Sarria declared himself [...] "Empress José I, The Widow Norton" [...] and founded the Imperial Court System, which grew to become an international association of charitable organizations.|$|E
500|$|Jose Sarria {{fought against}} police harassment, both of gays and of gay bars. Raids on gay bars were routine, with {{everyone}} inside the raided bar {{taken into custody}} and charged with such crimes as being [...] "inmates in a disorderly house". Although the charges were routinely dropped, the arrested patrons' names, addresses and workplaces were printed in the newspapers. When charges were not dropped, the arrested men usually quietly pleaded guilty. Sarria encouraged men to plead not guilty and demand a jury trial. Following Sarria's advice, more and more gay men began demanding jury trials, so many that court dockets were overloaded and judges began expecting that prosecutors have actual evidence against the accused before going to trial. One favored harassment technique, employed especially on Halloween after midnight, was to arrest drag queens under an old city ordinance that made it illegal {{for a man to}} dress in women's clothing with an [...] "intent to deceive". In consultation with attorney Melvin Belli, Sarria countered this tactic by distributing labels to his fellow drag queens (hand-made, {{in the shape of a}} black cat's head) that read [...] "I am a boy". If confronted, the queen would simply display the tag to prove that there was no intent to deceive. Sarria's actions helped bring an end to Halloween police raids. Along with Guy Strait, Sarria formed the League for <b>Civil</b> <b>Education</b> (LCE) in 1960 or 1961. The LCE ran educational programs on the topic of homosexuality and provided support for men being ostracized for being gay and for those caught in police raids.|$|E
