5|$|After the crash, both Crossair and CCP, {{including}} the pilots {{who had previously}} spoken {{to the media and}} been fired, publicly stated that the coincidence between the accident and the dispute was very unfortunate and that reports about pilot error being involved in the crash were speculation, although this <b>conclusion</b> <b>was</b> later established to be the probable cause of the accident.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the Filipino Premier League (FPL) was {{established}} as the top-flight {{competition in the}} Philippines. It featured eight clubs from the National Capital Region. The PFF also planned a Visayas and Mindanao FPL tournament in 2009, which never materialized. The first and only champion of the league, which was cancelled at the season's <b>conclusion,</b> <b>was</b> the Philippine Army.|$|E

5|$|Large {{numbers of}} people participated in solving the puzzles within the ARG.

5|$|Sabotage by {{a disgruntled}} crewman.

5|$|As it was, Heilmann's <b>conclusion</b> <b>was</b> so persuasive that it forestalled further {{debate on}} the subject {{even in the face}} of {{additional}} conflicting evidence. In 1936, paleontologist Charles Lewis Camp described a new theropod from the Jurassic of North America, Segisaurus. Like Oviraptor, Segisaurus had an unmistakable clavicle, but unlike Oviraptor, it was also plainly identified as being such in the paper that described it. Despite this, the implication of a wishbone-bearing dinosaur was blatantly ignored until much later, and for many years the state of dinosaur research stagnated, possibly due to the effects of the Depression and World War II.|$|E

50|$|A {{deductive}} {{argument is}} one that, if valid, has a <b>conclusion</b> that <b>is</b> entailed by its premises.

5|$|Hundreds of {{emergency}} personnel {{responded to the}} crash site and helped save victims. Many of those who survived were severely injured and required months or years to physically recover. NTSB investigators looked at various factors {{that contributed to the}} crash. The failures of the flight crew were cited as the probable cause of the crash, but the weather, air traffic controller performances, and FAA traffic management were also cited as contributing to the events that led to the accident. This <b>conclusion</b> <b>was</b> controversial, with disagreement between investigators, passengers, and Avianca as to who was ultimately responsible. Eventually, the U.S. government joined with Avianca and settled to pay for the damages to the victims and their families. The crash was also portrayed in a variety of media.|$|E
5|$|On April 13, 2017, NASA {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} possible hydrothermal activity on Enceladus' sub-surface ocean floor. In 2015, the Cassini probe made a close fly-by of Enceladus' south pole, flying within 48.3km (30mi) of the surface, {{as well as through}} a plume in the process. A mass spectrometer on the craft detected molecular hydrogen (H2) from the plume, and after months of analysis, the <b>conclusion</b> <b>was</b> made that the hydrogen was most likely the result of hydrothermal activity beneath the surface. It has been speculated that such activity could be a potential oasis of habitability.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Baxter, {{the leading}} case on {{derivative}} governmental immunity in Australia was the 1979 High Court judgment in Bradken Consolidated Ltd v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd. In Bradken, the High Court upheld {{a claim for}} derivative governmental immunity by equipment suppliers to the Queensland Commissioner for Railways. The majority's <b>conclusion</b> <b>was</b> that if the Queensland government was immune from the TPA, it would prejudice the Queensland government if the contracts and arrangements it entered were subject to the TPA through the other parties to the contracts and arrangements.|$|E

5|$|Subsequently, {{there was}} {{considerable}} confusion over the difference between columbium (niobium) and the closely related tantalum. In 1809, English chemist William Hyde Wollaston compared the oxides derived from both columbium—columbite, with a density 5.918g/cm3, and tantalum—tantalite, with a density over 8g/cm3, {{and concluded that the}} two oxides, despite the significant difference in density, were identical; thus he kept the name tantalum. This <b>conclusion</b> <b>was</b> disputed in 1846 by German chemist Heinrich Rose, who argued that there were two different elements in the tantalite sample, and named them after children of Tantalus: niobium (from Niobe) and pelopium (from Pelops). This confusion arose from the minimal observed differences between tantalum and niobium. The claimed new elements pelopium, ilmenium, and dianium were in fact identical to niobium or mixtures of niobium and tantalum.|$|E
5|$|The XJ220 was not {{initially}} {{intended to be}} a production car, but, following the reception of the concept and financial interest from serious buyers, a feasibility study was carried out by teams from TWR and Jaguar. Its <b>conclusion</b> <b>was</b> that such a car would be technically feasible (subject to engineering changes), {{and that it would be}} financially viable. The announcement of a limited production run of 220 to 350 cars came on 20 December 1989. The list price on 1 January 1990 was £290,000 exclusive of value added tax, options and delivery charges, but by 1992 that had increased considerably owing to indexation of contracts. The offer was four times oversubscribed, and deposits of £50,000 exclusive of Value Added Tax (VAT) were taken from around 1400 customers; first deliveries were planned for mid-1992.|$|E
5|$|The press had an {{aggressive}} {{coverage of the}} accident. Several major press organizations attended the memorial service, and newspapers published close-up pictures of crying next of kin on their front pages. The Norwegian Press Complaints Commission, a committee appointed by the newspapers themselves, acquitted Dagbladet after a complaint for their aggressive image use. However, the accident coverage started an internal debate among journalists about their coverage of major accidents. The <b>conclusion</b> <b>was</b> that private sorrow {{was not to be}} covered in the media and since the media has had a strict self-enforcement of such a policy.|$|E
40|$|Reference is made {{to recent}} studies by Barnes et al. (1983) and Hide (1984) in which a <b>conclusion</b> <b>is</b> made that {{atmospheric}} excitation alone is sufficient {{to account for the}} earth's polar motion over the studied periods. It is then shown through a physical 'thought' experiment and a numerical simulation that this <b>conclusion</b> <b>is</b> unjustified since the information about the Chandler wobble presented in these papers is insufficient. Whether the <b>conclusion</b> <b>is</b> true or not, however, remains an open question...|$|R

50|$|One of White's <b>conclusions</b> <b>is</b> that no {{one system}} of {{government}} is obviously more murderous, and anarchy can be worst of all.

5|$|The {{report also}} noted {{concerns}} about the District's conclusion that the water withdrawals will have few deleterious ecological effects. This <b>conclusion</b> <b>was</b> based on the model findings that increased flows from upper basin projects and from changes in land use (increases in impervious areas) largely compensated for the impacts of water withdrawals on water flows and levels. Although the upper basin projects are positive insofar as they will return land to the basin (and water to the river), the same cannot be said about increased urban runoff, the poor quality of which is well known.|$|E
5|$|Though Ogbu's 1978 study's <b>conclusion</b> <b>was</b> widely discussed, a 2003 {{work also}} {{challenged}} its validity. In 2003, Karolyn Tyson, a sociologist, and William Darity, Jr., an economist, of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, conducted an 18-month study at 11 North Carolina schools. The {{study concluded that}} white and black students have essentially the same attitudes about scholastic achievement; students in both groups want to succeed in school and show higher levels of self-esteem when they do better in school. They compared attitudes identified as acting white to the normal adolescent pains experienced in John Hughes' movies.|$|E
5|$|According to Alexander H. Smith's {{organization}} of the genus Mycena, M.aurantiomarginata is classified in section Calodontes, subsection Granulatae, which contains species with roughened cheilocystidia (cystidia on gill edges), such as M.rosella, M.flavescens, M.elegans, and M.strobilinoides. In his 1992 study of Mycena, Dutch mycologist Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus put M.aurantiomarginata in the section Luculentae, characterized by species with an olive to yellowish-olive and moist cap, pallid to gray-olive gills with bright orange margins, brownish to grayish-olive stipes, white spore deposit, and spiny cystidia. M.aurantiomarginata was included in a 2010 molecular analysis focused on clarifying the phylogenetic relationships between Northern European species in the section Calodontes. The results suggested that, based on the similarity of nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA sequences, the fungus {{is closely related to}} M.crocata and M.leaiana. This <b>conclusion</b> <b>was</b> previously corroborated by research that used molecular analysis to demonstrate that several Mycena species can be mycorrhizal partners of the orchid Gastrodia confusa.|$|E

5|$|By the 1960s, {{even before}} the {{increase}} of abuse of the Case Stated procedure, the United Kingdom {{was estimated to be}} losing £500 million a year through the movement of arbitration business to other countries. In response, the Lord Chancellor convened a Commercial Court Users Conference in 1960, and tasked them with reviewing the system; the <b>conclusion</b> <b>was</b> that the status quo should remain. With the increased use of the Case Stated procedure, more calls for reform came. In June 1977 the London Arbitration Group (LAG) was formed, taking it upon itself to make the government aware of the damage current law was causing. In 1978, in reaction to the continued pressure, the Lord Chancellor established a Commercial Court Committee to again look at the issue; their report, in June 1978, recommended changing the system so that appeal was only allowed when either the High Court permitted it, or both parties to the arbitration agreed it was necessary. This was intended to ensure that any new Act of Parliament fulfilled two roles – firstly, decreasing the use of the Case Stated procedure, and secondly, encouraging arbitrators to give reasons for their decisions.|$|E
5|$|In about 1143 Foliot {{wrote an}} account of the {{proceedings}} of the council in a letter to one of Matilda's supporters. No action was taken on her claim, and no <b>conclusion</b> <b>was</b> reached as to its validity. The papacy continued to accept Stephen as king, and the pope ordered the English Church to make no changes to the status quo. According to Foliot's letter the council's deliberations centred on the legitimacy of the marriage between Matilda's parents. Matilda's mother, Edith-Matilda, had been educated at a convent, and there was some uncertainty over whether she had taken vows before her marriage to Henry I. At the time of the council, the question caused some concern, although in time most were persuaded that the marriage was valid because Anselm of Canterbury had performed the ceremony. Foliot seems to have had some doubts in 1139, but before writing his letter of 1143 he had come to believe that Matilda was indeed the legitimate heiress, and he supported the Angevin cause, as Matilda's claim was known.|$|E
5|$|Later studies {{investigated}} {{aspects of}} the effect. Koole, Dijksterhuis, and van Knippenberg sought to explore how automatic the preference process was. They did this with both numbers and letters. They divided participants into two groups. The first group was asked to give quick, intuitive reactions stating preferences for the stimuli. The second group was asked to reason why they liked some numbers better than others and to analyse which features of the numbers they liked. As the researchers had predicted, they found that both the birthday-number effect and name-letter effect disappeared in the ‘thinking’ condition. They argued that thinking about reasons instigates deliberative overriding of implicit self-esteem effects. This <b>conclusion</b> <b>was</b> supported by looking at correlations between the effects: whereas in the feeling condition {{the strength of a}} participant's birthday-number effect was correlated to his or her name-letter effect, no such correlation was found in the thinking condition.|$|E
