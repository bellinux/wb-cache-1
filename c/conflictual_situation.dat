There are various styles or approaches in conflict resolution training (ADR, Verbal Aikido, NVC) that can give the practitionner the means to accept the <b>conflictual</b> <b>situation</b> and orient it towards a peaceful resolution. As one peer mediation coordinator put it: “Conflict is very natural and normal, but you can’t go through your entire life beating everybody up—you have to learn different ways to resolve conflict” ...|$|E
5000|$|Traditionally the Kondh {{religious}} beliefs were syncretic combining totemism, animism, Ancestor worship, shamanism and nature worship.The Kondhs gave highest {{importance to the}} Earth goddess, who is held to be the creator and sustainer of the world. Earlier Human Sacrifices called [...] "Meriah" [...] were offered by the Kondh to propitiate the Earth Goddess. In the Kondh society, a breach of accepted religious conduct by any member of their society invited the wrath of spirits {{in the form of}} lack of rain fall, soaking of streams, destruction of forest produce, and other natural calamities. Hence, the customary laws, norms, taboos, and values were greatly adhered to and enforced with high to heavy punishments, depending upon the seriousness of the crimes committed. The practise of traditional religion has almost become extinct today. Due to increased Hindu Religious influence (Sanskritisation) the Kondh pantheon now has the common Hindu gods and their own Gods have been reduced to the status of minor deities in the Hindu Pantheon, often as a child of a Hindu deity. The Hindu influence is clearly seen in the decline in consumption of beef (earlier a common food) among the Kondhs. Many Kondhs converted to Protestant Christianity {{in the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth century due to the efforts of the missionaries of the Serampore Mission. The influence of Kondh traditional beliefs on Christianity can be seen in some rituals such as those associated with Easter and resurrection when ancestors are also venerated and given offerings, although the church officially rejects the traditional beliefs as pagan. Many Kondhs have also converted to Islam and a great diversity of religious practises can be seen among the members of the Tribe. Significantly, as with any culture, the ethical practices of the Kondh reinforce the social and economic practices that define the people. Thus, the sacredness of the earth perpetuates tribal socio-economics, wherein harmony with nature and respect for anscestors is deeply embedded whereas non tribal cultures that neglect the sacredness of the land find no problem in committing deforestation, strip-mining etc., and this has led to a <b>conflictual</b> <b>situation</b> in many instances.|$|E

Objectives: To study the influence of organizational and professional commitment of the nurses in the strategies of conflict resolution. Methods: This is a quantitative, transversal and non-experimental research, following a descriptive-correlational way. Data were obtained by applying a questionnaire to nurses that work on different types of Primary Health Care Units. As measuring instruments we used three scales that grouped a total of nine subscales used to evaluate: the organizational commitment, the professional commitment and the strategies of conflict resolution. Results: The majority of nurses present moderate scores of organizational and Professional commitment with higher affective commitment to the normative commitment or instrumental commitment and feel that nursing is an interesting and challenging profession, but personal and social perception of nursing relevance is moderately weak. Nurses adopt the domination conflict resolution strategies and accommodation over the head and less integrative strategies and commitment. With subordinates more nurses adopt the avoidance strategy. When the <b>conflictual</b> <b>situation</b> arises with colleagues more endow the integrative strategies and commitment and less domination strategy. The organizational and professional commitment is significantly associated with some solving strategies conflict adopted by nurses as the <b>conflictual</b> <b>situation</b> arises with the boss, with subordinates or colleagues. Some dimensions of organizational commitment and professional foretell to significantly shape the adoption of conflict resolution strategy adopted. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} has demonstrated that a relationship exists between perceived accent and ethnic group loyalty in a <b>conflictual</b> <b>situation</b> (i. e., when the members of an ethnic group are in conflict with members of the target language group) and that such a relationship may have behavioral consequences. The present study investigated (1) whether such a relationship exists in a situation when there is no conflict between the two language groups involved (i. e., for native Chinese speakers learning English in Montreal), (2) what the behavioral manifestations of this relationship would be, and (3) what factors influenced this relationship. Eighty-four participants from mainland China residing in Montreal listened to native Chinese reading a passage in English (spoken with various degrees of foreign accent) and Chinese in a matched-guise procedure. They then judged the speakers' accentedness, loyalty towards the Chinese, personality traits and ability to be leaders and members of two different group situations. Results revealed that a relationship between perceived accent and ethnic group loyalty indeed exists in a non-conflictual situation and that this relationship has consequences upon native Chinese listeners' choices of speakers as leaders and members of their group. These consequences are different from those observed in earlier research in a <b>conflictual</b> <b>situation.</b> Results overall highlight the importance of group factors in L 2 learning and suggest the need to consider ethnic group loyalty as a variable in both applied linguistic research and L 2 pedagogy...|$|E

Beyond demonstrating a commitment for self-improvement, individual company initiatives {{might become a}} survival strategy in developing multilevel interactions with the state.

CBMs emerged from attempts by the Cold War superpowers and their military alliances (the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the Warsaw Pact) to avoid nuclear war by accident or miscalculation. However, CBMs also exist at other levels of conflict situations, and in different regions of the world although they might not have been called CBMs.|$|R

40|$|This paper aims at {{clarifying}} the ontology of conflict as a preliminary for constructing a conflict mapping guide (Wehr 1979). After recalling the main definitions elaborated in different disciplines, {{the meaning of}} conflict is elicited through semantic analysis based on corpus evidence. Two fundamental meanings emerge: conflict as an interpersonal hostility between two or more human subjects, and conflict as a propositional incompatibility. These two states of affairs are significantly related, because the latter tends to generate the former whenever the incompatible positions are embodied by as many parties who feel personally questioned. The semantic analysis allows sketching the ontology of the <b>conflictual</b> <b>situation</b> that can serve to generate a conflict mapping guide, and facing several crucial aspects that are relevant both to the study and to the management of conflicts. In the former perspective, it allows the comparison of the situation of interpersonal conflict with the seemingly similar process of controversy...|$|E

Discursively, Casamançais speak about it similarly in both localities, construing co-residence on the neighbourhood scale as a sociality that builds on similar moral values such as relative equality, respect and consideration. At the same time, this sociality also implies negotiation, interaction and translation as central everyday practices. Investigating these practices reveals how they facilitate locally specific forms of neighbourliness.

In particular, individuals linked by a large majority of negative edges create mostly “apparent disorder,” rather than true “frustration. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{existing}} {{theoretical and empirical}} foundation for our understanding of intergovernmental implementation, drawing on works from the fields of policy implementation, intergovernmental relations, and conflict resolution and management. The argument is made that previous works {{in the field of}} policy implementation have Wed to reflect the importance of conflict as a factor influencing the implementation process, primarily because such works were largely based on grants as the primary policy instrument. One crucial distinction between grants and mdates as instruments of intergovernmental policy is that the latter typically are marked by a higher degree of conflict between the levels of government. Consequently, this study concentrates on the example of a state mandate on solid waste and how the imposition of the mandate on counties in North Carolina creates a <b>conflictual</b> <b>situation</b> for the parties responsible for its implementation. A central hypothesis of the study is that the way in which conflict is managed by the parties involved in implementation has an impact on {{the degree to which the}} policy goal...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} agency losses (agency shirking and agency slippage) {{in the process of}} power delegation in EU trade policy. The central question is whether a <b>conflictual</b> <b>situation</b> exists between the interests of the member states and those of the European Commission (agency shirking), or whether the structure of delegation in itself stimulates the agent to adopt a different position from the principals (agency slippage). Drawing on the principal-agent approach, I argue that agency losses are due to the structure of delegation and that the existence of multiple principals with diverging preferences facilitates agency. I find empirical evidence that the Council-Commission relationship on trade politics has different dynamics depending on the negotiating stage. In the initial negotiating stage, when defining the negotiating mandate of the Commission, the relationship is cooperative. Conflict between the Commission and the Council only breaks out in a latter stage of negotiations, when the Commission makes concessions at the international level.
