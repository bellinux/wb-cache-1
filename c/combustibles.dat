5|$|As {{the tunnels}} were constructed, they were {{generally}} supported by wooden beams and posts. Once the mine had been finished, the internal space {{was filled with}} <b>combustibles,</b> such as brushwood, firewood, resin, and other incendiary substances; once ignited, these would burn the supporting props, causing the mine to collapse, bringing down with it the structures lying above. From the 15th century, gunpowder was also used, although the aim remained to burn the props.|$|E
5|$|The Confederate Navy {{originally}} had devised a plan where the James River Squadron would swarm Monitor {{with a party}} of men {{with the intention of}} capturing the vessel by boarding and disabling her by using heavy hammers to drive iron wedges under and disabling the turret and by covering the pilot house with a wet sail effectively blinding the pilot.

500|$|... "Greek fire" [...] was {{the name}} given by Western Europeans to the {{flammable}} concoction used by the Byzantines, so called because the Europeans viewed the Byzantines as Greeks. The Byzantines themselves used various descriptive names for it, but the most common was [...] "liquid fire" [...] (...) [...] Although the use of incendiary chemicals by the Byzantines has been attested to since the early 6th century, the actual substance known as Greek fire {{is believed to have}} been created in 673 and is attributed to an engineer from Syria, named Kallinikos. [...] The most common method of deployment was to emit the formula through a large bronze tube (siphōn) onto enemy ships. Alternatively, it could be launched in jars fired from catapults; pivoting cranes (gerania) are also mentioned as a method of pouring <b>combustibles</b> onto enemy ships. Usually the mixture would be stored in heated, pressurized barrels and projected through the tube by some sort of pump while the operators were sheltered behind large iron shields. A portable version (cheirosiphōn) also existed, reputedly invented by Leo VI, making it the direct analogue to a modern flamethrower. The means of its production was kept a state secret, and its components are only roughly guessed or described through secondary sources like Anna Komnene, so that its exact composition remains to this day unknown. In its effect, the Greek fire must have been rather similar to napalm. Contemporary sources make clear that it could not be extinguished by water, but rather floated and burned on top of it; sand could extinguish it by depriving it of oxygen, and several authors also mention strong vinegar and old urine as being able to extinguish it, presumably by some sort of chemical reaction. Consequently, felt or hides soaked in vinegar were used to provide protection against it.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the causal relationship between economic growth, <b>combustible</b> renewables and waste consumption, and CO 2 emissions {{for a balanced}} panel of five North Africa countries during the period 1971 - 2008. The panel cointegration test results indicate that in the short-run there is a unidirectional causality running from real GDP per capita to per capita CO 2 emissions. However, {{there is evidence of}} no causality between <b>combustible</b> renewables and waste consumption and real GDP and between <b>combustible</b> renewables and waste consumption and CO 2 emissions. In the long-run, we find that there is evidence of a unidirectional causality running from CO 2 emissions and <b>combustible</b> renewables and waste consumption to real GDP. The results from panel FMOLS and DOLS estimates show that emissions is the most significant variable in explaining economic growth in the region which is followed by the consumption of <b>combustible</b> renewables and waste. In the long-run, increases in <b>combustible</b> renewables and waste consumption and emissions lead to increase economic growth. The finding of this paper is that North Africa region can use <b>combustible</b> renewables and waste as a substitutable energy to the fossil one and avoid the disaster on atmosphere by reducing emissions without impeding economic growth in the long-run. ...|$|R
