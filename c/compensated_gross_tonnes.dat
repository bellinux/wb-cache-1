500|$|In 1907 {{the first}} ferry, an unmotorized barge named Tinnsjø was completed; the steam ship Skarsfos {{was used to}} haul it between the two railways. The first {{self-propelled}} ferry was SF Rjukanfos, a 338 <b>gross</b> <b>tonne</b> ferry launched in 1909. She got a major overhaul in 1915 after the sister ship SF Hydro at 494 <b>gross</b> <b>tonnes</b> was launched the same year.

2500|$|Norsk Transport {{had four}} ferries that transported the wagons [...] down Lake Tinn from Mæl to Tinnoset. From 1907 an unmotorized barge named Tinnsjø was completed; the steam ship Skarsfos {{was used to}} haul it between the two railways.

50|$|Two inland canals {{connect the}} sea and Port of Varna East with Lake Varna, Lake Beloslav and Port of Varna West: Channel 1 with draft 11.5 m and Channel 2 with draft 11.0 m. The canals form an island, on which a {{deepwater}} oil terminal, among other port facilities, is currently located. The depths of the ship berths and the approaches allow the handling of vessels of capacity up to 50,000 <b>gross</b> <b>tonnes.</b> In view of the stated safe canal depths, only vessels of draft less than 9.9 m and airdraft up to 46 m are allowed to Varna West. Vessels with load over 200 m, beam over 26 m, or over 20,000 <b>gross</b> <b>tonnes</b> are required to pass the channels during daylight hours only.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} heavy haul train {{experiences}} of two large coal haulage operators: COALlink, Spoornet, South Africa and QR, Australia. Both rail systems have developed different train designs {{to meet their}} specific haulage needs. The reasons for these differences are examined {{using a combination of}} simulated and measured data. The first part of the investigation is focused on existing train systems. The trains compared are the head end powered COALlink train of 21, 500 <b>gross</b> <b>tonnes</b> and the distributed power Coal and Mainline Freigt train of 7900 <b>gross</b> <b>tonnes.</b> The advantaes of distributed power are explored for the 21, 500 tonne COALlink train using the configuration of two equal wagon rates. The paper also explores by simulation the scope for each system to operate even larger trains, COALlink extending to 32, 300 <b>gross</b> <b>tonnes</b> and Coal and Mainline Freight to 18, 500 tonnes. To enable some method of normalised comparison using simulation the experimental technique of applying the same set of driving rules to each simulation was used. This allowed simulations to be completed over the full length of the haulage system. This technique imediately highlights the differences and similarities of the two systems. The simulation results confirmed the need for higher power-mass rations in QR trains and illustrate the in-train force reduction benefits of distributed power...|$|R
