40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} the prophetic chronotope as a form of alternate, circular time in Baron Ludwig von Reizenstein’s gothic romance, The Mysteries of New Orleans. As the novel’s temporal structure seemingly contains the professed slave revolution through a manipulation of a linear prophetic sequence into circular time, Reizenstein simultaneously portrays a sexual revolution within the <b>closed</b> <b>temporal</b> system; however, as he localizes the sexual revolution in the “real time” of the reader through the inclusion of extra-textual artifacts, the novel’s closed system of alternate, circular time sustains a fissure, loosing all revolutionary potential, slave and sexual, into the reader’s temporality. Reizenstein compares sexual slavery, social restrictions on sexual expression, to chattel slavery, but recognizes it as endemic form of bondage affecting every race; therefore, Reizenstein uses chattel slavery as a ubiquitous circumstance in the U. S. South to identify other covert forms of slavery. In the end, the slave and sexual revolutions become the same conflict, and the restoration of beauty becomes its primary aim...|$|R

30|$|Second, S 1 (10) {{is close}} {{to the center of the}} only static {{community}} present in [2010 – 2011] and it is connected to the two most important vertices in the network. The existence of a single dense community, and the proximity to two most productive vertices can explain its negligible static centrality value: while still connecting various vertices S 1 (10) is not the shortest connector, and its betweenness value is thus low. However, a <b>closer</b> <b>temporal</b> look reveals that it plays an important role as an interaction bridge between all the actors that appear in 2010 and later, and the ones that appear earlier than 2010. This role remained invisible in static analysis and only emerges when we pay attention to the time of appearance of vertices and edges. On the basis of these observations, we can interpret S 1 (10)’s high temporal betweenness value as providing a fast bridge from vertices created earlier and those appearing later in time. This might indicate reasons for further study of the importance of poster presentations that can blend tacit and explicit knowledge mobilization in human–poster presentation–human relations during conferences, and continue into future mobilization with new non-human actors as was the case for S 1 (10).|$|R
40|$|When period {{instruments}} first appeared, audiences {{were highly}} skeptical of their musical value. It {{was not until}} the early- 1900 s—and performers like Arnold Dolmetsch—that they began to become not only accepted, but increasingly mandated for early music performances. However, while criticisms regarding their use persisted into the 1940 s, it has never received the type of intense debate other details of performance practice have. Perhaps because of this lack, scholarship has also neglected to consider what ideological roles period instruments have played in historical performance. Why does the role of period instruments matter?  Partly because most writing about early music includes assumptions about them and their importance; for instance, mid- 20 th century performance practice guides implicitly assign them considerable authority over the ever-contested designation of “authenticity. ” However, this is not the only role period instruments play. I argue that early advocates for period instruments like Arnold Dolmetsch used them to create a type of “intimacy” crucial to many aspects of performance practice.

40|$|Abstract The {{presence}} of a solar burst spectral component with flux density increasing with frequency in the sub-terahertz range, spectrally separated from the well-known microwave spectral component, bring new possibilities to explore the flaring physical processes, both observational and theoretical. The solar event of 6 December 2006, starting at about 18 : 30 UT, exhibited a particularly welldefined double spectral structure, with the sub-THz spectral component detected at 212 and 405 GHz by SST and microwaves (1 - 18 GHz) observed by the Owens Valley Solar Array (OVSA). Emissions obtained by instruments in satellites are discussed with emphasis to ultra-violet (UV) obtained by the Transition Region And Coronal Explorer (TRACE), soft X-rays from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) and X- and γ-rays from the Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI). The sub-THz impulsive component had its <b>closer</b> <b>temporal</b> counterpart only in the higher energy X-and γ-rays ranges. The spatial positions of the centers of emission at 212 GHz for the first flux enhancement were clearly displaced {{by more than one}} arcminute from positions at the following phases. The observed sub-THz fluxes and burst source plasma parameters were found difficult to be reconciled to a purely thermal emission component. We discuss possible mechanisms to explain the double spectral components at microwaves and in the THz ranges. 1 Centro de Rádio-Astronomia e Astrofísica Mackenzie, Escola de Engenharia, Universidade Presbiterian...|$|R

50|$|In the 2007 book The Ethics of Care and Empathy, philosopher Michael Slote {{introduces}} {{a theory of}} care-based ethics that is grounded in empathy.

These natural obligations include a greater empathic, and moral obligation to family and friends, along with an account of temporal and physical distance. In situations of <b>close</b> <b>temporal</b> and physical distance, and with family or friends, our moral obligation seems stronger to us than with strangers at a distance naturally.

50|$|Another {{important}} {{application of}} {{social learning theory}} {{has been in the}} treatment and conceptualization of anxiety disorders. The classical conditioning approach to anxiety disorders, which spurred the development of behavioral therapy and is considered by some to be the first modern theory of anxiety, began to lose steam in the late 1970s as researchers began to question its underlying assumptions. For example, the classical conditioning approach holds that pathological fear and anxiety are developed through direct learning; however, many people with anxiety disorders cannot recall a traumatic conditioning event, in which the feared stimulus was experienced in <b>close</b> <b>temporal</b> and spatial contiguity with an intrinsically aversive stimulus.Social learning theory helped salvage learning approaches to anxiety disorders by providing additional mechanisms beyond classical conditioning that could account for the acquisition of fear. For example, social learning theory suggests that a child could acquire a fear of snakes by observing a family member express fear in response to snakes. Alternatively, the child could learn the associations between snakes and unpleasant bites through direct experience, without developing excessive fear, but could later learn from others that snakes can have deadly venom, leading to a re-evaluation of the dangerousness of snake bites, and accordingly, a more exaggerated fear response to snakes.|$|E
50|$|The dating of Naxos {{is intimately}} {{connected}} {{with two other}} events in the Greek world which occurred at the same time. Thucydides claims that Pausanias, having been stripped of his command after the Siege of Byzantium, returned to Byzantium as a private citizen soon after and took command of the city until he was expelled by the Athenians. He then crossed the Bosporus and settled in Colonae in the Troad, until {{he was accused of}} collaborating with the Persians and was recalled by the Spartans for trial (after which he starved himself to death). Thucydides again provides no chronology of these events. Shortly afterwards, the Spartans accused the Athenian statesman Themistocles, then in exile in Argos, of complicity in Pausanias's treason. As a result, Themistocles fled from Argos, eventually to Asia Minor. Thucydides states that on his journey, Themistocles inadvertently ended up at Naxos, at that time being besieged by Athenians. The three events, Pausanias's treason, Themistocles's flight and the Siege of Naxos therefore occurred in <b>close</b> <b>temporal</b> sequence. These events certainly happened after 474 BC (the earliest possible date for Themistocles's ostracism), and have generally been placed in around 470/469 BC. However, there are several incongruities in the story of Themistocles if this date is accepted. A much later date for Pausanias's expulsion from Byzantium has been proposed, and if accepted, this pushes these three events into c. 467 BC, which resolves the problems regarding Themistocles, and also probably explains some incidental details mentioned in Plutarch's biography of Cimon. However, this modified timeline is not universally accepted by historians.|$|E
30|$|Another {{limitation}} arises due to {{the capacity}} of process modeling software to handle all production sectors, and hence, relevant modeling software {{will need to be}} selected. Aspen Plus used in this work [or other open source software like COCO simulator (COCO 2018)] can be used for most of the chemical sectors including refining, biomass and waste processing, mechanical production can be modeled using assembly line simulation packages, service sectors will need original model development relevant to the economy (following causal or correlation between inputs and outputs), farming sectors can use the software/models from agricultural modeling community [such as EPIC (Texas A&M AgriLife Research 2017)]. Using process modeling software like Aspen will need improvement for handling complex mixtures and solids. Aspen is strong on handling recycle flows and sensitivity analysis to help ensure that product splits and supplemental feeds are present in correct quantities. Still, this method does not depend on a specific software, and other simulation software for specific sectors can be used as long as production recipes and mass balanced products and residuals are provided at a sectoral level. The modeling approach can be adapted to different regions and countries, but the models themselves may need to be adjusted based on regional practices. Finally, in our first ever demonstration of the process engineering models to PIOT approach we have assumed <b>closed</b> <b>temporal</b> boundaries, with no movement in and out of inventories. This can be overcome by integration with dynamic models for capital (Pauliuk et al. 2015 b), which should be supplemented with economic models.|$|R

One-third of patients who are hospitalized for acute decompensation present with ACLF at admission or develop the syndrome during hospitalization. ACLF frequently occurs in a <b>closed</b> <b>temporal</b> relationship to a precipitating event, such as bacterial infection or acute alcoholic, drug-induced or viral hepatitis. However, no precipitating event can be identified in approximately 40 % of patients. The mechanisms of ACLF involve systemic inflammation due to infections, acute liver damage and, in cases without precipitating events, probably intestinal translocation of bacteria or bacterial products. ACLF is graded into three stages (ACLF grades 1 - 3) {{on the basis of}} the number of organ failures, with higher grades associated with increased mortality. Liver and renal failures are the most common organ failures, followed by coagulation, brain, circulatory and respiratory failure. The 28 -day mortality rate associated with ACLF is 30 %.
