50|$|It is {{very much}} in the {{interest}} of the network operator to use the allocated spectrum as efficiently as possible and to the highest possible capacity because most of the investment is done to get the licence for it. It would be desirable to have the frequency reuse of one, which means that each cell can operate in the same frequency. This in turn creates interference to the users operating in nearby places. Increase Interference causes voice quality to drop and may cause <b>call</b> <b>drop.</b> It is now a well known fact that it is possible to cancel the interference at the mobile handset side by changing the baseband software without changing anything in the network side. SAIC-enabled mobiles can work in high interference levels. SAIC-enabled mobiles need even less transmit power from the network which in turn reduces the interference in the network. Studies shows that the speech quality gain can be about 6% at a SAIC mobiles penetration of 10%, about 37% at a SAIC mobiles penetration of 50%, about 99% at a SAIC mobiles penetration of 100%.|$|E

Over the years, many strategies have been proposed to solve the problem of <b>call</b> <b>drop</b> out, but it is still prevalent.

40|$|Abstract. Femtocell is an {{emerging}} technology for expanding cell coverage and increasing data rate, and its users deploy {{in their own}} premises by themselves. Therefore, femto base stations cannot go through manual cell planning procedure as the mobile communication base stations do. Femto base station sets its parameters, such as transmit power or pilot power, considering the surrounding radio environment. Due to its automated cell planning and parameter setting, leakage of the power {{to the outside of}} a house can occur and lead to highly increased number of unwanted handover events of macrocell users, which will finally lead to higher <b>call</b> <b>drop</b> probability.

40|$|Abstract. In multi {{access network}} environments, mobile {{stations}} may encounter multiple choices for selecting an access network. Carefully designed access selection schemes can provide not only mobile users with better services but also network operators with better resource utilizations. It is also envisioned that further improvements {{can be achieved}} by redistributing mobile stations from one access network to anther (i. e., vertical handovers). Such decisions should be made by following carefully designed, yet simple to implement, protocols. In this paper, we present a cost-based scheme for access selection and vertical handover decision algorithms. The proposed algorithm was implemented in a Java-based simulator called MANSim (Multiple Access Network Simulator) that we developed.

All the available models predict TCP performance for a single link. Furthermore, all models relate timeouts to packet drops either due to congestion or due to transmission errors.
