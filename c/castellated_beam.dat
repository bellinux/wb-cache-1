40|$|Nowadays, <b>castellated</b> <b>beam</b> becomes {{popular in}} {{building}} structural as beam members. This {{is due to}} several advantages of <b>castellated</b> <b>beam</b> such as increased depth without any additional mass, passing the underfloor service ducts without changing of story elevation. However, the presence of holes can develop various local effects such as local buckling, lateral torsional buckling caused by compression force at the flange section of the steel beam. Many studies have investigated the failure mechanism of <b>castellated</b> <b>beam</b> and one technique which can prevent the beam fall into local failure {{is the use of}} reinforced concrete slab as lateral support on <b>castellated</b> <b>beam,</b> so called composite <b>castellated</b> <b>beam.</b> Besides of preventing the local failure of <b>castellated</b> <b>beam,</b> the concrete slab can increase the plasticity moment of the composite <b>castellated</b> <b>beam</b> section which can deliver into increasing the ultimate load of the beam. The aim of this numerical studies of composite <b>castellated</b> <b>beam</b> on certain loading condition (monotonic quasi-static loading). ABAQUS was used for finite element modelling purpose and compared with the experimental test for checking the reliability of the model.

40|$|In Diploma {{demonstration}} of bending and shear resistance of steel beams with openings in web and for <b>castellated</b> <b>beams</b> is being presented. Dimensioning of such beams is performed {{in compliance with}} general rules by Eurocode for dimensioning of beams by considering speciality of beams with openings or by non-linear analysis with consideration of imperfections. For delimit of beams with openings from <b>castellated</b> <b>beams,</b> geometric criteria are being used. Further approach to the dimensioning of {{these two types of}} beams depends on mentioned geometric delimitations. Resistance to lateral torsional buckling, for <b>castellated</b> <b>beams</b> and beams with openings, is demonstrated {{in the same way as}} solid web beams, by taking geometric and static characteristics of the cross-sectional area at the place opening into account. It is possible to more accurately determine the behaviour of beams with openings by using advanced computer software than by already established methods by Eurocodes.

40|$|While {{the study}} of non-composite <b>castellated</b> <b>beams</b> have {{received}} much attention, very little {{work has been done}} on composite <b>castellated</b> <b>beams.</b> The effect of the composite concrete slab is to significantly increase the flexural resistance of a steel section; it is however uncertain what effect this will have on the shear resistance. In this research project tests to destruction of five composite <b>castellated</b> <b>beams</b> were performed, and relate to previous tests on non-composite <b>castellated</b> <b>beams.</b> Ultimate failure loads of the three shear critical test beams were associated with web-post buckling, comprising double curvature bending. The remaining two flexural test beams failed when most of the studs in one-half of the span failed, resulting in lateral torsional buckling of the suddenly unconstrained flange. A numerical study using the finite element method was then employed in investigating the nonlinear buckling behavior of the web-posts in shear critical composite and non-composite <b>castellated</b> <b>beams.</b> Buckling of the web-posts was observed to be the dominant mode of failure in all finite element models; the composite beams were found to have significantly higher ultimate shear carrying capacities than their non-composite counterparts. It was found that the effect of the composite slab is to reduce the shear force in the web-posts, thus increasing the beam ultimate shear carrying capacity. Finally, yield analyses were performed on <b>castellated</b> <b>beams</b> using moment-to-shear interaction diagrams originally developed for isolated web openings. Results based on yield failures were found to be in good agreement with the test failure loads for the flexure critical beams. Yield analysis tended to slightly overestimate the failure loads for the shear critical composite test beams, due largely to the buckling failures of the web-posts in the tests.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} reduced {{beam section}} (RBS) technique on <b>castellated</b> <b>beam.</b> Aim {{of this study}} is to ensure the plastic moment reach far from column face without significant of strength decreasing. Four models of <b>castellated</b> <b>beam</b> with various types of RBS and one model without RBS have been considered. ABAQUS FEA software package was used for modelling purpose. Loading condition, i. e. lateral load as representing earthquake load, was monotonic load using displacement control at the top of the column.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} use of {{artificial}} neural networks in predicting the failure load of <b>castellated</b> <b>beams.</b> 47 experimental data collected from the literature cover the simply supported beams with various modes of failure, under the action of either central single load, uniformly distributed load or two-point loads acting symmetrically {{with respect to the}} center line of the span. The data are arranged in a format such that 8 input parameters cover the geometrical and loading properties of <b>castellated</b> <b>beams</b> and the corresponding output is the ultimate failure load. A back-propagation artificial neural network is developed using Neuro-shell predictor software, and used to predict the ultimate load capacity of <b>castellated</b> <b>beams.</b> The main benefit in using neural network approach is that the network is built directly from the experimental or theoretical data using the self-organizing capabilities of the neural network. Results are compared with available methods in the literature such the Blodgett’s Method and the BS Code. It is found that the average ratio of actual to predicted failure loads of castellated was 0. 99 for neural network, 2. 2 for Blodgett’s Method, and 1. 33 for BS Code.

The force {{behavior}} of outer annular-stiffener type steel <b>castellated</b> <b>beam</b> (OATSCB) -concrete filled steel tube (CFST) is analyzed, and {{the feasibility of}} this kind of join is discussed. The loading process of the joint is simulated by using finite element software. By analyzing the hysteretic loops, skeleton curves, energy dissipation coefficient, equivalent viscous damping coefficient and ductility coefficient, the bearing capacity and seismic performance of this type of joint is studied. Before simulation, the validity of the simulation method is verified by using the previous experiment data of outer annular-stiffener type steel beam (OATSB) - CFST. It shows that the results from the finite element simulation method and the experiment are similar to each other, and the hysteretic loops is plump, the energy dissipation coefficient, equivalent viscous damping coefficient and ductility coefficient of this type of joint are high.

40|$|Abstract. “Castellated beam ” {{is a name}} {{commonly}} used for type of expanded beam. Castellated beams combine beauty, versatility, economy in steel design. These are fabricated from standard rolled section and are engineered to save time of construction, enabling saving in steel and reducing building costs. These are mainly designed to reduce weight {{and at the same}} time increase the efficiency in structural performance. The principal advantage of castellation is the increase in vertical bending stiffness castellated beams have proved to be efficient for moderately loaded longer spans where the Design is controlled by moment capacity or deflection. In this paper a steel beam is selected and Finite Element Analysis is done for constant loading and support condition by using ANSYS software.

40|$|The {{existing}} design expressions for the {{lateral-torsional buckling}} behavior of <b>castellated</b> <b>beams</b> conflict. Furthermore, {{they do not}} take into account the detrimental effect of the residual stress modification attributable to the fabrication process, which was only recently demonstrated by the authors. This makes these design rules possibly unsafe. In this paper, the lateral-torsional buckling behavior of doubly symmetric <b>castellated</b> <b>beams</b> loaded by a constant bending moment is investigated numerically. The numerical model, including the modified residual stresses, was validated by comparing its results with experimental results. A preliminary design approach is proposed based on the current European guidelines for the calculation of the lateral-torsional buckling resistance of I-section beams. According to the proposed approach, the lateral-torsional buckling resistance of <b>castellated</b> <b>beams</b> can be determined using the cross-sectional properties calculated at the center of the web opening. The modification of the residual stresses during the fabrication process results in resistances that lie approximately one buckling curve lower.

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the dynamic properties of castellated beams, the excitation intensity of dynamic mode shapes for different loading patterns must be considered. Obviously, under a specific loading pattern, all of dynamic mode shapes are not excited. In other words, {{the response of the}} structure is dependent on the exerted loading. In this article, the powerful FEM software, ANSYS is used for investigation of dynamic properties of castellated beams. At first, a modal analysis is performed on both plain-webbed and castellated cantilever beams with two different types of lateral bracing and their dynamic properties and mode shapes are studied. This analysis shows that the presence of large web openings may have a severe penalty on the load carrying capacities of castellated beams under the dynamic gravitational loads. Then a white noise dynamic load with an appropriate frequency range is exerted on both plainwebbed and castellated beams and their various dynamic responses are studied. It can be seen that the loading pattern is a very important factor for investigation of dynamic properties of cantilever castellated beams.

Both elastic and plastic methods of analysis are utilized to predict the failure modes of these beams. Interaction diagrams predicting formation of plastic mechanisms, yielding of the horizontal weld length and elastic buckling analysis using the finite element method are correlated {{with a number of}} experimental test results from previous studies given in the literature. Test-to-predicted ratios for a total of 42 test beams ranging from 45 ° to 60 ° openings are computed with the plastic and elastic methods of analysis, and a mean of 1. 086 and coefficient of variation of 0. 195 are obtained. A parameter study covering a wide range of 60 ° <b>castellated</b> <b>beam</b> geometries is performed to derive elastic buckling coefficients under pure shear and bending forces. An elastic buckling interaction diagram is then defined, which along with the diagrams utilized in the plastic analysis, can be used to predict the elastic buckling and plastic failure loads under any given moment-to-shear ratio. To incorporate the effect of plasticity associated with buckling, expressions are derived to improve the previous theoretical models used, by combining both elastic and plastic results.

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{research}} carried out {{on the subject of}} castellated beams revealed that one subject had remained largely untouched — lateral stability. This was {{despite the fact that the}} fabrication process had increased their strength and rigidity about the, plane of loading at the expense of lateral stiffness. This emphasis on in—plane behaviour stemmed from the need to catalogue the failure modes particular to castellated beams. However because of the high number of parameters necessary to describe a <b>castellated</b> <b>beam</b> and their high degree of internal redundancy, little that can be regarded as firm design recommendations and no provisions against lateral buckling have been included in national codes of practice, particularly in the present British codes. This is why the draft of the new British code for structural steelwork 8 / 20 to be published as BS 5950 suggests the use of the simple Vierendeel analogy for in—plane behaviour and has adopted the conservative approach of 0 [...] 11. 3. 2 to the prevention of lateral buckling in which the contribution of the web and tension flange are ignored. The work undertaken herein had the aim of mainly providing the missing quantitative data on the lateral —torsional buckling strength of castellated sections currently available in the U. K. Eight full size castellated beams were tested. The results of these plus the few cases reported in the literature were used as a basis for a critical evaluation of several design approaches. Comparisons between the test results and the strength predicted by B/ 20 were found to be generally acceptable provided cross— sectional properties at a castellation were used in the calculations. Similar results were obtained for the two — stage procedure of BS 449 and BS 153 whereas the use of Table 3 in the former was shown to lead to rather low load factors. A preliminary test programme on small scale beams showed the negligible effect that the holes had on lateral buckling behaviour.

Aiming {{to reduce the}} stress level by means of rounding corner openings brings to introduction of beams with sinusoidal perforation (BSP). However, the studies of stress level in such beams depending on perforation parameters are not known. Development of empirical relation for estimation of stress level in <b>castellated</b> <b>beams</b> with sinusoidal perforation was fulfilled {{on the base of}} analysis of the results of BSP calculation by the finite element method. Results of study have allowed to establish the empirical relation for estimation of distribution regularities of equivalent stresses on Mises in <b>castellated</b> <b>beams</b> with sinusoidal perforation useful for engineering calculations. The established relation differentiates the role of every force factor: transverse force V and constant bending moment M. Calculation of hinged beams are performed under action of one pointed load applied in the mid-span and also under simple bending. The developed relation allows to determine the level of stress build-up in perforated double-tee beams with sinusoidal openings under constant transverse force V and constant bending moment M. Application of established relation to calculation of stresses in beams with the same perforation pattern was verified when varying the height of openings. The value of rounding corner radius remained unchanged. FEM calculations have shown that under constant transverse force and lineally changing bending moment, the maximum values of equivalent stresses on Mises near the contour of openings along the beam length are also changing lineally. The obtained empirical relation, in spite of its simplicity, allows to estimate the level and stress buildup in the openings zone under constant transverse force and simple bending depending on parameters of beam perforation...|$|R

A similar design is applied in the fabrication of perforated (i. e. cellular and <b>castellated)</b> <b>beams</b> mostly used to support the service integration, {{as well as the}} significant mass reduction in steel frames. This paper presents a comprehensive finite element (FE) analysis of extended end-plate beam-to-column connections, with both single and multiple circular web openings introduced {{along the length of the}} beam while subjected to the cyclic loading proposed by the SAC protocol from FEMA 350 (2000). The three-dimensional (3 D) FE solid model was validated against FE and experimental results and the chosen configuration was capable of representing the structural behaviour of a partially restrained connection, without the necessity to be idealised as fully fixed. The study focuses in the interaction of such connections and the mobilisation of stresses from the column to the perforated beam. The parameters introduced were the distance from the face of the column, S, and the web opening spacing, So, with closely and widely spaced web openings. It is found that RWS connections with cellular beams behave in a satisfactory manner and provide enhanced performance in terms of the stress distribution when subjected to cyclic loading.

40|$|In recent years, {{researchers}} study alternative connection {{designs for}} steel seismic-resistant frames {{by reducing the}} beam section in different ways including that of creating an opening in its web (RWS connections). A similar design is applied in the fabrication of perforated (i. e. cellular and <b>castellated)</b> <b>beams</b> mostly used to support the service integration, {{as well as the}} significant mass reduction in steel frames. This paper presents a comprehensive finite element (FE) analysis of extended end-plate beam-to-column connections, with both single and multiple circular web openings introduced {{along the length of the}} beam while subjected to the cyclic loading proposed by the SAC protocol from FEMA- 350 (2000). The three-dimensional (3 D) FE solid model was validated against FE and experimental results and the chosen configuration was capable of representing the structural behaviour of a partially restrained connection, without the necessity to be idealised as fully fixed. The study focuses in the interaction of such connections and the mobilisation of stresses from the column to the perforated beam. The parameters introduced were the distance from the face of the column, S, and the web opening spacing, So, with closely and widely spaced web openings. It is found that RWS connections with cellular beams behave in a satisfactory manner and provide enhanced performance in terms of the stress distribution when subjected to cyclic loading. The design of partially restrained RWS connections should be primarily based on the distance of the first opening from the face of the column...|$|R

The test structure was intended to represent one floor of an office building 12 m × 18 m in plan with a height of 4 m. Wooden cribs totalling 35.5 kg/m 2 {{were used for the}} fire load and plastic bags filled by ‘road-metal’ were used to apply gravity loads representing a typical office occupancy.|$|R

Four-storey building has total lenght of 88 m, width 48 m and its base structural grid is 8 x 8 m. The total height of building is 25, 4 m. First three floors above ground are designed with structural height of 5, 6 m whilst the 4 TH floor uses height of 4, 0 m. Frame structure is formed by primary <b>beams</b> and <b>castellated</b> secondary <b>beams.</b> Above 4 TH floor, the roof structure is designed in two alternative versions, both using solid purlins and truss girder. The 3 D computer animation of the building {{is also part of}} thesis. The shopping centre that is subject of the final thesis is located in Brno area...|$|R
50|$|The {{suspension}} {{bridge over the}} River Ure at Middleham is subject to a height restriction of 13 foot (4 metre) with poor advanced signage. The road over the bridge is only able to sustain one way traffic, with the priority given to vehicles exiting Middleham (i.e. going north to Leyburn). The bridge is <b>castellated</b> with stone <b>beams</b> going widthways across the structure. This accounts for the height restriction as the bridge goes over the river and not under a railway or canal.|$|R
30|$|Yang et al. (2015 a, b) {{introduced}} {{a new kind of}} partially precast or prefabricated, <b>castellated,</b> steel-reinforced, concrete <b>beam,</b> which is abbreviated here as CPSRC beam. This kind of CPSRC beam is composed of a precast outer part and a cast-in-place inner part. The precast outer part is composed of an encased, castellated steel shape, reinforcement bars and high-performance concrete. Simplified formulas were proposed by Yang et al. (2015 a, b) to calculate the prestress and the ultimate capacities of the strengthened beams. The accuracy of the formulas was verified by the experimental results.|$|R
40|$|Through beams {{are widely}} used in the {{construction}} of large-span civil and industrial buildings, bridge engineering and mechanical engineering. They include open-frame girders and <b>castellated</b> <b>beams.</b> In order to determine their stress-strain state, software systems based on the finite element method are used or approximate calculations using simplified calculation patterns of Virendel beams are performed. Recently, many projects have been completed, in which A. R. Rzhanitsyn’s theory of compound rods is applied to calculate through structures. In this model, discrete links connecting upper and lower belts of the structure are re-placed by cross ties and shift connections continuously distributed {{along the length of the}} joint. Cross links hinder the convergence or separation of belts from one another. As a rule, pliability of cross links is neglected. This assumption, which substantially facilitates the calculation, is consistent with the hypothesis that there is no lateral strain in individual rods, calculated according to the theory. Therefore, whenever a compound rod is loaded, all its layers, and in this case – belts, are deformed according to the same curve pattern. In calculations, elastically compliant shift connections are replaced by the required distribution function of shear forces distributed along the length of the beam joint. Thus, the calculation of a through-beam is reduced to the solution of three ordinary differential equations of the second order, on the basis of which the following functions should be defined: beam deflection, bending moment and shear stress in the beam joint. The author discusses development of a numerical method of calculation of through beams based on the A. R. Rzhanitsyn’s theory of compound rods. To solve the system of differential equations, difference equations of the successive approximations method are involved to take account of finite discontinuities of the desired function, its first derivative and the right-hand side of the original differential equation. They demonstrate high accuracy if compared to well-known finite difference method equations. To illustrate the algorithm, the author provides sample calculations of open-frame girders and perforated beams having openings of different shapes. The results obtained by the authors are compared with a well-known analytical solution and a numerical solution based on the finite element method.
