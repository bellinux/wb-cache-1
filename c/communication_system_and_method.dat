40|$|Disclosed is a noise <b>{{communication}}</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> <b>method.</b> The {{noise communication}} system comprises a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter indexes {{through at least}} two noise records which comprise a series of randomly generated samples, the noise records being divided into noise segments, to maintain a current noise segment for each noise record. The transmitter modulates a predefined base signal using the segments of the noise records to represent the symbols of the base signal. In modulating the predefined base signal, the transmitter replaces the respective symbols of the base signal with the current noise segments from the noise records, thereby generating a noise signal in which the symbols can not be discerned. The noise signal is transmitted across a communications channel to the receiver which demodulates the noise signal into the base signal. The demodulation employs a number of correlators that equals the number of noise records employed at the transmitter. The receiver includes logic to index through the noise records {{in a similar manner}} to the transmitter to produce the current noise segments. Each correlator performs a multiplication function between a current noise segment from the noise record assigned to the correlator and the received segments of the noise signal which reveals a peak output when the segments match. The base signal is recreated by incorporating the symbol indicated by the noise record for which a match was experienced. Georgia Tech Research Corporatio...|$|E

The work {{presented in the}} thesis {{can be divided into}} three main areas; error probability bounds for convolutional codes, analysis of multilevel modulation, and investigation of low-density parity-check convolutional codes. New bounds are developed for the bit and burst error probabilities of convolutional codes that are used for transmission over a binary symmetric channel or an additive white Gaussian noise channel. The new bounds for the burst error probability are significantly tighter than prevalent bounds. Coded modulation is a technique that can be used when constructing bandwidth efficient systems. One form of coded modulation is multilevel modulation, which offers the opportunity to use a suboptimal multistage decoder. This decoder is less complex than the corresponding maximum likelihood decoder is. In this work, multilevel modulation undergoes an asymptotical ensemble analysis in terms of error exponents, and a comparison to the corresponding conventional coded modulation system. Furthermore, the Chernoff bounding parameter is calculated for a number of signal constellations {{that can be used in}} multilevel modulation systems. These calculations are done under the assumption that a suboptimal metric, the nearest neighbor metric, is employed in the multistage decoder. For each of these signal constellations, the effective capacity and cutoff rate are also given. Low-density parity-check codes combined with iterative decoding have proved to have the potential to achieve low bit error rates even when operating close to the channel capacity. In this treatise, low-density parity-check convolutional (LDPCC) codes are defined, <b>and</b> different construction <b>methods</b> are presented. A statistical ensemble analysis of LDPCC codes is performed, and it results in bounds on the free distance and on the error probability.

However, many vehicular applications rely on continuous and detailed location information of the vehicles, which {{has the potential to}} infringe the users’ location privacy. A multitude of privacy-protection mechanisms have been proposed in recent years. However, few efforts have been made to develop privacy metrics that can provide a quantitative way to assess the privacy risk, evaluate the effectiveness of a given privacy-enhanced design, and explore the full possibilities of protection methods. In this paper, we present a location privacy metric for measuring location privacy in vehicular <b>communication</b> <b>systems.</b> As computers do not forget and most drivers of motor vehicles follow certain daily driving patterns, if a user’s location information is gathered and stored over a period of time, e. g., weeks or months, such cumulative information might be exploited by an adversary performing a location privacy attack to gain useful information on the user’s whereabouts. Thus to precisely reflect the underlying privacy values, in our approach we take into account the accumulated information. Specifically, we develop <b>methods</b> <b>and</b> algorithms to process, propagate, and reflect the accumulated information in the privacy measurements.

In this paper, we study the impact of reconfigurable antenna arrays on maximizing the capacity of {{multiple input multiple output}} (MIMO) wireless communication links in sparse multipath environments. There is growing experimental evidence that physical wireless channels exhibit a sparse multipath structure, even at relatively low antenna dimensions. We propose a model for sparse multipath channels and show that sparse channels afford a new dimension over which capacity can be optimized: the distribution or configuration of the sparse statistically independent degrees of freedom (DoF) in the available spatial signal space dimensions. Our results show that the configuration of the sparse DoF has a profound impact on capacity and also characterize the optimal capacity-maximizing channel configuration at any operating SNR. We then develop a framework for realizing the optimal channel configuration at any SNR by systematically adapting the antenna spacings at the transmitter and the receiver to the level of sparsity in the physical multipath environment. Surprisingly, three canonical array configurations are sufficient for near-optimum performance over the entire SNR range. In a sparse scattering environment with randomly distributed paths, the capacity gain due to the optimal configuration is directly proportional to the number of antennas. Numerical results based on a realistic physical model are presented to illustrate the implications of our framework.

40|$|Blind source {{separation}} (BSS) is {{a process}} to recover a set of unobserved source signals from their linear mixtures with unknown coefficients. Very little {{is assumed to be}} known about the sources, except that they are mutually independent and that at most one of them is Gaussian. The underlying principle in BSS is independent component analysis. In this dissertation, we explore a new application of BSS for digital <b>communication</b> <b>systems,</b> <b>and</b> new robust <b>methods</b> for BSS. ^ In a digital <b>communication</b> <b>system,</b> digital information is transmitted to the receiver through a communication channel. In many applications, multiple-access protocols are used to provide a channel for multiple users, such as in Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA). The performance of the <b>communication</b> <b>system</b> can be greatly limited by various impairments which include additive noise, intersymbol interference (ISI), and adjacent channel interference (ACI). We show that FDMA <b>systems</b> with ACI <b>and</b> ISI can be modeled as a BSS problem. Simple BSS algorithms together with fractional sampling are shown to recover data in individual bands in the presence of ACI and ISI. For the FDMA overlapping channel, two approaches to improve the separation performance are also proposed, using prior information about the mixing matrix structure. We also compare the performances of different approaches for increasing the overall capacity. ^ The performance of BSS adaptive algorithms greatly depends on some nonlinear functions. The optimum nonlinear functions depend on the distributions of the original source signals which may be unknown. If there is a mismatch between assumed and true source distribution, the performance of the adaptive algorithm may degrade significantly. Therefore, robust BSS is very desirable in such cases. We propose a new approach for robust BSS using ranks of observed signals. Two different ranking methods are introduced for rank computation. In addition, we consider nonlinear functions restricted to being piecewise linear for use in adaptive BSS. The general expressions for the optimum M-interval piecewise linear functions are obtained based on optimization of convergence and steady state error performance. A 3 -interval adaptive piecewise linear function is proposed for separating sub/super-Gaussian sources. Simulation examples are presented showing good robust performance. ...|$|R
40|$|Orthogonal {{frequency-division}} multiplexing (OFDM) is communication technique that is robust against multipath spread, efficient in equalization implementation, and flexible in dynamic spectrum usage. With {{the need of}} wideband signals in high data rate communications, OFDM has gained widespread attention and usage as an efficient way of implementing multicarrier communication. Despite its prominent advantages, received signal quality degrades because of inter-symbol interference (IS) and inter-carrier interference (ICI) due to insufficient guard time in multipath channels and time variance as well as hardware impairments in OFDM systems. When several of the impairments occurs simultaneously, interferences combine at the receiver side. Thus, interference awareness becomes important concept for OFDM-based systems that are excepted to be highly adaptive for coping with existing impairment. By identifying the type {{and the source of}} the interference, mitigation of the impacts with corresponding adaptation in the system increases the performance of the overall system. In this thesis, self-interference identification, visualization, and separation of various type of interferences in OFDM systems have been studied. An interference spectrogram is developed {{in order to be able}} to investigate several interferences with one diagram solely. Identification of different sources of interference that result in same consequences at the receiver, such as ISI due to insufficient guard time and ICI due to time variance in the channel, is performed. Also, powers of corresponding interferences are estimated separately with the proposed technique. Computer simulations and measurements also confirmed the effectiveness of the interference separation method. Information symbols are represented in various domains of electro space such as time, frequency, and code. Channel impairments have different effects on the symbols in different domains. For instance, multipath spread causes ISI in single carrier systems while interference between symbols occurs when time variance exists in OFDM <b>systems.</b> Visualization <b>and</b> measurement of distortions in various domains need to be addressed for better understanding of multidimensional <b>communication</b> <b>systems</b> <b>and</b> their performance under distortion. Therefore, eye diagram in frequency domain for OFDM-based signals is introduced for visualization and identification of time varying impairments such as frequency spread and carrier frequency offset. Real channel measurements are performed to illustrate the effectiveness of the method in practical cases. The study conducted in this thesis can be utilized for interference awareness in OFDM-based wireless <b>communication</b> <b>systems.</b> Also, <b>methods</b> <b>and</b> diagrams that are developed can be used for testing the wireless <b>systems,</b> interference measurements, <b>and</b> educational purposes...|$|R
