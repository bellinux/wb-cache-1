40|$|Accurate {{models of}} {{planetary}} boundary layer (PBL) processes are important for forecasting weather and climate. The present study compares seven methods of calculating PBL depth in the GEOS- 5 atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) over land. These methods depend on the eddy diffusion coefficients, bulk and local Richardson numbers, and the turbulent kinetic energy. The computed PBL depths are aggregated to the Koppen <b>climate</b> <b>classes,</b> and some limited comparisons are made using radiosonde profiles. Most methods produce similar midday PBL depths, although in the warm, moist <b>climate</b> <b>classes,</b> the bulk Richardson number method gives midday results that are lower than those given by the eddy diffusion coefficient methods. Additional analysis revealed that methods sensitive to turbulence driven by radiative cooling produce greater PBL depths, this effect being most significant during the evening transition. Nocturnal PBLs based on Richardson number are generally shallower than eddy diffusion coefficient based estimates. The bulk Richardson number estimate is recommended as the PBL height to inform {{the choice of the}} turbulent length scale, based on the similarity to other methods during the day, and the improved nighttime behavior...|$|E

40|$|The surface {{radiation}} budget {{of a region}} is strongly tied to its climate. An 8 -yr climatology of surface {{radiation budget}} components for 2. 5 deg over the earth is examined {{in order to learn}} how the regional climate and surface radiation are related. The yearly cycles of a few individual regions were studied by plotting monthly mean net longwave flux as a function of net shortwave flux at the surface. These plots show trajectories that are characteristic of the climate class. The behavior of the trajectories of surface radiation and their relation to the regional climate can be understood with simple conceptual models for many cases. From an examination of these trajectories, a set of parameters is developed, such as mean net longwave flux and range of net shortwave flux, which distinguish various <b>climate</b> <b>classes</b> {{on the basis of the}} surface radiation. These criteria are applied to produce a map of regional <b>climate</b> <b>classes</b> based on surface radiation, similar to those of Koeppen or Trewartha and Horn, which were based on vegetation, temperature, and precipitation. The current maps can be used to explore the relationships between surface radiation and regional climate...|$|E

An important element of the thesis is <b>climate</b> of the <b>class,</b> its typology, creators and everyone affecting the <b>class</b> <b>climate.</b> Large part of the thesis is dedicated to factors creating <b>class</b> <b>climate.</b> In general to all the teachers, more specifically class teachers, but also pupils themselves and their parents.

40|$|Large point {{sources such}} as major {{population}} centers (MPCs) emit pollutants which can be deposited nearby or transported over long distances before deposition. We have used tracer simulations of aerosols emitted from MPCs worldwide to assess the fractions which are deposited at various distances away from their source location. Considering only source location, prevailing meteorology, and the aerosol size and solubility, we show that fine aerosol particles have a high potential to pollute remote regions. About half of the emitted mass of aerosol tracers with an ambient diameter Ã¢ÂÂ¤ 1. 0 ÃÂ¼m is typically deposited in regions more than 1000 km away from the source. Furthermore, using the KÃÂ¶ppen-Geiger climate classification to categorize the sources into various <b>climate</b> <b>classes</b> we find substantial differences in the deposition potential between these classes. Tracers originating in arid regions show the largest remote deposition potentials, with values more than doubled compared to the smallest potentials from tracers in tropical regions. Seasonal changes in atmospheric conditions lead to variations in the remote deposition potentials. On average the remote deposition potentials in summer correspond to about 70 Ã¢ÂÂ 80 % of the values in winter, with a large spread among the <b>climate</b> <b>classes.</b> For tracers from tropical regions the summer remote deposition values are only about 31 % of the winter values, while they are about 95 % for tracers from arid regions...|$|E
40|$|The {{knowledge}} of indoor air humidity {{in the design}} phase is important {{to decide on the}} appropriate moisture control measures to prevent moisture problems in building components. Because of the uncertain nature of most of the factors affecting the indoor humidity, its accurate prediction in the design phase is not possible. To overcome this problem, the concept of ‘Indoor <b>Climate</b> <b>Classes</b> ’ has been introduced and used in Europe since its early development in the Netherlands in the 1970 ’s up to its recent introduction in a European Standard on the hygrothermal performance of building components. The concept allows to make a rough quantification of the indoor humidity on the basis of building type and function in order to evaluate the moisture performance of building components in the design phase. The first part of the paper gives an introduction to the concept of indoor <b>climate</b> <b>classes</b> and reviews the methodologies to define the boundaries between different classes. The second part of the paper presents a model to predict the transient indoor humidity, based on a physical analysis of the mass balance of an enclosure (vapor production, ventilation and moisture storage in building materials). The model is applied to discuss the different factors affecting the humidity in a room and to guide the classification of humidity in dwellings...|$|E
40|$|Climatic classifications {{systems are}} {{important}} to analyze and define the climatic types of regions. The Koppen-Geiger and Thornthwaite system are widely applied on different topics related to climate research and climate change. The first is based on seasonal and annual and monthly average values of air temperature and precipitation, but is very laborious and complex. On the other hand, the second is based on concepts of potential evapotranspiration by water balance, but presents problems for classifying regions of polar and cold climates. The use of geographic information systems (GIS) {{for the study of}} complex situations has shown effective results especially in the modeling of climate prediction. In this context, the objective {{of this study was to}} compare the climatic classification of Thornthwaite with the Koppen-Geiger both applied to the boundaries of Brazil using GIS in order to observe the correlation between <b>climate</b> <b>classes</b> for the two systems. The evaluation of comparing the two climatic classifications were developed through the use of two maps representing each of the systems of climatic classification, through the process of overlapping and intersecting verifying the occurrence between the two classes of systems by developing a matrix of confusion.

40|$|An {{understanding}} of the diurnal cycle of surface radiation is fundamental to modeling climate. For example, deep convection is initiated by the solar heating of the surface during the day, and the height to which the convection carries heat, water vapor and momentum greatly influences the resulting global circulation. The NASA/GEWEX surface radiation budget (SRB) data set is {{used to examine the}} relation of the diurnal cycles to regional climate for the average July. Over land, the net shortwave flux (SWN) at the surface provides the driving energy for the diurnal cycle of the surface temperature, which creates the diurnal cycle of the longwave upward flux (LWU). The boundary layer heating results in the cycle of longwave downward flux (LWD). The diurnal cycles of SWN, LWU and LWD over land can each be described to first order as a principal component for the time variation and a geographical coefficient, which is the empirical orthogonal function. The coefficient map is partitioned into <b>climate</b> <b>classes,</b> and a two-dimensional histogram in the domain of LWU and SWN is constructed for each class. The points cluster {{in different parts of the}} domain according to the climate class. These clusters are explained by the circulation and cloud patterns of the <b>climate</b> <b>classes.</b> For ocean, the processes are different. Since the surface skin temperature is held constant during the day-night in the SRB data set, the diurnal cycle of LWU over ocean is neglected in this study. Hence, the diurnal cycle of LWD over ocean is due to the absorption of shortwave flux within the atmosphere...|$|E

40|$|Climate {{classification}} systems, such as Köppen–Geiger and the aridity index, {{are used}} in large-scale drought studies to stratify regions with similar hydro-climatic drought properties. What is currently lacking is a large-scale evaluation {{of the relation between}} climate and observed streamflow drought characteristics. In this study we explored how suitable common climate classifications are for differentiating catchments according to their characteristic hydrologic drought duration and whether drought durations within the same <b>climate</b> <b>classes</b> are comparable between different regions. This study uses a dataset of 808 near-natural streamflow records from Europe and the USA to answer these questions. First, we grouped drought duration distributions of each record over different classes of four climate classification systems and five individual climate and catchment controls. Then, we compared these drought duration distributions of all classes within each climate classification system or classification based on individual controls. Results showed that climate classification systems that include absolute precipitation in their classification scheme (e. g., the aridity index) are most suitable for differentiating catchments according to drought duration. However, differences in duration distributions were found for the same <b>climate</b> <b>classes</b> in Europe and the USA. These differences are likely caused by differences in precipitation, in catchment controls as expressed by the base flow index and in differences in climate beyond the total water balance (e. g., seasonality in precipitation), which have been shown to exert a control on drought duration as well. Climate classification systems that include an absolute precipitation control can be tailored to drought monitoring and early warning systems for Europe and the USA to define regions with different sensitivities to hydrologic droughts, which, for example, {{have been found to be}} higher in catchments with a low aridity index. However, stratification of catchments according to these climate classification systems is likely to be complemented with information of other climate classification systems (Köppen–Geiger) and individual climate and catchment controls (precipitation and the base flow index), especially in a comparative study between Europe and the USA...|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{energy use}} has caused many {{environmental}} problems including global warming. Energy use is growing rapidly {{in developing countries}} and surprisingly a remarkable portion of it is associated with consumed energy to keep the temperature comfortable inside the buildings. Therefore, identifying renewable technologies for cooling and heating is essential. This study introduced applications of steel sheets integrated into the buildings to save energy based on existing technologies. In addition, the proposed application {{was found to have}} a considerable chance of market success. Also, satisfying energy needs for space heating and cooling in a single room by using one of the selected applications in different Köppen <b>climate</b> <b>classes</b> was investigated to estimate which climates have a proper potential for benefiting from the application. This study included three independent parts and the results related to each part have been used in the next part. The first part recognizes six different technologies through literature review including Cool Roof, Solar Chimney, Steel Cladding of Building, Night Radiative Cooling, Elastomer Metal Absorber, and Solar Distillation. The second part evaluated the application of different technologies by gathering the experts’ ideas via performing a Delphi method. The results showed that the Solar Chimney has a proper chance for the market. The third part simulated both a solar chimney and a solar chimney with evaporation which were connected to a single well insulated room with a considerable thermal mass. The combination was simulated as a system to estimate the possibility of satisfying cooling needs and heating needs in different <b>climate</b> <b>classes.</b> A Trombe-wall was selected as a sample design for the Solar Chimney and was simulated in different climates. The results implied that the solar chimney had the capability of reducing the cooling needs more than 25 % in all of the studied locations and 100 % in some locations with dry or temperate climate such as Mashhad, Madrid, and Istanbul. It was also observed that the heating needs were satisfied more than 50 % in all of the studied locations, even for the continental climate such as Stockholm and 100 % in most locations with a dry climate.

These components include the downward, upward, and net shortwave radiant fluxes at the earth's surface. The seasonal cycles are quantified in terms of principal components that describe the temporal variations and empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) that describe the spatial patterns. The {{major part of the}} variation is simply due to the variation of the insolation {{at the top of the}} atmosphere, especially for the first term, which describes 92. 4 % of the variance for the downward shortwave flux. However, for the second term, which describes 4. 1 % of the variance, the effect of clouds is quite important and the effect of clouds dominates the third term, which describes 2. 4 % of the variance. To a large degree the second and third terms are due to the response of clouds to the annual cycle of solar forcing. For net shortwave flux at the surface, similar variances are described by each term.

The ASHRAE intermediate model seemed to be the most robust exhibiting lower errors when compared to measured data. The European Indoor Class also performed well and can be used when data regarding moisture generation and/or air change rates is not available.

40|$|The Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, in {{collaboration}} with Oxford University, has developed a European environmental classification for the assessment and monitoring of {{effects of climate change}} on biodiversity at different spatial scales. The classification was constructed using various multivariate techniques from the database for 5500 half by half degree cells for the wider European window, developed by the University of East Anglia (UEA) for the TIGER programme. A statistical rule set created from the classification allows any cell size down to 1 x 1 km to be allocated to one of the 64 classes from its climate and altitude characteristics. Currently, this procedure has been used at its original resolution of half by half degree cell size across Europe and at a 10 x 10 km cell size across Great Britain. A number of climate change scenarios from different climate models provided by UEA have been assessed using the allocation procedure. By using the outputs from these climate models, the predicated movement of <b>climate</b> <b>classes</b> can be determined throughout Europe and at higher resolution for Great Britain. At the European scale, the greatest predicted changes in environmental diversity occur in Iberia and around the Mediterranean fringe. These areas show substantial decreases in the diversity of the region indicated by a fall in the number of classes present mainly due to the extension of two arid classes. The other major changes are in Northeast Europe where large uniform classes were sensitive to the scenarios but the implications are more difficult to determine. Using the half x half degree resolution, major changes can be seen in Great Britain with areas north and west of the Severn / Wash line becoming more oceanic where as those to the south and east becoming more continental. When the same scenarios are imposed in Great Britain using the 10 x 10 km resolution a new climate class was identified as being present whose distribution is centred in eastern Denmark. This is because the half by half degree cells smooth local variation. Two hyper-oceanic classes also extended to the east with implications biodiversity. The different scenarios show <b>climate</b> <b>classes</b> with continental affinities moving into Britain agreeing with other results from the TIGER programme. This ability to draw on classes from outside the immediate domain is an important feature of this classification when carrying out assessment at a local scale. Within Great Britain particular areas are seen {{to be sensitive to the}} predicted change when using the higher resolution e. g. the Cairngorm plateau is affected by the extension of oceanic classes. Such changes have important implications for vegetation, habitats and biodiversity. Isolated populations of plants at the edge of their distribution are likely to be affected by such changes because there are no refuges to retreat to. Further implications of the scenarios will be considered in conjunction with the recent empirical evidence of climate change. Further applications of the classification will also be discussed...|$|E
40|$|Climate {{change is}} the main global {{challenge}} of this century; it is therefore imperative to identify its effects on agriculture in developing countries. This research makes spatial assessment of climate change effect on major plantation crops in Sri Lanka, with emphasis on crop suitability of tea, rubber, and coconut. Geo-referenced maps of spatial and temporal changes in crop suitability and production potentials are generated and compared. Data pertaining to six agro-ecological zones under the study area are analyzed {{for a period of}} 1980 - 2007. Crop suitability maps are generated amalgamating yield maps and climatic factors maps using AHP in multi-criteria analysis under two time frames of 1980 - 1992 and 1993 - 2007. Percent change in crop suitability and crop yield classes is calculated based on five crop suitability and five crop yield classes during two time frames. Dynamics of climatic parameters and crop yield are recognized using geo-referenced maps. The suitability maps of the two time frames are compared to identify the changes with each crop in conjunction with changes in the prevailing climate and yield. Geographic shift of suitability, yield, and <b>climate</b> <b>classes</b> are examined. Net gain or loss in crop production is quantified. Long-termannual rainfall significantly decreased in mid-country wet zone, whereas the mean temperature of the study area increased by 1. 4 "C. Results clearly showed that the climate and yield can be meaningfully related to the crop suitability and management. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
50|$|The nearest {{alternative}} {{pass through}} the Pennines is Stainmore Gap (Eden-Tees) to the North, {{but that is not}} in Craven’s league for it climbs to 420 m and its <b>climate</b> is <b>classed</b> as sub-arctic in places.|$|R
50|$|Outside of {{isolated}} sections of Mexico, the southernmost limits of this climate in North America lie {{just north of}} South Florida and around southern coastal Texas. Cities at the southernmost limits, such as Tampa and Orlando and along the Texas coast around Corpus Christi down toward Brownsville generally feature warm weather year-round and minimal temperature differences between seasons. In contrast, cities at the northernmost limits of the humid subtropical region (using the Köppen climate classification system) such as Philadelphia and Louisville, Kentucky feature hot, humid summers and chilly winters. These areas have average winter temperatures at the coldest limit of <b>climates</b> <b>classed</b> as humid subtropical.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine whether <b>class</b> <b>climate</b> and <b>class</b> moral {{disengagement}} each contribute to explain different levels of victimisation among classes. Eight-hundred-and-ninety-nine children from 43 Swedish elementary school classes participated in the current study. Class moral disengagement, <b>class</b> relational <b>climate</b> and peer victimisation were assessed by a self-report questionnaire. In order to account for the clustered nature of the data with students nested within school classes, a multilevel regression model was analysed. Consistent with our hypotheses, and after controlling for age, gender and ethnic background at the individual level and class size and the proportion of boys at the class level, both <b>class</b> relational <b>climate</b> and <b>class</b> moral disengagement uniquely contributed to explaining the between-class variance in victimisation. Thus, the findings suggested that victimisation is less likely to occur in classes characterised by a positive, warm, fair and supportive relational pattern between children and between teachers and children, and by lower levels of class moral disengagement...|$|R
