40|$|With {{the end of}} {{the pure}} {{component}} property data base project approx. 90 000 data sets containing more than 570 000 table lines from approx. 10 000 references are available in electronic form. The work was performed in cooperation with groups in Prague, Berlin, Tallinn and Minsk. In addition to collecting experimental data different correlation methods were implemented and used to test the correctness and consistency of the data. More than 8000 parameter sets were regressed for different correlation equations and physical properties. By storing the molecular structures of more than 12000 components and developing programs for input, storage and fragmentation of these structures a large number of group <b>contribution</b> <b>methods</b> from literature are readily available also for the untrained user. With this simple possibility to estimate properties using group <b>contribution</b> <b>methods</b> and the availability of a large database, a broad test of published group <b>contribution</b> <b>methods</b> can be performed.

Furthermore the solution of groups concept has been applied to equations of state.

40|$|Motivation: Group <b>contribution</b> <b>methods</b> are {{frequently}} used for estimating physical properties of compounds from their molecular structures. An algorithm for estimating Gibbs energies of formation through group <b>contribution</b> <b>methods</b> has been automated in an object-oriented framework. The algorithm decomposes compound structures {{according to a}} basis set of groups. It permits the use of wildcards {{and is able to}} distinguish between ring groups and chain groups that use similar search structures. Past methods relied on manual decomposition of compounds into constituent groups. Results: The software is written in Common LISP and requires < 2 min to estimate Gibbs energies of formation for a database of 780 species of varying size and complexity. The software allows rapid expansion to incorporate different basis sets and to estimate a variety of other physical properties. Availability: Available on request from the authors...|$|R

Group <b>contribution</b> <b>methods</b> are important skills for predicting properties of innumerable types of compounds because they enable the representation of an immense quantity of mixtures. In this work, viscosities of both pure biodiesels and blends derived from various oleaginous plants were estimated. To accomplish this, three group <b>contribution</b> estimation <b>methods</b> were evaluated, one of them being specific for fatty compounds. The mixture was simulated according to two mixing rules, and the precision of the methods were compared to the experimental data.

50|$|A typical group <b>contribution</b> <b>method</b> using group {{interaction}} {{values is}} the UNIFAC method which estimates activity coefficients. A big disadvantage {{of the group}} interaction model {{is the need for}} many more model parameters.

Therefore a group interaction model has normally not parameter for all possible combinations.|$|E
50|$|Today the UNIQUAC {{model is}} {{frequently}} {{applied in the}} description of phase equilibria (i.e. liquid-solid, liquid-liquid or liquid-vapor equilibrium).

50|$|As a group <b>contribution</b> <b>method</b> the Klincewicz method {{correlates}} some structural {{information of}} a chemical molecule with the critical data. The used structural information are small functional groups which are assumed to have no interactions.

The correlation method does not even use these functional groups, only the molecular weight and the number of atoms are used as molecular descriptors.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} a set of binary systems for developing necessary thermodynamic models for oil and biofuel industries. Extensive experimental work was performed for supplying the necessary vapor – liquid equilibria (VLE) and excess enthalpy data for the selected systems. Binary systems with C 4 hydrocarbons + alkenes, alcohols and ketones were measured due to their importance in production of fuel additives. Static total pressure apparatus was utilized for these isothermal measurements. Important for fuel purification, systems with sulfur containing compounds were measured using recirculation still apparatus at isothermal conditions. Several experimental techniques for VLE measurements were applied for investigation of furfural containing binary systems and for the 2 -methoxy- 2 -methylpropane (MIBK) + alcohol systems. Furfural can serve {{as one of the}} precursor in production of biofuel. Calorimetric measurements were also made for these systems using flow mixing calorimeter. Consistency of all experimental data was analyzed with four different consistency tests. The obtained experimental data were used for optimization of Wilson, NRTL an UNIQUAC model parameters and for validation of predictive group contribution model UNIFAC(Dortmund) and predictive COSMO-RS model. A method for improving group <b>contribution</b> <b>methods</b> is suggested. The distance weighting technique takes into account similarity of the compounds for optimization of the group contribution parameters. The suggested method is applicable to linearized group <b>contribution</b> <b>methods.</b> Normal boiling points of the pure compounds were predicted applying new technique to Joback – Reid and Marrero – Gani group <b>contribution</b> <b>methods.</b> Average improvement of the normal boiling point predictions was 6 K for the Joback – Reid method and 4 K for the Marrero – Gani method...|$|R

50|$|A group <b>contribution</b> <b>method</b> {{uses the}} {{principle}} that some simple aspects of the structures of chemical components are always the same in many different molecules. The smallest common constituents are the atoms and the bonds. The vast majority of organic components, for example, are built of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, halogens, and maybe sulfur or phosphorus. Together with a single, a double, and a triple bond there are only ten atom types (not including astatine) and three bond types to build thousands of components. The next slightly more complex building blocks of components are functional groups which are themselves built of few atoms and bonds.|$|E
