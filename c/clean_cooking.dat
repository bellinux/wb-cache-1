40|$|At present, {{the main}} cooking fuels inChinaare natural gas, coal gas, {{liquefied}} petroleum gas (LPG), coal, biogas, wood and straw. This paper reviews the characteristics, advantages, disadvantages and the current application status of these different cooking fuels. Moreover, a questionnaire survey is presented, dealing with different cooking fuels in Chinese households and the occupants’ perceived health, ventilation behaviors and general knowledge in potential health hazards. About 56 % of the respondents of the questionnaire survey stated that symptoms like itching eyes, dry or irritated throat, irritated nose, running or blocked nose and headache were worse when they were cooking in their kitchens. This suggests that cooking fuel combustion has a significant influence on human health. The most evident health effect was that wood and straw as cooking fuel caused eye irritation. The present common house planning in Chinese countryside, where the kitchens are separated {{from the rest of}} the house via a courtyard, is very likely to reduce the stove contaminant exposure of all occupants.   In general, the main cooking fuels of the cities tend to be better than the cooking fuels of the countryside. Natural gas appears to be the <b>cleanest</b> <b>cooking</b> fuel among all urban cooking fuels except electricity.

This paper introduces a method for evaluating the status and progress of rural household energy sustainability in developing countries using a new composite indicator, the energy sustainability index (ESI). The ESI combines 13 techno-economic, environmental and social indicators of sustainability using principal component analysis (PCA). We apply the ESI to China, India, South Africa, Sri-Lanka, Bangladesh and Ghana between 1990 and 2010. The analysis suggests that South Africa's rural energy sustainability index is highest followed by China, Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh and Ghana respectively. All the countries' rural energy sustainability has improved relatively over time except Ghana's. Improvements result mainly from increasing rural electricity use and increasing access to <b>clean</b> and efficient <b>cooking</b> fuels...|$|R

50|$|One {{environmental}} exposure {{which has been}} found to increase the risk of low birth weight is particulate matter, a component of ambient air pollution. Because particulate matter is composed of extremely small particles, even nonvisible levels can be inhaled and present harm to the fetus. Particulate matter exposure can cause inflammation, oxidative stress, endocrine disruption, and impaired oxygen transport access to the placenta, all of which are mechanisms for heightening the risk of low birth weight. To reduce exposure to particulate matter, pregnant women can monitor the EPA’s Air Quality Index and take personal precautionary measures such as reducing outdoor activity on low quality days, avoiding high-traffic roads/intersections, and/or wearing personal protective equipment (i.e., facial mask of industrial design). Indoor exposure to particulate matter can also be reduced through adequate ventilation, as well as use of <b>clean</b> heating and <b>cooking</b> methods.|$|R

40|$|According to the {{capability}} approach developed by Sen (1993), access to basic energy services enables capabilities such as good health, education and balanced nourishment, that further increases overall well-being. Deprivation of energy services leads to energy poverty and reduced well-being. There {{are millions of}} people without access to <b>clean</b> <b>cooking</b> facilities and electricity in the world today, a {{majority of them are}} located in developing countries. It is crucial to tackle these problems, reduce energy poverty and advance sustainable development. In order to do so, good measures of energy poverty are needed to identify the energy poor and develop targeted and relevant policies and solutions. Thus, the aim of the thesis is to measure basic energy deprivations, by using an adapted energy poverty index. Energy poverty is evaluated based on the dimensions of access to <b>clean</b> <b>cooking</b> fuels, access to electricity and access to the most basic energy services. The novelty of the measure is to combine these three dimensions into a composite index using the methodology of the Multidimensional Energy Poverty Index, developed by Nussbaumer, Bazilian & Modi (2011). A multidimensional deprivation score is used to evaluate energy poverty across the three dimensions. The measure is applied to study energy poverty in India. The results indicate that there are great differences in the level of access that the various Indian states have to certain basic energy services. The extent of deprivation is greatest in the dimension of access to <b>clean</b> <b>cooking</b> facilities. Rural and lower income groups tend to have more energy poverty than urban groups and higher income groups, respectively. Thus, these are certain groups that policymakers should prioritize. Continued analysis of energy poverty in India and other regions is useful for making spatial and temporal comparisons to monitor progress and provide recommendations for reducing energy poverty...|$|E

The objectives of this work are to examine households’ access to energy, to measure energy poverty, to demonstrate spatial disparity in energy poverty and to establish a relationship between energy poverty and factors of energy access. The study used data published by the National Bureau of Statistics on energy access and parameters that may influence consumption of energy. These data are electricity connection to national grid by households and the use of <b>clean</b> energy for <b>cooking</b> by the households. Energy poverty is determined on the basis of Energy Development Index [EDI] and regression analysis is used to establish a statistical relationship between energy poverty and the possible determining factors.
