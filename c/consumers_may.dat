5|$|Duration: For most goods, {{the longer}} a price change holds, {{the higher the}} {{elasticity}} is likely to be, {{as more and more}} consumers find they have the time and inclination to search for substitutes. When fuel prices increase suddenly, for instance, <b>consumers</b> <b>may</b> still fill up their empty tanks in the short run, but when prices remain high over several years, more consumers will reduce their demand for fuel by switching to carpooling or public transportation, investing in vehicles with greater fuel economy or taking other measures. This does not hold for consumer durables such as the cars themselves, however; eventually, it may become necessary for consumers to replace their present cars, so one would expect demand to be less elastic.|$|E

25|$|Others {{have noted}} that relying on BoP {{consumers}} to choose to purchase items that increase their incomes is naive. Poor <b>consumers</b> <b>may</b> spend their income disproportionately on events or goods and services that offer short-term benefits rather than invest in things that could change {{their lives in the}} long-term.|$|E
25|$|Frappuccinos {{may include}} {{additional}} ingredients, which can include espresso shots, flavored syrups, chocolatey chips, and flavored powders. <b>Consumers</b> <b>may</b> also customize {{the consistency of}} Frappuccinos by ordering light or extra ice. Any Frappuccino can have additional syrups, shots of espresso, or various other modifications at a possible surcharge.|$|E
25|$|Costco {{introduced}} Kirkland Signature as its {{private label}} in 1992. The {{idea was to}} provide brand name quality products at discounted prices. To counteract the consumer confidence problem common in store branding, Kirkland Signature occasionally employs co-branding. According to Costco, while <b>consumers</b> <b>may</b> be wary of same-store-branding, {{they are less likely}} to be wary of brands that they are familiar with and trust.|$|E

An urban <b>consumer</b> <b>may</b> have 5 metres of 15 mm pipe running from the iron main, so the kitchen tap flow will be fairly unrestricted, so high flow. A rural <b>consumer</b> <b>may</b> have a kilometre of rusted and limed 22 mm iron pipe, so their kitchen tap flow will be small.|$|R

The amounts of the credit are $30 for a person filing a return with one exemption, $40 for two exemptions, $50 for three exemptions, and $60 for four or more exemptions. This amount includes interest and is {{based on the}} tax paid by an average American household during the lookback period.|$|E

25|$|ARMs {{generally}} permit borrowers {{to lower}} their initial payments if {{they are willing to}} assume the risk of interest rate changes. There is evidence that consumers tend to prefer contracts with the lowest initial rates, such as in the UK where consumers tend to focus on immediate monthly mortgage costs. Decisions of <b>consumers</b> <b>may</b> also be affected by the advice they get, and much of the advice is provided by lenders who may prefer ARMs because of financial market structures.|$|E
25|$|The Adapter was {{developed}} by Mad Catz by experimenting with all legacy Xbox 360 controllers they wanted to support and verifying what inputs they sent via wireless connection. They also worked with a former Microsoft employee that had experience with the Xbox 360's wireless features for additional insight. Existing USB microphones remain compatible with Rock Band 4. Harmonix was also working to get backward compatibility for the Stage Kit, an add-on hardware unit for Xbox 360 owners that allowed for a smoke machine and light show display {{in time with the}} song. Owing to the game's focus on core gameplay, and concerns that <b>consumers</b> <b>may</b> be unwilling to buy additional hardware for specific games early in a console generation's lifecycle, Rock Band 4 did not feature additional accessories. At retail, the game is available in a band bundle, with a guitar, drum, and microphone, and a guitar-only bundle.|$|E
25|$|In {{many social}} {{networking}} services or e-commerce websites, users can provide text review, comment or {{feedback to the}} items. These user-generated text provide {{a rich source of}} user's sentiment opinions about numerous products and items. Potentially, for an item, such text can reveal both the related feature/aspects of the item and the users' sentiments on each feature. The item's feature/aspects described in the text play the same role with the meta-data in content-based filtering, but the former are more valuable for the recommender system. Since these features are broadly mentioned by users in their reviews, they {{can be seen as the}} most crucial features that can significantly influence the user's experience on the item, while the meta-data of the item (usually provided by the producers instead of <b>consumers)</b> <b>may</b> ignore features that are concerned by the users. For different items with common features, a user may give different sentiments. Also, a feature of the same item may receive different sentiments from different users. Users' sentiments on the features can be regarded as a multi-dimensional rating score, reflecting their preference on the items.|$|E

25|$|Most Indian {{shopping}} {{happens in}} open markets or numerous small grocery and retail shops. Shoppers typically wait outside the shop, ask {{for what they}} want, and can not pick or examine a product from the shelf. Access to the shelf or product storage area is limited. Once the shopper requests the food staple or household product they are looking for, the shopkeeper goes to the container or shelf or {{to the back of}} the store, brings it out and offers it for sale to the shopper. Often the shopkeeper may substitute the product, claiming that it is similar or equivalent to the product the consumer is asking for. The product typically has no price label in these small retail shops; all packaged products must display the maximum retail price (MRP) above which the product cannot be sold. It is a criminal offence to sell a product beyond the MRP of a product. The shopkeeper can price the food staple and household products arbitrarily, and two <b>consumers</b> <b>may</b> pay different prices for the same product on the same day but never will those price be above the maximum retail price. Price is rarely negotiated between the shopper and shopkeeper. The shoppers usually do not have time to examine the product label, and do not have a choice to make an informed decision between competitive products.|$|E

More than 90,000 consumer complaints and inquiries {{each year are}} submitted to the Attorney General. Many of those complaints are resolved through mediation by the AG. In cases where a company's actions have been determined to be in violation of Missouri's consumer protection law, complaints lead to legal action. Some complaints are frivolous.

However, product life duration, as an experience attribute of the product, has complex effects on the consumer's attitudes and behaviors, and several factors may moderate those effects. The present exploratory study enlightens the variables determining consumer expectations about life duration, and those moderating the effects of abnormally short product duration on consumer response.

2500|$|In the United States, {{retail sales}} {{are often in}} units of therms (th); 1 therm = 100,000BTU. Gas meters measure the volume of gas used, and this is {{converted}} to therms by multiplying the volume by the energy content of the gas used during that period, which varies slightly over time. Wholesale transactions are generally done in decatherms (Dth), or in thousand decatherms (MDth), or in million decatherms (MMDth). A million decatherms is roughly a billion cubic feet of natural gas. [...] Gas sales to domestic <b>consumers</b> <b>may</b> be in units of 100 standard cubic feet (scf). The typical annual consumption of a single family residence is 1,000 therms or one RCE.|$|E

Opponents, such as Dean Russell in The TVA Idea, in addition to condemning the project as being socialist, argued that TVA created a [...] "hidden loss" [...] by preventing the creation of [...] "factories and jobs that would have come into existence if the government had allowed the taxpayers to spend their money as they wished." [...] Defenders note that TVA is overwhelmingly popular in Tennessee among conservatives and liberals alike, as Barry Goldwater discovered in 1964, when he proposed selling the agency.|$|E
