40|$|An {{analytical}} method was adapted to extract semi-volatile organic compounds (SOCs) from <b>conifer</b> <b>needles.</b> Needles from Abies concolor (white fir) and Pinus contortas (lodgepole pine) from Sequoia National Park (SNP) were {{collected during the}} summer of 2003, and analyzed for SOCs. The goal of this research was to determine differences between one and two year old coniferous growths, differences between species, and compare deposition of SOCs in <b>conifer</b> <b>needles</b> and lichen. Eleven, primarily agricultural, SOCs were found on <b>conifer</b> <b>needles</b> from the two species, in the range of 0. 0436 ng/g to 8. 267 ng/g (dry weight). One year old growth generally had lower concentrations of SOCs than two year old growth, and white fir needles had generally higher concentrations of SOCs than lodgepole pine. Lichen had higher SOC concentrations than the <b>conifer</b> <b>needles,</b> but the age of the lichen samples was difficult to determine. T his study demonstrates t hat S OC concentration on <b>conifer</b> <b>needles</b> increases with exposure time to the atmosphere, but that concentration of SOCs may vary between species...|$|R

40|$|Gaps are {{unavoidable}} when compositing {{small or}} narrow plant parts (e. g., <b>conifer</b> <b>needles,</b> twigs, narrow leaves, and leaflets) on sample holders {{in preparation for}} measuring spectral optical properties. The Daughtry et al. (1989) (A new technique to measure the spectral properties of <b>conifer</b> <b>needles.</b> Remote Sens. Environ. 27 : 81 - 91.) method of measuring <b>conifer</b> <b>needle</b> optical properties utilizes a relatively large gap fraction (approximately 0. 3 - 0. 6) and needles painted black on one surface of the sample from which the gap fraction of the sample is indirectly determined. Following this protocol typically results in distortions in optical properties, including underestimates in transmittance (sometimes negative values), and only one surface of the sample can be measured. The objectives of this article are to: 1) evaluate the influence of gaps between sample elements (<b>conifer</b> <b>needles,</b> twigs, narrow leaves and leaflets) on optical properties calculated with the published equations from Daughtry et al. (1989) and 2) revise the original Daughtry et al. method for optical property measurements by using an imageanalysis to directly measure the gap fraction and use both surfaces of the sample. We achieve these objectives by reviewing the theory and investigating the effects of gaps by measurements of an inert photographic film material, fir needles, and mesquite leaflets. Tests to estimate the transmittance of film samples (film) and foliage (fir needles, mesquite leaflets) indicate that a relatively small gap fraction (less than 0. 20) reduces the occurrence of computed negative transmittance values, reduces the variation in computed values, and yields values expected for the «true 2 ̆ 2 or «nongap 2 ̆ 2 transmittance. Employing the image analysis along with reduced gap fractions decreased the variance of measurements and permitted measurements of both surfaces per sample, thus redUCing the time required by making half as many samples as Originally required by Daughtry et al...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2008 The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to compare four different media that were used to monitor SOC atmospheric concentrations in remote ecosystems. The accumulation of semi-volatile organic compounds, including pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), was investigated in lichen, 2 -year old <b>conifer</b> <b>needles,</b> resin-based passive air sampling devices (PASDs), and snow. In addition, an analytical method for the trace analysis of these SOCs in lichen, <b>conifer</b> <b>needles,</b> and SOCs in PASDs, was developed and validated. To evaluate the preferential accumulation of SOCs in these media, lichen and <b>conifer</b> <b>needles</b> were collected in 2004, PASDs were collected in 2006 after a 1 -year exposure period, and snowpack was collected in spring 2003 and 2004 from the same sites in 5 Western U. S. national parks (NPs), including Sequoia NP, Rocky Mtn. NP, Olympic NP, Glacier NP, and Denali NP. Endosulfan sulfate, a degradation product of the pesticide endosulfan, preferentially accumulated in lichen. Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and fluorene preferentially accumulated in PASDs, and dacthal, chlorpyrifos, dieldrin, acenapthene, and benzo[ghi]perylene preferentially accumulated in snow. Hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) and PCBs did not preferentially accumulate in any one medium. The influence of SOC physical-chemical properties, including air-water partition coefficient (KAW), octanol-air partition coefficient (Log KOA) and the estimated SOC fraction in the particle phase in the atmosphere (Φ), on accumulation in each medium was also investigated. The effect of SOC physical-chemical properties on medium accumulation was evaluated at all sites from which lichen, <b>conifer</b> <b>needles,</b> PASDs, and snow were collected (82, 85, 33, and 30 sites, respectively). These SOC physical-chemical properties significantly influenced the accumulation of dacthal, endosulfans, trans-chlordane, nonachlors, and several PAHs in several of the media. The results from this research indicate that pesticides and PAHs preferentially accumulate in snow. Therefore, snow should be used, if possible, in short-term studies (months) of SOC concentrations in the atmosphere of remote ecosystems during the winter months. However, lichen may be used instead of snow in warmer regions or for studies that require longer exposure periods and/or summer months. If lichen is not present in the ecosystem, <b>conifer</b> <b>needles</b> may be used; however the measurement of particle-phase SOCs may be limited by needle structure and estimated method detection limits (EDLs). Finally, PASDs may be used for studies interested in the concentration of specific gas-phase SOCs with residence times in the atmosphere over 1 year and for a more quantitative estimate of atmospheric concentrations...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTo a large extent, the {{invertebrate}} fauna in wooded streams {{rely upon}} detritus inputs {{from the surrounding}} vegetation as their main food source. Conifer plantations may alter the timing and nutritional quality of leaf inputs into streams, but detritus retention may also be reduced. While {{it has often been}} assumed that <b>conifer</b> <b>needles</b> are retained less than broadleaved species, this has never been tested experimentally. This study describes the results of a leaf release experiment carried out in a small headwater stream, comparing the retention of pine needles and oak leaves (wet and dry) over a range of discharges. In addition, retention was compared before and after placing logs in the stream to examine the effect of woody debris on retention efficiency. Retention efficiency was significantly different among the three leaf types tested with wet oak leaves being most retentive, followed by dry oak leaves with dry pine needles being least retentive. Retention efficiency declined significantly with increasing discharge for all three leaf types. The addition of logs increased the retention of dry oak leaves and pine needles, but not wet oak leaves. The predominant features (stones, logs, eddies and bankside vegetation) that accounted for retention varied with discharge and the leaf type used. The results indicate that while <b>conifer</b> <b>needles</b> may be inherently less retentive than broadleaves, the presence of woody debris within the stream channel increases their retention. However, this small-scale study would need to be expanded to investigate the retention dynamics of <b>conifer</b> <b>needles</b> in plantation streams.

40|$|The Péclet {{correction}} {{is often}} used to predict leaf evaporative enrichment and requires an estimate of effective path length (L). Studies to estimate L in <b>conifer</b> <b>needles</b> have produced unexpected patterns based on Péclet theory and leaf anatomy. We exposed seedlings of six conifer species to different vapour pressure deficits (VPD) in controlled climate chambers to produce steady-state leaf water enrichment (in (18) O). We measured leaf gas exchange, stable oxygen isotopic composition (δ(18) O) of input and plant waters as well as leaf anatomical characteristics. Variation in bulk needle water δ(18) O was strongly related to VPD. <b>Conifer</b> <b>needles</b> had large amounts of water within the vascular strand that was potentially unenriched (up to 40 %). Both standard Craig-Gordon and Péclet models failed to accurately predict conifer leaf water δ(18) O without taking into consideration the unenriched water in the vascular strand and variable L. Although L was linearly related to mesophyll thickness, large within-species variation prevented the development of generalizations that could allow a broader use of the Péclet effect in predictive models.
