50|$|The African {{marsh harrier}} (<b>Circus</b> <b>ranivorus)</b> is a {{bird of prey}} {{belonging}} to the harrier genus Circus. It is largely resident in wetland habitats in southern, central and eastern Africa from South Africa north to South Sudan.|$|E
50|$|Outside of the Bubo genus, other owls in Africa {{are much}} smaller than Verreaux's eagle-owls {{and are more likely}} to be viewed as prey than competition. Among the small-to-mid-sized owls that have fallen prey to this species {{including}} the barn owl (Tyto alba) and the African grass owl (Tyto capensis), both of which average around 419 g in body mass in Africa, the 334 g marsh owl (Asio capensis) and the 216 g southern white-faced owl (Ptilopsis granti). The only verified interactions with other typical eagle-owls have been predatory, as the 645 g spotted eagle-owl has been recorded among their prey in a few cases. There are several owls was broadly similar habitat preferences from African scops owls (Otus senegalensis) to African wood owls (Strix woodfordii) that have not been reported as food but are almost certainly occasionally threatened by Verreaux's eagle-owls. As is commonly the case with eagle-owls, the Verreaux's eagle-owl is perhaps the most serious predatory threat to diurnal raptors in its range, most often ambushing raptors on their prominent nests upon nightfall and freely killing birds of prey of any age from nestlings to adults. Such prey is not quantitatively significant as a food source but since raptors as a rule are sparsely distributed the habitual visitation of a single or pair of Verreaux's eagle-owl can potentially be devastating to a local population. Among the species known to be attacked have included, among small-to-medium-sized raptors, include the 638 g African harrier-hawk (Polyboroides typus), the 675 g pale chanting goshawk (Melierax canorus), the 507 g African marsh harrier (<b>Circus</b> <b>ranivorus),</b> the 110 g scissor-tailed kite (Chelictinia riocourii), the 291.5 g African goshawk (Accipiter tachiro) the 875 g common buzzard (Buteo buteo) and the 640 g Wahlberg's eagle (Hieraaetus wahlbergi).|$|E
