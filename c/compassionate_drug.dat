50|$|The <b>Compassionate</b> Investigational New <b>Drug</b> program, or <b>Compassionate</b> IND, is a United States Federal Government-run Investigational New Drug program {{established}} in 1978 {{that allows a}} limited number of patients to use medical marijuana grown at the University of Mississippi.

40|$|Orphan {{drugs are}} drugs {{used in the}} {{treatment}} of life-threatening or chronic diseases that affect fewer than 1 out of 2000 persons in the European Union. Since the implementation of the European Regulation on Orphan Medicinal Products in 2000, 61 orphan drugs have been brought to market. One-third of these were granted their marketing authorisations based on non-comparative clinical research. Certain orphan drugs for extramural use will be transferred to the performance-based hospital financing system within the next few years. Unapproved orphan drugs are generally not reimbursed.

40|$|Clinical {{trials are}} the {{mainstay}} for bringing out newer and better drugs {{to serve the}} mankind. By virtue of participating in a clinical trial, a patient receives access to the newer drugs/therapies, but nothing is generally being offered to them once {{their participation in the}} study comes to an end. Though the issue of post-trial access to treatment by patients participating in a clinical trial is debatable, there is no compelling justification either for or against it. We examined a case study in order to evaluate the applicability of post-trial access to treatment for patients participating in clinical trials. The provision of post-trial access to treatment should also keep into consideration the <b>compassionate</b> use of <b>drugs</b> on humanitarian grounds, especially in cases of trial drugs that have offered significant benefit to the trial patients and whose termination would lead to deterioration in patient′s overall condition. In the present era of personalized medicine, the incorporation of genetic testing into clinical practice further authenticates the rationale of <b>compassionate</b> use of <b>drugs</b> and post-trial access to treatment...|$|R
5000|$|Despite an {{official}} policy denying the medical value of cannabis, {{the federal government}} began providing the drug to {{a limited number of}} patients through the <b>Compassionate</b> Investigational New <b>Drug</b> program in 1978. The program was created following a lawsuit filed by Robert Randall, a Washington, D.C. resident who was arrested for cultivating cannabis in 1975. [...] Citing the glaucoma that threatened to take his eyesight, Randall employed a [...] "medical necessity" [...] defense at trial to justify his use of cannabis. [...] The charges against Randall were dismissed, {{and as a result of}} an ensuing petition filed with the FDA, Randall became the first person to receive cannabis from the federal government in 1976. [...] After his supply was cut off in 1978, he filed a lawsuit to have it restored, setting in motion the creation of the <b>Compassionate</b> Investigational New <b>Drug</b> program shortly thereafter. [...] The program allowed patients with serious medical conditions to receive a regular supply of cannabis from the federal government; however, only 13 patients ended up participating due to the very complicated and drawn-out application process involved.|$|R

5000|$|NIDA administers a {{contract}} with the University of Mississippi to grow the nation's only legal cannabis crop for medical and research purposes, including the <b>Compassionate</b> Investigational New <b>Drug</b> program. United States federal law registers cannabis as a Schedule I drug. Medical marijuana researchers typically prefer to use high-potency marijuana, but NIDA's National Advisory Council on Drug Abuse has been reluctant to provide cannabis with high THC levels, citing safety concerns: Most clinical studies have been conducted using cannabis cigarettes with a potency of 2-4% THC. However, it is anticipated that there will be requests for cannabis cigarettes with a higher potency or with other mixes of cannabinoids. For example, NIDA has received a request for cigarettes with an 8% potency. The subcommittee notes that very {{little is known about the}} clinical pharmacology of this higher potency. Thus, while NIDA research has provided a large body of literature related to the clinical pharmacology of cannabis, research is still needed to establish the safety of new dosage forms and new formulations.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Metastatic {{melanoma}} {{patients with}} leptomeningeal disease (LMD) have an extremely poor prognosis and {{a paucity of}} effective treatment options. We assessed the safety and efficacy of intrathecal interleukin- 2 (IT IL- 2) in metastatic melanoma patients with LMD. METHODS: We reviewed the outcomes of 43 consecutive metastatic melanoma patients with LMD who were treated with IT IL- 2 from 2006 to 2014 in a <b>Compassionate</b> Investigational New <b>Drug</b> Study. All patients had evidence of LMD based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology, radiology, and/or surgical pathology. IL- 2 at a dose of 1. 2 mIU was administered intrathecally via Ommaya reservoir up to 5 times per week in the inpatient setting for 4 weeks; patients with good tolerance and clinical benefit received maintenance IT IL- 2 every 1 to 3 months thereafter. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 46. 7 years (range 18 - 71); 32 (74 %) were male; 31 (72 %) had positive CSF cytology, and 39 (91 %) had radiographic evidence of LMD. Median overall survival (OS) from initiation of IT IL- 2 was 7. 8 months (range, 4. 7 - 16. 3 months), with 1 -, 2 -, and 5 -year OS rates of 36 %, 26 %, and 13 %. The presence of neurological symptoms (HR 2. 1, p= 0. 03), positive baseline CSF cytology (HR 4. 1, p= 0. 001) and concomitant use of targeted therapy (HR 3. 0, p= 0. 02) were associated with shorter OS on univariate analysis. All patients developed symptoms due to increased intracranial pressure. There were no treatment-related deaths. CONCLUSION: IT IL- 2 treatment is safe and achieves long-term survival in a subset of metastatic melanoma patients with LMD...|$|R
