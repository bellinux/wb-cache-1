5|$|Hughes {{was killed}} in action {{on the evening of}} 7September 1940, after he intercepted a Dornier Do17 bomber taking part in a {{large-scale}} attack on London. His Spitfire crashed in a field between Sundridge and Bessels Green in Kent. He apparently bailed out, but his parachute failed to open; his body was found in a garden on Main Road, Sundridge, not far from the wreck of his Spitfire. The Dornier <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the River Darent. No.234 Squadron lost its commanding officer, O'Brien, in the same action. Mystery surrounds exactly how Hughes came to grief, though his close-in tactics are believed to have played a major part in it. The strain of regular combat without respite, manifesting itself in fatigue and spots before the eyes, may also have contributed. He is generally thought to have collided with flying wreckage from the crippled German bomber, rendering his Spitfire uncontrollable. It is also possible that Hughes accidentally rammed his target. Further speculation suggested that he was the victim of friendly fire from another British fighter attacking the same Dornier, or was struck by German bullets from a Bf109. Some observers on the ground, including collier Charles Hall, maintained that Hughes rammed the Dornier on purpose. Four days after his death, No.234 Squadron was moved back to the relative quiet of Cornwall.|$|E
5|$|Non-intervention, {{and with}} it the Non-Intervention Agreement, had been {{proposed}} in a joint diplomatic initiative by the governments of France and the United Kingdom, in order to prevent the war from escalating into a major pan-European conflict. On 4 August 1936, non-intervention was put to Nazi Germany by the French. The German position was that such a declaration was not needed, but discussions could be held on preventing the spread of the war to the rest of Europe, so long as the USSR was present. It was mentioned at that meeting that Germany was already supplying the Nationalists. On 9 August, the Germans informed the British that 'no war materials had been sent from Germany and none will', which was blatantly false. One German Junker aircraft was captured when it <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> Republican territory. Its release would be required before Germany signed the Non-Intervention Pact. There was a growing belief that countries would not abide by the agreement anyway. Admiral Erich Raeder urged the German government to either back the Nationalists more completely, and bring Europe to the brink of war, or abandon them. On the 24th, Germany signed. It was at this point that the Non-Intervention Committee was created to uphold the agreement, but the double-dealing of the USSR and Germany had already become apparent. Germany consistently broke the agreement they had signed.|$|E
5|$|On 7 August 1936, France {{unilaterally}} declared non-intervention. Draft declarations {{had been}} put to the German and Italian governments. Such a declaration had already been accepted by the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Poland, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, which renounced all traffic in war material, direct or indirect. The Portuguese Foreign Minister, Armindo Monteiro, was also asked to accept, but held his hand. An ultimatum was put to Yvon Delbos by the British: halt French exports to Spain, or Britain would not be obliged to act under the Treaty of Locarno if Germany invaded; on 9 August, exports were duly suspended. However, collections for food, clothing and medical supplies to the Spanish Republicans continued. On 9 August, the Germans informed the British that 'no war materials had been sent from Germany and none will', which was blatantly false. During the blockade of the Strait of Gibraltar by the Spanish Republican Navy one German Junkers was captured when it <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> Republican territory, and explained as 'merely a transport aircraft'. Its release would be required before Germany signed the Non-Intervention Pact. Portugal accepted the pact on 13 August, unless her border was threatened by the war.|$|E

Another rule implemented by Cook was his prohibition of the consumption of salt fat skimmed from the ship's copper boiling pans, then a common practice in the Navy. In contact with air the copper formed compounds that prevented the absorption of vitamins by the intestines.|$|E

25|$|Legislative {{action was}} also {{undertaken}} by Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), John Conyers Jr., Clement Leroy Otter (R-ID) and Ron Paul. They proposed {{an amendment to}} the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Bill of 2005 which would cut off funding to the Department of Justice for searches conducted under section 215. The amendment initially failed to pass the House with a tie vote, 210210. Although the original vote <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> favor of the amendment, the vote was held open and several House members were persuaded to change their votes. However, on June 15, 2005 they made a second attempt to limit section 215 searches in an amendment to another House appropriations bill and this time it passed with a vote of 238-187 in favor of the Sanders amendment.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the start}} of World War I, Moon soon enlisted in the Royal Naval Air Service with the rank of Flight Sub-Lieutenant. His {{military}} service took him to East Africa, based on HMS Hyacinth, from where on 6 January 1917 {{he was on a}} reconnaissance flight with Cdr. Richard Bridgeman as observer. They were forced to land with engine trouble and <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> a creek of the Rufiji River delta where they destroyed the seaplane to avoid the possibility of its being captured by the enemy. They then spent three days wandering in the delta trying to avoid capture and to rejoin their ship. During this time they had little or nothing to eat, and were continually obliged to swim across the creeks, the bush on the banks being impenetrable.|$|E
25|$|Around an hour later, the Zeppelin drifted {{low over}} the island, and Dutch units on the ground opened fire on her. The Netherlands was a neutral country and Dutch forces had {{standing}} orders to fire on overflying, foreign aircraft. A south wind blew the L 19 offshore and, some time during the night of 1–2 February, the Zeppelin <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the North Sea. Loewe dropped a bottle into the sea, with a report on his situation and with letters to his family; this was found {{a few weeks later}} by a yacht near Gothenburg, Sweden. The German Navy put ships to sea that night to search for the L 19, but they only discovered one of her fuel-tanks, still containing fuel. This was likely dropped as a desperate measure to save weight and remain aloft.|$|E

25|$|After the Berlin Wall <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> November 1989, {{the first}} broken links were re-established, with Friedrichstraße on 1 July 1990, as the first. The BVG and DR jointly marketed the {{services}} {{soon after the}} reunification. Administratively, the divided S-Bahn networks remained separate {{in this time of}} momentous changes, encompassing German reunification and reunification of Berlin into a single city, although the dividing line was no longer the former Berlin Wall. DR and BVG (of the whole of reunified Berlin from 1 January 1992, after absorbing BVB of East Berlin) operated individual lines end to end, both into the other party's territories. For example, S2 was all BVG even after it was extended northward and southward into Brandenburg/former East German territory. The main east-west route (Stadtbahn) was a joint operation. Individual trains were operated by either BVG or DR end-to-end on the same tracks. This arrangement ended on 1 January 1994, with the creation of Deutsche Bahn due to the merger between DR and the former West Germany's Deutsche Bundesbahn. All S-Bahn operations in Berlin were transferred to the newly formed S-Bahn Berlin GmbH as a subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn, and the BVG withdrew from running S-Bahn services.|$|E
25|$|In {{the time}} {{starting}} from 1933 also the Holy Cross parish was under suppression by the National Socialists ("Nazis") and from 1939 has also lost fold {{members in the}} Second World War. The church was used because of its exposed position {{as a point of}} reference for the navigation of the bombers of the USAAF and the RAF. The windows at {{the west side of the}} church were destroyed on 4 October 1943 by parts of an attack, which should meet the water works near the cemetery of Bornheim. During the first large-scale attack on Frankfurt in the evening of the same day also the windows of the eastern side and the parsonage building were destroyed by a bomb row, which <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the garden plots at the Bornheimer Hang. With the next large attack on the city on 29 January 1944 parsonage building was heavily met. At the night from the 18. to the 19. March 1944 the church was hit by several incendiary bombs, which pierced the roof timberwork. The bombs could extinguished inside the church. On 11 December 1944 the church was hit by three bombs, which tore the large outside staircase at the west side of the steeple and the auxiliary chapel in the steeple hall. Now a large hole was into the west side of the nave. The services had to be held thereafter in the heating plant room underneath the steeple.|$|E
