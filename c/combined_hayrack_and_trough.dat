The longitudinal and magnetic local time variations of the CHAMP Δ Ne in the Northern (left) and Southern (right) Hemispheres are shown in Fig.  1. In observations, there exist a wave- 2 structure (one peak <b>and</b> <b>trough</b> over NA (180 ^∘W- 0 ^∘), another peak <b>and</b> <b>trough</b> over the Europe-Asia sector (0 ^∘- 180 ^∘E) in the Northern Hemisphere), and a wave- 1 structure (one peak <b>and</b> <b>trough)</b> in the Southern Hemisphere. Both peaks <b>and</b> <b>troughs</b> shift eastward as the local time increases. The wave amplitudes are larger in the Southern than in the Northern Hemisphere. Wang et al.

Wang and Liu (2015) indicated that local physical processes (i.e., thermospheric neutral wind and solar heating) contributed to the observed longitudinal structure of the Ne.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} the intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction {{achieved by the}} most frequently prescribed glaucoma drugs and a placebo in a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials. DESIGN: Meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-seven articles reporting on 28 randomized clinical trials. These articles reported 6953 participants for the <b>trough</b> <b>and</b> 6841 for the peak. METHODS: Articles published up to December 2003 were identified in the following data sources: Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and references from relevant articles. Over 85 % of the patients had to be diagnosed with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension (OH), and articles had to be written in English, German, French, or Dutch. Quality of trials was assessed by a Delphi list with additions. The pooled 1 -month IOP-lowering effect from baseline at peak <b>and</b> <b>trough</b> was calculated by performing meta-analysis using the random effects model. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Absolute and relative change in IOP from baseline, for peak <b>and</b> <b>trough</b> moments. RESULTS: Relative IOP reductions from baseline [mean (95 % confidence interval) ] were - 23 % (- 25 % to - 22 %) for a peak and - 20 % (- 23 % to - 17 %) for a trough for 0. 5 % betaxolol; peak, - 27 % (- 29 % to - 25 %), <b>and</b> <b>trough,</b> - 26 % (- 28 % to - 25 %), for 0. 5 % timolol; peak, - 22 % (- 24 % to - 20 %), <b>and</b> <b>trough,</b> - 17 % (- 19 % to - 15 %), for 2. 0 % dorzolamide; peak, - 17 % (- 19 % to - 15 %), <b>and</b> <b>trough,</b> - 17 % (- 19 % to - 15 %) for 1. 0 % brinzolamide; peak, - 25 % (- 28 % to - 22 %), <b>and</b> <b>trough,</b> - 18 % (- 21 % to - 14 %) for 0. 2 % brimonidine; peak, - 31 % (- 33 % to - 29 %), <b>and</b> <b>trough,</b> - 28 % (- 30 % to - 26 %) for 0. 005 % latanoprost; peak, - 31 % (- 32 % to - 29 %), <b>and</b> <b>trough,</b> - 29 % (- 32 % to - 25 %) for 0. 004 % travoprost; peak, - 33 % (- 35 % to - 31 %), <b>and</b> <b>trough,</b> - 28 % (- 29 % to - 27 %) for 0. 03 % bimatoprost; and peak, - 5 % (- 9 % to - 1 %), <b>and</b> <b>trough,</b> - 5 % (- 10 % to - 0 %) for the placebo. The difference in absolute IOP reduction from baseline between timolol and prostaglandin analogs or prostamide varied from - 0. 4 to 0. 1 mmHg at <b>trough</b> <b>and</b> from 1. 0 to 1. 5 mmHg at peak. Quality scores of included studies were generally high, a mean of 14. 2 {{on a scale from}} 0 to 20 (interquartile range, 13 - 16). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests that bimatoprost, travoprost, latanoprost, and timolol are the most effective intraocular pressure-reducing agents in POAG and OH patients. status: publishe...|$|R

The new pre-WWI chronology alters more than 40 % of the peak <b>and</b> <b>troughs,</b> <b>and</b> removes cycles long considered the most questionable. An important implication of the new chronology is the lack of discernible differences in the frequency and duration of industrial cycles among the pre-Civil War, Civil War to WWI, and post-WWII periods. Of course, my comparison between pre-WWI and post-WWII cycles is limited by its reliance on a single annual index (as opposed to many monthly series) that is less comprehensive than GDP. ...|$|R
