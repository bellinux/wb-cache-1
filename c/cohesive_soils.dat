40|$|Graduation date: 1991 Forest soils {{with low}} bulk densities are often {{considered}} {{less susceptible to}} compaction than soils with higher bulk densities. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine if soil strength controlled the compression of soils with low bulk density. Four soils were selected for this evaluation. Three of these were andic soils with low bulk density and the fourth soil was a more dense, <b>cohesive</b> <b>soil.</b> Undisturbed samples of saturated and partly saturated soil were compressed in a one-dimensional consolidation test apparatus. Measurements with separate samples were at one of 7 normal stresses between 0. 033 and 1. 96 MPa. Shear strength of saturated soil was measured in direct shear tests. Primary consolidation of saturated soil was completed in less than one minute at all normal stresses. Shear stress and bulk density increased continuously during shear strain. The compression index of the <b>cohesive</b> <b>soil</b> was significantly larger (p< 0. 05) than that of the andic soils. The shear strength of andic soils (average cohesion intercept of 0. 016 MPa and friction angle of 33. 3 °) was significantly higher (p< 0. 05) than the <b>cohesive</b> <b>soil</b> (cohesion intercept of 0. 028 MPa and friction angle of 28. 9 °). When saturated, the <b>cohesive</b> <b>soil</b> was more compressible than the andic soils because of lower soil strength. A nonlinear model of soil compression was developed that accurately predicted the compressed density of saturated and partly saturated soil as a function of normal stress, initial bulk density of undisturbed samples, and degree of saturation. As degree of saturation decreased, the compressibility of the <b>cohesive</b> <b>soil</b> decreased more rapidly than it did for the andic soils. As a result, bulk density of dry <b>cohesive</b> <b>soil</b> increased less than it did for dry andic soils. Differences in the compressibility of soils were attributed to texture and clay mineralogy. The differences in the compressibility of these soils were much smaller than were the differences in bulk density. Decreasing water content affected the compressibility of the <b>cohesive</b> <b>soil</b> more than it affected the andic soils. Because soil strength controls the compressibility of these forest soils regardless of bulk density, it will also determine the susceptibility of soils to compaction by machines...|$|R

Larger lateral load dissipation can be achieved by passive soil forces or raked piles.Due to the relatively small diameter of TRM piles, buckling of the pile shaft must be considered in soft soil conditions with SPT values of less than 2, a buckling check is required. In <b>cohesive</b> <b>soils</b> with an un-drained shear strength with Cu<15kPa buckling needs to be investigated. In non-cohesive soils it can be assumed that lateral support provided by embedment in generally adequate.

50|$|Porosity gives {{a measure}} of the water storage {{capability}} of soil but not all the water present in the soil pores is available for extraction by pumping for the use of humans or draining by gravity. The pores in the soil hold back sufficient quantity of water on account of forces like surface tension and molecular attraction. Hence the actual amount of water that can be extracted from the unit volume of aquifer by pumping or under the action of gravity is called as specific yield. The fraction of water held back in the aquifer is known as specific retention. Thus {{it can be said that}} porosity is the sum of specific yield and specific retention. Specific yield of soils differ from each other in the sense that some soil types have strong molecular attraction with the water held in their pores while others have less. It is found experimentally that cohessionless soils have high specific yield than <b>cohesive</b> <b>soils</b> because the former has significantly less molecular attraction then the latter. Coarse-grained soils or rocks such as coarse sandstone can have specific yields that are closer to their actual porosity in the range 20 to 35%.

5000|$|At {{any point}} {{above the water}} table, in the vadose zone, the {{effective}} stress is approximately equal to the total stress, as proven by Terzaghi's principle. Realistically, the effective stress {{is greater than the}} total stress, as the pore water pressure in these partially saturated soils is actually negative. This is primarily due to the surface tension of pore water in voids throughout the vadose zone causing a suction effect on surrounding particles. This capillary action is the [...] "upward movement of water through the vadose zone" [...] (Coduto, 266). Capillary effects in soil are more complex than in free water due to the randomly connected void space and particle interference through which to flow; regardless, the height of this zone of capillary rise, where negative pore water pressure is generally peaks, can be closely approximated by a simple equation. The height of capillary rise is inversely proportional to the diameter of void space in contact with water. Therefore, the smaller the void space, the higher water will rise due to tension forces. Sandy soils consist of more coarse material with more room for voids, and therefore tends to have a much shallower capillary zone than do more <b>cohesive</b> <b>soils,</b> such as clays and silts.|$|E
50|$|A river bank can {{be divided}} into three zones: Toe zone, bank zone, and overbank area. The toe zone is the area which is most {{susceptible}} to erosion. Because it is located in between the ordinary water level and the low water level, it is strongly affected by currents and erosional events. The bank zone is above the ordinary high water level, but can still be effected periodically by currents, and gets the most human and animal traffic. The overbank area is inland of both the toe and bank zones, and can be classified as either a floodplain or a bluff, depending on its slope. A river bank will respond to erosional activity based on the characteristics of the bank material. The most common type of bank is a stratified or interstratified bank, which consists of cohesionless layers interbedded with cohesive layers. If the cohesive soil is at the toe of the bank, it will control the retreat rate of the overlying layer. If the cohesionless soil is at the toe of the bank, these layers are not protected by the layers of cohesive soil. A Bedrock bank is usually very stable and will experience gradual erosion. A cohesive bank is highly susceptible to erosion in times of lowering water levels due to its low permeability.
