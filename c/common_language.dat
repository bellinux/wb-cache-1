5|$|The Republic of India has {{hundreds}} of languages. During the British Raj, English was the official language. When the Indian Independence Movement gained {{momentum in the}} early part of the 20th century, efforts were undertaken to make Hindustani as a <b>common</b> <b>language</b> to unite various linguistic groups against the British Government. As early as 1918, Mahatma Gandhi established the Dakshin Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha (Institution for the Propagation of Hindi in South India). In 1925, the Indian National Congress switched to Hindustani from English for conducting its proceedings. Both Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru were supporters of Hindustani and Congress wanted to propagate the learning of Hindustani in non-Hindi speaking Provinces of India. The idea of making Hindustani or Hindi the <b>common</b> <b>language,</b> was not acceptable to Periyar, who viewed it as an attempt to make Tamils subordinate to North Indians.|$|E
5|$|Aramaic {{became the}} <b>common</b> <b>language</b> in the north, in Galilee and Samaria. Hebrew {{remained}} {{in use in}} Judah; however the returning exiles brought back Aramaic influence, and Aramaic was used for communicating with other ethnic groups during the Persian period. Alexander conquered Judah in 332BCE, beginning the period of Hellenistic (Greek) domination. During the Hellenistic period Judea became independent under the Hasmonean dynasty, but later the Romans ended their independence, making Herod the Great their governor. One Jewish revolt against the Romans led {{to the destruction of}} the Second Temple in 70CE, and the second Bar Kokhba revolt in 132–135 led to a large departure of the Jewish population of Judea.|$|E

5|$|Early in his reign, Justinian {{appointed}} the quaestor Tribonian to oversee this task. The {{first draft of}} the Codex Iustinianus, a codification of imperial constitutions from the 2nd century onward, was issued on 7 April 529. (The final version appeared in 534.) It {{was followed by the}} Digesta (or Pandectae), a compilation of older legal texts, in 533, and by the Institutiones, a textbook explaining the principles of law.

5|$|Koine Greek {{had become}} the <b>common</b> <b>language</b> of the eastern Mediterranean and into Asia Minor after the conquests of Alexander the Great.

5|$|A <b>common</b> <b>language</b> {{may have}} been seen {{to serve as the}} basis of a nation, but as {{contemporary}} historians of 19th-century Germany noted, it took more than linguistic similarity to unify these several hundred polities. The experience of German-speaking Central Europe during the years of French hegemony contributed to a sense of common cause to remove the French invaders and reassert control over their own lands. The exigencies of Napoleon's campaigns in Poland (1806–07), the Iberian Peninsula, western Germany, and his disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812 disillusioned many Germans, princes and peasants alike. Napoleon's Continental System nearly ruined the Central European economy. The invasion of Russia included nearly 125,000 troops from German lands, and the loss of that army encouraged many Germans, both high- and low-born, to envision a Central Europe free of Napoleon's influence. The creation of student militias such as the Lützow Free Corps exemplified this tendency.|$|E
