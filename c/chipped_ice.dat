40|$|Summer {{deterioration}} {{of snow and}} ice surfaces due to high solar radiation and near melting temperatures hampers the year-round use of natural ice islands and smooth sea-ice areas in the Arctic Ocean, and permanent snow and ice areas in the Antarctic. Use of snow or <b>chipped</b> <b>ice</b> on ice surfaces in the Antarctic has generally provided sufficient protection to prevent deterioration and ablation, but the warmer environment of the arctic summer often precludes use of these natural materials. Sawdust has been used successfully in the California Sierras for protecting compacted-snow areas during periods of alternating above-and below-freezing temperatures and high solar radiation, but its scarcity and shipping bulk preclude its use in polar areas. Polyurethane foam has proven even more successful than sawdust as a protective covering in laboratory tests during alternating abov,e-and below-freezing temperatures and simulated solar radiation.

40|$|Preliminary {{results with}} a greatly {{simplified}} continuous perfusion system indicated that satisfactory preservations of canine kidneys {{could be achieved}} in a small circuit from which much of the complexity required for pH, temperature, and pulse pressure control in conventional systems had been eliminated. Further development has been undertaken to simplify the pump control unit and to compare materials suitable for construction of the definitive circuit. Reliability of mechanical components and of preservation quality have been studied {{in a series of}} 48 hour perfusions of canine kidneys, with the use of both cryoprecipitated plasma and a five percent albumin solution as perfusates. Perfusions were carried out at both very low (0. 5 °C.) and low (5 °C.) temperatures, since the operating temperature of the circuit, when immersed in <b>chipped</b> <b>ice</b> for simplified temperature control, depended on the material used in its construction. A total of 2, 424 hours of perfusion was carried out, and no mechanical failure occurred; all components functioned efficiently and reliably. Plasma proved to be unsuitable at these low temperatures; only two of six dogs survived after 48 hours perfusion at 0. 5 °C. and six of nine survived at 5 °C. All kidneys perfused with albumin at both temperatures survived, with maximum serum creatinines of 6. 3 and 4. 9 mg. percent, respectively, demonstrating that this solution is the more satisfactory of the two perfusates for this system...|$|E

30|$|There {{has been}} no {{long-term}} comprehensive in situ monitoring of snow/glacial melt contributing to the knowledge of hydrology in the river basins of the Himalayan region. As a result, studies on snow melt/glacial melt that describe a basin’s hydrology lack direct evidence and sometimes appear to be inconsistent (Armstrong 2010; Kaser et al. 2010). Most of the upper parts of the Brahmaputra catchment is covered by Himalayan snow and have major effect on the downstream flow characteristics of the river. Apart from temperature, other climatic factors such as heavy precipitation, wind speed etc. also effect on melting of snow. The effect of wind {{is important for the}} melting process of snow or <b>chipped</b> <b>ice</b> (Hasebe and Kumekawa 1994). According to the result of the laboratory experiment, performed by Hasebe and Kumekawa (1994), the relation between the ratio volume of snowmelt water to air temperature and wind speed is nearly linear. They also found that peak discharge is sharp as the wind speed increases and lag time from the beginning of snowmelt runoff to peak discharge is faster according to an increase in wind speed. Rainfall on existing snow cover frequently occurs in spring. At the onset of a rain storm, the snow cover often stores a portion of the rain and consequently attenuates runoff formation. However if the rain persists and the snow cover becomes saturated, any additional melt water will increase runoff formation.|$|E
