[...] "There it remained frozen, for nearly another hundred years", until mathematicians such as Fisher provided [...] "both models and status", enabling evolutionary biologists to construct the modern synthesis of the 1930s and 1940s. That made biology a professional science, at the price of ejecting the notion of progress. That, Ruse argues, was a significant cost to [...] "people [...] still firmly committed to Progress" [...] as a philosophy.|$|E

But she explained her fears about staying in Greenwich Village, saying I would sit there (in a gay bar) in the evenings thinking, 'What if (a police raid) happens tonight and I get hauled off to the slam with all these other women?'
