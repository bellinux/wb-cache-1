Explicitly, the computation of a smallest enclosing cylinder in E^ 3 {{is reduced to}} the computation of a smallest <b>circumscribing</b> cylinder. We improve existing polynomial formulations to compute the locally extreme <b>circumscribing</b> cylinders in ^ 3 and exhibit subclasses of simplices where the algebraic degrees can be further reduced.

The genus was not in Donk's original family concept, which included only Bankera and Phellodon, genera whose species produce hyaline (translucent), and ornamented spores. Donk left Hydnellum in the tribe Hydnelleae of the family Thelephoraceae, along with Sarcodon and Hydnodon. In 1981, however, Walter Jülich emended Donk's concept of the Bankeraceae, adding hydnoid genera that produced brown, lobed spores—Hydnellum and Sarcodon.|$|E

Karsten defined Hydnellum as having fruitbodies with a corky or leathery, tough cap, and a {{centrally}} attached stipe. Synonyms of Hydnellum include Calodon (Karsten, 1881), and Phaeodon (Joseph Schröter, 1888).|$|E
5|$|Hygrophoropsis was {{originally}} <b>circumscribed</b> in 1888 by German mycologist Joseph Schröter as a subgenus of Cantharellus. It contained a single species, the widespread H.aurantiaca, {{commonly known as}} the false chanterelle. German naturalist Bernhard Studer-Steinhäuslin concluded in 1900 that the fungus was more appropriately placed in the genus Clitocybe, based on its white spores, decurrent gills, and lack of a ring on the stipe. This classification was adopted in the early writings of influential mycologist Rolf Singer, who in 1943 proposed that Hygrophoropsis should be a subgenus of Clitocybe.|$|E

In a more recent (2008) cladistic analysis, Mycenastrum was {{shown to be a}} sister group to the Lycoperdaceae; authors Larsson and Jeppson agreed with Zeller (1949) and Pilat's (1958) decision to regard Mycenastrium as a monotypic genus in the separate family Mycenastraceae. Despite this, several taxonomic authorities prefer to fold Mycenastraceae into the Agaricaceae.|$|E
