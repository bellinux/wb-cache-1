Stella the skunk {{is available in}} this game mode, alongside the three playable characters from the main game. Players navigate a maze to collect food before the timer runs out. The player with the most food wins the game. A most of five pieces of food can be carried at once, these must be carried to a <b>collection</b> <b>area</b> before more food can be picked up.|$|E

The nantenna is one proposed development which would overcome this limitation by making use of the abundant natural radiation (such as solar radiation).|$|E

25|$|Locating a {{tower at}} high latitudes could produce up to 85 per {{cent of the}} output of a similar plant located closer to the equator, if the <b>collection</b> <b>area</b> is sloped {{significantly}} toward the equator. The sloped collector field, which also functions as a chimney, is built on suitable mountainsides, with a short vertical chimney on the mountaintop to accommodate the vertical axis air turbine. The results showed that solar chimney power plants at high latitudes may have satisfactory thermal performance.|$|E
25|$|Much {{wood fuel}} comes from native forests around the world. Plantation wood is rarely used for firewood, {{as it is}} more {{valuable}} as timber or wood pulp, however, some wood fuel is gathered from trees planted amongst crops, also known as agroforestry. The collection or harvesting of this wood can have serious environmental implications for the <b>collection</b> <b>area.</b> The concerns are often specific to the particular area, but can include all the problems that regular logging create. The heavy removal of wood from forests can cause habitat destruction and soil erosion.|$|E
25|$|Particulate contaminants, {{including}} pollen, dust, fibers, and soot, may affix {{to objects}} after entering collection areas through poorly maintained ventilation systems. Individuals {{passing through a}} <b>collection</b> <b>area</b> may also have particulates embedded on their clothing or bodies, which can become dislodged thereby becoming an airborne contaminant. Construction or maintenance efforts are another common cause of particulate pollution. Particulates which adhere to collection objects may cause soiling or blemishing, requiring mechanical removal and conservation efforts. These pollutants can be minimized via high quality HVAC systems, regularly replaced filters for vents, and careful placement of objects away from high-risk areas such as designated smoking sections, construction sites, and high-traffic areas such as entryways.|$|E

40|$|The use of ETBE (ethyl-tert-butylether) as {{gasoline}} additive {{has recently}} grown rapidly. Contamination of aquatic systems {{is well documented}} for MTBE (methyl-tert-butylether), but less for other gasoline additives. Due to their mobility they may easily reach drinking water <b>collection</b> <b>areas.</b> Odour and flavour thresholds of MTBE {{are known to be}} low, but for ETBE and TAME (methyl-tert-amylether) hardly information is available. The objective here is to determine these thresholds for MTBE, ETBE and TAME. and relate these to concentrations monitored in thousands of samples from Dutch drinking water <b>collection</b> <b>areas.</b> For ETBE odour and flavour thresholds are low with 1 - 2 mu g L- 1, for MTBE and TAME they range from 7 to 16 mu g L- 1. In most groundwater <b>collection</b> <b>areas</b> MTBE concentrations are below 0. 1 mu g L- 1. In phreatic groundwaters in sandy soils not covered by a protective soil layer, occasionally MTBE occurs at higher concentrations. For surface water <b>collection</b> <b>areas</b> a minority of the locations is free of MTBE. For river bank and dune infiltrates, at a few locations the odour and flavour threshold is exceeded. For ETBE fewer monitoring data are available. ETBE was found in 2 out of 37 groundwater <b>collection</b> <b>areas,</b> in concentrations below 1 mu g L- 1. In the surface water <b>collection</b> <b>areas</b> monitored ETBE was found in concentrations near to the odour and flavour thresholds. The low odour and flavour thresholds combined with the high mobility and persistence of these compounds, their high production volumes and their increased use may yield problems with future production of drinking water...|$|R
25|$|Sulfur dioxide (SO2), {{nitrogen}} dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3) {{are some of}} the most common types of gaseous pollutants found within collections and can result in the catalyzation of deletrious chemical reactions. The chemical reactions caused by these gases can result in the breakdown of inorganic and organic materials, or the tarnishing of metal objects. Other objects contain intrinsic elements that may begin to break down over time causing a damaging condition known as off-gassing. The storage of construction materials and basic housekeeping within a <b>collection</b> <b>area</b> may also be a source of gaseous pollutants. The hazardous fumes given off by strong cleaning products such as bleach or ammonia can transfer to objects causing deterioration, and construction materials such as adhesives, paints, and sealants may off-gas resulting in additional damages.|$|E
25|$|The tree {{maintained}} its {{connection with the}} dairy industry through the mid-20th century, serving as a collection point for dairy farmers bringing cans of cream to be loaded and transported by road to Gladstone when the first motorised truck began carting cream from Miriam Vale to the Port Curtis Dairy Factory in 1952. By this year a ramp, facing Blomfield Street, had been built alongside {{the trunk of the}} Big Fig for the loading of cream and later milk cans onto the back of delivery vehicles. The place served as an easily accessible and shady location for farmers to assemble and wait for their produce to be loaded. During the 1960s, the original loading ramp was replaced with a new ramp, and an early fence and gates, reputedly constructed around the tree and cream/milk <b>collection</b> <b>area</b> by Queensland Railways, was demolished. The new ramp was built facing Station Street, and remained until at least 1977 when the last contract for the milk run to Gladstone was cancelled. Several small earth mounds {{to the north of the}} trunk of the Fig Tree are all that remain of the second ramp.|$|E

Individual still designs include single-slope, double-slope (or greenhouse type), vertical, conical, inverted absorber, multi-wick, and multiple effect.

Double-slope stills are the most economical for decentralized domestic purposes, while active multiple effect units are more suitable for large-scale applications.|$|E

2500|$|The {{design of}} some bank barns called a [...] "High-Drive Bank Barn" [...] allowed for wagons to enter {{directly}} into the hay loft making unloading the hay easier. Sometimes the high-drive was accessed by an earthen or wood ramp and sometimes the ramp was covered like a bridge {{to make it more}} durable. In the Pennsylvania Barns the animals were housed in the basement level. In many other bank barns the tie-ups were on the upper-ground level and below the stables a basement usually acted as a manure <b>collection</b> <b>area.</b> Many bank barns simply have a small incline leading up to the loft area as opposed to a ramp. Some bank barns are constructed directly into existing hillsides while others are fitted with built up earthen and stone areas to create the trademark bank. The design is similar to English barns except for bank and basement aspects. The basement space could be utilized for animals while the area above, easily accessed by wagon because of the bank, could be used for feed and grain storage. Bank barns {{can be thought of as}} English barns raised up on an exposed full basement.|$|E
