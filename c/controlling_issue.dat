40|$|In Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Supreme Court decided {{important}} questions of structural constitutionalism on the assumption, {{shared by all}} of the parties, that members of the Securities and Exchange Commission are not removable at will by the president. Four Justices strongly challenged the majority 2 ̆ 7 s willingness to accept what amounts to a stipulation by the parties to a <b>controlling</b> <b>issue</b> of law. As a general matter the American legal system does not allow parties to stipulate to legal conclusions, though it welcomes and encourages stipulations to matters of fact. I argue that one ought to take seriously the idea that stipulations of law should be as integral a part of the adjudicative process as stipulations of fact-or, at the minimum, that the acceptance of stipulations of law rests on defensible assumptions about the nature of adjudication as a mechanism for resolving disputes rather than as a mechanism for declaring the law or expressing public values. Objections to the wide use of legal stipulations often focus on the potential third-party effects of adjudication, primarily (though not exclusively) through precedent. Those objections generally assume a contestable theory of precedent that emanates from a law-declaring rather than a dispute-resolving theory of adjudication. It is quite possible for a theory of precedent to accompany a dispute-resolution model of adjudication without raising (undue) concerns about externalities in accepting legal stipulations. Thus, the legal system should consider extending the degree to which it enables parties to control the legal issues decided by courts...|$|E

In this paper we discuss discretionary access <b>control</b> <b>issues</b> in object-oriented databases. Our objective is two-fold. One objective is to survey {{the state of the art}} in access control concepts and mechanisms as reported in the relevant literature. To do this, we develop a framework to categorize access <b>control</b> <b>issues.</b> The categories include subject to object, inter-object, and intra-object access control. We cover structural and behavioral approaches to access control. Another objective is to identify several research directions and access <b>control</b> <b>issues</b> that are beyond the scope of existing mechanisms. These include authorizations based on separation of duties and multiple approvals, the incorporation of t [...] ...|$|R
