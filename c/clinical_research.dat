40|$|Aims:  This article {{presents}} {{a proposal for}} the <b>Clinical</b> Nurse <b>Research</b> Consultant, a new nursing role. Background:  Although healthcare delivery continues to evolve, nursing has lacked highly specialized <b>clinical</b> and <b>research</b> leadership that, as a primary responsibility, drives evidence-based practice change in collaboration with bedside clinicians. Data sources:   International literature published over the last 25 years in the databases of CINAHL, OVID, Medline Pubmed, Science Direct, Expanded Academic, ESBSCOhost, Scopus and Proquest is cited to create a case for the <b>Clinical</b> Nurse <b>Research</b> Consultant. Discussion:  The <b>Clinical</b> Nurse <b>Research</b> Consultant will address the research/practice gap and assist in facilitating evidence-based clinical practice. To fulfil the responsibilities of this proposed role, the <b>Clinical</b> Nurse <b>Research</b> Consultant must be a doctorally prepared recognized clinical expert, have educational expertise, and possess advanced interpersonal, teamwork and communication skills. This role will enable clinical nurses to maintain and share their clinical expertise, advance practice through research and role model the clinical/research nexus. Implications for nursing:   Critically, the <b>Clinical</b> Nurse <b>Research</b> Consultant must be appointed in a clinical and academic partnership to provide for career progression and role support. Conclusion:  The creation of the <b>Clinical</b> Nurse <b>Research</b> Consultant will advance nursing practice and the discipline of nursing. <br /...|$|R

5|$|LTP was {{discovered}} in the rabbit hippocampus by Terje Lømo in 1966 and has remained a popular subject of research since. Many modern LTP studies seek to better understand its basic biology, while others aim to draw a causal link between LTP and behavioral learning. Still others try to develop methods, pharmacologic or otherwise, of enhancing LTP to improve learning and memory. LTP is also a subject of <b>clinical</b> <b>research,</b> for example, {{in the areas of}} Alzheimer's disease and addiction medicine.|$|E

5|$|Four {{years after}} the New York Court of Appeals opened the doors for {{physicians}} to prescribe contraceptives, Sanger opened a second birth control clinic, which she staffed with physicians to make it legal under that court ruling (the first clinic had employed nurses). This second clinic, the <b>Clinical</b> <b>Research</b> Bureau (CRB), opened on January 2, 1923. To avoid police harassment the clinic's existence was not publicized, its primary mission was stated to be conducting scientific research, and it only provided services to married women. The existence of the clinic was finally announced {{to the public in}} December 1923, but this time there were no arrests or controversy. This convinced activists that, after ten years of struggle, birth control had finally become widely accepted in the United States. The CRB was the first legal birth control clinic in the United States, and quickly grew into the world's leading contraceptive research center.|$|E
5|$|One area of <b>clinical</b> <b>research</b> {{is focused}} on {{treating}} the underlying disease pathology. Reduction of beta-amyloid levels is a common target of compounds (such as apomorphine) under investigation. Immunotherapy or vaccination for the amyloid protein is one treatment modality under study. Unlike preventative vaccination, the putative therapy {{would be used to}} treat people already diagnosed. It is based upon the concept of training the immune system to recognise, attack, and reverse deposition of amyloid, thereby altering the course of the disease. An example of such a vaccine under investigation was ACC-001, although the trials were suspended in 2008. Another similar agent is bapineuzumab, an antibody designed as identical to the naturally induced anti-amyloid antibody. However, immunotherapeutic agents have been found to cause some concerning adverse drug reactions, such as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Other approaches are neuroprotective agents, such as AL-108, and metal-protein interaction attenuation agents, such as PBT2. A TNFα receptor-blocking fusion protein, etanercept has showed encouraging results.|$|E
5|$|Research is a {{priority}} in terms of improving women's health. Research needs include diseases unique to women, more serious in women and those that differ in risk factors between women and men. The balance of gender in research studies needs to be balanced appropriately to allow analysis that will detect interactions between gender and other factors. Gronowski and Schindler suggest that scientific journals make documentation of gender a requirement when reporting the results of animal studies, and that funding agencies require justification from investigators for any gender inequity in their grant proposals, giving preference to those that are inclusive. They also suggest it {{is the role of}} health organisations to encourage women to enroll in <b>clinical</b> <b>research.</b> However, there has been progress in terms of large scale studies such as the WHI, and in 2006 the Society for Women's Health Research founded the Organization for the Study of Sex Differences (OSSD) and the journal Biology of Sex Differences to further the study of sex differences.|$|E

This article suggests the concepts of acupuncture behind <b>clinical</b> <b>researches</b> by reviewing the <b>clinical</b> <b>researches</b> done, analyzing the existing problems, and integrating real life acupuncture into the research process.

40|$|The <b>clinical</b> <b>researches</b> of immune {{response}} usually generate {{a huge amount}} of biomedical testing data over a certain period of time. The user-friendly data management systems based on the relational database will help immunologists/clinicians to fully manage the data. On the other hand, the same biological assays such as ELISPOT and flow cytometric assays are involved in immunological experiments no matter of different study purposes. The reuse of biological knowledge is one of driving forces behind this ontology-driven data management. Therefore, an ontology-driven database will help to handle different <b>clinical</b> immune <b>researches</b> and help immunologists/clinicians easily understand the immunological data from each other. We will discuss some outlines for building an ontology-driven data management for <b>clinical</b> immune <b>researches</b> (ODMim) ...|$|R

5|$|While {{working for}} the Rockefeller Institute, in 1931 Rhoads was invited by {{hematologist}} William B. Castle to join his Rockefeller Anemia Commission, to conduct <b>clinical</b> <b>research</b> at Presbyterian Hospital in San Juan, Puerto Rico. This {{was part of the}} Rockefeller Foundation's sanitary commission on the island through the International Health Division. Castle's research interest was pernicious iron deficiency anemia, specifically as caused by the parasitic hookworm, which was endemic on the island at rates of 80%, and tropical sprue. An effective treatment for the latter had just been developed, although the disease's causes remained obscure. As recently as 2010, medical journal Nieto Editores reported that these conditions continued to cause high mortality in Puerto Ricans. The cause of tropical sprue has still not been identified, but since the 1940s, it can be treated with folic acid and a 3 to 6-month course of antibiotics.|$|E
