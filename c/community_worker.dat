40|$|Background: Both {{non-governmental}} organisations and governmental organisations are {{very involved in}} {{the development and implementation of}} community empowerment programmes (CEPs). Because of various health issues within the community, 10 CEPs were launched in Ladysmith with a focus on addressing the particular needs of HIV-affected and -infected members. Of the 10 programmes, however, only four were deemed sustainable after five years. Objectives: The researcher explored the lived experiences of HIV <b>community</b> <b>workers</b> participating in two CEPs in Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal in order to develop recommendations for CEPs. Method: Data were explored using a qualitative hermeneutic phenomenological approach. Ten participants who had been involved in HIV CEPs for more than six months were identified and individual interviews were held. Results: Three themes emerged, namely, giving of yourself, maintaining sustainability and assisting the CEPs and <b>community</b> <b>workers.</b> Each of these themes also contained a number of subthemes. Exploring the lived experience of the <b>community</b> <b>workers</b> revealed that there are a number of ways in which to promote the sustainability of CEPs. Conclusion: The community should be involved in all aspects of the CEP and <b>community</b> <b>workers</b> must respect the community and their knowledge, experience and value systems. </p...|$|R

On the recommendation of the commission, the Annamalai University was opened in 1927. In 1931 he became its first Professor of Tamil language. Professor Vipulananda also received a second invitation to become the first Professor of Tamil soon after the University of Ceylon was established in 1943, which he held until his death in 1947. Thus Professor Vipulananda enjoys the unique distinction of being the first scholar to be appointed the first professor of Tamil in two Universities in two different countries.|$|E

The qualitative research method comprised five structured focus group interviews with 28 <b>community</b> health <b>workers</b> using open-ended questions to explore their perceptions. Analysis of the focus group data revealed that <b>community</b> health <b>workers</b> expressed reluctance to become involved in cases of violence against women. The reasons they provided are grouped under three main themes: barriers to identification; barriers to assessment; and barriers to intervention. Training programs offered to rural <b>community</b> health <b>workers</b> need to be aware of the barriers to identifying, assessing and intervening in cases of violence against women that are highlighted by this study.

40|$|BACKGROUND: South Africa has {{the highest}} {{prevalence}} of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) in the world yet many women {{have no access to}} clinic care or to physicians in their communities. The shortage of physicians trained in the diagnosis of FASD is even more severe. Thus {{there is a need to}} train <b>community</b> <b>workers</b> to assist in the delivery of health care. OBJECTIVES: This study reports on the effectiveness of training <b>community</b> <b>workers</b> to screen for a possible diagnosis of a FASD. METHODS: <b>Community</b> <b>workers</b> in Cape Town, South Africa were trained to screen for FASD in 139, 18 -month-old toddlers with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). Children were assessed according to the salient characteristics of individuals with PAE using height, weight, head circumference (OFC), philtrum, and lip measurements according to criteria set forth by the Institute of Medicine. Screen-positive children were referred for diagnostic assessment to a pediatrician reliably trained in the diagnosis of FASD. RESULTS: Of the screen-positive children, 93 % received an FASD diagnosis suggesting that the screening procedure was highly sensitive. Diagnoses included 15 % with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), 23 % with Partial FAS, and 62 % with Alcohol Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder (ARND, provisional). CONCLUSION: The use of <b>community</b> <b>workers</b> to screen for FASD represents a promising approach to effective diagnosis of children affected by PAE in areas lacking adequate medical resources...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{expand the}} access to {{culturally}} relevant hearing health services in a rural U. S. border community with already limited healthcare resources, <b>community</b> health <b>workers</b> (Promotoras de Salud) were trained to provide peer-facilitated hearing education classes. Design: A specialized three-phase training process for <b>community</b> health <b>workers</b> was developed, implemented, and evaluated. The training process included: 1) Focus groups with <b>community</b> health <b>workers</b> and residents from the community {{to raise awareness of}} hearing loss among <b>community</b> health <b>workers</b> and the community; 2) A 3 -hour workshop training to introduce basic topics to prepare <b>community</b> health <b>workers</b> to identify signs of hearing loss among community members and utilize effective communication strategies; and 3) A 24 -hour multi-session, interactive training over 6 weeks for <b>community</b> health <b>workers</b> who would become facilitators of educational and peer-support groups for individuals with hearing loss and family members. Study Sample: Twelve Spanish-speaking local <b>community</b> health <b>workers</b> employed by a federally qualified health center participated in a focus group, 12 received the general training, and four individuals with prior experience as health educators received further in-person training as facilitators of peer-education groups on hearing loss and communication. Results: <b>Community</b> health <b>workers</b> increased their knowledge base and confidence in effective communication strategies and developed skills in facilitating hearing education and peer support groups. Through case study practice, <b>community</b> health <b>workers</b> demonstrated competencies and applied their learning to specific situations related to effective communication with hearing loss, family support, assistive technology, use of hearing protection, and making referrals for hearing health care. Needs were identified for ongoing training in the area of assistive technology and addressing situations of more severe hearing loss. Conclusions: It is feasible to train <b>community</b> health <b>workers</b> to begin to address hearing loss and facilitate peer health education and support groups for individuals with hearing loss and their family members. In efforts to increase access to audiologic services in rural or hard-to-reach areas, application of the <b>community</b> health <b>worker</b> model with a partnership of audiologists deserves further consideration as a viable approach...|$|R

40|$|Low-income {{countries}} with high HIV/AIDS burdens in sub-Saharan Africa {{must deal with}} severe shortages of qualified human resources for health. This situation has triggered the renewed interest in <b>community</b> health <b>workers,</b> as they may {{play an important role}} in scaling-up antiretroviral treatment for HIV/AIDS by taking over a number of tasks from the professional health workers. Currently, a wide variety of <b>community</b> health <b>workers</b> are active in many antiretroviral treatment delivery sites. This article investigates whether present <b>community</b> health <b>worker</b> programmes for antiretroviral treatment are taking into account the lessons learnt from past experiences with <b>community</b> health <b>worker</b> programmes in primary health care and to what extent they are seizing the new antiretroviral treatment-specific opportunities. Based on a desk review of multi-purpose <b>community</b> health <b>worker</b> programmes for primary health care and of recent experiences with antiretroviral treatment-related <b>community</b> health <b>workers,</b> we developed an analytic framework of 10 criteria: eight conditions for successful large-scale antiretroviral treatment-related <b>community</b> health <b>worker</b> programmes and two antiretroviral treatment-specific opportunities. Our appraisal of six <b>community</b> health <b>worker</b> programmes, which we identified during field work in Ethiopia, Malawi and Uganda in 2007, shows that while some lessons from the past have been learnt, others are not being sufficiently considered and antiretroviral treatment-specific opportunities are not being sufficiently seized. In particular, all programmes have learnt the lesson that without adequate remuneration, <b>community</b> health <b>workers</b> cannot be retained in the long term. Yet we contend that the apparently insufficient attention to issues such as quality supervision and continuous training will lead to decreasing quality of the programmes over time. The life experience of people living with HIV/AIDS is still a relatively neglected asset, even though it may give antiretroviral treatment-related <b>community</b> health <b>worker</b> programmes better chances of success than their predecessors and may be crucially important for adherence and retention in large-scale antiretroviral treatment programmes. <b>Community</b> health <b>workers</b> as a community-based extension of health services are essential for antiretroviral treatment scale-up and comprehensive primary health care. The renewed attention to <b>community</b> health <b>workers</b> is thus very welcome, but the scale-up of <b>community</b> health <b>worker</b> programmes runs a high risk of neglecting the necessary quality criteria if it is not aligned with broader health systems strengthening. To achieve universal access to antiretroviral treatment, this is of paramount importance and should receive urgent attention...|$|R
