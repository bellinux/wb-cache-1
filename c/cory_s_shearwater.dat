40|$|<b>S.</b> A. <b>Cory,</b> <b>S.</b> Simmons Corban University, Salem, OR The affects of {{training}} to improve peak VO 2 {{during the offseason}} remain largely unidentified in regards to frequency and specificity {{of training}}. PURPOSE: To investigate which type of training improves peak VO 2 numbers in master cyclists. Cyclists were selected from a local riding club {{in the state of}} Oregon and were tested during a portion of the offseason (early fall to mid-spring). Physical training varied per cyclist and pre and post VO 2 max measurements were taken to determine which training method elicited a greater change in VO 2. METHODS: Master competitive cyclists (N= 4, mean age 49. 75 ± SD 6. 3) pre- and post-tested peak VO 2 on personal bicycles, while training for 11 weeks between the two tests. Each trained a minimum of 4 days/week, logging duration and activity type. Rider 1 trained through the incorporation of indoor and outdoor riding, as well as core stability; rider 2 followed a riding protocol on a fixed indoor trainer; rider 3 used cross-training (weight lifting, swimming, and running) combined with outdoor riding; rider 4 trained on both a fixed indoor trainer and an elliptical machine. The individual results were compared with each rider, as well as among the entire group in order to assess which method of training led to a greater improvement in peak VO 2. RESULTS: After performing a Kolmorgorov-Smirnov test, it was found the group was normally distributed (p= 0. 1) A t-test was then performed. There was no statistically significant difference in pre and post VO 2 values for the participants, t (3) = 2. 7, p=. 07 (pre-test M= 43. 07 ml/kg/min (± SD 4. 67), post-test M= 46. 35 ml/kg/min (± 3. 62)). The pre and post-test data revealed the VO 2 from the riders as follows: Rider 1 pre= 37. 8 (ml/kg/min), post= 41. 8 (ml/kg/min); Rider 2 pre= 47. 1 (ml/kg/min), post= 47. 6 (ml/kg/min); Rider 3 pre= 43. 6 (ml/kg/min), post= 45. 6 (ml/kg/min); and Rider 4 pre= 45. 2 (ml/kg/min), post= 50. 4 (ml/kg/min). Rider 1 increased peak VO 2 by 10. 5 %, rider 2 increased by 1. 0 %, rider 3 increased by 4. 4 %, and rider 4 increased by 11. 5 %. CONCLUSION: Although the sample size was small, the pilot study showed similar changes in peak VO 2 with different methods of training when performed for 4 days/week. Four days per week of off-season training can elicit positive changes in VO 2. Further investigation should be done to compare which specific modes and training duration could elicit the best improvements in VO 2 for master cyclists...|$|R
40|$|Human pilots {{have the}} {{extraordinary}} ability to remotely maneuver small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) far outside the flight envelope of conventional autopilots. Given the tremendous thrust-to-weight ratio available on these small machines [1, 2], linear control approaches have recently produced impressive demonstrations that {{come close to}} matching this agility for a certain class of aerobatic maneuvers where the rotor or propeller forces dominate {{the dynamics of the}} aircraft [3, 4, 5]. However, as our flying machines scale down to smaller sizes (e. g. Micro Aerial Vehicles) operating at low Reynold's numbers, viscous forces dominate propeller thrust [6, 7, 8], causing classical control (and design) techniques to fail. These new technologies will require a different approach to control, where the control system will need to reason about the long term and time dependent effects of the unsteady fluid dynamics on the response of the vehicle. Perching is representative of a large class of control problems for aerobatics that requires and agile and robust control system with the capability of planning well into the future. Our experimental paradigm along with the simplicity of the problem structure has allowed us to study the problem at the most fundamental level. This thesis presents methods and results for identifying an aerodynamic model of a small glider at very high angles-of-attack using tools from supervised machine learning and system identification. Our model then serves as a benchmark platform for studying control of perching using an optimal control framework, namely reinforcement learning. Our results indicate that a compact parameterization of the control is sufficient to successfully execute the task in simulation. by Rick E. <b>Cory.</b> Thesis (<b>S.</b> M.)

40|$|We {{investigated}} seabird-eddy {{associations in}} subtropical {{waters of the}} southern Indian Ocean during a summer (January) cruise from Amsterdam Island to Western Australia. To determine habitat associations and to enable predictions about foraging strategies, we related the distributions of satellite altimetry data (sea surface height anomalies) to the 3 most abundant taxa in the study area: terns (sooty Sterna fuscata and bridled <b>S.</b> anaethetus) and <b>shearwaters</b> (wedge-tailed Puffinus pacificus) were significantly more common and numerous within convergence zones. However, a step-wise logistic regression model revealed that these seabirds were more strongly associated with other habitat variables, including the distance to breeding colonies and warm sea surface temperature conditions. Great-winged petrels Pterodroma macroptera were widely scattered and did not show associations with convergences or divergences. These contrasting results highlight the need to consider smaller-scale hydrographic features, such as frontal systems, when guantifying seabird associations with mesoscale eddies. Large-scale patterns of ocean circulation and mesoscale variability also seem to {{play a critical role}} in determining the extent of seabird-eddy associations. In contrast with previous studies, which have focused on dynamic frontal regions and energetic current systems, we surveyed a region of weak mesoscale variability north of the Subtropical Convergence zone. © Inter-Research 2006...|$|R
40|$|Transgenic mouse lines {{carrying}} the N-myc oncogene deregulated by the immunoglobulin heavy-chain enhancer spontaneously develop B-lymphoid tumors (R. Dildrop, A. Ma, K. Zimmerman, E. Hsu, A.

Permanent cell lines derived from these tumors (E mu-N-myc cell lines) express extremely {{high levels of}} the N-myc transgene but little or no detectable endogenous N-myc or c-myc. We have employed nuclear run-on assays to show that down-regulation of endogenous N- and c-myc expression occurs at the transcriptional level. To determine whether the lack of endogenous myc gene transcription is a direct effect of high-level N-myc transgene expression, we have generated Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) -transformed cell lines from prelymphomatous E mu-N-myc mice (A-MuLV/E mu-N-myc cell lines). Although these A-MuLV/E mu-N-myc lines express very high levels of the N-myc transgene, they continue to transcribe the endogenous c-myc gene. These findings demonstrate that high-level N-myc gene expression alone does not necessarily lead to down-regulation of endogenous myc gene expression and suggest that events associated with transformation by N-myc may be critical to this process...|$|R

University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2015 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 64 - 65) With the growing population, technology is growing without any bounds. With these advancements, {{we have reached}} a footing where we cannot imagine the world without communications. This dependability on communications strikes a need for highly reliable and cost effective communication technology {{from the perspective of}} the user as well as the service provider. Though the 3 GPP’s Long Term Evolution (LTE) has been successful to mitigate most of the challenges, there arises a need to foresee the cellular network evolution considering various factors like increase in number of users in a particular area, urbanization etc., and accordingly use the features of LTE to overcome the effects of them before actually deploying the network in the real world. This thesis outlines the requirement for an effective 4 G LTE simulator that can model the real world cellular network by considering the various effects on a wireless network like fading, pathloss, number of users and resource allocation. It can then explore various aspects of 4 G LTE that contributes towards design and analysis of the network performance for various scenarios supporting deployment of the new network for futuristic operation or optimizing the existing network. In this study we closely look through a System level LTE Simulator developed by the Institute of Telecommunications of The Vienna University of Technology, Austria. Using this simulator we study different scheduling schemes to evaluate performance and demonstrate how important the role of scheduling scheme is to overcome network congestion. We study various features of LTE that help in increasing throughput for various traffic models over a network and demonstrate the role of small cells in increasing the overall throughput of the network by comparing with the existing macro cell network. Various parameters are varied and results are obtained for various scenarios using the Vienna LTE simulator. These results are then used to demonstrate how Quality of Service (QoS), capacity planning, and resource management are achieved through LTE technology. This study helps the service provider to offer reliable service at lower implementation cost and deploy a network that has ability to sustain the evolution.
