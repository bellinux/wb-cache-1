5|$|The {{increasing}} {{focus on}} Women's Rights in the United States during the 1980s {{focused attention on}} the fact that many drugs being prescribed for women had never actually been tested in women of child-bearing potential, and that there was a relative paucity of basic research into women's health. In response to this the National Institutes of Health (NIH) created the Office of Research on Women's Health (ORWH) in 1990 to address these inequities. In 1993 the National Institutes of Health Revitalisation Act officially reversed US policy by requiring NIH funded phase III <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> to include women. This resulted in an increase in women recruited into research studies. The next phase was the specific funding of large scale epidemiology studies and <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> focussing on women's health such as the Women's Health Initiative (1991), the largest disease prevention study conducted in the US. Its role was to study the major causes of death, disability and frailty in older women. Despite this apparent progress, women remain underepresented. In 2006 women accounted for less than 25% of <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> published in 2004, A follow up study by the same authors five years later found little evidence of improvement. Another study found between 10–47% of women in heart disease <b>clinical</b> <b>trials,</b> despite the prevalence of heart disease in women. Lung cancer {{is the leading cause of}} cancer death amongst women, but while the number of women enrolled in lung cancer studies is increasing, they are still far less likely to be enrolled than men.|$|E

5|$|Changes {{in the way}} {{research}} ethics was visualised in {{the wake}} of the Nuremberg Trials (1946), led to an atmosphere of protectionism of groups deemed to be vulnerable that was often legislated or regulated. This resulted in the relative underrepresentation of women in <b>clinical</b> <b>trials.</b> The position of women in research was further compromised in 1977, when in response to the tragedies resulting from thalidomide and diethylstilbestrol (DES), the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prohibited women of child bearing years from participation in early stage <b>clinical</b> <b>trials.</b> In practice this ban was often applied very widely to exclude all women. Women, at least those in the child bearing years, were also deemed unsuitable research subjects due to their fluctuating hormonal levels during the menstrual cycle. However, research has demonstrated significant biological differences between the sexes in rates of susceptibility, symptoms and response to treatment in many major areas of health, including heart disease and some cancers. These exclusions pose a threat to the application of evidence-based medicine to women, and compromise to care offered to both women and men.|$|E
