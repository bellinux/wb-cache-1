5|$|Storm surges {{caused by}} extratropical {{cyclones}} {{have been recorded}} along the <b>coastal</b> <b>areas.</b> These storm surges are formed from strong winds that blow towards the land. They are formed due to {{the interaction between the}} semi-permanent South Pacific High and a low pressure system over the Atlantic, southeast of Argentina, creating strong winds from the south or southwest. The sudestada, which brings the worst storm surges, occurs when there is a high pressure system over southern Argentina in the Atlantic Ocean that interacts with a low pressure over Uruguay and southern Brazil, causing strong winds from the southeast. Storm surges have caused flooding of <b>coastal</b> <b>areas,</b> leading to extensive property loss and other damage. It is also the main natural factor in the erosion of coastlines. The flooding as a result of storm surges are particularly destructive in flat <b>coastal</b> <b>areas</b> such as the Rio de La Plata shores, and the Salado Basin.|$|E
