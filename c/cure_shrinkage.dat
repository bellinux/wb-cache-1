Experimental evidence based on Scanning Electron Microscopy, polymerization under pressure, photopolymerization, and solvent extraction indicates that the reduction in <b>cure</b> <b>shrinkage</b> is due to the nucleation and growth of vapor bubbles of the low-boiling monomer within separate microdomains formed during rapid polymerization and precipitated by the high temperatures attained at peak exotherm, as well as negative hydrostatic pressures arising from <b>cure</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of the crosslinked polymer phase...|$|E
40|$|A {{relatively}} new advanced composite matrix, polycyanate ester, was evaluated for <b>cure</b> <b>shrinkage.</b> The chemical <b>cure</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of composites {{is difficult to}} model {{but a number of}} clever experimental techniques are available to the investigator. In this work the method of curing a prepreg layup on top of a previously cured laminate of identical ply composition is utilized. The polymeric matrices used in advanced composites have been primarily epoxies and therefore a common system of this type, Fiberite 3501 - 6, was used as a base case material. Three polycyanate matrix systems were selected for the study. These are: Fiberite 954 - 2 A, YLA RS- 3, and Bryte Technology BTCy- 1. The first three of these systems were unidirectional prepreg with carbon fiber reinforcement. The Bryte Technology material was reinforced with E-glass fabric. The technique used to evaluate <b>cure</b> <b>shrinkage</b> results in distortion of the flatness of an otherwise symmetric laminate. The first laminate is cured in a conventional fashion. An identical layup is cured on this first laminate. During the second cure all constituents are exposed to the same thermal cycles. However, only the new portion of the laminate will experience volumetric changes associate with matrix cure. The additional strain of <b>cure</b> <b>shrinkage</b> results in an unsymmetric distribution of residual stresses and an associated warpage of the laminate. The baseline material, Fiberite 3501 - 6, exhibited <b>cure</b> <b>shrinkage</b> that was in accordance with expectations. Cure strains were {minus} 4. 5 E- 04. The YLA RS- 3 material had cure strains somewhat lower at {minus} 3. 2 E- 04. The Fiberite 954 - 2 A cure strain was {minus} 1. 5 E- 04 that is 70 % lower than the baseline material.

40|$|<b>Cure</b> <b>shrinkage</b> is an {{inherent}} property of polymerizing systems {{due to the}} conversion of secondary bonds between monomer (or prepolymer) molecules to primary bonds, which have smaller interatomic distances. <b>Cure</b> <b>shrinkage</b> is highly undesirable: it impairs dimensional control and causes poor surface finish in molded polymers; it also generates setting stresses in highly filled systems. Previous methods for <b>cure</b> <b>shrinkage</b> control require special materials and conditions or entail the formation of voids. In this investigation, two processes were developed for producing polymer systems with zero shrinkage or slight expansion: (a) use of ammonia-modified montomorillonite as additive; and (b) microphase separation. The first method utilizes the dilatation of specially-modified montmorillonite (MMT) particles to counteract resin polymerization shrinkage. The MMT particles are first processed by replacing part of their hydration water with ammonia (which forms coordination bonds with SiO 2 in the mineral crystal) then dispersed into the resin. During cure at ambient temperatures the polymerization exotherm raises the temperature to 60 - 80 ∘C, breaking the SiO 2 -NH 3 bonds; however the liberated gaseous ammonia cannot escape outside the resin-embedded MMT particles and forces them to dilate to more than twice their original size.

In epoxy resin curing reaction process, phenomena such as heat of reaction, reaction progress (degree of cure, physical properties, etc.), <b>cure</b> <b>shrinkage</b> and viscoelastic behavior, are related intricately. It is known that there are serious problems of delamination at the metal- epoxy resin interface and crack failure in epoxy resin due to <b>cure</b> <b>shrinkage</b> when epoxy resin is used as encapsulating medium of insulators in electrical and electronic equipments. It {{is very difficult to}} make experimentally clear the mechanism of the delamination and crack failure occurring in electrical and electronic equipments during curing reaction. Though several papers have been reported on the attempts to predict the stress-strain behavior during curing reaction, their simulation model is proposed under the conditions without <b>cure</b> <b>shrinkage,</b> heat of reaction, reaction progress, delamination or crack failure. Therefore, previous works cannot be always applied to the practical production process. In order to solve these problems, the authors have proposed a new simulation model, which can applies to the curing process from potting (liquid state) to gelling (solid state) under a constant curing temperature. In this work, the authors have attempted the simulation with a finite element method for two-stage cure reaction as follows: Epoxy resin was potted between the inner and outer iron cylinders. The potted epoxy resin was cured under a given temperature before gelling and under a higher temperature during gelling (two-stage cure reaction). In order to express the two-stage cure reaction, the equation of cure reaction was corrected.

The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the effect of postcure and thermal aging on the properties of molding compound. Knowledge of the effect of thermal aging is important for manufacturers since electronic devices are often exposed to high temperatures for long time periods. For instance if a product is placed close to the engine of a car, the effect of thermal aging has to be taken into account to predict accurately stresses and strains. Thermal aging results in a tremendous change of properties which might lead to failure of electronic components.

40|$|Resin {{transfer}} molding (RTM) has great {{potential to become}} an efficient and economical process for fabricating large and complicated automotive composite structures. Low capital investment, excellent mechanical properties, closed mold processing, low pressure equipment, short cycle times and process versatility in component integration and assembly, make RTM very attractive for high volume automotive applications. However, a high class surface finish, required for exterior car body panels, is difficult to achieve with RTM. There are several material and process parameters that severely affect the surface quality of RTM molded components. One of the major contributing factors is the shrinkage related to the curing of thermoset resins. A volumetric shrinkage of 7 - 10 % is common for polyester resins, which breaks the material's contact with the tool, resulting in poor surface finish. Low profile additives (LPA) {{are added to the}} polyester resin for shrinkage compensation; however the effects of LPA content on thermal, rheological and morphological properties of polyester resins, as well as surface finish aspects of resulting composites, are not well understood. In this research, the influence of material and processing parameters on the surface finish is characterized through experimental design techniques. Analytical, experimental and numerical methods are employed to optimize processing conditions for class A finish quality and shorter cycle times. Specifically, the effects of LPA content on cure kinetics, <b>cure</b> <b>shrinkage</b> and morphological changes are investigated through differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), rheological and optical microscopic techniques. Models are developed to predict <b>cure</b> <b>shrinkage,</b> LPA expansion, cure kinetics and viscosity variations of the resin. These models are then incorporated in commercial software to predict resin flow, degree-of-cure evolution and pressure variations during cure. Analytical and numerical simulation results are then validated with the experimental data. Processing windows defined for different process parameters based on analytical and numerical analyses are further used in the test matrices designed through the Taguchi method. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple regression analyses are carried out on the surface roughness of test samples molded under varying conditions. The relative influence of the most significant parameters is characterized and empirical models are developed to predict surface roughness. The effect of post-cure shrinkage on the surface roughness of the test samples is also investigated. Levels of the most significant process parameters are then set for a high class surface finish, minimum cost and short cycle times. The results show that the LPA content had no significant effect on the cure kinetics; however <b>cure</b> <b>shrinkage</b> decreased non-linearly with increasing LPA content. LPA content at 10 % was found to be the minimum amount for shrinkage compensation. LPA content (≥ 10 %) resulted in pressure increase and morphological changes during RTM manufacturing. A cure gradient was observed for low pressure injections which had a significant effect on the resin pressure and roughness. LPA was found to be the most influential parameter affecting surface finish. A minimum of 10 % LPA was required for class A surface finish. Higher injection pressures and filler content improved surface quality, whereas styrene content, cure rate and temperature gradient had no effect on the surface roughness in the range tested.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} failure modes in microelectronics devices is the delamination of epoxy materials (adhesives, molding compounds). The thermal mismatch at the interface between materials leads to stresses that build up during processing steps at different temperatures and in the following thermal cycling through use of the device or reliability testing. These stresses arc well understood and are commonly investigated by finite element modeling. Epoxy molding compounds undergo a chemical reaction during processing called curing. Here the two components epoxy and hardener react to form a 3 D network giving the molding compound its final material properties. During this process, the volume of the compound decreases, a phenomenon called <b>cure</b> <b>shrinkage.</b> The shrinkage itself can be experimentally determined, e. g. using volumetric measurements. However, due to relaxation processes that take place at higher temperatures and the changing thermal-mechanical properties during the curing process, the stresses that build up due to chemical shrinkage are more complex to consider.

Samples of molding compound on Cu-leadframe material were manufactured using standard procedures.

40|$|Abstract]: Composites {{made from}} vinyl ester resins suffer {{considerable}} <b>shrinkage</b> during <b>curing</b> and after solidification. This shrinkage is particularly serious if the fibre composite components {{are large and}} can be up to twelve percent (Schwartz, 1992; Clarke, 1996; Matthews and Rawlings, 1994). Currently, the shrinkage problem is solved by breaking a large composite component into smaller composite parts because smaller parts tend to have less shrinkage. These smaller parts are then joined together to form the overall structure. However, the manufacturing lead-time and costs of a composite component are significantly increased. This project attempts to reduce the shrinkage of the components cast from uncured 33 % by weight or 44 % by volume of fly ash particulate-reinforced vinyl esters [VE/FLYASH (33 %) ]. This is accomplished by shortening the curing time of the resins using penetrating microwave energy. The formation of pinholes in the samples resulted in {{the expansion of the}} volume of the materials in the initial stage of the curing process.

40|$|Hyperbranched polyesters {{modified}} {{with long}} aliphatic chains with vinyl or epoxy groups as chain ends were synthesized and added as modifiers to diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A/toluene- 2, 4 -diisocyanate mixtures {{in the presence}} of benzyldimethylamine as catalyst. The influence of the addition of these modifiers on the curing was investigated by thermal analysis and infrared spectroscopy. The materials obtained were investigated by electron microscopy and some mechanical characteristics were determined by nanoindentation tests. Epoxy terminated hyperbranched led to homogeneous materials with high crosslinking densities, whereas vinyl terminated hyperbranched produced phase separated morphologies. The materials showing phase separation presented a tough fracture, whereas the homogeneous materials obtained with epoxidated hyperbranched showed increased brittleness on increasing the proportion of modifier. On increasing the proportion of vinyl terminated hyperbranched in the thermosets, Young’s modulus and hardness decreased but the addition of epoxy terminated hyperbranched did not influence these parameters. The addition of vinylic hyperbranched to the formulations produced a decrease in the <b>curing</b> <b>shrinkage,</b> whereas the epoxidic hyperbranched did not. Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} a finite element approach {{for the analysis of}} the thermo-hygro-mechanical-hydration behaviour of concrete structures. The thermo-hygro component considers the mass balance equation of moisture as well as the enthalpy balance equation, and uses two primary variables, namely the capillary pressure and temperature. Heat of hydration is simulated using the approach of Schlinder and Folliard. The basic mechanical model simulates directional cracking, rough crack closure and crushing using a plastic-damage-contact approach. Hydration dependency is introduced into the mechanical constitutive model. The material data from the Concrack benchmark (CEOS. fr, 2013) are considered with the model. This includes data on adiabatic temperature changes during curing, changing elastic properties during <b>curing,</b> <b>shrinkage</b> and creep. The model, as implemented in the finite element program LUSAS, is used to analyse the Concrack benchmark beam RL 1. Particular attention is paid to crack openings and the difference between predicted crack openings from analyses with and without time dependent effects. It is concluded that ignoring time dependent effects can result in a significant under-estimate of crack openings in the working load range...|$|R
