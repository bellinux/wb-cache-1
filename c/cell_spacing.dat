Yamaguchi discussed <b>cell</b> <b>spaces</b> which are one of approaches to establish biomathematics. More than two states are introduced in the <b>cell</b> <b>space.</b> By algebraic methods, in a <b>cell</b> <b>space</b> with four or two states it is proved that a set of all configurations is a vector space {{and a set of}} all possible stable configurations is a vector subspace. Thus, in the <b>cell</b> <b>space</b> with four or two states any stable configuration is represented by a superposition of elementary stable configurations. Furthermore, it is proved that in the <b>cell</b> <b>space</b> with two states, there exists one to one correspondence between the set of stable configurations and the set of garden of Eden configurations. The invariant boundary is introduced in the <b>cell</b> <b>space</b> with two states, which generate some variant cell subspaces whose configuration oscillates among definite configurations.

The pattern of stable configuration is remarkably changed when the thresholds of the local transition rule exceeds some critical values. It is shown that the stable configurations in the m × n <b>cell</b> <b>space</b> are dependent on both the size of the basic <b>cell</b> <b>space</b> and the type of local transition rule. Hierarchy of types of local transition rules and cluster property of stable configurations are obtained.

The {{radiation}} impedance of a capacitive {{micromachined ultrasonic transducer}} (cMUT) with a circular membrane is calculated analytically using its velocity profile for the frequencies up to its parallel resonance frequency for both the immersion and the airborne applications. The results are verified by finite element simulations. The work is extended to calculate the radiation impedance of an array of cMUT cells positioned in a hexagonal pattern. A higher radiation resistance improves the bandwidth {{as well as the}} efficiency of the cMUT. The radiation resistance is determined to be a strong function of the <b>cell</b> <b>spacing.</b> It is shown that a center-to-center <b>cell</b> <b>spacing</b> of 1. 25 wavelengths maximizes the radiation resistance, if the membranes are not too thin.

40|$|Aerodynamic and {{acoustic}} measurements of shock-free and shock-containing plumes were acquired for several supersonic free-jet model nozzles. The {{purpose was to}} investigate important features of the broadband shock noise generation process. The aerodynamic measurements include the variation of shock <b>cell</b> <b>spacing</b> and strength {{as a function of}} nozzle pressure ratio, and longitudinal turbulent-mass-flux axial development as determined by a hot-film probe. In addition, correlations of the hot-film probe with a near-field microphone were obtained. These measurements provide useful information concerning the relation of peak shock noise frequency and level with variations in shock <b>cell</b> <b>spacing</b> and strength. In general, it is shown that a distinction must be made between plumes containing weak and strong imbedded shocks. Strong shocks diminish the level of emitted shock noise and influence the behavior of the jet mixing noise process. The probable location and spectral content for the shock-shear layer interaction mechanism is indicated by the correlations. Numerical inviscid plume comparisons with experimental data are also included...|$|E

Stresses associated to morphological instability and pattern formation are analysed. Due to compressions and dilatations induced by the local curvature of the solidification front (Laplace law), strain contrasts in crystal parts close to the interface appear {{in the early stages}} of amplification of perturbations. Advection of dislocations into the grooves and subboundaries outcropping are evidenced for a cellular solid-liquid interface. Two types of strains are left in the grown solid by a cellular microstructure, related to nearly periodic emission of droplets and high gradients of solute, which locally create regions with important parametric mismatch.

40|$|Al-Fe {{hypoeutectic}} alloys are {{a family}} of casting alloys characterized by cell growth, low cost and appreciable formability. It {{is well known that}} fatigue strength is a requirement of prime importance considering the nature of load typically observed during operations involving the risers used in oil extraction. The aim {{of this study is to}} examine the influence of cell size and its intercellular phase distribution on the fatigue life (Nf) of the directionally solidified Al- 0. 5, 1. 0 and 1. 5 wt% Fe alloys. A water-cooled vertical upward unidirectional solidification system was used to provide the castings. Microscopy light and SEM microscopy were used. It was found that fatigue life decreases as <b>cell</b> <b>spacing</b> (&# 955; c) increases. Smaller <b>cell</b> <b>spacing</b> allows a homogeneous distribution of Al-Fe fibers to happen within the intercellular regions, which tends to improve the mentioned fatigue property. Hall-Petch type correlations [Nf= Nf 0 +A(&# 955;c - 1 / 2) -B(&# 955;c - 1); where A and B are constants] seems to be able to encompass the fatigue life variation along the Al-Fe alloys...|$|E
40|$|Solidification {{microstructure}} is {{a defining}} link between production techniques and the mechanical properties of metals {{and in particular}} steel. Due {{to the difficulty of}} conducting solidification studies at high temperature, knowledge of the development of solidification microstructure in steel is scarce. In this study, a laser-scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) has been used to observe in situ and in real-time the planar to cellular to dendritic transition of the progressing solid/liquid interface in low carbon steel. Because the in situ observations in the laser-scanning confocal microscopy are restricted to the surface, the effect of sample thickness on surface observations was determined. Moreover, the effect of cooling rate and alloy composition on the planar to cellular interface transition was investigated. In the low-alloyed, low-carbon steel studied, the cooling rate {{does not seem to have}} an effect on the spacing of the cellular microstructure. However, in the presence of copper and manganese, the <b>cell</b> <b>spacing</b> decreased at higher cooling rates. Higher concentrations of copper in steel resulted on an increased <b>cell</b> <b>spacing</b> at the same cooling rates...|$|E

40|$|An {{efficient}} algorithm for contact detection among many arbitrarily sized objects is developed. Objects are allocated to cells {{based on their}} location and size within a nested hierarchical <b>cell</b> <b>space.</b> The choice of optimal cell sizes {{and the number of}} hierarchies for best performance is not trivial in most cases. To overcome this challenge, a novel analytical method to determine the optimal hierarchical <b>cell</b> <b>space</b> for a given object size distribution is presented. With this, a decision can be made between using the classical Linked-Cell method and the contact detection algorithm presented. For polydisperse systems with size ratios up to 50, we achieved 220 times speed-up compared to the classical Linked-Cell method. For larger size ratios, even better speed-up is expected. The complexity of the algorithm is linear with the number of objects when the optimal hierarchical <b>cell</b> <b>space</b> is chosen.

40|$|Aim: To compare neural {{resolution}} and detection {{limits of the}} human mid-/long-wavelength and short-wavelength cone systems with anatomical estimates of photoreceptor and retinal ganglion cell spacings and sizes. Method: Detection and resolution limits were measured from central fixation out to 35 ° eccentricity across the horizontal visual field using a modified Lotmar interferometer. The mid-/long-wavelength cone system was studied using a green (550 nm) test stimulus to which S-cones have low sensitivity. To bias {{resolution and}} detection to the short-wavelength cone system, a blue (450 nm) test stimulus was presented against a bright yellow background that desensitized the M- and L-cones. Participants were three trichromatic males with normal visual functions. Results: With green stimuli, resolution showed a steep central-peripheral gradient that was similar between participants, whereas the detection gradient was shallower and patterns were different between participants. Detection and resolution with blue stimuli were poorer than for green stimuli. The detection of blue stimuli was superior to resolution across the horizontal visual field and the patterns were different between participants. Conclusion: The mid-/long-wavelength cone system’s resolution is limited by midget ganglion <b>cell</b> <b>spacing</b> and its detection {{is limited by the}} size of the M- and L-cone photoreceptors, consistent with previous observations. We found that no such simple relationships occur for the short-wavelength cone system between resolution and the bistratified ganglion <b>cell</b> <b>spacing,</b> nor between detection and the S-cone photoreceptor sizes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Upward {{directional}} transient solidification {{experiments have}} been carried out with an Al- 1. 0 wt%Fe alloy. Tensile tests were carried out with samples collected along the casting length and these results have been correlated with measured cell spacings, since cellular growth has prevailed along the directionally solidified casting. The resulting mechanical properties include ultimate tensile strength, yield tensile strength and elongation. The used casting assembly was designed {{in such a way that}} the heat was extracted only through the water-cooled system at bottom of the casting. During non-equilibrium solidification, typical of DC (direct chill) castings, different cooling rates occur from the casting cooled surface up to the top of the casting, causing the formation of metastable intermetallic phases (AlmFe, Al 6 Fe, etc) in addition to the stable Al 3 Fe phase. The extensive presence of plate-like Al 3 Fe phase in the as-cast structure adversely influences the mechanical properties of Al-Fe alloys, since this morphology is more likely to induce microcracks than the fibrous Al 6 Fe phase. In order to permit an appropriate characterization of these intermetallic phases, they were extracted from the aluminum-rich matrix by using a dissolution technique. These phases were then investigated by optical microscopy and SEM techniques. It was found that the ultimate tensile strength, the yield strength and the elongation increase with decreasing <b>cell</b> <b>spacing</b> and experimental laws correlating <b>cell</b> <b>spacing</b> and these mechanical properties have been established...|$|E
