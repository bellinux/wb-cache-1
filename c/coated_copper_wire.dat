50|$|Copper wire does pose some {{challenges}} {{in that it}} is harder than both gold and aluminum, so bonding parameters must be kept under tight control. The formation of oxides is inherent with this material, so storage and shelf life are issues that must be considered. Special packaging is required in order to protect copper wire and achieve a longer shelf life. Palladium <b>coated</b> <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> is a common alternative which has shown significant resistance to corrosion, albeit at a higher hardness than pure copper and a greater price, though still less than gold. During the fabrication of wire bonds, copper wire, as well as its plated varieties, must be worked in the presence of forming gas nitrogen and 5% hydrogen or a similar anoxic gas in order to prevent corrosion. A method for coping with copper's relative hardness is the use of high purity 5N+ varieties.|$|E

Tungsten carbide cobalt (WC-Co) metal matrix composites (MMC) commonly finds applications as tool and die materials. Yet due to complex stochastic nature of WEDM process and the involvement of high number of input variables the full potential of the process has not been realized. In this present article material removal rate and surface roughness of the Tungsten carbide-cobalt (WC-Co) composite material subjected to wire electric discharge machining was studied.

With different implementations of the insulator layer, the magneto-impedance effect of Composite Wire A, whose insulator layer is cast from the melt Pyrex, is significantly {{higher than that of}} Composite Wire B with an insulator of sputtered SiO 2 layer. The profile of the insulator layer, as well as the thickness of magnetic layer and the diameter of the conductive core, greatly influences the interaction between the magnetic layer of Ni–Fe and the copper core, as shown in their giant magneto-impedance (GMI) effects. The maximum MI ratios obtained from Composite Wires A and B are 226 % at 800 kHz when Hext = 0. 87 Oe, and 95 % at 1 MHz when Hext = 0 Oe, respectively. The Composite Wire A is a promising candidate for the sensing element of high sensitivity sensors to very weak magnetic field.

40|$|Several {{renewable}} and (claimed) {{sustainable energy}} sources {{have been introduced}} into the market the during the last centuries {{in an attempt to}} battle pollution from fossil fuels. Especially biomass energy technologies have been under debate for their sustainability. A new biomass energy technology was introduced in 2008 : the Plant-Microbial Fuel Cell (PMFC). In this system electricity can be generated with living plants and thus bioelectricity and biomass production can be combined on the same surface. A green roof producing electricity with a P-MFC could be an interesting combination. P-MFC technology is nearing implementation in the market and therefore we assessed the environmental performance of the system with an early stage Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The environmental performance of the P-MFC is currently worse than of conventional electricity production technologies. This is mainly due to the limited power output of the P-MFC and the materials presently used in the P-MFC. Granular activated carbon (anode material), goldwires (current collectors) and Teflon <b>coated</b> <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> (connecting anode and cathode) have the largest impact on the environmental performance.

Although economics has been the driving mechanism to lower semiconductor packaging costs for a savings of about 20 % by replacing gold <b>wire</b> bonds with <b>copper,</b> copper also has materials property advantages over gold. When compared to gold, copper has approximately: 25 % lower electrical resistivity, 30 % higher thermal conductivity, 75 % higher tensile strength and 45 % higher modulus of elasticity. <b>Copper</b> <b>wire</b> bonds on aluminum bond pads are also more mechanically robust over time and elevated temperature due to the slower intermetallic formation rate - approximately 1 / 100 th that of the gold to aluminum intermetallic formation rate. However, there are significant tradeoffs with <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> bonding - <b>copper</b> has twice the hardness of gold which results in a narrower bonding manufacturing process window and requires that the semiconductor companies design more mechanically rigid bonding pads to prevent cratering to both the bond pad and underlying chip structure. Furthermore, copper is significantly more prone to corrosion issues. The semiconductor packaging industry has responded to this corrosion concern by creating a palladium <b>coated</b> <b>copper</b> bonding <b>wire,</b> which is more corrosion resistant than pure <b>copper</b> bonding <b>wire.</b> Also, the selection of the device molding compound is critical because use of environmentally friendly green compounds can result in internal CTE (Coefficient of Thermal Expansion) mismatches with the <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> bonds that can eventually lead to device failures during thermal cycling.

In contrast to the current standard interconnection technology, using three to five flat ribbons to be soldered on continuous or segmented busbars on the solar cells front side and on large contact pads on the solar cells rear side, the Multi Busbar concept uses twelve to fifteen round solder <b>coated</b> <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> to be soldered on {{a large number of}} small contact pads for each polarity. In this paper we present two finite element models, one for a solar cell with a common busbar-based interconnection and a second one for a solar cell using the Multi Busbar interconnection approach to analyze and compare the distribution of the thermomechanical stress induced by the cell interconnection. The results show only a slight vertical deformation of a contacted solar cell of 0. 4 mm for the three busbar design and 2. 2 mm for the Multi Busbar interconnection technology due to the non-symmetric pad layout and the aluminum metallization on the rear side. However, most parts of the copper interconnector (ribbons and wires) are plastically deformed because the tensile stress exceeds the yield strength of 100 MPa. In addition, the results indicate that there is only slight tensile stress {{in most parts of the}} silicon solar cell after the soldering process.

40|$|Investigating the {{contribution}} of roots in the reinforcement of slopes against shallow landslides needs {{to better understand the}} local root-soil interactions at the root and root-soil block scales. Many experimental studies were carried out in order to quantify {{the contribution}} of roots to soil shear strength. Most of these experiments consist in shearing rectangular parallelepiped soil blocks (shear tests) with and without roots and deducing a “root additional cohesion-friction angle” from the analyses of resulting response curves. However {{it is often difficult to}} interpret the results without considering the effect of each individual root as well as the group effect involved by neighbor roots. Finite Element Models (FEM) can help analyzing the distribution of stresses and strains (elastic or plastic) within a heterogeneous solid body submitted to external forces. The aim of this study is to present such a FEM that simulates shear tests of root-soil blocks, and to analyze numerically {{the contribution of}} root elements on the mechanical response of the global system.

The objective {{of this study was}} to measure the amounts of tin, copper, zinc, silver, nickel and chromium in the aerosol from four brands of EC and to identify the sources of these metals by examining the elemental composition of the atomizer components. Four brands of popular EC were dissected and the cartomizers were examined microscopically. Elemental composition of cartomizer components was determined using integrated energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis, and the concentrations of the tin, copper, zinc silver, nickel, and chromium in the aerosol were determined for each brand using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy.

However to ensure that this level of optimisation and quality can be maintained the focus of research has moved towards the occupational health and safety of the welder. Fume formation rates of welding consumables is one of the areas of interest. Copper has long been used in the production of welding wires firstly as a drawing aid but of late as a protective coating on carbon steel wires to improve the shelf life of the product and secondly to decrease the electrical contact resistance. Previous studies of the fume formation rate (FFR) have indicated that <b>copper</b> <b>coated</b> welding <b>wires</b> produce more fume than un-coppered <b>wires.</b> The <b>copper</b> content of welding wires is defined as a total value that will include the base metal copper content and the added <b>copper</b> in the <b>coating.</b> The initial investigation focussed on the determination of the FFR of a group of welding wires of known chemical composition welded using a fixed set of welding parameters. The wires were further characterised by determining the quality and appearance of their surface condition and the possible influence that this may have had on the FFR results. The tests confirmed that there was an increase in the FFR with the <b>copper</b> <b>coated</b> <b>wires,</b> however a large variation in results was observed. It was further noted that the un-coppered wires were very unstable during the welding process, indicating that the welding parameters may not have been optimised for these wires. To eliminate fluctuations caused by variations in the chemical composition and manufacturing process that may have influenced the FFR a group of wires were specifically manufactured for this investigation. These wires originated from the same base material and were manufactured following the same manufacturing route. The major difference was that the amount of copper deposited on two of the wires was accurately controlled to deliver two levels of total copper content. In addition to the control of the basic chemical composition of the wires, FFR testing was performed using an “auto-control” unit developed by the University of Wollongong to maintain optimum welding parameters. The results of this testing indicated that the increase in FFR for <b>coppered</b> <b>wires</b> varied from 18 % to 32 %. The second part of the investigation concentrated on finding an explanation for the increased FFR as a result of increased copper content in the welding wire. Several hypothesis were developed and tested and the most likely explanation for the increase in the FFR seemed {{to be related to the}} increase in the droplet temperature between a <b>copper</b> <b>coated</b> and uncoated welding wire. This increase in temperature would lead to a higher evaporation rate with a resultant increase in the FFR. The thesis explores possible reasons for an increase in temperature...|$|R

The effect of physical damage on <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> performance was confirmed. The test {{data suggest that}} ohmic heating {{is the main reason}} for thin (less than 1 mmφ) <b>copper</b> <b>wire</b> breakage in the experiments. However, the magnetic force and skin effect are primarily responsible for breaking thick <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> rather than thermal failure, as previously thought. When the thick curved <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> were impressed by the lightning impulse current, they deformed into “heart ” shape before they are broken. We used FEM software to simulate the deforming process when the curved <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> carried the lightning impulse current. And the experimental and simulation results are in some degree agreement. Next we used the FEM software to analyze the temperature distribution of curved <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> under heave current. Fig. 1 Experimental circui...|$|R
40|$|Oil-impregnated {{paper is}} widely used in power {{transmission}} equipment as a reliable insulation. However, copper sulphide deposition on oil-paper insulation can lead to insulation failures in power transformers. This paper presents the influences of copper sulfur corrosion and copper sulphide deposition on <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> and oil-paper insulation in power transformers. Thermal aging tests of paper-wrapped <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> and bare <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> in insulating oil were carried out at 130 °C and 150 °C in laboratory. The corrosive characteristics of paper-wrapped <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> and bare <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> were analyzed. Dielectric properties of insulation paper and insulating oil were also analyzed {{at different stages of}} the thermal aging tests using a broadband dielectric spectrometer. Experiments and analysis results show that copper sulfide deposition on surfaces of <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> and insulation paper changes the surface structures of <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> and insulation paper. Copper sulfur corrosion changes the dielectric properties of oil-paper insulation, and the copper sulfide deposition greatly reduces the electrical breakdown strength of oil-paper insulation. Metal passivator is capable of preventing <b>copper</b> <b>wires</b> from sulfur corrosion. The experimental results are helpful for investigations for fault diagnosis of internal insulation in power transformers...|$|R
