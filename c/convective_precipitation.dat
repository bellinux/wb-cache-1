5|$|The {{first stage}} of a {{thunderstorm}} is the cumulus stage or developing stage. During this stage, masses of moisture are lifted upwards into the atmosphere. The trigger for this lift can be solar illumination, where the heating of the ground produces thermals, or where two winds converge forcing air upwards, or where winds blow over terrain of increasing elevation. The moisture carried upward cools into liquid drops of water due to lower temperatures at high altitude, which appear as cumulus clouds. As the water vapor condenses into liquid, latent heat is released, which warms the air, causing it to become less dense than the surrounding, drier air. The air tends to rise in an updraft {{through the process of}} convection (hence the term <b>convective</b> <b>precipitation).</b> This process creates a low-pressure zone within and beneath the forming thunderstorm. In a typical thunderstorm, approximately 500 million kilograms of water vapor are lifted into the Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
500|$|Fronts are the {{principal}} cause of significant weather. <b>Convective</b> <b>precipitation</b> (showers, thundershowers, and related unstable weather) is caused by air being lifted and condensing into clouds by {{the movement of the}} cold front or cold occlusion under a mass of warmer, moist air.

40|$|Title: Frequency {{analysis}} of precipitation amounts Author: Mgr. Zuzana Rulfová Department: Department of Atmospheric Physics Supervisor: RNDr. Jan Kyselý, Ph. D., Institute of Atmospheric Physics CAS Abstract: This thesis deals with analysing characteristics of mean and extreme precipitation in observations and regional climate models (RCMs) {{with respect to}} their convective and stratiform origin. An algorithm for subdivision of precipitation amounts into predominantly convective and stratiform using station weather data is proposed and evaluated. The time series of <b>convective</b> and stratiform <b>precipitation</b> from the Czech Republic over 1982 - 2010 are used for analysing basic climatological characteristics of precipitation, including extremes, and evaluating RCMs from the ENSEMBLES project. Projected changes of <b>convective</b> and stratiform <b>precipitation</b> in Central Europe (the Czech Republic) are analysed using data from RCM simulations from the EURO-CORDEX project. The last part of the thesis introduces a new statistical model for analysing precipitation extremes. This model takes advantage from knowledge of origin of precipitation extremes. In future climate we could expect more <b>convective</b> and stratiform <b>precipitation</b> amounts in all seasons except summer, when climate models project decline in amounts of stratiform [...] ...|$|R
500|$|Rainbands {{in advance}} of warm {{occluded}} fronts and warm fronts are associated with weak upward motion, and tend to be wide and stratiform in nature. [...] In an atmosphere with rich low level moisture and vertical wind shear, narrow, convective rainbands known as squall lines generally in the cyclone's warm sector, ahead of strong cold fronts associated with extratropical cyclones. [...] Wider rain bands can occur behind cold fronts, which {{tend to have more}} stratiform, and less <b>convective,</b> <b>precipitation.</b> [...] Within the cold sector north to northwest of a cyclone center, in colder cyclones, small scale, or mesoscale, bands of heavy snow can occur within a cyclone's comma head precipitation pattern with a width of [...] to [...] [...] These bands in the comma head are associated with areas of frontogensis, or zones of strengthening temperature contrast. [...] Southwest of extratropical cyclones, curved flow bringing cold air across the relatively warm Great Lakes can lead to narrow lake effect snow bands which bring significant localized snowfall.|$|E
500|$|Stratiform (a broad {{shield of}} {{precipitation}} {{with a relatively}} similar intensity) and dynamic precipitation (<b>convective</b> <b>precipitation</b> which is showery in nature with large changes in intensity over short distances) occur {{as a consequence of}} slow ascent of air in synoptic systems (on the order of cm/s), such as in the vicinity of cold fronts and near and poleward of surface warm fronts. Similar ascent is seen around tropical cyclones outside of the eyewall, and in comma-head precipitation patterns around mid-latitude cyclones. A wide variety of weather can be found along an occluded front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low-pressure areas. What separates rainfall from other precipitation types, such as ice pellets and snow, is the presence of a thick layer of air aloft which is above the melting point of water, which melts the frozen precipitation well before it reaches the ground. If there is a shallow near surface layer that is below freezing, freezing rain (rain which freezes on contact with surfaces in subfreezing environments) will result. Hail becomes an increasingly infrequent occurrence when the freezing level within the atmosphere exceeds [...] above ground level.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{precipitation}} {{records are}} based on a measured depth of water received within a fixed time interval. [...] Frequency of a precipitation threshold of interest may be determined from the number of measurements exceeding that threshold value within the total time period for which observations are available. [...] Individual data points are converted to intensity by dividing each measured depth by the period of time between observations. [...] This intensity will be less than the actual peak intensity if the duration of the rainfall event was less than the fixed time interval for which measurements are reported. [...] <b>Convective</b> <b>precipitation</b> events (thunderstorms) tend to produce shorter duration storm events than orographic precipitation. [...] Duration, intensity, and frequency of rainfall events are important to flood prediction. [...] Short duration precipitation is more significant to flooding within small drainage basins.|$|E

40|$|Multi-frequency {{range imaging}} (RIM) has been {{implemented}} in the Chung-Li very-high-frequency (VHF) radar, located {{on the campus of}} National Central University, Taiwan, since 2008. RIM processes the echo signals with a group of closely spaced transmitting frequencies through appropriate inversion methods to obtain high-resolution distribution of echo power in the range direction. This is beneficial to the investigation of the small scale structure embedded in dynamic atmosphere. Five transmitting frequencies were employed in the radar experiment for observation of the precipitating atmosphere during the period between 21 and 23 Aug, 2013. Using the Capon and Fourier methods, the radar echoes were synthesized to retrieve the temporal signals at a smaller range step than the original range resolution defined by the pulse width, and such retrieved temporal signals were then processed in the Doppler frequency domain to identify the atmosphere and precipitation echoes. An analysis called conditional averaging was further executed for echo power, Doppler velocity, and spectral width to verify the potential capabilities of the retrieval processing in resolving small-scale precipitation and atmosphere structures. Point-by-point correction of range delay combined with compensation of range weighting function effect has been performed during the retrieval of temporal signals to improve the continuity of power spectra at gate boundaries, making the small-scale structures in the power spectra more natural and reasonable. We examined stratiform and <b>convective</b> <b>precipitations</b> and demonstrated their different structured characteristics by means of the Capon-processed results...|$|R
30|$|To {{start from}} a {{relatively}} simple factor, we first inspected the moisture budget, as shown in Fig.  9. Most of the parameters were obtained via the thermodynamic budget analyses, except LP in Fig. 9 a; LP is the precipitation and is identical to that in Fig. 5 c (by utilizing TRMM 3 B 42), but converted to units of heat by multiplying by the constant of latent heating L.

2500|$|Rapid {{flooding}} events, including flash floods, {{more often}} occur on smaller rivers, rivers with steep valleys, rivers that flow {{for much of}} their length over impermeable terrain, or normally-dry channels.

In one instance, a flash flood killed eight people enjoying the water on a Sunday afternoon at a popular waterfall in a narrow canyon. Without any observed rainfall, the flow rate increased from about [...] in just one minute. Two larger floods occurred at the same site within a week, {{but no one was}} at the waterfall on those days.

40|$|Convective {{processes}} play {{a critical}} role in the Earth’s energy balance through the redistribution of heat and moisture in the atmosphere and subsequent impacts on the hydrologic cycle. Global observation and accurate representation of these processes in numerical models is vital to improving our current understanding and future simulations of Earth’s climate system. Despite improvements in computing power, current operational weather and global climate models are unable to resolve the natural temporal and spatial scales that are associated with <b>convective</b> and stratiform <b>precipitation</b> processes; therefore, they must turn to parameterization schemes to represent these processes. In turn, the physical basis for these parameterization schemes needs to be evaluated for general application under a variety of atmospheric conditions. Analogously, space-based remote sensing algorithms designed to retrieve related cloud and precipitation information for use in hydrological, climate, and numerical weather prediction applications often rely on physical “parameterizations” that reliably translate indirectly related instrument measurements to the physical quantity of interest (e. g., precipitation rate). Importantly, both spaceborne retrieval algorithms and model convective parameterization schemes traditionally rely on field campaign data sets as a basis for evaluating and improving the physics of their respective approaches. The Midlatitude Continental Convective Clouds Experiment (MC 3 E) will take place in central Oklahoma during the April–May 2011 period. The experiment is a collaborative effort between the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Climate Research Facility and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission Ground Validation (GV) program. The field campaign leverages the unprecedented observing infrastructure currently available in the central United States, combined with an extensive sounding array, remote sensing and in situ aircraft observations, NASA GPM ground validation remote sensors, and new ARM instrumentation purchased with American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funding.
