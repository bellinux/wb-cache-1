5|$|Some spiders have a <b>cribellum,</b> a {{modified}} spinneret {{with up to}} 40,000 spigots, each of which produces a single very fine fiber. The fibers are pulled out by the calamistrum, a comb-like set of bristles on the jointed tip of the <b>cribellum,</b> and combined into a composite woolly thread that is very effective in snagging the bristles of insects. The earliest spiders had cribella, which produced the first silk capable of capturing insects, before spiders developed silk coated with sticky droplets. However, most modern groups of spiders have lost the <b>cribellum.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>cribellum</b> is a silk {{spinning}} organ {{found in}} certain spiders. Unlike normal spinnerets, the <b>cribellum</b> consists {{of one or}} more plates covered in thousands of tiny spigots. These spigots produce extremely fine fibers which are combed out by the spider's calamistrum, producing silk with a woolly texture. The fibers are so small in diameter that prey insects easily become entangled in them, without any glue needed. The spiders then bite them before they can escape. The <b>cribellum</b> is a functional homolog of the anterior median spinnerets of Mesothelae and Mygalomorphae, which do not have a <b>cribellum.</b>|$|E
25|$|The outside {{layer of}} a diatom is also called a <b>cribellum.</b> It {{consists}} of a thin siliceous membrane covered with small pores.|$|E
25|$|The abdomen has no {{appendages}} except {{from one}} to four (usually three) modified pairs of movable telescoping organs called spinnerets, which produce silk. Originally, the common ancestor of spiders had four pairs of spinnerets, with two pairs on the tenth body segment and two pairs on the eleventh body segment, located in the middle on the ventral side of the abdomen. The suborder Mesothelae is unique in having only two types of silk glands â€“ {{thought to be the}} ancestral condition. All other spiders have the spinnerets further towards the posterior end of the body where they form a small cluster, and the anterior central spinnerets on the tenth segment are lost or reduced (suborder Mygalomorphae), or modified into a specialised and flattened plate called the <b>cribellum</b> (suborder Araneomorphae). The <b>cribellum</b> (usually separated into a left and a right half) produces a thread made up of hundreds to thousands of very fine dry silk fibers (about 10nm thick) around a few thicker core fibers, which then are combed into a woolly structure by using a group of specialized hairs (setae) on their fourth pair of legs. It is suspected their woolly silk is charged with static electricity, causing its fine fibres to attach to trapped prey. Once all araneomorph (modern) spiders had a <b>cribellum,</b> but today it only remains in the cribellate spiders (although it is sometimes missing even here), which are widespread around the world. Often, this plate lacks the ability to produce silk, and is then called the colulus; an organ that zoologists have not identified a function for. The colulus is reduced or absent in most species. The cribellate spiders were the first spiders to build specialized prey catching webs, later evolving into groups that used the spinnerets solely to make webs, instead using silk threads dotted with droplets of a sticky liquid (like pearls on a necklace) to capture small arthropods, and a few large species even small bats and birds. Other spiders do not build webs at all, but have become active hunters, like the highly successful jumping spiders.|$|E
2500|$|The {{presence}} or absence of a <b>cribellum</b> is used to classify araneomorph spiders into the cribellate and ecribellate (not cribellate) type. The distinction can be used to study evolutionary relationships. However, in 1967 it was discovered that there are many families with both cribellate and ecribellate members (Lehtinen, 1967). Today, it is believed that the precursor of all Araneomorphae was cribellate (symplesiomorphy), and that this function was lost in some araneomorph spiders secondarily (Coddington & Levy, 1991). Many of these still retain a colulus, which is thought to be a reduced <b>cribellum,</b> and is of unknown function. However, some [...] "ecribellate" [...] spiders seem to have evolved independently, without cribellate precursors (Foelix, 1979). In Austrochilidae, the <b>cribellum</b> is developed only in the second nymphal stage, so the ecribellate and cribellate conditions change during the spider ontogenesis.|$|E
2500|$|The {{southern}} house spider is a cribellate spider. That is, its spinnerets do {{not produce}} adhesive webbing. [...] Instead, to capture prey the spider uses its legs to comb webbing across its <b>cribellum,</b> a spiked plate near the spinnerets. This combing action frays and tangles the strands, producing a fine, velcro-like netting that ensnares insect legs.|$|E

50|$|Although cribellate and non-cribellate orb weavers {{had earlier}} {{been placed in}} the same taxon (from at least 1789), the two kinds of orb weaver were placed in {{separate}} taxa after the possession of a <b>cribellum</b> was prioritized over {{the form of the}} web. Following John Blackwall in 1841 and Philipp Bertkau in 1878, for a long time the majority of araneologists accepted spiders with a <b>cribellum</b> as a coherent taxon, Cribellatae. Many also held that cribellate and ecribellate spiders had separately evolved orb webs from other kinds of web. By the early 1970s, it had become apparent that cribellate spiders were a paraphyletic group, the <b>cribellum</b> being an ancient feature of araneomorph spiders that had been lost in many descendants, so that grouping spiders together based on the retention of this feature did not produce a monophyletic taxon.|$|E

50|$|In spiders, the calamistrum is {{a row of}} {{specialized}} leg bristles used to comb out fine bands of silk. It is only found on cribellate spiders, that is, spiders that possess the spinning organ known as the <b>cribellum.</b> The calamistrum and <b>cribellum</b> are used to form the hackled bands of silk which are characteristic of the webs of these spiders. The calamistrum is found on the upper margin of the metatarsus of the hind legs. Each bristle of the calamistrum is serrated {{on one side and}} smooth on the other.|$|E
50|$|Uroctea is a genus of spiders that {{is found}} in Eurasia and Africa. It is {{sometimes}} put into its own family, Urocteidae. Their tent-like web {{is very similar to}} the ones Oecobius builds; but Uroctea species do not have a <b>cribellum.</b>|$|E
50|$|The family Pacullidae {{contains}} three-clawed spiders {{with six}} eyes, lacking a <b>cribellum.</b> They resemble spiders {{from the family}} Tetrablemmidae in some respects but are much larger, always exceeding 5 mm long, have a very wrinkled (rugose) cuticle, and females do not have large membranous receptacles.|$|E
5000|$|Synspermiata is a clade of araneomorph spiders, {{comprising}} most of {{the former}} [...] "haplogynes". They are united by having simpler genitalia than other araneomorph spiders, lacking a <b>cribellum,</b> and sharing an evolutionary history of synspermia - a particular way in which spermatozoa are grouped together when transferred to the female.|$|E

50|$|The two families, Deinopoidea and Araneoidea, {{have similar}} {{behavioral}} sequences and spinning apparatuses to produce architecturally similar webs. The Araneidae weave true viscid silk with an aqueous glue property, and the Deinopoidea use dry fibrils and sticky silk. The Deinopoidea (including the Uloboridae), have a <b>cribellum</b> - a flat, complex spinning plate {{from which the}} cribellate silk is released.|$|E
50|$|Uloborus plumipes is a {{cribellate spider}} with a <b>cribellum,</b> a silk {{spinning}} organ {{which consists of}} one or more plates covered in thousands of tiny spigots. The fine fibres produced are combined by comblike bristles on the hind legs into slender silk threads with a fuzzy texture that are able to trap prey without the use of glue.|$|E
50|$|In Australia, {{they are}} small to {{medium-sized}} entelgyne spiders with generous sheet webs {{across the floor}} of rainforests. They generally have eight similar eyes in two conservatively curved rows. They often have a calamistrum on metatarsus IV associated with a <b>cribellum.</b> Australian amaurobiids may be distinguished from the Amphinectidae {{by the absence of}} a pretarsal fracture and the presence of a retrocoxal hymen on coxa I.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, Peter Michalik and MartÃ­n RamÃ­rez {{published}} {{a study of}} the morphology of the reproductive system of male spiders, including their spermatozoa. They found a clade within haplogyne spiders, Synspermatia, characterized by the absence of a <b>cribellum</b> and the synapomorphy (shared derived character) of synspermia. Not all members of the clade exhibit synspermia, since it has evolved into cleistospermia multiple times and Telemidae have individually encapsulated sperm cells arranged in densely packed stacks.|$|E
50|$|Hypochilus thorelli {{was first}} {{described}} by George Marx in 1888, the genus Hypochilus being erected for this purpose. The genus name {{is derived from}} the Greek hypo, below, and cheilos, lip, referring to the position of the labium. The species name honours Tamerlan Thorell. The unique combination of features - four book lungs like mygalomorph spiders but a <b>cribellum</b> like araneomorph spiders - led to Marx placing it in not only a new genus but also a new family, Hypochilidae.|$|E
50|$|Spiders of {{this family}} are very small, usually less than two {{millimeters}} long, and lack a <b>cribellum.</b> They can have either six or eight eyes, the rear median eyes either reduced or missing. The carapace is modified so that the eyes are raised higher than usual. Color can range from reddish brown to yellowish brown. Both margins of chelicerae have teeth. The legs are short and spineless. The labium has a spur that extends between the chelicerae and can be seen when the chelicerae are spread.|$|E
5000|$|Like the [...] "primitive" [...] {{suborder}} of spiders Mesothelae, {{they have}} two pairs of book lungs, and downward pointing chelicerae. Because of this, {{the two groups were}} once believed to be closely related. Later it was realized that the common ancestors of all spiders had these features (a state known as symplesiomorphy). Following the branching into the suborders of Mesothelae and Opisthothelae, the mygalomorphs retained them, while their fellow Opisthothelae members, the araneomorphs, evolved new [...] "modern" [...] features, including a <b>cribellum</b> and cross-acting fangs.|$|E
50|$|Wall spider is {{the common}} name {{for members of the}} genus Oecobius. The members of these several species are all very small spiders that make small flat webs over crevices in walls and in similar spaces. They possess an organ called a <b>cribellum,</b> which is a kind of comb-like device used to {{separate}} fibers of silk drawn from its spinnerets into many extremely fine fibers. Those fibers are so small in diameter that prey insects easily become entangled in them. The spiders then bite them before they can get away.|$|E
50|$|This {{still leaves}} open {{questions}} {{relating to the}} origin of the orb web. Did it evolve only once, with araneids later losing the <b>cribellum</b> (and hence cribellate silk), or did it evolve separately in uloborids and araneids? If it evolved only once, how early did this happen in the evolutionary history of entelegyne spiders? If late, then uloborids and araneids may form a monophyletic group, Orbiculariae. If very early, then uloborids and ananeids may not be closely related, and many more araneoids that do not spin webs would have lost this ability secondarily.|$|E
50|$|Along with Progradungula carraiensis and Macrogradungula moonya, odd-clawed spiders {{are one of}} {{the only}} three species {{belonging}} to the family Gradungulidae that are cribellate. Unlike other members of the family which are all cursorial (active roving hunters), these three species are ambush predators that construct snares. The snares are made from silk spun from specialized spinnerets known as the <b>cribellum,</b> and combed with the row of bristles (the calamistrum) on their fourth leg pair. Unlike normal spinnerets, the <b>cribellum</b> produces extremely fine silk that can easily entangle prey without the need for glue. The snares of all three species are distinctively ladder-shaped, in contrast to the snares of other cribellate spiders from other families.The larger part of the odd-clawed spider's web is composed of a network of supporting threads built up to 2 m above the ground. Two lateral support threads extend from this network and are attached to vegetation or ground below. These threads are held more or less parallel to each other by several short bridge threads. The spider spins the catching ladder in between them, composed of a loose irregular zigzag of cribellate thread. The catching ladder and the supporting webs are usually built far from the retreat of the spider in the tree hollows, as far as 3 m away. The retreat and the webs are connected to each other by a single sturdy thread.|$|E
