Examples include links associated with network interfaces on a host computer, or downstream and upstream channels within a DOCSIS cable modem connection. <b>Channel</b> <b>bonding</b> is differentiated from load balancing in that load balancing divides traffic between network interfaces on per network socket (OSI model layer 4) basis, while <b>channel</b> <b>bonding</b> implies a division of traffic between physical interfaces at a lower level, either per packet (OSI model Layer 3) or a data link (OSI model Layer 2) basis.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an optofluidic droplet interrogation device capable of counting fluorescent drops at a throughput of 254000 drops per second. To our knowledge, this rate {{is the highest}} interrogation rate published thus far. Our device consists of 16 parallel microfluidic <b>channels</b> <b>bonded</b> directly to a filter-coated two-dimensional Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) sensor array. Fluorescence signals emitted from the drops are collected by the sensor that forms {{the bottom of the}} channel. The proximity of the drops to the sensor facilitates efficient collection of fluorescence emission from the drops, and overcomes the trade-off between light collection efficiency and field of view in conventional microscopy. The interrogation rate of our device is currently limited by the acquisition speed of CMOS sensor, and is expected to increase further as high-speed sensors become increasingly available...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the design, expected performance, and preliminary test {{results of a}} contact-cooled monochromator for use on high heat load x-ray beamlines.

As such, for the present application, it is compatible with the best internally cooled crystal monochromators. There are three key features in the design of this monochromator. First, it is contact cooled, thereby eliminating fabrication of cooling <b>channels,</b> <b>bonding,</b> and undesirable strains in the monochromator due to coolant-manifold-to-crystal-interface. Second, by illuminating the entire length of the crystal and extracting the central part of the reflected beam, sharp slope changes in the beam profile and thus slope errors are avoided.
