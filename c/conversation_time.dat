Basic building modules of classical call centers – a switching system {{and a group of}} humans agents – was extended with other special modules such as skills-based routing module, automatic call distribution module, interactive voice response module and others to minimize the customer waiting time and wage costs. A calling customer of a modern call center is served in the first stage by the interactive voice response module without any human interaction. If the customer requirements are not satisfied in the first stage, the service continues to the second stage realized by the group of human agents.

This article first explores the origins of gossip as a mechanism for bonding social groups, tracing these origins back to social grooming among primates.

Finally, the author reviews briefly the role of social cognition in facilitating conversations of this kind. For reasons that are not entirely clear, gossip has acquired a decidedly shady reputation. It is seen as malicious, destructive, and largely rep-rehensible. Describing a person as an “old gos-sip ” implies someone with more time on their hands than they know what to do with, to...|$|E

This study investigates whether five minutes of conversation between two players who did not know each other prompts them to contribute more money to a shared account in a two-player cooperation game. In the game, public good is maximized if both players put everything in the shared account, but choosing to keep some money in a player’s personal account often results in higher personal gains. We hypothesized that <b>conversation</b> <b>time</b> would lead to decreased social distance and greater shared account contributions, but our results did not show {{a significant difference in the}} group of players that conversed before playing.

40|$|Public access mobile radio systems (PAMR) using {{trunking}} technology {{allow more}} {{efficient use of}} the frequency spectrum, as all the users of the system jointly use a common pool of channels. Trunked PAMR systems can operate on two different levels of management, {{on the basis of}} messages (message trunking) and transmissions (transmission trunking). When using message trunking, the system allocates the radio channel from the beginning {{to the end of the}} conversation. However, with transmission trunking, the system allocates a radio channel when one partner presses his or her push-to-talk button (PTT) and deallocates the radio channel when he or she releases the PTT button to change talking partners. Thus, during the silence produced by this change, no channel is occupied. The advantage of transmission trunking is that there is no waste of channel occupancy during the pauses in the conversation. The drawback is that a more complex control system with more signalling is needed, where the distribution of the transmission occupancy is more crucial in the performance than in the distribution of the message holding time when trunking by message. In message trunking, the lack of radio channel only causes a delay and the user has to wait to begin the conversation, while in transmission trunking, it can produce an unpleasant effect of clipped words. This paper verifies that voice calls, generally assumed to have an exponential holding time, are better modelled with other distributions, and analyses the statistical properties of the <b>conversation</b> <b>time</b> in two different PAMR systems (13 refs.)

40|$|Background: The {{success of}} {{periodontal}} therapy {{depends on the}} adherence of patients to professional recommendations. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the influence of a workshop in Motivational Interviewing (MI) on non-surgical periodontal treatment performed by dental students. Material and Methods: In the experimental group patients with periodontitis were treated by students trained in MI, while in the control group patients were treated by students who had not been trained in MI. Clinical oral parameters were assessed by a blinded periodontist in addition to the evaluation of psychological questionnaires given before and after the non-surgical periodontal treatment (six months). Conversations between patients and students were recorded and rated with the Motivational Treatment Integrity Code (MITI-d) by a blinded psychologist. Results: There were 73 patients in the MI group and 99 patients in the control group. The MI group showed significantly higher scores in the MITI-d analysis. Regression analysis showed that there were no significant differences between groups with regard to plaque level, gingival bleeding, pocket depth reduction or bleeding upon probing. However, patients in the MI-group showed significantly higher interdental cleaning self-efficacy than patients in the control group (MI= 19. 57 +/- 4. 7; control= 17. 38 +/- 6. 01; p= 0. 016). Conclusions: Teaching MI to dental students resulted in a significant improvement in the self-efficacy of interdental cleaning in patients compared to a control group of non-trained students, but no improvement in other aspects of non-surgical periodontal therapy. The study also showed that an eight-hour workshop with supervision significantly improved the MI-compliant conversations of dental students without requiring more <b>conversation</b> <b>time...</b>|$|E
40|$|The diploma work titled Cooperation {{between the}} school and the parents as an element of the quality of school explores the problem of quality {{assessment}} and assurance of cooperation between teachers and parents at the special school with lower educational standard. Basic theoretical background in the fields of quality, evaluation and participation in the educational process, contribute to the understanding and implementation of research results. The research part of the study, based on a qualitative analysis of two questionnaires for parents and teachers, examines the organization and attendance of various forms of cooperation, parents’ opportunities to influence on the school life and the frequency of their expression of opinions, suggestions and comments. Also, study explains the impact of working experience and personal qualities of teachers on organization of various forms of cooperation. The results show that the educators with more experiences organize more forms of cooperation with parents and that the parents in those groups evaluate better their affect on the life in school. As a good form of cooperation parents specify an individual <b>conversation</b> <b>time,</b> where they obtain more information about their children. That is why daily contacts and special consulting hours are gaining in importance. Building a partnership requires open and honest communication, which is flowing in more relaxed forms of cooperation. In those parents have formed a more active role. The findings relate to a specific school, and therefore can not be generalized to other educational institutions, but may contribute to further research in this area, improving the concrete practice in the studied institution, the implementation of similar approaches in other organizations and comparisons between them. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this study has been to develop new knowledge about how school parents experience the meeting with the school through the parent conferences. This conversation between teacher, parents and pupil is required for all primary schools in Norway by law to implement twice a year, for at least 20 minutes each time. Six parents of children in second, fifth and ninth grade have shared their experience with me through qualitative research interviews. Five informants were mothers, while one was a father. The interviews were conducted in neutral places, such as library, café and assembly hall, and the informants volunteered after I had informed about the project in parent meetings in different schools. The analysis mainly consisted of the following steps: transcription and structuring, simplifying and focusing, organizing and categorizing, and finally; drawing conclusions and returning quotations into the data set. The main finding in this project is that parents look forward to, and give priority to, participating in the parent conferences. They emphasize that the parent conference {{is a very important}} arena for the collaboration with the school. None of the informants state that they usually share academic inputs with the teacher during the parent conferences, or even discuss teaching methods or ideas with the teacher. My main impression is that the parents tend to believe that teachers are professionals in teaching matters, who do not need perspectives or ideas from the parents. When asked to picture the ideal parent conference, all informants state that they would like more dialogue-time with the teacher during the school year. All informants tell that, due to the child's presence in the conference, it feels strange and unnatural to discuss difficult topics. The informants prefer that some of the conference was held without the child participating. While working with this project, I have also gotten a view on how the parents experience the cooperation with the school in general. Roughly, I find that the informants hold the collaboration with the school as important, and the parent conference stands out as the most prioritied arena, from the home's perspective. When gathering the findings in this study, I have identified some main criteria which the parents point out to be vital for the parent conference's success. These criteria are: the organizing of the conference takes into account the parents' life situation, right focus in the dialogue, the teacher's conduct in the dialogue, and the disposition of the <b>conversation</b> <b>time...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to (a) explain the doctor-patient relationship and communication in Chinese cultural context, and (b) investigate the differences and similarities in doctors 2 ̆ 7 communication styles, patient autonomy, patient satisfaction and their relations across two cultures. ^ Study One is a qualitative exploration on doctor-patient communication in China using cultural centered approach. Twenty six participants from different cities and provinces of China were recruited for in-depth interviews. The researcher also spent several weeks visiting and observing in hospital and doctors 2 ̆ 7 offices in China. ^ Study One discovered several themes coming out from the interviews. These themes examined how trust was established between doctors and patients in China, and how doctor-patients communication/relationship was established in different hospitals and different medical philosophies. Results showed that: (a) Trust in doctors mostly relied on word-of-mouth communication, and trust was usually generated from patients 2 ̆ 7 close friends, relatives, and existing social networks; (b) Complaints generally were not useful. Compensation and first-time relationships were established through {{the social and cultural}} meaning of “Hong Bao (Red envelope) ”; (c) The patients generally wanted doctors to make decisions for them, and elders usually wanted to make decision together with their family, however, when making big decisions or release results, doctors usually reported to and consult with the patients 2 ̆ 7 family members first; (d) Traditional Chinese medicine doctors had better communication skills and establish a long term relationship with patients; Lack of information transmission and lack of respect in communication lead to patients‘ dissatisfaction; (e) Patient dissatisfaction comes from expensive fees, disparity of healthcare resources, lack of communication skills, especially lack of privacy, respect, cold attitude and lack of protection of patients‘ right; patients satisfaction were also different between private hospitals and state-owned hospitals. ^ Study Two is a cross-cultural comparative study examines the doctors‘ communication styles and how the styles and other social variables influence patient satisfaction. 1097 Chinese (562 men and 534 women) and 1280 Americans (515 men and 765 women) were recruited for finishing a survey questionnaire on patient satisfaction and doctors‘ communication styles. The study demonstrated that the Chinese patients perceived more control communication styles and less affiliation communication styles from doctors than American patients. One of the most important findings is Chinese patients perceive more dominance communication style from their doctors as satisfying while the Americans perceive less dominance communication styles as satisfying. The study also found significant effect of waiting time and <b>conversation</b> <b>time</b> has significant effect on patient communication satisfaction and Healthcare satisfaction. A revised model was proposed based on the finding of the research. ^ Overall, the results of Study Two showed some similarities in doctor-patient communication styles and the relation between the time and most communication styles, with patient satisfaction in both china and the United States. Meanwhile, Study One provides lots of context and details in doctor-patient communication and patient satisfaction in China, which the comparative study lacks. Implications and limitations of the two studies‘ findings, as well as directions for future research were discussed. ...|$|E
