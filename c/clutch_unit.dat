40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an under-actuated model of human walking, {{comprising}} only a soleus muscle and flexion/extension monoarticular hip muscles. The remaining muscle {{groups of the}} human leg are modeled using quasi-passive, series-elastic clutch elements.

As {{an evaluation of the}} musculoskeletal model, we vary model parameters, or spring constants, and muscle control parameters using an optimization scheme that maximizes walking distance and minimizes the mechanical economy of walking. We used a positive force feedback reflex control for the model's soleus muscle, and upper body position control for the hip muscles. The model's clutches were engaged/disengaged using simple state machine controllers. For model evaluation, a forward dynamics simulation was conducted, and the resulting mechanics were compared to human walking data. The model makes qualitative predictions of joint mechanics, electromyography and mechanical economy...|$|R

5000|$|This type of clutch {{has several}} driving members {{interleaved}} or [...] "stacked" [...] with several driven members. It {{is used in}} racing cars including Formula 1, IndyCar, World Rally and even most club racing. Multiplate clutches see much use in drag racing, which requires the best acceleration possible, and is notorious for the abuse the clutch is subjected to. Thus motorcycles, automatic transmissions and in some diesel locomotives with mechanical transmissions. It is also used in some electronically controlled all-wheel drive systems {{as well as in}} some transfer cases. They can also be found in some heavy machinery such as tanks and AFV's (T-54) and earthmoving equipment (front-end loaders, bulldozers), as well as components in certain types of limited slip differentials. The benefit in the case of motorsports is that you can achieve the same total friction force with a much smaller overall diameter (or conversely, a much greater friction force for the same diameter, important in cases where a vehicle is modified with greater power, yet the maximum physical size of the <b>clutch</b> <b>unit</b> is constrained by the clutch housing). In motorsports vehicles that run at high engine/drivetrain speeds, the smaller diameter reduces rotational inertia, making the drivetrain components accelerate more rapidly, as well as reducing the angular velocity of the outer areas of the <b>clutch</b> <b>unit,</b> which could become highly stressed and fail at the extremely high drivetrain rotational rates achieved in sports such as Formula 1 or drag racing. In the case of heavy equipment, which often deal with very high torque forces and drivetrain loads, a single plate clutch of the necessary strength would be too large to easily package as a component of the driveline.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} focused on {{power-assisted}} wheelchairs because they have several advantages related to both manual and electric powered wheelchairs. They provide users with exercise for rehabilitation and reduce the user’s physical fatigue by providing electric assistance. However, if the assist function is too strong, the effect of exercise may be decreased, and it may cause the weight heavy. Conversely, if it is too weak, the effect of the physical assistance may be insufficient. In this study, the wheelchair driving mechanism is modeled, and the appropriate motor power is chosen based on the computer simulation. For the driving experiments, the wheelchair is developed with in-wheel type electric assist wheels, which can be detached from the wheelchair body, and supports the manual driving mode with a <b>clutch</b> <b>unit.</b> In the experiments, the performance of the developed pushrim-activated power-assisted wheelchair is shown to be close to the proposed design specifications...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{mechanical}} behavior of leg muscles and tendons during human walking {{in order to}} motivate the design of economical robotic legs. We hypothesize that quasi-passive, series-elastic <b>clutch</b> <b>units</b> spanning the knee joint in a musculoskeletal arrangement can capture the dominant mechanical behaviors of the human knee in level-ground walking. Since the mechanical work done by the knee joint throughout a level-ground self-selected-speed walking cycle is negative, and {{since there is no}} element capable of dissipating mechanical energy in the musculoskeletal model, biarticular elements would necessarily need to transfer energy from the knee joint to hip and/or ankle joints. This mechanism would reduce the necessary actuator work and improve the mechanical economy of a human-like walking robot. As a preliminary evaluation of these hypotheses, we vary model parameters, or spring constants and clutch engagement times, using an optimization scheme that minimizes ankle and hip actuator positive work while still maintaining human-like knee mechanics. For model evaluation, kinetic and kinematic gait data were employed from one study participant walking across a level-ground surface at a self-selected gait speed. With this under-actuated leg model, we find good agreement between the model's quasi-passive knee torque and experimental knee values, suggesting that a knee actuator is not necessary for level-ground robotic ambulation at self-selected gait speeds...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} motivate {{the design of}} legged {{machines}} that walk as humans do, this thesis investigates how leg muscles and tendons work mechanically during level-ground human walking at self-selected speeds. I hypothesize that quasi- passive, series-elastic <b>clutch</b> <b>units</b> spanning the knee joint in a musculoskeletal arrangement can capture the dominant mechanical behaviors of the human knee in level-ground walking. As a preliminary evaluation of this hypothesis, I develop an under-actuated model of the human leg in walking where each muscle-tendon unit spanning the knee joint is represented as a simple linear spring in series with a clutch. I vary model parameters, or spring constants and clutch engagement times, using an optimization scheme that minimizes ankle and hip actuator work while still maintaining human-like knee mechanics. For model evaluation, kinetic and kinematic gait data are employed from nine participants walking across a level-ground surface at self-selected gait speeds. With this under-actuated leg model, I find good agreement between model quasi-passive knee torque and experimental knee values, suggesting that a knee actuator is not necessary for level-ground robotic ambulation at self-selected gait speeds. As a further evaluation of the hypothesis of spring-like muscle-tendon behavior about the knee joint, a forward dynamics control scheme for the under-actuated model is developed. Hill-type muscle models are employed to model the ankle soleus and hip monoarticular muscles. Further, the model's series-elastic clutches are engaged with a simple state machine based on electromyography (EMG) data from the literature. Muscles are controlled with simple feedback controls representing the reflexive architecture of the human neuromuscular system. Following an optimization procedure, the model is shown to predict joint and muscle biomechanics, {{as well as the}} metabolism of walking humans, supporting the idea that muscle-tendon units spanning the human knee joint mainly operate as spring elements during neural activation, affording the relatively high metabolic walking economy of humans. by Ken Endo.

40|$|The {{loss of a}} limb is {{extremely}} debilitating. Unfortunately, today's assistive technologies are still far from providing fully functional artificial limb replacements. Although lower extremity prostheses are currently better able to give assistance than their upper-extremity counterparts, important locomotion problems still remain for leg amputees. Instability, gait asymmetry, decreased walking speeds and high metabolic energy costs {{are some of the}} main challenges requiring {{the development of a new}} kind of prosthetic device. These challenges point to the need for highly versatile, fully integrated lower-extremity powered prostheses that can replicate the biological behavior of the intact human leg. This thesis presents the design and evaluation of a novel biomimetic active knee prosthesis capable of emulating intact knee biomechanics during level-ground walking. The knee design is motivated by a mono-articular prosthetic knee model comprised of a variable damper and two series elastic <b>clutch</b> <b>units</b> spanning the knee joint. The powered knee system is comprised of two series-elastic actuators positioned in parallel in an agonist-antagonist configuration. This investigation hypothesizes that the biomimetic active-knee prosthesis, with a variable impedance control, can improve unilateral transfemoral amputee locomotion in level-ground walking, reducing the metabolic cost of walking at selfselected speeds. To evaluate this hypothesis, a preliminary study investigated the clinical impact of the active knee prosthesis on the metabolic cost of walking of four unilateral above-knee amputees. This preliminary study compared the antagonistic active knee prosthesis with subjects' prescribed knee prostheses. The subjects' prescribed prostheses encompass four of the leading prosthetic knee technologies commercially available, including passive and electronically controlled variable-damping prosthetic systems. Use of the novel biomimetic active knee prosthesis resulted in a metabolic cost reduction for all four subjects by an average of 5. 8 %. Kinematic and kinetic analyses indicate that the active knee can increase self-selected walking speed in addition to reducing upper body vertical displacement during walking by an average of 16 %. The results of this investigation report for the first time a metabolic cost reduction when walking with a prosthetic system comprised of an electrically powered active knee and passive foot-ankle prostheses, as compared to walking with a conventional transfemoral prosthesis. With this work I aim to advance the field of biomechatronics, contributing to the development of integral assistive technologies that adapt to the needs of the physically challenged. by Ernesto Carlos Martinez-Villalpando.

The first part is a description of a test rig for the measurement of the heat generated by high speed sprag clutch assemblies during cyclic torsional loading. The second part describes a finite element modeling procedure for sliding contact. The test rig provides a cyclic torsional load of 756 inch-pounds at 5000 rpm using a four-square arrangement. The sprag <b>clutch</b> test <b>unit</b> was placed between the high speed pinions of the circulating power loop. The test unit was designed to have replaceable inner ad outer races, which contain the instrumentation to monitor the sprag clutch. The torque loading device was chosen to be a water cooled magnetic clutch, which is controlled either manually or through a computer. In the second part, a Generalized Eulerian-Lagrangian formulation for non-linear dynamic problems is developed for solid materials. This formulation is derived from the basic laws and axioms of continuum mechanics. The novel aspect of this method is that we are able to investigate the physics in the spatial region of interest as material flows through it without having to follow material points. A finite element approximation to the governing equations is developed. Iterative Methods for the solution of the discrete finite element equations are explored. A FORTRAN program to implement this formulation is developed and a number of solutions to problems of sliding contact are presented...|$|R
40|$|This bachelor's thesis has {{its main}} {{focus on the}} design and {{construction}} of hardware and software for the 2006 LTU Formula Student racing car. However, it also deals with the subject of microcontroller and electronics implementation in automobiles {{as well as a}} description of the Formula Student event, at which the electronics will are used. During a short project course in the late fall / early winter of 2005, the author came in contact with computer aided design of electronics and programming of microcontrollers. Design of the hardware for the steeringwheel was also begun. This led to the fact that a bachelors thesis project focusing on the software and hardware for the steering wheel and the software for the gear shifting and clutch control ECU as well as the implementation of these systems in the racing car, would make a natural follow-up. The hardware in the steering wheel consists of a printed circuit board (PCB) with various components mounted, the main one being the Atmel AVR AT 90 CAN 128 microcontroller. This microcontroller is an excellent choice for use in autmotive systems because it offers a wide variety of functions, among these a CAN controller and it is affordable and it is easy to use. The hardware for the gear shifting and <b>clutch</b> control <b>unit</b> was made by two members of the previous year's Formula Student team, as an upgrade for this year's car.

The high caster angle has been reduced, which in turn reduces the wheelbase from 100" [...] to 99.4". The rear sway bar has decreased in size from 20 mm to 19 mm. The gear ratios of second, third and fourth gears have been made longer (higher ratio) in order to improve fuel economy and drivability, which inadvertently reduces 1/4 mile drag racing times due to the ability to trap 114 mi/h km/h in 4th gear, without the shift to 5th.

5000|$|Mechanical punch presses {{fall into}} two {{distinct}} types, {{depending on the type}} of clutch or braking system with which they are equipped. Generally older presses are [...] "full revolution" [...] presses that require a full revolution of the crankshaft for them to come to a stop. Full revolution clutch presses are known to be dangerous and outlawed in many countries unless the pinch point is fully guarded. This is because the braking mechanism depends on a set of raised keys or [...] "dogs" [...] to fall into matching slots to stop the ram. A full revolution clutch can only bring the ram to a stop at the same location- top dead center. Newer presses are often [...] "part revolution" [...] presses equipped with braking systems identical to the brakes on commercial trucks. When air is applied, a band-type brake expands and allows the crankshaft to revolve. When the stopping mechanism is applied the air is bled, causing the clutch to open and the braking system to close, stopping the ram in any part of its rotation. Modern part revolution <b>clutch</b> & brake <b>units</b> are normally combined units that operate in a fail safe mode, a dual air safety valve engages clutch and starts slide motion and brake is applied by springs.|$|R
40|$|Decreased {{mobility}} of gravid females {{is thought to}} be an important cost of reproduction in lizards. We measured sprint speeds of female western fence lizards (Sceloporus occidentalis Baird and Girard) before and after they had oviposited. Females from two California populations were about 20 % slower when gravid, females from an Oregon population were about 30 % slower, and females from a Washington population were about 45 % slower, compared to their speeds after recovering from reproduction. The decrease in sprint speed persisted for several weeks after oviposition, suggesting that reproduction impairs sprint performance by affecting body condition in addition to the burdening effect of eggs. Oregon and Washington females carried more mass (both somatic and <b>clutch</b> mass) per <b>unit</b> body length than California females. On the shorter bodies of Oregon and Washington lizards, eggs may interfere with the mechanics of running, in addition to their effect on the total mass of the female. In addition, gravid females from Washington had significantly higher reproductive investment (mass of clutch relative to the mass of the female after oviposition) than Oregon and California populations. Greater reproductive investment by Washington females increases the burden carried per unit of body length; we suggest this further impairs sprint performance. Decrements in sprint speed were not significantly correlated with level of reproductive investment (per unit body mass) among females within any of the study populations. However, the burden carried per unit body length was correlated with the sprint speed decrement among gravid females from Oregon. Comparisons within and among populations suggest that differences in morphology among northern and southern populations interact with reproductive investment to produce interpopulation differences in sprint performance for gravid females...|$|R
40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsTerry GriffinLarge acreage {{farms and}} even {{moderate}} sized farms employing custom applicators and harvesters have multiple {{machines in the}} same field {{at the same time}} conducting the same field operation. As a method to control input costs and minimize application overlap, these machines have been equipped with automatic section control (ASC). For nearly all these multiple-vehicle operations, over application is a concern especially for more irregularly shaped fields; however modern technology including automated guidance combined with automatic section control allow reduced doubling of input application including seeds, fertilizer, and spray. Automatic section control depends on coverage maps stored locally on each vehicle {{to determine whether or not}} to apply input products and up to now, there has not been a clear method to share these maps between vehicles in the same field. Without sharing coverage maps, an individual ASC planting unit only has location data where it has applied individually and no location data for where other planting units have applied seed in that same field. Automatic section control relies upon shared coverage maps to be continually updated between each planting unit and utilizes existing machine telematics infrastructure for map data sharing. Telematics utilizes a cloud computing platform and cellular connectivity which in rural areas is known to have limited service levels. Planting operations were simulated for two 16 -row planters, each using two John Deere GreenStar 3 2630 monitors, simulated GPS location data stream, electronic rate control units, and individual row <b>unit</b> <b>clutches</b> to have control at the finest granularity. Each simulated planting unit is equipped with automatic section control and telematics gateways to share coverage map data from the first planting unit to JDLink cloud infrastructure then out to the second. This study evaluates the impact that field size and shape have on using multiple ASC planters and coverage map sharing, and estimates seed cost savings from reducing over application because coverage maps are shared between planting units. The impact of sharing coverage maps with both planting units using field boundaries with automatic section control and without using field boundaries were evaluated. Guidance line headings were determined using AgLeader SMS’s mission planning feature to minimize the number of passes across each field based on the field boundary and implement width. Each field was run twice using parallel tracking, once each with and without coverage map sharing to observe the extent of over application. The field level data were then taken to examine a fictious 3, 000 acre farming operation where the field level data was used as a partial composition of the farm operation. An embedded Microsoft Excel macro was used to create 8, 008 different composition scenarios to determine farm level savings. The average farm savings was $ 58, 909 per year. Additionally, using the 8, 008 scenarios, time value of money was examined to determine the the minimum area required annually for five years for this technology to pay back. The average was 133 acres each year for five years. Equipment manufacturers and farmers have interest in these results. In general, equipment manufacturers desire to create a service-based product to be sold such that continual revenue path provides value added services after the precision agriculture hardware is sold. In this study, the existing telematics product offerings are tied to shared coverage maps to provide a value-add to an existing service. Farmers want to ensure this is a sound equipment investment with payback in a relatively short time period. As farm input costs continue to rise especially relative to crop prices, reducing over application will be critical to limit waste...|$|R
