40|$|Cu-MoS 2 {{self-lubricating}} coatings {{were prepared}} {{on high speed}} steel by electro-spark deposition (ESD) by electrode with drilled holes {{at the end of}} faces. The holes were filled with MoS 2. The composition and micro morphology of the coatings were analysed. The effects of capacitance and deposition time on coating thickness were studied, and also the friction performance and wear mechanism were studied. The results show that there is nothing but MoS 2 and Cu exist in the coating fabricated by this way. The micrographs show that the coating surface is uneven and many pores existing on the surface, showing typical characteristics of ESD; the surface quality is the best when it was prepared in the 3 rd <b>grade</b> <b>capacitance.</b> Coating thickness firstly increases and then decreases with the increase of capacitance and deposition time. The self-lubricating coating prepared in the 3 rd-grade capacitance has the lowest friction coefficient. The friction coefficients of the self-lubricating coatings prepared in the 1 st and the 3 rd grades stay almost constant with the increase of friction time. The friction coefficient of self-lubricating coatings prepared in the 5 th grade show a clear upward trend when friction time increases. Scanning electron microscope images show shear-slip phenomenon on the wear surface...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Traceability {{practices}} and their compliances in low grown orthodox black tea manufacturing process were examined, while proposing possible solutions for identified major drawbacks. The physical traceability in supply chain was considered one {{step forward and}} one step backward {{from the point of}} manufacturing, starting from auction/buyer back to supplier. Randomized stratified sampling was used. The traceability was evaluated using a checklist, end product sampling, open ended interviews, observations and internal document studies. The orthodox process was more complicated unlike other production processes due to the different separation techniques employed for grading and variety of grades produced because the sifting/grading was the key to number of different tea varieties. Major traceability issues were observed in leaf collection and grading operations due to complexity of separation through Myddleton, Chota, Michie and Winnower, which reduced the specific amounts produced, where bulking and blending process further extended complexity, while increasing the mixing of different made tea together with increased number of suppliers. Considering 1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd dhool and big bulk with given separation techniques during grading; a single tea leaf could pass many paths before it end up in a specific product due to weight, size and shape of the leaf of a shoot based on the way it was rolled in orthodox rollers, where traceability up to tea <b>bush,</b> <b>grading,</b> blending and traceability of sample back to supplier was not fully complying.
