40|$|Indexación: Web of Science; PubMedBackground: Zoonotic Visceral Leishmaniasis (ZVL) is a {{vector-borne disease}} {{affecting}} humans and other mammals and {{caused by the}} protozoan parasite Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum (syn. L. chagasi), belonging to the L. donovani complex. The regions in Northern Argentina (above 32 degrees S) are its southern distribution limit in South America. Results: We detected Leishmania sp. DNA (most likely belonging to the L. donovani complex) in 37. 5 % of 32 grey foxes (Pseudalopex griseus) captured in Argentinean Patagonia (48 degrees S and 50 degrees S). Eleven monosexual pools of Amblyomma tigrinum ticks from eight different foxes (six grey <b>foxes</b> and two <b>culpeo</b> <b>foxes</b> P. culpaeus) were also positive. The southernmost known distribution limit for L. infantum, and the southernmost reported capture of a phlebotominae, had previously been 2000 and 750 km north of our study area, respectively. Conclusions: This finding is significant because it markedly extends the distribution area of leishmaniasis; supports {{the existence of a}} sylvatic cycle in the absence of dogs; and has implications in transmission, indicating that either sand fly distribution is broader than currently thought or non-sand fly Leishmania maintenance is possible. Additional molecular, parasitological, epidemiological and entomological studies are still needed. [URL]...|$|R

50|$|The elegant fat-tailed mouse opossum is crepuscular (active mainly around twilight). It {{lives in}} nests (abandoned by birds and rodents, or built by itself) in tree hollows, under rocks and roots. It is {{arboreal}} (tree-living) {{as well as}} terrestrial (land-living). The opossum feeds mainly on arthropods and larvae, along with fruits, small vertebrates and carrion. This opossum can use its prehensile tail, regardless of its thickness, to efficiently climb and grasp branches - an ability not as developed in other small Chilean mammals. Nests are generally occupied by one individual; in southern Chile, the home range of this opossum is 1,383 m2 large in July, and shrinks to 781 m2 in December. Predators of this opossum include the <b>culpeo</b> <b>fox,</b> burrowing owl and the great horned owl.|$|E
50|$|Over 70 {{animal species}} have been {{documented}} on the reserve. Common bird species include the Andean condor Vultur gryphus, Darwin's rhea Rhea pennata, and flamingo.

The annual round up is monitored by the Wildlife Conservation Society, and wool and yarn are exported abroad.|$|E
50|$|The <b>culpeo</b> <b>fox</b> is an {{opportunistic}} predator {{that will}} take any variety of prey. This fox mainly feeds on rodents and lagomorphs (especially the introduced European rabbit and European hare); however, it occasionally feeds on domestic livestock and young guanacos. Culpeos are considered beneficial because they are significant predators of the rabbits introduced in 1915; such introduced rabbit populations {{are believed to have}} allowed culpeos to spread from the Andean foothills across the Patagonian plain. They sometimes take young lambs up to a week old. In limited studies, the larger culpeo appears to dominate potential competitors, including South American gray foxes, Geoffroy's cats, Pampas cats, grisons and various raptorial birds. Its range also overlaps that of the much larger puma, but the size difference ensures that the two species have limited competition.|$|E

The land mammals are mostly nocturnal and avoid human contact. National parks, which provide protection to the mammals, are the most likely locations where these animals can be seen. There are 18 endemic mammal species. Marine mammals (such as whales, otters, sea lions, dolphins) and birds are quite easily seen along the long coastline in the Pacific Ocean {{to the west of the}} country.

During 7 years, we used visitation indices to bait stations in a national park and neighboring sheep ranches of southern Argentina. We operated bait stations during three consec- utive nights and calculated seven indices of relative abundance. For each fox species, we compared the power of different monitoring designs and scenarios that combined visitation indices, effort (number of bait station lines and survey frequency) while controlling for type I error, and magnitude of population change during a given period. We looked at the combinations that produced high power (β ≤ 0. 24). The operation of bait stations during several nights markedly increased statistical power.

40|$|This study {{details for}} the first time the food habits of the <b>culpeo</b> or Andean <b>fox</b> (Lycalopex culpaeus) in high areas of the Ecuadorian Andes during a {{complete}} annual cycle. Our objective was to identify prey species, calculate their contribution to diet and test for temporal variation. In total, 304 Andean fox scats were collected within the Podocarpus National Park (Loja province, southern Ecuador). By analysing the content of scats 413 prey items were identified and classified into eight prey groups. Subsequently, the frequency of occurrence (FO) for each prey group was calculated per month together with the relative contribution of estimated consumed biomass (CB). In addition, the Shannon-Wiener’s index was calculated as a measurement of monthly diet diversity. The results show a diet dominated by cervids belonging to the Mazama and Pudu genus (70 % FO), followed by small mammals (30 % FO), large rodents (12 % FO), carnivorous species (10 % FO) and lagomorphs (8 % FO). There was temporal variation in the consumption of both deer and small mammals. Cervids also provided the major part of the consumed biomass (70 % CB), the remaining prey categories each accounted for less than 11 % CB. Negative correlations in consumption were observed between cervids and two other groups, rabbits and small mammals. Trophic diversity values fluctuated throughout the year showing a mean of 1. 7. The results obtained show a diets very different from those previously reported; deer being the bulk of the diet instead of rodents or other mammals. The consumption of carnivorous species in the area was also high in comparison with other regions. Overall, this study clearly demonstrates that the culpeo is an important top predator in the high-Andean ecosystem...|$|R
40|$|The higher {{proximity}} among humans, {{domestic animals}} and wildlife favours disease spill-over both from wildlife to domestic animals and vice versa, {{which is a}} potential risk for the extinction of wildlife populations and could be influencing the emergence and/or re-emergence of zoonotic diseases. The domestic dog (Canis familiaris) is the most abundant and widely distributed carnivore worldwide and {{is known to be}} carrying many infectious diseases. Among these diseases, domestic dogs are known to be source of canine distemper virus (CDV), canine parvovirus (CPV) and Echinococcus granulosus to wild carnivores and human being. Populations of domestic dogs inhabiting urban areas can be the source of infection of directly transmitted pathogens, since in these areas a high density of domestic dogs can facilitate the maintenance of these infections to both domestic and wild carnivore populations. In addition, the knowledge of the diseases present in the domestic dog populations in close proximity to wildlife is essential for conservation planning and for control of both zoonotic diseases and diseases of conservation concern. This thesis explores the effect of urbanization on the epidemiology of CDV, CPV, and E granulosus in domestic dogs and wild carnivores of the Coquimbo region of Chile as for example, chilla (L. griseus) and <b>culpeo</b> (L. culpaeus) <b>foxes</b> and assess the risk factors that could be facilitate disease transmission between canid inhabiting urban and rural areas. The first of the chapters containing original data, Chapter 3, describe the demography of dogs in the study area, indicating that urban sites have a greater population and a higher density of domestic dogs, a high growth rate and therefore a high turnover of susceptible than rural areas, which can be of relevance for the differences in diseases transmission patterns between these sites. Chapter 4 describe the degree of interaction between wild and domestic carnivores and its effect on interespecific disease transmission; indicating that in the study area there are many opportunities for domestic/wild carnivores interactions, as for example livestock predation by carnivores, by approaching to peridomestic environments, facilitating in this scenario the transmission of CDV, CPV and also E. granulosus by predating on livestock contaminated with cyst echinococcosis. Chapter 5 indicate that urban areas hold domestic dog populations with higher CDV seroprevalence than rural sites and probably these areas are the source of infection to rural sites. In contrast, a more stable CPV seroprevalence was found between urban and rural areas, indicating that possibly this pathogen follow an endemic state across the study area. Chapter 6 describe the factors for E. granulosus prevalence in domestic dogs, livestock and human being, suggesting that more cases of E. granulosus in livestock and in humans are found in provinces of the Coquimbo region with higher percentage of rural population; however, and unexpectedly, more cases of E. granulosus in domestic dogs were found in urban areas, although analysis of risk factors indicated that those domestic dogs inhabiting in the borders of urban areas, were at greater risk of being infected with E. granulosus than those in the centre of these areas. The results of this study exemplify how three pathogens are found in urban areas which can be source of infection to domestic and wild carnivores in the study area.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{metabolic}} {{costs associated with}} the ingestion of peppertree fruits (Schinus molle) in the <b>culpeo</b> <b>fox,</b> Pseudalopex culpaeus, the second largest canid in South America. Throughout its range of distribution, this fox feeds on rodents and other small vertebrates, and also on peppertree fruits, which represent 98 % of total fruits consumed in semiarid Chile. Peppertree contains a high diversity of phytochemicals. Foxes feeding on diets containing rats and peppertree fruits (mixed diets) exhibited a 98. 9 % increase in basal rate of metabolism when compared to rat-acclimated foxes. Thus, acute ingestion of chemically defended fruits has an energetic cost for the fox, reflected in higher values of basal metabolism. Increased metabolic rates may be associated with increased protein synthesis for detoxification and for tissue repair, including the production of biotransformation enzymes...|$|E
40|$|Diurnal human {{activity}} and domestic dogs in agro-forestry mosaics should theoretically modify the diurnal habitat use patterns of native carnivores, with these effects being scale-dependent. We combined intensive camera trapping data with Bayesian occurrence proba-bility models to evaluate both diurnal and nocturnal patterns of space use by carnivores in {{a mosaic of}} land-use types in southern Chile. A total of eight carnivores species were recorded, including human-introduced dogs. During the day the most frequently detected species were the <b>culpeo</b> <b>fox</b> and the cougar.

The best supported models showed that native carnivores responded differently to landscape attributes and dogs depending on both {{the time of day}} as well as the spatial scale of landscape attributes. The positive effect of native forest cover at 250 m and 500 m radius buffers was stronger during the night for the Darwin's fox and cougar.

Equations are obtained for inferring {{the sex of}} skulls of juvenile, subadult and adult culpeo foxes. The equations {{are based on a}} reduced set of variables obtained from stepwise discriminant analyses by age class on skull measurements. The discriminant power of all functions is estimated {{on the basis of a}} jackknife reclassification procedure. Correct classification is higher than 85 % for both sexes, and is similar to, or higher than, the values reported for other foxes. The use of the discriminant function pooling subadult and adult skulls is rec ommended because it shows a high percentage of correct classification without the necessity of ascribing a collected skull to the subadult or adult age class before sex estimation. The equations provide an easy method to estimate the sex ratio of wild populations of this furbearer species using the abundant carcasses discarded throughout north-western Patagonia as a result of the intense hunting of the species. The information on sex ratios will help in the study of population dynamics and when monitoring the harvest of culpeo foxes. Peer reviewe...|$|E

We assessed how differences in prey abundance between native forests and exotic plantations in southern Chile may explain the prey selection of four mesocarnivores, as analyzed from their scats. Using a spatial zero-inflated Poissonmodel,we determined that the abundance ofmost small mammals was lower in plantations than native forests, except for three common species, which had similar or larger abundances in exotic plantations. We assessed mesocarnivores' prey selection by assessing the coefficients and log-ratios of use and availability of a Bayesian Resource Selection Function. We determined that in native forest, the preferences of kodkod (Leopardus guigna) for arboreal prey was stronger, whereas chilla fox (Pseudalopex griseus) and Darwin's fox (Pseudalopex fulvipes) exhibited a selective preference for ground prey. Darwin's fox also exhibited a habitat-dependent changes in their selection for Darwin's leaf-eared mouse (Phyllotis darwini), from a positive log ratio in native forest to a negative ratio in exotic plantations.

Grey foxes consumed a larger proportion of rodents than culpeos (66. 1 % versus 37. % of occurrences in feces, respectively), and culpeos consumed a larger proportion of the introduced European hare (Lepus europaeus) (32. 8 % versus 7. 1 %, respectively). Additionally, arthropods made up {{a significant portion of the}} diet of the grey fox, and occurred in the 95. 5 % of the analyzed feces. Despite the great differences in size of culpeo and grey foxes, the former being significantly larger, both species consumed the same type of prey, and no significant differences in the mean weight of vertebrate prey were detected in their diets. Culpeo and grey foxes diets differed during spring – summer with low values of mean diet overlap (31 %). But in autumn – winter, when prey diversity is lower in Patagonia, diet was more similar and diet overlap (73 %) increased. An exploratory analysis of habitat use by culpeo and grey foxes suggested that both species utilize habitat in a similar way. Our data agree with generalizations about competitive interactions between the large and the small canid in an assemblage. Although both foxes can potentially consume the same type of prey, through interference the larger culpeo would exclude the smaller grey fox from habitats with high-quality prey, resulting in prey partitioning. The possibility that both foxes partition habitat at a finer scale in our study area should be explored. Peer reviewe...|$|E
