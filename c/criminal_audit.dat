40|$|The aim of {{my thesis}} is the {{evaluation}} of tax audit issues and eventually to propose changes de lege ferendae. At the same time I apply the principles of tax audit in its selected aspects. The main aim of the thesis - a complex evaluation of the tax audit - achieved through partial commentaries and evaluations, which {{are reflected in the}} titles of each chapter and by using scientific methods such as descriptive method, the method of deduction and applications, as well as the synthesis method and the method of subjective criticism. The logical structure of my thesis is accurately represented by the structure of its seven chapters and several subchapters and its names. In the first chapter I discuss the institute of tax audit in general. In the second chapter I discuss the principles that need to be applied to institute of tax audit. The third chapter deals with stages of tax audits. The fourth chapter is reserved to protection during and after tax <b>audit.</b> <b>Criminal</b> context of tax audit is discussed in fifth chapter.

40|$|Aims: To {{investigate}} psychosocial {{characteristics and}} problems of {{a representative sample of}} Swedish drunk drivers with special consideration of the gender of the driver; analyze criminal records of the drivers before and after enrolment in the study; identify psychosocial predictors of relapse to drunk driving. Methods: Psychosocial characteristics were assessed by the Addiction Severity Index (ASI). Alcohol problems were additionally assessed by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (<b>AUDIT).</b> <b>Criminal</b> records were collected for the five year period before the enrolment, and for the subsequent two years, from Sweden’s official crime statistics. Results: About half of the investigated drivers had other psychosocial problems besides the drink driving offence. Female drivers had more alcohol, drug, psychiatric and relational problems, including with parents when growing up, than male drivers, but less previous and subsequent criminality. Heavily drunk drivers (blood alcohol concentration 0. 1 %) had more problems with alcohol, legal status and employment and support than the other drunk drivers. Problems with legal status, family and social relations and alcohol use increased the risk of relapse in drunk driving, while medical problems seemed to be a protective factor. Different ASI risk factors were identified for relapse in either traffic offences or other crimes. Conclusions: As well as the drunk driving offence, drunk drivers often have other psychosocial problems, female drivers in particular. Already the blood alcohol concentration per se gives some indication of the psychosocial problem profile of a drunk driver and the ASI profile has some prognostic value for relapse in drunk driving...|$|R
40|$|Examines how effectively, {{efficiently}} and economically prisoners have been transported throughout Victoria 2 ̆ 7 s <b>criminal</b> justice system. <b>Audit</b> summary:  In Victoria, {{there is a}} minimum of 58 000 prisoner movements per year {{for a variety of}} reasons. Prisoners are moved between prisons to accommodate changes in their risk profile, maximise prison capacity, attend health and welfare programs, and facilitate court appearances. They move between police cells to maximise capacity and attend court and are also moved to hospitals and forensic health facilities for planned and emergency medical care. Recent changes to the external criminal justice environment have affected prisoner numbers and, consequently, the need for prisoner movements. Changes include modifications to the parole process and the abolition of some suspended sentences, which took effect in the County and Supreme Courts in September 2013. Combined with additional factors, such as increases in average sentence lengths and imprisonment rates, these changes have contributed to significant growth in prisoner movements. The audit assessed whether the transportation of prisoners in Victoria 2 ̆ 7 s criminal justice system is effective, efficient and economical. It examined prisoner transport services managed by Corrections Victoria and used by Victoria Police and the Department of Human Services. The audit scope also examined the transportation of prisoners by Victoria Police. It excluded interstate and overseas prisoner movement. The audit included prisoners as defined by the Corrections Act 1986, and youth detainees where they are defined as prisoners for the purposes of prisoner transport services.  ...|$|R
