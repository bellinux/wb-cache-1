5|$|Although characterised at {{the time}} and since as actions against piracy, this charge has been disputed by historians and archivists in the UAE in particular, notably the current Ruler of Sharjah, HH Dr Sheikh Sultan bin Muhammad Al-Qasimi in his book 'The Myth of Arabian Piracy in the Gulf'. The <b>counter-argument</b> is that the Al Qasimi, a strong and {{independent}} maritime force, were the subject of British aggression in an attempt to stamp its authority - and that of its Omani allies - on trade routes thought of as important to Iraq and India.|$|E
5|$|The Court reargued {{the case}} {{at the behest of}} Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter, who used reargument as a {{stalling}} tactic, to allow the Court to gather a consensus around a Brown opinion that would outlaw segregation. The justices in support of desegregation spent much effort convincing those who initially intended to dissent to join a unanimous opinion. Although the legal effect would be same for a majority rather than unanimous decision, it was felt that dissent could be used by segregation supporters as a legitimizing <b>counter-argument.</b>|$|E
40|$|From a (pragma) dialectical {{point of}} view, the {{evaluation}} of argumentation includes consideration of how well it deals with <b>counter-arguments.</b> This corresponds {{with one of the}} requirements developed in Dutch jurisprudence: if the justification of a ju dicial decision does not reflect on essential <b>counter-arguments,</b> the decision may be quashed in appeal. I will first examine what textual clues identify <b>counter-arguments</b> and objections, and then discuss the criteria that are used in legal practice to ev aluate how well the justification responds to <b>counter-arguments</b> and objections.

5|$|In late 2005, FETA's {{committee}} {{approved a}} proposal for a revamp of the tolls. The minimum toll would be set to the existing £1figure, but would increase dependent on the time of day, rising to a maximum of £4 for evening rush hour travel. All tolls would be halved for cars with more than one occupant, as an incentive to drivers to share cars and make fewer journeys. According to FETA's chairman Lawrence Marshall, the system would provide the most efficiency, claiming that 80% of peak-time journeys are made by single-occupant vehicles. The proposal, passed with the chairman's casting vote after the committee was deadlocked, was referred to the Scottish Executive in December 2005, and implementation planned for October 2007 subject to approval by transport minister Tavish Scott. Environmental groups welcomed the proposal, although local politicians condemned it as simply a means of raising capital. At the same time, a <b>counter-argument</b> was tabled by Fife councillors proposing the complete removal of tolls.|$|E
5|$|The open cabildo {{was held}} on May 22, 1810; it was debated whether the viceroy should {{continue}} in office, and if not, who should replace him. The first opinion was from Bishop Benito Lue y Riega, who held that Cisneros should continue and that, if all of Spain was conquered by France, peninsulars were meant to rule in the Americas. Castelli made a <b>counter-argument,</b> based on {{the doctrine of the}} retroversion of the sovereignty of the people that he had already employed in the defense of Paroissien. He insisted that {{in the absence of a}} legitimate authority, sovereignty should be returned to the people; they should govern themselves. The idea of dismissing the viceroy ultimately prevailed, but as Buenos Aires had no authority to decide unilaterally the new form of government, they would elect a provisional government. A congress of deputies called from all other cities would take the final decision. However, there were disputes over who should exercise the provisional government: some argued that the Cabildo should do so, and others that it should be a Junta. Castelli bowed to Saavedra's proposal to form a Junta, but with the proviso that the procurator of the Cabildo, Julián de Leiva, had a decisive vote in the appointment. By adding this proviso, Castelli sought to add the former supporters of Martín de Álzaga, such as Mariano Moreno, Domingo Matheu, and Leiva himself.|$|E

25|$|One {{response}} is {{that humans are}} not necessarily confined to Earth, and could use it and move on. A <b>counter-argument</b> is that {{only a tiny fraction}} of humans could do this—and they would be self-selected by ability to do technological escalation on others (for instance, the ability to create large spacecraft to flee the planet in, and simultaneously fend off others who seek to prevent them). Another <b>counter-argument</b> is that extraterrestrial life would encounter the fleeing humans and destroy them as a locust species. A third is that if there are no other worlds fit to support life (and no extraterrestrials who compete with humans to occupy them) it is both futile to flee, and foolish to imagine that it would take less energy and skill to protect the Earth as a habitat than it would take to construct some new habitat.|$|E

25|$|Although ibn Janah had {{intended}} {{this to be}} an uncontroversial, supportive work, many of Hayyuj's students were deeply offended by the implication that there were flaws in his research. One of them, Samuel ibn Naghrillah, wrote a book critical of the Sefer HaHasagah: discovering this (and the nature of ibn Naghrillah's critiques) in advance of its publication, ibn Janah quickly wrote a <b>counter-argument,</b> Sefer HaHashva'ah, claiming that ibn Naghrillah was merely jealous. This led to a long exchange of pamphlets between the two, which were later of great benefit to Hebrew grammarians.|$|E
25|$|Mary Bennett and David Percy {{have claimed}} in Dark Moon: Apollo and the Whistle-Blowers, that, {{with all the}} known and unknown hazards, NASA would not risk {{broadcasting}} an astronaut getting sick or dying on live television.

25|$|Judge Pine {{began the}} hearing on schedule. The steel {{companies}} {{focused on the}} issue of equitable relief. The employers' attorneys pointed out that they could not make a claim for relief if the courts found the seizure illegal. Additionally, the Federal Tort Claims Act required the government to give its consent to be sued for relief, and this the government had not done. Judge Pine pressed the steel company attorneys to address the constitutional issue, which the government had strongly emphasized in its briefs. Most of the company attorneys seemed shocked by Pine's request, and were unable to address the issue. But Charles Tuttle, counsel for Armco Steel, squarely argued the issue. In his <b>counter-argument</b> the following day, Baldridge claimed that the courts had no authority to enjoin the President of the United States and then argued that the court should ignore the constitutional issue if it could decide the case on grounds of equity. Baldridge relied heavily on Ex parte Merryman 17 F. Cas. 144 (1861), Mississippi v. Johnson 71 U.S. 475 (1866), In re Debs 158 U.S. 564 (1895) and United States v.

40|$|Two experiments, using a mock legal case, {{confirmed}} the causal role of arguments in verdict decisions and explored the process involved. Experiment I showed that verdicts varied {{with the strength}} of <b>counter-arguments</b> and Experiment 2 showed {{that the use of}} background information that undermined such arguments determined the verdict reached. Such results confirm the causal role of arguments but do not speak to the representations constructed. In both experiments we analysed the reasons proposed for verdicts. Participants generally represented the state of affairs, and conjectured state of affairs, to which the arguments referred. Experiment 2 also asked participants about the number of causal possibilities they envisaged. Confidence in the verdict was moderated by the strength of <b>counter-arguments</b> but in different ways for those who envisaged a single causal account as opposed to two causal accounts. In the former case, confidence decreased with the rated strength of <b>counter-arguments.</b> In the latter case, confidence increased.

500|$|There are {{similarities}} {{with the}} arms of Lincoln College, Oxford, {{where one of the}} elements consists of three golden stags statant (standing still); this was derived from the coat of arms of Lincoln's so-called [...] "second founder", Thomas Rotherham. It was once claimed that Jesus had stolen the stags from Lincoln, but the <b>counter-argument</b> (from an antiquarian with close Lincoln connections) was that the origins of each were distinct. One suggestion (by Paul Langford, the Rector of Lincoln College) is that Jesus College continued the arms adopted by a theological college founded by Rotherham in his home town– Jesus College, Rotherham– which had been suppressed in the time of Edward VI.|$|E
500|$|Avicenna anticipates {{that one}} could reject the {{argument}} {{by saying that the}} collection of contingent things may not be contingent. A whole does not automatically share the features of its parts; for example, in mathematics a set of numbers is not a number. Therefore, the objection goes, the step in the argument that assumes that the collection of contingent things is also contingent, is wrong. However, Avicenna dismisses this <b>counter-argument</b> as a capitulation, and not an objection at all. If the entire collection of contingent things is not contingent, then it must be necessary. This also leads to the conclusion that there is a necessary existent, the very thing Avicenna is trying to prove. Avicenna remarks, [...] "in a certain way, this is the very thing that is sought".|$|E
500|$|Many {{guidelines}} and testing procedures have strict procedures for disclosure and confidentiality to allow individuals {{to decide when}} and how to receive their results and also to whom the results are made available. Financial institutions and businesses are faced with the question of whether to use genetic test results when assessing an individual, such as for life insurance or employment. The United Kingdom's insurance companies have agreed that until 2017 they will not use genetic information when writing insurance policies under , but Huntington's is explicitly excluded from this agreement. [...] As with other untreatable genetic conditions with a later onset, it is ethically questionable to perform pre-symptomatic testing on a child or adolescent, as there would be no medical benefit for that individual. There is consensus for testing only individuals who are considered cognitively mature, although there is a <b>counter-argument</b> that parents have a right to make the decision on their child's behalf. With the lack of an effective treatment, testing a person under legal age who is not judged to be competent is considered unethical in most cases.|$|E
