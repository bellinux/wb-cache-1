We find that the new <b>charged</b> <b>gauge</b> bosons W_H^- and X^-, which are predicted by the littlest Higgs model and the SU(3) simple model, respectively, can be abundantly produced at the LHC. However, since the main backgrounds coming from the processes pp→ tt̅+X and pp→ tW^-+X are very large, the values of the ratios N_W and N_X are very small in most of the parameter space.

Characters can now immediately gain an Element by equipping the Sopia of other characters, instead of gaining Elements by using magical attacks or items. Several new abilities have been added along with those from the previous games and it is now possible to upgrade Sopia to unlock new abilities using SP earned in battle. It is now impossible for both characters to have the same Sopia at once, unlike in previous installments where Genes could be equipped on both characters simultaneously. Unlike in the last two games where the characters were divided into fixed pairs, the player character often switches after accomplishing certain objectives and the player's partner is also subject to change at certain points. Each partner has different abilities and attributes. Unlike in Omega, the game has branching story paths that are unlocked as the player progresses, similar to the original Chaos Rings.Characters can now manifest certain abilities outside of battle to cross obstacles and destroy barriers. Again, the kind of ability depends on the characters being played at the time, although it is now possible to change the members of the party from the central hub to unlock previously unreachable areas.|$|E
40|$|In the {{recently}} proposed {{extension of the}} YM theory, non-Abelian tensor gauge field of the second rank is represented by a general tensor whose symmetric part describes the propagation of <b>charged</b> <b>gauge</b> boson of helicity two and its antisymmetric part - the helicity zero <b>charged</b> <b>gauge</b> boson.

50|$|Support {{characters}} {{return with}} 2 new features. The first feature is Support Types. These types are Defense, Attack, and Balanced. Each of {{these can be}} unlocked for each support character and will decide {{the actions of the}} support character during Support Drive level 1. The 2nd new feature is the Support Drive. Support Drive has 2 levels. Level 1 is activated once the players support characters are summoned enough times. When Support Drive level 1 is activated, the players support characters will summon themselves automatically depending on their support type depending on what actions the player is executing. When a support character automatically summons itself, it will not reset the support character <b>charge</b> <b>gauge,</b> and can even summon when the gauge is not full. A support character cannot be manually summoned by the player if it has already automatically summoned itself. If a support character is set to Defense, it will automatically summon itself when the player is charging chakra, block the opponent from dashing into the player. When a support character is set to Attack, it will help the player attack the opponent through combos, and knock the opponent back when a combo sends them flying. When a support character is set to Balanced, they will throw projectiles alongside the player when the player uses chakra projectiles and block incoming Ultimate Jutsus, at the expense of losing that support for a while. When Support Drive level 2 is activated, for a limited amount of time the player will be capable of releasing a Team Ultimate Jutsu. A Team Ultimate Jutsu is activated by hitting the chakra button 3 times and then the attack button. A Team Ultimate Jutsu drains an enormous amount of the players chakra, and does massive damage if it makes contact with an unguarded opponent.|$|E

40|$|Battery {{monitoring}} is used {{to acquire}} information about battery conditions. It’s a regular technology {{that most of us}} uses on daily bases. The <b>charge</b> <b>gauge</b> in a cellphone, consisting of bars which indicate the degree of charge left in the battery is an example. Battery monitoring gives the cellphone user information about the battery. The background to the thesis work is that this technology is requested for vehicles because empty or broken batteries {{are one of the most}} common causes for involuntary stops. One way to monitor battery conditions is with a battery sensor, which is a mechanical device that measures and calculates battery conditions. This thesis’ purpose is to develop evaluation criteria and evaluation methods to assess the possibility for battery sensors to deliver competent information in order to ensure functionality of electric systems. To enable generalized evaluations of battery sensors, their delivered information are delimited to three different and defined battery conditions which are State-Of-Charge (SOC), State-Of-Function (SOF) and State-Of-Health (SOH). To be able to compare battery sensor calculations and actual battery conditions, a method to obtain the battery conditions was needed. To determine this method a literature review was performed and because of an accurate and continuous method was needed, Coulomb counting was selected. Coulomb counting is a book-keeping method which calculates the SOC accurate based on current integration. To develop criteria that evaluate battery sensors possibilities to deliver competent information, tests about how vehicles starting affect batteries as well as tests about battery sensors performance in different scenarios have been investigated. The thesis work shows that the SOC has to be limited based on the degree of charge left in a battery, SOF has to be limited to batteries potential to deliver a certain voltage for a specific constant current and for SOH it is most important to maintain a continuous countdown. The evaluation methods to evaluate battery sensors according to the criteria have been developed to test and ensure the battery sensors performance based on several test-cycles. The evaluation methods with certain conditions and test-cycles should be comparable to actual conditions for battery sensors installed on vehicles to ensure a continuous delivering of competent information. To summary the thesis work has developed and partly verified evaluation criteria and evaluation methods to evaluate battery sensors possibility to deliver competent information about the battery conditions SOC, SOF and SOH. These criteria and methods make it possible to evaluate if a battery sensor, any battery sensor calculating these battery conditions based on similar parameters, could deliver enough competent information in order to ensure functionality of electric systems...|$|E

40|$|The one-loop level {{mediated}} t-> c γ decay is {{analyzed in}} the framework of 331 models, which induce three-level flavor-changing neutral currents mediated by an extra neutral gauge boson, Z', and a neutral scalar boson, ϕ. These models also predict new <b>charged</b> <b>gauge</b> and scalar bosons, together with three new quarks, which can be exotic (with electric charges of - 4 / 3 e and 5 / 3 e) or standard model like. Apart from the contribution of the W boson, the t→ cγ decay receives contributions induced by the extra gauge boson and the neutral scalar boson, which are generic for 331 models. In the so-called minimal 331 model, there are additional contributions from the new <b>charged</b> <b>gauge</b> and scalar bosons accompanied by the exotic quarks. We present analytical results for the most general t-> cγ amplitude in terms of transcendental functions. For the numerical analysis we focus on the minimal 331 model: the current bounds on the model parameters are examined and a particular scenario is discussed in which the corresponding branching ratio could be of the order of 10 ^- 6, with the dominant contributions arising from the <b>charged</b> <b>gauge</b> bosons and a relatively light neutral scalar boson with flavor-changing couplings, whereas the Z' contribution would be of the order of 10 ^- 9 for m_Z'> 2 TeV. However, a further suppression could be expected due to a potential suppression of the values of the flavor-changing coupling constants. Under the same assumptions, in 331 models without exotic quarks, the t-> cγ branching ratio would receive the dominant contribution from the neutral scalar boson, which could be of the order of 10 ^- 7 for a Higgs mass of a few hundreds of GeVs.
