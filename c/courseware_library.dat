40|$|Fifth in {{a series}} of six monographs on the use of new {{technologies}} in the instruction of learning disabled students, the paper describes how schools can plan for the acquisition of computer hardware and software, and how they can provide district-level staff training in its use. Discussion focuses on the development of a technology implementation plan and on a critical analysis of the three ilajor components of a school-based computer approach: hardware, software, and training. Topics addressed include current approaches to technology implementation, components of the planning process (Board of Education, district planning committee, and key persons at the local level), and key issues and decisions (e. g., centralized or decentralized decision-making, short- or long-term plans). Issues related to training and staff development are also discussed; these include encouraging teacher participation, content of inservice programs, and designing effective training. Aspects of hardware selection (stand-alone and network systems) are addressed next. The monograph concludes with a discussion of issues associated with software selection (acquisition of <b>courseware</b> <b>libraries,</b> delivery s 7 stems, and local courseware production).

40|$|Presentation from Online Northwest 2006 conference. Over 70 {{percent of}} college {{students}} both use and report that they like using CMS (Course Management Systems), according to a 2005 ECAR survey. As librarians {{we have the opportunity}} to reach our large number of courseware users by integrating our resources and services with this software. In {{the first part of the}} presentation we will give an overview of <b>courseware</b> and how <b>libraries</b> are currently using it to connect with students, including providing links, posting resources, and providing instruction. We will then focus on a case study using Blackboard <b>courseware</b> for course-related <b>library</b> instruction. Combining classroom instruction with Blackboard discussion to teach the elements of a literature review, we will explore both the process and its assessment...|$|R
40|$|The first {{conference of}} the Association for Learning Technology (ALT-C 94), sub-titled Enabling Active Learning, {{took place at the}} University of Hull last September. It {{provided}} a unique opportunity for lecturers, <b>courseware</b> developers, <b>library</b> staff, computing support staff, educational development staff and institutional managers to meet and discuss the effective implementation of educational technology. Space has allowed only a small selection of the papers presented to be included in this special issue of ALT-J devoted mainly to the conference, but these papers address the major issues discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to model a {{practical}} solution to the lack of library modules within commercial courseware. There are many different programming languages and models librarians can use to implement similar course modules. If librarians lack the skills to build these applications, student workers skilled in computer science can help. Scales, J., Wolf, D., Johnson, C. M., Cummings, L. A.

40|$|It {{has become}} {{increasingly}} evident that the interpretation {{of much of the}} medical research in health sciences depends to a large extent on statistical methods. For this reason, it is essential that students in these fields be exposed to statistical reasoning, data analysis, and computation early in their careers. With the current advances in the methodology for data analysis we {{can take advantage of the}} highly developed computer software. Nowadays the internet provides rapid feedback to the student and dissemination of the latest research information. This paper focuses on the teaching of biostatistics to health professionals with computer-based supplements; <b>courseware,</b> digital <b>library</b> of TV lectures on SAS and interactive communication through the Internet. 1...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{information}} and communications technology in education is transforming learning and teaching practices in significant ways. For instance, {{as a result of}} the utilization of computer mediated communications technology with multimedia <b>courseware,</b> electronic <b>libraries</b> and databases, a whole new kind of educational experience is emerging, namely elearning or networked learning (Rosenberg, 2001; Steeples, & Jones, 2002). E-Learning refers to the use of networked information and communciations technology to leverage the core processes of learning and teaching namely; subject matter representation, activation of learning and engagement of students with that subject matter content, encouragement of socialization and interaction between and among students, assessment of learning outcomes, and provision of feedback to students...|$|R
5000|$|Morris Library is {{the main}} library for SIU. The Library [...] "Holds more than 3.2 million volumes, 200,000 e-books, 43,000 current {{periodicals}} and serials, and over 3.6 million microform units." [...] These figures make Morris Library among the top 50 research libraries in the United States and the second largest in the state. Library users have access to I-Share (the statewide automated library system) and to a comprehensive array of databases and other electronic data files. As the campus center for access to academic information and collaborative academic technology projects, Morris Library provides {{a wide range of}} services, including reference assistance, instructional and technical support, distance learning, geographic information systems (GIS), and multimedia <b>courseware</b> development. Morris <b>Library</b> {{is a member of the}} Consortium of Academic and Research Libraries in Illinois (CARLI), Association of Research Libraries (ARL), and the Greater Western Library Alliance (GWLA).|$|R
40|$|The use of {{courseware}} {{for information}} skills teaching in academic libraries {{has been growing}} {{for a number of}} years. In order to create effective courseware packages to support joint electronic library activity at Glasgow and Strathclyde Universities, the GAELS project conducted a literature review of the subject. This review discovered a range of factors common to successful <b>library</b> <b>courseware</b> implementations, such as the need for practitioners to feel a sense of ownership of the medium, a need for courseware customization to local information environments, and an emphasis on training packages for large bodies of undergraduates. However, we also noted underdeveloped aspects worthy of further attention, such as treatment of pedagogic issues in library CAL imp lementations and use of hypertextual learning materials for more advanced information skills training. We describe how these findings shaped the packages produced by the project and suggest ways forward for similar types of implementation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – Computer-enhanced {{learning}} {{materials can}} enhance the engineering learning environment {{in a number of}} different ways. However, faculty members are generally hesitant to use materials that have not undergone a proper review process to evaluate the quality of the materials. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a set of quality criteria and methods useful in determining the utility of technologies and materials in helping attain specific course goals. The paper spotlights different types of resources, including digital libraries and assessment research available for faculty to use to locate and select helpful computer-based materials, as well as how to evaluate those materials in relation to their specific course goals. Illustrations will be given of how materials judged to be of high-quality, based on the criteria presented, have been used to improve student learning. Examples are taken from general engineering disciplines and will be relevant and of interest to engineers from all disciplines.
