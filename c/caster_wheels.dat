5|$|The {{carriage}} {{was nearly}} identical to the carriage of the M-30. It had suspension and steel wheels with pneumatic rubber tires. The trails were initially of riveted construction, but were eventually replaced in production by welded ones. Late production pieces were equipped with <b>caster</b> <b>wheels</b> to ease manhandling. Time to set up for combat was about two minutes. In an emergency {{it was possible to}} fire without splitting trails; however this was at the price of a drastically reduced traverse (1°30'). Since the gun was not equipped with a limber, it could be towed only by vehicle. The maximum towing speed was 40km/h on paved roads, 30km/h on cobbled roads and 10km/h off-road. To give the crew some protection from bullets and shell fragments, the gun was fitted with a shield.|$|E

40|$|A {{full-scale}} {{investigation has}} been conducted {{to determine the effect}} of various factors on the shimmy of <b>castering</b> <b>wheels.</b> The factors considered were the geometric arrangement, the tire types, the variations of load, the spindle moment of inertia, and the tire inflation.

The constants needed in the calculations to determine the damping required for a <b>castering</b> <b>wheel</b> were measured.

40|$|In many {{installations}} of <b>castering</b> rubber-tired <b>wheels</b> {{there is}} a tendency for the wheel to oscillate violently about the spindle axis. This phenomenon, popularly called 'shimmy,' has occurred in some airplane tail wheels and has been corrected in two ways: first by the application of friction in the spindles of the tail wheels; and, second, by locking the wheels while taxiing at high speeds. Shimmy is common with the large wheels used as nose wheels in tricycle landing gears and, since it is impossible to lock the wheels, friction in the nose-wheel spindle has been the sole means of correction. Because the nose wheel is larger than the conventional tail wheel and usually carries a greater load, the larger amounts of spindle friction necessary to prevent shimmy are objectionable. the present paper presents a theoretical and experimental study of the problem of the stability of <b>castering</b> <b>wheels</b> for airplane landing gears. On the basis of simplified assumptions induced from experimental observations, a theoretical study has been made of the shimmy of <b>castering</b> <b>wheels.</b> The theory is based on the discovery of a phenomenon called 'kinematic shimmy' and is compared quantitatively with the results of model experiments. Experimental checks, using a model having low-pressure tires, are reported and the applicability of the results to full scale is discussed. Theoretical methods of estimating the spindle viscous damping and spindle solid friction necessary to avoid shimmy - lateral freedom - is introduced...|$|R

50|$|Zero-turn mowers are {{designed}} to cut so closely around obstacles that there's virtually no need to trim. These mowers pivot through 180 degrees without leaving any uncut grass. Maximum lever movement means maximum fluid flow, which translates into a rapidly turning wheel. If one drive wheel turns more rapidly than the other, the machine moves along a curved path. If both wheels turn at the same speed, the machine follows a straight path. If one wheel stops and the other turns, or if the wheels turn in opposite directions, the mower pivots.This drive system {{can be used on}} two different types of zero turn mowers, Mid Mount, where the mower is suspended under a 4 wheel chassis or Out Front, where the mower is terrain following and front mounted.The terrain following models provide a higher level of balance,comfort, safety and performance. The Out-front models utilise a centralised main drive wheel system with front and rear <b>caster</b> <b>wheels.</b> The midmount has front <b>caster</b> <b>wheels</b> and rear drive wheels.
