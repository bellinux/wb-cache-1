5|$|In a {{statement}} on Egyptian state television, Suleiman announced the formation of two independent committees for political and constitutional reforms, both starting work immediately. One <b>committee</b> <b>would</b> carry out constitutional and legislative amendments to enable a shift of power. The other would monitor the implementation of all proposed reforms. Suleiman also stressed that demonstrators would not be prosecuted and that a separate independent fact-finding <b>committee</b> <b>would</b> be established to probe the violence of 2February. He said that wider press freedoms were under consideration {{and that he would}} produce a list of what was needed to hold free elections. He also said that plans were underway to organize a peaceful transfer of power. Suleiman reiterated his view that Egypt was not ready for democracy, while warning of a possible coup d'état unless demonstrators agreed to enter negotiations.|$|E
5|$|It {{was again}} {{proposed}} {{as part of}} the New York City bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics. The City wanted to get funding before July 2005, at which time the International Olympic <b>Committee</b> <b>would</b> vote on funding. However, due to shortfalls in the MTA's Capital Program, as well as preexisting funding for the Second Avenue Subway and East Side Access, the MTA could not pay to fund the extension. After a proposal for the West Side Stadium, an Olympic stadium to be located above the nearby West Side Yard, was rejected in 2005, New York City quickly lost their Olympic bid.|$|E

Just four days later, on November 23, the Lafayette faculty voted {{to turn down the}} bid because the Sun Bowl <b>Committee</b> <b>would</b> not allow Showell to play. This bid {{rejection}} led to a large student demonstration on the Lafayette campus and in the city of Easton against segregation.|$|E

Goldberg had been appointed Secretary of Labor by President John F. Kennedy and used his influence to help McDonald. [...] On January 13, 1961, the Steelworkers announced an agreement in which the Human Relations <b>Committees</b> <b>would</b> be empowered to negotiate on behalf of the union and the steelmakers.

5|$|The San Francisco Citizens' Committee {{wished to}} issue a {{commemorative}} coin as a fundraiser for {{a celebration of the}} statehood diamond jubilee. A California congressman attached authorization for it to another coinage bill, which was approved by Congress in early 1925.

The coin has been widely praised for its beauty in the years since.|$|E
5|$|Both Eisenhower's {{speech to}} the excited crowd and {{telegram}} to his running mate were noncommittal. The general applauded his running mate for his speech, but stated that the two had to meet face to face before a final decision could be made. While Eisenhower affirmed that the RNC {{had the power to}} elect a replacement candidate, Eisenhower indicated that the <b>committee</b> <b>would,</b> most likely, be guided by his wishes. Eisenhower asked Nixon to meet with him in person in Wheeling, West Virginia, where the general's campaign was next scheduled to go. Eisenhower's telegram was delayed in transmission and lost among the flood being sent to Nixon's suite, and the latter learned of his running mate's position from a wire service report.|$|E
5|$|Chandler feared Laffoon, who {{controlled}} the State Democratic Central <b>Committee,</b> <b>would</b> attempt to hand-select the Democratic gubernatorial nominee by calling a nominating convention instead of holding a primary election, {{and he used}} a bold move to circumvent Laffoon's ability to carry out such an action. Under the Kentucky Constitution, Chandler became acting governor any time Laffoon left the state. When Laffoon traveled to meet with President Franklin D. Roosevelt in Washington, D. C. on February 6, 1935, Chandler used his authority to call the legislature into session to consider a bill requiring that each party's gubernatorial candidates be chosen by a primary rather than a nominating convention. Laffoon returned to the state {{the next day and}} challenged Chandler's authority to make the call, but Chandler's actions were validated by the Kentucky Court of Appeals on February 26.|$|E

5|$|Leeman Bennett, {{the former}} {{head coach of the}} Atlanta Falcons and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, served as {{chairman}} of the selection committee, which had the task of picking the best teams from those made available by the selection criteria set by the two conferences. The <b>committee</b> <b>would</b> have approximately onemonth to select the twoteams that would attract the most people to the game and generate the largest possible television audience. This fact helped eliminate ACC runner-up Georgia Tech from the selection process, as the Yellow Jackets had already played Georgia earlier in the season, thus making a potential Georgia-Georgia Tech showdown less attractive. In addition, that matchup, while attractive to football fans in the Atlanta area (the site of the Chick-fil-A Bowl and home to Georgia Tech), would have less appeal to television viewers outside the Georgia area. Supervising the selection committee was the Chick-fil-A Bowl Executive Committee, which consisted of representatives from various Atlanta businesses and the Chick-fil-A corporation.|$|E
5|$|On October 25, 1968, {{a fire at}} {{the former}} {{incinerator}} plant off Route 611, where the Peace Candle was being stored, destroyed the four smaller candles that surround {{the base of the}} larger candle. The fire was believed to have started by someone playing with matches inside the building. Firefighters battled the blaze for more than an hour. Damage was estimated at a cost of $1,200. Initially, city officials announced the fire would not delay the lighting ceremony planned for December 1. However, the Easton Area Christmas Committee had already been debating {{the construction of a new}} Peace Candle prior to the fire. On October 29, Henry Schultz, now chairman of the Christmas committee, announced the four smaller candles were damaged beyond repair and no effort would be made to rebuild them. Instead, the <b>committee</b> <b>would</b> build an entirely new candle within a year.|$|E

She quit the sport after being told that neither insurance nor the Australian Paralympic <b>Committee</b> <b>would</b> cover her against injury during a tour in the United States, as her tendonitis was considered a there, and she would have to pay the costs for injury treatment herself. She quit wheelchair basketball. She had a child, which caused a recurrence of her original illness.|$|E
50|$|The 1988 St Helena Constitution {{took effect}} in 1989 and {{provided}} that the island would be governed by a Governor and Commander-in-Chief, and an Executive and Legislative Council. The Executive Council members would be elected for nomination by the elected members of the Legislative Council, and subsequently appointed by the Governor and could only {{be removed from office}} by the votes of a majority of the five members of the Legislative Council. The Legislative Council Members would be re-elected by the voters every four years. With few exceptions the Governor would be obliged to abide by the advice given to him by the Executive Council. Five Council <b>Committees</b> <b>would</b> be made up from the membership of the Legislative Council and civil servants so that at any time there would always be a majority of elected members.

5|$|Wiesenthal was {{nominated}} for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985, the fortieth anniversary {{of the end of}} the war. Rumour had it that the Nobel <b>Committee</b> <b>would</b> give the prize to a Holocaust-related candidate. Fellow Holocaust survivor and author Elie Wiesel, also nominated, began a campaign in hopes of winning the prize, travelling to France, Ethiopia and Oslo for speaking tours and humanitarian work. Rabbi Hier of the Wiesenthal Center urged Wiesenthal to lobby for the prize as well, but other than delivering a lecture in Oslo, Wiesenthal did little to promote his candidacy. When Wiesel was awarded the 1986 prize, Wiesenthal claimed the World Jewish Congress must have influenced the Committee's decision, a claim the WJC denied. Biographer Tom Segev speculates that the loss may have been because of the negative publicity over the Waldheim affair.|$|E
5|$|An {{extension}} of the Flushing Line was then proposed {{as part of the}} New York City bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics. The City wanted to get funding before July 2005, at which time the International Olympic <b>Committee</b> <b>would</b> vote on funding. However, due to shortfalls in the MTA's Capital Program, as well as preexisting funding for the Second Avenue Subway and East Side Access, the MTA could not pay to fund the extension. After a proposal for the West Side Stadium, an Olympic stadium to be located above the nearby West Side Yard, was rejected in 2005, New York City quickly lost their Olympic bid. However, in a report entitled No. 7 Subway Extension– Hudson Yards Rezoning and Development Program, the government of New York City, devised a rezoning plan for the Hudson Yards area and proposed two new subway stations to serve that area. The subway extension was approved following the successful rezoning of about 60 blocks from 28th to 43rd Streets, which became the Hudson Yards neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|During the 30th {{session of}} the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee in November 1997, a {{proposal}} was put forward by Hong Kong to give Asian typhoons local names and to stop using the European and American names {{that had been used}} since 1945. The committee's Training and Research Coordination Group was subsequently tasked to consult with members and work out the details of the scheme in order to present a list of names for approval at the 31st session. During August 1998, the group met and decided that each member of the <b>committee</b> <b>would</b> be invited to contribute ten names to the list and that five principles would be followed for the selection of names. It was also agreed that each name would have to be approved by each member and that a single objection would be enough to veto a name. A list of 140 names was subsequently drawn up and submitted to the Typhoon Committee's 32nd session, who after a lengthy discussion approved the list and decided to implement it on January 1, 2000. It was also decided that the Japan Meteorological Agency would name the systems rather than the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.|$|E

5|$|From {{the summer}} of 1940, the Committee became {{increasingly}} divided between the members keen for closer collaboration with the Germans, led by Victor Leemans, and those who wished to remain strictly within the proscribed Belgian legal framework, led by Ernst de Bunswyck. In October 1940, the Germans were able to pass fundamental changes to the system of regional Burgomasters in the country though the Committee without resistance. The Committee had announced in October 1940 that it would refuse to enforce anti-Jewish legislation, but did not resist their implementation by the military government. The Committee's ambivalent stance meant that Belgian policemen and civil servants were not instructed to refuse to participate in rounding-up of Jews {{as part of the}} Final Solution from 1942. Tensions grew between the Germans and the committee in December 1940, and in early 1941 the Germans reshuffled the committee; appointing more pro-Nazi members. From March 1941, {{it became clear that the}} <b>Committee</b> <b>would</b> no longer be able to resist German demands, even those clearly violating the Hague Convention.|$|E
5|$|The {{cases of}} Taylor and Marshall were {{appealed to the}} Kentucky Court of Appeals, then to the Supreme Court of the United States. In the case of Taylor v. Beckham, Bradley countered Democrats' claims that the federal courts should not have {{jurisdiction}} by citing Thayer v. Boyd, a similar {{case in which the}} court had assumed jurisdiction. He further quoted authorities who opined that an elected office was property, using this to contend that Taylor's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment had been violated, thus giving the court jurisdiction. Also, Bradley asserted, the election of some members of the General Assembly's contest <b>committee</b> <b>would</b> hinge on the decision of that very committee. At least one member of the committee was known to have wagered on the election's outcome. These facts should have nullified the decision of the committee and the Assembly {{on the grounds that it}} had left some members as judges of their own cases, Bradley argued. Finally, Bradley cited irregularities in the proceedings of the contest committee, including giving insufficient time for the review of testimony provided in written form by Taylor and Marshall's legal representation. The court refused to intervene in the case, however, because it found that there were no federal questions involved. The lone justice dissenting from that opinion was Kentuckian John Marshall Harlan.|$|E
5|$|Two rule {{changes were}} made for the 79th Academy Awards {{in regard to the}} Best Foreign Language Film process. The first was instituting a two-step process in {{choosing}} the nominees for the award in order to allow New York-based members of the Academy to participate. An initial <b>committee</b> <b>would</b> select nine films to form a shortlist in January that would then be reviewed by a committee composed of ten members of the initial committee, ten Los Angeles-based members, and ten New York-based members that would select the final five nominees. The second change was the removal of a rule requiring that the films be in an official language of the submitting country. This was done in response to the rejection of Italy's and Austria's submissions for the 78th Academy Awards, Private and Caché respectively, because they were not filmed in the official language of their respective countries. This allowed for the acceptance of submissions such as Canada's Water, which contained solely Hindi dialogue. Following the revealing of the shortlist, the Academy released a list of the five nominees on January 23, 2007. The winner of the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film was Germany's The Lives of Others, which was directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck.|$|E

5|$|When Maxwell {{concluded}} his argument, ex-Governor Bradley {{spoke on}} Taylor's behalf.

He further quoted authorities who opined that an elected office was property, using this to contend that Taylor's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment had been violated, thus giving the court jurisdiction.

5|$|During {{his first}} term as mayor, Armstrong oversaw many issues that {{concerned}} the city. In March 1911, he expressed his support for a new city hall building to be built, expressing his dissatisfaction with the existing building that housed the council and civic employees, mentioning the ever-expanding number of staff. Later in that year, a <b>committee</b> <b>would</b> be formed concerning the issue, and a new structure would be planned with a planned cost of one million dollars. In July of that same year, he would sign a bylaw that would allow an American entrepreneur to establish a gas plant in the city, an issue that had been presented to council for debate several months prior. Later that year, {{the prospect of a}} municipal gas plant would also be supplied to city council. In July 1911, when, along with the city council, he dismissed a pair of city commissioners after months of debate. The firing triggered a by-election when alderman James H. McKinley would resign in protest to the action. In 1911, he also served as {{a vice president of the}} Union of Alberta Municipalities. Involved in national and provincial affairs, he voiced his support for a canal to be constructed in the Georgian Bay of Lake Huron, stating that the presence of such canal would improve the trading relations of Canada with the United States by allowing an easier route between the two countries. He also was in favour of a hydroelectric project in the Athabasca River.
