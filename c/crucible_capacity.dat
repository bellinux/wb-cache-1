40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} Ti-addition to High Chromium Cast Iron (HCCI) {{on the structure}} and selected mechanical properties. For this study casted two sets of cylinders with dimensions ø 20 mm, ø 15 mm × 250 mm, for the High Chromium Cast Iron (HCCI) and with the 4 % by mass Ti-addition. Melts were performed in the induction furnace <b>crucible</b> <b>capacity</b> of 15 kg. During the heats the cup with installed S type thermocouple was poured to record the cooling curves. The cylinders were subjected to the static bending strength test. Samples for the test microstructure and Rockwell hardness were cut from the cylinders. The study shows that the addition of titanium {{had an impact on}} the structure and thus the properties of High Chromium Cast Iron (HCCI). In subsequent studies, through an appropriate choice of chemical composition and proper process control, it is planned to obtain in the structure the titanium carbides TiC and chromium carbides with type (Cr, Fe) 7 C 3...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn the {{aluminium}} industry, Hot Metal Carriers (HMCs) {{perform the}} task of transporting molten aluminium from the smelter (where the aluminium is made) to the casting shed where it is turned into block products. The vehicles weigh approximately 20 tonnes unloaded and resemble forklifts except they have a dedicated hook for manipulating the load, called the crucible. In {{the perspective of a}} full automation of this kind of vehicle, this paper main contribution is the implementation of robust outdoor <b>crucible</b> handling <b>capacities,</b> relying on the autonomous tracking of especially designed fiducials attached to the crucible handle...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{feedstock}} amount {{over the}} solar cells final cost, {{the production of}} low-cost and high quality Si in photovoltaic application is a main topic in PV industrial research. The large grained columnar poly crystalline Silicon obtained via Directional Solidification Systems (DSS) {{was found to be}} a convenient alternative to the expensive mono crystal obtained via Czochralski: production costs are much lower and the solar cells efficiency is significantly increased in comparison with the ones obtained via traditional growth. Among the main manufacturers of DSS systems the traditional resistance heating is used both in the phase of melting the raw Silicon and in the phase of re-crystallization {{in order to maintain the}} proper temperature gradient between the top and the bottom of the crucible. The induction heating technology could be a valid option, but only few manufacturers use it. In the paper a comparison between the two different technologies used in DSS for the production of columnar poly Si ingots will be presented and discussed: electric resistors and induction furnaces. The former is a well known and widely used technology. The latter is increasing in the last years. Pros and cons are considered for both systems: energy consumption during the whole process, heating up time, melting time, controlled cooling strategies, process regulation and global efficiencies are evaluated using electromagnetic and thermal simulations. The models used are based on real <b>crucibles</b> <b>capacity</b> in order to simulate processes and to compare the two different approaches. In collaboration with an Italian induction heating company a real iDSS prototype has been built and the process is going to be tested...|$|R
