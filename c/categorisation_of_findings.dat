40|$|Research {{exploring}} {{the role of}} spatial frequencies in rapid stimulus detection and categorisation report flexible reliance on specific spatial frequency bands. Here, {{through a set of}} behavioural and magnetoencephalography (MEG) experiments, we investigated the role of low spatial frequency (LSF) ( 25 cpf) information during the <b>categorisation</b> <b>of</b> faces and places. Reaction time measures revealed significantly faster <b>categorisation</b> <b>of</b> faces driven by LSF information, while rapid <b>categorisation</b> <b>of</b> places was facilitated by HSF information. The MEG study showed significantly earlier latency of the M 170 component for LSF faces compared to HSF faces. Moreover, the M 170 amplitude was larger for LSF faces than for LSF places, whereas the reverse pattern was evident for HSF faces and places. These results suggest that spatial frequency modulates the processing of category specific information for faces and places...|$|R

40|$|Commercial {{capital markets}} {{have started to}} {{recognise}} that the context of investment must be considered, this is seen via the widespread adoption of the United Nation’s Principals for Responsible Investment. Impact Investing, has developed into a recognised mechanism for achieving a triple bottom line returns (financial returns, social returns, and environmental returns). Governments are recognising the benefits of this capital resource, by structuring policy to attract capital towards achieving impact. Private equity impact investing is a new alternative asset class that {{is regarded as a}} highly efficient instrument for allocating capital whilst achieving impact. This paper investigates the factors that are influencing Private Equity Impact Investing in South Africa, and it provides an exploratory investigation into the landscape of public policy that affects this asset class. This research is relevant through identifying trends and best practice for Private Equity Impact Investing in emerging markets, and evaluating their suitability for adoption in South Africa. This study was a qualitative study using data collected via 16 semi-structured interviews. These interviews included 8 private equity fund managers, 4 investment intermediaries, and 4 policy makers. The data was processed {{with the use of a}} computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software. Thematic coded analysis was performed on the data, and relationships were defined in accordance with the <b>categorisation</b> <b>of</b> themes. <b>Findings</b> were triangulated to ensure validity. The research found that whilst Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment provided an opportunity for targeted investment, it has the potential for expansion to incorporate additional impact areas. The poor implementation of policy by government agencies is resulting in failure to effectively feed soft capital into the investment spectrum, thereby creating a gap in the capital continuum. This has resulted in a shortfall in investment in SME and VC, thereby inhibiting the pipeline for Private Equity Impact InvestmentDissertation (MBA) [...] University of Pretoria, 2014. zkgibs 2015 Gordon Institute of Business Science (GIBS) Unrestricte...|$|R

Because of the continuous {{character of the}} colour spectrum, colour terms constitute an interesting material to study linguistic categorisation. The {{first part of this}} article offers a review of research on the linguistic <b>categorisation</b> <b>of</b> colours, especially on basic colour terms and prototypes. In the second part, the results of an empirical study on the basicness of French colour terms will be presented. The results suggest that colour terms are categorised as prototypically structured concepts, which supports the hypothesis of the relative basicness of colour terms...|$|R
