40|$|OBJECTIVES: (1) To {{examine the}} {{relation}} between concentrations of cadmium (<b>Cd)</b> <b>in</b> rice and urinary concentrations of indicators of renal dysfunction and the prevalence of abnormalities in urine in areas polluted by Cd. (2) To establish the maximum allowable concentration of <b>Cd</b> <b>in</b> rice from these findings. METHODS: The target population consisted of 1703 inhabitants (832 men and 871 women) aged over 50 years who consumed home grown rice and {{had lived in the}} same hamlet in areas polluted by <b>Cd</b> <b>in</b> the Kakehashi River basin in Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan for at least 30 years. The correlation coefficients between concentrations of <b>Cd</b> <b>in</b> rice and several urinary substances, the prevalence of abnormalities in urine and sex in hamlets polluted by Cd were calculated. Finally, regression analysis was performed for significant indicators to calculate the maximum allowable concentration of <b>Cd</b> <b>in</b> rice based on values in a control group. CONCLUSIONS: Significant correlations between concentration of <b>Cd</b> <b>in</b> rice and concentrations of urinary beta 2 -microglobulin, metallothionein, glucose, and aminonitrogen were established. Similarly, there were significant correlations between concentration of <b>Cd</b> <b>in</b> rice and the prevalence of beta 2 -microglobulinuria, metallothioneinuria, glucosuria, proteinuria, proteinuria with glucosuria, and aminonitrogenuria.

40|$|Cadmium (Cd) is a non-essential {{trace element}} and its {{environmental}} concentrations are increasing due to human activities. Edible plants can accumulate {{high concentrations of}} Cd, which could be toxic to humans. Understanding how and where <b>Cd</b> is stored <b>in</b> plants is important for ensuring lower concentration of <b>Cd</b> <b>in</b> the food. In this thesis, the accumulation and distribution of <b>Cd</b> <b>in</b> three agricultural plants, namely lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and radish (Raphanus sativus L.), were investigated {{with a focus on}} the potential mechanisms involved in the localization of <b>Cd</b> <b>in</b> the root. The main objectives of the study were: (1) to understand the effect of transpiration on <b>Cd</b> accumulation <b>in</b> lettuce, barley and radish, (2) to investigate the role of phytochelatins <b>in</b> <b>Cd</b> distribution <b>in</b> lettuce and barley, and (3) to determine the localization of <b>Cd</b> <b>in</b> the roots of lettuce and barley. The plants were grown hydroponically and analyzed using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry, high performance liquid chromatography, and a combination of histochemistry and light microscopy, energy dispersive spectrometry, wavelength dispersive spectrometry, and x-ray fluorescence microscopy. The result showed that radish was sensitive to Cd and did not survive beyond 1. 0 µM Cd. Below this concentration, radish accumulated negligible amounts of <b>Cd</b> <b>in</b> the edible organ (tap root) and was considered to have low risk of toxicity to consumers. Of the other species, barley accumulated more <b>Cd</b> <b>in</b> the root compared to lettuce, which was related to the ability of barley to retain more <b>Cd</b> <b>in</b> the root and possible redistribution of Cd from the shoot to the root via a phloem-mediated pathway. Barley provided more effective barriers against radial flow of Cd to the stele in the root and synthesized more phytochelatins and their precursor peptides in the root, which possibly immobilized <b>Cd</b> <b>in</b> the cytoplasm. Lettuce had most of its root Cd bound to the cell wall and the flow of Cd to the stele was less interrupted. This knowledge will be useful in designing or engineering plants with lower concentrations of <b>Cd</b> <b>in</b> the edible organs...|$|R

5|$|Carbon-14 (C) is a {{naturally}} occurring radioisotope, {{created in the}} upper atmosphere (lower stratosphere and upper troposphere) by interaction of nitrogen with cosmic rays. It is found in trace amounts on Earth of up to 1 part per trillion (0.0000000001%), mostly confined to the atmosphere and superficial deposits, particularly of peat and other organic materials. This isotope decays by 0.158MeV β emission. Because of its relatively short half-life of 5730years, C is virtually absent in ancient rocks. The amount of <b>C</b> <b>in</b> the atmosphere and in living organisms is almost constant, but decreases predictably in their bodies after death.
