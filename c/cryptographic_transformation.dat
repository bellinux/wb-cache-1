S-boxes bring nonlinearity to cryptosystems and strengthen their cryptographic security.

The main goal {{of this paper is to}} find ways to increase performance of <b>cryptographic</b> <b>transformation</b> with public key by increasing performance of integers squaring.

As a result, it became possible to perform addition of such products in the column independently of each other. However, independent accumulation of products and carries require correction of the intermediate results to account for the accumulated carries. Due to the independence of accumulation in the columns, it became possible to parallelize the process of products accumulation that allowed formulating several approaches. In this paper received theoretical estimates of the computational complexity for proposed squaring algorithms.

40|$|There {{is a new}} {{approach}} to determine the degree of cryptographic S-boxes suitability. This approach is based on estimating the number of transformation cycles required for a cipher to achieve differential and linear nature of the state typical for random substitution of the appropriate degree. The paper presents the results of experiments to determine the differential and linear indicators of the Heys cipher (a cipher with a weak linear transformation) and a reduced model of the Rijndael cipher (the cipher with a strong linear transformation), using nibble S-boxes with different values of the XOR table differences maxima and linear approximations table displacements. It is demonstrated that, contrary to widely-known approach that links cipher performance indicators with strength indicators of substitutions that they use, the resistance to cipher attacks by means of linear and differential cryptanalysis (maximum differential and linear probabilities) does not depend on S-boxes used. It is concluded that random substitutions can be used as the S-block designs without compromising the performance of cryptographic ciphers. It means that the search for S-boxes with high encryption performance (at least for ciphers with strong linear transformations) is an unpromising task. At the same time it is shown that a good cipher can not be built without a nonlinear transformation.

In the proposed solution operation system integrity check is made by hardware-software module, including USB-token with protected memory for secure storage of cryptographic keys and loader. The key requirement for the solution is mutual authentication of four participants: terminal server, thin client, token and user. We have created two algorithms for the problem solution. The first of the designed algorithms compares the encrypted one-time password (random number) with the reference value stored {{in the memory of}} the token and updates this number in case of successful authentication. The second algorithm uses the public and private keys of the token and the server.

To ensure {{confidentiality}} {{a document}} is usually encrypted by a symmetric key encryption algorithm. The {{use of a}} symmetric key encryption algorithm makes it necessary to distribute the used common encryption/decryption key. A possible decision is to use an asymmetric encryption algorithm to hide a session symmetric encryption key. However in many cases another decision is more appropriate consisting {{in the establishment of}} a shared secret key as needed by performing a set of cryptographic operations in a dialogue. A secure establishment of a shared secret key requires a mutual authentication of communicating parties. Algorithms of this type are basic components of network security tools including Internet protocols Ssl/tsl and Ipsec. Most shared key establishment algorithms are based on the Diffie-Hellmann algorithm. In its original design this algorithm does not provide the authentication of parties and thus is vulnerable to cryptanalytic attacks using the violation of authenticity. The shared key establishment algorithm should also guarantee the strength exceeding that of the symmetric encryption algorithm in use. A natural approach is to design such an algorithm on cryptographic transformations in the group of points of the properly chosen elliptic curves. The presented algorithm of shared secret key establishment is based on the <b>cryptographic</b> <b>transformation</b> defined in the national standard of Ukraine DSTU 4145 - 2002 ?Information technology. Cryptographic techniques. Digital signatures based on elliptic curves. Generation and verification?, and cryptographic standards which operate in Ukraine.

The algorithm is intended for a real time computation of a shared secret key by two parties of information exchange the size of which is determined the hash function in use. The computed secret key is used to initialize an algorithm of symmetric encryption. ?????????????????? ????????? ?????????????? ??????????? ????????? ? ??????? ????????? ?????????? ??????. ??? ??????? ??????? ????????? ????? ?????????? ????? ???? ?????? ???????? ????????????? ??????????. ????????????? ????????????? ????????? ?????????? ??????? ? ?????????????? ??????? ???????? ????????????? ????????? ?????? ??????????. ????? ?? ????????? ??????? ???? ????????????? ????????? ?????????????? ??????????, ??????? ????????? ??????? ???? ????????????? ??????????, ?????? ? ???????? ???????? ?????? ? ???????? ??????? ????? ?????? ???????, ??????? ???????? ?????? ??????????? ? ????? ?????????, ?????????? ????? ????????? ???? ? ?? ????????????? ?????????? ??? ? ?????? ????????????? ???????????? ????? ????? ???? ? ??????? ?? ????????????? ?????? ?????? ?????. ?? ????? ???????????? ?????? ?????????? ????? ??????????? ?????? ?????????????? ??????????? ?????? ??????????????? ??????. ????????? ????? ???? ???????? ??????????? ????????? ?????? ???????? ?? ??? ????? ??????? ?????? ???????? ? ???? ????????, ? ?????? ??????????

As an aftermath of published weaknesses and vulnerabilities in Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), IEEE 802. 11 interim security solution based on Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) accommodates the existing WEP hardware by upgrading the software or firmware. However, the proposed long-term security solution is based on Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) CCM (Counter Mode, Cipher Block Chaining, Message Authentication Code), which definitely entails hardware upgradation.

40|$|To achieve {{pervasive}} secure {{information processing}} over the public wired and wireless Internet, {{it is desirable}} {{to be able to}} perform <b>cryptographic</b> <b>transformations</b> rapidly and conveniently. The performance of software-implemented cryptographic functions is hampered by certain operations which have not been optimized in the Instruction Set Architecture of processors, due to their infrequency in earlier programming workloads. One such operation is the permutation of bits within a block to be encrypted, which is particularly difficult in word-oriented processors. This paper introduces four novel permutation instructions and the underlying methodology for performing arbitrary n-bit permutations efficiently in programmable processors. While targeted at solving the more difficult problem of permuting n 1 -bit elements, we also address the issue of permuting a smaller number of multi-bit subwords packed into an n-bit word, a feature needed to accelerate multimedia processing in software. By providing the ability to do fast permutations in software, we open the field for new cryptography and multimedia algorithms using these powerful yet simple permutation primitives. This results in much faster cryptography and multimedia processing, while retaining the flexibility of software implementations, for secure multimedia information appliances and servers...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cryptographic</b> <b>transformations</b> are a {{fundamental}} building block in many security applications and protocols. To improve performance, several vendors market hardware accelerator cards. However, until now no operating system provided a mechanism that allowed both uniform and {{efficient use of}} this new type of resource. We present the OpenBSD Cryptographic Framework (OCF), a service virtualization layer implemented inside the kernel, that provides uniform access to accelerator functionality by hiding card-specific details behind a carefully-designed API. We evaluate {{the impact of the}} OCF in a variety of benchmarks, measuring overall system performance, application throughput and latency, and aggregate throughput when multiple applications make use of it. We conclude that the OCF is extremely efficient in utilizing cryptographic accelerator functionality, attaining 95 % of the theoretical peak device performance, and over 800 Mbit/sec aggregate throughput using 3 DES. We believe that this validates our decision to opt for ease of use by applications and kernel components through a uniform API, and for seamless support for new accelerators. Furthermore, our evaluation points to several bottlenecks in system and operating system design: data copying between user and kernel modes, PCI bus signaling inefficiency, protocols that use small data units, and single-threaded applications. We offer several suggestions for improvements and directions for future work...|$|R
