40|$|Epichloë species (Clavicipitaceae, Ascomycota) are {{the causal}} agents of <b>choke</b> <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> <b>grasses.</b> This disease is {{characterized}} by the presence of cylindrical fungal stromata which wrap the immature inflorescences and inhibit the normal development of reproductive tillers. Using phenotypic and molecular characters, as well as mating compatibility tests, the fungus causing choke disease in Brachypodium phoenicoides (Poaceae) was identified as Epichloë typhina. A three year field experiment conducted with infected and uninfected plants of a single clone of B. phoenicoides showed no significant differences in biomass production during their vegetative growth stage, but the content of Ca, Mg, and Mn was greater, and that of Na was lower in infected plants compared to uninfected plants. Infected plants produced up to twice as many reproductive tillers than healthy plants, but their reproductive tissue biomass was smaller than that of healthy plants, because tiller development was arrested by choke forming stromata.

Those surveyed were in 4 groups: 2 producer associations located around Queensland provincial centres (Mackay and Gympie); and 2 producer / researcher organisations with member-ship spread across the whole of northern Australia. People in each group filled a range of occupations, with producers (graziers) and agri-cultural scientists prominently represented. Overall, there was a 55 % response to the survey with the response rate ranging from 36 to 73 % across the 4 groups. There were 4 topics where there was a clear-cut view by all groups, occupations and regions: reduced government and industry funding for pasture research and cost of establishment were rated as severe constraints, while <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> <b>grasses</b> was rated least limiting. Topics which had clear viewpoints for most groups included the cost of maintaining pastures, unreliable cli-mate and uncertain commodity prices. The least limiting factors were: availability <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> culti-vars, <b>diseases</b> and pests <b>of</b> <b>grasses</b> and legumes, and lack of technical information. There were significant differences between groups and between people in different occupa-tions on many issues, but few significant differ-ences between regions.

40|$|SUMMARY: The labyrinthula {{isolates}} of Watson {{will grow}} {{over a wide}} range of pH values in a medium of which the inorganic constituents reflect their marine origin. All are obligately marine, though the less exacting requirements of L. macro-cystis var. atlunticu suggest an estuarine habitat. Although only L. rninuta var. atlantica requires an amino acid (L-leucine) as a growth factor, no isolate grew well on substrates other than amino acids. All require thiamine. Organic requirements may be obtained from host plants. Labyrinthula Cienkowski (1863) is a genus of uncertain affinities, usually considered among the Myxomycetes. It is best known as including the probable causative organism <b>of</b> the wasting <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> eel <b>grass,</b> Zostera marina (Renn, 1935). Pure cultures of some members of the genus Labyrinthula have only recently been isolated by Dr S. W. Watson (to be published).

40|$|Although cereal crops all {{belong to}} the grass family (Poacea), most <b>of</b> their <b>diseases</b> are {{specific}} to a particular species. Thus, a given cereal species is typically resistant to <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> other <b>grasses,</b> and this nonhost resistance is generally stable. To determine the feasibility of transferring nonhost resistance genes (R genes) between distantly related grasses to control specific diseases, we identified a maize R gene that recognizes a rice pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola, which causes bacterial streak disease. Bacterial streak is an important <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> rice in Asia, and no simply inherited sources of resistance {{have been identified in}} rice. Although X. o. pv. oryzicola does not cause disease on maize, we identified a maize gene, Rxo 1, that conditions a resistance reaction to a diverse collection of pathogen strains. Surprisingly, Rxo 1 also controls resistance to the unrelated pathogen Burkholderia andropogonis, which causes bacterial stripe of sorghum and maize. The same gene thus controls resistance reactions to both pathogens and nonpathogens of maize. Rxo 1 has a nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat structure, similar to many previously identified R genes. Most importantly, Rxo 1 functions after transfer as a transgene to rice, demonstrating the feasibility of nonhost R gene transfer between cereals and providing a valuable tool for controlling bacterial streak disease...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Plant Pathology, Washington State UniversityThe 140 {{species of}} Tilletia (Ustilaginomycotina, Basidiomycota) are biotrophic {{pathogens}} that cause bunt and smut <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> <b>grasses</b> (Poaceae). Among the most economically important species are the wheat bunt pathogens, T. caries, T. contraversa, and T. laevis. Most smut fungi infect relatively few hosts, but the host range of T. contraversa includes 65 species in 17 grass genera. The {{objective of this}} study was to incorporate sequence data from ITS rDNA, eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 -alpha (EF 1 -alpha), and the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB 2) with three anonymous loci (A 13, A 16 and P 18) to elucidate relationships and test the host range of the wheat bunt fungi and related Tilletia species infecting cool-season grasses in the Pacific Northwestern U. S. Sorus shape and teliospore size of 60 dwarf and common bunt isolates analyzed with k-means clustering revealed two groups, one largely corresponding to common bunt and the second to dwarf bunt. Network analysis based on three anonymous loci and RBP 2 region revealed three clades, but none of the clades contained isolates of all three species. Phylogenetic analyses of the three anonymous loci, EF 1 -alpha, ITS rDNA and RPB 2 were used to test the conspecific status of Eurasian and North American isolates of T. contraversa infecting species <b>of</b> nine <b>grass</b> genera. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed independently for RPB 2 /ITS/EF 1 -alpha and A 16 /P 18 /ITS/EF 1 -alpha loci. NeighborNet networks were estimated from A 16 /P 18 /ITS/EF 1 -alpha loci and compared with the NeighborNet networks constructed with "gene-jackknifing" method. All phylogenetic trees and networks suggested a wide host range for T. contraversa. The analyses failed to support dwarf bunt pathogen as genetically distinct from the common bunt pathogens, but Eurasian isolates of T. contraversa on Elymus repens and Thinopyrum intermedium were consistently placed in a clade distinct from the majority of T. contraversa isolates, suggesting that substructure exists among isolates in this group. In contrast to the broad host range supported for T. contraversa, phylogenetic analysis of Tilletia species on cool-season grasses based on ITS, EF 1 -alpha and RPB 2 revealed well-supported clades corresponding to host.

Virus-like particles present in extracts of diseased plants were unstable, 50 - 70 nm in diameter, had a core and outer coat and were morphologically similar to particles of viruses in the genus Fijivirus, family Reoviridae. The particles were shown by immune electron microscopy to be serologically closely related to pangola stunt and maize rough dwarf viruses, but unrelated to oat sterile dwarf virus. Similar virus-like particles were observed in crystalline arrays in ultrathin sections of cells in vein enations of D. ciliaris.

The pathogen severely impairs the growth <b>of</b> Napier <b>grass,</b> the major fodder for dairy cattle in Eastern Africa. NSD is associated with biomass losses of up to 70 % of infected plants. Diagnosis of NSD is done by nested PCR targeting the phytoplasma DNA, which is difficult to perform in developing countries with little infrastructure. We report {{the development of an}} easy to use, rapid, sensitive and specific molecular assay for field diagnosis of NSD. The procedure is based on recombinase polymerase amplification and targets the imp gene encoding a pathogen-specific immunodominant membrane protein. Therefore we followed a two-step process. First we developed an isothermal DNA amplification method for real time fluorescence application and then transferred this assay to a lateral flow format. The limit of detection for both procedures was estimated to be 10 organisms. We simplified the template preparation procedure by using freshly squeezed phloem sap from Napier grass. Additionally, we developed a laboratory serological assay with the potential to be converted to a lateral flow assay. Two murine monoclonal antibodies with high affinity and specificity to the immunodominant membrane protein IMP of Candidatus Phytoplasma oryzae were generated. Both antibodies specifically reacted with the denatured or native 17 kDa IMP protein. In dot blot experiments of extracts from infected plant, phytoplasmas were detected in as little as 12, 5 μg of fresh plant material. Peer Revie...|$|R

40|$|Bermuda grass white leaf (BGWL) is a {{destructive}} phytoplasmal <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> Bermuda <b>grass</b> (Cynodon dactylon), {{which is known}} to occur in several Asian countries, Sudan, Italy, Cuba and Australia. The causal agent, the BGWL phytoplasma, which {{is a member of}} the phylogenetic BGWL phytoplasma group or 16 SrXIV group, is a discrete taxon at the putative species level, for which the name ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma cynodontis’ had previously been proposed. In advanced stages <b>of</b> the <b>disease,</b> BGWL-affected plants show a general and marked bleaching of leaves and usually die within a few months after appearance of the first symptoms. For sensitive detection of BGWL phytoplasma, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays using universal phytoplasma primers, all directed to rDNA, are widely employed. The BGWL pathogen can clearly be differentiated from closely related agents, which include mainly phytoplasmas infecting other gramineous species, by by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of PCR-amplified rDNA using several restriction endonucleases. Also, specific detection of BGWL phytoplasma is possible by using a reverse primer derived from the 16 S- 23 S rDNA spacer sequence of this pathogen. Detection of BGWL phytoplasma by serological methods has also been reported. However, because serology-based techniques are less sensitive than PCR procedures, they are still not widely employed for diagnostic purposes. The use of healthy plant material and roguing of infected plants are the only measures available for reducing the incidence of BGWL phytoplasma in areas where Bermuda grass is grown as cultivated species.

Taxonomic {{separation}} of T. phacorrhiza, T. incarnata and T. ishikariensis was investigated using RAPD, ITS-RFLP and nucleotide sequencing of the ITS region. Using 10 RAPD primers on genomic DNA or eight restriction enzymes on PCR-amplified ITS regions, banding patterns were generated {{for each of}} 19 isolates from five species or varieties. Polymorphisms were found between species and varieties, with fewer among isolates within species or varieties. RAPD analysis suggested that T. ishikariensis var. idahoensis may be distinct from the other varieties (var. ishikariensis and var. canadensis), although this was not supported by ITS-RFLP. To confirm relationships, ITS nucleotides were obtained from single isolates {{of each of the}} five Typhula taxa, and sequence alignments were subjected to distance and parsimony analysis. Although there were differences in branching between dendrograms derived from sequencing vs. RAPD or ITS-RFLP, sequence data supported the distinction of the three main Typhula species, with the T. ishikariensis varieties grouping together and showing differences at an infraspecific level. ITS sequence data also indicated the closer taxonomic affinity of Typhula species to the agaricoid Tricholoma sejunctum compared to the clavarioid Thelephora terrestris.
