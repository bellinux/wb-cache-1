Each configuration has different characteristics.|$|E
25|$|The h {{refers to}} its being an h-parameter, {{a set of}} {{parameters}} named for their origin in a hybrid equivalent circuit model. F is from forward current amplification also called the current gain. E refers to the transistor operating in a <b>common</b> <b>emitter</b> (CE) configuration.

25|$|One set of classifications for {{amplifiers}} {{is based}} on which device terminal is common to both the input and the output circuit. In the case of bipolar junction transistors, the three classes are <b>common</b> <b>emitter,</b> common base, and common collector. For field-effect transistors, the corresponding configurations are common source, common gate, and common drain; for vacuum tubes, common cathode, common grid, and common plate.|$|E

50|$|Common-emitter {{amplifiers}} {{are also}} used in radio frequency circuits, for example to amplify faint signals received by an antenna. In this case {{it is common to}} replace the load resistor with a tuned circuit. This may be done to limit the bandwidth to a narrow band centered around the intended operating frequency. More importantly it also allows the circuit to operate at higher frequencies as the tuned circuit can be used to resonate any inter-electrode and stray capacitances, which normally limit the frequency response. <b>Common</b> <b>emitters</b> are also commonly used as low-noise amplifiers.|$|R
50|$|Sziklai pairs {{are often}} used in the output stages of power {{amplifiers}} due to their advantages both in linearity and bandwidth when compared with more <b>common</b> Darlington <b>emitter</b> follower output stages. They are especially advantageous in amplifiers where the intended load {{does not require the}} use of parallel devices.|$|R
25|$|The <b>common</b> <b>emitter</b> (or common source, common cathode, etc.) is {{most often}} {{configured}} to provide amplification of a voltage applied between base and emitter, and the output signal taken between collector and emitter is inverted, relative to the input. The common collector arrangement applies the input voltage between base and collector, and to take the output voltage between emitter and collector. This causes negative feedback, and the output voltage tends to follow the input voltage. This arrangement is also used as the input presents a high impedance and does not load the signal source, though the voltage amplification is less than one. The common-collector circuit is, therefore, better known as an emitter follower, source follower, or cathode follower.|$|E
25|$|The {{negative}} feedback into the difference amplifier allows the amplifier {{to compare the}} input to the actual output. The amplified signal from Q1 is directly fed to the second stage, Q3, which is a <b>common</b> <b>emitter</b> stage that provides further amplification of the signal and the DC bias for the output stages, Q4 and Q5. R6 provides the load for Q3 (a better design would probably use some form of active load here, such as a constant-current sink). So far, all of the amplifier is operating in class A. The output pair are arranged in class-AB push–pull, also called a complementary pair. They provide {{the majority of the}} current amplification (while consuming low quiescent current) and directly drive the load, connected via DC-blocking capacitor C2. The diodes D1 and D2 provide a small amount of constant voltage bias for the output pair, just biasing them into the conducting state so that crossover distortion is minimized. That is, the diodes push the output stage firmly into class-AB mode (assuming that the base-emitter drop of the output transistors is reduced by heat dissipation).|$|E
500|$|The circuit shown {{consists}} of two stages of amplifier in <b>common</b> <b>emitter</b> topology. [...] The bias resistors all serve their usual functions. [...] The input of the first stage is coupled in the conventional way with a series capacitor to avoid affecting the bias. [...] However, the collector load {{consists of}} a transformer which serves as the inter-stage coupling instead of capacitors. [...] The windings of the transformer have inductance. [...] Capacitors placed across the transformer windings form resonant circuits which provide the tuning of the amplifier.|$|E
40|$|A {{temperature}} responsive transmitter {{is provided}} in which frequency varies linearly with temperature. The transmitter includes two identically biased transistors connected in parallel. A capacitor, which reflects into the common bases to generate negative resistance effectively in parallel with the capacitor, {{is connected to the}} <b>common</b> <b>emitters.</b> A crystal is effectively in parallel with the capacitor and the negative resistance. Oscillations occur if the magnitude of the absolute value of the negative resistance is less than the positive resistive impedance of the capacitor and the inductance of the crystal. The crystal has a large linear temperature coefficient and a resonant frequency which is substantially less than the gain-bandwidth product of the transistors to ensure that the crystal primarily determines the frequency of oscillation. A high-Q tank circuit having an inductor and a capacitor is connected to the common collectors to increase the collector current flow which in turn enhances the radiation of the oscillator frequency by the inductor...|$|R
50|$|At <b>common</b> mode, the <b>emitter</b> voltage {{follows the}} input voltage variations; {{there is a}} full {{negative}} feedback and the gain is minimum.

40|$|The wide {{bandwidth}} in the unlicensed 60 GHz band enable short range wireless data transfer {{in the order}} of tens of gigabit per second. This, combined with the relatively low-cost, very high performance SiGe fabrication processes, has led to a feasibility study of a 60 GHz transceiver at Heidelberg University. Such a wireless system is useful in very many applications, and is proposed as the read-out of the future upgraded trackers in the ATLAS detector in the Large Hadron Collider. The work presented here is the design of the power amplifier block in the transceiver. The power amplifier design consists of three cascaded stages of <b>common</b> <b>emitters,</b> using the heterojunction bipolar transistors in the 0. 13 µm SiGe BiCMOS process from IHP. Class AB operation ensures a good trade-off between efficiency and linearity. With load pull simulation, the output impedance was optimized for maximum output power. This was achieved without suffering from a bad output return loss and reflections, because conjugate matching was also attained at the output. Performance simulations yield a power gain of 21. 5 dB, a bandwidth of 9 GHz and a peak power added efficiency of 19 %. The output referred 1 dB compression point was simulated to 6. 5 dBm, for which the amplifier consumes 24 mW. A layout of the power amplifier circuit measuring 0. 15 square millimeters is proposed. Verification tests like electromagnetic simulation and corner and yield analysis remain, after which the presented block design can be implemented in the top level design of the transceiver chip...|$|R
30|$|Finally, after {{at least}} two generations {{essentially}} without change, the gamma camera is more than due for a total makeover. The gamma camera's main restrictions are related to its use of a physical, lead collimator to define the photon trajectories. This limits both sensitivity and spatial resolution. Alternatives, such as the Compton camera, exist but are {{still a long way}} from routine implementation. It is even likely that a Compton camera optimised for operating at energies around 0.5  MeV in single-photon mode could replace conventional coincidence detection in PET, as this mode of acquisition relies on the detection of both photons emitted in positron annihilation and represents a major restriction in sensitivity due to photon attenuation and scattering. Recall also that the branching ratio for the <b>common</b> positron <b>emitters</b> is close to 200 %, i.e. there are two photons released for every decay, also giving rise to potentially excellent sensitivity.|$|R
25|$|Gamma {{rays are}} also used for {{diagnostic}} purposes in nuclear medicine in imaging techniques. A number of different gamma-emitting radioisotopes are used. For example, in a PET scan a radiolabeled sugar called fludeoxyglucose emits positrons that are annihilated by electrons, producing pairs of gamma rays that highlight cancer as the cancer often has a higher metabolic rate than the surrounding tissues. The most <b>common</b> gamma <b>emitter</b> used in medical applications is the nuclear isomer technetium-99m which emits gamma rays in the same energy range as diagnostic X-rays. When this radionuclide tracer is administered to a patient, a gamma camera {{can be used to}} form an image of the radioisotope's distribution by detecting the gamma radiation emitted (see also SPECT). Depending on which molecule has been labeled with the tracer, such techniques can be employed to diagnose a wide range of conditions (for example, the spread of cancer to the bones via bone scan).|$|R

40|$|Drip {{irrigation}} is a {{means of}} distributing the exact amount of water a plant needs by dripping water directly onto the root zone. It can produce up to 90 % more crops than rain-fed irrigation, and reduce water consumption by 70 % compared to conventional flood irrigation. Drip irrigation may enable millions of poor farmers to rise out of poverty by growing more and higher value crops, while not contributing to overconsumption of water. Achieving this impact will require broadening the engineering knowledge required to design new, low-cost, low-power drip irrigation technology, particularly for poor, off-grid communities in developing countries. For more than 50 years, pressure compensating (PC) drip emitters-which can maintain a constant flow rate under variations in pressure, to ensure uniform water distribution on a field-have been designed and optimized empirically. This study presents a parametric model that describes the fluid and solid mechanics that govern the behavior of a <b>common</b> PC <b>emitter</b> architecture, which uses a flexible diaphragm to limit flow. The model was validated by testing nine prototypes with geometric variations, all of which matched predicted performance to within R 2 = 0. 85.

40|$|We report {{electrochemical}} studies, spectroscopy, and electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) of four monodisperse star-shaped truxene core−oligofluorene compounds (T 1 −T 4).

ECL spectra showed that all ECL emissions were at the same position as the fluorescence emission, except for T 1, the compound with the shortest fluorene arms that produced some longer wavelength emission in addition to that seen in the fluorescence spectrum. When tetra-n-butylammonium oxalate was used as a coreactant for T 1, the emission was much weaker than that in ion annihilation with the same long-wavelength emission observed, making it unlikely that this emission can be ascribed to excimer formation.

40|$|The {{electrospray}} ionization {{source is}} an interface between the separation techniques and mass spectrometry. With {{the help of}} electrospray the analyte ions of the liquid phase are transferred to the gas phase, which {{is necessary for the}} mass spectrometry detection method. The spraying of the analyte occurs in the high electric field applied between the emitter tip and mass spectrometer inlet. In the conventional electrospray the high electric field is produced by the application of the high potential to the analyte with a direct contact electrode. In an alternative method the high potential is applied to the analyte through a thin dielectric barrier. The displacement current in the dielectric material is utilized to transfer the charge to the analyte. The goal of current research is the further development by DB-ESI source, the detailed analysis of advantages of the ionization technique and possible issues comparing to the conventional electrospray ionization systems. The electrospray formation process is investigated with the experimental work and physical modeling.

In this case, the <b>common</b> <b>emitter</b> voltage and Q1 collector voltage are not suitable for outputs. Only Q2 collector should {{be used as an}} output since, when the input voltage exceeds the high threshold and Q1 saturates, its base-emitter junction is forward biased and transfers the input voltage variations directly to the emitters.

The OLEDs are investigated using the laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The comparison between the collected spectra for electrically aged and unaged OLEDs allows the identification of different reaction products, like fragments which are mainly related to the chemical dissociation of FIrpic molecules during the OLED operation. We present different reaction pathways of the blue emitter FIrpic. One proposed reaction indicates that the short lifetimes of the OLEDs {{may be related to the}} irreversible dissociation of the FIrpic molecule by the loss of carbon dioxide (CO 2) from the picolinate ligand. Additionally, the formation of chemical complexes between different fragments of the FIrpic molecules with their neighbour materials is visible. The cesium adducts of FIrpic formation indicate a possible contribution of the dopant to the OLED degradation process.

It can produce up to 90 % more crops than rain-fed irrigation, and reduce water consumption by 70 % compared to conventional flood irrigation. In the coming years, the demand for new, low-cost, low-power drip irrigation technology will continue to grow, particularly in developing countries. It will enable millions of poor farmers to rise out of poverty by growing more and higher value crops, while not contributing to overconsumption of water. The key inhibitor to drip adoption has been the high initial investment cost. A cost and pressure analysis revealed that a reduction in activation pressure of pressure compensating (PC) drip emitters - which can maintain a constant flow rate under variations in pressure, to ensure uniform water distribution on a field - can reduce the cost of off-grid drip systems by up to 50 %. These emitter have been designed and optimized empirically in the past. In this thesis, I present a parametric model that describes the fluid and solid mechanics that govern the behavior of a <b>common</b> PC <b>emitter</b> architecture, which uses a flexible diaphragm to limit flow. The model was validated by testing nine prototypes with geometric variations, all of which matched predicted performance to within R 2 = 0. 85. This parametric model was then coupled with a genetic algorithm to achieve a lower activation pressure of 0. 15 bar for not only the 8. 2 lph emitter, but also the 4, 6, 7 lph emitters.

40|$|Photon {{upconversion}} is {{a process}} by which lower energy photons are converted to higher energy photons, which {{can be achieved by}} the interaction of two triplet excited states. This process holds potential for wavelength shifting solid films in photovoltaic cells. Not all wavelengths emitted by the sun have sufficient energy to be utilized by such devices. Typical solar cells have a band gap of around 1 µm, however there is a significant amount of energy output by the sun that falls below this threshold. Upconversion could lead to more efficient use of energy by converting these lower energy wavelengths to wavelengths that could be directly absorbed by the solar panel. Upconversion has thus far been harnessed in solution, where diffusion is the limiting factor for the efficiency of the process. However, for technological applications {{it would be better to}} create thin solid films. In these films, molecules would have to be brought within the distance on which upconversion occurs, as the process would no longer be defined by diffusion. One way to achieve this would be to create liquid crystalline derivatives of upconversion emitter molecules. This would provide ordering in the system, which would enhance electronic coupling and bring molecules within the scale on which upconversion occurs. The work of this thesis has focused on the synthesis of these organised functional liquids: liquid crystals of <b>common</b> upconversion <b>emitter</b> molecules. 9, 10 -diphenylanthracene (DPA) and 9, 10 -bis(phenylethynyl) anthracene (BPEA) are popular emitter molecules, and derivatives of these molecules were synthesized. A variety of alkyl chains were attached with or without phenyl linkers. The alkyl chains would provide entropy to the system in order to induce the formation of liquid crystalline phases. The resulting phase behaviour of these derivatives was studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polarised optical microscopy (POM). Eight novel derivatives of DPA and BPEA were synthesized. New information was gained as to the requirements of inducing liquid crystallinity in these dye molecules. Direct addition of chains symmetrically to the central dye molecules did not result in the formation of liquid crystalline phases. Through extension of the central core by an extra phenyl ring a liquid crystalline behaviour was observed. A synthesized derivative of DPA exhibited extreme supercooling, which is one of a few derivatives of 9, 10 -diphenylanthracene to exhibit a liquid state at room temperature. A derivative of BPEA was synthesized that exhibited formation of a mesophase (liquid crystal phase). These two derivatives were investigated for potential use as a material for upconversion...|$|R
