40|$|Design of {{high-speed}} <b>cam</b> <b>profiles</b> for vibration reduction using command smoothing technique Zan Liang and Jie Huang Unwanted vibration in cam-follower systems causes increased forces, noise, wear, and operating costs. This paper proposes a novel method to design high-speed <b>cam</b> <b>profiles</b> for vibration reduction by using command smoothing technique. Using system natural frequency and damping ratio, the technique reduces vibrations by intelligently smoothing any basic profiles. Furthermore, {{an example is}} given to express the design process and to verify {{the effectiveness of the}} method. The displacement, velocity, acceleration, and jerk properties of the proposed profile are demonstrated to show the excellent smoothness, which benefits high-speed cam follower systems. The comparisons of vibration properties between the smoothed profile and 3 - 4 - 5 polynomial profile are explored and quantified. The smoothed profile will induce zero vibration at the design operating speed and produce a low level of vibration around it. Experimental results obtained from a rectilinear control plant validate the simulated dynamic behavior and the effectiveness of the profile created by using command smoothing...|$|R
50|$|One unique {{feature of}} the design was that the {{camshaft}} only had six lobes. One lobe operated both the intake and exhaust valve for each cylinder. This made engineering <b>cam</b> <b>profiles</b> a bit more difficult than conventional two lobe per cylinder (one per valve) designs, but allowed the valves to be better arranged for the cross-flow head. Valves were directly opposite their respective ports, and ports were short with wide radius turns.|$|R

The basic operation of the MIVEC system is altering the <b>cam</b> <b>profiles</b> and thus tailoring engine performance in response to driver input.|$|R
