5|$|The Japanese {{submarine}} {{offensive against}} Australia was broken off in July 1943 when the submarines were redeployed to counter Allied offensives {{elsewhere in the}} Pacific. The last two Japanese submarines to be dispatched against the Australian east coast, I-177 and I-180, were redirected to the central Solomon Islands shortly before they would have arrived off Australia in July. The Australian Naval authorities were concerned about a resumption of attacks, however, and maintained the <b>coastal</b> <b>convoy</b> system until late 1943 {{when it was clear}} that the threat had passed. Coastal convoys in waters south of Newcastle ceased on 7 December and convoys off the north-east coast and between Australia and New Guinea were abolished in February and March 1944 respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack on}} Sydney and Newcastle marked {{the start of}} a {{sustained}} Japanese submarine campaign against Australia. During 1942, Japanese submarines sank 17 ships in Australian waters, although none of these ships were sailing as part of a convoy. 16 ships were sunk in Australian waters during 1943, before the Japanese ended the campaign in July. Five of these ships were sunk while sailing in escorted convoys. The Australian naval authorities gradually dismantled the <b>coastal</b> <b>convoy</b> system between December 1943 and March 1944. By the end of the war, the RAAF and RAN had escorted over 1,100 convoys along the Australian coastline.|$|E
5|$|On 19 August 1942 a major landing {{took place}} at the French coastal town of Dieppe. The main force was {{provided}} by the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, supported by No. 3 and No. 4 Commandos. The mission of No. 3 Commando was to neutralize a German coastal battery near Berneval-le-Grand that {{was in a position to}} fire upon the landing at Dieppe. The landing craft carrying No. 3 Commando ran into a German <b>coastal</b> <b>convoy.</b> Only a handful of commandos, under the second in command Major Peter Young, landed and scaled the barbed wire laced cliffs. Eventually 18 Commandos reached the perimeter of the battery via Berneval and engaged the target with small arms fire. Although unable to destroy the guns, they prevented the Germans from firing effectively on the main assault by harassing their gun crews with sniper fire. In a subsidiary operation No. 4 Commando landed in force along with the French Troop No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando and 50 United States Army Rangers and destroyed the artillery battery at Varengeville. Most of No. 4 Commando safely returned to England. Captain Patrick Porteous of No. 4 Commando was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions during the raid.|$|E

25|$|Subsequently patrolling off {{the eastern}} coast of Honshū, Trepang went {{scoreless}} until July, when she spotted a <b>coastal</b> <b>convoy</b> of three ships. She torpedoed and sank the lead ship—Koun Maru Number Two—but the other vessels conducted evasive action and sped {{away from the}} scene at full speed.|$|E
25|$|She {{departed}} Fremantle {{once more}} 27 October 1944, {{bound for the}} South China Sea. She attacked a <b>coastal</b> <b>convoy</b> 14–15 November, sinking cargo ships Nichiei Maru and Yusan Maru before shallow water forced her to break off the fight. The attrition of Japanese shipping was beginning to tell, and Jack found no more opportunities before ending her patrol at Pearl Harbor 24 December 1944. From there she returned to San Francisco for a major overhaul.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to initial}} shortages, {{a pair of}} Lewis guns was {{sometimes}} substituted for the pom-pom, which would have left the ship very vulnerable to aircraft attack in its envisaged role of <b>coastal</b> <b>convoy</b> escort and patrol in the North Sea. The long-range endurance of the vessels, coupled with early war-time shortages of larger escort warships, saw Flowers assigned to trans-Atlantic convoy escort where Luftwaffe fighter-bombers were rarely encountered. Vessels assigned to the Mediterranean Sea usually had their anti-aircraft capability significantly upgraded.|$|E

25|$|With {{the gradual}} {{success of the}} Mediterranean convoys, the Germans began to {{concentrate}} on attacking shipping in Britain's coastal waters, as convoyed vessels dispersed to their individual ports. <b>Coastal</b> <b>convoy</b> routes were only added gradually due to the limited availability of escorts, {{but by the end}} of the war almost all sea traffic in the war zones was convoyed. The coastal convoys relied heavily on air support. After June 1918, almost all convoys were escorted in part by land-based airplanes and airships, as well as sea planes. The organisation of these convoys had also been delegated by the Admiralty to local commanders.|$|E
25|$|During {{the evening}} of 9 January, the task group passed through Bashi Channel of Luzon Strait and began a high speed run south. Two days later, carrier aviators struck targets between Cam Rahn Bay and Cape Varella, hitting many ground {{installations}} and virtually annihilating a <b>coastal</b> <b>convoy</b> north of Qui Nhơn. Nine Japanese ships were sunk in that attack, and another 13 were damaged. After retired to refuel, a task made more difficult owing to typhoon passing through area, the carriers shifted north to attack Hainan and Hong Kong. The following day, S1c Daniel A. Little was swept overboard by a wave and drowned. This was the first loss of life suffered by Biloxis crew.|$|E
25|$|After {{returning}} to service in February 1944 following her refit, Regina {{was assigned to}} the Mid-Ocean Escort Force escort group C-1 as a trans-Atlantic convoy escort. While escorting convoy SC 154, she was detached from escort duty to escort a Royal Navy tug that was towing the convoy rescue ship Dundas to Horta in the Azores. She left Horta 14 March 1944 to escort , which was under tow for the Clyde. At the end of March, Regina was assigned to Western Approaches Command for invasion duties associated with Operation Neptune, the naval component of the invasion of Normandy. After the invasion she was used as a <b>coastal</b> <b>convoy</b> escort in the English Channel.|$|E
5000|$|The British Royal Navy used hoys {{that were}} {{specially}} built to carry fresh water, gunpowder or ballast. Some {{were employed in}} such tasks as laying buoys or survey work, while others served to escort <b>coastal</b> <b>convoys.</b> Still others were in the Revenue service.|$|R

500|$|In 1805 Maxwell took {{command of}} the frigate [...] off Jamaica, {{participating}} in the Atlantic campaign of 1806 {{as part of the}} squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane that drove off a French attack on the Jamaica convoy near Tortola on 4 July 1806. In 1807, Maxwell was transferred to the Mediterranean in [...] He was initially part of a raiding squadron that attacked coastal batteries and positions along the Spanish coast in support of the Peninsular War. In April 1808, shortly before Spain became an ally of Britain, he successfully destroyed a Spanish convoy carrying military stores off Rota. Over the next two years Maxwell became an expert at raiding the French, Italian and Spanish coasts, destroying numerous Italian Martello Towers and small armed vessels. In May 1810 he was commended for a raid at Frejus, where he led a landing party that stormed and destroyed a coastal fort and seized a <b>coastal</b> <b>convoy.</b>|$|E
500|$|After the United States {{joined the}} Allies, Yorktown {{operated}} {{off the coast}} of Mexico until August 1917, when she paused briefly at San Diego. On 18 July 1917, Yorktown rescued the last surviving members of an abandoned guano mining settlement on Clipperton Island. [...] From a peak population of roughly 100 in 1915, only four women and seven children survived. [...] After her time off the Mexican coast, Yorktown then cruised off the west coasts of Central and South America into 1918. After a refit at Mare Island, Yorktown, sailed for the east coast on 28 April 1918, transiting the Panama Canal en route, and arrived at New York on 20 August. The gunboat escorted a <b>coastal</b> <b>convoy</b> to Halifax, soon there after before returning to New York. She performed local coastwise escort duties through the end of World War I. After a period of upkeep at the New York Navy Yard in December, she departed the east coast on 2 January 1919 on her last voyage to California.|$|E
50|$|Back in {{fighting}} trim 15 May 1944 she departed Charleston for Casco Bay, Maine. For {{the next year}} she operated primarily along the east coast, escorting new cruisers and aircraft carriers on shakedown and protecting <b>coastal</b> <b>convoys.</b> During this year she also escorted two convoys to the Mediterranean.|$|R
50|$|In early 1939 the {{squadron}} transitioned to the long-range fighter {{variant of the}} Bristol Blenheim. No. 604 Squadron was activated on 24 August 1939 to operate long-range fighters from RAF North Weald. The squadron spent the first several months of World War II flying defensive patrols in support of <b>coastal</b> <b>convoys.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another transatlantic convoy to Casablanca preceded shore {{bombardment}} {{exercises in}} Chesapeake Bay, after which she escorted <b>coastal</b> <b>convoys</b> until May, 1943.

2500|$|The USS PC-1264 {{was laid}} down at Consolidated Shipbuilding Company in Morris Heights, New York, on 7 October 1943 and {{launched}} on 28 November 1943. The PC-1264 was a United States Navy PC-461-class submarine chaser. This patrol class of submarine chaser {{was intended to}} intercept and destroy German U-boats stationed {{off the coast of}} the United States. Less expensive and faster to build than destroyers or even [...] destroyer escorts, and requiring smaller crews, they quickly filled an important need for <b>coastal</b> <b>convoy</b> protection and anti-submarine warfare.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1941, Wolsey was {{transferred}} to the Rosyth Escort Force based at Rosyth, Scotland, to escort coastal convoys in the North Sea and Northwestern Approaches. By October 1941, these duties increasingly included operations to intercept German motor torpedo boats – S-boats, known to the Allies as [...] "E-boats" [...] – before they could attack the convoys.

2500|$|The first convoys to sail {{after the}} German {{announcement}} were {{requested by the}} French Navy, desirous of defending British coal shipments. The Royal Navy's first coal convoy crossed the Channel on 10 February. These convoys were more weakly escorted, and contained a mixture of both steam-powered ships and sailing ships, as well as escorting aircraft based on the coast. In all, only 53 ships were lost in 39,352 sailings. When shippers from Norway (the [...] "neutral ally") requested convoys in 1916 {{after a year of}} very serious losses, but refused to accept the routes chosen by the Admiralty, they were declined. After the German proclamation, the Norwegians accepted British demands and informal convoying began in late January or February 1917, but regular convoys did not begin until 29 April. That same day, the first <b>coastal</b> <b>convoy</b> left Lerwick in the Shetland Islands, the destination of the Norwegian convoys, for the Humber. This was to become a regular route. The Norwegian and coastal convoys included airships based out of Scotland (and in the latter case also Yorkshire).|$|E

German S-boats escorting a German tanker torpedoed some of the LCP landing craft and disabled the escorting Steam Gun Boat 5. Subsequently, Motor Launch 346 [...] and Landing Craft Flak 1 combined to drive off the German boats but the group was dispersed, with some losses, and the enemy's coastal defences were alerted. The commandos from six craft who did land on Yellow I were beaten back and, unable to safely retreat or join the main force, had to surrender. Only 18 commandos got ashore on Yellow II beach. They reached {{the perimeter of the}} battery via Berneval, after it was attacked by Hurribombers, and engaged their target with small arms fire. Although unable to destroy the guns, their sniping for a time managed to distract the battery to such good effect that the gunners fired wildly and there was no known instance of this battery sinking any of the assault convoy ships off Dieppe. The commandos were eventually forced to withdraw in the face of superior enemy forces.|$|E
