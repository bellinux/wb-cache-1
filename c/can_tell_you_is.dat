Thorne-Begland also attempted to address concerns by pledging to [...] "neutrally apply the laws" [...] and avoid political advocacy.|$|E
500|$|The {{most recent}} {{meeting between the}} two clubs was in the FA Cup semi-finals; the tie was decided by a replay as the initial game {{finished}} goalless. The match was settled in extra time when Giggs {{ran the length of}} the pitch and evaded several Arsenal players to score the winning goal. In the close season, Anelka was involved in a protracted transfer saga and vowed to never play for Arsenal again. He cited the media in England as a reason for wanting to leave the club: [...] "The one thing I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> that I can't stand the English Press, who cause me enormous problems on a personal level," [...] but it was implied that his [...] "gold-digging brothers" [...] wanted Anelka to move abroad to make more money – they served as his agents.|$|E
500|$|.....of [...] that I have read, the {{negative}} ones often {{say something to}} the effect that the book is just like the game, so why read it? What those readers may not realize is that I was hired to novelize the game. That means taking the game and turning it into a book [...] or, put another way, I did what I was hired to do. ...there must be some folks who feel that I wrote the Chief out of character. That's news to me. All I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> that the Bungie folks, who care deeply about the character and the universe never raised that issue, and approved the book as written. However, there's no doubt that every author is different, and will approach characters differently. So if Nylund's rendition of the Chief is different from my own in subtle ways that would be understandable.|$|E

500|$|The Dhoom series {{began with}} the release of Dhoom in 2004. The film became a {{commercial}} box office hit and received generally positive reviews from audiences, but not so much from critics. As a result, producer Yash Chopra announced plans for a sequel, titled Dhoom 2: Back in Action. John Abraham, portrayer of Kabir Sharma, the villain of the predecessor, was eliminated from the sequel because Chopra did not want Dhoom 2 to repeat the stories featured in its predecessor. Instead, Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai were introduced into the franchise as the sequel's main villains. Aishwarya Rai's character was summarised as Catwoman, a female fictional comic book femme fatale or anti-hero [...] Rai stated, [...] "All I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> it would be nothing like anything you've seen me do before." [...] Producer Aditya Chopra told Rai to lose weight after she gained it for her role in 2004's Bride & Prejudice. Yash Chopra stated, [...] "But yes, the role does require Aishwarya to convey oodles of sensuality. She has asked {{for a couple of months}} to get into shape. We (at Yash Raj Films) are very clear about every character in every script and what's required of the actors. Before Dhoom, Esha Deol was specifically briefed about the look and the attitude she needed to cultivate. She readily agreed, and look at what Dhoom did to her career!" [...] Roshan also lost twelve pounds of weight at Aditya Chopra's request. With the exception of Abraham and Esha Deol, all of the other main actors in Dhoom were hired again for Dhoom 2.|$|E
