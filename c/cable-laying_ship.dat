Levi Woodbury departed Boston with a large party of about 150, including the Mayor, several ex-Mayors and other dignitaries. Thick fog however frustrated the expedition, and Levi Woodbury was obliged to return in the afternoon.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of the April 27, the Castilla was towed {{northeast}} of Grande Island to help control the western entrance to Subic Bay. The eastern entrance, which was between Grande and Chiquita Islands, had been blocked by the scuttling of the San Quentin and two other vessels. On Grande Island, the four six-inch (15.2cm) guns that had been shipped from Sangley Point were not yet installed. Meanwhile, a <b>cable-laying</b> <b>ship,</b> which was commandeered to lay mines ended up putting only four of the 15 available mines in place.|$|E

50|$|The post war {{recession}} hit {{the firm}} hard, and the shipyard {{was forced to}} close in 1930. Part of the site {{and some of the}} existing buildings later became incorporated into ROF Dalmuir, part was used by the General Post Office for their <b>cable-laying</b> <b>ships.</b>|$|R
50|$|To {{ensure that}} cable is laid and {{retrieved}} properly, specially designed equipment must be used. Different equipment {{is used on}} <b>cable-laying</b> <b>ships</b> depending on what their job requires. In order to retrieve damaged or mislaid cable, a grapple system is used to gather cable from the ocean floor. There are several types of grapples, each with certain advantages or disadvantages. These grapples {{are attached to the}} vessel via a grapple rope, originally a mix of steel and manila lines, but now made from synthetic materials. This ensures that the line is strong, yet can flex and strain {{under the weight of the}} grapple. The line is pulled up by reversing the Liner Cable Engine used to lay the cable.|$|R
5000|$|The {{museum was}} started by former {{employees}} of Cable and Wireless based at the company's Holborn headquarters in London. It is now located in the previously excavated tunnels near Porthcurno beach, Cornwall. The layout of the museum display was carried out after receiving {{a grant from the}} Heritage Lottery Fund.The museum has displays showing the history of submarine <b>cable-laying</b> <b>ships</b> and telegraphy, and a variety of samples of cable designs used throughout its long history. The museum has a varied collection of still-working equipment designed for telegraphy. It remained a training college for the communications industry until 1993. An Exeter University project known as [...] "Connecting Cornwall" [...] was funded to promote a new exhibition; [...] "The Nerve Centre of Empire". This was opened in the summer of 2010 by HRH the Princess Royal. The exhibition was developed as an educational experience for children and young people, employing original design from local artist, Hennie Haworth. There are now around 15 people working at the museum, welcoming visitors from around the world and managing with a constant flow of research enquiries from academics, family historians, local historians and the media. The most recent chapter in the museum's development involves the sensitive re-development of the Grade II listed buildings to accommodate greater exhibitions space, and improved visitor facilities including a cafe and greater accessibility. The project, 'Developing for the Future', has been supported by Heritage Lottery Fund, the Arts Council England, Coastal Communities Fund, SubOptic, the Charles Hayward Foundation,. Department for Culture, Media and Sport/Wolfson Museums and Galleries Improvement Fund, ShareGift, the Edith Murphy Foundation, the Garfield Weston Foundation, The Headley Trust, Cornwall Council and the Trusthouse Charitable Foundation. Further funding was provided by the Clore Duffield Foundation {{for the development of a}} new, flexible educational centre; the Clore Learning Space. As a result of this extensive capital project, the museum closed to the public in September 2013 and reopened in summer 2014.|$|R

50|$|The newest {{design of}} cable layers, though, is a {{combination}} of <b>cable-laying</b> and repair <b>ships.</b> An example is the USNS Zeus, the only U.S. naval cable layer/repair ship. The Zeus uses two diesel electric engines that produce 5000 horsepower each and can carry her up to 15 knots (about 17 miles per hour), and she can lay about 1000 miles of telecommunications cable to a depth of 9000 feet. The purpose of the Zeus was to be a cable ship that could do anything required of it, so the ship was built to be able to lay and retrieve cable from either the bow or the stern with ease. This design was {{similar to that of the}} first cable ship, the Great Eastern. The Zeus was built to be as maneuverable as possible so that it could fulfill both roles: as a cable layer or a cable repair ship.|$|R

5000|$|Brunel {{knew her}} affectionately as the [...] "Great Babe". He died in 1859 {{shortly after her}} ill-fated maiden voyage, during which she was damaged by an explosion. After repairs, she plied for several years as a {{passenger}} liner between Britain and North America before being converted to a <b>cable-laying</b> <b>ship</b> and laying the first lasting transatlantic telegraph cable in 1866. Finishing {{her life as a}} floating music hall and advertising hoarding (for the famous department store Lewiss) in Liverpool, she was broken up in 1889.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{completion}} in 2014, over 100 cabled seafloor and water column instruments will be operational.

50|$|The {{project was}} {{launched}} in 2006. Scientific surveys and studies of the sea floor began soon after. The first submarine cable as also onshore cables was laid in 2008 and the first voltage tests were conducted. In 2009, the converter stations in Latina and Fiume Santo entered into operation. Laying of the second submarine cable was scheduled {{for the end of}} 2010. The submarine cable-laying activity was being carried out by the Giulio Verne, the largest <b>cable-laying</b> <b>ship</b> in the world. The cable was inaugurated on 17 March 2011.|$|E

50|$|Abnaki {{spent the}} {{remainder}} of her Navy career operating along the west coast. Following post-deployment stand down and an extended availability, in May, she resumed towing and other operations along the California coast including surveillance operations, other fleet services, and training evolutions. At the beginning of 1978, Abnaki towed a <b>cable-laying</b> <b>ship</b> to Panama. During that voyage, she also made a call at Esmeraldas, Ecuador, before returning to San Diego on 12 February 1978. Normal operations along the west coast occupied her time from mid-February until April. The first week in April brought fleet exercises followed by a resumption of fleet services. During {{the first half of}} June, Abnaki participated in another series of fleet exercises and then resumed her usual west coast missions.|$|E
50|$|Modern cable ships differ {{greatly from}} their predecessors. There {{are two main}} types of cable ships: cable repair ships and cable-laying ships. Cable repair ships, like the Japanese Tsugaru Maru, tend to be smaller and more maneuverable; {{they are capable of}} laying cable, but their primary job is fixing or {{repairing}} broken sections of cable. A <b>cable-laying</b> <b>ship,</b> like the Long Lines, is designed to lay new cables. Such ships are bigger than repair ships and less maneuverable; their cable storage drums are also larger and are set in parallel so one drum can feed into another, allowing them to lay cable much faster. These ships are also generally equipped with a liner cable engine (LCE) that helps them lay cable quickly.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} in London, England. His father worked with Lord Kelvin and other pioneers of {{submarine}} telegraph cables, and Martin spent much time on the <b>cable-laying</b> <b>ship</b> SS Great Eastern. Educated as a theological student, Martin came to the United States in 1877. He was associated with Thomas A. Edison in his work in 1877-1879 and thereafter was engaged in editorial work. From 1883 to 1909 he served {{as editor of the}} Electrical World, after 1909 was executive secretary of the National Electric Light Association, and in 1900-1911 was a special agent of the United States Census Office. At various times he lectured at the Royal Institution of Engineers, London, the Paris Société Internationale des Electriciens, the University of Nebraska, and Columbia University. He was {{a founding member of the}} American Institute of Electrical Engineers, and served as president in 1887-1888.|$|E
