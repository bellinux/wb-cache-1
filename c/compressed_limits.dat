40|$|Acceptance {{sampling}} plays {{a crucial}} role in food quality assurance. However, safety inspection represents a substantial economic burden due to the testing costs and the number of quality characteristics involved. This thesis presents six pieces of work on the design of attribute and variables sampling inspection plans for food safety and quality. Several sampling plans are introduced with the aims of providing a better protection for the consumers and reducing the sample sizes. The effect of factors such as the spatial distribution of microorganisms and the analytical unit amount is discussed. The quality in accepted batches has also been studied, which is relevant for assessing the impact of the product in the public health system. Optimum design of sampling plans for bulk materials is considered and different scenarios in terms of mixing efficiency are evaluated. Single and two-stage sampling plans based on <b>compressed</b> <b>limits</b> are introduced. Other issues such as the effect of imperfect testing and the robustness of the plan have been also discussed. The use of the techniques is illustrated with practical examples. We considered numerous probability models for fitting aerobic plate counts and presence-absence data from milk powder samples. The suggested techniques have been found to provide a substantial sampling economy, reducing the sample size by a factor between 20 and 80 % (when compared to plans recommended by the International Commission on Microbiological Specification for Food (ICMSF) and the CODEX Alimentarius). Free software and apps have been published, allowing practitioners to design more stringent sampling plans.

Both types of complexes studied have idealized D 4 h point group symmetry with the d 2 systems representing the tetragonally <b>compressed</b> <b>limit</b> of a six-coordinate complex in the D 4 h point group and the d 8 systems representing the tetragonally elongated limit. The observed luminescence in both classes of complexes has been assigned as a metal-centered (d → d) 3 Eg → 1 A 1 g transition. The application of external pressure provides a means to induce minor changes in the molecular geometries of these model systems that reveal the delicate interplay between structural and electronic properties. Pressure-dependent spectroscopic data are analyzed quantitatively using theoretical models adapted from high-resolution low-temperature spectra where emitting state displacements along vibrational coordinates are determined from resolved vibronic structure. These combined experimental and theoretical techniques allow for a full characterization of the ground and emitting state potential energy surfaces and their explicit dependence on structural parameters. trans-Dioxo rhenium(V) and osmium(VI) complexes have formal metal-oxo double bonds and the electronic structures of these tetragonal systems are also influenced by the ancillary ligands bonded to the trans-[MO 2]n+ moiety. A series of trans-[ReO 2]+ complexes with substituted N,N,N',N'-ethylenediamine ligands were studied that show markedly varying luminescence energies and bandshape characteristics. Pressure-dependent luminescence spectra at room temperature show resolved structure in the high-frequency (~ 900 cm- 1) O = Re = O symmetric (a 1 g) stretching mode. Variable pressure causes the vibronic patterns to change and a detailed analysis is performed using potential energy surfaces from a coupled states model with the time-dependent theory of spectroscopy. Additional work was carried out on trans-dioxo osmium(VI) complexes with monodentate isothiocyanate ligands that show highly resolved vibronic structure at low temperature in both metal-ligand and ligand-centered a 1 g vibrational modes, allowing for a detailed analysis of the emitting state geometries. Temperature- and pressure-dependent spectroscopic studies of thiocyanate and selenocyanate complexes of platinum(II) and palladium(II) revealed significant variations of luminescence intensities and lifetimes.

The emerging grounded theory explains that facilitating CC among preservice teachers is a complex process that is mediated by pedagogical and institutional mechanisms. The institutional mechanisms of <b>compressed</b> time, <b>limited</b> opportunities for student agency, and lecture-based approaches to teaching were conveyed as having negative implications on developing a critical consciousness. However, there were “consciousness raising” learning experiences among the preservice teacher participants in this study when professors productively navigated these detrimental mechanisms by enacting legitimate forms of power and facilitating dialogical learning contexts.

40|$|Individual {{adjustment}} of frequency-to-electrode assignment in cochlear implants (CIs) may potentially improve speech perception outcomes. Twelve adult CI users were recruited for an experiment, in which frequency maps were adjusted using insertion angles estimated from post-operative x rays; results were analyzed for ten participants with good quality x rays. The allocations were a mapping to the Greenwood function, a <b>compressed</b> map <b>limited</b> {{to the area}} containing spiral ganglion (SG) cells, a reduced frequency range map (RFR), and participants' clinical maps. A trial period of at least six weeks was given for the clinical, Greenwood, and SG maps although participants could return to their clinical map if they wished. Performance with the Greenwood map was poor for both sentence and vowel perception and correlated with insertion angle; performance with the SG map was poorer than for the clinical map. The RFR map was significantly better than the clinical map for three participants, for sentence perception, but worse for three others.

30|$|A new {{technique}} is proposed {{to reduce the}} computational complexity of the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm for direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimate using a uniform linear array (ULA). The steering vector of the ULA is reconstructed as the Kronecker product of two other steering vectors, and a new cost function with spatial aliasing at hand is derived. Thanks to the estimation ambiguity of this spatial aliasing, mirror angles mathematically relating to the true DOAs are generated, based on which the full spectral search involved in the MUSIC algorithm is highly <b>compressed</b> into a <b>limited</b> angular sector accordingly. Further complexity analysis and performance studies are conducted by computer simulations, which demonstrate that the proposed estimator requires an extremely reduced computational burden while it shows a similar accuracy to the standard MUSIC.|$|R

This was when {{all four of the}} ratio buttons are pressed simultaneously."The way the 1176 sounds, and specifically, the way All-Button mode sounds, is {{partially}} due to its being a program dependent compressor. The attack and release are program dependent, as is the ratio.The 1176 will faithfully <b>compress</b> or <b>limit</b> at the selected ratio for transients, but the ratio will always increase a bit after the transient. To what degree is once again material dependent. This is true for any of the 1176’s ratio settings, and is part of the 1176’s sound.But in All-Button Mode, a few more things are happening; the ratio goes to somewhere between 12:1 and 20:1, and the bias points change all over the circuit. As a result, the attack and release times change. This change in attack and release times and the compression curve that results is the main contributor to the All-Button sound. This is what gives way to the trademark overdriven tone. The shape of the compression curve changes dramatically in All-Button. Where 4:1 is a gentle slope, All-Button is more like severe plateau! Furthermore, in All-Button mode there is a lag time on the attack of initial transients. This strange phenomenon might be described as a [...] "reverse look-ahead".|$|R
40|$|Abstract—During the {{recording}} of a haptic interaction session both position and force-feedback data have to be saved. This work proposes two novel methods for haptic data compression which allow to keep the reconstruction errors during playback below human perception thresholds. Supported by well-known results from psychophysics, the first proposed non-iterative method determines {{the least amount of}} samples necessary to reconstruct the force-feedback signal within the perception thresholds. The second proposed method compresses the position signal in open-loop fashion exploiting the fact that for the replay of haptic interaction sessions the position signal no longer has influence on the force-feedback. Thus, the only position information perceived by the user is the displayed visual information and therefore it can be <b>compressed</b> exploiting the <b>limits</b> of human visual perception. Our experimental results show better haptic signal compression performance when compared to the state-of-the-art for both methods while maintaining good haptic and visual subjective experiences...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} was to study the {{possibility}} of the occurrence of radical-type lipid peroxidation of the lipid constituents on biomembranes, in compressed monolayers, having lipoidal benzophenone photosensitizers incorporated. The triplets of the photosensitizer abstract allylic and doubly-allylic hydrogen atoms from anticonjugated moities of the lipid molecules. The results simultaneously confirmed the occurrence of H-abstraction (and so the initiation of the peroxidizing chain mechanism), and the absence of the formation of lipid peroxides. The reason lies in "cage effect": the highly restricted spacial area of <b>compressed</b> lipid monolayers <b>limits</b> the mobility of the created radicals (lipid radicals and ketyl radicals) and leads to their recombination, thus preventing the propagation step of the chain mechanism. With certain reservations it may be concluded that these results have a clear implication on real biomembranes: the structure of which is one of themain factors preventing the spread of the chain reaction, and the formation of lipid peroxides...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{shows how}} sparse, high-dimensional {{probability}} distributions could {{be represented by}} neurons with exponential compression.

The compressive measurements correspond to expected values of nonlinear functions of the probabilistically distributed variables. When these expected values are estimated by sampling, the quality of the <b>compressed</b> representation is <b>limited</b> only by the quality of sampling. Since the compression preserves the geometric structure of the space of sparse probability distributions, probabilistic computation can be performed in the compressed domain.

50|$|Wind Tengeki: The Divine Power of Wind is {{characterized}} by two things: its ability to cut and slice through vandels, {{and its ability to}} blow away monsters. Common attacks are creating blades of air focused to various degrees, which can slice through objects. Another common attack is to create tornadoes and hurricanes, which can blow opponents away. Wind Tengeki can also be focused through a weapon, either increasing its cutting ability or extending its reach. A high level attack, called Linear Gust, focuses Wind Tengeki to a great degree and the tengeki pushes through a monster's body, piercing it and exploding from within its body. Divine Wind can also be focused by skilled users around the body, which results in a shield of wind all around the user. A high level defense technique is to focus the Wind in the normal way of a shield, but is focused so that when a vandel comes within reach of the shield, the air will slice up the vandel. Wind is mainly used in mid to long range attacks, {{but it can also be}} used at close range. Wind Saigas are commonly shown to compress air for attacks, like Alside's Saiga Cyclone Gunner, which uses compressed balls of air for ammo. A close range example would be Slade's Saiga Silent Gaive.
