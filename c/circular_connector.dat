50|$|There are 19 shell sizes—from size-8 to size-40—with about 160 {{approved}} insert arrangements incorporating 1-to-85 contacts. The <b>circular</b> <b>connectors</b> {{are available}} {{with a choice of}} wall mount, box mount, cable connecting and jam-nut receptacles, as well as standard or self-locking plugs.|$|R
50|$|Even {{though this}} <b>circular</b> <b>connector</b> was largely standardized, {{there was no}} {{industry}} standard for pin assignments. Pin assignments to specific functions varied from manufacturer to manufacturer. For example, in amateur radio, Icom, Kenwood, and Yaesu radios have all used the 8-pin screw-on connector, yet microphones from one brand are incompatible {{with the other two}} brands, at least without the use of an adapter cable in between the microphone and the radio.|$|E

50|$|The term <b>Circular</b> <b>Connector</b> {{applies to}} any {{electrical}} connector possessing multipin interconnects with cylindrical contact housings and circular contact interface geometries. Circular connectors are selected {{for ease of}} engagement and disengagement, their ability to conveniently house different types of contacts, their wide range of allowable contact voltages and currents, their ease of environmental sealing and their rugged mechanical performance. In military, aerospace, and other high-reliability applications, the MIL-DTL-5015 and MIL-DTL-38999 {{are among the most}} commonly specified types. The primary disadvantage of the circular design is loss of panel space when used in arrays when compared to rectangular connectors.|$|E
5000|$|Connectors used by U.S. Department of Defense were {{originally}} {{developed in the}} 1930s for severe aeronautical and tactical service applications, and the Type [...] "AN" [...] (Army-Navy) series {{set the standard for}} modern military <b>circular</b> <b>connectors.</b> These connectors, and their evolutionary derivatives, are often called Military Standard, [...] "MIL-STD", or (informally) [...] "MIL-SPEC" [...] or sometimes [...] "MS" [...] connectors. They are now used in aerospace, industrial, marine, and even automotive commercial applications.|$|R
50|$|MIL-DTL-5015, a {{military}} specification, covers electrical <b>circular</b> <b>connectors</b> with solder or removable crimp contacts (both {{front and rear}} release). These connectors are for use in electronic, electrical power, and control circuits and are used in large numbers for defense, civil, and industrial applications due to their versatility, reliability, and ease of supply.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} {{does not}} specify the connector types {{or how they}} should be wired, other than shielding requirements, etc. In lab environments concentric twinax bayonet style connectors are commonly used. These connectors are available in standard (BNC size), miniature and sub-miniature sizes. In military aircraft implementations, MIL-DTL-5015 and MIL-DTL-38999 <b>circular</b> <b>connectors</b> are generally used.|$|R

During the late 1930s with World War II on the horizon, Cannon began volume production of multi-contact electrical connectors, which were used by virtually every aircraft builder in the United States. Cannon's AN Series (for [...] "Army/Navy") connector, developed for military aircraft applications, {{set the standard for}} modern military connector specifications.|$|E
50|$|Glenair, Inc. Manufactures {{a line of}} Type 5015 harsh {{environment}} <b>circular</b> <b>connector</b> providing outstanding corrosion resistance and rugged performance. These stainless steel, aluminum, and composite thermoplastic plugs and receptacles are ideally suited for severe environments such as geophysical exploration, mining and other settings where resistance to extreme temperatures, salt spray and caustic chemicals is a critical requirement. Fully compliant with the Mil-DTL-5015 specification, the connectors offer additional design features and materials advantages which make them exceptional values for many interconnect applications. The connectors are designed for rugged field use, and feature large profile knurlings for ease of handling, and anti-decoupling springs for maintenance-free performance. A complete range of pin sizes and insert arrangements are available.|$|E
50|$|A single bus {{consists}} of a wire pair with 70-85 Ω impedance at 1 MHz. Where a <b>circular</b> <b>connector</b> is used, its center pin {{is used for the}} high (positive) Manchester bi-phase signal. Transmitters and receivers couple to the bus via isolation transformers, and stub connections branch off using a pair of isolation resistors and, optionally, a coupling transformer. This reduces the impact of a short circuit and ensures that the bus does not conduct current through the aircraft. A Manchester code is used to present both clock and data on the same wire pair and to eliminate any DC component in the signal (which cannot pass the transformers). The bit rate is 1.0 megabit per second (1 bit per μs). The combined accuracy and long-term stability of the bit rate is only specified to be within ±0.1%; the short-term clock stability must be within ±0.01%. The peak-to-peak output voltage of a transmitter is 18-27 V.|$|E
50|$|First {{used in the}} 1970s by Japanese radio manufacturers, for {{microphone}} connectors on Citizens Band {{and amateur}} radio equipment, these screw-on <b>circular</b> <b>connectors</b> were available with 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 pins. They often were used for other purposes as well, such as 1970s Kenwood mobile transceivers, Eastern Asian built soldering stations in 1990s.|$|R
50|$|MIL-DTL-5015 <b>circular</b> <b>connectors</b> {{are used}} {{primarily}} for their ease of engagement and disengagement, ability to house {{different types of}} contacts, {{a wide range of}} allowable contact voltages and currents, and their rugged mechanical performance under a variety of environmental conditions.

5000|$|With Modbus, BacNet and Profibus, A/B {{labeling}} refers A as {{the negative}} green wire and B as the positive red wire, {{in the definition}} of the D-sub connector and M12 <b>circular</b> <b>connector,</b> {{as can be seen in}} Profibus guides. As long as standard excludes logic function of the generator or receiver, it would make sense A (green, negative) is higher than B (red, positive). However this contradicts the facts that an idle mark state is a logical one and the termination polarization puts B at a higher voltage in Profibus guidelines. That so-called 'Pesky Polarity' problem [...] raised confusion which made authors think A is inverting within the TIA-485-A standard itself [...] and advise to swap what is A and B in drivers and line labeling as can be read in a section of an application bulletin: [...] "Design Consideration #3: Sometimes Bus Node A Isn’t Really Bus Node A". It is now a common design decision to make this inversion which involves the following polarity chain: UART/MCU idle => TTL/CMOS = +5V => Line B voltage > Line A voltage, implying A, the green wire, is indeed connected to the driver inverting signal, as seen in a whitepaper.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{introduces}} two {{statistics on}} set partitions, namely connector and <b>circular</b> <b>connector.</b> If B 1 /…/Bk is a partition of { 1,…,n} with k> 1 blocks, then a connector is an ordered pair (c,c+ 1) satisfying c∈Bi,c+ 1 ∈Bi+ 1,i= 1,…,n− 1. A <b>circular</b> <b>connector</b> is a connector when the blocks of a partition are arranged on a circle. We {{concentrate on the}} enumeration of partitions according to the two statistics, and certain variations thereof. Our results include several nice generating functions and explicit formulas. We also establish connections between connected partitions and words over a finite alphabet, and random walks on a square lattice...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the context}} of {{consumer}} electronics, the term [...] "DIN connector" [...] commonly refers {{to a member of}} a family of <b>circular</b> <b>connectors</b> that were initially standardized by DIN for analog audio signals. Some of these connectors have also been used in analog video applications, for power connections and for digital interfaces such as MIDI or the IBM AT computer keyboard (later PS/2 connectors for keyboard and mouse are Mini-DIN connectors). The original DIN standards for these connectors are no longer in print and have been replaced with the equivalent international standard IEC 60130-9.|$|R
5000|$|MIL-DTL-5015 (formerly MIL-C-5015) {{describes}} electrical <b>circular</b> <b>connectors</b> with solder or removable crimp contacts (both {{front and}} rear release). These connectors are for use in electronic, electrical power, and control circuits and are used in large numbers for defense, civil, and industrial applications due to their versatility, reliability, and ease of supply. These connectors are rated for operation within a temperature range of -55 °C (-67 °F) to either 125 °C (257 °F), 175 °C (347 °F), or 200 °C (392 °F) depending upon the class of the connector. The insert arrangements are provided in MIL-STD-1651.|$|R
5000|$|While Mini-DIN {{connectors}} {{cannot be}} plugged in the [...] "wrong way", {{it is possible}} to have trouble finding the right way without looking inside the <b>circular</b> <b>connector's</b> shroud. Apple attempted to help by using U-shaped soft plastic grips around the connectors to key both plugs and sockets so the flat side has a specific relation to the shell keyway, but this feature was ignored by some 3rd-party manufacturers. Additionally, there are four ways to orient the receiving socket on a device such as a keyboard; various Apple keyboards use at least three of these possible orientations.|$|R

50|$|Pin and Sleeve <b>circular</b> <b>connectors</b> are not {{compatible}} with the newer IEC 60309 type. Current ratings are 30, 60, 100, 200, and 400 A. All are rated for voltages up to 250 V DC or 600 V AC. Contact arrangements are from 2 to 4 pins. There are two styles depending on {{the treatment of the}} ground. Style 1 grounds only on the shell. Style 2 uses one of the contacts as well as the shell, internally connected together. They are not strongly typed for specific circuits and voltages as the IEC 309 are. One insert rotation option is available to prevent mating of similar connectors with different voltages.|$|R
50|$|Some {{high-end}} {{monitors and}} video cards featured 5 separate BNC connectors for RGBHV signal, allowing highest quality connection using five 75 ohm coaxial cables. Within a 15-pin connector, the red, green, and blue signals (pins 1, 2, 3) cannot be shielded from each other, so crosstalk is possible within the 15-pin interconnect. BNC prevents crosstalk by maintaining full coaxial shielding through the <b>circular</b> <b>connectors,</b> but the connectors are {{very large and}} bulky. The requirement to press and turn the plug shell to disconnect requires access space around each connector to allow grasping of each BNC plug shell. Supplementary signals such as DDC are typically not supported with BNC.|$|R
