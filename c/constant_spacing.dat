50|$|The equirectangular {{projection}} (also {{called the}} equidistant cylindrical projection, geographic projection, or la carte parallélogrammatique projection, and {{which includes the}} special case of the plate carrée projection or geographic projection) is a simple map projection attributed to Marinus of Tyre, who Ptolemy claims invented the projection about AD 100. The projection maps meridians to vertical straight lines of <b>constant</b> <b>spacing</b> (for meridional intervals of <b>constant</b> <b>spacing),</b> and circles of latitude to horizontal straight lines of <b>constant</b> <b>spacing</b> (for constant intervals of parallels). The projection is neither equal area nor conformal. Because of the distortions introduced by this projection, it has little use in navigation or cadastral mapping and finds its main use in thematic mapping. In particular, the plate carrée has become a standard for global raster datasets, such as Celestia and NASA World Wind, because of the particularly simple relationship between the position of an image pixel on the map and its corresponding geographic location on Earth.|$|E

40|$|A new string-matching {{algorithm}} {{working in}} <b>constant</b> <b>space</b> and linear time is presented. It {{is based on}} a powerful idea of sampling, originally introduced in parallel computations. The algorithm uses a sample S which consists of two positions inside the pattern P. First the positions of the sample S are tested against the corresponding positions of the text T, then a version of Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm is applied. This gives the simplest known string-matching algorithm which works in <b>constant</b> <b>space</b> and linear time and which does not use any linear order of the alphabet. A refined version of the algorithm gives the fastest (in the sense of number of comparisons) known algorithm for string-matching in <b>constant</b> <b>space.</b> It makes (1 + ") n + O(n m) symbol comparisons. This improves substantially the result of [3], where a (3 2 + ") n comparisons <b>constant</b> <b>space</b> algorithm was designed.

The building is 14 meters (46 ft) tall, from the event floor to the pinnacle of the roof. The ring beam is supported by forty circular columns and four stiff pylons, all visible in the arenas facade. The pylons consist of radially oriented concrete walls, with a length of 3.5 meters (11.5 ft), which stores ventilation equipment. The video board, lights, and sound system is suspended in a radially oriented cable system anchored in the four pylons. It was not consider stable enough for colour telecasting to attach these components directly to the roof. The cable system also serves as tension rods for the ring beam.|$|E
5000|$|Twin lead is used {{to connect}} FM radios and {{television}} receivers with their antennas, {{although it has been}} largely replaced in the latter application by coaxial cable, and as a feedline for low power transmitters such as amateur radio transmitters. It consists of two wire conductors running parallel to each other with a precisely <b>constant</b> <b>spacing,</b> molded in polyethylene insulating material in a flat ribbon-like cable. The distance between the two wires is small relative to the wavelength of the RF signal carried on the wire. Furthermore, the RF current in one wire is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the RF current on the other wire (it is inverted). Thus, if both wires radiate energy equally, the radiated energies will cancel each other out and there will be near zero radiation at any distance from the wire. Twin lead is also immune to external noise or RF energies. Any unwanted external noise or unwanted RF energy induced on the wire from external energy sources will be induced in both wires {{at the same time and}} equally in magnitude and direction. At the end of the transmission line the inverted signal wire is restored to normal (non-inverted now) and added back to the original non-inverted signal wire by the receiving circuitry. Any noise will now be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction and cancel itself out.|$|E

In previous research work, we pro-posed new algorithms to mitigate communication delays effects on platoon string stability using anticipatory information. In this paper we consider <b>constant</b> <b>spacing</b> between platoons ’ leaders as a fundamental condition to attain high traffic capacity. New algorithms to maintain interplatoon leaders ’ <b>constant</b> <b>spacing</b> are proposed, as well as novel algorithms allowing vehicles to enter the main track cooperatively. Furthermore, {{a new set of}} algorithms to improve safety is also presented. A novel agent-based architecture was developed, in which each vehicle consists of two distinct modules, a leader and a follower. Based on MATLAB/Simulink simulations of several scenarios, the new algorithms are assessed and the simulation results presented, confirming that the proposed algorithms ensure high traffic capacity and vehicle density and avoid traffic congestion. These features were validated through simulations performed on the Simulation for Urban Mobility sim-ulation platform, using a new car-following model implementation [10]. The results proved that the proposed algorithms enable a clear benefit of a platooning system, when compared with bus- and light-rail-based transit systems.

40|$|Abstract — Intra-platoon {{positioning}} {{management strategies}} {{to deal with}} safe and efficient advanced traffic management system operation are proposed in this paper. New algorithms to ensure high traffic capacity are proposed, and Matlab/Simulink-based simulation results are reported. Recently, we proposed new algorithms to mitigate communication delays using anti-cipatory information, both from the platoon’s leader and the followers, with {{significant impact on the}} improvement of platoon string stability [5]. In this paper, we argue that maintaining a <b>constant</b> <b>spacing</b> between platoons ’ leaders has a positive impact on the traffic capacity of the whole system. As such, when the leader and eventually other vehicles immediately behind it leave the platoon, the new leader must accelerate to reach the position of the previous leader, to ensure inter-leader <b>constant</b> <b>spacing</b> and, consequently, enough spacing to be eventually occupied by new followers. We developed a novel architecture where each vehicle consists of two distinct modules: a leader and a follower. Based on Matlab/Simulink-based simulation, the new algorithms are assessed, and simulation results presented. The obtained simu-lation results confirm that the proposed algorithms adapt the acceleration pattern, ensuring similar timings for all possible cases of the previous position of new leaders in the platoon, when performing their repositioning maneuvers.
