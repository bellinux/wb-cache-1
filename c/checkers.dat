5|$|Bowman {{made the}} Hurricanes' roster out of {{training}} camp in 2010–11, but was returned to the AHL within a month. With the Hurricanes having changed their minor league affiliate, he joined a new team, the Charlotte <b>Checkers.</b> After recording 30 points (12 goals and 18 assists) over 51 games with the <b>Checkers</b> (10th in team scoring), he was recalled on March 10, 2011. Spending {{the remainder of the}} season with the Hurricanes, he finished 2010–11 with one assist over 23 games, while averaging 10 minutes of ice time. Carolina failed to qualify for the playoffs, coming within three points of the eighth and final seed in the Eastern Conference. With his NHL season over, the Hurricanes returned him to the AHL, where the <b>Checkers</b> had qualified for the 2011 Calder Cup Playoffs. Bowman contributed 8 points (2 goals and 6 assists) over 15 games as the <b>Checkers</b> were eliminated in the Conference Finals by the Binghamton Senators.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, {{using the}} Ferranti Mark 1 machine of the University of Manchester, Christopher Strachey wrote a <b>checkers</b> program and Dietrich Prinz wrote one for chess. Arthur Samuel's <b>checkers</b> program, {{developed}} in the middle 50s and early 60s, eventually achieved sufficient skill to challenge a respectable amateur. Game AI {{would continue to be}} used as a measure of progress in AI throughout its history.|$|E
5|$|Bowman was not re-signed by the Canadiens and on October 12, 2015, {{without any}} NHL interest, Bowman signed a one-year {{deal with the}} Colorado Eagles of the ECHL. After {{registering}} 3 assists in 3 games with the Eagles to start the 2015–16 season, Bowman was loaned to former club, the Charlotte <b>Checkers</b> of the AHL on October 22, 2015. Bowman played a further 16 games with the <b>Checkers</b> {{before he left the}} club to pursue a European career in agreeing to a contract {{for the remainder of the}} season in Germany with Düsseldorfer EG of the DEL on December 21, 2015.|$|E
5|$|While endgame tablebases {{for other}} board games like <b>checkers,</b> chess {{variants}} or Nine Men's Morris exist, when a game is not specified, {{it is assumed}} to be chess.|$|E
5|$|Defunct {{companies}} that were founded or based in Mobile included Alabama Drydock and Shipbuilding Company, Delchamps, and Gayfers. Current {{companies that}} were formerly based in the city include <b>Checkers,</b> Minolta-QMS, Morrison's, and the Waterman Steamship Corporation. In addition to those discussed below, AlwaysHD, Foosackly's, Integrity Media, and Volkert, Inc. are currently headquartered out of Mobile.|$|E
5|$|In any event, after Wright and Till {{left the}} store, Bryant {{went outside to}} {{retrieve}} a pistol from underneath the seat of a car. The teenagers saw her do this and left immediately. It was acknowledged that Till whistled while Bryant was going to her car. However, it is disputed whether Till whistled toward Bryant or toward a <b>checkers</b> game that was occurring just across the street.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Checkers</b> {{speech or}} Fund speech was an address made on September 23, 1952, by the Republican {{candidate}} {{for vice president}} of the United States, California Senator Richard Nixon. Nixon had been accused of improprieties relating to a fund established by his backers to reimburse him for his political expenses. With his place on the Republican ticket in doubt, he flew to Los Angeles and delivered a half-hour television address in which he defended himself, attacked his opponents, and urged the audience to contact the Republican National Committee (RNC) to tell it whether he should remain on the ticket. During the speech, he stated that regardless of what anyone said, he intended to keep one gift: a black-and-white dog who had been named <b>Checkers</b> by the Nixon children, thus giving the address its popular name.|$|E
5|$|With The Mansion Of Happiness {{published}} from 1800 in England to 1926 in The United States, it is {{the longest}} continuously published board game with a known designer, George Fox. That totals 126 years of continuous publication. Obviously Chess, Draughts (<b>Checkers),</b> Go, and many other board games have been continuously published for a longer time, {{but no one knows}} the designer of these games.|$|E
5|$|American Cocker Spaniels {{have had}} several {{links to the}} United States Presidency. In 1952, an American Cocker Spaniel became a {{household}} name when United States Senator Richard Nixon made his <b>Checkers</b> speech on 23 September. A parti-colored American Cocker Spaniel named Dot {{was one of several}} dogs owned by Rutherford B. Hayes; and a buff colored dog named Feller caused a scandal for Harry S. Truman when the dog was received as an unwanted gift with the President subsequently giving it away to a White House physician. More recently, a Cocker named Zeke lived with Bill Clinton while he was Arkansas Governor.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1967, Nixon {{told his}} family he planned to run for {{president}} a second time. Although Pat Nixon did not always enjoy public life (for example, she had been embarrassed by the need to reveal how little the family owned in the <b>Checkers</b> speech), she was supportive of her husband's ambitions. Nixon believed that with the Democrats torn over the issue of the Vietnam War, a Republican had a good chance of winning, although he expected the election to be as close as in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Bowman {{spent four}} years at the major junior level with the Spokane Chiefs of the Western Hockey League (WHL). He won a Memorial Cup with the Chiefs in 2008 and was named a WHL West Second Team All-Star in 2009. He turned {{professional}} in 2009–10 and has spent {{the majority of his}} tenure with the Hurricanes in the team's farm system with the Albany River Rats and Charlotte <b>Checkers</b> of the American Hockey League (AHL). Internationally, Bowman has competed for the United States at the 2009 IIHF World U20 Championships.|$|E
5|$|Head chef Stephane Borie {{trained with}} Michel Roux {{at the three}} Michelin star {{restaurant}} The Waterside Inn in Bray, Berkshire for seven years, where he met pastry chef Sarah Francis. Borie and Francis went on to run the Herbert Arms near Montgomery in 2008 with Sarah's sister Kathryn running the front of house service. The trio took over The <b>Checkers</b> in March 2011, refurbishing the former pub as a restaurant. They praised the customer base following them from the Herbert Arms to the new venture.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, Richard Bellman {{proposed}} {{the creation of}} a database to solve chess and <b>checkers</b> endgames using retrograde analysis. Instead of analyzing forward from the position currently on the board, the database would analyze backward from positions where one player was checkmated or stalemated. Thus, a chess computer would no longer need to analyze endgame positions during the game because they were solved beforehand. It would no longer make mistakes because the tablebase always played the best possible move.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the other}} boys ran {{across the street to}} tell Curtis Jones what {{happened}} in the store. When the older man with whom Jones was playing <b>checkers</b> heard the story, he urged the boys to leave quickly, fearing violence. Bryant told others of the events at the store, and the story spread quickly. Jones and Till declined to tell his great-uncle Mose Wright, fearing they would get in trouble. Till said he wanted to return home to Chicago. Carolyn's husband Roy Bryant was on an extended trip hauling shrimp to Texas and did not return home until August 27.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Checkers,</b> is a {{restaurant}} with rooms in Montgomery, Powys, Wales. Historically, the building {{was used as a}} coaching inn dating from the 17th century. Until the 2000s, it was used as a pub/hotel. It was converted into a French restaurant in 2012 and under chef Stephane Borie, it was awarded a Michelin star later that year. There are two main rooms in the restaurant, and three hotel rooms. It has received a mixed reception from critics, who have praised particular dishes but criticised the atmosphere. It serves both modern and classic French dishes, and in 2016, switched to only using set menus.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{dates from}} the 17th century, and was originally used as a coaching inn. References to the <b>Checkers</b> Inn in Montgomery within the British Newspaper Archives appear {{as far back as}} 1855, when Rebecca Davies' annual ball was due to take place in the large room there. In 1870, the inn was run by Charles Williams. During the early 2000s, the building was operated as a hotel and pub,. with Eric Whittingham as landlord.|$|E
5|$|There were {{charges of}} vote fraud in Texas and Illinois, both states won by Kennedy; Nixon refused to {{consider}} contesting the election, feeling a lengthy controversy would diminish the United States {{in the eyes}} of the world, and the uncertainty would hurt U.S. interests. At the end of his term of office as vice president in January 1961, Nixon and his family returned to California, where he practiced law and wrote a bestselling book, Six Crises, which included coverage of the Hiss case, Eisenhower's heart attack, and the Fund Crisis, which had been resolved by the <b>Checkers</b> speech.|$|E
5|$|By this time, {{the first}} wave of what would {{eventually}} be more than four million letters, telegrams, postcards, and phone calls had flooded into RNC headquarters and other political offices. While a later study found that only about 7 percent of these communications addressed any substantive issue, they still ran 75 to one in favor of Nixon. Nixon skeptics joined in; both Stassen and Dewey sent congratulatory telegrams. Many letters included contributions {{to help pay for the}} cost of the broadcast; the RNC eventually recouped four-fifths of the $75,000 cost. Newspaper switchboards were jammed with calls from people seeking the RNC's address, while Western Union was caught off guard by Nixon's request that listeners wire the RNC, and had no extra help on hand. <b>Checkers</b> herself received enough dog food to last a year, and hundreds of collars, leashes, and toys.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{retained}} Chotiner as {{a consultant}} to his first congressional campaign in 1946. In an era when the perceived threat of communism was a major domestic issue, Chotiner advised the future president to link his liberal opponent, Representative Jerry Voorhis, to a political organization which was believed to be communist-dominated. Nixon was elected, and hired Chotiner to run his 1950 Senate campaign against Representative Helen Gahagan Douglas. Chotiner used a similar strategy in that campaign, stressing Douglas' liberal voting record and printing the accusations on pink paper to hint at communist sympathy. Congressman Nixon easily defeated Douglas, and Chotiner next managed Nixon's 1952 vice presidential campaign and counseled Nixon through allegations of antisemitism and revelations that there were privately run funds to pay Nixon's political expenses—revelations that the candidate decisively overcame with his televised <b>Checkers</b> speech.|$|E
5|$|Till {{arrived in}} Money, Mississippi, on August 21, 1955. On August 24, he and cousin Curtis Jones skipped church where his great-uncle Mose Wright was preaching and joined some local boys {{as they went}} to Bryant's Grocery and Meat Market to buy candy. The {{teenagers}} were children of sharecroppers and had been picking cotton all day. The market mostly served the local sharecropper population and was owned by a white couple, 24-year-old Roy Bryant and his 21-year-old wife Carolyn. Carolyn {{was alone in the}} store that day; her sister-in-law was {{in the rear of the}} store watching children. Jones left Till with the other boys while Jones played <b>checkers</b> across the street.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 2013 NHL season, Malhotra {{became an}} {{unrestricted}} free agent. After being unsigned by an NHL team {{at the start of the}} 2013–14 season and looking to continue his playing career Malhotra signed a 25-game professional try out (PTO) contract with the AHL's Charlotte <b>Checkers.</b> The Carolina Hurricanes signed Malhotra to a one-year two way contract on October 31 and he made his Carolina debut against the New York Rangers on November 2. On November 6, Manny scored his first NHL goal in 19 months, scoring a game winner in overtime against the Flyers. As a measure of the amount of respect he has earned in the locker room in just a few weeks, Manny was selected to be an interim Assistant Captain while Tim Gleason was out with an injury. After Gleason was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs, Malhotra was officially declared Alternate Captain for the remainder of the season.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1947 {{invention}} of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game {{as well as the}} first to use an electronic display, the first true video games were created in the early 1950s. Initially created as technology demonstrations, such as the Bertie the Brain and Nimrod computers in 1950 and 1951, video games also became the purview of academic research. A series of games, generally simulating real-world board games, were created at various research institutions to explore programming, human–computer interaction, and computer algorithms. These include OXO and Christopher Strachey's draughts program in 1952, the first software-based games to incorporate a CRT display, and several chess and <b>checkers</b> programs. Possibly the first video game created simply for entertainment was 1958's Tennis for Two, featuring moving graphics on an oscilloscope. As computing technology improved over time, computers became smaller and faster, and the ability to work on them was opened up to university employees and undergraduate students {{by the end of the}} 1950s. These new programmers began to create games for non-academic purposes, leading up to the 1962 release of Spacewar! as one of the earliest known digital computer games to be available outside a single research institute.|$|E
5|$|Josefson {{participated in}} the {{pre-season}} camp with the Devils in September, but was assigned to their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Albany Devils after the camp. Josefson was called up to the Devils on 14 October 2010, and made his NHL debut the next day, in a 3–2 victory against Colorado Avalanche at the Prudential Center. Josefson was slashed on {{his left hand and}} later fell on the same hand during the game against San Jose Sharks on 27 October, this caused a ligament in his thumb to tear, and forced him to undergo surgery. At last, Josefson returned from his injury on 7 January 2011, when the Albany Devils played against the Charlotte <b>Checkers.</b> Josefson scored his first NHL goal against Al Montoya of the New York Islanders on 12 March 2011. The Devils failed to reach the playoffs and Josefson ended up with three goals and ten points in 28 regular season games.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{limitations}} of computer hardware aside, in principle {{it is possible}} to solve any game under the condition that the complete state is known and there is no random chance. Strong solutions, i.e. algorithms that can produce perfect play from any position, are known for some simple games such as Tic Tac Toe/Noughts and crosses (draw with perfect play) and Connect Four (first player wins). Weak solutions exist for somewhat more complex games, such as <b>checkers</b> (with perfect play on both sides the game is known to be a draw, but it is not known for every position created by less-than-perfect play what the perfect next move would be). Other games, such as chess (from the starting position) and Go, have not been solved because their game complexity is too vast for computers to evaluate all possible positions. To reduce the game complexity, researchers have modified these complex games by reducing the size of the board, or the number of pieces, or both.|$|E
5|$|To {{transform}} a probabilistically checkable proof system {{of this type}} into a clique problem, one forms a graph with a vertex for each possible accepting run of the proof checker. That is, a vertex is defined {{by one of the}} possible random choices of sets of positions to examine, and by bit values for those positions that would cause the checker to accept the proof. Two vertices are adjacent, in this graph, if the corresponding two accepting runs see the same bit values at every position they both examine. Each (valid or invalid) proof string corresponds to a clique, the set of accepting runs that see that proof string, and all maximal cliques arise in this way. One of these cliques is large if and only if it corresponds to a proof string that many proof <b>checkers</b> accept. If the original satisfiability instance is satisfiable, it will have a valid proof string, one that is accepted by all runs of the checker, and this string will correspond to a large clique in the graph. However, if the original instance is not satisfiable, then all proof strings are invalid, each proof string has {{only a small number of}} checker runs that mistakenly accept it, and all cliques are small. Therefore, if one could distinguish in polynomial time between graphs that have large cliques and graphs in which all cliques are small, or if one could accurately approximate the clique problem, then applying this approximation to the graphs generated from satisfiability instances would allow satisfiable instances to be distinguished from unsatisfiable instances. However, this is not possible unless P=NP.|$|E

25|$|Suicide <b>checkers</b> (also called Anti-checkers, Giveaway <b>checkers,</b> or Losing draughts): The misère {{version of}} <b>checkers.</b> The winner {{is the first}} player to have no legal move: that is, all of whose pieces are lost or blocked.|$|E
25|$|The {{most popular}} forms are English draughts, also called American <b>checkers,</b> {{played on a}}n 8×8 checkerboard; Russian draughts, also played on an 8×8; and {{international}} draughts, played on a 10×10 board. There are many other variants played on 8×8 boards. Canadian <b>checkers</b> and Singaporean/Malaysian <b>checkers</b> (also locally known as dum) are played on a 12×12 board.|$|E
25|$|White moves h4-f2. The checker moves two spaces {{because there}} are two <b>checkers</b> in the diagonal: h4 and e1. White threatens the {{mobility}} of Black's <b>checkers</b> in the bottom row.|$|E
25|$|Bräde or svenskt brädspel ("Swedish tables") is {{a variant}} played in Sweden. Players starts with all 15 of their <b>checkers</b> on {{opposite}} {{corners of the}} board, and play around counter-clockwise. Besides bearing off, {{there are several other}} ways to win, such as arranging all of one's <b>checkers</b> in certain pre-determined patterns, or by hitting so many <b>checkers</b> that one's opponent can not bring them in again. Additional points are awarded for a victory while one's opponent has <b>checkers</b> on the bar. Brädspel is played without the doubling cube. Interest in brädspel experienced a resurgence following the recovery of a 17th-century board from the wreck of the Vasa.|$|E
25|$|A checker may {{jump over}} {{friendly}} <b>checkers.</b> Thus Black may continue with e8-b5, jumping his own checker. He moves three spaces {{because there are}} three <b>checkers</b> in the diagonal (a4-e8) {{in which he is}} moving.|$|E
25|$|As a result, superko {{variants}} (moves that {{repeat a}} previous board position are not allowed) of generalized chess and <b>checkers</b> are EXPSPACE-complete, since generalized chess and <b>checkers</b> are EXPTIME-complete. However, this result {{does not apply}} to Go.|$|E
25|$|If {{one player}} has not borne off any <b>checkers</b> {{by the time}} the {{opponent}} has borne off all fifteen, then the player has lost a gammon, which counts for double a normal loss. If the losing player has not borne off any <b>checkers</b> and still has <b>checkers</b> on the bar or in the opponent's home board, then the player has lost a backgammon, which counts for three times a normal loss.|$|E
25|$|<b>Checkers</b> move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, the Albany River Rats, the American Hockey League {{affiliate}} of the Hurricanes, relocated to Charlotte {{and became the}} Charlotte <b>Checkers,</b> assuming the name from the former ECHL team that had played in the city since 1995. The Charlotte <b>Checkers</b> play their home games at Bojangles' Coliseum in uptown Charlotte.|$|E
25|$|A checker may not {{jump over}} an enemy checker. Thus in the diagram below, White can't play a6-d6, {{even though there}} are three <b>checkers</b> in row 6. White might instead play a6-c4, moving two spaces because there are two <b>checkers</b> in the {{diagonal}} (a6-f1) in which White is moving.|$|E
