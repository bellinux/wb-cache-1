5000|$|Mr. President,I {{have the}} honour {{to take the}} floor today {{on behalf of a}} diverse group of 42 {{developing}} countries from Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia and the Pacific, who are united by a common cause - to achieve lasting and comprehensive reforms of the UN Security Council. Our Group is bound by the firm conviction that expansion in both the permanent and non-permanent categories of membership of the Security Council is imperative to better reflect contemporary world realities, and achieve a more accountable, representative, transparent and more importantly a 'relevant' Security Council. We would like to begin by congratulating you for what you have provided to the General Assembly today.A landmark and historic decision which fundamentally sets the UNSC reforms process on a text based negotiation path, based on the text and its annexes as circulated vide your letter of 31 July 2015.As a leading pro-reform constituency, the L.69 Group {{was one of the first}} groups, which had complimented you and the Chair for tabling the negotiation text through your letter of 31 July. To us, it was the outcome of a process that was truly “consultative, transparent and inclusive” as you very rightly alluded to in your own communication. You also informed the membership through your letter that quote “ given this text’s adherence to GA Decision 62/557, it represents a sound basis upon which member states can engage in text based negotiations during the next phase of the IGN” unquote.We are therefore heartened to note that this text has been unanimously recognized by the entire GA membership by consensus in today’s decision on UNSC reform, and that it is being carried forward as the basis of our work in the next round of the IGN in the 70th UNGA. The L.69 Group of Developing countries would also like to place on record our appreciation to the Chair of the IGN, H.E Courtenay Rattray for having steered this process so deftly through ‘mostly troubled waters’ but having emerged a clear winner with this consensus decision on his text today.It was unfortunate though that the same set of voices who have continued to work actively against any kind of reform process, did not even join in to the simple request of the Chair to provide inputs to the framework document. Every process in the UN works on the basis of a text, that is populated by the Chair based on views of each and every member state. But in this case, the anti-reform voices have been completely exposed as by not providing inputs to what has been a most transparent and inclusive process, they have shown to the rest of the membership, that what they fear is not the eventual outcome, but even the very first steps of a tangible text based negotiation path to be initiated in the UNGA.And therefore the adoption of today’s decision is a game - changing development in the ‘shadow boxing’ that has largely been conducted behind the scenes so far. Mr. President, today’s UNGA Decision A/69/L.92 clearly establishes two unique firsts.One it in its OP-2 it clearly “decides to immediately continue IGN on SC Reform” , building on informal meetings held during 69th session, “as well as on the positions of and proposals made by member states reflected in the text and its annex circulated by the PGA in his letter dated 31 July 2015”.This therefore established that we will commence our work in the 70th GA on the text circulated on 31 July, and work further upon it in the hope to reach the eventual least bracketed text that we are all looking for. Two, the other significant development vide your today’s decision is also noteworthy. For the first time we do not have a mere “rolling over” but a substantive, concrete formally written official L Document of the UNGA, which has been adopted by consensus by the entire membership. This shift from an oral to a formal UNGA decision is most welcome given its substantive content that firmly establishes text based negotiations on the Chair’s text.The L.69 Group of Developing countries welcomes both these changes, and applauds you and your leadership in staying the course when it came to the crunch time on this long intractable subject of reforming the UN Security Council.Mr. President,As had been wisely said that quote “ the distance is nothing, it is only the first step that is difficult” unquoteWith the adoption of this decision formally by the UNGA, we have taken that very important first step that was needed in this long stalled process. We have traversed seventy years of UN’s life time this year, but today’s <b>collective</b> <b>achievement</b> by the entire membership sets our journey on this subject on a firm footing and on a solid basis, in this organization’s seventieth year. Over the last years, we were all asking the Chair to produce a negotiation text but we never got one. With this decision in place, we know that we have a text in place that’s recognized undisputedly by the entire membership. Now, therefore it becomes critical that we move further ahead with a 'results based time line' as an absolute imperative. As some one had rightly said : “ Goals are dreams with deadlines”, so if we have to UNSC reform as a realistic goal, we need to have a realistic time line as well to reach that goal.Using facile arguments of not imposing artificial time lines, while calling for fixed time lines in all other UN processes, only reflects of our doublespeak and would epitomize our collective failure to address an issue of urgent and pressing importance. It is our Group's firm conviction that this historic year 2015, which is the 70th Anniversary of the United Nations, as well as 10 years following the 2005 World Summit when all our Heads of States/Governments mandated us to achieve early reforms of the Security Council, is an important opportunity to show decisive progress and finally deliver results on that unanimous mandate. I thank you Mr. President. Ambassador Menissa Rambally, on Behalf of the L.69 Group, 14 September 2015 ...|$|E

25|$|The impalement arts {{have evolved}} {{as the product}} of a history of {{performance}} dating back to at least the 19th century. That heritage, and especially the <b>collective</b> <b>achievements</b> of notable performers, helps to define the subject. As with other performance arts, judgements about who might be the most notable are highly subjective and clouded by the hyperbole of publicity. For similar reasons it is also sometimes difficult to resolve debates about who originated particular stunts. Nevertheless, some names recur frequently in historical records and current news. Some are recognised for pioneering achievements, some for bringing the arts to widespread audiences and some as distinctive characters who, although less famous, have had significant influence on their peers. Because this is not a league table of merit and because overlaps make a chronological presentation awkward, they are presented here in alphabetic order under the two main disciplines.|$|R

The book relates how, while initially consisting of cell biologists, the Chinese biophysics community redirected their disciplinary priorities toward rocket science in the late 1950 s to accommodate the national interests of the time. Biophysicists who had worked on biological sounding rockets were drawn to the military sector and continued to contribute to human spaceflight in post-Mao China. Besides the rocket-and-space missions which provided the material context for biophysics to expand in the late 1950 s and early 1960 s, Chinese biophysicists also created research and educational programs surrounding biophysics by exploiting the institutional opportunities afforded by the policy emphasis on science's role to drive modernization.
