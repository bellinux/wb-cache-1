5|$|Some Giant Schnauzers develop central {{diabetes}} insipidus, {{autosomal recessive}} hypothyroidism, selective malabsorption of cobalamin, narcolepsy, <b>cataplexy,</b> and various seizure disorders. Some are also sensitive to sulphonamides and gold. Bone diseases and joint problems are also an issue. The most common {{causes of death}} in Giant Schnauzers are lymphoma and liver cancer, followed by heart attacks and heart failure.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cataplexy</b> {{associated}} with narcolepsy. Which is a TGA and MHRA-labeled indication for clomipramine.|$|E
25|$|Another FDA-approved {{treatment}} {{option for}} narcolepsy is sodium oxybate, {{also known as}} sodium gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB). It {{can be used for}} <b>cataplexy</b> associated with narcolepsy and excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy.|$|E
25|$|GHB is {{the active}} {{ingredient}} in the prescription medication sodium oxybate (Xyrem). Sodium oxybate is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{for the treatment of}} <b>cataplexy</b> associated with narcolepsy and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) associated with narcolepsy.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis is {{relatively}} easy when all the symptoms of narcolepsy are present, but if the sleep attacks are isolated and <b>cataplexy</b> is mild or absent, diagnosis is more difficult. It is also possible for <b>cataplexy</b> to occur in isolation. Three tests that are commonly used in diagnosing narcolepsy are the polysomnogram, the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), and administration of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. These tests are usually performed by a sleep specialist. The polysomnogram involves continuous recording of sleep brain waves {{and a number of}} nerve and muscle functions during night time sleep. When tested, people with narcolepsy fall asleep rapidly, enter REM sleep early, and may often awaken during the night. The polysomnogram also helps to detect other possible sleep disorders that could cause daytime sleepiness.|$|E
25|$|While {{there is}} no cure, a number of {{lifestyle}} changes and medications may help. Lifestyle changes include taking regular short naps and sleep hygiene. Medications used include modafinil, sodium oxybate, and methylphenidate. While initially effective, tolerance to the benefits may develop over time. Tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may improve <b>cataplexy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Narcolepsy has {{sometimes}} been treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants, such as clomipramine, imipramine, or protriptyline, {{as well as other}} drugs that suppress REM sleep. Venlafaxine, an antidepressant which blocks the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, has shown usefulness in managing symptoms of <b>cataplexy,</b> however, it has notable side-effects including sleep disruption.|$|E
25|$|Fluoxetine is {{frequently}} {{used to treat}} major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bulimia nervosa, panic disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and trichotillomania. It has also been used for <b>cataplexy,</b> obesity, and alcohol dependence, as well as binge eating disorder. It has also been tried {{as a treatment for}} autism spectrum disorders with moderate success in adults.|$|E
25|$|It can be {{difficult}} to differentiate between <b>cataplexy</b> brought on by narcolepsy and true sleep paralysis, because the two phenomena are physically indistinguishable. The best way to differentiate between the two is to note when the attacks occur most often. Narcolepsy attacks are more common when the individual is falling asleep; ISP and RISP attacks are more common upon awakening.|$|E
25|$|GHB {{has been}} used in a medical setting as a general {{anesthetic}} and as a treatment for <b>cataplexy,</b> narcolepsy, and alcoholism. It is also used illegally as an intoxicant, to try to increase athletic performance, and as a date rape drug. It is commonly used {{in the form of a}} salt, such as sodium γ-hydroxybutyrate (Na.GHB, sodium oxybate, or Xyrem) or potassium γ-hydroxybutyrate (K.GHB, potassium oxybate).|$|E
25|$|Due to its {{action on}} both the serotoninergic and {{adrenergic}} systems, venlafaxine is also used as a treatment to reduce episodes of <b>cataplexy,</b> a form of muscle weakness, in patients with the sleep disorder narcolepsy. Some open-label and three double-blind studies have suggested the efficacy of venlafaxine {{in the treatment of}} attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Clinical trials have found possible efficacy in those with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).|$|E
25|$|However, “there is no {{evidence}} that the pathophysiology or therapeutic response is substantially different for hypersomnia with or without SOREMPs on the MSLT.” Given this currently understood overlap of idiopathic hypersomnia and narcolepsy, the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) is also updating its classification of the primary hypersomnias. It reclassifies narcolepsy without <b>cataplexy</b> as major somnolence disorder (MSD). Additionally, MSD will encompass all syndromes of hypersomnolence not explained by low orexin concentrations, including idiopathic hypersomnia (with and without long sleep time) and long sleepers (people requiring >10hours sleep/day).|$|E
25|$|Harvey Irwin (1985) {{presented}} {{a theory of}} the OBE involving attentional cognitive processes and somatic sensory activity. His theory involved a cognitive personality construct known as psychological absorption and gave instances of the classification of an OBE as examples of autoscopy, depersonalization and mental dissociation. The psychophysiologist Stephen Laberge (1985) has written that the explanation for OBEs {{can be found in}} lucid dreaming. David Hufford (1989) linked the OBE experience with a phenomenon he described as a nightmare waking experience, a type of sleep paralysis. Other scientists have also linked OBEs to cases of hypnagogia and sleep paralysis (<b>cataplexy).</b>|$|E
25|$|The exact {{cause of}} {{narcolepsy}} is unknown with potentially several causes. In up to 10% of cases {{there is a}} family history of the disorder. Often those affected have low levels of the neuropeptide orexin which may be due to an autoimmune disorder. Trauma, infections, toxins, or psychological stress may also play a role. Diagnosis is typically based on the symptoms and sleep studies, after ruling out other potential causes. Excessive daytime sleepiness can also be caused by other sleep disorders such as sleep apnea, major depressive disorder, anemia, heart failure, drinking alcohol, and not getting enough sleep. <b>Cataplexy</b> may be mistaken for seizures.|$|E
25|$|In most cases, {{the first}} symptom of {{narcolepsy}} to appear is excessive and overwhelming daytime sleepiness. The other symptoms may begin {{alone or in}} combination months or years after {{the onset of the}} daytime naps. There are wide variations in the development, severity, and order of appearance of <b>cataplexy,</b> sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations in individuals. Only about 20 to 25 percent of people with narcolepsy experience all four symptoms. The excessive daytime sleepiness generally persists throughout life, but sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations may not. A rare subset of narcoleptics also experience a heightened sense of taste and smell known as the supertaster phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|A sleep {{disorder}}, or somnipathy, is {{a medical}} disorder of the sleep patterns of a person or animal. Polysomnography is a test commonly used for diagnosing some sleep disorders. Sleep disorders are broadly classified into dyssomnias, parasomnias, circadian rhythm sleep disorders, and other disorders including ones caused by medical or psychological conditions and sleeping sickness. Some common sleep disorders include insomnia (chronic inability to sleep), sleep apnea (abnormally low breathing during sleep), narcolepsy (excessive sleepiness at inappropriate times), <b>cataplexy</b> (sudden and transient loss of muscle tone), and sleeping sickness (disruption of sleep cycle due to infection). Other disorders that are being studied include sleepwalking, sleep terror and bed wetting.|$|E
25|$|Narcolepsy is a {{long-term}} neurological disorder that involves a decreased ability to regulate sleep-wake cycles. Symptoms include periods of excessive daytime sleepiness that usually last from seconds to minutes and may occur at any time. About 70% of those affected also experience episodes of sudden loss of muscle strength, known as <b>cataplexy.</b> These spells can be brought on by strong emotions. Less commonly there may be inability to move or vivid hallucinations while falling asleep or waking up. People with narcolepsy tend to sleep {{about the same number}} of hours per day as people without, but the quality of sleep tends to be worse.|$|E
25|$|The neural {{control of}} normal sleep {{states and the}} {{relationship}} to narcolepsy are only partially understood. In humans, narcoleptic sleep {{is characterized by a}} tendency to go abruptly from a waking state to REM sleep with little or no intervening non-REM sleep. The changes in the motor and proprioceptive systems during REM sleep have been studied in both human and animal models. During normal REM sleep, spinal and brainstem alpha motor neuron hyperpolarization produces almost complete atonia of skeletal muscles via an inhibitory descending reticulospinal pathway. Acetylcholine {{may be one of the}} neurotransmitters involved in this pathway. In narcolepsy, the reflex inhibition of the motor system seen in <b>cataplexy</b> has features normally seen only in normal REM sleep.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people with}} {{narcolepsy}} also suffer from insomnia {{for extended periods}} of time. The excessive daytime sleepiness and <b>cataplexy</b> often become severe enough to cause serious problems in a person's social, personal, and professional life. Normally, when an individual is awake, brain waves show a regular rhythm. When a person first falls asleep, the brain waves become slower and less regular, which is called non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. After {{about an hour and}} a half of NREM sleep, the brain waves begin to show a more active pattern again, called REM sleep (rapid eye movement sleep), when most remembered dreaming occurs. Associated with the EEG-observed waves during REM sleep, muscle atonia is present called REM atonia.|$|E
25|$|In narcolepsy, {{the order}} and length of NREM and REM sleep periods are disturbed, with REM sleep {{occurring}} at sleep onset instead of {{after a period of}} NREM sleep. Also, some aspects of REM sleep that normally occur only during sleep, like lack of muscular control, sleep paralysis, and vivid dreams, occur at other times in people with narcolepsy. For example, the lack of muscular control can occur during wakefulness in a <b>cataplexy</b> episode; it is said that there is intrusion of REM atonia during wakefulness. Sleep paralysis and vivid dreams can occur while falling asleep or waking up. Simply put, the brain does not pass through the normal stages of dozing and deep sleep but goes directly into (and out of) rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.|$|E
25|$|Neurological {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} include cerebellar ataxia (unsteady walking with uncoordinated limb movements), dysarthria (slurred speech), dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing), tremor, epilepsy (both partial and generalized), vertical supranuclear palsy (upgaze palsy, downgaze palsy, saccadic palsy or paralysis), sleep inversion, gelastic <b>cataplexy</b> (sudden loss of muscle tone or drop attacks), dystonia (abnormal movements or postures caused by contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles across joints), most commonly begins with in turning of one foot when walking (action dystonia) and may spread to become generalized, spasticity (velocity dependent increase in muscle tone), hypotonia, ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid), microcephaly (abnormally small head), psychosis, progressive dementia, progressive hearing loss, bipolar disorder, major and psychotic depression that can include hallucinations, delusions, mutism, or stupor.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, it is {{estimated}} that this condition afflicts as many as 200,000 Americans, but fewer than 50,000 are diagnosed. It is as widespread as Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis and more prevalent than cystic fibrosis, but it is less well known. Narcolepsy is often mistaken for depression, epilepsy, or the side effects of medications. It can also be mistaken for poor sleeping habits, recreational drug use, or laziness. Narcolepsy can occur in both men and women at any age, although its symptoms are usually first noticed in teenagers or young adults. There is strong evidence that narcolepsy may run in families; around 10 percent of people diagnosed with narcolepsy with <b>cataplexy</b> have a close relative with this neurological disorder. While narcolepsy symptoms are often confused with depression, there is a link between the two disorders. Research studies have mixed results on co-occurrence of depression in narcolepsy patients - the numbers quoted by different studies are anywhere between 6% and 50%.|$|E
2500|$|The 2001 International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) divides primary {{hypersomnia}} syndromes between narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia, and the recurrent hypersomnias (like Klein-Levin syndrome); {{it further}} divides narcolepsy into that with <b>cataplexy</b> and that without <b>cataplexy.</b> [...] This ICSD version defines narcolepsy as a disorder of unknown cause [...] "that {{is characterized by}} excessive sleepiness that typically is associated with <b>cataplexy</b> and other REM-sleep phenomena, such as sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations". It also establishes baseline categorical standards for diagnosis of narcolepsy, through 2 sets of well defined criteria, as follows.|$|E
2500|$|Further complicating these updated {{classification}} schemes, {{overlap between}} narcolepsy with <b>cataplexy</b> and idiopathic hypersomnia {{has also been}} reported. [...] A subgroup of narcoleptics with long sleep time, comprising 18% of narcoleptics in one study, had symptoms of both narcolepsy with <b>cataplexy</b> and idiopathic hypersomnia (long sleep time and unrefreshing naps). It is believed that this subgroup might have dysfunction in multiple arousal systems, including orexin and GABA (see idiopathic hypersomnia causes).|$|E
2500|$|<b>Cataplexy</b> is an episodic loss {{of muscle}} function, ranging from slight {{weakness}} such as limpness {{at the neck}} or knees, sagging facial muscles, weakness at the knees {{often referred to as}} [...] "knee buckling", or inability to speak clearly, to a complete body collapse. Episodes may be triggered by sudden emotional reactions such as laughter, anger, surprise, or fear, and may last from a few seconds to several minutes. The person remains conscious throughout the episode. In some cases, <b>cataplexy</b> may resemble epileptic seizures. Usually speech is slurred and vision is impaired (double vision, inability to focus), but hearing and awareness remain normal. <b>Cataplexy</b> also has a severe emotional impact on narcoleptics, as it can cause extreme anxiety, fear, and avoidance of people or situations that might elicit an attack. <b>Cataplexy</b> is generally considered to be unique to narcolepsy and is analogous to sleep paralysis in that the usually protective paralysis mechanism occurring during sleep is inappropriately activated. The opposite of this situation (failure to activate this protective paralysis) occurs in rapid eye movement behavior disorder.|$|E
2500|$|The classic {{symptoms}} of the disorder, {{often referred to as}} the [...] "tetrad of narcolepsy," [...] are <b>cataplexy,</b> sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Other symptoms may include automatic behaviors and night-time wakefulness. [...] These symptoms may not occur in all patients.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the absence}} of clear <b>cataplexy,</b> it becomes much more {{difficult}} to make a firm diagnosis of narcolepsy. “Various terms, such as essential hypersomnia, primary hypersomnia, ambiguous narcolepsy, atypical narcolepsy, etc., have been used to classify these patients, who may be in the developing phase of narcolepsy.” ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{link between}} GlaxoSmithKline's H1N1 flu vaccine Pandemrix and {{childhood}} narcolepsy was investigated {{due to increased}} prevalence of narcolepsy in Irish, Finnish and Swedish children after vaccinations. Finland's National Institute of Health and Welfare recommended that Pandemrix vaccinations be suspended pending further investigation into 15 reported cases of children developing narcolepsy. [...] In Finland in mid-November 2010, 37 cases of children's narcolepsy had been reported by doctors. This {{can be compared to}} the normal average of 3 cases of children's narcolepsy per year. [...] "The incidence of narcolepsy with <b>cataplexy</b> in children/adolescents in the Swedish population increased during the pandemic and vaccination period, with a rapid decline in incidence during the post pandemic period." [...] They concluded that these results [...] "provide strengthened evidence that vaccination with Pandemrix during the pandemic period could be associated with an increase in the risk for narcolepsy with <b>cataplexy</b> in predisposed children/adolescents 19 years and younger." [...] In 2013, the link between Pandemrix and narcolepsy was confirmed by a registry study by the Swedish Medical Products Agency, with a three-fold increase in risk for people under the age of 20.|$|E
2500|$|Since the 2001 ICSD, the {{classification}} of primary hypersomnias has been steadily evolving, as further research has shown more overlap between narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia. The 3rd edition of the ICSD is currently being finalized, and its new classification will label narcolepsy caused by orexin deficiency as “type 1 narcolepsy,” which is almost always associated with <b>cataplexy.</b> [...] The other primary hypersomnias will remain subdivided based {{on the presence of}} SOREMPs. They will be labeled: “type 2 narcolepsy,” with 2 or more SOREMPs on MSLT; and “idiopathic hypersomnia,” with less than 2 SOREMPS.|$|E
2500|$|Lack of REM atonia causes REM {{behavior}} disorder, sufferers {{of which}} physically act out their dreams, or conversely [...] "dream out their acts", under an alternative theory {{on the relationship}} between muscle impulses during REM and associated mental imagery (which would also apply to people without the condition, except that commands to their muscles are suppressed). This is different from conventional sleepwalking, which takes place during slow-wave sleep, not REM. Narcolepsy by contrast seems to involve excessive and unwanted REM atonia—i.e., <b>cataplexy</b> and excessive daytime sleepiness while awake, hypnagogic hallucinations before entering slow-wave sleep, or sleep paralysis while waking. Other psychiatric disorders including depression have been linked to disproportionate REM sleep. Patients with suspected sleep disorders are typically evaluated by polysomnogram.|$|E
2500|$|GHB can {{be easily}} {{manufactured}} with very little knowledge of chemistry, as it only involves the mixing of its two precursors, GBL and an alkali hydroxide, such as sodium hydroxide, to form the resulting GHB salt. Due to the ease of manufacture {{and the availability of}} its precursors, it is not mainly produced in illicit laboratories like most other synthetic drugs, but in private homes by low level producers instead. While available as a prescription for rare and severe forms of sleep disorders such as narcolepsy in some other countries, notably most of Europe, GHB was banned in the U.S. by the FDA in 1990. However, on 17 July 2002, GHB was approved for treatment of <b>cataplexy,</b> often associated with narcolepsy. GHB is [...] "colourless and odorless".|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} {{circumvent}} the ban on GHB, do it yourself packages were put on the market with which oneself could easily make GHB. These contained the basic raw materials to be mixed as well as instructions in order (in the proper proportions). The main ingredients for homemade GHB are still (separately) freely available commercially in the Netherlands (GBL (gamma-butyrolactone) or 1,4-butanediol, which is used as the alkaline industrial cleaning agent, sodium hydroxide, {{which can be found}} in drain cleaner, and distilled water or ethanol). Since 2005, GHB is medically used under the brand name [...] Xyrem [...] for the treatment of narcolepsy with <b>cataplexy.</b> In 2011 the party drug was placed on the list of hard drugs by the Dutch government, making it illegal other than for medical use prescribed by a doctor. Also it is in addiction clinics used during detoxification of GHB in a reduction schedule to prevent severe withdrawal symptoms.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cataplexy</b> is {{a sudden}} and {{transient}} episode of muscle weakness accompanied by full conscious awareness, typically triggered by emotions such as laughing, crying, or terror. [...] <b>Cataplexy</b> affects approximately 70% {{of people who have}} narcolepsy, and is caused by an autoimmune destruction of the neurotransmitter hypocretin (also called orexin), which regulates arousal and wakefulness. <b>Cataplexy</b> without narcolepsy is rare and the cause is unknown.|$|E
50|$|Laughter-induced syncope {{should not}} be {{confused}} with <b>cataplexy,</b> a sudden loss of muscle tone triggered by strong emotions, particularly laughter. Unlike syncope, there is no loss of consciousness in <b>cataplexy,</b> which affects some sufferers of narcolepsy.|$|E
50|$|Zimelidine was {{reported}} by Montplaisir and Godbout to be very effective for <b>cataplexy</b> in 1986, back when this was usually controlled by tricyclic antidepressants, which often had anticholinergic effects. Zimelidine was able to improve <b>cataplexy</b> without causing daytime sleepiness.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cataplexy</b> is {{considered}} secondary {{when it is}} due to specific lesions in the brain that cause a depletion of the hypocretin neurotransmitter. Secondary <b>cataplexy</b> is associated with specific lesions located primarily in the lateral and posterior hypothalamus. <b>Cataplexy</b> due to brainstem lesions is uncommon particularly when seen in isolation. The lesions include tumors of the brain or brainstem and arterio-venous malformations. Some of the tumors include astrocytoma, glioblastoma, glioma, and subependynoma. These lesions can be visualized with brain imaging, however in their early stages they can be missed. Other conditions in which <b>cataplexy</b> can be seen include ischemic events, multiple sclerosis, head injury, paraneoplastic syndromes, and infections such as encephalitis. <b>Cataplexy</b> may also occur transiently or permanently due to lesions of the hypothalamus that were caused by surgery, especially in difficult tumor resections. These lesions or generalized processes disrupt the hypocretin neurons and their pathways. The neurological process behind the lesion impairs pathways controlling the normal inhibition of muscle tone drop, consequently resulting in muscle atonia.|$|E
