[...] " [...] 'Truth' is our small <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> that you try and understand someone who lives their life {{in a way that is}} a little bit different from yours, even though all of our hearts are the same.

Stewie decides to spend the whole day with the cast, which includes stealing Cleveland's van, having lunch at McDonald's, going bowling, and going to a carnival. However, they complain about minor things and greatly annoy Stewie, who beams everyone back after stating that they have ruined Star Trek: The Next Generation for him, and that he hopes they all die.|$|E

6000|$|Now, {{it must be}} {{told that}} little Olaf was {{particularly}} fond of Snorro, and, if one might judge from appearances, Snorro reciprocated the attachment. Whenever Snorro happened to be missed, it was generally understood that Olaf had him. If any one <b>chanced</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the question, [...] "Where is Snorro?" [...] the almost invariable reply was, [...] "Ask Olaf." [...] In the event of Olaf not having him, it was quite unnecessary for any one <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> where he was, because {{the manner in which}} he raged about the hamlet shouting, howling, absolutely yelling, for [...] "O'af!" [...] was a sufficient indication of his whereabouts.|$|R
5000|$|The hacker then reveals {{herself to}} be Grace Goodwin, whose sole mission is to get herself off the naughty list, believing {{that she had been}} set up by her toddler brother, who had {{destroyed}} her favorite toy and ruined her <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Santa for a new one by his crying. After a somewhat intoxicated Lanny suggests using the [...] "magic word" [...] to get the password for the device that will get her off the list, she does just that: using the word [...] "please" [...] as the password, since genuinely naughty kids never say [...] "please." [...] At first, she appears successful in changing her status from naughty to nice, but the device malfunctions, threatening to place the entire planet on the naughty list unless she and the team can pull off a risky operation to fix the problem.|$|R
2500|$|According to Jeff C. Riddle, the Modoc {{son of the}} US {{interpreter}} and {{the author}} of Indian History of the Modoc War (1914), the Modoc had plotted before the meeting to kill Canby and the other commissioners, as they believed peace was not possible. [...] They were determined to [...] "fight until we die." [...] (He was the son of Winema and Frank Riddle.) Captain Jack had been reluctant to agree to the killings, believing it [...] "coward's work," [...] but was pressured by other warriors to agree. He insisted on being given another <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Canby to [...] "give us a home in our country." [...] When Canby said {{he did not have the}} authority to make such a promise, Captain Jack attacked the general. With Ellen's Man, one of his lieutenants, he shot Canby twice in the head and cut his throat. The Modoc also killed Reverend Eleazar Thomas, a peace commissioner, and wounded others in the party. Canby was the only general to be killed during the Indian Wars.|$|E

40|$|This article {{discusses}} about a kind {{of efforts}} to enhance students‟ ability in questioning of what they study. One problem {{in teaching and learning}} activities is that students are reluctant <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> questions during teaching and learning process, even though teachers already give students many <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> whatever they do not understand yet. This problem is always annoying teachers to create an interactive class in which two-way communication between a teacher and students is going on during teaching and learning process. There are many possibilities that cause the problem, therefore teachers should investigate and overcome the problem. The author of this article conjectures that students have good skills of questioning when they have responsibility of what they learn. This theory will come true if teachers can design class activities in which students are motivated to have courage <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> questions based on what they already learned. The author formulates a way <b>to</b> prompt students <b>asking</b> questions by combining punishment, reward, and hierarchy of questions. This strategy of teaching uses punishment and reward to make students aware of what they ask and answer, meanwhile hierarchy of questions is used to induce students to bear prior knowledge of questions they ask. All these things help students to improve their ability of questioning with responsibility of what they learn. Keywords: ability in questioning, reward-punishment, teaching strateg...|$|R

Knockdunder, however, desirous, he said, of knowing what stuff was in the new minister, had no intention to part with him so easily, but kept him pinned to his side, watching him sedulously, and with obliging violence filling his glass to the brim, as often as he could seize an opportunity of doing so. At length, as the evening was wearing late, a venerable brother <b>chanced</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Mr. Archibald when they might hope to see the Duke, tam carum caput, as he would venture to term him, at the Lodge of Roseneath. Duncan of Knock, whose ideas were somewhat conglomerated, and who, it may be believed, was no great scholar, catching up some imperfect sound of the words, conceived the speaker was drawing a parallel between the Duke and Sir Donald Gorme of Sleat; and being of opinion that such comparison was odious, snorted thrice, and prepared himself to be in a passion.|$|R
