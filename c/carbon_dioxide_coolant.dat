In machining, friction and heat generation at the cutting zone are the frequent problems, which affect the tool life and surface finish.

40|$|Beryllium is a favoured canning and/or moderating {{material}} in the proposed Australian High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactor. With <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> as the most likely coolant a detailed knowledge of the corrosion of beryllium in this gas is required. Two separate investigations have proceeded simultaneously. First {{the effect of the}} following variables was studied; surface preparation of the specimen, temperature (100 — 725 ºC), pressure (0 — 280 p. s. i. g.), velocity, and impurity content of the gas. The influence of irradiation has not yet been studied. Autoclaves, thermobalances, and dynamic loops were used. The results were statistically analysed and kinetic data obtained. In all cases specimens with etched surfaces yielded approximately 25 — 30 per cent, greater weight gains than specimens with ground or polished surfaces. On extruded material no "breakaway" oxidation was encountered below 650 ºC in commercially dry gas (< 20 p. p. m. moisture). The rate of attack was to some extent affected by the pressure of the gas. Breakaway was only observed in one series of specimens at 650 ºC. In this particular case the gas pressure was 280 p. s. i. g. However, it seems that surface temperatures of beryllium cans made from extruded material should be maintained below 650 ºC in a reactor system using the commercially pure <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> as <b>coolant.</b> In the second approach a more basic study of the chemistry of the reaction was made as well as a detailed investigation into the variation caused by differences in the composition and fabrication of the metal.

50|$|On 3 December 1977 The Times {{reported}} that seawater {{had entered the}} reactor through a modification of the secondary cooling system. The secondary cooling system uses fresh water to cool various items including the bearings of the gas circulators, which circulate the <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> (CO2) <b>coolant</b> through the reactor to the boilers. A small leak of CO2 through a seal had developed, and a bypass pipe was installed to remove the water contaminated with CO2 to the seawater cooling ponds. When maintenance work was carried out on the reactor and the pressure in the gas cooling system was reduced, sea water was able to flow back up this bypass pipe and into the reactor. The residual heat of the reactor was such that the seawater evaporated rapidly, leaving deposits of salt in the reactor around the gas circuit. It was estimated {{at the time that}} the reactor could be out of operation for a year, that the repairs could cost £14 million, and that electricity tariffs would have to rise by between 1 and 2 per cent. Extensive modelling work was performed in the Nuclear Power Company's (NPC) Whetstone, Leicestershire, fluid flow laboratories to determine where the salt would have been deposited, and the salt was successfully removed by technicians using vacuum cleaners and the plant returned to operation.|$|R

40|$|A {{major feature}} of the Magnox gas cooled reactor design is the {{graphite}} core, which acts as the moderator but also provides the physical structure for fuel, control rods, instrumentation and coolant gas channels. The lifetime of a graphite core is dependent upon two principal aging processes: irradiation damage and radiolytic oxidation. Irradiation damage from fast neutrons creates lattice defects leading to changes in physical and mechanical properties and the accumulation of stresses. Radiolytic oxidation {{is caused by the}} reaction of oxidizing species from the <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>coolant</b> gas with the graphite, these species being produced by gamma radiation. Radiolytic oxidation reduces the density and hence the moderating capability of the graphite, but also reduces strength affecting the integrity of core components. In order to manage continued operation over the planned lifetimes of their power stations, BNFL needed to extend their database of the effects of these two phenomena on the ir graphite cores through an irradiation experiment. This paper will discuss the background, purpose, and the processes taken and planned (i. e. post irradiation examination) to ensure meaningful data on the graphite core material is obtained from the irradiation experiment...|$|E
40|$|A Metabolic heat-regenerated Temperature Swing Adsorption (MTSA) {{system is}} being {{developed}} for <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide,</b> water and thermal control in a lunar and martian portable life support system (PLSS). A previous system analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of MTSA on PLSS design. That effort was Mars specific and assumed liquid <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> (LCO 2) <b>coolant</b> made from martian resources. Transient effects were not considered but rather average conditions were used throughout the analysis. This effort takes into further consideration the transient effects inherent in the cycling MTSA system as well as assesses the use of water as coolant. Standard heat transfer, thermodynamic, and heat exchanger methods are presented to conduct the analysis. Assumptions and model verification are discussed. The tool was used to perform various system studies. Coolant selection was explored and takes into account different operational scenarios as the minimum bed temperature {{is driven by the}} sublimation temperature of the coolant (water being significantly higher than LCO 2). From this, coolant mass is sized coupled with sorbent bed mass because MTSA adsorption performance decreases with increasing sublimation temperature. Reduction in heat exchanger performance and even removal of certain heat exchangers, like a recuperative one between the two sorbent beds, is also investigated. Finally, the coolant flow rate is varied over the cycle to determine if there is a more optimal means of cooling the bed from a mass perspective. Results of these studies and subsequent recommendations for system design are presented...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays total inlet {{temperature}} of gas turbine is {{far above the}} permissible metal temperature; as a consequence, advanced cooling techniques must be applied to protect from thermal stresses, oxidation and corrosion the components located in the high pressure stages, such as the blade trailing edge. A suitable design of the cooling system for the trailing edge has to cope with geometric constraints and aerodynamic demands; state-of-the-art of cooling concepts often use film cooling on blade pressure side: the air taken from last compressor stages is ejected through discrete holes or slots to provide a cold layer between hot mainstream and the blade surface. With the goal of ensuring a satisfactory lifetime of blades, the design of efficient trailing edge film cooling schemes and, moreover, the possibility to check carefully their behavior, are hence necessary to guarantee an appropriate metal temperature distribution. For this purpose an experimental survey was carried out to investigate the film covering performance of different pressure side trailing edge cooling systems for turbine blades. The experimental test section consists of a scaled-up trailing edge model installed in an open loop suction type test rig. Measurements of adiabatic effectiveness distributions were carried out on three trailing edge cooling system configurations. The baseline geometry is composed by inclined slots separated by elongated pedestals; the second geometry shares the same cutback configuration, with an additional row of circular film cooling holes located upstream; the third model is equipped with three rows of in-line film cooling holes.

40|$|Several {{methods have}} been {{developed}} previously for estimating cumulative energy production and plutonium production from graphite-moderated reactors. The Graphite Isotope Ratio Method (GIRM) is one well-known technique. This method {{is based on the}} measurement of trace isotopes in the reactor?s graphite matrix to determine the change in their isotopic ratios due to burnup. These measurements are then coupled with reactor calculations to determine the total plutonium and energy production of the reactor. To facilitate sensitivity analysis of these methods, a one-group cross section and fission product yield library for the fuel and graphite activation products has been developed for MAGNOX-style reactors. This library is intended for use in the ORIGEN computer code, which calculates the buildup, decay, and processing of radioactive materials. The library was developed using a fuel cell model in Monteburns. This model consisted of a single fuel rod including natural uranium metal fuel, magnesium cladding, <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>coolant,</b> and Grade A United Kingdom (UK) graphite.
