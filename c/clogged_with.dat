5|$|August 27–28, 1878 – Streets are <b>clogged</b> <b>with</b> fallen {{trees as}} a {{hurricane}} passes to the north. At {{the height of}} a storm, a floating dry dock—the largest ever built at the time—is damaged after breaking from its moorings at HM Dockyard, crushing wharves and a mooring bridge. The dock came to rest on a breakwater.|$|E
5|$|Acne, {{also known}} as acne vulgaris, is a {{long-term}} skin disease that occurs when hair follicles are <b>clogged</b> <b>with</b> dead skin cells and oil from the skin. It is characterized by blackheads or whiteheads, pimples, oily skin, and possible scarring. It primarily affects areas of the skin with a relatively high number of oil glands, including the face, {{upper part of the}} chest, and back. The resulting appearance can lead to anxiety, reduced self-esteem and, in extreme cases, depression or thoughts of suicide.|$|E
5|$|The canal {{gradually}} became <b>clogged</b> <b>with</b> weed, and the railway took {{much of the}} trade. Between 1870 and 1874, income dropped from £2,500 to £1,700. Three years later, the Bristol and Exeter Railway merged with the Great Western Railway. The new owners were remote, and {{were more interested in}} the water supply for Taunton station and for the Bridgwater Dock, than running the canal as a going concern, with the result that the canal deteriorated further. The Conservators continued their annual inspections, but had little hope of any improvements being made.|$|E

25|$|Regular {{maintenance}} {{is crucial to}} ensure that the system does not <b>clog</b> <b>with</b> sediments and that the desired infiltration rate is maintained. This includes checking and maintaining the pre-treatment by periodic inspections and cleaning of clogged material.|$|R
50|$|Tsarouchia (τσαρούχια, singular: τσαρούχι), {{red leather}} <b>clogs</b> <b>with</b> black pompons (φούντες, foundes; singular: φούντα, founda). Under the sole, {{depending}} on the size, there are 60 to 120 nails. On average each tsarouchi weighs approximately 1.5 kilos (3.5 pounds).|$|R
5|$|In 1552 {{the fort}} was decommissioned, but was {{subsequently}} recommissioned by Mary I. In {{addition to the}} fort's military role, it hosted a court to oversee the oysterfields along the East Mersea coast, which were particularly lucrative but at risk of overfishing. In 1566, Colchester introduced new rules to govern the oyster trade, which were enforced by an admiralty court, held when necessary in Mersea Fort; the location was chosen so as to demonstrate the town's authority {{all the way up}} to the top of the estuary. A survey in 1586 showed the fort had been abandoned by the military once again: the defences were in a poor state, the guns' barrels were <b>clogged</b> <b>with</b> dirt and the site had been occupied by an elderly woman. It was brought back into use in 1588 and 1631 to defend against first the Spanish Armada and then the Dunkirker privateers.|$|E
5|$|The {{landing at}} Juno was delayed because of choppy seas, {{and the men}} arrived ahead of their {{supporting}} armour, suffering many casualties while disembarking. Most of the offshore bombardment had missed the German defences. Several exits from the beach were created, but not without difficulty. At Mike Beach on the western flank, a large crater was filled using an abandoned AVRE tank and several rolls of fascine, which were then covered by a temporary bridge. The tank remained in place until 1972, when it was removed and restored {{by members of the}} Royal Engineers. The beach and nearby streets were <b>clogged</b> <b>with</b> traffic for most of the day, making it difficult to move inland.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of the nearby tropical cyclone caused the delaying of two flights and the cancellation of another at Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport. On Guam, the United States Navy ordered the release of ships from the local harbor. There, peaked at 251mm (9.90in) over a 24-hour period at Piti. At the National Weather Service office in Tiyan, a gauge observed 100mm (3.95in) of rain. Gusty winds were also associated with Saomai's outer rainbands, with gusts peaking at a measured 105km/h (66mph) on September4. The winds caused power outage in localized areas and downed two telephone poles. Severe flooding occurred in Merizo after a storm drain became <b>clogged</b> <b>with</b> debris, inundating six houses.|$|E
50|$|Tetsu geta (iron clogs) {{are worn}} like sandals, but {{requires}} gripping the <b>clogs</b> <b>with</b> one's toes. The practitioner then moves around and kicks while wearing these. The extra weight required {{to move the}} foot strengthens the leg for kicks.|$|R
5000|$|When a sink becomes stopped-up or clogged, {{a person}} will often resort {{to use a}} {{chemical}} drain cleaner or a plunger, though most professional plumbers will remove the <b>clog</b> <b>with</b> a drain auger (often called a [...] "plumber's snake").|$|R
50|$|English <b>clogs,</b> <b>with</b> leather uppers and a sole {{cut from}} alder or {{sycamore}} were the regular, everyday footwear for working {{people all over}} Britain until the 1920s. Because of the wooden sole, they gave better protection for the foot on cold or very hot floors. They were more resilient when working in wet conditions and they took longer to wear out than regular leather soles {{and then it was}} cheaper to reclog than to replace a leather sole. English dancing clogs are tight and close fitting which allows the dancer a lot of control over the movements of their feet. English <b>clogs</b> <b>with</b> an iron or rubber protective layer on the sole are also worn for North west morris.|$|R
5|$|The {{tax system}} was {{partially}} reformed in 1881, allowing for direct payment of road taxes instead of relying totally on the statute-labor system. The first road district {{larger than the}} township level was created in Bay County in 1883 under Public Act278. This road district encompassed eight townships and provided for better coordination and planning of road construction. Other county systems were created in 1893 with passage of legislation which allowed other counties to {{follow the lead of}} Bay County. By 1900, the plank roads were generally abandoned. While a few were still in good repair, most consisted of rotting logs with intermittent patches of gravel. Toll houses were empty shacks, and the ditches were <b>clogged</b> <b>with</b> duck ponds. Only 23 of the original 202plank roads chartered by the state were still in operation.|$|E
5|$|Widespread {{blizzard}} conditions wrought {{havoc on}} transportation; streets and highways throughout the hardest-hit areas were <b>clogged</b> <b>with</b> stalled and abandoned vehicles, and multiple major airports {{were forced to}} close. Many schools and businesses were closed, some for days after the storm departed. The New York Stock Exchange opened an hour late on December 12, marking its first delayed opening in over 25years. Extensive drifting of snow left communities isolated and unable to receive deliveries of food and heating fuel. Overall, the storm and subsequent cold snap were blamed for at least 286deaths across a wide area, but primarily in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and the New England states. The fatalities resulted from a multitude of tragedies, including automobile and maritime accidents, storm-related fires, carbon monoxide poisoning, over-exertion, and exposure to cold.|$|E
5|$|At Devil's Gate {{the rescue}} party {{unloaded}} the baggage {{carried in the}} wagons of the Hodgett and Hunt wagon companies that had been following the Martin Company so the wagons {{could be used to}} transport the weakest emigrants. A small group led by Daniel Webster Jones remained at Devil's Gate over the winter to protect the property. On November 4 the company had to cross the Sweetwater River, which was about 2 feet (0.6 m) deep and 90 to 120 feet (27 to 37 m) wide. The stream was <b>clogged</b> <b>with</b> floating ice. Some of the men of the rescue party spent hours pulling the carts and carrying many of the emigrants across the river. However, many members of the company crossed the river themselves, some even pulling their own handcarts across. The severe weather forced the Martin Company to halt for another five days at Martin's Cove, a few miles west of Devil's Gate.|$|E
50|$|Another oddity about Bow Brickill is {{that the}} road {{crossing}} here, the V10 Brickhill Street, has a roundabout immediately {{on either side of}} the crossing. This causes traffic jams whenever the crossing barriers are down, as each roundabout <b>clogs</b> <b>with</b> the traffic queue and remains so for up to ten minutes.|$|R

5|$|The scene {{there was}} chaotic. Large numbers of {{vehicles}} loaded with soldiers were {{moving down the}} road to the rear. Many soldiers on foot were on the road. Champney tried repeatedly but in vain to get these men to stop and turn around. The few North Korean mortar shells falling occasionally in the vicinity did no damage except to cause the troops of the 24th Infantry and intermingled South Koreans to panic further and increase their speed to the rear. The road was so <b>clogged</b> <b>with</b> retreating troops that Check had to delay his counterattack. In the six hours he waited at this point, Check observed that none of the retreating troops of the 1st and 2nd Battalions, 24th Infantry, could be assembled as units. Military police tried in vain to reassemble troops, but they refused even at gunpoint. At 16:00, the 2nd Battalion, 24th Infantry, assembling {{in the rear of the}} 27th Infantry, could muster only 150 to 200 men.|$|E
5|$|The sheer {{magnitude}} of the flood event in the Anilao–Malbasag watershed made the region more vulnerable to future flood events. Hillsides became more unstable and the rivers themselves were <b>clogged</b> <b>with</b> debris, raising their water levels and widening their banks. In a post-disaster assessment in October 1992, it was stated that swift cooperation of all agencies from local to governmental was necessary to prevent tragedies of similar caliber in the future. It was urged that residents still living along the river banks be relocated to safer areas; however, {{by the time of}} the report, people had already begun repopulating the area. As a way of avoiding similar breaching of the riverbank, it was suggested that the two rivers be dredged and possibly re-channeled. Several points were also brought up about rehabilitating the landscape of the watershed: reforestation, contoured farming, and redesigning of plantations to better retain rainwater. Long-term rehabilitation of the watershed was deemed necessary in addition to repairing infrastructure in Ormoc.|$|E
5|$|Yet more {{extraneous}} {{details were}} removed from the Pipe rolls under the Cowick Ordinance of June 1323, along with further ordinances in 1324 and 1326, all of which were done during the time that Walter de Stapledon held the office of Treasurer. Prior to this reform the rolls had become <b>clogged</b> <b>with</b> debts, and clauses 2 through 8 of the Cowick Ordinance attempted to return the rolls to an exposition of accounts. Another attempted reform at this time was the removal of customs receipts, as well as military accounts, from the rolls. New offices in the Exchequer were also created, in an attempt to speed up the auditing process and lessen the time it took to prepare the Pipe rolls and other financial records. The attempt to remove non-Exchequer accounts did completely remove those types of records from the Pipe rolls, and further reforms in 1368 created a set of foreign rolls, and all extraneous records in the Pipe rolls were transferred to those rolls.|$|E
500|$|... "Reducing {{the amount}} of {{phosphate}} in the water is the main driver behind the scheme.

5|$|Arguments soon {{broke out}} between the Crown and the {{corporation}} over the deal. The Crown argued that the corporation was not adequately maintaining the castle and blockhouses. The Earl of Sussex complained in 1569 {{that they were in}} need of repair, and a 1576 survey stated that their gun platforms were in poor condition and that the ditches had become <b>clogged</b> <b>with</b> earth, while coastal erosion had undermined the South Blockhouse. Queen Elizabeth I provided 300 trees to help the repair work and a new jetty was built to protect {{the southern end of the}} defences from the sea. The Crown gave 60 trees to the town to help with further repairs in 1581. Fears of a Spanish invasion resulted in fresh repairs being carried out, and the threat of the Armada in 1588 resulted in proposals to build additional earthworks around the blockhouses, but nothing appear to have actually been carried out. The dispute over maintenance between the Crown and the town finally came to court in 1588; the corporation argued that green timber had been used in the original construction work and claimed that they had spent £2,893 between 1552 and 1587 on the defences: the Crown's case failed.|$|E
5|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{released}} on 3 July 2006. Having been directed by Sophie Muller, it contained a vengeance theme, {{similar to that of}} the song. It starts off with Allen sitting on the bed in her apartment, eating chocolate and cheeseballs. Interleaved, there are shots of her and her ex-boyfriend spending time together appear as a memory. He is played by Elliott Jordan. As the bridge comes up, the scene changes to the singer standing on the corner of a street, talking to a man and paying him money. The man leaves and goes to some gangsters, giving them instructions and each a share of money. As Allen's former lover walks down the street talking on his mobile phone, one of the gangsters pushes him into an abandoned playground; where they are joined by a second gangster, and the pair give Allen's ex a beating. In this time, Allen, witnessing the scene, smiles. She then meets with her bruised ex-boyfriend, and takes him to a coffee shop. There, he tried to explain to her how he was beaten by the muggers, not knowing that, meanwhile, they were breaking down his apartment door and destroying his furniture and possessions, including scratching his gramophone records. The ex-boyfriend leaves the table for a while, enough time for Allen to put laxative pills in his coffee; upon returning, he drinks it and leaves the shop. After, he goes to his apartment, only to find it trashed and destroyed. Scavenging through what's left, he happily finds the record box, thinking they are intact, but he suddenly gets diarrhoea as a result of the laxatives, but is unable to use his toilet, as it is <b>clogged</b> <b>with</b> his clothes. He goes to Allen's apartment with his records, seeking consolation, unaware that she is laughing behind his back. As the video finishes, the scene changes to Allen walking down the street, at night, smiling, singing the last chorus, while her ex-boyfriend, actually a disc jockey, is in a nightclub, getting ready to put his music, but finds out that all his records have been scratched.|$|E

50|$|Leachate {{collection}} {{systems can}} experience many problems including <b>clogging</b> <b>with</b> mud or silt.
