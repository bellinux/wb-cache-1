40|$|Summary This paper uses a newly {{constructed}} cross-country database {{composed of}} <b>comparable</b> <b>income</b> aggregates {{to examine the}} full range of income generating activities carried out by rural households. The analysis paints a clear picture of multiple activities across rural space in countries on all four continents, though less so in the included African countries. For most countries the largest share of income stems from off-farm activities, and the largest share of households has diversified sources of income. Diversification, not specialization, is the norm. Nevertheless, agricultural sources of income remain critically important for rural livelihoods in all countries. rural non-farm income income diversification household surveys cross-country comparison...|$|E

These circumstances were highly effective in arresting high fertility rates. By the dawn of the twenty-first century, not only had China successfully carried out the transition toward a modern population growth pattern, but it was also able to be in less than 30  years.

Though our results may be period-specific, we also do not find evidence that the rate of return to capital is greater for whites than for African Americans.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} income inequality, based on ethno-racial origins. While Canada is proclaimed {{to be largely}} egalitarian, in light of its liberal {{policies}} and ideologies such as liberalism and multiculturalism, this thesis examines {{the extent to which}} economic inequality, manifested in income attainment is present in Canada. Building on past research, which have identified links between ethno-racial origin and identity, it provides a snapshot of the socio-economic standing of different ethno-racial groups, speaking to a part of the everyday lived experiences of different people residing in Canada. Using cycle 14 of the General Social Survey and factors related to income attainment such as human capital, social capital and socio-demographics, ordinary least squares regression showed that race and not ethnicity is an important predictor of income. That is, while all ethno-racial groups make <b>comparable</b> <b>incomes</b> with the British, visible minorities suffer significant income gaps in relation to this group. This difference is unexplained even after their higher educational attainments are considered. Finally, this project shows that human capital and socio-demographics are still the best predictors of income, while some factors of social capital improve income.

On the other hand adjusted gross income (AGI), the traditional tax measure of income, reached $ 2, 788 billion for 1987, an increase of 12. 3 percent, much of which was due to- definitional changes.

40|$|AbstractThis paper uses <b>comparable</b> <b>income</b> {{aggregates}} from 41 national household {{surveys from}} 22 countries {{to explore the}} patterns of income generation among rural households in Sub-Saharan Africa, and to compare household income strategies in Sub-Saharan Africa with those in other regions. The paper seeks to understand how geography drives these strategies, focusing {{on the role of}} agricultural potential and distance to urban areas. Specialization in on-farm activities continues to be the norm in rural Africa, practiced by 52 percent of households (as opposed to 21 percent of households in other regions). Regardless of distance and integration in the urban context, when agro-climatic conditions are favorable, farming remains the occupation of choice for most households in the African countries for which the study has geographically explicit information. However, the paper finds no evidence that African households are on a different trajectory than households in other regions in terms of transitioning to non-agricultural based income strategies...|$|E
40|$|Consider {{migration}} {{to a higher}} income region as a human capital investment in which parents bear migration costs and children share returns. Migrants from a population with heterogeneous intergenerational discount rates will be self-selected on intergenerational altruism. Thus, immigrants may be self-selected on fertility. Soviet Jews who migrate to Israel despite high migration costs have significantly more children than {{members of the same}} birth cohort who migrate later when costs are low. We distinguish selection from treatment effects using a comparison group of women who migrate after childbearing age. We also find that immigrants favor bequests more and spend more time with their grandchildren in the U. S. Health and Retirement Survey. Selection on altruism can explain why historically immigrant-absorbing countries like the U. S. have higher fertility than other countries at <b>comparable</b> <b>income</b> levels. It provides an alternative explanation for Chiswick's classic earnings-overtaking result. Selection on altruism also implies that immigrant-absorbing regions will grow faster, or have higher per capita income, or both. ...|$|E

This paper compares household energy transitions in these nations through {{the analysis of}} both aggregate statistics and nationally representative household surveys. The two countries differ sharply in several respects. Residential energy consumption in China is twice that in India, in aggregate terms. In addition, Chinese households have almost universal access to electricity, while in India almost half of rural households and 10 % of urban households still lack access. On aggregate, urban households in China also derive {{a larger share of}} their total energy from liquid fuels and grids (77 %) as compared to urban Indian households (65 %). Yet, at every income level, Indians derive a slightly larger fraction of their total household energy needs from liquid and grid sources of energy than Chinese with <b>comparable</b> <b>incomes.</b> Despite these differences, trends in energy use and the factors influencing a transition to modern energy in both nations are similar. Compared with rural households, urban households in both nations consume a disproportionately large share of commercial energy and are much further along in the transition to modern energy. However, total energy consumption in rural households exceeds that in urban households, because of a continued dependence on inefficient solid fuels, which contribute to over 85 % of rural household energy needs in both countries. In addition to urbanisation, key drivers of the transition in both nations include income, energy prices, energy access and local fuel availability...|$|R

40|$|Economic {{development}} in Latin America has trailed most other world regions {{over the past}} four decades despite its relatively high initial development and school attainment levels. This puzzle can be resolved by considering the actual learning as expressed in tests of cognitive skills, on which Latin American countries consistently perform at the bottom. In growth models estimated across world regions, these low levels of cognitive skills can account for the poor growth performance of Latin America. Given the limitations of worldwide tests in discriminating performance at low levels, we also introduce measures from two regional tests designed to measure performance for all Latin American countries with internationally <b>comparable</b> <b>income</b> data. Our growth analysis using these data confirms the significant effects of cognitive skills on intra-regional variations. Splicing the new regional tests into the worldwide tests, we also confirm this effect in extended worldwide regressions, although it appears somewhat smaller in the regional Latin American data than in the worldwide data. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{state may}} provide {{financial}} assistance {{to families with dependent}} children either by reducing their tax burden or by increasing their welfare benefits.

This paper provides an overview of financial support amounts provided {{to families with dependent children}} or families with the youngest child aged 1 to 3, and of measures limiting such support. The lower tax burden of families with children ensues from lower income tax, not from the social and health care security systems. Within this system, tax support provided to families with children is comparable to that provided to low-income families without children. Additional support provided to families with children includes tax benefits tied directly to children in the family, and tax credit for a dependent spouse.
