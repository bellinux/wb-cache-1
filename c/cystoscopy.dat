40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the status of}} the most promising tumor markers of bladder cancer, including comparison with cytology, technical complexity and utility in patient management. STUDY DESIGN: An extensive literature search was performed, and multiple markers were evaluated. The markers with the greatest potential for use as an adjunct to cytology were reviewed to {{determine the}} value of clinical implementation. Markers with a paucity of clinical research and poor results in clinical trials were omitted from review, as were genetic and cytologic prognostic determinants. RESULTS: NMP 22, bladder tumor antigen, fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products, telomerase and QUANTICYT image analysis cytometry produced the most favorable and reproducible results. Each test obtained favorable sensitivities in comparison with cytology, especially in the detection of low grade lesions. Many also retrospectively placed patients in high- and low-risk groups based on the test results, allowing increased follow-up time between <b>cystoscopies.</b> However, inability to detect some high grade lesions reduces their utility. CONCLUSION: Continued clinical trials using these and other predictors of bladder cancer will eventually find a test that is suitable, in sensitivity and specificity, for use in urology clinics. Until that time, these tests may be useful in conjunction with cytology to prolong the interval between <b>cystoscopies...</b>|$|R
25|$|Diagnosis {{can also}} be made by <b>cystoscopy,</b> where a small camera is {{inserted}} into the urethra for direct visualization of the posteriorly positioned valve.

25|$|For {{an adult}} patient with {{isolated}} hematuria, tests such as ultrasound of the kidney and <b>cystoscopy</b> are usually done first {{to pinpoint the}} source of the bleeding. These tests would rule out kidney stones and bladder cancer, two other common urological causes of hematuria. In children and younger adults, the history and association with respiratory infection can raise the suspicion of IgA nephropathy. A kidney biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. The biopsy specimen shows proliferation of the mesangium, with IgA deposits on immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. However, patients with isolated microscopic hematuria (i.e. without associated proteinuria and with normal kidney function) are not usually biopsied since this is associated with an excellent prognosis. A urinalysis will show red blood cells, usually as red cell urinary casts. Proteinuria, usually less than 2grams per day, also may be present. Other renal causes of isolated hematuria include thin basement membrane disease and Alport syndrome, the latter being a hereditary disease associated with hearing impairment and eye problems.|$|E

A recent study has suggested that the conventional frequency of bladder examinations may not be necessary and that most patients could be spared many <b>cystoscopies.</b> Instillation of cytotoxic drugs in the bladder has been shown to reduce the recurrence of tumours destroyed endoscopically and the development of new tumours elsewhere in the bladder. Because intravesical instillations are inconvenient, expensive, and may be toxic they have been reserved for patients thought to be at greatest risk of recurrence. However, two clinical trials have shown that a single cytotoxic instillation may be beneficial for low risk patients. If this is verified in everyday practice, the routine use of intravesical chemotherapy for all patients at the time of initial treatment could reduce the need for <b>cystoscopies</b> even further.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{there is}} level I {{evidence}} demonstrating {{the superiority of}} intravesical therapy in patients with bladder cancer, surveillance strategies are primarily founded on expert opinion. The authors examined compli-ance with surveillance and treatment strategies and the pursuant impact on survival in patients with high-grade dis-ease. METHODS: Using linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) -Medicare data, the authors identified subjects with a diagnosis of high-grade, non–muscle-invasive disease between 1992 and 2002 who survived 2 years and did not undergo definitive treatment during that time. Nonlinear mixed-effects regression analyses {{was used to examine}} compliance with surveillance and treatment strategies. After adjusting for confounders using a pro-pensity score-weighted approach, the authors determined whether individual and comprehensive strategies during the initial 2 years after diagnosis were associated with survival after 2 years. RESULTS: Of 4790 subjects, only 1 received all the recommended measures. Although mean utilization for most measures significantly increased after 1997, only compliance with an induction course of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) increased (13 % to 20 %; P <. 001). On multivariate analysis, compliance with 4 <b>cystoscopies,</b> 4 cytologies, and BCG instillation was found to be lower among octogenarians and higher among those with undifferentiated, Tis, and T 1 tumors, and among those indi-viduals diagnosed after 1997.

40|$|Background: More than 25 % of bladder cancer (BC) {{cases are}} still muscle-invasive at first diagnosis. Screening is {{unproven}} {{to enable the}} detection of more non-muscle-invasive tumors. BC association with aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN) was reported after intake of slimming pills containing Chinese herbs. Objective: We evaluated whether a BC screening protocol in a high-risk and unique patient population {{had an impact on}} the stage of tumor presentation. Design, setting, and participants: Forty-eight AAN-affected patients were enrolled in a screening program, establishing BC incidence during prospective screening <b>cystoscopies</b> and biopsies biannually for up to 10 yr. Two patients were lost to follow-up, and three refused screening after consenting. Measurements: Patients were evaluated for presence of BC and tumor stage at diagnosis. Results and limitations: BC was diagnosed in 25 patients (52 %). Among 43 patients who underwent screening <b>cystoscopies</b> (median follow-up: 94 mo), 22 were first diagnosed with non-muscle-invasive BC but none with muscle-invasive tumors and none died of BC. Three women who declined follow-up were diagnosed and died with advanced metastatic disease. The limitations of our findings include the small sample size of this case series, the absence of a real control group, and the particular risk factor in these patients that differs from the usual risk factors, such as smoking or industrial chemicals. Conclusions: BC screening in high-risk groups may allow identification of tumors before muscle invasion. The optimal screening schedule and the relevance of the present findings in smoking-related BC remain to be defined. © 2011 European Association of Urology.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Aristolochic acids are nephrotoxins and {{predispose}} to upper-tract urothelial carcinoma. The risk of bladder urothelial carcinoma after kidney transplantation and {{its relationship}} to upper-tract urothelial carcinoma is not well defined. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Single-center cohort of 38 women given kidney transplants for end-stage aristolochic acid nephropathy. OUTCOMES & MEASUREMENTS: The prevalence of upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma was determined by collecting pathological results of specimens obtained by means of bilateral ureteronephrectomy. We also established the cumulative incidence of bladder urothelial carcinoma in biopsies performed during prospective screening <b>cystoscopies</b> during a 15 -year follow-up. RESULTS: Upper-tract urothelial carcinoma was found in 17 patients with aristolochic acid nephropathy (44. 7 %). During follow-up, bladder urothelial carcinoma was diagnosed in 15 patients 68 to 169 months after cessation of aristolochic acid exposure (39. 5 %) : 8 urothelial carcinoma in situ, 4 noninvasive low-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma, and 3 infiltrating urothelial carcinoma. 12 of 17 patients (71 %) with a history of upper-tract urothelial carcinoma developed bladder urothelial carcinoma during follow-up, whereas this occurred in only 3 of 21 patients (14 %) without upper-tract urothelial carcinoma (P < 0. 01). Despite local and/or systemic chemotherapy, 3 patients died and 2 radical cystectomies were performed. LIMITATIONS: Small sample size of this case series. CONCLUSIONS: Upper-tract and bladder urothelial carcinoma are dramatic complications in kidney transplant recipients with aristolochic acid nephropathy, confirming the carcinogenic properties of aristolochic acids. We identified upper-tract urothelial carcinoma as a potent risk factor for the subsequent development of bladder urothelial carcinoma after kidney transplantation for aristolochic acid nephropathy. Because this complication may occur years after aristolochic acid discontinuation, we suggest regular <b>cystoscopies</b> in addition to the bilateral ureteronephrectomy in kidney transplant recipients with aristolochic acid nephropathy.
