5|$|A 2004 review {{reported}} 46% of bites occurring on distal extremities of the limbs, 25% on proximal {{areas of}} limbs (upper arms and thighs), 21% on the trunk, and 7% {{on the head}} or neck. In some cases the same spider bites a victim multiple times. Historically, victims were often bitten on the genitalia, though this phenomenon disappeared as outhouses were superseded by plumbed indoor toilets. Conversely, bites {{on the head and}} neck have increased with use of safety helmets and ear muffs. Precautions to avoid being bitten include wearing gloves and shoes while gardening, not leaving <b>clothes</b> <b>on</b> the floor, and shaking out gloves or shoes before putting them on. Also, children can be educated not to touch spiders.|$|E
5|$|A new student, Hilary van Doren, {{joins the}} school's Dance {{department}} and seduces Leroy. Bruno and Mr. Shorofsky debate {{the merits of}} traditional orchestras versus synthesized instruments. Bruno's father plays his music (the title song) outside the school, inspiring the student body to dance in the streets. As an acting exercise, the {{students are asked to}} divulge a painful memory. Montgomery discusses discovering his homosexuality, while coming out in front of his classmates; Doris relates her humiliation at being forced by her stage mother to sing at a child's birthday party; and Ralph tells of learning about the death of his idol Freddie Prinze. Miss Berg drops Lisa from the Dance program, and after seemingly considering suicide in a New York City Subway station, Lisa drops her dance <b>clothes</b> <b>on</b> the subway tracks and decides to join the Drama department.|$|E

He walks along the beach and finds a secluded spot to go swimming. A convict in women's clothing swaps his clothes with Jenks and Jenks has no choice to but to wear the discarded <b>clothes.</b> <b>On</b> his way back, Jenks answers a call for help and is mistaken for the robber. He is captured and has to explain circumstances which lead to awkward situation.

5000|$|Fitting rooms, or [...] "dressing rooms", are {{rooms where}} people try <b>on</b> <b>clothes,</b> {{such as in}} a {{department}} store. The rooms are usually individual rooms {{in which a person}} tries <b>on</b> <b>clothes</b> to determine fit before making a purchase. People do not always use the fitting rooms to change, as to change implies to remove one set of <b>clothes</b> and put <b>on</b> another. Sometimes a person chooses to try <b>on</b> <b>clothes</b> over their clothes (such as sweaters or coats), but would still like to do this in private. Thus fitting rooms may be used for changing, or just for fitting without changing.|$|R

5|$|On January 28, Khánh {{flew from}} Huế to Saigon dressed in {{civilian}} <b>clothes</b> <b>on</b> a commercial airliner. He covered for his ruse {{by claiming that}} he was travelling with United States military adviser Colonel Jasper Wilson and stating {{that he had come}} for a dental appointment. This came after Duc had arrived in I Corps earlier in the day with a message from the other plotters that Khánh was to be in Saigon to lead the coup on the day after. What Khánh had actually done was to send Wilson to Saigon earlier in the day to check with the embassy and confirm that Washington did support the coup.|$|E
5|$|American {{involvement}} in the Everglades began during the Second Seminole War (1836–42), a costly and very unpopular conflict. The United States spent between $30million and $40million and lost between 1,500 and 3,000lives. The U.S. military drove the Seminoles into the Everglades and were charged {{with the task of}} finding them, defeating them, and moving them to Oklahoma Indian territory. Almost 4,000Seminoles were killed in the war or were removed. The U.S. military was completely unprepared for the conditions they found in the Everglades. They tore their <b>clothes</b> <b>on</b> sawgrass, ruined their boots on the uneven limestone floor, and were plagued by mosquitoes. Soldiers' legs, feet, and arms were cut open on the sawgrass and gangrene infection set in, taking many lives and limbs. Many died of mosquito-borne illness. After slogging through mud, one private died in his tracks of exhaustion in 1842. General Thomas Jesup admitted the military was overwhelmed by the terrain when he wrote to the Secretary of War in 1838, trying to dissuade him from prolonging the war.|$|E
5|$|I {{remained}} on the wreck until she went down; the suction took me down some way, and a man got hold of my leg, but I managed to kick him off and came up and struck out for some pieces of wood {{that were on the}} water and started for land, about two miles off. I was in the water about five hours, as the shore was so rocky and the surf ran so high that a great many were lost trying to land. Nearly all those that took to the water without their <b>clothes</b> <b>on</b> were taken by sharks; hundreds of them were all round us, and I saw men taken by them close to me, but as I was dressed (having on a flannel shirt and trousers) they preferred the others. I was not in the least hurt, and am happy to say, kept my head clear; most of the officers lost their lives from losing their presence of mind and trying to take money with them, and from not throwing off their coats. - Letter from Lieutenant J.F. Girardot, 43rd Light Infantry, to his father, 1 March 1852.|$|E

5|$|On February 16, 2012, Rapzilla {{announced}} that Lecrae {{was preparing to}} release his first mixtape, Church <b>Clothes.</b> <b>On</b> May 3, 2012, Lecrae premiered his music video for the title track of his Church Clothes mixtape online on XXL. The video was noted for including cameos by Kendrick Lamar and DJ Premier, and attracted almost 20,000 views {{in less than a}} day. Hosted by Don Cannon, the mixtape featured the song Darkest Hour, in which Lecrae collaborated with No Malice of Clipse. Church Clothes was downloaded more than 100,000 times in less than 48 hours on DatPiff.com, and {{in less than a month}} reached 250,000 downloads, a platinum rating on the website. On June 25, 2012, a remastered version of the mixtape, without DJ Don Cannon, was released as an EP for sale on iTunes. Due to issues with sampling, this version was much shorter with only seven songs. Upon its release, the EP debuted on the Billboard charts at No. 10 on both the Christian Albums and Gospel Albums charts for the week of July 14, 2012.|$|E
5|$|Wes grabs {{a can of}} {{gasoline}} and pours a trail from the Jeep to the woods. They lure the Grizzly Bear to it and then set the gasoline on fire. The Jeep explodes, but the bear is unharmed. They decide to try another plan and split up. Wes climbs a tree, leaving his blood covered <b>clothes</b> <b>on</b> the ground to fool the Bear. While the Bear is sniffing at the clothes, Wes accidentally drops a tire iron, calling the bear's attention up. The bear shakes {{him out of the}} tree but he escapes and goes to the shack where Lauren has built a trap. They lure the bear into the shack, and use a trigger to close the front door behind it, locking it in. They celebrate and start to leave but the bear breaks out of the shack and they both try to escape. Unfortunately, Wes stumbles and Lauren tries to get him back up, refusing to leave him behind despite his desperate insistence that she should run. The Bear catches up to them and presumably kills them both.|$|E
