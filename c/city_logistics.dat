5000|$|Although {{there are}} various types of {{economic}} activity in the <b>city</b> (<b>logistics,</b> metallurgy, chemical and electrical materials, and petrochemical), Mauá is still known as the [...] "capital of china and pottery", because this activity was {{very important for the}} development of the municipality. There are two industrial centers (Capuava and Sertãozinho) and a large petrochemical complex plant where the refinery of Petrobras is located, the RECAP. These poles transformed Mauá into one of the largest industrial parks in the country. Major road interventions are being implemented (the Mário Covas Beltway and the prolongation of the Avenue Jacu-Pêssego/Nova Trabalhadores), which, due to the improved access to the city should influence the growth of industrial activity, who nowadays suffers with the bottleneck of the road network and its chronic lack of maintenance.|$|E
40|$|Urban freight {{transport}} {{has become an}} essential issue in urban planning. There are many challenges and problems relating to increasing levels of traffic congestion, negative environmental impacts and energy consumption. To cope with these complicated problems, new <b>city</b> <b>logistics</b> schemes are required that are aimed at increasing the efficiency of urban {{freight transport}} systems as well as reducing traffic congestion and impacts on the environment. Recent developments in ICT (Information and Communication Technology) and ITS (Intelligent Transport Systems) help tackle these difficult problems. As well, the corporate social responsibility of shippers and freight carriers promotes public-private partnerships in urban freight transport planning. This book, "Recent Advances in City Logistics", is an outcome of the Fourth International Conference on <b>City</b> <b>Logistics</b> (<b>City</b> <b>Logistics</b> IV held in Langkawi in 2005) organised by the Institute for <b>City</b> <b>Logistics.</b> It includes recent developments in the modelling, evaluation and planning of <b>city</b> <b>logistics</b> schemes.

As well, an overview of the data collection for modelling, evaluating and benchmarking <b>city</b> <b>logistics</b> schemes and intermodal freight transport for <b>city</b> <b>logistics</b> is given.

40|$|AbstractEfficiency of <b>city</b> <b>logistics</b> {{activities}} suffers due to conflicting personal {{preferences and}} distributed decision making by multiple <b>city</b> <b>logistics</b> stakeholders. This {{is exacerbated by}} interdependency of <b>city</b> <b>logistics</b> activities, decision making with limited information and stakeholders’ preference for personal objectives over system efficiency. Accordingly, {{the key to understanding}} the causes of inefficiency in the <b>city</b> <b>logistics</b> domain is understanding the interaction between heterogeneous stakeholders of the system. With the capabilities of representing a system in a natural and flexible way, agent based modelling (ABM) is a promising alternative for the <b>city</b> <b>logistics</b> domain. This research focuses on developing a framework for the successful implementation of the ABM approach for the <b>city</b> <b>logistics</b> domain. The framework includes various elements – a multi-perspective semantic data model (i. e. ontology) and its validation, the development of an agent base model using this ontology, and a validation approach for the agent-based model.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the emergence of}} <b>logistics</b> <b>cities,</b> which are geographical concentrations of related industries situated around one or more international trade gateways adjacent to a metropolitan area. Broadly, a <b>logistics</b> <b>city</b> comprises <b>logistics</b> activities and related assets combined with an integrated mix of manufacturing and assembly companies, business services, retail outlets, research and education centres, and associated government services and administration sections. This concept is currently being promoted and developed globally by several regions, and examples of these <b>logistics</b> <b>cities</b> are described in this paper. Drawing from these examples and the limited available literature, a preliminary conceptual map of the <b>logistics</b> <b>cities</b> concept has been developed which incorporates a theoretical foundation of economic development and the principles of competitiveness {{in the notion of}} trade clusters. This map has provided the basis for our further investigations and the continued development of a more detailed conceptual model that will provide a systematic knowledge base for those engaged in the development of further <b>logistics</b> <b>cities.</b> The beneficiaries of this model will be public authorities, property developers and industrial concerns, and will be used when making decisions for future logistics infrastructure, services, supporting services and related social elements. ...|$|R

40|$|PurposeThe {{purpose is}} to provide a {{structured}} method for prioritising among the diversity of motives and goals of stakeholders involved in <b>city</b> <b>logistics.</b> Design/methodology/approachThe paper is based on a three-year participant observation study in a <b>city</b> <b>logistics</b> project including ten stakeholders. The data relate to the understanding gained during the three years of study and nine semi-structured interviews with the stakeholders dedicated to the purpose of this paper. The data are analysed with a multi-criteria decision model, which utilises the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to rank alternative motives and their importance in a stakeholder value matrix. FindingsThe AHP and the stakeholder value matrix provide a structured approach to manage the multiple stakeholders in <b>city</b> <b>logistics</b> and their motives (values). The approach provide the possibility to identify which overall values that need the most attention and which and to what extent values need to be considered for each stakeholder. Research limitations/implicationsThe structured method is applicable to other <b>city</b> <b>logistics</b> projects. The specific insights from the long-term <b>city</b> <b>logistics</b> project in this paper provide inspiration to future <b>city</b> <b>logistics</b> projects about how to manage stakeholders and their motives over time.

In this paper {{we focus on the}} ex ante sustainability assessment of <b>city</b> <b>logistics</b> solutions. For demonstration purposes, we rely on a simple fictitious city and investigate the implementation of alternative logistics pooling solutions. Using sustainability key performance indices, we contrast a centralized pooling solution relying on a single Urban Consolidation Center (UCC) with an interlinked pooling solution rather relying on a network of distributed UCCs. Key learnings are (1) the importance of rigorous ex ante sustainability assessment of proposed <b>city</b> <b>logistics</b> solutions, as the assessment investigated solutions revealed counterintuitive results, and (2) the importance of designing <b>city</b> <b>logistics</b> solution using an open interconnected systemic approach rather than a piecemeal approach, as a fundamental root cause of the results with the proposed alternative solutions was revealed by contrasting the foundations of their design to those inherent interconnected <b>city</b> <b>logistics</b> as prescribed according to the Physical Internet concept.
