500|$|In San Diego, Konnan met John Roberts. Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter then details Ashenoff's {{first foray}} in to {{professional}} wrestling: [...] "Carlos traveled to Tijuana on Wednesday, January 6, 1988, (his 24th birthday), {{where he was}} led to the dressing area and introduced to Manuel de los Santos, the promoter of the show, and who also wrestled in the main event as “Kiss.” De los Santos {{took one look at}} the 215-pound bodybuilder and did the classic double-take –– what the hell is this guy doing here, and, how quickly <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> this guy in the ring. Konnan introduced himself and explained how he was brought here by his manager/agent, John Roberts. Roberts had already bragged to de los Santos that Carlos had been a wrestler in Florida. Suddenly, a big roar (laughter) went up from another wrestler, Miguel Lopez, who wrestled as Rey Mysterio. Lopez/Mysterio explained to Carlos that Roberts was just a nutty fan, always in the front row, but that he did nothing involved with managing or agent-ing or anything else in the business. Still, the wrestlers asked Carlos, want to give it a try?" [...] Billed as El Centurión ("The Centurion"), Ashenoff debuted for the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA) on January 6, 1988.|$|E

2500|$|HIT {{dismissed}} {{claims that}} workers were being paid less {{now than they}} were in 1997. [...] "It's also wrong that their pay is now lower than in 1997 or during SARS," [...] HIT general manager Gerry Yim Lui-fai told the South China Morning Post. Several long-serving stevedores working for Lem Wing Transportation and Everbest dismissed the strikers' claims as exaggeration. A 7-year veteran crane driver said [...] "It's not that we can't go to the toilet or don't have time for a meal... In fact, we have short breaks of two to three minutes between vessels berthing at the terminals. Very rarely <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> 15 to 30 minutes. We also take turns to have meals so that we have around 15 to 20 minutes for mealtimes." [...] He said that he enjoyed a pay increase in 2011. Two Everbest employees said that, by working as a pair and managing their time during a 24-hour shift, they can alternate and work six or twelve hours. They said they took home HK$1,315 and HK$1,441, (between US$170 and $185) per shift, averaging HK$20,000 ($2,560) per month. They also said that some of their colleagues wanted to return to work, but were worried they would be chastised as spineless.|$|E
