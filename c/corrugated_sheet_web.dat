40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} is to analyze {{the performance of the}} Laminar Heat Pipe Heat Exchanger. The test samples were divided two groups, one is the metal <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheet</b> with heat pipe, and the other is the metal <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheet</b> only. By dipping these two group samples into hot water and to see the thermal image by Infrared thermal imager. The results shown the temperature risen of the sheet with heat pipe was faster than that of the sheet without heat pipe. In addition, the bigger of the temperature difference between hot water temperature and ambient temperature, the quicker of the temperature risen for the metal <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheet,</b> and the temperature of the metal <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheet</b> were homogenous as well. For example, when the water temperature is 30 ℃, ambient temperature is 20 ℃, the metal <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheet</b> with heat pipe rise rapidly to 26 ℃ within 1 minute, while the metal <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheet</b> without heat pipe rise to 22 ℃ only, this temperature difference would be more obvious with the increasing of the hot water temperature. When the hot water temperature is up to 40 ℃, the metal <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheet</b> with heat pipe rise rapidly to 31 ℃ within 1 minute, while the metal <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheet</b> without het pipe is still rise up to 22 ℃ only. When the hot water temperature is up to 50 ℃, The metal <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheet</b> with heat pipe rise rapidly to 33 ℃ within 1 minute, while the sheet without heat pipe still keep at 22 ℃, the results shown the heat pipe affect the temperature rising speed is obvious, and it also implying heat pipe is a very important parameter for the heat transfer rate of the Laminar Heat Pipe Heat Exchanger...|$|R
40|$|Modelling of the hydrodynamics {{behaviour}} of {{the liquid}} on the <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheets</b> of packing is studied using three-dimensional, volume-of-fluid (VOF) model that is incorporated in Ansys Fluent 12. 0. The flow of three different liquids with different physical properties is modelled. A domain of <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheets</b> of packing resembling the real structured packing with little modifications in the elementary geometry is constructed using ICEM CFD 12. 0. The quantitative comparisons of the wetting behavior from the simulations are in good agreement with experiments. Further, the study has been extended to understand {{the influence of the}} second <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheet</b> on the flow behavior. The contours from the simulations indicate the liquid hold-up in the crimp of two <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheets,</b> and these results are in good agreement with the earlier experimental studies performed using X-ray tomography in the literature. The result from the simulation shows that even for the high flow rate of around 811 [*]mL/min for silicon-oil (DC 5), only 60 % of the <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheet</b> has been wetted. Hence, the efficiency of the existing packing can be further increased by increasing the wetted area in the <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheet</b> of packing...|$|R

Four different individual housing for calves covered with asbestos-free fiber-cement <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheets</b> were evaluated.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{performance}} of fiber-cement <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheets</b> exposed to long-term weathering, exploring the effect of different environments on fiber-cement degradation. Fiber-cement <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheets</b> that {{had been exposed to}} weathering, and in place for more than 30 -years, were collected from two different Brazilian cities (Sao Paulo and Criciuma). Mechanical properties (MOR, MOE and fracture toughness) were tested on samples removed from the <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheets.</b> Microstructure was evaluated by X-ray diffraction, SEM with EDS analysis, MIP and TG. The results show that the 37 -year-old asbestos-cement <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheets</b> from Sao Paulo presented similar characteristics to those of the non-aged asbestos-cement readily available on the market place. Conversely, deterioration of the asbestos-cement from the industrial area of Criciuma is related to acidic attack, along with carbonation and leaching as a consequence of continued exposition to acid rain during several decades. This process resulted in higher porosity and lower mechanical strength, revealing that leaching mechanisms can have important effect on {{the performance of}} thin fiber-cement sheets.
