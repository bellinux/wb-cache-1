30|$|To {{assess the}} effect of the work {{schedule}} on worker productivity, I estimate Mincerian-like hourly wage regressions. Although wages may deviate from the worker’s current productivity (e.g., see Manning 2010), the lack of a <b>compensatory</b> <b>premium</b> for working split shifts (Amuedo-Dorantes and de la Rica 2009) plus the rich set of controls (discussed in Sect.  2.2) included in the wage regressions, strongly suggest that the existence of wage differences across work schedules reflects, at least in part, differences in productivity. Following Bell and Hart (1999) and Anger (2008), I explore two different measures of the hourly wage to account for possible differences in unpaid work across work schedules. The first measure (WM 1) is calculated as average net monthly earnings divided by HM 1 times 4.3. 6 The second measure (WM 2) has as denominator HM 2 times 4.3. According to Bell and Hart (1999), WM 1 is a superior measure of productivity because actual wages are adjusted between high- and low-productivity workers by requiring the latter to undertake unpaid overtime. However, if unpaid overtime is used in fact by workers to signal a higher value to the firm (Anger 2008), WM 2 would be preferred.|$|E
30|$|The {{application}} of E.C. Reg. 1782 / 2003 {{at the beginning}} of 2005 brought a new era in the sector. Full decoupling has been imposed by the Greek government for the sheep and goat sector as it was for most of the Greek agriculture sectors, which meant that production-oriented subsidies would have been paid on a 'historic rights' basis, i.e. a comprehensive subsidy was calculated {{on the basis of the}} unitary 2002 headage payment and the farmer's payment rights (calculated as the average of 3 years) and the amount 'frozen' until 2013. This was expected to have positive impacts by favouring the replacement of specialised crop systems with mixed crop and livestock systems and by returning non-profitable arable land to pasture lands. Sheep and goat farmers who had grazing land in their 'historic records' had to maintain these lands in good condition by grazing (maintaining a density of 1.4 head/ha), while the landless farmers, who used to use 'communal grazing land', had to continue breeding at least 50 % of their animals. The <b>compensatory</b> <b>premium</b> for breeding in the LFAs continued largely unaffected, while some agri-environmental measures (these including extensification and organic farming) were applied sporadically. The implementation of 'cross compliance' rules did not result in many constraints for sheep and goat farmers, except for the animal identification rules, since many traditional farmers were reluctant to enter the system and keep records.|$|E
