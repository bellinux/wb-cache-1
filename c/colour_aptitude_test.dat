40|$|Abstract: <b>Aptitude</b> <b>tests</b> analyse the <b>aptitude</b> {{of persons}} for {{studying}} {{at a specific}} school or university {{as well as for}} working within a specific company. Due to the recent technology advances, web-based solutions are increasingly used for the implementation of <b>aptitude</b> <b>tests.</b> These web-based <b>aptitude</b> <b>tests</b> can be utilised for rather standardized test methods, testing a large amount of users. Based on the fact that web-based <b>aptitude</b> <b>tests</b> are getting more and more common, a high user acceptance is important, especially since test results tend to be taken more seriously. Furthermore, the design of the test should be helpful and support the use of the test. In this context, the target of our research is to provide a framework for the evaluation of the user acceptance for web-based <b>aptitude</b> <b>tests.</b> The research method is based on an exemplary web-based <b>aptitude</b> <b>test</b> and includes the following steps: Firstly, we used the Dynamic Acceptance Model for the Re-evaluation of Technologies (DART) as a basis for the adoption of web-based <b>aptitude</b> <b>tests.</b> DART is an instrument designed for the analysis and evaluation of the user acceptance of innovative technologies, products or services. Based on a literature review and expert interviews, we identified the most important acceptance indicators. In a next step, we evaluated the defined acceptance indicators in a survey with test persons who carried out one selected web-based <b>aptitude</b> <b>test.</b> Afterwards, we analysed {{the reliability and validity of}} the developed evaluation framework. The result shows that a detailed analysis of the influencing factors is generally possible with the use of DART. This approach helps to define a balanced set of measurable acceptance indicators for the evaluation of the user acceptance. Finally, we described lessons learned and the ongoing process to measure the acceptance of web-based <b>aptitude</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R
30|$|Overall, {{the results}} {{indicate}} that <b>aptitude</b> <b>tests</b> work best both for natives and immigrants, irrespective of the timing of treatment. When applied early during the welfare spell, skill provision is helpful for welfare recipients, too. Job search training and combined training programs are rather ineffective. <b>Aptitude</b> <b>tests</b> and skill provision are programs that have a direct focus on employment uptake. They aim at increasing qualifications demanded by the labor market. <b>Aptitude</b> <b>tests,</b> for example, include the screening of participants’ potential to work in occupations looked for by employers and the teaching of skills relevant in these occupations. Therefore, <b>aptitude</b> <b>tests</b> improve the matching quality between participants and open jobs. Skill provision also aims at increasing qualifications demanded by employers. However, the focus of skill provision is more general than in the case of <b>aptitude</b> <b>tests.</b> It involves mainly qualifications that are not occupation-specific but are basic requirements for employment uptake in many occupations (e.g. computer courses). In contrast to <b>aptitude</b> <b>tests</b> and skill provision, job search training does not provide a direct path to employment. It {{can be seen as a}} preparatory program for employment uptake. The program helps to get in touch with employers, but does not provide specific skills required by them. This might explain the disappointing employment effects of this program. A combination of job search training with skill provision or <b>aptitude</b> <b>tests</b> might be more effective.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the effectiveness of}} quantitative and non-quantitative majors in preparing students for screening tests routinely used in the job recruitment process. A sample of 209 students from Bryn Mawr and Haverford Colleges completed an online survey that consisted of a 17 -minute <b>aptitude</b> <b>test</b> comprising of verbal, logical and numerical reasoning sections, and demographic survey questions. Logistic regression analysis confirms that the primary determinant of students' college major choice is academic interests. Other significant factors include students' self-perceived ability and SAT math scores. When considering the middle-range <b>aptitude</b> <b>test</b> scores, I found compelling evidence that most upperclassmen in quantitative majors perform better in the job <b>aptitude</b> <b>test</b> than other participants. This effect shows that quantitative majors provide average students with a nurturing learning experience and are effective in preparing average students for the transition from college to the workforce. The strong association between SAT scores and job <b>aptitude</b> <b>test</b> also reveals that better <b>aptitude</b> <b>test</b> performance {{may be attributed to}} well-develop test-taking skills...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the {{relationship}} between individual <b>aptitude</b> <b>tests</b> score results and actual job performance, as measured in selected Harare companies. The rationale for the study was based on the observation that some people who do well on the job but have not necessarily passed psychometric tests, also experience has shown that candidates fail psychometric test when they have excellent reference letters from previous employers. The significance of this study was to enable selected Harare companies to have an insight into the relationship between psychometric tests and job performance as a way of informing their recruitment policies. There are no studies to the researcherâ€™s knowledge that have been carried out in Zimbabwe on <b>aptitude</b> <b>test</b> as a valid predictor of job performance. Also the previous studies did not focus much on <b>aptitude</b> <b>tests.</b> This study was quantitative in nature and the simple random sampling technique was used. The researcher obtained the performance rating score of employees who took part in the research from their respective companies through the help of Industrial Psychology Consultants, the <b>aptitude</b> <b>tests</b> score results were obtained from Industrial Psychology Consultants since they are the tests administrators. Individual <b>test</b> scores on <b>aptitude</b> <b>tests</b> where correlated with performance rating scores. The major finding of this investigation was that all three subtests of differential <b>aptitude</b> <b>tests</b> namely verbal reasoning, numerical reasoning, and abstract reasoning correlated positively with job performance. A moderate correlation r 0. 39 between <b>aptitude</b> <b>tests</b> and job performance was found leading to the rejection of all the null hypothesis.

40|$|School {{entrance}} examinations are both an incentive system to motivate {{students and a}} screening device to identify students with the most potential. To maximize incentives to acquire knowledge, exams should only reward achievement. But to identify the most able students, exams should also reward aptitude. Using a model in which schools are interested in both aptitude and achievement, we show how competition between schools leads each school to put more emphasis on <b>aptitude</b> <b>tests</b> which perform a primarily screening role, and less emphasis on achievement tests and grades which provide incentives for learning. This result is broadly consistent with the comparative reliance on <b>aptitude</b> <b>tests</b> in the United States relative to countries with more centralized education systems.
