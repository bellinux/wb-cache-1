Spores of C. novyi escape from the gut and lodge in the liver, where they remain dormant until some injury creates anaerobic conditions for them to germinate, causing local necrosis and widespread damage to the microvascular system, resulting in subcutaneous bleeding and blackening of the skin, hence the common name [...] "black disease." ...|$|E
40|$|Since 2000 in the United Kingdom, infections {{caused by}} spore-forming {{bacteria}} {{have been associated}} with increasing illness and death among persons who inject drugs (PWID). To assess temporal and geographic trends in these illnesses (botulism, tetanus, <b>Clostridium</b> <b>novyi</b> <b>infection,</b> and anthrax), we compared rates across England and Scotland for 2000 - 2009. Overall, 295 infections were reported: 1. 45 per 1, 000 PWID in England and 4. 01 per 1, 000 PWID in Scotland. The higher rate in Scotland was mainly attributable to C. novyi infection and anthrax; rates of botulism and tetanus were comparable in both countries. The temporal and geographic clustering of cases of C. novyi and anthrax into outbreaks suggests possible contamination of specific heroin batches; in contrast, the more sporadic nature of tetanus and botulism cases suggests that these spores might more commonly exist in the drug supply or local environment although at varying levels.

The enzymes of <b>Clostridium</b> <b>novyi</b> and Bacillus cereus attacked all the membranes and their lipid extracts, hydrolyzing phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, lyso-phosphatidylethanolamine, and o-aminoacylphosphatidylglycerol. Phospholipase C from Pseudomonas aureofaciens attacked these three membranes and their lipid extracts, hydrolyzing phosphatidylethanolamine. Phospholipase C from Clostridium perfringens hardly attacked the phospholipids of these bacterial membranes. However, phospholipase C from Clostridium perfringens hydrolyzed phosphatidylethanolamine in a mixture containing lipid extract from Escherichia coli membrane and purified phosphatidylcholine from egg yolk. Phospholipases C [EC 3. 1. 4. 3] obtained from Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens have been used to investigate the structure and function of biological membranes (1 - 4).

Three sets of primers were used to produce amplicons of 159, 836 and 959 base pairs (bp), respectively. The PCR was evaluated by testing clinically important strains of Clostridium, including 21 strains of C. chauvoei, five strains each of Clostridium septicum and Clostridium perfringens and two strains each of <b>Clostridium</b> <b>novyi,</b> <b>Clostridium</b> histolyticum and Clostridium sordellii.

In addition, extracts of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues of eight sheep experimentally inoculated with C. chauvoei or C septicum (four animals each) were also tested by the PCR using the three sets of primers. Purified DNA template of all C. chauvoei strains produced PCR amplicons of the expected size for all three primer pairs. However, when biomass from pure cultures of C. chauvoei or tissue extracts were used as templates, only the primer pair designed to produce the 159 bp amplicon gave consistently positive results. No positive results were obtained with any primer pair when purified DNA or biomass from pure cultures of non-target clostridial species were used as templates.

Further characterization of the enzymatically active fragment α 551 revealed a substrate specificity for both UDP–N-acetylglucosamine and UDP-glucose. A Michaelis-Menten constant of 17 μM was determined for the substrate UDP–N-acetylglucosamine, while that for UDP-glucose was about 20 times higher, indicating a weaker affinity of the toxin for the latter substrate. Mutation of the aspartic acids of a conserved motif DXD within α 551 reduced enzyme activity > 700 -fold and inhibited cytotoxicity after microinjection in cells. Inhibition of enzyme activity of the DXD mutant could be partially overcome by increased concentrations of manganese ions, suggesting the involvement of these aspartic acids in Mn 2 + binding.
