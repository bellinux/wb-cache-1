50|$|If {{a patient}} {{needs to be}} treated with surgery, a {{standard}} surgical procedure would be called for; the patient would be resting in Fowler’s position, a semi-sitting position, under general anesthesia. The exact size, shape, and distance between the acromion to the midpoint of the cyst are measured by a digital radiograph or MRI scan. A small, longitudinal skin incision, about 1 cm long, is made {{at the center of the}} cyst. Next, by using a trephine or drill bit, a small aperture is made inside the incision. Fluids contained in the cyst are drained and curved, metal impactors are used to break any septa, or membranes, within the cyst. Curettes are then used to remove the entire cyst from the diaphysis. After the removal of the cystic membrane, a 95% ethanol solution is injected into the cavity to produce a chemical cauterization to burn away any residual active membrane for 30 seconds and then aspirated. Saline solution is then immediately injected into the cavity to wash out any residual ethanol solution and to mitigate any damage to healthy tissue; this irrigation process of ethanol and saline solutions is repeated for another 2 to 3 times. A curved impactor is inserted into the cavity and used to penetrate the boundary between the cyst and bone marrow; the intentional penetrations will allow bone marrow cells to migrate into the cavity to produce a source of osteoinductive cells, cells that induce bony growth. Furthermore, the cavity is completely filled with bone graft substitute, such as calcium sulfate. Finally, one <b>cannulated</b> <b>screw</b> is placed into the aperture.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Removal {{of metal}} {{implants}} {{is a common}} procedure that is performed {{for a variety of}} indications. However, problems such as a buried screw head may occasionally arise and render hardware removal difficult or even impossible. The problem is further compounded when the initial screw was inserted percutaneously or via a minimally-invasive (MIS) technique. In the present paper, we introduce a novel, minimally invasive technique to remove buried <b>cannulated</b> <b>screws</b> which obviates the need for excessive extension of the skin incision, surgical exploration, soft tissue dissection or excess bone removal, which surgeons may otherwise have to undertake to uncover the buried screw head.

This study examined the feasibility, accuracy, and efficiency of treating the fracture through a three-dimensional (3 D) -printed navigation template {{that was used to}} guide placement of <b>cannulated</b> <b>screws</b> and locking compression-pediatric hip plates (LC-PHPs). Materials and Methods: Template-guided surgeries were carried out on nine children with femoral neck fracture from 1, 2012 to 12, 2014, and the resulting data were analyzed retrospectively. From preoperative computed tomography data, a 3 D model of the proximal femur and a matching navigation template were created for guiding placement of <b>cannulated</b> <b>screws</b> or LC-PHP. Finally, the template-guided operation was performed, and the outcomes were compared to those from control patients undergoing the same surgery without navigation templates (n = 10). Results: The navigation templates were found to match the individual proximal femurs well. Two to three screws were accurately inserted in the femoral neck, {{and the end of the}} fracture was successfully stabilized. Implantation of the <b>cannulated</b> <b>screws</b> or LC-PHP took an average of 13. 6 and 24. 5 min, respectively, whereas intraoperative X-ray was used an average of 4. 2 times for the former and 5. 5 times for the latter. This was compared to 37. 6 and 59. 6 min, and 11. 4 and 15. 4 X-rays, for the controls. Postoperative X-ray showed a great reduction of the femoral neck fracture. Six- to twelve-month follow-ups indicated that the fracture had healed and the function of hip joint was excellent for seven of the children and good for two (Ratliff′s criteria).

40|$|Background: Proximal femoral {{fractures}} {{account for}} 25 % of all femoral fractures in dogs {{and are more}} common in young animals. Osteosynthesis of femoral head and neck fractures is a complex procedure that can be performed using conventional screws or wires. However, proper fracture reduction and fi xation are diffi cult to achieve and, despite many advancements, such fractures remain challenging to solve. <b>Cannulated</b> <b>screws</b> have good compressive capacity and can be employed to simplify the surgical procedure while optimizing outcomes. This {{study was designed to}} compare the resistance of conventional and <b>cannulated</b> <b>screws</b> to axial loading following experimental femoral neck fracture in dogs. Materials, Methods & Results: Fourteen cadaveric canine femurs were used in this study. Femurs were collected from dogs over 20 pounds in body weight with no gross or radiographic signs of orthopedic disease. Cadaveric femurs were submitted to experimental femoral neck fracture using a Gigli saw and allocated to osteosynthesis using either conventional or <b>cannulated</b> <b>screws</b> (seven bones each). All screws were inserted below the greater trochanter of the femur from the lateral aspect of the bone and screw topography confi rmed radiographically. Test specimens were then potted in polymethylmethacrylate, coupled to a hinged device and submitted to axial loading. Data on maximum load, maximum displacement, load within the proportional limit, offset within the proportional limit and load required to produce a 3 mm displacement were collected. Mean values were calculated and compared using the Student’s t test (P < 0. 05). Mean values varied greatly within groups. Maximum load and displacement correspond to the critical point from which biomechanical testing becomes destructive. Data were missing from one test specimen (conventional screw group) due to abrupt diaphyseal fracture {{at the start of the}} axial loading trial. Discussion: The canine femur was selected as an experimentalmodel in this project due to the high incidence of femoral neck fractures in dogs. Also, studies on proximal femoral fracture osteosynthesis using <b>cannulated</b> <b>screws</b> are scarce. The effectiveness of the compression osteosynthesis technique employed in this trial has been confi rmed in several canine proximal femoral fracture studies, with reported success rates between 2 and 21 %. Success rate variability could be due to substantial individual differences, as suggested by the large intragroup variation in this trial. The biomechanical behaviour of conventional sliding hip <b>screws</b> (SHC) and <b>cannulated</b> <b>screws</b> following experimental femoral neck fracture osteosynthesis was compared. Increased stiffness was achieved with SHCs, possibly due to more effi cient transmission of compressive forces to cortical bone under the plate. Compression screws act by transmitting compressive forces to cancellous bone under the fracture line. Replication of this scenario in this trial supports the recommendation that the lowest screw be inserted as close as possible to the medial cortex of the femur, which is stiffer than the cancellous bone in the femoral head. Under the conditions studied, mean maximum load values were higher when bone screws were inserted closer to the medial cortex of the femoral shaft and the proximal aspect of the femoral head, regardless of screw type. The opposite scenario was also observed (i. e. the farther from the medial cortex of the femoral shaft, the lower the mean maximum load). In this trial, conventional and <b>cannulated</b> <b>screws</b> were equally resistant to axial loading. However, femoral neck fracture osteosynthesis using <b>cannulated</b> <b>screws</b> was easier to perfor...|$|R

The implant in our case was placed as per the recommendation [12]. The fracture itself was anatomically reduced.|$|R
30|$|In group A patients, closed {{reduction}} and internal fixation with <b>cannulated</b> <b>screws</b> was done; screws were placed within 3  mm of the femoral neck cortex according to Lindequist and Tornkvist [9]. In group B, a cemented femoral prosthesis was inserted. In all group B patients, a posterolateral approach was used [10]. All patients received perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis with second-generation cephalosporin and anticoagulation prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin.|$|R
30|$|The {{rationale}} behind temporary growth modulation for lower limb angular deformity {{is to allow}} for gradual correction while the physis is still growing and avoid the need for invasive osteotomy. Excellent results have been reported {{with the use of}} TBPs; however, fractures of the <b>cannulated</b> <b>screws</b> have been reported, mainly in obese patients with Blount disease [5, 9, 10, 11].|$|R
