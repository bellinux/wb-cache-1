40|$|Price Levels on the Internet have {{attracted}} {{a lot of}} research and managerial attention. Similar to initial predictions that Internet would lead to lower prices, empirical research shows that online prices are lower than conventional stores. There have been few studies comparing price levels at online and offline retailer, but not much is known about how prices compare among pure play e-retailers and bricks and clicks (multichannel) retailers. This research addresses this important issue through an analysis of price levels in the Mp 3 player market among two types of retailers in UK. The result in this study, based on analysis of 212 different retailers, shows that when prices both excluding <b>delivery</b> <b>charges</b> <b>and</b> including <b>delivery</b> <b>charges</b> are considered bricks and clicks retailers have high prices than pure-play e-retailers. Additionally, this study finds that Price level is positively related {{to the quality of the}} Mp 3 player. This study also finds that as number of sellers for a particular Mp 3 player increases, price (excluding <b>and</b> including <b>delivery</b> <b>charges)</b> increases. Thus contradicting the general phenomenon that increase in number of seller will intensify competition and ultimately decrease the prices of a particular product...|$|R

Its conclusion was that such a car would be technically feasible (subject to engineering changes), {{and that it would be}} financially viable. The announcement of a limited production run of 220 to 350 cars came on 20 December 1989. The list price on 1 January 1990 was £290,000 exclusive of value added tax, options <b>and</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>charges,</b> but by 1992 that had increased considerably owing to indexation of contracts.

40|$|A {{key feature}} of water policy reform in Australia {{has been the}} {{separation}} of water access entitlements from land titles {{and the establishment of}} markets for water. However, the separation of water entitlements from land failed to account for a number of characteristics that were implicit in the joint right. This has given rise to a number of third party effects as water is traded in an incomplete market. This paper describes four third-party effects of water trade; reliability of supply, timeliness of <b>delivery,</b> storage <b>and</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>charges,</b> <b>and</b> water quality and examines policy responses to address these effects. The discussion draws on the concepts of exclusiveness and rivalry to determine the applicability of property rights and other solutions to the third-party effects of trade. It is likely that many of the third-party effects of trade discussed in this paper do not warrant policy intervention at the national or state level, but intervention at the local level may be warranted. The costs of addressing some third-party effects may outweigh the benefits. Where there are significant gains from trade, the existence of these third-party effects should not been seen as a reason to impede trade.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a method {{which was used}} to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of three different ways of supplying periodical articles in an academic library. The methods considered were: subscribing to a periodical title (ownership); individual article supply provided by two electronic document delivery services, ArticlesFirst of OCLC FirstSearch and UnCover; and traditional article supply through the British Library Document Supply Centre. The operational costs of the alternatives are obtained by taking a management accounting approach and are examined in relation to the provision of the services within the library of St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, Ireland. The cost-per-use of owning a periodical title is calculated based on the operational costs of the Periodicals Department of the library, its subscription price and a lifetime use determined by examination of the current requests for articles made through the library's Inter-Library Loans Department. The cost-per-use for the other services are also calculated based on their operational costs <b>and</b> document <b>delivery</b> <b>charges...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{dielectric}} elastomer generator (DEG) can be {{used for}} converting mechanical energy from natural motion sources such as walking, waves, trees etc, into electrical energy. A DEG is comprised of a soft and flexible Dielectric Elastomer capacitor (DE), a Priming Circuit (PC), which transfers high potential charge onto/off the DE electrodes, and a power extraction circuit which harvests the generated power. To generate power, the PC must charge and discharge the DE in synchronization with the DE's capacitance change. A simple circuit to do this exists: the self-priming circuit (SPC). The SPC consists of diodes and capacitors which passively switch between <b>charge</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>and</b> <b>charge</b> receiving states in synchronization with the DE's capacitance change. Until now there has been no understanding of how to design a SPC in order to maximize harvested energy from the dielectric elastomer (DE).
