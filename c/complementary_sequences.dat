5|$|Morpholinos are {{synthetic}} {{molecules that}} {{are the product of}} a redesign of natural nucleic acid structure. Usually 25 bases in length, they bind to <b>complementary</b> <b>sequences</b> of RNA or single-stranded DNA by standard nucleic acid base-pairing. In terms of structure, the difference between Morpholinos and DNA is that, while Morpholinos have standard nucleic acid bases, those bases are bound to morpholine rings linked through phosphorodiamidate groups instead of phosphates. The figure compares the structures of the two strands depicted there, one of RNA and the other of a Morpholino. Replacement of anionic phosphates with the uncharged phosphorodiamidate groups eliminates ionization in the usual physiological pH range, so Morpholinos in organisms or cells are uncharged molecules. The entire backbone of a Morpholino is made from these modified subunits.|$|E

Several mechanisms have been proposed. ES cell-specific microRNA molecules (such as miR-291, miR-294 and miR-295) enhance the efficiency of induced pluripotency by acting downstream of c-Myc. microRNAs can also block expression of repressors of Yamanaka’s four transcription factors, and there may be additional mechanisms induce reprogramming even in the absence of added exogenous transcription factors.|$|E

40|$|New {{construction}} {{methods of}} quaternary periodic <b>complementary</b> <b>sequence</b> sets. (English summary) Adv. Math. Commun. 4 (2010), no. 1, 61 – 68. After M. J. E. Golay introduced {{the notion of}} a <b>complementary</b> <b>sequence</b> set regarding aperiodic autocorrelation functions, the notion of periodic <b>complementary</b> <b>sequence</b> (PCS) sets was introduced by L Bömer and M. Antweiler. A set of M q-ary sequences with period N is called a PCS set if the sum of all periodic autocorrelation functions assumes zero at all off-phase values. This paper offers two new construction methods to manufacture quaternary PCS sets, starting with a binary PCS set with even period. The key technique is the employment of the Gray mapping, where (r, s) is mapped to 0, 1, 2, 3 according as (r, s) is (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 0) respectively. Reviewed by Man Keung Si...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe have {{developed}} a novel gene detection method based on the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reaction and the DNA dissociation reaction on the same DNA chip surface to achieve a lower detection limit, broader dynamic range and faster detection time than are attainable with a conventional DNA chip. Both FAM- and thiol-labeled DNA probe bound to the <b>complementary</b> <b>sequence</b> accompanying Dabcyl was immobilized on the gold surface via Au/thiol bond. The LAMP reaction was carried out on the DNA probe fixed gold surface. At first, Dabcyl molecules quenched the FAM fluorescence. According to the LAMP reaction, the <b>complementary</b> <b>sequence</b> with Dabcyl was competitively reacted with the amplified targeted sequence. As a result, the FAM fluorescence increased owing to dissociation of the <b>complementary</b> <b>sequence</b> from the DNA probe. The simultaneous reaction of LAMP and DNA chip detection was achieved, and 103 copies of the targeted gene were detected within an hour by measuring fluorescence intensity of the DNA probe...|$|R
