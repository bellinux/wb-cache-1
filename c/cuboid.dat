5|$|Temple {{structures}} were built on foundations of stone slabs set into sand-filled trenches. Walls and other {{structures were}} built with large blocks of varying shapes. The blocks were laid in courses, usually without mortar. Each stone was dressed to fit with its neighbors, producing <b>cuboid</b> blocks whose uneven shapes interlocked. The interiors of walls were often built with less care, using rougher, poorer-quality stones. To build structures above ground level, the workers used construction ramps. When cutting chambers in living rock, workers excavated {{from the top}} down, carving a crawlspace near the ceiling and cutting down to the floor. Once the temple structure was complete, the rough faces of the stones were dressed to create a smooth surface. In decorating these surfaces, reliefs were carved into the stone or, if the stone was of too poor quality to carve, a layer of plaster that covered the stone surface. Reliefs were then decorated with gilding, inlay, or paint. The paints were usually mixtures of mineral pigments {{with some kind of}} adhesive, possibly natural gum.|$|E

The deposited clusters with sizes 4 nm or larger show a body-centered crystal (bcc) structure. The clusters are self-assembled from smaller structural units and form <b>cuboids</b> with a typical size of 4 nm or larger. With reducing cluster size, the face-centered crystal (fcc) structure appears due to dominance of surface energy minimization, while self-assembly into large <b>cuboids</b> with sizes up to 30 nm is still observed.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{introduce}} a volumetric partitioning strategy {{based on a}} generalized sweeping framework to seamlessly partition the volume of an input triangle mesh into a collection of deformed <b>cuboids.</b> This is achieved by a user-designed volumetric harmonic function that guides the decomposition of the input volume into a sequence of 2 -manifold level sets. A skeletal structure whose corners correspond to corner vertices of a 2 D parameterization is extracted for each level set. Corners are placed so that the skeletal structure aligns with features of the input object. Then, a skeletal surface is constructed by matching the skeletal structures of adjacent level sets. The surface sheets of this skeletal surface partition the input volume into the deformed <b>cuboids.</b> The collection of <b>cuboids</b> does not exhibit T-junctions, significantly simplifying the hexahedral mesh generation process, and in particular, it simplifies fitting trivariate B-splines to the deformed <b>cuboids.</b> Intersections of the surface sheets of the skeletal surface correspond to the singular edges of the generated hex-meshes. We apply our technique {{to a variety of}} 3 D objects and demonstrate the benefit of the structure decomposition in data fitting.

25|$|Spatial {{resolution}} of an fMRI study refers {{to how well}} it discriminates between nearby locations. It {{is measured by the}} size of voxels, as in MRI. A voxel is a three-dimensional rectangular <b>cuboid,</b> whose dimensions are set by the slice thickness, the area of a slice, and the grid imposed on the slice by the scanning process. Full-brain studies use larger voxels, while those that focus on specific regions of interest typically use smaller sizes. Sizes range from 4 to 5mm to 1mm. Smaller voxels contain fewer neurons on average, incorporate less blood flow, and hence have less signal than larger voxels. Smaller voxels imply longer scanning times, since scanning time directly rises with the number of voxels per slice and the number of slices. This can lead both to discomfort for the subject inside the scanner and to loss of the magnetization signal. A voxel typically contains a few million neurons and tens of billions of synapses, with the actual number depending on voxel size and the area of the brain being imaged.|$|E
