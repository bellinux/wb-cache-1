The establishment of the NDSTIC was a reform measure designed to break down the barriers between civilian and military {{research and development and}} industry. Military science and industry previously had been secretive, segregated, and privileged sectors, having material, financial, and personnel resources superior to those available to the civilian sector. The creation of the NDSTIC was one measure by which Chinese leaders hoped to facilitate the transfer of technology between the military and civilian sectors. The NDSTIC, in particular through its trading arm, China Xinshidai Corporation, coordinated procurement of foreign technology for military purposes.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} why {{the housing}} subsidy programme in South Africa has {{had so little}} impact on poverty reduction despite its scale and generous funding. It discusses how this {{was linked to the}} government's conception of housing, the institutions involved and who <b>controlled</b> <b>funding</b> flows for housing. Most government funding went to contractors to build new units "for the poor"; it was assumed that these would replace homes in informal settlements that the poor developed themselves. Despite statements about the government's commitment to the People's Housing Process (PHP), informal settlements were only seen in negative terms and there was no support for incremental upgrading and very little support for low-income households to build their own homes. Meanwhile, the contractor-built houses were usually too small, of poor quality and in locations far from livelihoods and services. The paper ends with suggestions for how the formal institutions of government can learn to support and work with the poor. The incremental approaches of the poor to their own housing and livelihoods can serve as an alternative first principle for conceiving of the challenge of human settlements policy and practice. Furthermore, funding flows and their associated institutions should support people-centred development and institutionalize systems that make the informed participation of residents of informal settlements a pre-condition for state support.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that tobacco <b>control</b> <b>funding</b> in California has reduced per capita cigarette consumption and per capita healthcare expenditures. This paper refines our earlier model by estimating the effect of California tobacco <b>control</b> <b>funding</b> on current smoking prevalence and cigarette consumption per smoker and the effect of prevalence and consumption on per capita healthcare expenditures. The results are used to calculate new estimates of the effect of the California Tobacco Program. Using state-specific aggregate data, current smoking prevalence and cigarette consumption per smoker are modeled as functions of cumulative California and control states' per capita tobacco <b>control</b> <b>funding,</b> cigarette price, and per capita income. Per capita healthcare expenditures are modeled as a function of prevalence of current smoking, cigarette consumption per smoker, and per capita income. One additional dollar of cumulative per capita tobacco <b>control</b> <b>funding</b> is associated with reduction in current smoking prevalence of 0. 0497 (SE. 00347) percentage points and current smoker cigarette consumption of 1. 39 (SE. 132) packs per smoker per year. Reductions of one percentage point in current smoking prevalence and one pack smoked per smoker are associated with $ 35. 4 (SE $ 9. 85) and $ 3. 14 (SE. 786) reductions in per capita healthcare expenditure, respectively (2010 dollars), using the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) measure of healthcare spending. Between FY 1989 and 2008 the California Tobacco Program cost $ 2. 4 billion and led to cumulative NIPA healthcare expenditure savings of $ 134 (SE $ 30. 5) billion...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Tobacco {{cessation}} telephone quitlines are {{an effective}} population-wide strategy for smoking cessation, but funding for this service varies widely. State-level factors may explain this difference. Data from the 2005 and 2006 North American Quitline Consortium surveys and from publicly available sources were analyzed to identify factors that predict {{higher levels of}} per capita quitline funding. The best-fitting multivariate model comprised higher per capita tobacco <b>control</b> <b>funding</b> (2005 p = 0. 004, 2006 p= 0. 000), not securitizing Master Settlement Agreement payments (2005 p = 0. 008, 2006 p= 0. 01), and liberal political ideology (2005 p = 0. 002, 2006 p= 0. 002). Select state-level factors appear to have influenced per capita quitline services funding. These findings can help inform advocates and policymakers as they advocate for quitlines and tobacco <b>control</b> <b>funding...</b>|$|R
