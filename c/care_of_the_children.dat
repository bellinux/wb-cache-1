5|$|The ancient Egyptians {{placed a}} great value on hygiene and appearance. Most {{bathed in the}} Nile and used a pasty soap made from animal fat and chalk. Men shaved their entire bodies for cleanliness; {{perfumes}} and aromatic ointments covered bad odors and soothed skin.

Children went without clothing until maturity, at about age 12, and at this age males were circumcised and had their heads shaved.

40|$|The {{research}} so far {{indicates that}} {{the context in which}} the father’s role takes place significantly influences the form and level of father involvement in taking <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>child.</b> <b>The</b> primary goal <b>of</b> this research was to describe the forms and effects of maternal gate-keeping behavior as a characteristic form of interaction between parents which is, as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> context, considered a significant factor in father involvement in <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>child.</b> Research participants were 247 parental couples from complete families whose oldest child attended a pre-school institution. Fathers provided assessments of their own involvement via the Father Involvement Inventory, as well as assessments of prominence of gate-keeping behavior in their wives via <b>the</b> checklist <b>of</b> maternal gate-keeping behavior. Mothers reported on their beliefs about the importance and possibilities of father involvement in <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>child,</b> as well as on their personal satisfaction with <b>the</b> current involvement <b>of</b> their husband in <b>the</b> joint <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>child.</b> <b>The</b> results point out to <b>the</b> particular forms <b>of</b> mothers’ ambivalence when it comes to <b>the</b> joint <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>child,</b> which is a form <b>of</b> gate-keeping behavior. <b>The</b> frequency <b>of</b> gate-keeping behavior, assessed by the checklist, significantly changes <b>the</b> possibilities <b>of</b> father involvement in taking <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> in <b>the</b> developmental phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family, having in mind that <b>the</b> task <b>of</b> this phase is precisely <b>the</b> definition <b>of</b> parental roles and formation of parent cooperative principle...|$|R

5|$|As {{the term}} double burden might suggest, when people {{consider}} paid work vs. unpaid work, they often consider them as two separate entities - {{that the man}} or woman is doing one or the other, {{but not at the}} same time. In reality, men and especially women often undertake both paid and unpaid labor simultaneously, creating the issue of work intensity, where the person undertakes many activities {{at the same time in}} order to compensate for the time necessary to accomplish many things in one day. Household surveys often only let people write down one thing that they are doing at any given time, and do not take into consideration that they may be cooking while cleaning, or sewing while taking <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children.</b> Because of this, the time taken for child care and other domestic activities may be underestimated. This coping mechanism of undertaking two or more tasks at once can especially be seen in women in developing countries. For example, many Caribbean rural women use this as a method of increasing the number of things they can accomplish in a day.|$|E

25|$|Many {{people of}} sub-Saharan Africa choose to foster their {{children}} to infertile women. IVF enables these infertile women {{to have their own}} children, which imposes new ideals to a culture in which fostering children is seen as both natural and culturally important. Many infertile women are able to earn more respect in their society by taking <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> of other mothers, and this may be lost if they choose to use IVF instead. As IVF is seen as unnatural, it may even hinder their societal position as opposed to making them equal with fertile women. It is also economically advantageous for infertile women to raise foster children as it gives these children greater ability to access resources that are important for their development and also aids the development of their society at large. If IVF becomes more popular without the birth rate decreasing, there could be more large family homes with fewer options to send their newborn children. This could result in an increase of orphaned children and/or a decrease in resources for the children of large families. This would ultimately stifle the children's and the community's growth.|$|E

Her nephew Santiago (Gael García Bernal) offers to take her and the kids to the wedding. They cross the border uneventfully and the children are soon confronted by the Mexican culture and street scene. The revelry of the wedding extends well into the evening, and the kids enjoy themselves in the festivities. Rather than staying the night in Mexico with the children, Amelia decides to drive back to the States with Santiago. He has been drinking heavily and the border guards become suspicious of him and the American children in the car. Amelia has passports for all four travelers, but no letter of consent from the children's parents allowing her to take them out of the United States. Intoxicated and worried, Santiago trespasses the border. He soon abandons Amelia and the children in the desert, attempting to lead off the police; his fate after this is unknown.|$|E

[...] Nevertheless, in November 1971, a Gallup Poll still had him in first place in the Democratic nomination race with 28percent. George McGovern was close to clinching the Democratic nomination in June 1972, when various anti-McGovern forces tried to get Kennedy to enter the contest at the last minute, but he declined. At the 1972 Democratic National Convention, McGovern repeatedly tried to recruit Kennedy as his vice presidential running mate, but Kennedy turned him down. When McGovern's choice of Thomas Eagleton stepped down soon after the convention, McGovern again tried to get Kennedy to take the nod, again without success.
