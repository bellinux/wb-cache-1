5|$|Another {{factor was}} the weather within the {{operational}} theater. The cyclical monsoon patterns {{meant that the}} weather was deplorable for flight operations eight {{months of the year}} (from late September to early May) when rain and fog tended to conceal targets. Lack of adequate all-weather and night-bombing capability made it necessary for the majority of U.S. missions to be <b>conducted</b> <b>during</b> daylight hours, thereby easing the burden on the air defense forces of North Vietnam.|$|E
