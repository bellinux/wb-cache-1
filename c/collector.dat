All these states had a considerable degree of internal autonomy. However, their foreign policy was completely controlled by a Resident who represented the Governor of Fort St George. In case of Banganapalle, the Resident was the District <b>Collector</b> of Kurnool, while the District <b>Collector</b> of Bellary was the Resident of Sandur. The Resident of Pudukkottai from 1800 to 1840 and 1865 to 1873, was the District <b>Collector</b> of Tanjore, from 1840 to 1865, the District <b>Collector</b> of Madura and from 1873 to 1947, the District <b>Collector</b> of Trichinopoly.|$|E

40|$|Regional garbage {{collection}} offers a useful compromise between real-time and generational collection. Regional <b>collectors</b> resemble generational <b>collectors,</b> but are scalable: our main theorem guarantees a positive lower bound, independent of mutator and live storage, for the theoretical worst-case minimum mutator utilization (MMU). The theorem also establishes upper bounds for worst-case space usage and collection pauses. Standard generational <b>collectors</b> are not scalable. Some realtime <b>collectors</b> are scalable, while others assume a well-behaved mutator or provide no worst-case guarantees at all. Regional <b>collectors</b> cannot compete with hard real-time <b>collectors</b> at millisecond resolutions, but offer efficiency comparable to contemporary generational <b>collectors</b> combined with improved latency and MMU at resolutions {{on the order}} of hundreds of milliseconds to a few seconds...|$|R
