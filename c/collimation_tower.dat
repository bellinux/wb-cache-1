5000|$|The Target Tracking Radar Station was a Nike Zeus test {{facility}} for tracking reentry vehicles from Cape Canaveral missile launches. Built from 1960-1961 for anti-ballistic missile measurement, the [...] "Golf Ball" [...] was on Cat Hill, and a <b>collimation</b> <b>tower</b> for radar calibration was towards English Bay.|$|E
50|$|As of late 2016 the Station {{has five}} large antennas in use: DSS-34, DSS-35, DSS36, DSS-43, and DSS-45. The CDSCC also uses the Parkes radio {{telescope}} in central New South Wales at busy times to receive data from spacecraft. There has been ongoing construction since 2010 building additional 34 m beam waveguide antenna. Construction of DSS-35 began in July 2010. The station's <b>collimation</b> <b>tower</b> is located approximately 3 km to the north-west, on Black Hill.|$|E
5000|$|The Milit√§rhistorische Stiftung des Kantons Zug {{has taken}} over the {{operation}} of the protected air defense control armament position BL-64 ZG [...] "Bloodhound" [...] on the Gubel in the municipality of Menzingen. The facility can be visited during guided tours. The BL-64 ZG [...] "Bloodhound" [...] {{is the only one of}} the former six air defense control armament position of the British type Bloodhound Mark II , which has been permanently maintained in the Swiss Mittelland and Jura, and has been kept in high readiness during the last years, without any interruptions. The air defense weapons [...] "Bloodhound" [...] had been procured for the protection of the Swiss airspace, together with the Mirage IIIS and the FLORIDA Airspace monitoring and management system. Since the 1960s, the three systems have been used up to the end of the millennium. Their tasks are now taken over by the combat aircraft F/A-18 Hornet and the new radar system FLORAKO. The ground-based air defense weapon [...] "Bloodhound" [...] has not received any successor system.The entire facility remains the property of the Swiss Confederation and the Defense Department (DDPS). One of the former two units is under cantonal Cultural heritage management.In summer, several of the eight launcher will be equipped with original, but inert missiles. The complete electronic and mechanical facilities are at their original location. The main components of the SAM system are: Command center with deployment point, radar, power supply with diesel units, launcher, underground missile magazines, a <b>collimation</b> <b>tower</b> and transmission systems. Within the complex there is a developed street network, in the entrance area the military camp is used by the VBS. The anti-aircraft weaponry BL-64 ZG [...] "Bloodhound" [...] is today the only one of its kind in the world.|$|E
40|$|Based {{on a new}} {{approach}} on modeling the magnetically dominated outflows from AGNs (Li et al. 2006), we study the propagation of magnetic tower jets in gravitationally stratified atmospheres (such as a galaxy cluster environment) in large scales ($>$ tens of kpc) by performing three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. We present the {{detailed analysis of the}} MHD waves, the cylindrical radial force balance, and the <b>collimation</b> of magnetic <b>tower</b> jets. As magnetic energy is injected into a small central volume over a finite amount of time, the magnetic fields expand down the background density gradient, forming a collimated jet and an expanded ``lobe'' due to the gradually decreasing background density and pressure. Both the jet and lobes are magnetically dominated. In addition, the injection and expansion produce a hydrodynamic shock wave that is moving ahead of and enclosing the magnetic tower jet. This shock can eventually break the hydrostatic equilibrium in the ambient medium and cause a global gravitational contraction. This contraction produces a strong compression {{at the head of the}} magnetic tower front and helps to collimate radially to produce a slender-shaped jet. At the outer edge of the jet, the magnetic pressure is balanced by the background (modified) gas pressure, without any significant contribution from the hoop stress. On the other hand, along the central axis of the jet, hoop stress is the dominant force in shaping the central collimation of the poloidal current. The system, which possesses a highly wound helical magnetic configuration, never quite reaches a force-free equilibrium state though the evolution becomes much slower at late stages. The simulations were performed without any initial perturbations so the overall structures of the jet remain mostly axisymmetric.

40|$|A {{need for}} an {{accurate}} but inexpensive method for measuring and evaluating time delays of large ground antennas for VLBI applications motivated {{the development of the}} <b>collimation</b> <b>tower</b> technique. Supporting analytical work which was performed primarily to verify time delay measurement results obtained for a large antenna when the transmitter was at a collimation distance of 1 / 25 of the usual far field criterion is discussed. Comparisons of theoretical and experimental results are also given...|$|E
