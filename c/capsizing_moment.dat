50|$|When {{travelling}} in a curve, {{the tires}} provide the centripetal force {{needed for the}} acceleration towards {{the center of the}} curve. The <b>capsizing</b> <b>moment</b> provided by the motorcycle's lean into the corner is in moment equilibrium with the centripetal forces at the ground when all is working correctly. If, having reached a given lean angle, the centripetal forces are reduced then the motorcycle increases its angle of lean until it touches the road surface, usually unseating the rider in the process.|$|E
5000|$|The hull {{construction}} is of fibreglass-reinforced polyester in a foam sandwich layout. The fully battened mainsail and jib {{are made from}} a transparent Mylar laminate with orange or red Dacron trimming, while the spinnaker is manufactured from ripstop Nylon. The mast is in three parts - an aluminium bottom and middle section, with a polyester-fiberglass composite tip to increase mast bend and decrease both overall weight, and the <b>capsizing</b> <b>moment</b> a heavy mast tip can generate. Foils are aluminium or fibreglass.|$|E

50|$|MS Herald of Free Enterprise was a roll-on/roll-off (RORO) ferry which <b>capsized</b> <b>moments</b> {{after leaving}} the Belgian port of Zeebrugge {{on the night of}} 6 March 1987, killing 193 {{passengers}} and crew.|$|R
60|$|The horse, {{struck by}} the shaft, lashed out in agony and terror; the boat <b>capsized,</b> and next <b>moment</b> all were {{struggling}} in the eddies of the river.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here is a spare paddle," [...] Harry said, as {{he pulled}} one out from below the network, [...] "there is not a moment to lose. Keep your eyes open, chief." [...] Again the boat moved down the stream. With four paddles going the {{steersman}} had somewhat more control over her, but as she flew down the seething water, glanced past rocks and sprang over falls, Tom expected her to <b>capsize</b> every <b>moment.</b> At last he saw below them a stretch of quiet water, {{and two or three}} minutes later they were floating upon it, and as if by a common impulse all ceased rowing.|$|R
2500|$|In December 1942, Queen Mary carried 16,082 American {{soldiers}} from New York to Great Britain, a standing {{record for the}} most passengers ever transported on one vessel. During this trip, while [...] from Scotland during a gale, she was suddenly hit broadside by a rogue wave that may have reached a height of [...] An account of this crossing {{can be found in}} Carter's book. As quoted in the book, Carter's father, Dr. Norval Carter, part of the 110th Station Hospital on board at the time, wrote in a letter that at one point Queen Mary [...] "damned near <b>capsized...</b> One <b>moment</b> the top deck was at its usual height and then, swoom! Down, over, and forward she would pitch." [...] It was calculated later that the ship rolled 52 degrees, and would have capsized had she rolled another 3 degrees. The incident inspired Paul Gallico to write his novel, The Poseidon Adventure (1969) and carry the incident to a fictional extreme. This was adapted as a 1972 film by the same name, in which the SS Poseidon is turned upside-down, and the trapped passengers try to escape. Naturally parts of the film were shot in the actual Queen Mary, conveniently docked in Long Beach.|$|R
5000|$|Buckmaster was criticised by {{some historians}} {{for what was}} deemed the {{premature}} abandonment of Yorktown after she was struck by two torpedoes at the Battle of Midway. Buckmaster, consulting with his Executive Officer, Dixie Kiefer and the Ship's Chief Engineer Officer John F. Delaney, Jr., all concluded that without power, the undoing of the very superficial repairs made at Pearl Harbor following the Coral Sea Battle {{there was no hope}} of correcting a list that varied between 26 and 28 degrees. Indeed, it was feared [...] "that the vessel might <b>capsize</b> at any <b>moment</b> and take many crewman below decks with her". According to Yorktown crewmen, Buckmaster was thinking only of his ships company's welfare. While Yorktown was later re-boarded, she was sunk by I-168 following a torpedo attack that also sank [...]|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should let}} them run out fast at first, Jerry, only keeping enough strain {{on them to}} keep her head well up stream. Begin to check her gradually, and let her down only inch by inch. When you see we {{are close to the}} rocks, hold her there while we get her alongside, and don't leave go till we lift her from the water. Directly we are out, fasten the ropes to the bow of your canoe, then launch her carefully; and {{whatever}} you do, don't let go of the rope. Launch her stern first close to the wall, then two get in and get well towards the stern, while the other holds the rope until the last moment. Then those two in the boat must begin to paddle as hard as they can, while the last man jumps in and snatches up his paddle. Keep her head close to the wall, for if the current catches it and takes her round she would <b>capsize</b> in a <b>moment</b> against those rocks. Paddle all you know; we shall haul in the rope as fast as you come down. When you come abreast two of us will check her, and the others will be on the rocks to catch hold of her side as she swings in." ...|$|R
60|$|Tired seemingly, he ceased. His {{questioner}} perceiving {{that he was}} {{not likely}} to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer, fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe, suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed, it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant to rule the waves. On more than one occasion, a dozen at the lowest, near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings. And it left him wondering why. Possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under, well, not exactly under, tempting the fates. And the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all. Nevertheless, without going into the minutiae of the business, the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was a highly laudable institution to which the public at large, no matter where living inland or seaside, as the case might be, having it brought home to them like that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements whatever the season when duty called Ireland expects that every man and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to <b>capsize</b> at any <b>moment,</b> rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather.|$|R
