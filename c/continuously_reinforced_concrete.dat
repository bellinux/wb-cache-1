50|$|Three main {{types of}} {{concrete}} pavements commonly used are Jointed plain concrete pavement (JPCP), jointed reinforced concrete pavement (JRCP), and <b>continuously</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> pavements (CRCP). JPCP’s are constructed with contraction joints which direct the natural cracking of the pavement. These pavements {{do not use}} any reinforcing steel. JRCP’s are constructed with both contraction joints and reinforcing steel to control the cracking of the pavement. High temperatures and moisture stresses within the pavement creates cracking, which the reinforcing steel holds tightly together. At transverse joints, dowel bars are typically placed to assist with transferring the load of the vehicle across the cracking. CRCP’s solely rely on continuous reinforcing steel to hold the pavement’s natural transverse cracks together. Prestressed concrete pavements have also {{been used in the}} construction of highways; however, they are not as common as the other three. Prestressed pavements allow for a thinner slab thickness by partly or wholly neutralizing thermally induced stresses or loadings.|$|E

Two series of simply and continuously supported CFRP and GFRP <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> beams were tested in flexure. In addition, a <b>continuously</b> supported steel <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> beam was tested for comparison purposes. The FRP <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> continuous beams were reinforced {{in a way to}} accomplish three possible reinforcement combinations at the top and bottom layers of such continuous beams. The experimental results revealed that over-reinforcing the bottom layer of either the simply or continuously supported FRP beams is a key factor in controlling the width and propagation of cracks, enhancing the load capacity, and reducing the deflection of such beams. However, continuous <b>concrete</b> beams <b>reinforced</b> with CFRP bars exhibited a remarkable wide crack over the middle support that significantly influenced their behaviour. The ACI 440. 1 R- 06 equations have been validated against experimental results of beams tested. Comparisons between experimental results and those obtained from simplified methods proposed by the ACI 440 Committee show that ACI 440. 1 R- 06 equations can reasonably predict the load capacity and deflection of the simply and <b>continuously</b> supported GFRP <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> beams tested. However, The potential capabilities of these equations for predicting the load capacity and deflection of continuous CFRP <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> beams have, however, been adversely affected by the de-bonding of top CFRP bars from concrete. An analytical technique, which presents an iterative procedure based on satisfying force equilibrium and deformation compatibility conditions, has been introduced in this research. This technique developed a computer program to investigate flexural behaviour in particular the flexural strength and deflection of simple and <b>continuously</b> supported FRP <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> beams. The analytical modelling program has been compared against different prediction methods, namely ACI 440, the bilinear method, mean moment inertia method and Benmokrane¿s method. This comparison revealed the reliability of this programme in producing more enhanced results in predicting the behaviour of the FRP reinforced beams more than the above stated methods...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{on the application}} of basalt fibre reinforced polymer (BFRP) and carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) bars as longitudinal reinforcement for simple and continuous concrete slabs is presented. Eight continuously and four simply concrete slabs were constructed and tested to failure. Two <b>continuously</b> supported steel <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> slabs were also tested for comparison purposes. The slabs were classified into two groups according {{to the type of}} FRP bars. All slabs tested were 500 mm in width and 150 mm in depth. The simply supported slabs had a span of 2000 mm, whereas the continuous slabs had two equal spans, each of 2000 mm. Different combinations of under and over FRP (BFRP/CFRP) reinforcement at the top and bottom layers of slabs were investigated. The continuously supported BFRP and CFRP <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> slabs exhibited larger deflections and wider cracks than the counterpart reinforced with steel. The experimental results showed that increasing the bottom mid-span FRP reinforcement of continuous slabs is more effective than the top over middle support FRP reinforcement in improving the load capacity and reducing mid-span deflections. Design guidelines have been validated against experimental results of FRP <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> slabs tested. ISIS¿M 03 ¿ 07 and CSA S 806 - 06 equations reasonably predicted the deflections of the slabs tested. However, ACI 440 ¿ 1 R- 06 underestimated the deflections, overestimated the moment capacities at mid-span and over support sections, and reasonably predicted the load capacity of the continuous slabs tested. On the analytical side, a numerical technique consisting of sectional and longitudinal analyses has been developed to predict the moment¿curvature relationship, moment capacity and load-deflection of FRP <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> members. The numerical technique has been validated against the experimental test results obtained from the current research and those reported in the literature. A parametric study using the numerical technique developed has also been conducted to examine the influence of FRP reinforcement ratio, concrete compressive strength and type of reinforcement on the performance of continuous FRP <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> slabs.

40|$|Thin bonded {{asphalt and}} thicker, {{unbonded}} concrete overlays for concrete pavements can offer some benefits to worn concrete pavements such as restore skid resistance and riding quality {{as well as}} reduce routine maintenance. <b>Continuously</b> <b>Reinforced</b> Bonded <b>Concrete</b> Overlays (CRBCO) can offer all the above plus a ‘greener’ and sustainable {{solution to the problem}} of rigid road and airfield repairs, because they make use of the remaining strength of the worn pavement. Hence, they can offer both, real savings as well as environmental benefits over the wholesale demolition, removal and complete reconstruction of the existing pavement. This paper is the introduction of a research study dealing with the development of CRBCO as a new material and method of construction. It demonstrates that it is possible to go for a wholesale replacement of the traditional steel reinforcement with new, innovative, corrosion free, easier and faster to apply synthetic alternatives and at the same time make a positive contribution to flexural resistance, crack control, shear and bond strength of the rehabilitated pavement. Finally, it stresses the need for further research for the new material and method to become widely applicable. It is hoped that the advent of more high-quality, high-tensile strength concretes and techniques, such as high-speed paving and roller compaction, combined with careful attention to all the design requirements will enable pavement engineers to exploit the advantages in terms of economy, convenience and long maintenance-free, greener life which CRBCO could offer in the future...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSES: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate construction issues and design for transverse steel in <b>continuously</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> pavement(CRCP). METHODS: The first <b>continuously</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>concrete</b> pavement(CRCP) design procedure appeared in the 1972 edition of the “AASHTO Interim Guide for Design of Pavement Structures,”which was published in 1981 with Chapter 3 “Guide for the Design of Rigid Pavement” revised. A theory that was accepted at that time for the analysis of steel stress in concrete pavement, called subgrade drag theory(SGDT), was utilized for the design of reinforcement of CRCP- tie bar design and transverse steel design- in the aforementioned AASHTO Interim Guide. However SGDT has severe limitations due to simple assumptions made in the development of the theory. As a result, any design procedures for reinforcement utilizing SGDT may have intrinsic flaws and limitations. In this paper, CRCP design procedure for transverse steel was introduced and the limitations of assumptions for SGDT were evaluated based on various field testing. RESULTS: Various field tests were conducted to evaluate whether the assumptions of SGDT are reasonable or not. Test results show that 1) temperature variations exist along the concrete slab depth, 2) very little stress in transverse steel, and 3) warping and curling in concrete slab from the field test results. As a result, it is clearly revealed out that the assumptions of SGDT are not valid, and transverse steel and tie bar designs should be based on more reasonable theories.
