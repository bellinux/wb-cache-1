50|$|The odd {{shape of}} the leaves is an {{adaption}} to arid environments and allows for the storage of water while exposing a minimum amount of surface area per volume to the dry desert air. This greatly reduces water loss due to evaporation relative to the typical dorsi-ventrally flattened leaves of most angiosperms. Although its spherical leaf morphology contributes to minimizing water loss, it also dramatically reduces the area available for the absorption of light and <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>potentially</b> <b>detrimental</b> to the plant's rate of photosynthetic carbon assimilation. An adaptation that may help compensate for this reduction in light interception is a narrow, translucent, crescent-shaped band of tissue on the adaxial side of the lamina. This specialized structure {{is known as a}} “epidermal window” and it allows light to enter and irradiate the interior of the leaf, effectively increasing the area of leaf tissue available for photosynthesis. This is a trait shared with Senecio radicans, a close relative of Senecio rowleyanus. A similar morphology is observed in species of the genus Fenestraria as well as the species Haworthia cooperi and Frithia pulchra, which grow underground and only expose their leaf tips to absorb light radiation.|$|E

Tender leaves of B. papyrifera from a heavy traffic site (HTS) and a low traffic site (LTS) were collected for the determination of non–metallic nutrient elements (N, P and S), metallic nutrient elements (K, Ca, Mg, Cu, Zn, Mn, Ni, Cr and Mo), non–essential metallic elements (Al, Cd and Pb) and 16 EPA priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Leaves of B. papyrifera were abundant with P, S, K, Mg, and Ca.

40|$|Abstract: Lead (Pb 2 +) is a toxic {{heavy metal}} that has {{adverse effects on}} the health of humans and other animals. The {{developing}} central nervous system is especially sensitive and vulnerable to Pb 2 + toxicity. In this study, the effects of low levels of Pb 2 + exposure on human SH-SY 5 Y neuroblastoma cell cultures were assessed. The cells were exposed to Pb 2 + (0. 01 µM- 10 µM) for 48 hrs, and the level of cell proliferation was determined. Pb 2 + significantly inhibited the proliferation of neuroblastoma cells in a concentration-dependent manner. A 50 % inhibition (IC 50) in cellular proliferation was observed with 5 µM Pb 2 +. A significant decrease in the levels of glutathione (GSH), a critical intracellular antioxidant, was observed at all the lead concentrations. There was also a multifold increase in the activity of caspase- 3, a key executioner of apoptosis, and in the levels of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2). Our results suggest that the neurotoxic effects of Pb may be mediated by apoptosis and PGE 2 release, which <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>potentially</b> <b>detrimental</b> to neuronal survival...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Evolutionary-new {{centromere}}s (ENCs) {{result from}} the seeding of a centromere at an ectopic location along the chromosome during evolution. The novel centromere rapidly acquires the complex structure typical of eukaryote centromeres. This phenomenon has {{played an important role}} in shaping primate karyotypes. A recent study on the evolutionary-new centromere of macaque chromosome 4 (human 6) showed that the evolutionary-new centromere domain was deeply restructured, following the seeding, with respect to the corresponding human region assumed as ancestral. It was also demonstrated that the region was devoid of genes. We hypothesized that these two observations were not merely coincidental and that the absence of genes in the seeding area constituted a crucial condition for the evolutionary-new centromere fixation in the population. RESULTS: To test our hypothesis, we characterized 14 evolutionary-new centromeres selected according to conservative criteria. Using different experimental approaches, we assessed the extent of genomic restructuring. We then determined the gene density in the ancestral domain where each evolutionary-new centromere was seeded. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that restructuring of the seeding regions is an intrinsic property of novel evolutionary centromeres that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> regarded as <b>potentially</b> <b>detrimental</b> to the normal functioning of genes embedded in the region. The absence of genes, which was found to be of high statistical significance, appeared as a unique favorable scenario permissive of evolutionary-new centromere fixation in the population...|$|R

40|$|Nonsense Mediated mRNA Decay (NMD) is a translation-coupled mRNA {{surveillance}} mechanism which targets aberrant mRNAs harbouring premature termination codons (PTCs). This {{class of}} mutations would otherwise {{result in the}} translation of truncated proteins that <b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> <b>be</b> <b>detrimental</b> to the cell. Intriguingly, NMD is linked to pre-mRNA splicing: in mammalian cells PTCs induce strong NMD only {{in the presence of}} a downstream intron. In these systems, the link between pre-mRNA splicing and NMD is thought to be mediated by the Exon-Junction-Complex (EJC), which is a multiprotein complex that marks splice junctions. In fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, pre-mRNA splicing can also enhance NMD however this mechanism does not require the EJC. To gain further insight into the mechanisms of NMD I undertook a genome-wide screen to identify and characterize additional factors that may be involved in this process in fission yeast. In particular, I hoped to identify genes required for the link between splicing and NMD. The screen consisted of crossing a GFP reporter strain subject to NMD with haploid deletion mutants of 3, 308 non-essential genes in the S. pombe. Analysis of 2790 mutants identified 18 candidates. These were further characterised by northern blot analysis. From these 18 strains, 7 mutants look like genuine NMD mutants resembling the phenotype of known NMD genes. 5 genes have either direct or indirect links with splicing factors or the exosome-associated TRAMP complex. Future work will need to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the NMD phenotype and possible involvement of these genes in splicing, NMD and the TRAMP-mediated mRNA surveillance processes...|$|R

To date, little work has focused on the third body abrasion of CoCrMo and therefore there is a general lack of understanding of the effect of abrasive size and volume concentration on the tribo-corrosion performance of the CoCrMo alloys. The present work assessed the tribo-corrosion behaviour of cast CoCrMo (F- 75) under various abrasion–corrosion conditions by using a modified microabrasion tester incorporating a three-electrode electrochemical cell. The effects of reduced abrasive size/hardness and volume concentration, as well as the role of proteins on the tribo-corrosion performance of the cast CoCrMo alloy were addressed. The correlation between electrochemical and mechanical processes for different abrasion–corrosion test conditions has been discussed in detail. Results show that the reduction in abrasive size and volume concentration can significantly affect the abrasion–corrosion wear mechanisms and the wear-induced corrosion response of the material. The finding of this study implies that the smaller/softer third body particles generated in vivo could also result in significant wear-induced corrosion and therefore potential metal ion release, which <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>potentially</b> <b>detrimental</b> to both the patient health and the life span of the implants...|$|E

Not only {{the threat of}} death and impact of breast cancer treatment, but also the participation roles during treatment decision making can be substantial, leading to psychological distress and poor quality of life. Previous studies have explored patients’ participation preference, the extent of participation congruence and related factors, revealing that women suffering from breast cancer may benefit from participation in treatment decision making whilst participation incongruity <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>potentially</b> <b>detrimental</b> for women with breast cancer. Objectives This study aimed to systematically review the literature and summarize the extent of breast cancer patients’ participation preference, participation congruence, and related factors. Methods Multiple searches for key words were conducted through electronic sources, including PubMed, PsycINFO, and Medline via Ovid databases for all relevant English language literature. Studies were selected basing on specific inclusion/exclusion criteria. The STROBE checklist was applied for reporting quality assessment. Results A total of 778 studies were identified. Twelve eligible studies were included in this review. Twelve factors relating to breast cancer women’s participation congruence in treatment decision making were identified as follows: age, nature of preferred role of treatment decision making, educational level, time related issues, language/ethnicity, marital status, information and recommendations of treatment, offering treatment options, physician characteristics, type of therapy or cancer program, stage of breast cancer, and surgeon volume. Conclusions Three themes (i. e. patient oriented, physician-patient interaction, and medical provision) of intervention points towards patient participation congruence were synthesized and discussed, and they were useful for {{improving the quality of}} existing breast cancer treatment decision making by addressing patient’s perceived participation congruence. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Business Administration)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2005 Project risk {{management}} is concemed with identifying, assessing {{and responding to}} uncertainties which could impact project outcomes. These impacts might be positive or negative, although the tendency in business has been {{to focus on the}} negative - or downside - risks, Le., those risks which <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>potentially</b> <b>detrimental</b> to project outcomes. Risk management requires an investment in time, effort and cost. For this reason, it has to be efficient if it is going to make business-sense. If it can be shown that {{risk management}} plays a positive role in supporting successful project delivery, then the case for investing in risk management will be validated. This study focuses on two projects within Old Mutual, to investigate the link between risk management and project success. Both projects had been approved by the company's Strategic Investment Committee (SICOM), which required that they conform to various governance criteria, including that their risks be managed according to a specified process. One of the projects - CRAFT - was deemed by its stakehoiders to have delivered successfully, while the other - SSA - was perceived to have had mixed results. As a precursor to the study, an extensive review of the current literature on project risk management was undertaken. The literature was found to be largely consistent in its definition of project risk management, and to be concerned mainly with developing the processes and techniques for improving risk management in the live project environment. Based on the literature, it was possible to develop an analytical framework for use as a generic tool in evaluating the role which effective risk management practice could have on project success...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Allergy to cow s {{milk protein}} is the most common food allergy in {{children}} under the age of three years. A diet without milk or dairy products <b>is</b> <b>potentially</b> low in many nutrients and could put the child at risk of malnutrition and compromised growth. Dairy products are a major source of iodine in the Norwegian diet, and excluding dairy products may negatively affect iodine status. Insufficient iodine status during childhood <b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> <b>be</b> <b>detrimental</b> and put the child at risk for delays in mental development and poor growth. Objectives: The main objectives of this study was to investigate iodine intake and status along with growth in infants and young children under two years of age who were on a {{cow s milk}} protein free diet and to identify factors affecting iodine status and growth in these children. Methods: Fifty-seven infants and children under two years of age where included in a larger cross-sectional study on the nutritional status of children on {{cow s milk protein}} free diets (MILKID study). Two spot urine samples from were collected and analysed for iodine, together with a three day food record and a food frequency questionnaire on dietary sources of iodine. Urine iodine concentrations were compared to the WHO cut-off values for iodine deficiency. Weight, length and head circumference were recorded at birth and at inclusion in the study and compared to the Norwegian growth standard. Sub-group analyses were done on different feeding patterns, according to weaning status. Results: One third of the children had iodine deficiency according to urine iodine concentration (UIC). Children who were mainly breastfed were at highest risk and 58 % was classified as deficient. Dietary factors associated with iodine were intake of enriched baby cereals (r = 0. 230, p = 0. 02) and reaching RDI for iodine through diet (r= 0. 313, p = 0. 03). Children of mothers who took supplement with iodine had higher urinary iodine concentrations, though this was not significant. Growth in length was compromised in boys, 11 % of the infants had weight for age z-score (WAZ) and BMI for age z-score (BMIZ) of ≤ - 2 and 5 % length for age z-scores (LAZ) of ≤ - 2 at inclusion and this was associated with food refusal and low appetite, but not associated with iodine deficiency. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that the exclusion of cow s milk protein puts the child at risk of deficiency of iodine and poor growth, however the two conditions were not related. Infants reliant on breast milk as their main iodine source are at increased risk of iodine deficiency. Boys with feeding problems were at highest risk of growth failure...|$|R
40|$|The {{microstructure}} {{and mechanical}} properties of niobium-modified {{lead zirconate titanate}} (PNZT) 95 / 5 ceramics, where 95 / 5 refers to the ratio of lead zirconate to lead titanate, were evaluated {{as a function of}} lead (Pb) stoichiometry. Chemically-prepared PNZT 95 / 5 is produced at Sandia National Laboratories by the Ceramics and Glass Processing Department (14154) for use as voltage elements in ferroelectric neutron generator power supplies. PNZT 95 / 5 was prepared according to the nominal formulation of Pb{sub 0. 991 +x}(Zr{sub 0. 955 }Ti{sub 0. 045 }) {sub 0. 982 }Nb{sub 0. 018 }O{sub 3 +x}, where x (- 0. 0274 {approx}< x {approx}< 0. 0297) refers to the mole fraction of Pb and O that deviated from the stoichiometric value. The Pb concentrations were determined from calcined powders; no adjustments were made to Pb compositions due to weight loss during sintering. The microstructure (second phases, fracture mode and grain size) varied appreciably with Pb stoichiometry, whereas the mechanical properties (hardness, fracture toughness, strength and Weibull parameters) exhibited modest variation. Specimens deficient in Pb, 2. 74 % (x = - 0. 0274) and 2. 15 % (x = - 0. 02150), had a high area fraction of a zirconia (ZrO{sub 2 }) second phase on the order of 0. 02. As the Pb content in solid solution increased the ZrO{sub 2 } content decreased; no ZrO{sub 2 } was observed for the specimen containing 2. 97 % excess Pb (x = 0. 0297). Over the range of Pb stoichiometry most specimens fractured predominately transgranularly; however, 2. 97 % Pb excess PNZT 95 / 5 fractured predominately intergranularly. No systematic changes in hardness or Weibull modulus were observed as a function of Pb content. Fracture toughness decreased slightly from 1. 8 MPa{center_dot}m{sup 1 / 2 } for Pb deficient specimens to 1. 6 MPa{center_dot}m{sup 1 / 2 } for specimens with excess Pb. Although there are microstructural differences with changes in Pb content, the mechanical properties did not vary substantially. However, the average failure stress and fracture toughness for PNZT 95 / 5 containing 2. 97 % excess Pb decreased slightly. It is expected that additional increases in Pb content would result in further mechanical property degradation. The decrease in mechanical properties for the 2. 97 % Pb excess ceramics <b>could</b> <b>be</b> the result of a weaker PbO-rich grain boundary phase present in the material. If better mechanical properties are desired, it is recommended that PNZT 95 / 5 ceramics are processed by a method whereby any excess Pb is depleted from the final sintered ceramic so that near-stoichiometric values of Pb concentration are reached. Otherwise, a PbO-rich grain boundary phase may exist in the ceramic which <b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> <b>be</b> <b>detrimental</b> to the mechanical properties of PNZT 95 / 5 ceramics...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of nonlinearities on {{the propagation of}} stress waves through soft tissues is currently an open research area. Understanding this influence could yield insights into the damage mechanisms of soft tissues in response to rapid and strong external excitations. In {{the context of this}} dissertation, soft tissues are idealized as nonlinear viscoelastic materials, and {{the focus is on the}} mechanical aspects of the tissue behavior. Two nonlinear material models are explored. One of them, a nonlinear extension of the standard solid viscoelastic model, is employed first to describe brain tissue behavior, and second, to study the interaction of blast pressure waves with viscoelastic systems. The second material model, obtained through a maximum dissipation, thermodynamically consistent construction, is employed for the studies of longitudinal wave propagation. In order to focus on the effects of the material nonlinearity, a geometrically fundamental model for longitudinal stress waves is employed. Theoretical studies including dispersion and asymptotic analyses are carried out in order to further the current understanding of wave propagation characteristics, such as the dependence of the wave speed and attenuation on the frequency, the effect of material dissipation, and the nonlinear steepening of wave fronts. Computational studies are carried out to examine various aspects of the nonlinear wave propagation. A unique nonlinear phenomenon related to the steepening of wave fronts is observed: the tissue absorbs energy in a localized fashion at the location of the moving steep wave front. This situation <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>potentially</b> <b>detrimental</b> to the tissue. Finally, the interplay between geometry (non [...] uniform cross [...] section) and material nonlinearity is studied. It is observed that a contracting cross [...] section promotes the development of much steeper stress wave fronts. The spatial location at which the steep wave front develops appears to be related to the elapsed time and the amplitude of the external load. Understanding this relationship could help establish a link between the location of the tissue damage and the external loading. This dissertation work can serve as a basis for better understanding the mechanical causes underlying mild traumatic brain injury, for example, as a consequence of head impact or explosive blast waves...|$|E
40|$|A perda de habitat é uma das principais causas que podem afectar a sobrevivência das limícolas (Aves: Charadrii) em muitos estuários da Europa. O {{principal}} objectivo deste estudo foi investigar os efeitos de alterações nos habitats das limícolas decorrentes da acção humana directa - a destruição de habitats supra-mareais (as salinas) - e indirecta - as exuberâncias ("blooms") periódicas de macroalgas nas vaseiras inter-mareais, consequência do processo de eutrofização em curso - num estuário submetido a intenso "stress ambiental", o estuário do Mondego. Desde 1984 que as salinas têm vindo a ser progressivamente abandonadas ou destruídas. Este estudo sugere que o desaparecimento deste habitat poderá representar uma sobrecarga de até 45 % no número de horas de alimentação. aves- 1 nas zonas de alimentação inter-mareais, que poderão revelar-se incapazes de albergar as aves para aí deslocados, especialmente se os níveis actuais de competição intra-específica forem já elevados. Esse efeito será amplificado se a alimentação nas áreas intermareais for afectada pelos "blooms" algais. O presente estudo não evidenciou níveis de competição intra-específicos suficientemente elevados para conduzir a um decréscimo das densidades de aves na zona inter-mareal; por outro lado não ficou demonstrado que as algas repelissem de alguma forma a alimentação das limícolas nas zonas por elas colonizadas. Como principal conclusão, pode inferir-se que, apesar da intensa pressão humana, a sobrevivência das populações de limícolas do estuário do Mondego não parece estar em risco imediato. Porém, a médio prazo, a destruição das salinas pode vir a afectar muitas espécies, devido à perda efectiva de tempo de alimentação, e a situação pode piorar ainda mais se for acompanhada por uma deterioração das condições alimentares nas vaseiras inter-mareais em virtude do crescimento incontrolável das áreas periodicamente afectadas pelos "blooms" algais, como consequência do processo de eutrofização acelerado que actualmente se verifica. Habitat loss is a {{major factor}} that can potentially affect the survival of wader populations (Aves: Charadrii) in many estuaries of Europe. A number of studies have been made on this subject in northern Europe, in the last two decades, but {{there is a lack of}} data regarding the southern half of the continent. The main objective of this thesis was to investigate what could be the short to medium–term effects on waders of changes in the estuarine habitats as a consequence of two important factors directly or indirectly attributable to human action in the Mondego estuary (west Portugal) : the loss of supra–tidal habitats (mainly salinas) and the increase of eutrophication in the mudflats, expressed as periodic ‘blooms’ of green macroalgae. The salinas are being abandoned and converted into fish-farms, which can not be used as feeding grounds by waders, at an alarming rate (5. 2 ha. year 1 in the the period 1984 – 94). Of about 305 ha of salinas in the estuary, 35 % have been deserted or drained, 23 % have been converted into fish-farms and only 42 % were still producing during the course of this study. The Mondego estuary still hold a numerous and diversified wader assemblage, which was particularly important in winter and during the spring and autumn migratory passages. It includes one species (Avocet, Recurvirostra avosetta) of international importance, according to the criterion of the Ramsar Convention (> 1 % of the flyway population in winter) and at least 8 species of national importance (> 1 % of the national winter numbers). Part of the birds that used the estuary throughout the year remained in the salinas both at low-tide (30 %) and at high-tide (58 %), and most of them feed there. The active salinas were clearly more used for feeding than the inactive ones, but these could still hold a number of birds for a long time (up to 20 years) after they have been abandoned, depending on the particular environmental conditions of each salina. An hypothetical destruction of the salinas would mean that the feeding would subsequently be restricted to the mudflats. According to the calculations developed in this study, such increase could reach up to 45 % of the birds–feeding hours that presently occur in the mudflats. However, not all species were likely to be affected in the same way by the loss of feeding opportunities in case the salinas were lost. Little Stint, Calidris minuta, Redshank Tringa totanus and Common Sandpiper Actitis hipoleucos would be the species more affected by the loss of space, while Turnstone Arenaria interpres and Dunlin Calidris alpina would be those more affected by the loss of feeding time at high–water. The predicted increase in the birds feeding–hours that would occur in the mudflats, if the salinas were to be destroyed, <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>potentially</b> <b>detrimental</b> for the survival of the estuarine populations of many species if the levels of inter-specific competition in the flats (which ultimately determine the carrying capacity of an area) were already high. The two tests used to assess the occurrence of interspecific competition (feeding interference among birds and depletion of the prey resources) suggested that the phenomenon was probably too weak to be perceived in the Mondego, at least with the methodology used. Thus, at present, the mudflats are probably still able to buffer the potential effects of the loss of space if the salinas were lost. However, the displaced birds would also lose feeding time, and this could not be recovered in the mudflats. The increasing process of eutrophication in the area may represent a direct threat to the mudflats, while feeding grounds for waders, through changes in the composition of the invertebrate communities and in the abundances of the main prey species. The present study did not present any evidence that the algae repelled the birds. Indeed, some species (e. g. Dunlin) may even have benefited of a surplus of food provided by the mats when they first appear, in early spring, but not in autumn, after the algal crash. This suggests that, at present, the occurrence of the algae on the flats do not represent an immediate threat to the waders’ feeding in the Mondego. Nevertheless, the situation can change in the long-term if the eutrophication process can not be reduced. The main conclusion of this study is that, in spite of the heavy human pressure in the estuary, the survival of the wader populations seems not to be threatened in the short–term. However, in the medium–term, the destruction of the salinas could seriously affect the survival of some species, and the situation could still become worse if it was accompanied by a global change in the composition of the prey communities caused by an increase of the eutrophication process in the estuary. Nevertheless, both these drastic alterations can still be prevented. Possible ways of achieving that in the salinas could be to find sustainable ways of keeping them actively producing, tomanage inactive ones in order tomake them suitable for waders, to carefully control the establishment of new fish-farms in old salinas, and to improve the design of the fish–ponds in order to provide waders with alternative feeding places to the destroyed salinas. As to the eutrophication process, any action to reduce it would have to be taken at a regional level, and would take more time. In any case, a long–term monitoring of the process at all levels of the trophic chain would be greatly welcome.

40|$|Thesis (M. A., Education (Multicultural Education)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2013. Statement of the Problem The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the factors that impact the participation of Latino parents in their school site???s English Language Advisory Committee (ELAC). Even though Latino, especially ELL, parents have tried through different school venues for decades to be included in the education of their children, there is still the unfortunate perception from many educators that Latino parents do not value nor prioritize education. All literature compiled in the study verify that Latino parents want and are enthusiastic to be included in the education of their children. Latino parents that have entered the education field have encountered many institutionalized, economic, social, and racial barriers that have prevented them from being active school parent participants. The Latino parents that are able to enter the institution do not only empower themselves, but ???seek to transform parent involvement with the goal of making education a democratic and reflective action??? (Olivos, p. 112, 2010). Sources of Data Personal observations, one-on-one interviews, a focus group meeting, and multiple recordings were conducted in an effort to find the specific factors that affect Latino parental involvement in ELAC. There were five (one father and four mothers) that were randomly selected of which all self-identified themselves as English language learners (ELL), Latino, active ELAC parent, and had at least one elementary (K ??? 6 th) child at the school site. Conclusions 	The results of the study confirm that Latino parents are and continue to be interested in the education of their children. All participating parents agreed ELAC served as an important bridge which influenced parent participation in American Schools in spite of the cultural and gender differences. Their participation in ELAC made them aware of the differences in their approach to schooling in M??xico in stark contrast to expectations to U. S. schools.

Furthermore, involvement in ELAC provide an environment for parents to become self-aware to the degree in which they themselves could start critiquing the varying levels of these differences they see among other Latino parents, as they lament over such low parent involvement. The decrease in parent involvement beyond second and third grade may be tied to premature autonomy parents present indirectly to their children. Finally they articulated, even with encouragement from school staff, the difficulty in crossing over to other parent school groups. They described feeling invisible and unheard.

40|$|International audienceThe {{assessment}} of overall customer satisfaction {{is an important}} issue in market research (Haumann et al. 2014, Homburg et al. 2014). After each online purchase, customers are asked to assess the product or service for which they have paid, usually on a five-point rating scales (e. g., Amazon, Trip Advisor). Comparable to bipolar scales, these tools are effective in making a distinction between polarized evaluations (i. e., either strong positivity or strong negativity). However, the literature on methodology reveals serious problems related to the mid-point displayed on these continuums (Kaplan 1972, Thompson et al. 1995). Actually, this mid-point inappropriately aggregates uncertain responses (difficult evaluation) with ambivalent (a combination of moderate to high positivity and negativity) or indifferent (low positivity and negativity) ones, when these different responses have been shown to reflect different attitudes and drive distinct behavioral responses (Yoo 2010, Thornton 2011). The Evaluative Space Grid (hereafter, ESG), developed in psychology by Larsen and colleagues (2009), could help address part of this methodological issue. The ESG comprises a 5 × 5 grid that measures both the degree of positivity of a stimulus and its degree of negativity within a bidimensional matrix. One dimension of the matrix is dedicated to the measurement of the respondent's degree of negativity ("not at all negative" - "extremely negative"), its degree of positivity ("not at all positive" - "extremely positive"). The combination of the two dimensions allows the respondent to choose which of the grid's 25 cells best describes its evaluation. The ESG has been validated in psychology with respect to unipolar measurement of positivity and negativity (Larsen et al. 2009). Applying the ESG in a service marketing context, Audrezet et al., (forthcoming) have recently demonstrated its relevance to measure overall customer satisfaction. Regarding the practical implementation of ESG, Larsen and colleagues (2009) formulate 2 -minute generic instructions before using the ESG, which include the presence of an experimenter to accompany the respondents in their task. However, they do not discuss {{the extent to which the}} grid <b>could</b> <b>be</b> easy to use in self-administered surveys. Based on a rapid qualitative study we assume that the ESG could hinder response task fluency, which could negatively affect response certainty (Regier et al. 2014). This, in turn, <b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> <b>be</b> very <b>detrimental</b> to market research as response certainty is a crucial determinant of data and prediction quality (Fazio and Zanna 1978, Antil 1983). The present article builds on previous research to investigate the influence of different formats of the ESG on response task fluency and certainty. To do so, an experiment specifically manipulating the ESG dimension and the presence of verbal labels in the cells was conducted on a sample of 105 undergraduate students. We demonstrate that the use of verbal labels, rather than a reduction in response alternatives, is a promising way to increase response task fluency and, in turn, improve individuals' response certainty. This work advocates for tool design reflection to create responding behavior incentives and reduce survey drop-out rates which is especially challenging within self-administered electronic settings...|$|R

This type of humor is {{characterized}} by the use of sarcasm, put-downs, teasing, criticism, ridicule, and other types of humor used at the expense of others. Aggressive humor often disregards the impact it might have on others. Prejudices such as racism and sexism are considered to be the aggressive style of humor. This type of humor may at times seem like playful fun, but sometimes the underlying intent is to harm or belittle others. Aggressive humor is related to higher levels of neuroticism and lower levels of agreeableness and conscientiousness.|$|R
