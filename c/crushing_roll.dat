40|$|Pressure feeder chutes are {{pieces of}} {{equipment}} used in sugar cane crushing {{to increase the amount}} of cane that can be put through a mill. The continuous pressure feeder was developed with the objective to provide a constant feed of bagasse under pressure to the mouth of the crushing mills. The pressure feeder chute is used in a sugarcane milling unit to transfer bagasse from one set of <b>crushing</b> <b>rolls</b> to a second set of <b>crushing</b> <b>rolls.</b> There have been many pressure feeder chute failures in the past. The pressure feeder chute is quite vulnerable and if the bagasse throughput is blocked at the mill rollers, the pressure build-up in the chute can be enormous, which can ultimately result in failure. The result is substantial damage to the rollers, mill and chute construction, and downtimes of up to 48 hours can be experienced. Part of the problem is that the bagasse behaviour in the pressure feeder chute is not understood well. If the pressure feeder chute behaviour was understood, then the chute geometry design could be modified in order to minimise risk of failure. There are possible avenues for changing pressure feeder chute design and operations with a view to producing more reliable pressure feeder chutes in the future. There have been previous attempts to conduct experimental work to determine the causes of pressure feeder chute failures. There are certain guidelines available, however pressure feeder chute failures continue. Pressure feeder chute behaviour still remains poorly understood. This thesis contains the work carried out between April 14 th 2009 and October 10 th 2012 that focuses on the design of an experimental apparatus to measure forces and visually observe bagasse behaviour in an attempt to understand bagasse behaviour in pressure feeder chutes and minimise the risk of failure...|$|R

40|$|An {{efficiency}} of the cutting method with outstripping plastic deformation (OPD) in lathe works is defined in many respects by design features of the add-on devices for mechanical hardening of a cut-off layer material {{in the course of}} cutting. Applied on lathes, deforming OPD devices can have differing dimensions, placement on the lathe, drive type (manual, electric, hydraulic, pneumatic, pneumohydraulic, electromagnetic), and autonomy degree towards the metalcutting equipment and industrial equipment. At the same time {{there are a number of}} inherent design features of work-hardening devices the modernized lathes with OPD use for machining. Now the OPD standard devices implement two principle construction options: loading device is placed on the machine or on the OPD slide support separate of the tool, or it is structurally aligned with the cutting tool. In the latter case the OPD device for turning is called a tool mandrel, which is mounted in a tool post of the machine or, at large dimensions, such a mandrel is mounted on the machine instead of the tool mandrel. When designing the OPD devices, is important to take into consideration production requirements and recommendations for the technological equipment, developed in the course of creation, working off and introduction of such installations for mechanical hardening of material. In compliance with it, OPD devices, their placement on the machine, and working displacements shouldn't limit technological capabilities of the applied metal-cutting equipment. OPD stresses have to be smoothly regulated, with maximum loads being limited to admissible values for the machine model to be modernized. It is necessary to ensure synchronized longitudinal and cross displacements of the cutting tool and OPD hardener with respect to the axis of billet rotation to enable regulation and readjustment of the hardener and tool placement. It ought to foresee the increased mobile components rigidity and manufacturing accuracy of a device to exclude unexpected displacements of hardener with respect to the surface of cutting. The article also gives main recommendations to choose design parameters of the <b>crush</b> <b>rolls</b> for OPD. Taking into consideration the above production requirements and recommendations to design the turning devices with OPD allows us to create technological equipment to provide high {{efficiency of}} a method. The equipment is convenient for work, simple and cheap in the production, available for repair and replacement of worn-out constructive components, and safe in operation as well. </p...|$|R

This load application is not representative of real-world loading rates of roof structures in a rollover collision. A series of tests comparing quasi-static roof loading versus dynamic roof loading was conducted to determine how static and dynamic tests can be correlated and if static test can be transformed to a dynamically equivalent result.

The breaking of individual particles is the most efficient comminution method because the energy losses owing to friction and unproductive tension in the instant of breakage are avoided.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In general, cold-cured {{flexible}} foams {{have a high}} {{content of}} closed cells during a foaming process because of a high reactivity of foaming components and curing at a low temperature. Cold-cured flexible foams require a mechanical method such as <b>roll</b> <b>crushing</b> or vacuum crushing to open a high content of closed cells for preventing shrinkage and cracking of foam after demolding. But this mechanical crushing process can yield foams with poor properties and reduce productivity on account of increasing costs for utilities, electricity, manpower and repair. A noncrushing foam system developed by Kumho Mitsui Chemicals Inc. (hereafter referred to as ‘‘KMCI’’) is a new cell opening technology that makes complete cell opening during the foaming process. Thus, this technology results in no shrinkage and cracking after demolding. In addition the noncrushing foam system makes possible manufacturing automotive seat cushions having an open cell structure and excellent cell stability compared to conventional foam by minimizing the degree of cross-linking density and increasing urea linkage. Our new technology {{has been used to}} make seat cushion at Hyundai Motor Company in Korea since 1999. We expect that the noncrushing foam system will be applied in various flexible foam applications and will contribute to improvement of productivity and seat cushion quality...|$|R
