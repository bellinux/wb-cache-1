A second track of wires provides a <b>clock</b> <b>track.</b> The card is read by pulling it through a slot in a reader device, which has a fixed magnetic field and a sensor coil. As each length of wire passes through the magnetic field, its magnetic state flips, which indicates a 1, and this is sensed by the coil. The absence of a wire indicates a 0. The resulting Wiegand protocol digital code is then sent to a host controller to determine whether to electrically unlock the door.|$|E

5000|$|The {{design of}} DECtape and its {{controllers}} {{is quite different}} from any other type of tape drive or controller at the time. The tape is 0.75 in wide, accommodating 6 data tracks, 2 mark tracks, and 2 clock tracks, with data recorded at roughly 350 bits per inch (138 bits per cm). Each track is paired with a non-adjacent track for redundancy by wiring the tape heads in parallel; as a result the electronics only deal with 5 tracks: a <b>clock</b> <b>track,</b> a mark track and 3 data tracks. Manchester encoding (PE) was used. The clock and mark tracks are written only once, when the tape was formatted; after that, they are read-only. This meant a [...] "drop-out" [...] on one channel could be tolerated; even a hole punched through the tape with a 0.25 in hole punch will not cause the read to fail.|$|E

40|$|The Fanout {{system is}} part of the Silicon Vertex Tracker (SVT), a new trigger {{processor}} designed to reconstruct charged particle trajectories at level 2 (L 2) of the CDF trigger, with a latency of 10 mus and an event rate up to 100 kHz. The core of SVT is organized as 12 identical slices, which process in parallel the data from the 12 independent azimuthal wedges of the Silicon Vertex Detector (SVXII). Each SVT slice links the digitized pulse heights found within one SVXII wedge to the tracks reconstructed by the level I (L 1) fast track finder (XFT) in the corresponding 301 angular region of the Central Outer Tracker (COT). Since the XFT tracks are transmitted to SVT as a single data stream, their distribution to the proper SVT slices requires dedicated fanout logic. The fanout system has been implemented as a multiboard project running on a common 20 -MHz <b>clock.</b> <b>Track</b> fanout is performed in two steps by one "Fanout A" and two "Fanout B" boards.

40|$|Clock {{synchronization}} is one {{of fundamental}} requirements in distributed networks. However, the imperfection of crystal oscillators is a potential hurdle for network-wide collaboration and degrades the performance of cooperative applications. Since clock discrepancy among nodes is inevitable, many software and hardware attempts have been introduced to meet synchronization requirements. Most of the attempts are built on communication protocols that demand timestamp exchanges to improve synchronization accuracy or resource efficiency. However, link delay and environmental changes sometimes impede these synchronization efforts that achieve in desired accuracy. First, the clock synchronization problem was examined in networks where nodes lack the high accuracy oscillators or programmable network interfaces some previous protocols depend on. Next, a stochastic and practical clock model was developed by using information criteria which followed the principle of Occam's razor. The model was optimized {{in terms of the}} number of parameters. Simulation by using real measurements on low-powered micro-controllers validated the derived clock model. Last, based on the model, a <b>clock</b> <b>tracking</b> algorithm was proposed to achieve high synchronization accuracy between unstable clocks. This algorithm employed the Kalman filter to <b>track</b> <b>clock</b> offset and skew. Extensive simulations demonstrated that the proposed synchronization algorithm not only could follow the clock uncertainties shown in real measurements but also was tolerant to corrupted timestamp deliveries. Clock oscillators are vulnerable to noises and environmental changes. As a second approach, clock estimation technique that took circumstances into consideration was proposed. Through experiments on mobile devices, the obstacles were clarified in synchronization over wireless networks. While the causes of clock inaccuracy were focused on, the effect of environmental changes on clock drifting was investigated. The analysis of the observations inspired an M-estimator of clock error that was accurate but under dominant disturbances such as oscillator instability and random network delay. A Kalman filter was designed to compensate with temperature changes and estimate clock offset and skew. The proposed temperature-compensated Kalman filter achieved the better estimates of clock offset and skew by adjusting frequency shifts caused by temperature changes. The proposed Kalman filter-based clock synchronization was implemented in C. A real-time operation was proved by <b>clock</b> <b>tracking</b> between two mobile platforms that the synchronization technique was implemented on. Moreover, the technique was converted to fixed-point algorithm, which might degrade performance, to evaluate the synchronizing operation on fixed-point processors. The fixed-point simulation reported performance degradation caused by limited hardware resources; however, it also corroborated the applicability of the synchronization technique. Ph. D...|$|R
