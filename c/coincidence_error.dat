40|$|A {{particle}} counting instrument, the Coherent Optical Particle Spectrometer (COPS) {{has been developed}} for measuring particles in aerosol systems. It optically counts and sizes single particles {{one at a time}} as they pass through an optically defined inspection region so particle size distributions can be directly measured. COPS uses the coherent nature of light available in a laser beam to measure the phase shift in the scattered light, which is fundamentally different from previous intensity based techniques. The Van-Cittert-Zernike theorem shows that scattered light from small particles will be coherent if viewed upon at the focal point of a gathering lens. Optical homodyne detection can then be used to measure the extent of the phase shift due to the particle. Scattering mechanisms can relate the phase shift to particle diameter so particle size can be determined. An optical inspection region is given by the resolution limited blur spot diameter and depth of focus of the gathering lens. Particles scattering outside this zone will not contribute to measured phase signals. Calculations show that COPS can count in concentrations of 10 (' 9) particles per cubic centimeter with 5 % <b>coincidence</b> <b>error.</b> Mie scattering calculations, coupled with homodyne theory, predict a minimum detectable particle diameter ranging from 0. 03 to 0. 3 micrometers, depending on optical configuration. Theory shows that small, strongly absorbing particles impart a much larger phase shift than refractive particles so a lower detection limit is predicted for particles such as soot and silicon. Particles above one micrometer show classic resonance typical of Mie calculations. An experimental COPS system verified the predicted results from the model. Resolution of particle size ranged from 25 to 60 percent of particle diameter. Preliminary experiments showed that COPS has in situ sampling possibilities and will work for liquid systems as well. Coherent detection of scattered light shows promise for in situ measurement of submicrometer aerosols in high particle laden streams with maximum sensitivity for strongly absorbing particles...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAltitude {{profiles}} of ClONO 2 retrieved with the IMK (Institut für Meteorologie und Klimaforschung) science-oriented data processor from MIPAS/Envisat (Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding on Envisat) mid-infrared limb emission measurements between July 2002 and March 2004 have been validated {{by comparison with}} balloon-borne (Mark IV, FIRS 2, MIPAS-B), airborne (MIPAS-STR), ground-based (Spitsbergen, Thule, Kiruna, Harestua, Jungfraujoch, Izaña, Wollongong, Lauder), and spaceborne (ACE-FTS) observations. With few exceptions we found very good agreement between these instruments and MIPAS with no evidence for any bias in most cases and altitude regions. For balloon-borne measurements typical absolute mean differences are below 0. 05 ppbv over the whole altitude range from 10 to 39 km. In case of ACE-FTS observations mean differences are below 0. 03 ppbv for observations below 26 km. Above this altitude the comparison with ACE-FTS {{is affected by the}} photochemically induced diurnal variation of ClONO 2. Correction for this by use of a chemical transport model led to an overcompensation of the photochemical effect by up to 0. 1 ppbv at altitudes of 30 ? 35 km in case of MIPAS-ACE-FTS comparisons while for the balloon-borne observations no such inconsistency has been detected. The comparison of MIPAS derived total column amounts with ground-based observations revealed no significant bias in the MIPAS data. Mean differences between MIPAS and FTIR column abundances are 0. 11 ± 0. 12 × 10 14 cm ? 2 (1. 0 ± 1. 1 %) and ? 0. 09 ± 0. 19 × 10 14 cm ? 2 (? 0. 8 ± 1. 7 %), depending on the coincidence criterion applied. ? 2 tests have been performed to assess the combined precision estimates of MIPAS and the related instruments.

To address this shortcoming, a generalization of the complete data fusion method, which takes into account interpolation and <b>coincidence</b> <b>errors,</b> is presented. This upgrade overcomes the encountered problems and provides products of good quality when the fusing profiles are both retrieved on different vertical grids and referred to different true profiles. The impact of the interpolation and <b>coincidence</b> <b>errors</b> on number of degrees of freedom and errors of the fused profile is also analyzed.

40|$|Laboratory {{calibrations}} of the Cloud Droplet Probe (CDP) sample {{area and}} droplet sizing are performed using water droplets of known size, generated at a known rate. Although calibrations with PSL and glass beads {{were consistent with}} theoretical instrument response, liquid water droplet calibrations were not, and necessitated a 2 μm shift in the manufacturer's calibration. We show that much of this response shift may be attributable to a misalignment of the optics relative to the axis of the laser beam. Comparison with an independent measure of liquid water content (LWC) during in-flight operation suggests much greater biases in the droplet size and/or droplet concentration measured by the CDP than would be expected based on the laboratory calibrations. Since the bias in CDP-LWC is strongly concentration dependent, we hypothesize that this discrepancy {{is a result of}} coincidence, when two or more droplets pass through the CDP laser beam within a very short time. The <b>coincidence</b> <b>error,</b> most frequently resulting from the passage of one droplet outside and one inside the instrument sample area at the same time, is evaluated in terms of an "extended sample area" (SAE), the area in which individual droplets can affect the sizing detector without necessarily registering on the qualifier. SAE is calibrated with standardized water droplets, and used in a Monte-Carlo simulation to estimate the effect of coincidence on the measured droplet size distributions. The simulations show that extended coincidence errors are important for the CDP at droplet concentrations even as low as 200 cm− 3 , and these errors are necessary to explain the trend between calculated and measured LWC observed in liquid and mixed-phase clouds during the Aerosol, Radiation and Cloud Processes Affecting Arctic Climate (ARCPAC) study. We estimate from the simulations that 60 % oversizing error and 50 % undercounting error can occur at droplet concentrations exceeding 400 cm− 3 . Modification of the optical design of the CDP is currently being explored in an effort to reduce this coincidence bias...|$|E

The product version 4. 61 / 4. 62 for the observation period between July 2002 and March 2004 is validated by comparisons with a number of independent observations from ground-based stations, aircraft/balloon campaigns, and satellites. Individual HNO 3 profiles of the ESA MIPAS level- 2 product show good agreement with those of MIPAS-B and MIPAS-STR (the balloon and aircraft version of MIPAS, respectively), and the balloon-borne infrared spectrometers MkIV and SPIRALE, mostly matching the reference data within the combined instrument error bars. In most cases differences between the correlative measurement pairs are less than 1 ppbv (5 – 10 %) throughout the entire altitude range up to about 38 km (~ 6 hPa), and below 0. 5 ppbv (15 – 20 % or more) above 30 km (~ 17 hPa). However, differences up to 4 ppbv compared to MkIV have been found at high latitudes in December 2002 in the presence of polar stratospheric clouds. The degree of consistency is further largely affected by the temporal and spatial coincidence, and differences of 2 ppbv may be observed between 22 and 26 km (~ 50 and 30 hPa) at high latitudes near the vortex boundary, due to large horizontal inhomogeneity of HNO 3. Similar features are also observed in the mean differences of the MIPAS ESA HNO 3 VMRs with respect to the ground-based FTIR measurements at five stations, aircraft-based SAFIRE-A and ASUR, and the balloon campaign IBEX. The mean relative differences between the MIPAS and FTIR HNO 3 partial columns are within ± 2 %, comparable to the MIPAS systematic error of ~ 2 %. For the vertical profiles, the biases between the MIPAS and FTIR data are generally below 10 % in the altitudes of 10 to 30 km. The MIPAS and SAFIRE HNO 3 data generally match within their total error bars for the mid and high latitude flights, despite the larger atmospheric inhomogeneities that characterize the measurement scenario at higher latitudes. The MIPAS and ASUR comparison reveals generally good agreements better than 10 – 13 % at 20 – 34 km. The MIPAS and IBEX measurements agree reasonably well (mean relative differences within ± 15 %) between 17 and 32 km. Statistical comparisons of the MIPAS profiles correlated with those of Odin/SMR, ILAS-II, and ACE-FTS generally show good consistency.

40|$|Abstract. Recent {{findings}} {{in the domain of}} combining classifiers provide a surprising revision of the usefulness of diversity for modelling combined performance. Although there is a common agreement that a successful fusion system should be composed of accurate and diverse classifiers, experimental results show very weak correlations between various diversity measures and combining methods. Effectively neither the combined performance nor its improvement against mean classifier performance seem to be measurable in a consistent and well defined manner. At the same time the most successful diversity measures, barely regarded as measuring diversity, are based on measuring <b>error</b> <b>coincidences</b> and by doing so they move closer to the definitions of combined errors themselves. Following this trend we decided to use directly the combining error normalized within the derivable error limits as a measure of classifiers dependency. Taking into account its simplicity and representativeness we chose majority voting error for the construction of the measure. We examine this novel dependency measure for a number of real datasets and classifiers showing its ability to model combining improvements over an individual mean. 1...|$|R
40|$|Quantum key {{distribution}} (QKD), a novel cryptographic technique for secure distribution of secret keys between two parties, {{is the first}} successful quantum technology to emerge from quantum information science. The security of QKD is guaranteed by fundamental properties of quantum mechanical systems, unlike public-key cryptography whose security depends on difficult to solve mathematical problems such as factoring. Current terrestrial quantum links are limited to about 250 km. However, QKD could soon be deployed {{on a global scale}} over free-space links to an orbiting satellite used as a trusted node. Envisioning a photonic uplink to a quantum receiver positioned on a low Earth orbit satellite, the Canadian Quantum Encryption and Science Satellite (QEYSSat) is a collaborative project involving Canadian universities, the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and industry partners. This thesis presents some of the research conducted towards feasibility studies of the QEYSSat mission. One of the main goals of this research is to develop technologies for data acquisition and processing required for a satellite-based QKD system. A working testbed system helps to establish firmly grounded estimates of the overall complexity, the computing resources necessary, and the bandwidth requirements of the classical communication channel. It can also serve as a good foundation for the design and development of a future payload computer onboard QEYSSat. This thesis describes the design and implementation of a QKD post-processing system which aims to minimize the computing requirements at one side of the link, unlike most traditional implementations which assume symmetric computing resources at each end. The post-processing software features precise <b>coincidence</b> analysis, <b>error</b> correction based on low-density parity-check codes, privacy amplification employing Toeplitz hash functions, and a procedure for automated polarization alignment.

While the first Royal Commission considered the likelihood that the code phrase [...] "foxtrot corpen" [...] was reversed to become [...] "corpen foxtrot" [...] (an order to turn onto the given course), Frame states that it was more likely that the numbers given for the course were misheard or confused with other numbers in the signal as a turn to the south-west (various possibilities offered by Frame would have indicated a turn to the south-west instead of the north-east, with an incorrect heading between 200° and 220°, or of 270°), or that this happened in conjunction with the code phrase error.

We found that verdicts were sensitive to the strength of DNA evidence regardless of how the expert explained it, but verdicts were sensitive to the strength of shoeprint evidence only when the expert used RMPs. The weight given to DNA evidence was consistent with the predictions of a Bayesian network model that incorporated the perceived risk of a false match from 3 causes (<b>coincidence,</b> a laboratory <b>error,</b> and a frame-up), but shoeprint evidence was undervalued relative to the same Bayesian model. Fallacious interpretations of the expert’s testimony (consistent with the source probability error and the defense attorney’s fallacy) were common and were associated with the weight given to the evidence and verdicts. The findings indicate that perceptions of forensic science evidence are shaped by prior beliefs and expectations as well as expert testimony and consequently that the best way to characterize and explain forensic evidence may vary across forensic disciplines.
