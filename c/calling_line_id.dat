50|$|With cellphones, {{the biggest}} issue {{appears to be in}} the passing of <b>calling</b> <b>line</b> <b>ID</b> {{information}} through the network. Cellphone companies must support interconnecting trunks to a significant number of Wireline and PSTN access carriers.|$|E
50|$|A call placed {{behind a}} private branch {{exchange}} (PBX) has more options. In the typical telephony environment, a PBX connects to the local service provider through Primary Rate Interface (PRI) trunks. Generally, although not absolutely, the service provider simply passes whatever <b>calling</b> <b>line</b> <b>ID</b> appears on those PRI access trunks transparently across the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). This opens up the opportunity for the PBX administrator to program whatever number they choose in their external phone number fields.|$|E
5000|$|Some IP phone {{services}} (ITSPs, or Internet Telephony Service Providers) support PSTN gateway installations {{throughout the}} world. These gateways egress {{calls to the}} local calling area, thus avoiding long distance toll charges. ITSPs also allow a local user to have a number located in a [...] "foreign" [...] exchange; the New York caller could have a Los Angeles number, for example. When that user places a call, the <b>calling</b> <b>line</b> <b>ID</b> would be that of a Los Angeles number, although they are actually located in New York. This allows a call return without having to incur long distance calling charges.|$|E

30|$|Electric energy {{consumption}} {{is measured in}} W ⋅ h (Watt × Hour).

Assuming that electrical potential, measured in V is standardized in Trentino province (thus is equal for all <b>line</b> <b>IDs)</b> and given the same timeframes for the analysis, the electric {{energy consumption}} prediction task reduces to predicting electric current measured in Ampere per each time frame per each <b>line</b> <b>ID.</b> The values in Ampere of the current passing through the given power line are given by the electric energy distribution company.|$|R

40|$|Background: Time-dependent {{chemotherapeutic}} agents can selectively target {{tumor cells}} in susceptible {{phases of the}} cell cycle however a fraction of tumor cells in non-vulnerable cell cycle phases remain drug-resistant. Immunotherapy represents a promising approach to overcome the limitation of phase-specific drugs and improve their clinical efficacy. Here, we investigated the potential use of anticancer chemotherapeutic drugs in combination with IL- 18, a cytokine with strong immunostimulatory properties. Methods: Four chemotherapeutic drugs commonly used in ovarian cancer were first {{tested for the ability}} to increase the immunogenicity and killing of the murine ovarian cancer cell <b>line</b> <b>ID</b> 8 in vitro. Chemotherapeutric agents with measured time-dependent immune-enhancing effects were then tested for antitumor effectiveness in vivo in combination with IL- 18 immunotherapy using the ID 8 -Vegf ovarian cancer model. Results: Paclitaxel or topotecan exposure alone mediated incomplete, time-dependent killing against the murine ovarian cancer cell <b>line</b> <b>ID</b> 8 in vitro, whereas carboplatin or gemcitabine mediated comprehensive, dose-dependent killing. In the plateau phase of the time-dependent killing by topotecan or paclitaxel, drug-resistant ID 8 cells were more immunogenic with elevated expression of MHC-I and Fas, and increased sensitivity to CTL and Fas agonistic antibody in vitro. Moreover, the antitumor effectiveness of time-dependent agents in vivo was significantl...|$|R

Moreover, the antitumor effectiveness of time-dependent agents in vivo was significantly improved with the addition of IL- 18 through a T cell-dependent mechanism, while the effectiveness of drugs without significant phase specificity were not. Conclusions Tumor immunotherapy with IL- 18 can significantly augment the killing fraction of phase-specific chemotherapeutic drugs and provide survival benefit. The safety profile of IL- 18 and its positive interactions with select anticancer chemotherapeutic agents strongly supports the clinical investigation of this combinatorial approach. </p...|$|R
