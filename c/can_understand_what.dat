25|$|Thematically, moral {{ambiguity}} is {{a prominent}} feature of Brian's work. Extreme cases of loyalty and antagonism are personified in characters such as Noelle Lange and Ivy Slade—to degrees that are sometimes questioned or denounced by the narrator. However, {{it is often}} only after the details of another character's background have been revealed that Brennan <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> motivates them, which will occasionally leave her conflicted in her judgments. The series has companion works, set {{in the past and}} the future, which are dedicated to further exploring character. These novels include the Private prequel collection, which focuses on various figures, and the spin-off series Privilege, which follows the resourceful but disturbed Ariana Osgood.|$|E
25|$|A {{little girl}} {{introduced}} in volume 4, Nirvana {{is not all}} she appears to be. She is Indian and is first seen as a child who Ah-Gi has taken to kill and make into food. Bi-Ryu and Ah-Rin show up {{just in time to}} save her, though she shows no fear towards the man. He believes her to be a mute, as she has not spoken since he abducted her. Later, after meeting Bi Ryu's Party she speaks slowly with future predictions, accurately predicting Yhun Ah-Rin kicking Bi Ryu. It is also known that she apparently is wanted, as a group of assassins intrude upon Bi-Ryu's party and attempt to kill them to take Nirvana. She seems to like Cho Ryung, as she hugs her like a stuffed animal a lot (She's also the only one who <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> Cho Ryung says). She carries the memory of the former heads of Myung Wong Shin Gyo, Parvati.|$|E

During the incident at Centra, he loses his voice in a battle with Esthar soldiers. After being separated from Laguna and Kiros, he becomes a janitor at the D-District Prison. When Laguna becomes president of Esthar, Ward joins Kiros as an advisor, directing affairs with gestures and ellipses. Laguna and Kiros <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> he is saying by his reactions. Like Kiros, Ward's interactions with Laguna {{are based on the}} staff's interactions during development.|$|E

500|$|Although Tony Hutchinson (Nick Pickard) {{was in a}} {{relationship}} with Mercedes' sister, Jacqui (Claire Cooper), he and Mercedes had sex. Metcalfe explained this was because Mercedes was intoxicated and unaware of her actions, [...] "but she was also furious at Jacqui for giving her a slap". Metcalfe explained that when Mercedes woke up, she was in disbelief about the events of the previous night and felt [...] "appalled". She added that Mercedes did not fancy Tony and that they did not even like each other, which was why [...] "neither of them <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> happened between them". Regarding Mercedes' feelings about hurting Jacqui, Metcalfe stated: [...] "Mercedes hates herself for it. She feels incredibly guilty and ashamed of what she's done. It's surprising Jacqui doesn't guess something is wrong because Mercedes can't look her in the eye".|$|E
500|$|In {{the fourth}} book, The Blazing Star, rogues (non-Clan cats) join the groups and One Eye, a rogue {{tries to take}} control of the forest. The groups meet again at the full moon, where they are greeted again by the fallen cats. This time, they bring a new message: [...] "To tame the Claw that blights the forest, grow and spread like the Blazing Star". No cat <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> it means; however, during the meeting, Thunder meets a she-cat named Star Flower. Then to realise she is One Eye's daughter. After the meeting, the cats notice that a strange {{sickness}} is starting to infect the prey, giving them sores and bloated bellies.

500|$|In {{the lead}} up to the {{publication}} date, at a panel event at the New York Comic Con, Jensen was asked by a fan holding a [...] "plush Anarky doll" [...] what the character's role {{would be in the}} story. Jensen explained that Anarky [...] "would have a very big hand" [...] in the story, and further explained, [...] "you <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> he's doing even if you don't agree with what he's doing." [...] Jensen had also indicated that his version of Anarky would be a [...] "fresh take that also honors his legacy." [...] The story featured a character study of John Stewart, narrating Stewart's final mission as a young Marine {{in the midst of a}} Gotham City power blackout and citywide evacuation, mere days before a major storm is to hit the city. Anarky is depicted as rallying a group of followers and evacuees to occupy a sports stadium, on the basis that the area the stadium was built upon was gentrified at the expense of the local community and should be returned to them. The storyline brought two particular additions to the revamped version of Anarky; the first being that this new version of Anarky is portrayed as an African American; the second being to preserve the character's anonymity, as Anarky escapes custody at the end of the story without an identity behind the mask being revealed.|$|E

After Ronald Reagan became president, {{and after the}} attempt on his life on March 30, 1981, Nancy asked Quigley {{if she could have}} foreseen, and {{possibly}} prevented, the assassination attempt. Quigley answered affirmatively, saying that she could have done so had she been looking at the time. At that point, Nancy Reagan enlisted Quigley's astrological advice on a regular basis, and held frequent telephone conversations with Quigley. Explaining why she turned to Quigley, Nancy later wrote, [...] "Very few people <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> it's like to have your husband shot at and almost die, and then have him exposed all the time to enormous crowds, tens of thousands of people, any one of whom might be a lunatic with a gun....

2500|$|More recently, the {{intelligent}} design movement has attempted an anti-evolution position that avoids any direct appeal to religion. Scientists argue that intelligent design is pseudoscience {{and does not}} represent any research program within the mainstream scientific community, and is still essentially creationism. Its leading proponent, the Discovery Institute, made widely publicised claims {{that it was a}} new science, although the only paper arguing for it published in a scientific journal was accepted in questionable circumstances and quickly disavowed in the Sternberg peer review controversy, with the Biological Society of Washington stating that it did not meet the journal's scientific standards, was a [...] "significant departure" [...] from the journal's normal subject area and was published at the former editor's sole discretion, [...] "contrary to typical editorial practices."

2500|$|In 1907, Cobb reached {{first and}} then stole second, third and home. He {{accomplished}} the feat four more times during his career.

At age 20, he was the youngest player to win a batting championship and held this record until 1955, when fellow Detroit Tiger Al Kaline won the batting title twelve days younger than Cobb when he did it. Reflecting on his career in 1930, two years after retiring, he told Grantland Rice, [...] "The biggest thrill I ever got came {{in a game against}} the Athletics in 1907 ... The Athletics had us beaten, with Rube Waddell pitching. [...] They were two runs ahead in the 9th inning, when I happened to hit a home run that tied the score.
