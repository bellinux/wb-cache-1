40|$|<b>Cadmium</b> <b>Tungstate</b> is {{a common}} {{scintillator}} crystal used {{in a variety of}} commercial and scientific applications. Its relative high density allows for adequate radiation hardness and its low hygroscopicity permits its use at room temperature in harsh environments without the need of moisture protection. The ideal scintillator material is NaI:Tl which is referred as a standard at 100 % Charge Collection Efficiency (CCE), but its relative low density and susceptibility to moisture makes its application limited. <b>Cadmium</b> <b>Tungstate</b> efficiency is 30 % of NaI:Tl and its radiation damage inhibits peak light output of an additional 40 %. The {{purpose of this study was}} to understand the characteristics of this reduced efficiency and determine the crystal behaviors under doping conditions of metal ions to increase its peak light output and its resistance to radiation. The use of Combinatorial Materials research was instrumental in segregating thousands of compositions to obtain a stoichiometric balance, which permitted for growth of single crystals. The first step was the preparation of sintered compositions which underwent measurements in a dual system of X-Ray Diffraction and X-Ray Fluorescence to determine the best compositions for increased light output. The second step was to irradiate the corresponding sintered samples under a strong X-Ray flux to determine its radiation damage. Ideally, the best results are determined by a combination of high light output and increased resistance to irradiation damage. The optimized compositions were grown into single crystals according to the Czochralski method and their peak light output measured.

Different types of photomultipliers (ordinary and time-gated) {{as well as an}} avalanche photodiode were tested and compared using the phosphorescence decay time of <b>cadmium</b> <b>tungstate</b> (CdWO 4). Effects originating from incipient detector saturation are revealed as a change in evaluated phosphorescence decay time, which was found to be a more sensitive measure for saturation than the conventional signal strength comparison between in- and output. Since the decay time of thermographic phosphors is used for temperature determination systematic temperature errors in the order of several tens of Kelvins may be introduced. Saturation from the initial intensity is isolated from temporally developed saturation by varying the CdWO 4 decay time over the microsecond to nanosecond range, resultant of varying the temperature from 290 to 580 K. A detector mapping procedure is developed in order to identify linear response regions where the decay-to-temperature evaluations are unbiased. In addition, this mapping procedure generates a library of the degree of distortion for operating points outside of linear response regions.
