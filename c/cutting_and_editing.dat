5000|$|Throughout production, The Land Before Time {{underwent}} a severe <b>cutting</b> <b>and</b> <b>editing</b> of footage.

Spielberg told Bluth while looking at the scenes from the film, [...] "It's too scary. We'll have kids crying in the lobby, {{and a lot of}} angry parents. You don't want that." [...] About 10 minutes of footage, comprising a total of 19 fully animated scenes, were cut from the final film, to attain a G rating instead of a PG rating. Much of the cut footage consisted of the Tyrannosaurus attack sequence and sequences of the five young dinosaurs in grave danger and distress. Examples {{can be seen in the}} storyboards of the chase sequence in the briar patch. POV shots of Sharptooth's snapping jaws were deleted, and shots were rearranged to shorten the sequence. This results in continuity errors, depicting the Tyrannosaur with his right eye still open after it had been blinded. Some screams were re-voiced using milder exclamations.|$|E

50|$|Had {{the motion}} picture been a product which demanded {{uniformity}} as its ultimate goal, the results would have been highly satisfactory. But unfortunately it was, and is, a combination of mechanical perfection and creative endeavor. And in applying the mass-production yardstick to both the mechanics and creative side of film-making, the latter became molded into a pattern. The efforts and achievements of the individual producers and directors had {{to meet with the}} approval of each studio's chief executive.… Producers and directors working under him found that instead of creating as they pleased, letting their own imagination and artistry have full rein, with the public the final judge of the worth and merit of their efforts, they were of necessity obliged to make pictures for the approval of the one man at the top. Thus the creative side of film-making, from the selection of the story, the writers who would put it into script form, the casting of the players, the designing of their costumes and the sets which provided their backgrounds, the direction, the <b>cutting</b> <b>and</b> <b>editing</b> of the final film was tailored (consciously or unconsciously) to the tastes of the studio's head man.|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{we explore}} how {{traveling}} relates to image production and how transcultural filmic representations both uphold and are sustained by a "coloniality of seeing. " We {{pay special attention}} to the historical conditions of film making in an expedition context and the expectations associated with early film in Sweden. We discuss this through the study of the documentary film Following Indian Trails by the Pilcomayo River, which was recorded during a Swedish expedition to the Argentine Chaco in 1920 and later released in Stockholm in 1950 during a private screening organized by the Swedish Chaco Travellers Association. We argue that the film presents an account inspired by classic ethnography which rescues and puts into circulation images of indigenous people from the "impenetrable" and "savage" Chaco. The ethnographic emphasis in the narrative seems to have shifted with time as it was probably only partly present during the shooting of the footage. In the narrative mode of "monstration," when bodies meet machines "in the field," native performances are presented as an "unstaged" and realist spectacle. Later in the 1950 "macro-narration," encompassing the final <b>cutting</b> <b>and</b> <b>editing</b> of the original footage, fragments of spectacle are systematized into an ethnographic description of primitive life.

40|$|The {{plays of}} William Shakespeare {{have long been}} {{considered}} a source of cultural and educational interest by both academics and filmmakers, {{and the practice of}} adapting Shakespeare’s works to film has existed for almost as long as film itself. The name “Shakespeare” evokes ideals of cultural legitimacy and importance, and Shakespeare film as a genre is always caught up in questions of fidelity and legitimacy. In adapting Shakespeare to the screen, filmmakers also adapt, whether deliberately or not, the various cultural beliefs that his work is steeped in. Early modern ideas about gender, race and class are reproduced in modern film through the adaptation of Shakespeare, often excused or unexamined in the name of fidelity. This thesis discusses Shakespeare’s three plays Hamlet, Richard III and The Taming of the Shrew, all of which deal in some way with gender roles and the place and power of women, whether that power is sexual, political or verbal. I also examine three film adaptations of the plays: Kenneth Branagh’s Hamlet, Ian McKellen and Richard Loncraine’s Richard III, and Gil Junger’s 10 Things I Hate About You. All three films serve as examples of the way the misogyny present in Shakespeare’s works is reproduced and sometimes magnified through adaptation to the screen. The reproduction of early modern gender hierarchies is naturalised {{in a number of ways}} across the three films, including the use of star power, the invocation of Shakespeare as a cultural authority, and specific filmic techniques such as flashback and the <b>cutting</b> <b>and</b> <b>editing</b> of film and screenplay. I argue that in all three films, the faithful adaptation of Shakespearean ideas of gender comes at the expense of both the women characters and those women who make up the films’ audience...|$|E
