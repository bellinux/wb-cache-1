5|$|The {{history of}} Highway3 dates back over 200 {{years to the}} {{pioneering}} settlement era of Upper Canada following the American Revolution and the resulting influx of United Empire Loyalists. Thomas Talbot, an influential scion who joined the British army {{at the age of}} 11, would challenge the government, the terrain, and the forces of nature {{to see to it that}} his road be built. Due to his family legacy, Talbot worked through the ranks quickly and found himself a personal aide to John Graves Simcoe, the first Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada. He returned to England after Simcoe fell ill, but vowed to return to the hinterland he had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>love.</b>|$|E
5|$|I {{should say}} I {{wanted to write}} poetry in the {{beginning}} because I {{had fallen in love}} with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E

Having become the Sakurazukamori, Seishirō was supposed to kill the young Subaru when being found by him.

500|$|The {{episode was}} met with mixed {{response}} from critics. Robert Bianco of USA Today found it lacking in plot and a driving moral, however {{felt that it was}} acceptable as a standalone episode – one which could be enjoyed by fans and new viewers alike. In contrast, Vicki Hyman of The Star-Ledger commented that despite the football-centric plot, the episode would be hard to follow for new viewers brought in by the Super Bowl, requiring too much knowledge of previous storylines. New York Willa Paskin felt that Murphy demonstrated [...] "utter contempt" [...] for the potential new audience. She suggested that the McKinley High football team were used as a metaphor for new viewers—who could <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> Glee if they embraced its musical numbers—but found this insulting as the team are portrayed as being ignorant and intolerant. Kevin Fallon of The Atlantic found the episode lacking in Glee [...] "usual acerbic wit and emotional heft", and criticized the under-use of Colfer and Criss.|$|E
500|$|Anthony Addabbo {{temporarily}} {{took over}} the role, first airing on April 6, 2001. To prepare for the role, he watched tapes of Nader's portrayal of Dimitri {{in order to see}} the relationships between Dimitri and other characters. Despite the fan protest against the role being recast, Addabbo told Soap Opera Digest he was not worried. [...] "I don't find it intimidating," [...] he said. [...] "I know how they can <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> a certain actor portraying a role and how he plays the role and everything, but this happens in daytime so frequently that I didn't find it intimidating at all." [...] Soap Opera Digest considered him an odd choice for a Dimitri recast since Addabbo usually portrayed [...] "all-American good guys" [...] such as Generations Jason Craig and Guiding Lights Jim LeMay. A large number of All My Children fans rejected Addabbo in the role and continued to campaign for Nader's return. The controversy forced the writers to lessen Dimitri's role on the show until July 2001 when Addabbo was let go [...] "for storyline reasons", according to ABC's official statement.|$|E

500|$|Miyazaki {{stated that}} an {{attractive}} {{aspect of the}} story of Howl's Moving Castle was the relatively positive light it shed on growing old. When Sophie becomes old {{as a result of the}} witch's spell, she also feels more able to speak her mind. According to Miyazaki, old women are only infrequently allowed to dominate the screen as in Howl's Moving Castle, which made it a risky concept. Elizabeth Parsons stated that the film disrupts the stereotype of [...] "aged unattractiveness," [...] when the artificially aged Sophie manages to rescue two attractive men (who <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> her) and to unintentionally end the war in her country. Sophie's actions are those usually associated with grandmothers, such as being kind and nurturing to those around her, and engaging in housework; however, these actions are depicted as being powerful and heroic. Sophie is one of several strong female protagonists in Miyazaki's films. According to Parsons, this gives the film a feminist aspect as well. Additionally, even though Sophie manages to make her presence in the castle legitimate by claiming to be a cleaning lady, the film goes on to show that the housework is equitably distributed, strengthening its feminist aspect.|$|E
500|$|One More Day was panned by {{fans and}} critics. IGN {{reviewer}} Jesse Schedeen described Amazing Spider-Man #545 as [...] "undoubtedly the worst comic Marvel published in 2007" [...] and a [...] "deus ex machina {{of the highest}} order." [...] He did admit that writer Straczynski [...] "had a great handle on the Peter/Mary Jane dynamic," [...] making their potentially final moments mean something, and that Quesada's artistic style made sense given the dark tone. However, he also dismissed the story as [...] "infuriating and downright disrespectful {{to anyone who has}} <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> Spider-Man comics over the years." [...] IGN published two [...] "Additional Take" [...] reviews for Amazing Spider-Man #545. Bryan Joel said that he'd been a [...] "vocal supporter" [...] of [...] "Brand New Day", but summarized the OMD story as [...] "flip, weightless, and painfully brief." [...] Richard George stated that [...] "One More Day" [...] "could prove to be the best example of editorial influence gone horribly, horribly wrong" [...] and [...] "in trying to preserve the appeal of Peter Parker, Joe Quesada has actually managed to fundamentally undermine the character." [...] Both Joel and George agreed with their colleague in complimenting Quesada's artwork. Tim Marchman of The Wall Street Journal stated that having Spider-Man make a deal with the devil-like Mephisto is [...] "the rough equivalent of having Z-movie director Uwe Boll film a studio-funded prequel to Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver." ...|$|E

Tom Frigoli of Alpha Omega News gave the album a grade of an A, praising the album for containing [...] "everything they’ve <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> and more with several radio-friendly songs." [...] Jonathan Faulkner of Alt Rock Live gave the album a seven out of ten stars, commenting that the album [...] "is defiantly {{a step in the}} right" [...] direction. Grace S. Aspinwall of CCM Magazine gave the album four out of five stars, praising the overall quality of the album and commending the band for [...] "staying true to themselves". Robert Ham of Christianity Today [...] gave the album three out of five stars, critiquing the album for [...] "sticking to the well-trodden road of modern worship". Tom Lennie of Cross Rhythms gave Come to the Well nine out of ten stars, praising the album's music and lyrics for being [...] "impacting" [...] and [...] "making for much more than just an enjoyable listen". Jonathan Andre of Indie Vision Music gave the album three out of five stars, calling it a [...] "thought-provoking album, about how society wants the temporary fix". Caldwell of Jesus Freak Hideout gave the album four out of five stars, describing it as [...] "skillfully walk the thin tightrope act of balancing a heart for ministry and discipleship with a broadly appealing (if sometimes too broadly appealing) pop rock soundtrack".|$|E

500|$|... "Million Dollar Maybe" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by television critics. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a 'B' grade, {{the highest of}} the night. VanDerWerff was polarized with the plot, opining that it was convoluted and stated, [...] "This was a completely stupid plot, but to the show's credit, it commented on this when Homer told Marge he won the lottery and she said she'd much rather have the money than the wedding reception performance he missed." [...] Similarly, VanDerWerff was split with the subplot of [...] "Million Dollar Maybe". In regards to the subplot, he wrote, [...] "The Lisa gets the old people a Wii stand-in plot {{was one of those}} ones where the Simpsons writers have obviously noticed something in pop culture but have yet to wholly grasp what it is or why it's important." [...] Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode an 8.1 out of 10, signifying a [...] "great" [...] rating. Canning felt that the episode was impressive, expressing that it was [...] "a fun and funny episode focused on Homer and his always dysfunctional relationship with his family [...] just what we've <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>love</b> and expect after 20 years." [...] Jason Hughes of [...] TV Squad gave the episode a more mixed review, praising the episode's humor, but calling it [...] "random". Hughes wrote, [...] "A lot about this episode bothered me, and I think The Simpsons has been having a pretty strong season for the most part." [...] He resumed, [...] "This one just didn't hold together as strongly as most of the prior ones." [...] He went on to criticize the character development of Ricardo, opining that it was a [...] "slap to the face to the winner." [...] He then commented: [...] "Peggy Black created Ricardo Bomba as a new ladies man type of figure, so the writers had him drive into a cliff wall and subsequent fiery explosion right away upon his first appearance. He didn't even get to finish what was, I guess, going to be his catchphrase." ...|$|E
