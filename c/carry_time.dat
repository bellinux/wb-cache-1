50|$|In quantum mechanics, the {{interaction}} picture (also {{known as the}} Dirac picture) is an intermediate representation between the Schrödinger picture and the Heisenberg picture. Whereas {{in the other two}} pictures either the state vector or the operators <b>carry</b> <b>time</b> dependence, in {{the interaction}} picture both carry part of the time dependence of observables. The interaction picture is useful in dealing with changes to the wave functions and observable due to interactions. Most field-theoretical calculations use the interaction representation because they construct the solution to the many-body Schrödinger equation as the solution to the free-particle problem plus some unknown interaction parts.|$|E
5000|$|The lob wedge can be {{used for}} any shot {{requiring}} a short carry distance (typically 10-50 yards), and/or a very high launch angle, which also results in high backspin and thus little rolling distance after impact. Such shots include tight approaches to the green, shots from close to a tree or other tall obstruction, shots to gain a more favorable lie on the fairway, and certain bunker shots. The high launch angle and thus long <b>carry</b> <b>time</b> can be an impediment in high winds, but skilled golfers can use the long [...] "hang time" [...] of a lob wedge shot {{to take advantage of a}} favorable wind. The wedge typically has low to moderate bounce (0-4°) for fairway and other firm lies, but because of its high loft even 2-3° of bounce will counterbalance the downward force of the wedge's striking face, making a club with this configuration useful in sand as well. Players will often use a lob wedge to play from a sand trap adjacent to the green, instead of [...] "opening" [...] a sand wedge (a more difficult shot to make accurately). It {{can be used}} with a full swing from the fairway or rough to carry about 40-60 yards, but it's more commonly used with a chip shot from very close to the green, to carry 10-40 yards and [...] "drop" [...] the ball into an exact spot on the green.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Avoiding access {{conflicts}} is a {{major challenge}} {{in the design of}} multi-threaded programs. In the context of real-time systems, the absence of conflicts can be guaranteed by ensuring that no two potentially conflicting accesses are ever scheduled concurrently. In this paper, we analyze programs that <b>carry</b> <b>time</b> annotations specifying the time for executing each statement. We propose a technique for verifying that a multi-threaded program with time annotations is free of access conflicts. In particular, we generate constraints that reflect the possible schedules for executing the program and the required properties. We then invoke an SMT solver in order to verify that no execution gives rise to concurrent conflicting accesses. Otherwise, we obtain a trace that exhibits the access conflict...|$|E

30|$|Synchronization is very {{important}} in time-shared access protocols, such as this one, to keep activity windows from overlapping because of clock drifts. To achieve synchronization, a mechanism such as the one described in [30, 31] can be used {{from the beginning of the}} initial setup process. As soon as a node identifies its parent node through the process described in Section 3.1, it can start exchanging synchronization messages with its parent and adopting its clock. This will eventually cause for all nodes to be synchronized to the sink's clock. After a successful reservation procedure, the node can start exchanging synchronization messages with its selected CH and again adopting its clock. This process can continue during the data exchange within the normal operation phase to avoid considerable drifts. Poll, Data and Null frames can <b>carry</b> <b>time</b> stamps to achieve this task.|$|E

40|$|As {{wireless}} {{sensor network}} becomes pervasive, new requirements have been continuously emerged.

Among these requirements, real-time communication {{is one of the}} big research challenges in wireless sensor networks because most of query messages <b>carry</b> <b>time</b> information. To meet this requirement, recently several real-time medium access control protocols have been proposed for wireless sensor networks in the literature because waiting time to share medium on each node is one of main source for end-to-end delay. In this paper, we first introduce the specific requirement of wireless sensor real-time MAC protocol. Then, a collection of recent wireless sensor real-time MAC protocols are surveyed, classified, and described emphasizing their advantages and disadvantages whenever possible. Finally we present a dis-cussion about the challenges of current wireless sensor real-time MAC protocols in the literature, and show the conclusion in the end...|$|E

30|$|Over {{the course}} of the data {{production}} pipeline described above, data are categorized into several predefined processing levels. Raw packet data received from the satellite and archived on SIRIUS are referred to as Level- 0. Level- 1 data are converted to regular files on the reformatting system at ISAS. Level- 1 data <b>carry</b> <b>time</b> labels converted to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), while observed data values are stored in instrument-dependent units. Further processes at the ERG-SC, including data calibration, generate Level- 2 data. Unlike Level- 1 data, Level- 2 data have been assigned standard physical units as well as some geophysical coordinates. Data up to Level- 2 are generated solely from Level- 1 data of a single instrument. Level- 3 data are the merged products of multiple Level- 2 data points from different instruments. A typical example is pitch angle distributions of particle fluxes, which merges particle flux data from a particle instrument and magnetic field data from the magnetic field experiment (MGF) (Matsuoka et al. 2018). Another example is electron density data that are deduced using frequency traces of upper hybrid resonance observed by the PWE instrument (Kasahara et al. 2018 b; Kumamoto et al. 2018) and MGF data. Level- 3 particle data also go through inter-instrument calibrations to produce particle flux and phase space density data of electrons over a combined energy range of ~[*] 20  eV to more than 10  MeV. These data are referred to as Level- 4 data.|$|E
40|$|The packet {{delivery}} ratio and throughput in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) {{depend on the}} network connectivity and degrade as the connectivity decreases. A delay-tolerant approach increases the packet {{delivery ratio}} in partially connected networks. In the previous studies, the packet lifetime and the vehicle's packet <b>carry</b> <b>time</b> are determined to maximize the packet delivery ratio in partially connected VANETs. However, IPv 6 uses the hop count in the Hop Limit field instead of using seconds in the TTL field, as in IPv 4. Similarly, although IPv 4 packets are designed to carry the packet lifetime in seconds in the TTL field, this field {{is used for the}} hop count in practice. In this case, there is no mechanism to determine how long vehicles will carry packets in VANETs when delivering packets in a delay-tolerant fashion. In this study, we propose approaches for the delivery of IPv 6 packets in a delay-tolerant fashion in partially connected networks. We also propose another method that enhances these proposed approaches and optimizes the packet delivery ratio. The proposed approaches are simulated to observe performance results. Our analysis shows that the proposed approaches can be easily adopted for IPv 6 /IPv 4 packets to be delivered in a delay-tolerant fashion. Additionally, we observe that our approaches increase the packet delivery ratio in partially connected Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks and can also be used in networks where the nodes are mobile or connections get broken frequently...|$|E
