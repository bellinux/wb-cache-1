This study examined the capacity of an indigenous isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to remediate the diesel <b>contaminated</b> <b>soil.</b> Five different sets of cement bioreactors containing 2. 5 kg soil; Bioreactor A (control, uncontaminated soil), B (sterilized <b>soil),</b> C (<b>contaminated</b> <b>soil</b> without any addition), D (<b>contaminated</b> <b>soil</b> {{with the addition of}} nutrients), E (<b>contaminated</b> <b>soil</b> with the addition of nutrients and bacterial inoculum) were prepared. Different soil enzyme activities like dehydrogenase, catalases, lipase and FDA hydrolase along with physicochemical parameters were investigated during the bioremediation process. The results obtained revealed that bioaugmentation of P. aeruginosa in diesel <b>contaminated</b> <b>soil</b> proved to be a better approach. 66 % diesel degradation was observed during the incubation period of 30 days.

25|$|Fungi {{have been}} found to have a {{protective}} role for plants rooted in soils with high metal concentrations, such as acidic and <b>contaminated</b> <b>soils.</b> Pine trees inoculated with Pisolithus tinctorius planted in several contaminated sites displayed high tolerance to the prevailing contaminant, survivorship and growth. One study discovered the existence of Suillus luteus strains with varying tolerance of zinc.

This was probably due to binding of the metal to the extramatricial mycelium of the fungus, without affecting the exchange of beneficial substances.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} {{took place}} in the form of new buildings being built inside the dome structure. The dome structure was not changed as part of the construction with the exception of blue lights being added to the support poles and plasma displays being added to some of the large sculptures around the dome. Construction started with the arena roof, which was built on the ground and then raised, as cranes could not be used in the dome structure. The construction then moved on to the arena building itself and the entertainment avenue around the arena building. A wide pathway between North Greenwich station and The O2 was also built, as well as the Peninsula Square piazza in front of the dome for special events. A glass roof was built over part of the pathway so that people can walk from the station to The O2 without getting wet in rain. A covered path was also built between the QE2 Pier and The O2's main entrance. Buro Happold provided structural engineering for the project. The main civil engineering and construction contract for the development was awarded to Sir Robert McAlpine. Watson Steel Structures provided engineering for the 4500 tonne arena roof. M-E Engineers were the building services engineers for the project. T. Clarke were the electrical contractors. OR Consulting engineers set up a few interactive exhibitions within The O2. Keller Ground engineering prepared the ground for construction. Special ground preparation was necessary due to the <b>contaminated</b> <b>soils</b> from the industrial works which existed at the site before the dome. Catalytic converters were also installed within the dome to prevent toxic gases due to the dome structure being left in place. The plant cylinders, containing services equipment, and some piles used for the original dome, were reused. Financial consulting was provided by WT Partnership and EC Harris. The Waterfront partnership provided legal support for the development and continues to do so for The O2. Kerzner International helped with the development of the entertainment venues.|$|E
