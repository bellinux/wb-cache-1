500|$|The {{creation}} of roguelike games came from hobbyist programmers and computer hackers, attempting to create {{games for the}} nascent <b>computer</b> <b>field</b> in the early 1980s, particularly influenced by the 1975 text adventure game Colossal Cave Adventure (often simply titled Adventure), and from the high fantasy setting of the tabletop game Dungeons & Dragons. Some elements of the roguelike genre were present in dungeon crawlers written for the PLATO system. This includes pedit5 (1975) {{believed to be the}} first dungeon crawl game, and featured random monster encounters, though only used a single fixed dungeon level. pedit5 inspired similar PLATO-based dungeon crawlers dnd (1975), orthanc (1978), Moria (1978), and [...] avatar (1979). It is unclear if these PLATO games inspired the roguelike genre as there is no evidence that the early roguelike creators had access to these games. The core roguelike games were developed independently of each other, many of the developers not learning about their respective projects until several years after the genre took off.|$|E

Reiser attended the university off and on until he received a BS in computer science in 1992 at the age of 28.
