25|$|Computable {{functions}} {{are the basic}} objects of study in computability theory. Computable {{functions are}} the formalized analogue of the intuitive notion of algorithm, {{in the sense that}} a function is computable if there exists an algorithm that <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> of the function, i.e. given an input of the function domain it can return the corresponding output. Computable functions are used to discuss computability without referring to any concrete model of computation such as Turing machines or register machines. Any definition, however, must make reference to some specific model of computation but all valid definitions yield the same class of functions.|$|E
500|$|Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) has tasked Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{with finding}} a {{part-time}} replacement for Jim Halpert (John Krasinski). Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{is concerned about}} this, as Jim's replacement will be her new [...] "deskmate". Clark Green (Clark Duke) feels he {{is ready for the}} position, citing his key role in various sales, but Dwight wants someone who he can be sure will not team up with Pam against him. To that end, he brings in a bizarre gallery of his relatives and close friends, including his cousin Mose (Michael Schur), best friend Rolf (James Urbaniak), part-time private investigator Trevor (Chris Gethard), former Corporate executive Troy Undercook (Noel Petok), and his karate teacher Sensei Ira (Lance Krall). To Dwight's horror, though, none of his candidates are competent enough to even make it through the full job interview, much less be paper salesmen. Clark ends his interview after answering Dwight's complicated questions perfectly, pointing out that he {{has no choice but to}} hire him if he wants someone who <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Denitrification {{requires}} anoxic {{conditions to}} encourage the appropriate biological communities to form. It is facilitated by a wide diversity of bacteria. Sand filters, lagooning and reed beds can all be used to reduce nitrogen, but the activated sludge process (if designed well) <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> the most easily. Since denitrification is the reduction of nitrate to dinitrogen (molecular nitrogen) gas, an electron donor is needed. This can be, depending on the waste water, organic matter (from feces), sulfide, or an added donor like methanol. [...] The sludge in the anoxic tanks (denitrification tanks) must be mixed well (mixture of recirculated mixed liquor, return activated sludge , and raw influent) e.g. by using submersible mixers {{in order to achieve}} the desired denitrification.|$|E

This requirement comes from the Title 46 Part 310 of the Code of Federal Regulations which requires all cadets who are pursuing licensing as a deck or engineering officer in the United States Merchant Marine to participate in a cadet program. The goals of participation in the Corps of Cadets is to positively develop traits such as punctuality, ability to follow orders, initiative, and attention to detail, teamwork, time management, patience, responsibility, leadership, and professionalism. These traits require that new cadets develop self-discipline enabling every graduate to excel in their future occupation, at sea or ashore. Some tasks required of cadets are more desirable than others, but every cadet must prove they <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> required of them before they can become leaders.|$|R
2500|$|The {{principal}} witch in {{the series}} is Granny Weatherwax, who at first glance {{seems to be a}} taciturn, bitter old crone, from the small mountain country of Lancre. She largely despises people but takes on the role of their healer and protector because no one else <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> as well as she can. Her closest friend is Nanny Ogg, a jolly, personable witch with the [...] "common touch" [...] who enjoys a smoke and a pint of beer, often leading to her singing bawdy folk songs including the notorious [...] "Hedgehog Song". The two take on apprentice witches, initially Magrat Garlick, then Agnes Nitt, and then Tiffany Aching, who in turn go on to become accomplished witches in their own right, and, in Magrat's case, Queen of Lancre.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the film}} Razieh, a strong-willed {{little girl in}} Tehran, wants to buy a lucky {{goldfish}} for the upcoming Iranian New Year celebration, but struggles to get and {{hold on to the}} 500-toman banknote needed to purchase the fish. Panahi worked closely with Mohammadkhani, gaining her trust and acting out each scene for her to mimic while still adding her own personality to the performance. Panahi was most concerned about Mohammadkhani being able to cry on cue, so he would have her stare at him off camera while he started to cry, causing her to cry. Filming began in early April 1994 in Kashan, Iran and continued until early June. Panahi has stated that during the making of his feature debut he [...] "wanted to prove to myself that I <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>job,</b> that I can finish a feature film successfully and get good acting out of my players." [...] He also stated that [...] "In a world where films are made with millions of dollars, we made a film about a little girl who wants to buy a fish for less than a dollar – this is what we’re trying to show." [...] In Iran, films depicting children are the most likely to avoid censorship or political controversy, and The White Balloon was screened exclusively in theatres that specialized in children's films. Because of this the film had low attendance on its initial run in Iranian theatres, with only 130,000 tickets sold.|$|E

We compare two different types of decision-making regimes: autocratic decision-making and group voting. Using a laboratory experiment to simulate a data-entry organization, we find that, while autocratic decision-making and group voting regimes both curtail cyberloafing (by over 50 %), it is only in group voting that there is a substantive improvement (of 38 %) in a cyberloafer’s subsequent work performance. Unlike autocratic decision-making, group voting leads to workgroups outperforming the control condition where cyberloafing could not be stopped. Additionally, only in the group voting regime did production levels of cyberloafers and non-loafers converge over time...|$|R
