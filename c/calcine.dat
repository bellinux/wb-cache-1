40|$|Mine wastes <b>calcines</b> {{were formed}} through {{retorting}} of cinnabar ores at high temperature, which are considered as significant sources of mercury (Hg) contamination {{to the local}} environment. To better understand the role of mine waste in Hg geochemical cycle in Hg mining areas, Hg speciation and mobility were evaluated in mine waste <b>calcines</b> and waste rocks from 9 Hg mines in China.

The <b>calcines</b> had significant higher Hg 2 + and Hg 0 concentrations than the waste rocks, which indicated the retorting process can produce large amounts of secondary by-product Hg compounds.

This may be observed in those who by some mischance have lost their sight when they were very young; in whom the ideas of colours having been but slightly taken notice of, and ceasing to be repeated, do quite wear out; so that some years after, there is no more notion nor memory of colours left in their minds, than in those of people born blind. The memory of some men, it is true, is very tenacious, even to a miracle. But yet {{there seems to be a}} constant decay of all our ideas, even of those which are struck deepest, and in minds the most retentive; so that if they be not sometimes renewed, by repeated exercise of the senses, or reflection on those kinds of objects which at first occasioned them, the print wears out, and at last there remains nothing to be seen. Thus the ideas, as well as children, of our youth, often die before us: and our minds represent to us those tombs to which we are approaching; where, though the brass and marble remain, yet the inscriptions are effaced by time, and the imagery moulders away. The pictures drawn in our minds are laid in fading colours; and if not sometimes refreshed, vanish and disappear. How much the constitution of our bodies are concerned in this; and whether the temper of the brain makes this difference, that in some it retains the characters drawn on it like marble, in others like freestone, and in others little better than sand, I shall here inquire; though it may seem probable that the constitution of the body does sometimes influence the memory, since we oftentimes find a disease quite strip the mind of all its ideas, and the flames of a fever in a few days <b>calcine</b> all those images to dust and confusion, which seemed to be as lasting as if graved in marble.|$|E
50|$|Hadrucalcin is a peptide toxin {{from the}} {{scorpion}} <b>calcine</b> family. The mature Hadrucalcin peptide {{is composed of}} 35 amino acids, whereas {{other members of the}} scorpion <b>calcine</b> family are composed of 33 amino acids. Based on the high degree of sequence similarity with Maurocalcin, it is predicted that Hadrucalcin folds along an inhibitor cystine knot motif, with disulfide bonds between positions 5 and 19, 12 and 23 and 18 and 34 of the mature peptide. Hadrucalcin has a molecular weight of 4190.5 Da. The most notable difference between Hadrucalcin {{and other members of the}} scorpion <b>calcine</b> family is that hadrucalcin lacks two positive charged Lysine residues (at positions 8 and 22 in other scorpion <b>calcine</b> toxins), that were previously thought to be important for affinity with RyR1. Instead, Hadrucalcin has two Lysine residues at positions 3 and 7 of the mature peptide, near the otherwise neutral N-terminal, resulting in a relatively low degree of amphiphilicity.|$|E

Ammonium molybdophosphate (AMP) immobilized on a polyacrylonitrile support (AMP-PAN) has been studied as an ion exchange agent for cesium removal from acidic waste solutions. Capacities, distribution coefficients, elutability, and kinetics of cesium-extraction have been evaluated. Exchange breakthrough curves using small columns have been determined from 1 M HNO{sub 3 } and simulated waste solutions. The theoretical capacity of AMP is 213 g Cs/kg AMP. The average experimental capacity in batch contacts with various acidic solutions was 150 g Cs/kg AMP. The measured cesium distribution coefficients from actual waste solutions were 3287 mL/g for dissolved zirconia <b>calcines,</b> and 2679 mL/g for sodium-bearing waste. The cesium in the dissolved alumina <b>calcines</b> was analyzed for; however, the concentration was below analytical detectable limits resulting in inconclusive results.

The Pb–(Ag) –Zn ore deposits are of the high sulphidation vein and stockwork type. There are two main mining sites: San Cristóbal–Perules (adjacent to the town of Mazarrón) and Pedreras Viejas. The area is located in the southern realm of a Miocene marine basin surrounded by mountains in its western, eastern and southern flanks. A main seasonal river (Rambla de las Moreras) crosses the basin from North to South and is strongly affected by contaminated sediments from the San Cristóbal– Perules mining site. The mine tailings are extremely rich in Pb (mean= 12, 400 μg g− 1) and Zn (mean= 6100 μg g− 1), whereas As concentrations are also very high (mean= 650 μg g− 1). Our geochemical survey also covered anthropic soils, stream sediments and the so-called almagres deposits (red alum <b>calcines).</b> All these environmental matrices have also very high concentrations of Pb, Zn, As, and Cd compared to our local or world baseline concentrations. The <b>calcines</b> are rich in As (mean= 450 μg g− 1), and the main environmental concern relates to the wrong use of these materials as agricultural soils at discrete sites in the district.

The result of this process is a solid and a liquid; the liquid contains the zinc and is often called leach product; the solid is called leach residue and contains precious metals (usually lead and silver) which are sold as a by-product. There is also iron in the leach product from the strong acid leach, which is removed in an intermediate step, in the form of goethite, jarosite, and haematite.
