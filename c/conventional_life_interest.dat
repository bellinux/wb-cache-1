The predictivity of a combination of central <b>life</b> <b>interest</b> scores and subjects 2 ̆ 7 demographic variables to performance and tenure were also explored. The central <b>life</b> <b>interest</b> scores were not found to be a good predictor of performance or tenure. In general, the subjects in this sample were not job-oriented in their central <b>life</b> <b>interest</b> scores. However, they tended to be job-oriented in the aspects of membership of formal organization and technological environment but non-job-oriented in informal personal relations and general everyday experience. Marital status did affect subjects 2 ̆ 7 central <b>life</b> <b>interest</b> scores. Married managers without children seemed to be more job-oriented than managers in any other marital status. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{number of}} {{scholars}} following the tempo approach in fertility continues to grow, whereas tempo-adjustment in mortality generally still is rejected. This rejection is irrational in principle, {{as the basic}} idea behind the tempo approach is independent {{of the kind of}} demographic event. Providing the first empirical application to a substantial problem, this paper shows that mortality tempo-adjustment can paint a different picture of current mortality conditions compared to <b>conventional</b> <b>life</b> expectancy. An application of the Bongaarts and Feeney method to the analysis of mortality differences between western and eastern Germany shows that the eastern German disadvantages still are considerably higher and that the mortality gap between the two entities began to narrow some years later than trends in <b>conventional</b> <b>life</b> expectancy suggest. Thus, the picture drawn by tempo-adjusted life expectancy fits the expected trends of changing mortality and also the self-reported health conditions of eastern and western Germans better than that painted by <b>conventional</b> <b>life</b> expectancy.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{designed}} {{to determine the extent to}} which selected Indiana superintendents of schools tie work as central <b>life</b> <b>interest</b> and to compare leadership behaviors of superintendents identified as having high interest in work and superintendents with low work interest, as perceived by subordinate administrators. Ninety-five of the 116 superintendents invited to participate in the study completed the Central <b>Life</b> <b>Interest</b> Inventory developed by Dubin. Analyses of responses resulted in identification of the intensity to which superintendents viewed work as a central <b>life</b> <b>interest.</b> Subordinate administrators identified by the twenty-five superintendents identified as having high commitment to work and subordinate administrators identified by the twenty-five superintendents identified as having low interest in work were invited to evaluate respective superintendents by means of the Leader Behavior Description Questionnaire- - Form XII. Twelve null hypotheses were developed to facilitate determination of statistically significant differences between subordinate administrator evaluative response of superintendents having high interest in work and superintendents having low interest in work. Statistical treatment of the twelve hypotheses was accomplished by means of the chi-square test of significance. The. 05 level of confidence was established as the critical probability level for the non-acceptance of hypotheses. Findings relative to the first study purpose, which was to measure the extent to which selected Indiana superintendents view work as central <b>life</b> <b>interest,</b> were: 1. Thirty-two, or 33. 6 percent, of the ninety-five participating superintendents had a high interest in work as a central <b>life</b> <b>interest.</b> 2. Eighteen earlier studies had measured the extent to which persons in various occupations viewed work as a central <b>life</b> <b>interest.</b> When superintendents were compared and contrasted, nine occupational groups reflected higher interest in work as a central <b>life</b> <b>interest</b> and nine groups reflected lower interest in work as a central <b>life</b> <b>interest.</b> Superintendents had a higher interest in work as a central <b>life</b> <b>interest</b> than lumber workers, truck drivers, American factory workers, secondary teachers, elementary teachers, principals, industrial arts teachers, clerical workers, and British factory workers. Superintendents had a lower interest in work as a central <b>life</b> <b>interest</b> than management personnel in Japanese industry, cooperative extension agents, nurses, Amana Colony workers, management personnel in American industry, middle managers in Oregon, middle managers in seven states, industrial supervisors, and German industrial workers. Findings relative to the second study purpose, a comparison of the leadership behaviors of the high and low superintendent groups as measured by perceptions of subordinate administrators using the Leader Behavior Description Questionnaire [...] Form XII instrument, were no statistically significant differences were found to exist for the three specific leadership behaviors factors of Representation, Demand Reconciliation, and Initiation of Structures. Statistically significant differences were found to exist for each of the nine specific leadership factors of Tolerance of Uncertainty, Persuasiveness, Tolerance of Freedom, Role Assumption, Consideration, Production Emphasis, Predictive Accuracy, Integration, and Superior Orientation. The major conclusion relative to the first study purpose was that even though relatively small percentages of superintendents might score as having high commitment to work as a central <b>life</b> <b>interest,</b> superintendents as a group do have high professional standards and are committed to performing job responsibilities effectively and efficiently. The major conclusion relative to the second study purpose as that superintendents with a high commitment to work as a central lire interest, are perceived by subordinates as being more effective leaders.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was fourfold. The first purpose was to {{determine}} the degree to which Indiana high school athletic directors consider work to be a central <b>life</b> <b>interest.</b> The second {{purpose of the}} study was to determine if there is a significant difference between the proportions of athletic directors of small and large high schools determined to be work oriented as measured by the Central <b>Life</b> <b>Interest</b> Inventory. The third {{purpose of the study}} was to determine if there is a significant difference in the leadership effectiveness of athletic directors who are highly interested in their work as compared to athletic directors who are least interested in their work as a central <b>life</b> <b>interest.</b> The fourth {{purpose of the study was}} to determine if there is a significant difference between the leadership effectiveness of athletic directors who are intensely interested in being athletic director in either small or large high schools. The Central <b>Life</b> <b>Interest</b> Inventory and the Leader Behavior Description Questionnaire – Form XII were utilized to gather data. Three null hypotheses were tested using the Multivariate Analysis of Variance. The. 05 level of significance was established as the critical probability level for the non-acceptance of hypotheses. Conclusions 1. Thirty-one, or 24 %, of the one-hundred and thirty-one athletic directors participating in the study consider their work as a central <b>life</b> <b>interest.</b> 2. A statistical analysis showed that there is no statistically significant difference in the central <b>life</b> <b>interest</b> between the proportions of work oriented athletic directors from the small and large high schools. 3. A statistical analysis showed that there is no statistically significant difference between the average ratings of Group I (highly interested in work) and Group II (least interested in work) when rated by subordinate head coaches relative to the twelve factors of leadership. 4. A statistical analysis showed that there is a statistically significant difference between the average ratings of small and large high school athletic directors by subordinate head coaches relative to the twelve factors of leadership. However, the difference was not interpretable using the Univariate Analysis of Variance statistics. Department of Secondary, Higher, and Foundations of EducationThesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R

To ensure that, in today's global scenario, employees stay in the organization and perform at peak levels, managers need to adopt a game changing strategy. Butler. T and Waldroop. J, in their article published in the Harvard Business Review, September/October, 1999 have introduced the concept of Job Sculpting i. e. matching jobs to deeply embedded <b>life</b> <b>interests.</b> Deeply embedded <b>life</b> <b>interests</b> are positively correlated to individual life motivators. Motivation induces employees to take certain actions or behave in a certain way. Motivation drives a person towards a desired goal. Individual motivators can be classified into status, power, monetary rewards, autonomy, and search for meaning, security, affiliation, achievement, and creativity. The researchers have developed a model based on the interviews of 300 employees across various job designations within 25 organizations in India in 2011, to identify the presence or otherwise of these motivators in individuals and to measure the relative importance assigned to each motivator on a subjective basis by each individual. Subsequently, the researchers have studied job satisfaction {{as a product of}} congruence between motivators, <b>life</b> <b>interests,</b> job expectations and actual job description. This model can be used by Managers in developing a game changing strategy to map the innate <b>life</b> <b>interests</b> to the job profile of each employee in the organization resulting in a sculpted job description that will greatly enhance employee productivity, reduce attrition, and help in attainment of overall organizational objectives...|$|R
