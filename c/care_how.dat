25|$|MG Walt formalized {{the program}} in February 1967, {{appointing}} LtCol William R. Corson as the III MAF deputy director for Combined Action. Corson believed CAP should have a separate chain of command, as it was his opinion that the average battalion commander in Vietnam often didn’t know or <b>care</b> <b>how</b> to succeed in combined action, since they were trained and oriented toward offensive large-unit warfare. Corson saw CAP as being mobile and offensive in nature, a concept which later took shape in the mobile CAP units. However, Corson eventually became disenchanted with {{the conduct of the}} war.|$|E

She believes that Kōichi, Shige and Keizō don't <b>care</b> <b>how</b> hard it was for their father when he lost their mother. Kyōko believes that strangers and even Noriko would've been more respectful towards her. Noriko responds that while she understands Kyoko's disappointment with her siblings, she also explains that everyone has their own life to lead and that the drift {{between parents and children}} is inevitable.

According to Wainwright, Waronker [...] "didn't <b>care</b> <b>how</b> long it took, {{as long as we}} were doing good work."

[...] As McKinley was carried out on a stretcher to an electric-powered ambulance, there was a moan from the crowd {{at the sight of the}} President's ashen face. [...] Foster rode with him on the way to the fair's hospital. [...] On the way there, McKinley felt in his clothing and came out with a metal object. [...] "I believe that is a bullet."

500|$|When a final {{agreement}} was reached with the Republican legislative leadership, Dayton called a special session of the legislature on July 19. The legislature met on July 20 and passed the budget bills, which were signed the same day by the governor. Most state employees returned to work on July 21, facing a backlog of unfinished work and new problems in many agencies. After the budget was passed, Dayton said he approached Republicans again after meeting with ordinary citizens—who said they wanted government services to resume and did not <b>care</b> <b>how</b> the shutdown was ended—and because he feared a worse budget deal and unease in the DFL legislative minorities. Zellers said when the deal was finalized that in his view it was [...] "a deal {{that we can all}} be disappointed in, but a deal that is done, a budget that was balanced". His sentiments that a 'balanced' budget needed to be passed, and that both sides had something to be unhappy about, were echoed by Koch.|$|E
500|$|Observers {{regularly}} noted {{incidents of}} marital discord between Anne and James. The so-called Gowrie conspiracy of 1600, {{in which the}} young Earl of Gowrie, John Ruthven, and his brother Alexander Ruthven were killed by James' attendants for a supposed assault on the King, triggered the dismissal of their sisters Beatrix and Barbara Ruthven as ladies-in-waiting to Anne, with whom they were [...] "in chiefest credit." [...] The Queen, who was five months pregnant, refused {{to get out of}} bed unless they were reinstated and stayed there for two days, also refusing to eat. When James tried to command her, she warned him to take <b>care</b> <b>how</b> he treated her because she was not the Earl of Gowrie. James placated her for the moment by paying a famous acrobat to entertain her, but she never gave up, and her stubborn support for the Ruthvens over the next three years was taken seriously enough by the government to be regarded as a security issue. In 1602, after discovering that Anne had smuggled Beatrix Ruthven into Holyrood, James carried out a cross-examination of the entire household; in 1603, he finally decided to grant Beatrix Ruthven a pension of £200.|$|E

500|$|Constantine began co-hosting What Not to Wear with Trinny Woodall in 2001, which {{required}} using her fashion advice and expertise {{in order to}} reform participants' appearances and fashion style. Constantine and Woodall hosted What Not to Wear until 2005 and became renowned for their tactile behaviour with the participants, direct advice, and frequently referring to breasts as tits which {{has become something of}} a trademark. Never one to hold back, a notorious moment arose when Constantine spontaneously pulled a female candidate's underwear down during filming as her knicker line was visible. Critics of What Not to Wear argued that the duo were too patronising to their subjects, a claim which they strongly disagree with. Constantine insists that their subjects [...] "see we have a genuine love of women. We love women and they can see that. Women just know." [...] She also stated [...] "Ultimately, what we're doing is giving people confidence. We're probably the only people who have an opinion, who <b>care</b> <b>how</b> ordinary people dress. No one at Vogue magazine gives a shit. They work with the designers, it's more creative and artistic – they are creating something beautiful. But they don't care about how their readers end up looking – whereas we do!" [...] The show made Constantine and Woodall household names and they are now known together as Trinny and Susannah. One reporter has simply referred to Constantine as [...] "the one with 'big tits'." [...] Constantine and Woodall have even considered taking insurance out on their partnership should something unforeseen happen, although Constantine was against the move.|$|E
500|$|Barber's first attempt, modeled for {{the half}} dollar, disregarded Leech's instructions. Instead of a design based on French coinage, it {{depicted}} a standing figure of Columbia, bearing a pileus atop a liberty pole; an eagle spreading its wings stands behind her. The reverse utilized the heraldic eagle from the Great Seal of the United States, enclosed inside a thick oak wreath, with the required legends surrounding the rim. Leech rejected the design, and Barber submitted a revised obverse in mid-September {{with a head}} of Liberty similar to that on the adopted coin. Leech got feedback from friends and from Secretary Foster; on September 28, he wrote Barber that Liberty's lips were [...] "rather voluptuous" [...] and directed him to prepare a reverse without the wreath. Barber did so, and pattern coins based on the revised design were struck. Barber complained, in a letter on October 2 to Superintendent Bosbyshell, but intended for Leech, that the constant demands for changes were wasting his time. Leech replied, stating {{that he did not}} <b>care</b> <b>how</b> much effort was expended in order to improve the design, especially since, once issued, they would have to be used for 25 years. Barber's reply was transmitted to Leech on October 6 with a cover letter from Acting Superintendent Mark Cobb (Bosbyshell was traveling) stating that Barber [...] "disclaims any intention to be captious and certainly did not intend to question your prerogative as one of the officers designed by law to pass upon new designs for coinage". The letter from Barber was a lengthy technical explanation for various design elements, and requested further advice from Leech if he had preferences; the overall tone was argumentative. Leech chose not to write again; he addressed one concern, about whether the olive branches in the design were rendered accurately, by visiting the National Botanical Garden, obtaining one, and sending it to Barber.|$|E

500|$|Many {{ideas were}} {{suggested}} for {{the sequel to}} Friday the 13th, including making the title part of a serialized film series, where each succeeding film would be its own story and not related to any previous film under the Friday the 13th moniker. It was Phil Scuderi, one of the producers for the original film, which suggested bringing Jason back for the sequel. The director Steve Miner felt it was the obvious direction to take the series, as he felt the audience {{wanted to know more}} about the child who attacked Alice in the lake. Miner decided to pretend as if Alice did not see the [...] "real Jason" [...] in her dream, and Jason had survived his drowning as a boy and had grown up. After killing Jason in The Final Chapter, it was the director Joseph Zito's intention to leave the door open for the studio to make more films with Tommy Jarvis as the main antagonist. Screenwriter Barney Cohen felt Jarvis would become a substitute for Jason, but the idea was never fully developed in A New Beginning. Director and co-screenwriter Danny Steinmann disliked the idea of Jason not being the killer, but decided to use Tommy's fear of Jason as the primary story. This idea was immediately abandoned in Jason Lives, when A New Beginning did not spark the [...] "creative success" [...] the studio was looking for. Executive producer Frank Mancuso, Jr. wanted to bring Jason back, and he did not <b>care</b> <b>how</b> it was achieved. In yet another alteration of the series' continuity, Tom McLoughlin chose to ignore the idea that Jason had survived his drowning, instead presenting him as always having been some sort of supernatural force. Since A New Beginning, no sequel has attempted to replace Jason as the main antagonist. Miller, who has not seen any of the sequels, took issue with all of them because they made Jason the villain. Miller believes the best part of his screenplay was that it was about a mother avenging the senseless death of her son. Miller stated, [...] "Jason was dead from the very beginning; he was a victim, not a villain." ...|$|E
