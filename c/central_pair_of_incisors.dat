5000|$|The bat has a short, broad, muzzle, with a prominent, spear-like, nose-leaf. The [...] "bidentate" [...] part of {{the name}} refers {{to the fact that}} there are {{normally}} only a single <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>incisors</b> in the lower jaw, whereas all other yellow-eared bats have two pairs. However, this is not true of all individuals, some of which do have two <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> lower <b>incisors</b> like their relatives.|$|R
50|$|Ruberodon is an extinct genus of traversodontid cynodont {{known only}} from the type species Ruberodon roychowdhurii from the Late Triassic of India. Ruberodon was named in 2015 {{on the basis of}} several {{isolated}} lower jaws found in the Tiki Formation. The lower jaw of Ruberodon has three <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>incisors,</b> one <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> canines, and 9 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> postcanine teeth. The first <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>incisors</b> is enlarged and protrudes forward from the tip of the jaw and there is a gap called a diastema between the canines and postcanines. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that among traversodontids, R. roychowdhurii is most closely related to Exaeretodon statisticae, which is also from India.|$|R
5|$|The toothcomb of {{treeshrews}} is {{like the}} lemuriform toothcomb in that it uses interdental spaces to form the comb tines, but only two <b>of</b> its three <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> lower <b>incisors</b> {{are included in the}} toothcomb and the canines are also excluded. The lateral two incisors in the toothcomb are generally larger. In the extinct arctocyonids, all six lower <b>incisors</b> were part <b>of</b> the toothcomb. In African antelopes, the toothcomb is strikingly similar to that of lemuriforms in that it consists <b>of</b> two <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>incisors</b> and a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> canines.|$|R
5000|$|Many prehistoric hippo fossils {{are known}} {{primarily}} through fossils {{of the lower}} jaw. Archaeopotamus, like Hexaprotodon, has three <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>incisors.</b> Unlike other Hexaprotodon, Archaeopotamus has a highly elongate mandibular symphysis. The informal name [...] "narrow muzzled hippos" [...] has been suggested for this genus.|$|R
5000|$|Hexaprotodon is a genus of Hippopotamidae that is {{sometimes}} {{applied to the}} pygmy hippopotamus. Pygmy hippos may be classified as either Choeropsis liberiensis or Hexaprotodon liberiensis. The name Hexaprotodon means [...] "six front teeth" [...] {{as some of the}} fossil forms have three <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>incisors.</b>|$|R
5|$|Among lemurs, the toothcomb is {{variable}} in structure. Among indriids (Indriidae), the toothcomb is less procumbent {{and consists of}} four teeth instead of six. The indriid toothcomb is more robust and wider, with shorter incisors, wider spaces between the teeth (interdental spaces), and a broader apical ridge. It is unclear whether this four-toothed toothcomb consists <b>of</b> two <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>incisors</b> or one <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>incisors</b> and one <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> canines. In fork-marked lemurs (Phaner) the toothcomb is more compressed, with significantly reduced interdental spaces. All six teeth are longer, straighter, and form a more continuous apical ridge. In the recently extinct monkey lemurs (Archaeolemuridae) and sloth lemurs (Palaeopropithecidae), the toothcomb was lost and the incisors and canines resumed a typical configuration {{in the front of}} the mouth. The aye-aye also lost its toothcomb, replacing it with continually growing (hypselodont) front teeth, similar to the <b>incisors</b> <b>of</b> rodents.|$|R
50|$|With {{a length}} of 1.6 metres (5 ft 4 in), Kvabebihyrax was much larger than modern hyraxes, {{comparable}} in size to larger species of the Paleogene genus Titanohyrax. Its robust body and eyes placed high on the skull gave it a hippopotamus-like appearance. It also had large <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>incisors</b> in both jaws.|$|R
25|$|The Iriomote cat has six <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>incisors,</b> two <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> canine teeth, four <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> premolars, and two <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> molars for a {{total of}} 28 teeth. Compared to other cats, {{including}} small wild cats, the Iriomote cat is lacking one <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> premolars on the top jaw behind the canines. In addition to this, unlike most other subtropical mammals, Iriomote cats' teeth give details about their year-to-year history. It is expected that these details will help determine the age and behavior of the cats.|$|R
25|$|The greater short-nosed {{fruit bat}} {{is similar to}} the lesser short-nosed fruit bat but has {{generally}} longer forearms, longer ears and a much longer skull. P. lucasi has only one <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> lower <b>incisors,</b> a lack <b>of</b> white edges to the ears and a usually greyer color. C. horsfieldi is larger, with heavily cusped molars. M. ecaudatus usually has a more upturned nose, lacks a bright collar and tail, and has only one <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> lower <b>incisors.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Whereas rodents have gnawing incisors {{that grow}} {{throughout}} life, {{the teeth of}} shrews wear down throughout life, a problem made more extreme because they lose their milk teeth before birth, so have only one set of teeth throughout their lifetimes.

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that the central apparatus plays a significant role in regulating flagellar motility, yet little is known about how the <b>central</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> microtubules or their associated projections assemble. Several Chlamydomonas mutants are defective in central apparatus assembly. For example, mutant pf 15 cells have paralyzed flagella that completely lack the <b>central</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> microtubules. We have cloned the wild-type PF 15 gene and confirmed its identity by rescuing the motility and ultrastructural defects in two pf 15 alleles, the original pf 15 a mutant and a mutant generated by insertional mutagenesis. Database searches using the 798 -amino-acid polypeptide predicted from the complete coding sequence indicate that the PF 15 gene encodes the Chlamydomonas homologue of the katanin p 80 subunit. Katanin was originally identified as a heterodimeric protein with a microtubule-severing activity.

50|$|Dodecacopter is a dodecarotor {{designed}} by FYAT, {{with a total}} of twelve rotors. Dodecacopter is similar to another multirotor developed by FYAT, the FYAT Intelligent Eagle. Common feature shared by both multirotor is that the fuselage is l shaped, {{with a total of}} six arms attached, three on each side.

40|$|There is now {{considerable}} {{evidence that}} the basis for ciliary and flagellar movement is an active sliding between peripheral doublet microtubules which, when resisted by structures within the axoneme, leads to axonemal bend formation.

One component of the axoneme which may be involved in this control is the <b>central</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> microtubules. To learn more about the action <b>of</b> the <b>central</b> <b>pair,</b> we have studied the tiny uniflagellate marine alga, Micromonas pusilla. The central tubules of the M. pusilla flagellum extend for several micrometres beyond the termination of the peripheral doublets, thus permitting direct observation <b>of</b> the <b>central</b> <b>pair</b> during flagellar movement.

The holotype, MACN-CH-869, is composed of a semi-complete mandible; isolated upper and lower teeth are also known. The jaw is short and deep, bearing an unfused subvertical dentary symphysis and dorsally positioned masseteric fossa.

50|$|Although the {{placement}} of the Plesiadapis lineage is still up for debate, the current consensus is that they are closest to early tarsier-like primates. Plesiadapiformes have also been proposed as a nonprimate sister group to Eocene-Recent primates. A study done in 1987 linked Plesiadapiformes with adapids and omomyids through nine shared-derived features, six of which are cranial or dental: (1) auditory bulla inflated and formed by the petrosal bone, (2) ectotympanic expanded laterally and fused medially to the wall of the bulla, (3) promontorium centrally positioned in the bulla, and large hypotympanic sinus widely separating promontorium from the basisphenoid, (4) internal carotid entering the bulla posteriolaterally and enclosed in a bony tube, (5) nannopithex fold on the upper molars, and (6) loss <b>of</b> one <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>incisors.</b>|$|R
