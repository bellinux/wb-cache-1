5|$|The Marshall Islands were {{represented}} by a male athlete and a female athlete in athletics at the 2008 Summer Olympics, Roman William <b>Cress</b> and Haley Nemra. This was the first appearance for either athlete at the Olympics. Neither Nemara or <b>Cress</b> met the qualification criteria for their events, however they were accepted as wildcard entries into the Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Both athletes {{failed to}} advance to their next rounds, with Simeon placing eighth in his heat {{with a time of}} 11:81, and <b>Cress</b> placing sixth with a time of 13:20. Jamaica and the United States won medals in both competitions, and Canada {{received}} one for the men's event.|$|E
5|$|Roman <b>Cress</b> {{competed in}} the men's 100 meters, where he {{finished}} eighth out of the nine athletes in his heat, failing {{to advance to the}} next round. The medals in the event went to athletes from Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and the United States.|$|E

5|$|Ailanthus {{produces}} an allelopathic chemical called ailanthone, which inhibits {{the growth of}} other plants. The inhibitors are strongest in the bark and roots, but are also present in the leaves, wood and seeds of the plant. One study showed that a crude extract of the root bark inhibited 50% of a sample of garden <b>cress</b> (Lepidium sativum) seeds from germinating. The same study tested the extract as an herbicide on garden <b>cress,</b> redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti), yellow bristlegrass (Setaria pumila), barnyard grass (Echinochloa crusgalli), pea (Pisum sativum cv. Sugar Snap) and maize (Zea mays cv. Silver Queen). It proved able to kill nearly 100% of seedlings {{with the exception of}} velvetleaf, which showed some resistance. Another experiment showed a water extract of the chemical was either lethal or highly damaging to 11 North American hardwoods and 34 conifers, with the white ash (Fraxinus americana) being the only plant not adversely affected. The chemical does not, however, affect the tree of heaven's own seedlings, indicating that A. altissima has a defence mechanism to prevent autotoxicity. Resistance in various plant species has been shown to increase with exposure. Populations without prior exposure to the chemicals are most susceptible to them. Seeds produced from exposed plants have also been shown to be more resistant than their unexposed counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Fear of a Black Planet {{features}} elaborate sound collages {{that incorporate}} varying rhythms, numerous samples, media sound bites, and eccentric loops, reflecting the songs' confrontational tone. Recorded during {{the golden age}} of hip hop, its assemblage of reconfigured and recontextualized aural sources preceded the sample clearance system that later emerged in the music industry. Fear of a Black Planet explores themes about organization and empowerment within the black community, social issues affecting African Americans, and race relations at the time. The record's criticism of institutional racism, White supremacy, and the power elite was partly inspired by Dr. Frances <b>Cress</b> Welsing's views on color.|$|E
5|$|A {{considerable}} amount of new knowledge about plant function comes from studies of the molecular genetics of model plants such as the Thale <b>cress,</b> Arabidopsis thaliana, a weedy species in the mustard family (Brassicaceae). The genome or hereditary information contained in the genes of this species is encoded by about 135 million base pairs of DNA, forming {{one of the smallest}} genomes among flowering plants. Arabidopsis was the first plant to have its genome sequenced, in 2000. The sequencing of some other relatively small genomes, of rice (Oryza sativa) and Brachypodium distachyon, has made them important model species for understanding the genetics, cellular and molecular biology of cereals, grasses and monocots generally.|$|E

5|$|Aisea Tohi {{represented}} Tonga at the Beijing Olympics {{in track}} and field. Born on Tonga's main island of Tongatapu in the settlement of Tofua, attended the Beijing Olympics at 21 years old, participating in the men's 100meters dash. Tohi had not previously competed in any Olympic games. During {{the course of his}} event's qualification round, which took place on August 14, Tohi was placed in the second heat against seven other athletes. He finished the race in 11.17seconds, placing seventh in his heat ahead of Roman William <b>Cress</b> from the Marshall Islands (11.18seconds) and behind Béranger Bosse of the Central African Republic (10.51seconds). The leaders of Tohi's heat included Jamaica's Asafa Powell (10.16seconds) as well as Kim Collins of Saint Kitts and Nevis (10.17seconds). Of the 80 athletes participating in the qualification round, Tohi placed 71st. He did not advance to later rounds.|$|E
5|$|The steep {{walls of}} the gorge support some rare fauna and flora, {{including}} species unique to the gorge. There are a total of 24 rare plant species and two unique trees: the Bristol and Wilmotts's whitebeams. Other notable plants include Bristol rock <b>cress,</b> Bristol onion, spiked speedwell, autumn squill and honewort. Because of its steep sides, there are {{many parts of the}} gorge on which trees cannot grow, making way for smaller plants. The gorge is also home to rare invertebrate species. The gorge has a microclimate around 1 degree warmer than the surrounding land. The steep south-west facing sides receive the afternoon sunlight, but are partially sheltered from the prevailing winds. When winds come from the Bristol Channel in the north west they may be funnelled into the gorge, creating harsh and wet conditions.|$|E
5|$|Females usually {{engage with}} several males over a {{breeding}} season. The eggs are fertilised internally in the oviduct. The female deposits them individually on leaves of aquatic plants, {{such as water}} <b>cress</b> or floating sweetgrass, usually close to the surface, and, using her hindlegs, folds the leaf around the eggs as protection from predators and radiation. In the absence of suitable plants, the eggs may also be deposited on leaf litter, stones, or even plastic bags. In the northern crested newt, a female takes around five minutes for the deposition of one egg. Crested newt females usually lay around 200 eggs per season, while the marbled newt (T. marmoratus) can lay up to 400. Triturus embryos are usually light-coloured, 1.8–2mm in diameter with a 6mm jelly capsule, which distinguishes them from eggs of other co-existing newt species that are smaller and darker-coloured. A genetic particularity in the genus causes 50% of the embryos to die: their development is arrested {{when they do not}} possess two different variants of chromosome 1 (i.e., when they are homozygous for that chromosome).|$|E

25|$|Arriving {{just moments}} after they first left, <b>Cress</b> {{and his companions}} join Chester in his fight against Dhaos and {{seemingly}} defeat him for good. However, they are approached by a traveler named Harrisson from 50 {{years in the future}} who tells them that Dhaos is now ravaging the world in his time. Using the Thor machine once again, the team arrives in the new period where they meet a ninja named Suzu who accompanies them (except in the original release). After meeting with a group of elves, <b>Cress</b> obtains the legendary Eternal Sword, {{the only thing that can}} stop Dhaos from moving through time, and travel to his invisible fortress for the final confrontation. After finally defeating him, the party learns from a tree spirit named Martel that he is a visitor from a dying planet called Derris Karran, whose world was slowly withering due to the death of its world tree, the source of all mana and lifeblood of everything in it. Attempting to obtain a seed from this planet's world tree, Yggdrasil, Dhaos instead found that its power was fading as well due to the humans' constant misuse of mana-based technology, and decided to wipe them out to save it. As the party members realize that by saving their world they have doomed his, Martel takes pity on their plight and sends a mana seed into space in an attempt to rejuvenate Derris-Kharlan's tree as <b>Cress</b> and his team return to their proper times.|$|E

50|$|During {{the reign}} of King Edward II the Templar order was {{suppressed}} in England, with their estate at <b>Cressing</b> being {{handed over to the}} Order of the Knights Hospitaller in 1309, who preserved the Templar documents and charters of <b>Cressing</b> amongst their own records. The manor, controlled by a prior of the Knights Hospitaller, continued to work as a large estate. It was targeted in 1381 during the Peasants' Revolt, when on Monday 10 June a large group of rebels attacked <b>Cressing</b> and carried away armour, vestments, gold and silver, and other goods to the value of £20 belonging to the Hospitallers, and burned books to the value of 20 marks. The Hospitaller manor of <b>Cressing</b> Temple was dissolved in 1540, soon after the last monasteries, and on 8 July 1541, King Henry VIII granted the manor and lordship of <b>Cressing</b> and the half-hundred of Witham to Sir William Huse and John Smyth, one of the barons of the Exchequer. John Smyth's family held the manor until 1657. Following the Reformation, in the late 16th Century there was a mansion on the site, now called the 'Great House', but it was demolished in the 18th Century and only the farmhouse, granary, wagon lodge and stable yards remain. The mid-Sixteenth century Tudor brick garden also stands and has been developed by Essex County Council who acquired the barns for the people of Essex in 1987. The farmhouse dates from 1618, and the coach house from 1800. Extensive archaeological investigations were carried out as part of a programme of improvements and updates in the 1990s.|$|R

25|$|The game {{begins as}} four heroes {{are locked in}} battle with a {{powerful}} sorcerer king named Dhaos. Before he can be defeated, Dhaos uses his magic to travel several years into the future, where he is immediately met {{by one of the}} four warriors' descendants and three companions, who seal him away with two magic pendants. Twelve years later, two young men named <b>Cress</b> and Chester return to their village to find it razed to the ground by a dark knight named Mars, whose army kills many of it inhabitants including Cress's parents and Chester's sister. While Chester stays behind to bury them, <b>Cress</b> leaves to meet his uncle Olson for help, who reveals that he is being forced to work for Mars before stealing his father's pendant and locking him in jail.

5000|$|The manor of <b>Cressing</b> {{was granted}} to the Knights Templar in 1136 by Matilda of Boulogne, [...] the wife of King Stephen close to the main road between London and Colchester, and the road between Witham and Braintree. The Templar estate {{received}} further grants soon after its founding {{in the form of}} the manor and half-hundred of Witham sometime between 1138 and 1148, although the church of Witham, which had previously been {{granted to the}} church of St Martin's Le Grand in London, was not included. The Preceptory of <b>Cressing</b> was therefore one of the very earliest Templar estates in England, and was placed first in a detailed list of Templar holdings in 1185. It was the largest of their estates in Essex. Later, King John confirmed to the Templars at <b>Cressing</b> the land of Berecholt on 14 July 1199, and the land of Newland on 8 June 1214, as well as a market on Thursdays and a three-day-long fair at the feast of the Decollation of St. John the Baptist at the new town of Wulnesforde in the parish of Witham.
