5|$|The use of <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> blockers, {{thought to}} be able to prevent the spasm of blood vessels by {{preventing}} calcium from entering smooth muscle cells, has been proposed for prevention. The <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> blocker nimodipine when taken by mouth improves outcome if given between the fourth and twenty-first day after the bleeding, even if it does not reduce the amount of vasospasm detected on angiography. In traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, nimodipine does not affect long-term outcome, and is not recommended. Other <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> blockers and magnesium sulfate have been studied, but are not presently recommended; neither is there any evidence that shows benefit if nimodipine is given intravenously.|$|E

25|$|Like {{voltage-gated}} sodium <b>channels,</b> voltage-gated <b>calcium</b> <b>channels</b> {{are also}} integral membrane proteins {{found in the}} plasma membrane. Voltage-gated <b>calcium</b> <b>channels</b> generate action potentials by the same mechanisms as voltage-gated sodium <b>channels.</b> Various voltage-gated <b>calcium</b> <b>channels</b> {{have been identified in}} neurons. N- and P/Q-type voltage-gated <b>calcium</b> <b>channels</b> are the primary subtypes found to support synaptic transmission. These channels are concentrated at nerve terminals. T-type and R-type voltage-gated <b>calcium</b> <b>channels</b> have been found in basal dendrites, and it is thought that the activation of these channels during action potential bursts lead to the generation of dendritic calcium spikes.

To prepare a number of MVIIC analogues efficiently, we developed a combinatorial method which includes a random air oxidation step.

25|$|The {{basis for}} this broader {{spectrum}} of activity of lamotrigine is unknown, but could relate to actions of the drug on voltage-activated <b>calcium</b> <b>channels.</b> Lamotrigine blocks T-type <b>calcium</b> <b>channels</b> weakly, if at all. However, it does inhibit native and recombinant high-voltage–activated <b>calcium</b> <b>channels</b> (N- and P/Q/R-types) at therapeutic concentrations. Whether this activity on <b>calcium</b> <b>channels</b> accounts for lamotrigine's broader clinical spectrum of activity in comparison with phenytoin and carbamazepine remains to be determined.|$|R
5|$|The {{condition}} {{has been}} linked with genetic mutations in genes that code for certain ion channels that transport electrolytes (sodium and potassium) across cell membranes. The main ones are the L-type <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> α1-subunit and potassium inward rectifier 2.6; it is therefore classified as a channelopathy. The abnormality in the channel is thought to lead to shifts of potassium into cells, under conditions of high thyroxine (thyroid hormone) levels, usually with an additional precipitant.|$|E
5|$|Antioxidants, such as {{vitamins}} C and E, {{have been}} proposed {{to protect against the}} disease, but results of studies have been contradictory and no positive effect has been proven. The results regarding fat and fatty acids have been contradictory, with various studies reporting protective effects, risk-increasing effects or no effects. There have been preliminary indications that the use of anti-inflammatory drugs and <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> blockers may be protective. A 2010 meta-analysis found that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (apart from aspirin), have been associated with at least a 15 percent (higher in long-term and regular users) reduction of incidence of the development of Parkinson's disease.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{mutations}} in the L-type <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> α1-subunit (Cav1.1) {{have been described}} in Southern Chinese with TPP. The mutations are located in {{a different part of}} the gene from those described in the related condition familial periodic paralysis. In TPP, the mutations described are single-nucleotide polymorphisms located in the hormone response element responsive to thyroid hormone, implying that transcription of the gene and production of ion channels may be altered by increased thyroid hormone levels. Furthermore, mutations have been reported in the genes coding for potassium voltage-gated channel, Shaw-related subfamily, member 4 (Kv3.4) and sodium channel protein type 4 subunit alpha (Na41.4).|$|E

5|$|Investigations on neuroprotection {{are at the}} {{forefront}} of PD research. Several molecules have been proposed as potential treatments. However, none of them have been conclusively demonstrated to reduce degeneration. Agents currently under investigation include anti-apoptotics (omigapil, CEP-1347), antiglutamatergics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (selegiline, rasagiline), promitochondrials (coenzyme Q10, creatine), <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> blockers (isradipine) and growth factors (GDNF). Preclinical research also targets alpha-synuclein. A vaccine that primes the human immune system to destroy alpha-synuclein, PD01A (developed by Austrian company, Affiris), has entered clinical trials in humans.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} venom {{is thought to}} have {{provided}} the catalyst for the rapid diversification of snakes in the Cenozoic period, particularly to the Colubridae and their colonization of the Americas. Scholars suggest that the reason for this huge expansion was the shift from a mechanical to a biochemical method of subduing prey. Snake venoms attack biological pathways and processes that are also targeted by venoms of other taxa; for instance, <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> blockers have been found in snakes, spiders, and cone snails, thus suggesting that venom exhibits convergent evolution.|$|E
5|$|Treatment is by prompt {{neurosurgery}} or radiologically guided interventions. Medications such as labetalol may {{be required}} to lower the blood pressure until repair can occur. Efforts to treat fevers are also recommended. Nimodipine, a <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> blocker, is frequently used to prevent vasospasm. Routine use medications to prevent further seizures is of unclear benefit. Nearly half of people with a SAH due to an underlying aneurysm die within 30 days and about a third who survive have ongoing problems. 10–15 percent die before reaching a hospital.|$|E
40|$|Thalamocortical in vivo and {{in vitro}} {{function}} was studied in mice lacking P/Q-type <b>calcium</b> <b>channels</b> (CaV 2. 1), in which N-type <b>calcium</b> <b>channels</b> (CaV 2. 2) supported central synaptic transmission. Unexpectedly, in vitro patch recordings from thalamic neurons demonstrated no γ-band subthreshold oscillation, and voltage-sensitive dye imaging demonstrated {{an absence of}} cortical γ-band-dependent columnar activation involving cortical inhibitory interneuron activity. In vivo electroencephalogram recordings showed persistent absence status and a dramatic reduction of γ-band activity. Pharmacological block of T-type <b>calcium</b> <b>channels</b> (CaV 3), although not noticeably affecting normal control animals, left the knockout mice in a coma-like state. Hence, although N-type <b>calcium</b> <b>channels</b> can rescue P/Q-dependent synaptic transmission, P/Q <b>calcium</b> <b>channels</b> are essential in the generation of γ-band activity and resultant cognitive function...|$|R
50|$|There are two {{voltage-gated}} <b>calcium</b> <b>channels</b> within cardiac muscle: L-type <b>calcium</b> <b>channels</b> ('L' for Long-lasting) and T-type <b>calcium</b> <b>channels</b> ('T' for Transient, i.e. short). L-type {{channels are}} more common and are most densely populated within the t-tubule membrane of ventricular cells, whereas the T-type channels are found mainly within atrial and pacemaker cells, but still {{to a lesser degree}} than L-type channels.|$|R

5|$|The {{triggers}} for precipitation of {{uric acid}} {{are not well}} understood. While it may crystallize at normal levels, {{it is more likely}} to do so as levels increase. Other triggers believed to be important in acute episodes of arthritis include cool temperatures, rapid changes in uric acid levels, acidosis, articular hydration and extracellular matrix proteins, such as proteoglycans, collagens and chondroitin sulfate. The increased precipitation at low temperatures partly explains why the joints in the feet are most commonly affected. Rapid changes in uric acid may occur due to factors including trauma, surgery, chemotherapy, diuretics and stopping or starting allopurinol. <b>Calcium</b> <b>channel</b> blockers and losartan are associated with a lower risk of gout compared to other medications for hypertension.|$|E
5|$|For {{diseases}} of the heart rate or rhythm, {{a number of different}} antiarrhythmic agents are used. These may interfere with electrolyte channels and thus the cardiac action potential (such as <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> blockers, sodium channel blockers), interfere with stimulation of the heart by the sympathetic nervous system (beta blockers), or interfere with the movement of sodium and potassium across the cell membrane, such as digoxin. Other examples include atropine for slow rhythms, and amiodarone for irregular rhythms. Such medications are not the only way of treating {{diseases of}} heart rate or rhythm. In the context of a new-onset irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation), immediate electrical cardioversion may be attempted. For a slow heartbeat or heart block, a pacemaker or defibrillator may be inserted. The acuity of onset often affects how a rhythm disturbance is managed, as does whether a rhythm causes hemodynamic instability, such as low blood pressure or symptoms. An instigating cause is investigated for, such as a heart attack, medication, or metabolic problem.|$|E
25|$|Nifedipine is a <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> blocker. Although {{nifedipine}} {{and other}} dihydropyridines are commonly regarded as {{specific to the}} L-type <b>calcium</b> <b>channel,</b> they also possess nonspecific activity towards other voltage-dependent calcium channels.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{experiments}} {{was to investigate the}} pharmacological action of a toxin from the spider Phoneutria nigriventer, Tx 3 - 3, on the function of <b>calcium</b> <b>channels</b> that control exocytosis of synaptic vesicles. Tx 3 - 3, in confirmation of previous work, diminished the intracellular calcium increase induced by membrane depolarization with KCl (25 [*]mM) in rat cerebrocortical synaptosomes. The toxin was very potent (IC 50 0. 9 [*]nM) at inhibiting <b>calcium</b> <b>channels</b> that regulate <b>calcium</b> entry in synaptosomes. In addition, Tx 3 - 3 blocked the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles, as measured with the fluorescent dye FM 1 - 43. Using ω-toxins that interact selectively with distinct neuronal <b>calcium</b> <b>channels,</b> we investigated whether the target of Tx 3 - 3 overlaps with known channels that mediate exocytosis. The results indicate that the main population of voltage-sensitive <b>calcium</b> <b>channels</b> altered by Tx 3 - 3 can also be inhibited by ω-agatoxin IVA, an antagonist of P/Q <b>calcium</b> <b>channels.</b> ω-conotoxin GVIA, which inhibits N type <b>calcium</b> <b>channels</b> did not decrease significantly the entry of calcium or exocytosis of synaptic vesicles in depolarized synaptosomes. It is concluded that Tx 3 - 3 potently inhibits ω-agatoxin IVA-sensitive <b>calcium</b> <b>channels,</b> which are involved in controlling exocytosis in rat brain cortical synaptosomes...|$|R

25|$|The {{mechanism}} by which ethosuximide affects neuronal excitability includes block of T-type calcium channels, and may include effects of the drug on other classes of ion channel. The primary finding that ethosuximide is a T-type <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> blocker gained widespread support, but initial attempts to replicate the finding were inconsistent. Subsequent experiments on recombinant T-type channels in cell lines demonstrated conclusively that ethosuximide blocks all T-type <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> isoforms. Significant T-type <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> density occurs in dendrites of neurons, and recordings from reduced preparations that strip away this dendritic source of T-type calcium channels {{may have contributed to}} reports of ethosuximide ineffectiveness.|$|E

40|$|AbstractExtremely low-frequency {{electromagnetic}} fields (ELF-EMF) causes various biological effects through altering intracellular calcium homeostasis. The role of high voltage-gated (HVA) <b>calcium</b> <b>channels</b> in ELF-EMF induced effects {{has been extensively}} studied. However, the effect of ELF-EMF on low-voltage-gated (LVA) T-type <b>calcium</b> <b>channels</b> has not been reported. In this study, we test the effect of ELF-EMF (50 Hz) on human T-type <b>calcium</b> <b>channels</b> transfected in HEK 293 cells. Conversely to its stimulant effects on HVA channels, ELF-EMF exposure inhibited all T-type (Cav 3. 1, Cav 3. 2 and Cav 3. 3) channels. Neither the protein expression nor the steady-state activation and inactivation kinetics of Cav 3. 2 channels were altered by ELF-EMF (50 Hz, 0. 2 mT) exposure. Exposure to ELF-EMF increased both arachidonic acid (AA) and leukotriene E 4 (LTE 4) levels in HEK 293 cells. CAY 10502 and bestatin, which block the increase of AA and LTE 4 respectively, abrogated the ELF-EMF inhibitory effect on Cav 3. 2 channels. Exogenous LTE 4 mimicked the ELF-EMF inhibition of T-type <b>calcium</b> <b>channels.</b> ELF-EMF (50 Hz) inhibits native T-type <b>calcium</b> <b>channels</b> in primary cultured mouse cortical neurons via LTE 4. We conclude that 50 Hz ELF-EMF inhibits T-type <b>calcium</b> <b>channels</b> through AA/LTE 4 signaling pathway...|$|R
