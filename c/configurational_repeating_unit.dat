50|$|A tactic {{macromolecule}} in the IUPAC {{definition is}} a macromolecule in which essentially all the <b>configurational</b> (<b>repeating)</b> <b>units</b> are identical. Tacticity is particularly significant in vinyl polymers {{of the type}} -H2C-CH(R)- where each <b>repeating</b> <b>unit</b> with a substituent R {{on one side of}} the polymer backbone is followed by the next <b>repeating</b> <b>unit</b> with the substituent on the same side as the previous one, the other side as the previous one or positioned randomly with respect to the previous one. In a hydrocarbon macromolecule with all carbon atoms making up the backbone in a tetrahedral molecular geometry, the zigzag backbone is in the paper plane with the substituents either sticking out of the paper or retreating into the paper. This projection is called the Natta projection after Giulio Natta. Monotactic macromolecules have one stereoisomeric atom per <b>repeat</b> <b>unit,</b> ditactic to n-tactic macromolecules have more than one stereoisomeric atom per unit.|$|R

Polystyrene has a chain where the substituent R is a phenyl group (C6H5), corresponding to a benzene ring minus one hydrogen: -CH2-CH(C6H5)n-, so the <b>repeat</b> <b>unit</b> is -CH2-CH(C6H5)-.|$|R

For example, in nylon-6,6, the <b>repeat</b> <b>unit</b> contains the two monomeric units —NH(CH2)6NH— and —OC(CH2)4CO—, so that a chain of 1000 monomeric units corresponds to 500 <b>repeat</b> <b>units.</b> The degree of polymerization or chain length is then 1000 by the first (IUPAC) definition, but 500 by the second.|$|R
40|$|The genus Rattus has {{two related}} {{families}} of satellite DNA: Satellite I consists of tandem arrays of a 370 base pair <b>repeat</b> <b>unit</b> {{which is a}} dimer of two 185 base pair portions (a, b) which are about 60 % homologous. Satellite I' consists of tandem arrays of a 185 base pair <b>repeat</b> <b>unit</b> (a') which is about 85 % homologous to a and 60 % homologous to b. R. norvegicus contains only satellite I but R. rattus contains both satellites I and I'. We examined certain aspects of satellite DNA evolution by comparing the spacing at which variant <b>repeat</b> <b>units</b> of each satellite have spread among non-variant <b>repeat</b> <b>units</b> in these two species. With but one exception, in R. rattus, 15 different variant <b>repeat</b> <b>units</b> have spread among non-variant <b>repeat</b> <b>units</b> of satellite I, with a spacing equal {{to the length of}} the (a,b) dimer. Similarly, fourteen different variant <b>repeat</b> <b>units</b> of the monomeric satellite I' have mixed among non-variant <b>repeat</b> <b>units</b> with a spacing equal to the length of the (a') monomer. These results suggest that a mechanism involving homologous interaction among satellite sequences could account for the spread of variant family members. We also found that a sequence variant present in certain portions of the dimeric <b>repeat</b> <b>unit</b> of satellite I is more efficiently amplified (or less efficiently corrected) than variants occurring in other regions.

A novel Plasmodium falciparum gene, denoted cg 2 gene, {{has been}} {{recently}} discovered, and a distinct genotype, characterized by 12 point mutations and 3 size polymorphisms, {{has been shown}} to be associated with chloroquine resistance in laboratory-adapted parasite strains. One of the polymorphic regions, denoted the omega region, consists of 16 tandem <b>repeat</b> <b>units</b> in chloroquine-resistant strains, while the chloroquine-sensitive strains have either # 15 or $ 17 <b>repeat</b> <b>units.</b> In this study, the in vivo and in vitro responses were compared with the number of <b>repeat</b> <b>units</b> in the omega region of the cg 2 gene for 75 Cameroonian isolates determined either by DNA sequencing or agarose gel electrophoresis. The 16 -repeat units that characterize the resistant strains were found in 10 chloroquine-sensitive isolates (50 % inhibitory concentration [IC 50], 100 nM) and 30 chloroquine-resistant isolates (IC 50 $ 100 nM). Thirty-five isolates (28 chloroquine-sensitive isolates and 7 chloroquine-resistant isolates) displayed # 15 or $ 17 <b>repeat</b> <b>units.</b> Of the 18 patients responding with treatment failure, 15 were infected with parasites carrying 16 <b>repeat</b> <b>units.</b> Twenty-eight patients (11 with isolates carrying 16 <b>repeat</b> <b>units</b> and 17 with isolates carrying # 15 or $ 17 <b>repeat</b> <b>units)</b> showed an adequate clinical response.

A general feature of the <b>repeat</b> <b>units</b> was the presence of termination associated sequence (TAS) motifs. About 50 % of 138 interspecific mutations observed among the D-loop sequences are located 10 bp down- and upstream from these TAS motifs.
