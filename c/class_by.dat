5|$|After the battle, Browning {{was awarded}} the Order of Polonia Restituta (II <b>class)</b> <b>by</b> the Polish government-in-exile, but his {{critical}} evaluation of the contribution of Polish forces led to the removal of Major-General Stanisław Sosabowski as commanding officer of the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade.

Montgomery attached no blame to Browning or any of his subordinates, or indeed acknowledged failure at all. He told Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), the professional head of the British Army, that he would like Browning to take over VIII Corps in the event that Richard O'Connor, the GOC, were transferred to another theatre.|$|E

5|$|Following the McIntosh-Prescott Report, which {{indicated}} the long-term faults {{with the class}} that still required solving, successful {{efforts were made to}} bring the submarines to operational standard. As part of this, a public relations plan was implemented to provide up-to-date information on the submarines to the media, to improve the public perception of the <b>class</b> <b>by</b> providing factual information on the status of the project and responding to queries and incidents. This same period saw the dispelling of the idea, widely held within the RAN, that the Collins-class boats would be like any other vessel previously ordered by the RAN: in service with another navy, well tested, and with all the problems solved before they entered Australian hands. The RAN began to realise that as the parent navy for the class, they had a greater responsibility than normal in ensuring that the boats were at an operational standard.|$|E

5|$|Humphrey first ran {{for mayor}} of Minneapolis in 1943, losing by only six {{thousand}} votes. He campaigned again in the 1945 election, {{with the support of}} the city's labor leaders, and found support with the city's African-American community by promising to implement a city civil rights commission. He also appealed to the city's middle <b>class</b> <b>by</b> giving talks on civic virtue at area churches. He was elected in 1945 by the largest margin to date. When elected, he immediately proposed a city ordinance that would make racial discrimination by employers subject to a fine. After a long period of discussion, the Minneapolis City Council finally approved the ordinance by a 21 to 3 margin on January 31, 1947. The ordinance created the nation's first Fair Employment Practices Ordinance and established Minneapolis as the nation's leader in imposing fines for employment discrimination, though pressure from the local Urban League would also limit employment opportunities for African Americans during the ordinance's first few years.|$|E

5|$|On 10 May 1940, German forces {{launched}} an offensive in Western Europe, but Wick {{remained on the}} ground while his aircraft, Bf 109 Yellow 2, underwent an engine change. Seven days later, {{he was back in}} the air, recording three victories over French LeO 45 bombers in one mission. By 6 June, Wick had 10 confirmed and two unconfirmed victories, including four French Bloch 151/152 fighters that he shot down on 5 June to record his fifth through eighth victories. The two unconfirmed victories were Royal Navy Fairey Swordfish biplane torpedo bombers claimed on 19 May and for which he had no witnesses. On 6 June, Wick became the first pilot of the I. Gruppe to complete 100 combat missions, claiming his ninth and tenth victory the same day. For this achievement he was awarded the Iron Cross 1st <b>Class</b> <b>by</b> Oberstleutnant Harry von Bülow-Bothkamp. By the end of the French Campaign, Wick's total stood at 14 confirmed victories, trailing only Hauptmann (Captain) Mölders of JG53 with 25 victories and Hauptmann Wilhelm Balthasar of JG27 with 23 victories as the Luftwaffes top scorer. At the end of the French campaign, 3. Staffel headquarters moved into the house of Louis Aston Knight, an artist who had fled {{a few days before the}} Germans arrived.|$|E

5|$|The second {{batch of}} ten new-build U class {{locomotives}} was constructed between February and May 1931 when more obsolete locomotives were withdrawn from service. This brought {{the total of}} new-build locomotives to 30, and {{the total number of}} operational U class engines to 50. The new batch also featured detail differences {{from the rest of the}} class, such as the arrangement of the footsteps at the front of the locomotive, though continued to use the standard left-hand drive cab layout to improve the driver’s forward vision from the cab. Smoke deflectors were fitted to the whole class from 1933 to prevent drifting smoke from obscuring forward vision. The smokebox snifting valves applied to the <b>class</b> <b>by</b> Maunsell were removed by his successor Oliver Bulleid, who also fitted U1 class chimneys to improve the draughting.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, center Dakari Johnson {{was named}} National Freshman of the Year by ESPN HS. In the {{following}} months, Okafor beat out Johnson {{for a spot}} on the 2011 FIBA Americas Under-16 Championship Team USA. Okafor spent his sophomore season ranked as the number one center and second best player in the national class of 2014 by SLAM Magazine behind Andrew Wiggins, according to SLAM's Franklyn Calle. In January 2012 during his sophomore season, he was ranked third in the <b>class</b> <b>by</b> ESPNU. By April, he was ranked second. By the end of his second year, there was talk that with Jabari Parker Chicago might produce the number one high school player in the country in back to back years, something that they had come close to with Mark Aguirre and Isiah Thomas in the late 1970s. Also in the 1981 NBA draft Aguirre and Thomas were selected first and second, respectively. On October 25, 2012, Andrew Wiggins reclassified into the class of 2013, which cleared the way for Okafor to assume the number one ranking in the Rivals.com ranking for the class of 2014. As of November 2012, he was listed number one in the national class of 2014 by Rivals.com and number two by ESPN. He remained number one according to Rivals with its March 14, 2013 rankings update, following his junior season.|$|E
5|$|The Bears {{attempted}} to trade quarterback Jay Cutler to the Titans for their #2 overall pick, but Tennessee was not interested. Eventually, the Bears drafted West Virginia receiver Kevin White with the seventh-overall pick; considered the top receiver in the 2015 draft <b>class</b> <b>by</b> NFL.com analyst Mike Mayock, White caught 109 passes for 1,447 yards and 10 touchdowns in 2014. In the second round, Florida State defensive lineman Eddie Goldman was selected; considered a first-round prospect {{who had fallen}} due to his toughness, the 2014 Associated Press All-American recorded 35 tackles, four sacks and eight tackles for loss in his final college season. With their third-rounder, Oregon center Hroniss Grasu was drafted; the 2013 and 2014 Rimington Trophy finalist, the Bears were convinced by guard Kyle Long to draft his former Oregon teammate. With White and Grasu's selections, this {{marked the first time}} since 2008 that the Bears drafted at least two offensive players with their first three picks. In the fourth round, Michigan State running back Jeremy Langford was selected; during his time with Michigan State, he recorded 2,967 rushing yards and 40 touchdowns on 577 carries, while also recording 18 games with 100+ rushing yards, the third-most in school history.
