5|$|Salma feels {{isolated}} {{given that}} her son has moved to Washington, D.C. and her daughters are now married. The local village elder Abu Kamal (Makram Khoury) advises her to give in, but Salma decides {{to work with the}} young lawyer Ziad Daud (Ali Suliman). They take their case {{all the way to the}} Supreme Court. Mira Navon (Rona Lipaz-Michael), the minister's wife, sympathizes with Salma. The court case receives notable media attention, and Mira gives a news interview that her husband regrets. Mira believes that the Israeli military overreacted, and she also shares Salma's sense of personal loneliness. Although they never speak, a complex human bond develops between the two women. As the Palestinian cause is dismissed, Mira decides to leave her husband and a concrete wall is built between Salma's land and the Defense Minister's house. A final <b>camera</b> <b>shot</b> reveals the lemon trees have been pruned.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Wade singing and playing his guitar {{in a hotel}} room. While singing, Wade is seen packing his clothes into a suit case in {{separate}} camera shots. He then leaves the hotel room and it shows a time-lapse scene of a car going down a highway. Then, the video cuts to a restaurant, where Wade is seen lying on a restaurant booth and singing the lyrics of the song. After this, Wade is seen {{with the rest of}} Lifehouse in a concert setting in a restaurant. It then splits to shots of Wade singing the lyrics of the song to the camera. Toward the end of the video, it switches to Lifehouse playing the song in front of a crowd while showing shots of Wade in a car going down a highway. It ends with the scene of Lifehouse in a restaurant and then switches to a <b>camera</b> <b>shot</b> of all of the band members with the video fading out on Wade.|$|E
5|$|Grim Fandango mixed static pre-rendered {{background}} {{images with}} 3D characters and objects. Part {{of this decision}} was based on how the calaca figures would appear in three dimensions. There were more than 90 sets and 50 characters in the game to be created and rendered; Manny's character alone comprised 250 polygons. The development team found that by utilizing three-dimensional models to pre-render the backgrounds, they could alter the <b>camera</b> <b>shot</b> to achieve more effective or dramatic angles for certain scenes simply by re-rendering the background, {{instead of having to}} have an artist redraw the background for a traditional 2D adventure game. The team adapted the engine to allow Manny's head to move separately from his body to make the player aware of important objects nearby. The 3D engine also aided in the choreography between the spoken dialog and body and arm movements of the characters. Additionally, full motion video cutscenes were incorporated to advance the plot, using the same in-game style for the characters and backgrounds to make them nearly indistinguishable from the actual game.|$|E

500|$|While much of {{the prior}} work in {{automated}} virtual camera control systems has been directed towards reducing {{the need for a}} human to manually control the camera, the Director's Lens solution computes and proposes a palette of suggested virtual <b>camera</b> <b>shots</b> leaving the human operator to make the creative shot selection. [...] In computing subsequent suggested virtual <b>camera</b> <b>shots,</b> the system analyzes the visual compositions and editing patterns of prior recorded shots to compute suggested <b>camera</b> <b>shots</b> that conform to continuity conventions such as not crossing the line of action, match placement of virtual characters so they appear to look at one another across cuts, and favors those shots which the human operator had previously used in sequence.|$|R
5|$|On August 29, 2016 (August 29, 1997, {{being the}} date when Skynet becomes self-aware in the films), it was {{announced}} that the film would be digitally remastered in 3D to commemorate its 25th anniversary, with a worldwide re-release planned for summer 2017. The version to be remastered and rereleased in 3D was the original 137 minute theatrical cut, as the extended edition is not James Cameron's preferred version. Only one <b>camera</b> <b>shot</b> from the opening chase sequence was digitally altered to fix a minor continuity error which had bugged Cameron since the 1991 release. DMG Entertainment and Studiocanal worked together with Cameron to convert the film using the StereoD technology. The 3D version premiered on February 17, 2017, at the Berlin International Film Festival, with the theatrical re-release being scheduled for August 25, 2017. Similar to Cameron's Titanic 3D, Lightstorm Entertainment oversaw the work on the 3D version of Terminator 2, which took nearly a year to finish. The film was released by Distrib Films US which typically handles the release of French films. The studio released the film exclusively for one week in AMC Theatres nationwide, and said that it will expand depending on the film's performances in its first week.|$|E

Yet none of the surveyed research has systematically controlled and examined the effect of <b>camera</b> <b>shots</b> on other communication variables. This study was concerned with the effect of differing <b>camera</b> <b>shots</b> on interpersonal attraction. Two professional comedians, used as stimulus objects, performed two comedy routines, each approximately three minutes in length. The two routines were videotaped.

25|$|In the 1940s {{there were}} a spate of film dealing with various aspects of heavenly administration: Here Comes Mr. Jordan (1941), Heaven Can Wait (1943), A Matter of Life and Death (1946) and It’s a Wonderful Life (1946). Beckett {{may or may not}} have seen any of these; at the very least he would have likely read about them. Significantly the opening <b>camera</b> <b>shot</b> of It’s a Wonderful Life dissolves slowly upward into the star-filled, dark night sky where two {{pulsating}} galaxies of light come into view. Two heavenly angels are conversing together in the film's otherworldly opening. In Rough for Theatre II, Bertrand and Morvan take time out to specifically discuss the starry night sky.|$|E
25|$|Pacino {{was injured}} during rehearsals for a gunfight after {{he grabbed the}} barrel of a prop gun which had just been used to fire several dummy bullets. His hand stuck to the hot barrel and he was unable to remove it immediately; the injury sidelined him for two weeks. The gunfight scene also {{includes}} a single <b>camera</b> <b>shot</b> directed by Steven Spielberg, who was visiting the set at the time. During filming, some Cuban-Americans objected to the film's Cuban-American characters being portrayed as criminals by non-Cuban-American actors. To counter this, the film features a disclaimer during its credits stating that the film characters were not representative of the Cuban-American community. The entertainment industry initially hated the film, with actress Liza Minnelli asking Pacino what he had done to leave the insiders subdued at a post-screening meal. (Minnelli had not seen the film at the time.) However, during the meal, actor Eddie Murphy told Pacino that he loved the film.|$|E

500|$|In the show, {{he began}} experimenting with {{techniques}} {{that would change}} the way puppetry had been used on television, including using the frame defined by the <b>camera</b> <b>shot</b> to allow the puppet performer to work from off-camera. Believing television puppets needed to have [...] "life and sensitivity," [...] Henson began making characters from flexible, fabric-covered foam rubber, allowing them to express a wider array of emotions {{at a time when}} many puppets were made of carved wood. A marionette's arms are manipulated by strings, but Henson used rods to move his Muppets' arms, allowing greater control of expression. Additionally, Henson wanted the Muppet characters to [...] "speak" [...] more creatively than was possible for previous puppets—which had seemed to have random mouth movements—so he used precise mouth movements to match the dialogue.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "WALL-E: from {{environmental}} adaption to sentimental nostalgia," [...] Robin Murray and Joseph Heuman explain the important theme of nostalgia in this film. Nostalgia is clearly represented by human artifacts, left behind, that WALL-E collects and cherishes, i.e. Zippo lighters, hubcaps, and plastic sporks. These modern items {{that we use}} out of necessity, are made sentimental {{through the lens of}} the bleak future of Earth. Nostalgia is also expressed through the musical score, as the film opens with a <b>camera</b> <b>shot</b> of outer space that slowly zooms into a waste filled Earth while playing [...] "Put on Your Sunday Clothes", reflecting on simpler and happier times in human history. This film also expresses nostalgia through the longing of nature and the natural world, as it is the sight and feeling of soil, and the plant brought back to the space ship by EVE, that make the captain decide it is time for humans to move back to Earth. WALL-E expresses nostalgia also, by reflecting on romantic themes of older Disney and silent films.|$|E
500|$|When the {{two teams}} played {{for the first time}} at Yankee Stadium, on April 3, Yankee fans started new taunts, saying [...] "The Curse of 1918 is finally over (86 years).

[...] Just a week later, the Red Sox received their World Series rings at Fenway Park before they played the Yankees. All of the Yankees went to the top step of the dugout to applaud the Red Sox accomplishment. During the announcement of the lineups, Red Sox fans reciprocated by giving Yankee closer Mariano Rivera (who had struggled against the Red Sox) a loud, standing ovation, despite their booing of Alex Rodriguez. Rivera laughed and tipped his cap. In New York, the YES Network, the Yankees television network, declined to broadcast it. Instead, a fixed <b>camera</b> <b>shot</b> was focused tightly on correspondent Kimberly Jones as she described in general terms the events surrounding her; afterwards, YES was roundly criticized for the move.

500|$|The video opens, {{looking down}} on Martin who is singing, as he lies on his back on a {{mattress}}. As the <b>camera</b> <b>shot</b> pulls back, the mattress is revealed to be outside. A cyclist cycles past in reverse and Martin leaps up from the mattress. He walks in reverse through a city, out into the suburbs and eventually crossing a railway line [...] and into woods, picking up his suit jacket as he goes. Upon arriving at his car, a black BMW, he gets in and briefly passes out. A woman, at first shown lying unresponsive {{on the ground in}} front of the car, is shown flying back in through the shattered windscreen. The car rolls back up a hill in the woods and through a broken fence, which joins back together as the car passes through it. As the video closes, the couple is shown driving back up the road. It is revealed that Martin's passenger had removed her seat belt, in order to put her jacket on, just before the car accident, causing her death. Irish actress Elaine Cassidy portrays the female passenger.|$|E
500|$|Lasting {{until the}} final day without ever being kicked out or leaving for another reason is treated as an {{impressive}} feat on the series due {{to the level of}} violence and hostility. If the cast members engage in violence towards each other or break other rules, {{they may or may not}} be evicted under the show's policy, which is enforced by the producers. Security guards apparently live in the house behind the scenes as they jump into <b>camera</b> <b>shot</b> to break up the many violent altercations that break out on the series. Beyond the common occurrence of violence and combat, other reasons for the premature exits of cast members have been from bullying, ostracism and alienation from the rest of the housemates, problems at home, court proceedings, or their own narcissism. On some occasions, multiple [...] "bad girls" [...] may wish to leave the show; this has happened in all seasons. If a [...] "bad girl" [...] departs early in the season, a [...] "replacement Bad Girl" [...] is introduced within one or two episodes. The replacement housemate is commonly hazed, aggressed at, and treated with prejudice.|$|E
500|$|Following the game, however, {{controversy}} emerged about a silhouetted <b>camera</b> <b>shot</b> of Prince, projected {{against a}} large sheet by {{a bright light}} {{on the other side}} of the performer. The controversy centered around his guitar, which detractors claimed seemed phallic, and critics stating that it [...] "looked embarrassingly rude, crude and unfortunately placed." [...] Though the guitar has been considered by some an extension of a male player's sexuality (especially highlighted by such artists as Jimi Hendrix, Eddie Van Halen, and even Prince himself), supporters of Prince say that the show did not, in fact, become any more sexually charged than usual, noting that [...] "a guitar at waist level does look like an enormous phallus." [...] ABC late-night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live! responded to this mild controversy by including two satirically pixelized Super Bowl clips on its weekly segment [...] "This Week in Unnecessary Censorship" [...] for the February 9, 2007 episode. The first [...] "censored" [...] clip was the kickoff show introduction for CBS' coverage of the Super Bowl, with the first two letters of [...] "kickoff" [...] blurred out as if [...] "jackoff" [...] were censored, then with a clip of the shadow of Prince playing guitar with the guitar neck blurred out as if an actual penis were being blurred.|$|E

5000|$|The entire {{film was}} shot in a studio (in Arpajon). Jacques Saulnier, another of Resnais's {{longtime}} collaborators, provided elegant and sumptuous set designs, which together with the glamorous costumes designed by Jackie Budin complement the theatrical style of the acting, and frequent use of long <b>camera</b> <b>shots</b> enable a fluid staging of the musical numbers. Various cinematic devices are used both to intensify the characterizations (especially with close-ups and direct-to-camera asides), but also to distance the film spectator from the theatrical experience (e.g. dissolves to achieve characters' exits, overhead <b>camera</b> <b>shots</b> {{for some of the}} ensemble numbers).|$|R
500|$|Lost writer Elizabeth Sarnoff {{explained}} that Michael's storyline in season two is about [...] "what a father {{will do to}} save his son"; she noted [...] "there's nothing worse than what he does". The second episode of season two was originally going to be Sawyer centric, however this was rewritten [...] "at the proverbial last minute" [...] and changed to a Michael centric episode. Perrineau received swimming lessons in preparation for this episode. Perrineau was unaware that his character had been captured by the Others until he was told Michael {{was going to kill}} Ana Lucia and Libby. Perrineau described shooting the scenes in [...] "Two for the Road" [...] where Michael murders Ana Lucia and Libby as a [...] "tough day". The last scene shot of season two was Michael and Walt sailing away from the Island. As it was a long <b>camera</b> <b>shot,</b> Perrineau had to sail the boat so far from the pier, that by the time he returned, all the equipment had already been packed away. He said, [...] "It felt fitting, actually. Like; that's it". Perrineau knew he would be back one day, but as the producers did not reveal any details to him, he did not know when. He was the first actor that left the show as [...] "part of a grander design to come back", and the only one until Emilie de Ravin.|$|E
500|$|The last scene filmed was the film's first, Picard's Borg nightmare. One <b>camera</b> <b>shot</b> begins {{inside the}} iris of Picard's eyeball and pulls {{back to reveal}} the captain aboard a massive Borg ship. The shot {{continues}} to pull back and reveal the exterior of a Borg ship. The scene {{was inspired by a}} New York City production of Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street in which the stage surrounded the audience, giving a sense of realism. The shot was filmed as three separate elements merged with digital effects. The crew used a 50-mm lens {{to make it easier for}} the effects team to dissolve the closeup shots with the other elements. Starting from Stewart's eye, the camera pulled back , requiring the key light to increase in intensity up to 1000footcandles so that there was enough depth to keep the eye sharp. The surface of the stage proved too uneven to accomplish the smooth dolly pullback required by the effects team, who needed a steady shot to blend a computer-generated version of Picard's eye with the pullback. The [...] dolly track was raised off the stage floor and layered with pieces of double-thick birch plywood, chosen for its smooth finish. The entire set for the scene was [...] wide and [...] high; gaps left by the dolly reveal were filled in later digitally. Principal photography finished on July 2, 1996, two days over schedule but still under budget.|$|E
500|$|U2 3D {{production}} {{featured the}} first 3D multiple-camera setup and was shot using every digital 3D camera and recording deck in existence. The crew had {{two days to}} set up the filming equipment before each concert, which required running optical fiber cables and hooking up an electrical generator to supply power at each venue. The filming equipment consisted of nine custom-built 3D rigs. The project's large scale prompted 3ality Digital to work with director James Cameron—their chief competitor at the time. 3ality used their own 3flex TS1 camera rigs for filming, in addition to five Fusion 3D rigs, designed by Cameron and camera operator Vincent Pace. [...] A total of 18 Sony CineAlta HDC-F950 cameras were used for filming, with two cameras on each rig. The cameras were fitted with Zeiss digital zoom lenses, making U2 3D the first 3D film shot using a zoom lens. One of the Fusion 3D camera rigs was used as a Spydercam and became the first 3D aerial camera. [...] The cameras on each rig were spaced eye-distance apart to create a 3D effect in post-production. Using a beam splitter mounted to the camera rig, one <b>camera</b> <b>shot</b> through a 50/50 mirror, while the other shot the image reflected from that mirror. Each rig weighed an average of [...] All of the concert footage was shot with twin-camera setups, except for the two Melbourne shoots, where a single CineAlta camera with a Steadicam was also used to capture close-ups.
