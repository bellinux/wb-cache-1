5000|$|The SK channel gating {{mechanism}} {{is controlled by}} intracellular calcium levels. Calcium enters the cell via voltage activated calcium channels {{as well as through}} NMDA receptors. [...] Calcium does not directly bind to the SK channel. Calcium binds to the protein calmodulin (CaM). When bound to calcium, CaM binds to the CaM-binding domain on the intracellular subunit of the SK channel. When each of the four CaM-binding domain subunits is bound to calmodulin, the SK channel changes conformation. This transitions the channel from a tetramer of monomers to a folded dimer of dimers, which results in rotation of the CaM-binding domains. This rotation causes the mechanical opening of the <b>channel</b> <b>gate.</b> The time constant of SK channel activation is approximately 5 ms.

Three of the six transmembrane regions, S2, S3 and S4, contribute to the activation phase of the channel. Upon depolarization, the S4 region, which is positively charged, is moved {{in response to the}} subsequent positive charge of the depolarization. As a result of S4 movement, the negatively charged regions of S2 and S3 appear to move as well. The movement of these regions causes an opening of the <b>channel</b> <b>gate</b> within regions of S5 and S6. The intracellular regions of the C and N-terminus also {{play a crucial role in}} the activation kinetics of the channel. The two termini interact with one other, as the C-terminus folds around the N-terminus during channel activation. The relative movement between the N- and C- termini greatly aids in producing a conformational change of the channel necessary for channel opening. This interaction between these intracellular regions is believed to be linked with membrane-spanning regions of S1 and S6, and thus aid in the movement of S2, S3, and S4 in opening the channel. Studies on selective mutations knocking out these intracellular termini have been shown to produce larger reductions in speed and probability of channel opening, which indicates their importance in channel activation.|$|E

Site-specific mutations of Phe 168 to a small amino acid resulted in losses of the ATP- and proton-dependent <b>gating,</b> whereas the <b>channel</b> <b>gating</b> was well maintained after mutation to a bulky tryptophan, supporting the steric hindrance effect.

Small residues increased Popen, and displayed long-lasting closures and long-lasting openings.

The C-terminal region that is {{adjacent to the}} <b>channel</b> <b>gate,</b> recognized as the TRP domain, is a molecular determinant of receptor assembly. However, the role of this intracellular domain in channel function remains elusive. Here, we show that replacement of the TRP domain of TRPV 1 with the cognate region of TRPV channels (TRPV 2 -TRPV 6) did not affect receptor assembly and trafficking to the cell surface, although those receptors containing the TRP domain of the distantly related TRPV 5 and TRPV 6 did not display ion channel activity. Notably, functional chimeras exhibited an impaired sensitivity to the activating stimuli, consistent with a significant contribution of this protein domain to channel function. At variance with TRPV 1, voltage-dependent gating of chimeric channels could not be detected {{in the absence of}} capsaicin and/or heat. Biophysical analysis of functional chimeras revealed that the TRP domain appears to act as a molecular determinant of the activation energy of channel gating.

In addition, it allows to separate and clarify the contribution of all MOSFET regions (such as the effective channel, LDD, LOCOS, and LDD subdiffusion under the LOCOS) to the amount of ICP-VL curves.
