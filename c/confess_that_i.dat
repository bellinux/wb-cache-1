25|$|Lienhard’s {{keen sense}} of {{observation}} {{was not limited to}} outward features, but involved his heart and mind as well. Although he respected the indigenous people from the start as the natives of the land, his early comments are not free from the typical ethnocentric views of the whites. Gradually his perspective changed, especially during his stay at Mimal on the Yuba River, where he lived for six months in isolation from white settlers and in close contact with the indigenous peoples of the surrounding villages. Some gathered regularly at his house, observed his activities with interest, traded, or occasionally helped with garden work. They taught him to become a first-rate archer, now and then took him along to their families, and nursed him back to health when he fell ill. Thus Lienhard began to observe their daily life and marveled at their skill in basketry, hunting and fishing. He often joined them in those pursuits and describes their methods of procuring and preparing food. His observations led him to understand that these people had organized their style of life in creative symbiosis with their surroundings, that their customs, though different, were ingenious, and that assessing them from a culturally biased vantage point did not do them justice. His growing understanding was extraordinary and increasingly run counter to the then dominant views. One night in the winter of 1848–49, he overheard his young Indian herdsmen talking of the times before the whites had invaded their valleys and of the ever worsening conditions. “The subdued talk of the Indians caused me to ponder,” he wrote. “In my thoughts I tried to put myself in the position of the Indians; and I wondered whether I would acquiesce if I were driven out of my and my ancestors’ homeland as had been the fate of the poor Indians. I <b>confess</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was overwhelmed by strong feelings of revenge, always coming to the conclusion that I would take revenge on the shameless, greedy invaders in every possible way.” He knew from first-hand experience, however, that cooperation, escape, or resistance could all mean death for indigenous people.|$|E

[...] In 1887 he began his studies for the English Bar, working in the London chambers of W.S.

During these years Lang was largely aloof from religion, but continued churchgoing out of what he termed [...] "hereditary respect". He attended services at the nonconformist City Temple church and sometimes went to St Paul's Cathedral.

I can still see the swing of MacLaren's bat, the great follow-through finishing high and held there with the body poised". In 1902 he saw the Test match against Australia in which Victor Trumper scored a century before lunch and thereby won a permanent place among Cardus's heroes. Cardus first played cricket on rough waste land close to his home in Rusholme; as he matured he developed as an effective medium-paced off break bowler, and for several seasons from 1908 onwards he played as a weekend professional in Manchester league cricket.

[...] Lamb criticized the video's lack of sensitivity and respect for using an army and weapons of destruction to glamorize war, saying, [...] "Does Def Jam, Rihanna's label, need to be reminded that this comes on the heels of sadly sending off an additional 30,000 troops from our country to real war?

[...] However, {{this was not the case}} and it would be [...] "unjustifiable" [...] in terms of the statutes governing the chair if the professor were to lecture on wider topics. In his view, the Vedic literature was [...] "of less importance" [...] and the philosophical literature was [...] "very mystical and abstruse", whereas [...] "the classical or modern" [...] period (the laws, two heroic poems, and the plays) was the [...] "most important". Reminding his readers that he had edited two Sanskrit plays, he stated that the literature of the third period constituted the Sanskrit scriptures, not ("as has hitherto been believed") the Veda, [...] "still less the Rig Veda". He commented that Müller's edition of the Rig Veda was requiring [...] "an expenditure of time, labour, money, and erudition far greater than was ever bestowed on any edition of the Holy Bible", adding that Boden did not intend to [...] "aid in the missionary work by perpetuating and diffusing the obsolescent Vedic Scriptures." [...] He claimed that his own approach to Sanskrit scholarship, with his dictionaries and grammar books, was [...] "suited to English minds", unlike Müller's [...] "continental" [...] and [...] "philosophical" [...] approach, which dealt with texts no longer relevant to modern Hindus that missionaries would not benefit from studying.|$|E

Greg Hernandez said, [...] "Before I go on, I have to <b>confess</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was a die-hard fan of Knots Landing, the series on which Joan played sweet Valene Ewing for 14 years. Her character of Valene was a best-selling author but her personal life was always a mess. She had her husband, Gary, stolen by another woman then got pregnant by him, her twin babies were kidnapped by a crooked doctor, she was given a drug overdose at gunpoint by her ex-husband's fiancee, and she racked up enough marriages to give Elizabeth Taylor a run for her money. But she and Gary Ewing (Ted Shackleford) made for one of television's most beloved couples and the audience never stopped rooting {{for them to get}} back together. Joan keeps in touch with Ted (pictured with Joan, above at a [...] "Knots" [...] reunion a few years back), Michelle Lee - who played her best friend Karen - and the great stage star Julie Harris who played her mother." [...] Knots Landing itself has experienced a tremendous fan following and dedication. Van Ark said of this, [...] "It’s amazing. It’s like having friends everywhere in the United States. I heard that a group a fans from London were coming in just to see us at this (autograph convention). We get a lot of fan mail from Europe – France, Germany, Russia.

2500|$|Parnell's {{personal}} complexities or his {{perception of}} a need for political expediency to his goal permitted him to condone radical republican and the atheist Charles Bradlaugh, while he associated himself with {{the hierarchy of the}} Catholic Church. Parnell was a close friend and political associate of fellow land reform activist Thomas Nulty, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Meath, until Parnell's divorce crisis in 1889. Charles Parnell was linked both with the landed aristocracy class and the Irish Republican Brotherhood, with speculation in the 1890s that he may have even joined the latter organisation. The historian Andrew Roberts argues that he was sworn into the IRB in the Old Library at Trinity College Dublin in May 1882 and that this was concealed for 40 years. In Barry O'Brien's Parnell, X, Fenian Parliamentarian John O'Connor Power, relates, 'And, in fact, I was, about this time , deputed to ask Parnell to join us. I did ask him. He said [...] "No" [...] without a moment's hesitation.' He was conservative by nature, leading some historians to suggest that personally he would have been closer to the Conservative rather than to the Liberal Party, but for political needs. Andrew Kettle, Parnell's right-hand man, who shared a lot of his opinions, wrote of his own views, [...] "I <b>confess</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> felt , and still feel, a greater leaning towards the British Tory party than I ever could have towards the so-called Liberals." [...] In later years, the double effect of the Phoenix Park trauma and the O'Shea affair reinforced the conservative side of his nature.|$|E
2500|$|Upon hearing {{news of the}} speech, Paul Cravath, Chairman of the Board of Trustees, asked McKenzie for a report. On June 8, 1925, McKenzie {{forwarded}} Cravath a six-page letter {{addressing the}} matter. McKenzie recognized the ramifications of Du Bois's address. [...] "The whole situation {{is one that is}} very serious indeed", and reported after the speech, [...] "the audience was tumultuous in its applause and so carried away that it seemed to almost trample over Mrs. McKenzie and me after the address." [...] McKenzie acknowledged that [...] "the dominant view of the colored people today is more or less sympathetic with Dr. Du Bois on the race issue," [...] and conceded that today [...] "nothing is so popular with colored audiences as denunciation of the whites, and nothing so unpopular as its absence." [...] But McKenzie refuted Du Bois' accusations that were [...] "not more than partially true." [...] He learned that at the first of the two concerts [...] "the manager of the Auditorium helped in the sale of tickets and not very tactfully turned the colored people to one window, her object being to get two streams of people in accordance with their destination. This matter was brought to my attention that night by one of our alumni and the situation was changed the next morning." [...] He further noted that [...] "we recently widened the amount of space allowed the colored people, so much so that at the last concert, in May, hundreds of white people overflowed into the colored section, mingling indiscriminately with the colored people." [...] Shortly after Du Bois's speech, Fisk trustees drafted a formal letter vigorously supporting the policies McKenzie pursued at Fisk." [...] However, Fisk trustee William DeBerry, the Black leader of St. John's Congregational Church in Springfield, Massachusetts, one of the largest Black Congregational churches in the United States, refused to sign the letter. DeBerry told Wood, [...] "I must <b>confess</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> share to some extent with many others of the Fisk alumni in a grave anxiety and fear as to the ultimate outcome of what they consider an ultra conciliatory attitude on the part of Dr. McKenzie toward southern sentiment as regards the Negro problem."

2500|$|A {{rebellion}} in Ireland broke {{out at the}} end of May, with a friend in Ireland writing to Fitzwilliam that his Irish estate was [...] "the seat of war and {{rebellion in}} this part of the county". Fitzwilliam believed the origin of the rebellion was to be found in the spread of Jacobinism after his recall as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and that the solution was [...] "a fundamental change of system" [...] there. Fitzwilliam voted with the Foxites in the debates on the issue and completed his progress back to joining them. The next year he also opposed the Union between Britain and Ireland and that [...] "the measure cannot be carried but by the length of the sword. It cannot be an Union of consent on the part of Ireland. On 19 March 1799 he led the opposition in the Lords and said Emancipation should be enacted without Union because: [...] "Did anyone at this time of day believe that the family of the Stuarts would be supported by the Catholics?" [...] In 1800 he spoke again, declaring that he would support a Union but only if it would really unite the two kingdoms together, and that the penal laws were [...] "framed against a particular description of persons which now ceased to exist: they were directed against superstition, bigotry and disloyalty; and therefore should not affect the liberal, the well-meaning, and the loyal Catholics of the present day". Fox wrote to a friend on 6 December 1799 that Fitzwilliam and Lord Holland were the only [...] "two who have from me every degree of good will and affection". However, in February 1800 Fitzwilliam openly disagreed with Fox's desire for peace with France because the national interest called for a prosecution of the war at least until the enemy accepted the status quo ante bellum, although he criticised the government for conduct of it. Writing to Laurence on 2 August and 26 October Fitzwilliam changed his position on the war in the light of Austria (Britain's remaining ally) making peace with France: [...] "I am ready to <b>confess</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do not see how war without Continental alliances can tend to produce a counter-revolutionary system in France". France under the rule of Napoleon was in Fitzwilliam's view was less revolutionary: [...] "He may continue the use of revolutionary jargon, but he will check all revolutionary practices. He may gratify his lust of glory by subjugating kingdoms and nations, but he will subvert the roders of things in them no more than is necessary for his first purpose. ... people have seen that, after all, revolutions are but a lottery for power, the people...are left worse than they were found, having been fleeced of everything valuable. From the result of the consideration, then, I am inclined to think peace desirable".|$|E

Roger Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of 4, noting [...] "Baz Luhrmann dreamed of making the Australian Gone with the Wind, and so he has, with much of that film's lush epic beauty and some of the same awkwardness with a national legacy of racism". David Ansen, in his review for Newsweek, wrote, [...] "Kidman seems to blossom under Luhrmann's direction: she's funny, warm and charming, and the erotic charge between her and the gruff, hunky Jackman is delicious. In a solemn season, Australias bold, kitschy, unapologetic artifice is a welcome respite". In her review for the New York Times, Manohla Dargis wrote, [...] "this creation story about modern Australia is a testament to movie love at its most devout, cinematic spectacle at its most extreme, and kitsch as an act of aesthetic communion". Andrew Sarris, in his review for the New York Observer, wrote, [...] "Australia is clearly a labor of love, and a matter of national pride. It is also a bit of a mess. I must <b>confess</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> might have been harder on Mr Luhrmann's film if I had not remained entranced by Ms Kidman ever since I first saw her in Phillip Noyce's Dead Calm in 1989; in my opinion, she has lost none of her luster in the 20 years since". In his review for Time, Richard Schickel wrote, [...] "Have you seen everything Australia has on offer a dozen times before? Sure you have. It's a movie less created by director and co-writer Baz Luhrmann than assembled, Dr Frankenstein-style, from the leftover body parts of earlier movies. Which leaves us asking this question: How come it is so damnably entertaining?" [...] Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal, opines that, [...] "in its heart of hearts Australia is an old-fashioned Western - a Northern, if you will - and all the more enjoyable for it." [...] Nick Rogers, of FilmYap, adds that, [...] "Luhrmann mythologized his homeland as American directors like John Ford did with Westerns — dramatic-license exaggerations that pay off in droves." [...] Ann Hornaday, in her review for the Washington Post, wrote, [...] "A wildly ambitious, luridly indulgent spectacle of romance, action, melodrama and revisionism, Australia is windy, overblown, utterly preposterous and insanely entertaining". In her review for Salon.com, Stephanie Zacharek wrote, [...] "The second half of Australia, Luhrmann's attempt to pull off a wartime weeper, is so aggressively sentimental that it begins to feel more like punishment than pleasure. I left Australia feeling drained and weakened, as if I'd suffered a gradual poisoning at the hands of a mad scientist".|$|E
