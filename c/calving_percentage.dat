50|$|The country's {{breeding}} stock was primarily Spanish criollo, although {{over the years}} considerable crossbreeding with English breeds and zebu cattle from Brazil had taken place. Although cattle were numerous in Paraguay, the country lacked {{a sufficient number of}} pure-bred breeding cattle. The livestock sector also suffered from a low <b>calving</b> <b>percentage,</b> a high mortality rate, and a long fattening period for steers. Artificial insemination was increasingly common. To a certain extent, cattle raising reflected the disparities in agriculture in general. There were numerous farmers who owned only a few head of relatively unproductive cattle that were slaughtered for the local market under relatively poor sanitary conditions. By contrast, extremely large cattle ranches typically were owned by expatriates and butchered more productive animals for both national and international markets.|$|E

40|$|The {{communal}} grazing {{system is}} generally understood {{to have a}} low input, low output type of management. However, the actual inputs and outputs of the farmers are not well known and the farmers are often unaware of their problems. Although the causes of low <b>calving</b> <b>percentage</b> are well understood in commercial beef farming enterprises in South Africa, the same is not true for communal farming systems. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the reproductive performance of beef cattle on a communal farming system in Jericho, NorthWest Province. Ten farmers from five villages with a total of 265 cows and 13 bulls were purposively selected. The selection criteria were that each farmer had to have a minimum of 10 breeding cows and a bull and be willing to participate in the study. This was followed by a 12 -month longitudinal study with monthly herd visits where cows were examined rectally and bulls (n = 13) were subjected to a single breeding soundness evaluation. The <b>calving</b> <b>percentage</b> was found to be 37. 7 %. This is lower than the recorded percentages for commercial beef cattle on extensive grazing. The factors playing a role in low <b>calving</b> <b>percentage</b> were ranked using field data. From this it appeared that failure of cows to become pregnant was the main cause of poor <b>calving</b> <b>percentage</b> as opposed of loss of calves through abortion or resorption. Sub-fertility of the bulls was found to be of great significance and it is proposed that this be included in extension messages and that bulls be fertility tested routinely.

40|$|Calving records {{collected}} between 2000 and 2008 at the Gudmundsen Sandhills Laboratory, Whitman, NE, {{were used}} to determine the effect of estrous synchronization on calving distribution and the impact of time of calving on carcass characteristics. Calves born between 2000 and 2006 resulted from non-synchronized 60 d breeding seasons between 1999 and 2005 (n = 2075). Calves born in 2007 and 2008 resulted from synchronized 45 d breeding seasons in 2006 and 2007 (n = 521). Estrus was synchronized with a single injection of prostaglandin F 2 α administered 108 h after bulls were turned in with cows. Cow pregnancy rate after synchronized or nonsynchronized breeding seasons was similar (P = 0. 48). Twelve percent more (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) synchronized cows calved during the first 21 d compared to non-synchronized cows. Average <b>calving</b> date and <b>percentage</b> of male <b>calves</b> were similar (P ≥ 0. 23).

40|$|The {{complicated}} {{nature of}} beef cattle farming necessitated {{the development of}} an effective computerised cattle management system (cattle farm planning system). This system was developed and programmed to be a planning and optimising model for maximum profit for the farmer. Farming systems in South Africa differ markedly, and the emerging farmers as well as small-farming communities depend either entirely or partly on agricultural activities for their survival and income generation. The design was mainly focussed on the new group of emerging farmers as well as small-farming communities. Improving the productivity of agriculture has exercised the ingenuity of politicians, planners, researchers, and extension or development agency staff over the last 30 to 40 years (Norman, 1993). For this study the focus was mainly on medium framed cattle (utilised mainly by the emerging farmers). A mathematical model was developed with the use of data from previous researchers, on growth, fertility, mating and <b>calving</b> <b>percentages</b> and data on the dressing percentages, average producer prices as well as other expenses. Growth curves for animals with three different condition score’s was used in conjunction with the expected meat prices and dressing percentages to calculate expected market prices on the hoof. Sales and marketing costs could be viewed on screen in order to show the farmer his profit margin. Using the information in the tables the system also determined the running costs for all cattle on the specific farm. The output of the program worked as follow. First, the marketing strategy was displayed. For each season the number of cattle recommended for sale was graphically displayed, together with the corresponding gross and net income. The user could also select the marketing strategy for a cattle group for the coming two years in each of eight seasons. The herd composition can also be displayed with financial information. The system was developed in order to give the farmer valuable information to help with the management of the farm. Dissertation (MSc(Agric)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2009.

BormannIt is {{important}} for animals to be feed efficient and reproductively sound to optimize profits for cow- calf producers. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the relationship between feed efficiency and reproductive performance. Feed efficiency measures included residual feed intake (RFI), feed to gain ratio (F:G) and daily dry matter intake (DMI). Reproductive measurements were pregnancy rate, first service conception rate, pregnancy type (AI, natural. open), <b>calving</b> <b>percentage,</b> calving day (CD) and age at first calving. Two data sets which included 136 crossbred Angus females sired by bulls with high or low RFI estimated breeding values (EBV) with multiple parity information and 56 purebred Hereford heifers with their first parity calving information were analyzed. Initially, the crossbred Angus females were analyzed based on their phenotypic RFI values. There was no difference in pregnancy rate between the feed efficiency measures. Second parity pregnant females had lower (F:G) with first service conception (P= 0. 053), and pregnancy types (P= 0. 014) than the open (less efficient) females. In parity 5, phenotypically efficient RFI Angus females were pregnant to first service conception versus inefficient RFI Angus females (P= 0. 052) and those with lower DMI were diagnosed pregnant (P= 0. 0002). When evaluated as a repeated trait, RFI was not a significant indicator of CD (P= 0. 514). Crossbred Angus females were analyzed based on their sire’s RFI EBV and grouped accordingly into high (inefficient) or low (efficient) RFI sires. Females sired by high or low RFI (EBV) bulls showed no difference for the reproductive traits, except for a tendency for inefficient sired heifers to have a lower <b>calving</b> <b>percentage</b> in parity 2 (P= 0. 048).

40|$|A low {{calving rate}} (ranging from 20 % to 40 %) was {{recorded}} by state veterinary officials in 10 {{villages in the}} Moretele Local Municipal District in 2011. A previous study {{in the same area}} conducted in 2003 suggested that the probable cause of the low calving rate was bull infertility. However, only 13 bulls were examined in that study. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the fertility of a larger sample of communal bulls (n= 50) to assess their fertility and the perceptions of farmers about bull fertility. A participatory planning workshop was held to inform farmers from Moretele Municipal District about the project and 77 farmers agreed to participate in this study. The criteria for assessing bull fertility included testing for infectious diseases (brucella abortus, campylobacter fetus and trichomonas fetus), measuring scrotal circumference as well as scrotal and preputial tick damage. The electro-ejaculator method was used to collect semen from bulls throughout the study and the Computer Assisted Sperm Analysis system was used to measure total, progressive and non-progressive motility. Slides stained with eosin and nigrosin were examined microscopically for semen morphology. In herds studied, the number of cows and number of calves born over the study period (12 months) were recorded during farm visits, to calculate <b>calving</b> <b>percentage.</b> Data on farmer demographics and opinions were obtained using structured interviews. Two bulls tested positive for brucellosis and ten others were excluded from the project due to various reasons. One was suspicious for T fetus. The average <b>calving</b> <b>percentage</b> of herds studied was 35. 86 %. The overall percentage motility of bull semen was 78. 73 ± 25. 34 %, but percentage progressive motility was very low, with an average of 27. 39 ± 15. 81 %. Percentage non-progressive motility was higher at 51. 34 ± 19. 92 %. Only 50. 62 ± 35. 80 % of the spermatozoa were morphologically normal. Tick damage to the scrotum and prepuce was observed in 92 % of the bulls tested. Scrotal circumference showed an overall mean of 37. 63 ± 3. 42 cm and the overall mean age of the same bulls observed was 3. 88 ± 0. 99 years. About 13 % of the bulls did not reach the minimum scrotal circumference threshold of 34 cm which is recommended at that specific age. Demographic data indicated that farmers were mostly interested in physical conformation of the bulls (n = 9) 18. 4 % and their reproductive performance (n = 15, 30. 6 %). When purchasing a bull, no farmers asked for breeding soundness evaluation or proof that the bull was negative for B. abortus, T. fetus or C. fetus. It was concluded that most of the bulls (92 %) were infertile based on results showing that semen was of poor quality and lack of structural soundness, possibly due to tick damage. It is recommended that extension campaigns be aimed at disseminating information about pre-purchase examination of bulls, disease status and spot treatment of genital areas with an appropriate acaracides, to prevent tick damage to the scrotum and prepuce.

40|$|Page(s) : 9 (1), 163 - 167, 7 Ref. Dairy {{records were}} {{collected}} from Elneshasheba Dairy Farm at Wad Medani, Sudan, to study the reproductive performance of crossbred dairy cows in the area. Age at first calving was the least for 62. 5 % exotic blood, and was {{significantly different from the}} two groups (50 % and 75 %) which were not significantly different from each other. The number of services/conception and gestation length were not significantly affected by the percentage of exotic blood or <b>calving</b> number. The <b>percentage</b> of exotic blood and calving number significnalty affected calving intervals. The birth weight of calves was significantly affected by calving number but not by the percentage of exotic blood. Khartoum University Pres...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-eight Hereford x Angus cows were {{utilized}} {{to determine the}} effects of dietary energy level before and after calving on reproductive function and production in suckled beef cows. Low levels of dietary energy before calving resulted in losses of body composition prior to calving, reduced calf birth weight, lengthened intervals from calving to ovulation, and decreased milk production and calf weight at 70 d of age (P<. 05). Low levels of dietary energy after calving decreased measures of body composition after <b>calving,</b> reduced the <b>percentage</b> of cows that ovulated following calving, and decreased cow milk production and calf weight at 70 d of age (P<. 05). We conclude that dietary energy before and after calving impacts the reproductive function and production of suckled beef cows...|$|R
40|$|Pathogens causing bovine {{respiratory}} disease (BRD) were investigated during the first 12 weeks of the fattening period at 10 veal farms. Broncho-alveolar lavage samples were taken from 20 calves at arrival, 84 days after arrival and before an antibiotic therapy was used {{in case of an}} outbreak of BRD. All samples were tested for viruses: BHV 1, PI 3, BRSV, BVDV and BCV, and bacteria: M. haemolytica, P. multocida, H. somni, A. pyogenes. At arrival at the farm, 15, 7 % of the calves had bacteria in their lungs and 26, 7 % had viruses in their lungs. This percentage increased during outbreaks of BRD. The <b>percentage</b> <b>calves</b> with bacteria in their lungs increased to 60, 5 % at 12 weeks. P. multocida, PI 3 and BCV were most commonly found {{during the course of the}} study...|$|R
