5|$|The {{killing of}} another person must be unlawful. Some defences are {{therefore}} open to the defendant, among them self-defence. Carrying a lawful activity, for example, a fully qualified doctor carrying out an abortion in the required circumstances, could not result in an unlawful homicide even if the <b>child</b> <b>was</b> <b>born</b> alive. Consent might be relevant to some forms of homicide, but not to murder.|$|E

In 1901, not long after they arrived, the Coghlans' first <b>child</b> <b>was</b> <b>born,</b> but the baby lived only three days.

5|$|In Melbourne, Blamey met Minnie Millard, the {{daughter}} of a Toorak stockbroker who was involved in the Methodist Church there. They were married at her home on 8 September 1909.

5|$|After her coronation, Anne {{settled into}} a quiet routine at the King's {{favourite}} residence, Greenwich Palace, {{to prepare for the}} birth of her baby. The <b>child</b> <b>was</b> <b>born</b> slightly prematurely on 7 September 1533. Between three and four in the afternoon, Anne gave birth to a girl, who was christened Elizabeth, probably in honour of either or both Anne's mother Elizabeth Howard and Henry's mother, Elizabeth of York. But the birth of a girl was a heavy blow to her parents, since they had confidently expected a boy. All but one of the royal physicians and astrologers had predicted a son for them and the French king had already been asked to stand as his godfather. Now the prepared letters announcing the birth of a prince had an s hastily added to them to read princes and the traditional jousting tournament for the birth of an heir was cancelled.|$|E

During a training exercise with a cadet, a trainee pilot caused a flap to break off the plane, sending it spinning out of control.

Two of Parry's three sons died after the family moved to Penarth. Parry's youngest son, William, died in 1892; his oldest son, Joseph Haydn, died two years later. While all of Parry's children are said to have had musical talent, his eldest, Joseph Haydn, followed in his father's footsteps as a composer and teacher.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, another Hull House ghost story began circulating. According to this legend, after a man {{claimed that}} he would rather have the Devil in his house than a picture of The Virgin Mary, his <b>child</b> <b>was</b> <b>born</b> with pointed ears, horns, scale-covered skin, and a tail. The mother {{was said to have}} taken the baby to Hull House, where Addams was said to have {{attempted}} to have it baptized and wound up locking it in the attic. While initially annoyed about the story, which had no basis in fact, Addams became fascinated by the effect the episode had on old women in the neighborhood and used the episode as a basis for her book, The Long Road of Woman's Memory.|$|E

5|$|She {{had a short}} {{marriage}} {{characterized by}} abuse and control. A <b>child</b> <b>was</b> <b>born</b> to the couple, but died 11 months later. Before the child's birth, Paine had left her husband and obtained a divorce. To support herself, she taught school for a period {{and then began to}} work as a portraitist. She traveled throughout Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Maine accepting commissions for portraits of individuals or families from 1826 through 1862. Because she lived a mobile lifestyle, she had few long-lasting relationships. The closest personal relationship of her life was with her mother. She raised a girl, however, for three years and taught her how to paint. Once she became a professional portraitist she had periods of financial security, but that and her physical health vacillated over the course of her career.|$|E
5|$|The rituals {{performed}} at the statue by pregnant women involved walking round three times, reciting charms and touching one's abdomen. Women would also carry a band which would either be touched to the statue and then tied around their waist, or half of the band would be tied to the statue while the remaining half would be kept on the woman's body until the <b>child</b> <b>was</b> <b>born.</b> After the childbirth, the basin {{in front of the}} statue was used by women to bathe in. The rites performed in the honour of the statue were said to be similar to those performed by Phoenicians in the worship of their Venus.|$|E
5|$|The {{same day}} his second <b>child</b> <b>was</b> <b>born,</b> Tegström scored a goal in his debut for Fredrikstad, a 2–0 victory against Stabæk on 3 September 2007. He scored against Strømsgodset in October 2007. The {{following}} season, Tegström played {{as a substitute}} and scored one goal in the 2–0 victory against Bodø/Glimt, with Fredrikstad leading the 2008 Tippeligaen after four matches. Tegström did not play much for Fredrikstad in the 2008 season because Tarik Elyounoussi and Garðar Jóhannsson were the preferred strikers in the starting lineup. Tegström secured the club's first silver medals since 1972 when he scored two goals against Molde on 26 October 2008; he came on as a substitute in the 63rd minute of the match, which Fredrikstad won 2–1.|$|E
