5|$|Rubidium is {{approximately}} as abundant as zinc and more abundant than copper. It occurs naturally in the minerals leucite, pollucite, <b>carnallite,</b> zinnwaldite, and lepidolite, {{although none of}} these contain only rubidium and no other alkali metals. Caesium is more abundant than some commonly known elements, such as antimony, cadmium, tin, and tungsten, but is much less abundant than rubidium.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium is the twenty-third most {{abundant}} {{element in the}} Earth's crust, roughly as abundant as zinc and rather more common than copper. It occurs naturally in the minerals leucite, pollucite, <b>carnallite,</b> and zinnwaldite, which contain as much as 1% rubidium oxide. Lepidolite contains between 0.3% and 3.5% rubidium, and is the commercial source of the element. Some potassium minerals and potassium chlorides also contain the element in commercially significant quantities.|$|E
25|$|To {{secure a}} supply of rock salt the factory founders Vorster and Grüneberg {{acquired}} an salt mine in Staßfurt near Magdeburg. The area was known for its deposits of a double salt, a compound of potassium chloride and magnesium chloride named <b>carnallite</b> after its discoverer, the Prussian mining engineer Rudolf von Carnall. The new salt mine Vorster & Grüneberg was rich in deposits of <b>carnallite.</b> Grüneberg developed a new chemical process to produce potassium chloride from <b>carnallite.</b> Initially the <b>carnallite</b> was transported from Staßfurt to Kalk where it was dissolved in a current of stream and after cooling down the <b>carnallite</b> crystallized to obtain potassium chloride. To reduce transport costs the two founders decided to build two potassium chloride factories in Staßfurt and Leopoldshall where they had acquired a second salt mine.|$|E
40|$|The {{combined}} {{consideration of}} the Br, Rb and Li distribution is a suited means for {{the interpretation of the}} genesis of marine evaporites and saline solutions. The Br distribution is important for modelling the primary formation of evaporites {{as well as for the}} understanding of metamorphoses of the evaporite rock. The Br-Rb correlation of the crystallisates is the most important criterium for evaluating the genesis of secondary <b>carnallites.</b> From the Li concentration in saline solutions, especially in fluid inclusions, it is possible to distinguish between solutions remaining from the sea water evaporation and saline solutions of the other origin.

40|$|A {{series of}} Miocene/Pliocene halite {{deposits}} (with extremely low organic carbon contents) from the Sdom Formation (Dead Sea Basin, Israel) have been studied. Distributions and contents of biomarkers have been determined using GC MS and irm-GCMS analyses, respectively. The hydrocarbon fractions consist mainly of pristane, phytane and C 21 to C 25 regular isoprenoids. The predominance of C 21 + regular isoprenoids in the Dead Sea halites and other hypersaline deposits indicate that these components could {{be derived from}} ether-bound membrane lipids of halophilic archaea. The lack of intact ether-bound lipids in the polar fractions indirectly infers that such components have already been released at early stages of diagenesis. Their contents are enriched in, by up to 7, compared to the biomarkers of presumed phytoplanktonic origin (i. e. steranes and hopanes) within the same sediment sample, in agreement with a source other than algae and cyanobacteria, thus, tentatively assigned as halophilic archaea. Based on biomarker distributions, contents and mineral compositions, these sediments {{appear to have been}} deposited in a salinity stratified water body with a bottom water brine. Continual evaporation and deposition of the higher salts (i. e. <b>carnallites)</b> are favourable conditions for the growth of halophilic archaeal communities...|$|R
25|$|Potassium {{chloride}} {{is extracted}} from minerals sylvite, <b>carnallite,</b> and potash. It is also extracted from salt water {{and can be}} manufactured by crystallization from solution, flotation or electrostatic separation from suitable minerals. It is a by-product of the production of nitric acid from potassium nitrate and hydrochloric acid.|$|E
25|$|Caesium {{chloride}} occurs naturally as an impurity in the halide minerals <b>carnallite</b> (KMgCl3·6H2O {{with up to}} 0.002% CsCl), sylvite (KCl) and kainite (MgSO4·KCl·3H2O), and in mineral waters.

25|$|Both companies, Dead Sea Works Ltd. and Arab Potash, use {{extensive}} salt evaporation pans {{that have}} essentially diked the entire {{southern end of}} the Dead Sea for the purpose of producing <b>carnallite,</b> potassium magnesium chloride, which is then processed further to produce potassium chloride. The ponds are separated by a central dike that runs roughly north-south along the international border. The power plant on the Israeli side allows production of magnesium metal (by a subsidiary, Dead Sea Magnesium Ltd.).|$|E
25|$|Caesium {{chloride}} or cesium chloride is the {{inorganic compound}} with the formula CsCl. This colorless solid {{is an important}} source of caesium ions in a variety of niche applications. Its crystal structure forms a major structural type where each caesium ion is coordinated by 8 chlorine ions. Caesium chloride dissolves in water. Caesium chloride occurs naturally as impurities in <b>carnallite</b> (up to 0.002%), sylvite and kainite. Less than 20 tonnes of CsCl is produced annually worldwide, mostly from a caesium-bearing mineral pollucite.|$|E
500|$|Elemental {{potassium}} {{does not}} occur in nature because of its high reactivity. It reacts violently with water (see section Precautions below) and also reacts with oxygen. Orthoclase (potassium feldspar) is a common rock-forming mineral. Granite for example contains 5% potassium, which is well above the average in the Earth's crust. Sylvite (KCl), <b>carnallite</b> , kainite [...] and langbeinite [...] are the minerals found in large evaporite deposits worldwide. The deposits often show layers starting with the least soluble {{at the bottom and}} the most soluble on top. Deposits of niter (potassium nitrate) are formed by decomposition of organic material in contact with atmosphere, mostly in caves; because of the good water solubility of niter the formation of larger deposits requires special environmental conditions.|$|E
500|$|Potassium salts such as <b>carnallite,</b> langbeinite, polyhalite, and sylvite form {{extensive}} evaporite {{deposits in}} ancient lake bottoms and seabeds, making extraction of potassium salts in these environments commercially viable. The principal source of potassium – potash – is mined in Canada, Russia, Belarus, Germany, Israel, United States, Jordan, {{and other places}} around the world. The first mined deposits were located near Staßfurt, Germany, but the deposits span from Great Britain over Germany into Poland. They {{are located in the}} Zechstein and were deposited in the Middle to Late Permian. The largest deposits ever found lie [...] {{below the surface of the}} Canadian province of Saskatchewan. The deposits are located in the Elk Point Group produced in the Middle Devonian. Saskatchewan, where several large mines have operated since the 1960s pioneered the technique of freezing of wet sands (the Blairmore formation) to drive mine shafts through them. The main potash mining company in Saskatchewan is the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan. The water of the Dead Sea is used by Israel and Jordan as a source of potash, while the concentration in normal oceans is too low for commercial production at current prices.|$|E
5000|$|Carnallite’s {{refractive}} index ranges from 1.467 to 1.494. <b>Carnallite</b> may be red {{as a result}} of hematite (Fe2O3) inclusions. The fragmented shards of iron oxide produce red tints in the thin laminae of hematite. <b>Carnallite</b> is also deliquescent in high humidity. This implies that it is also extremely soluble in water. Individual crystals are pseudo-hexagonal and tabular but are extremely rarely seen. [...] Field indicators of <b>carnallite</b> are environment of formation, absence of cleavage, and fracture. Other indicators can be density, taste, associations to local minerals, and whether it is capable of luminescence. <b>Carnallite</b> has a bitter taste. [...] <b>Carnallite</b> may not only be fluorescent but is capable of being phosphorescent. The potassium that <b>carnallite</b> contains fuses easily within a flame, creating a violet color.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carnallite</b> {{is found}} in saline marine deposits. <b>Carnallite</b> {{minerals}} are mineral sediments known as evaporites. Evaporites are concentrated by evaporation of seawater. The inflow of water must be below the evaporation or use levels. This creates a prolonged evaporation period. In controlled environment experiments, the halides form when 10%-20% of the original sample of water remains. Closer to 10 percent sylvite followed by <b>Carnallite</b> form.|$|E

50|$|<b>Carnallite</b> {{occurs with}} a {{sequence}} of potassium and magnesium evaporite minerals: sylvite, kainite, picromerite, polyhalite, and kieserite. <b>Carnallite</b> is an uncommon double chloride mineral that only forms under specific environmental conditions in an evaporating sea or sedimentary basin. It is mined for both potassium and magnesium and occurs in the evaporite deposits of Carlsbad, New Mexico; the Paradox Basin in Colorado and Utah; Stassfurt, Germany; the Perm Basin, Russia; and the Williston Basin in Saskatchewan, Canada. These deposits date from the Devonian through the Permian Periods. In contrast, both Israel and Jordan produce potash from the Dead Sea by using evaporation pans to further concentrate the brine until <b>carnallite</b> precipitates, dredging the <b>carnallite</b> from the pans, and processing to remove the magnesium chloride from the potassium chloride.|$|E
50|$|Bischofite {{deposits}} {{differ by}} their composition: {{some of them}} are salt basins where bischofite is mixed with other minerals such as <b>carnallite,</b> halite, kieserite and anhydrite. These are the so-called bischofite containing rocks which have pink-brown-yellow and orange-red colors. They contain 36-58% of bischofite. <b>Carnallite</b> deposits are known in Staßfurt, Germany - where bischofite was first discovered, and <b>carnallite</b> {{is one of the most}} important minerals in potassium salt deposits (Solykam deposit, Ural, Russia). Sub-surface bischofite layers were also discovered in Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, China and the US.|$|E
5000|$|Carnallite’s {{chemical}} formula is KMgCl3·6(H2O).

5000|$|<b>Carnallite</b> {{is mostly}} used in fertilizers. It is an {{important}} source of potash. [...] Only sylvite outranks carnallite’s importance in potash production. [...] Both are uncommon because they are some of the last evaporites to form. [...] Soluble potassium salts are the main sources for fertilizer. This is because the potassium is difficult to separate from insoluble potassium feldspar. <b>Carnallite</b> is a minor source of magnesium worldwide; however, it is Russia’s main source.|$|E

5000|$|Face sharing {{creates more}} chance of instability, {{according}} to the third of Pauling's rules. [...] In <b>carnallite,</b> the water molecules enclose the magnesium ions. This prevents the magnesium and the chloride from interacting directly; instead, the water molecules act as charge transmitters. The five chloride anions are each coordinated to two potassium cations as well as four water molecules. [...] This means that each chloride anion receives 1/6 of a +1 charge {{from each of the}} two potassium ions. The chloride also obtains 1/6 of a +1 charge from each the four water molecules. The charges thus total six 1/6 positive charges, which balance the negative charge of the chloride. These two aspects render the rare face sharing described of the second and third of Pauling’s rule acceptable in the <b>carnallite</b> structure.|$|E
50|$|Boracite is {{typically}} found in evaporite sequences associated with gypsum, anhydrite, halite, sylvite, <b>carnallite,</b> kainite and hilgardite.
