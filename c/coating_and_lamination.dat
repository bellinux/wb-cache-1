40|$|Electrostatic corona {{pretreatment}} {{has traditionally}} been a very cost-efficient treatment method to optimize adhesion levels during the extrusion <b>coating</b> <b>and</b> <b>lamination</b> process. While it is cost-effective, the residence times may be insufficient to permit penetration of the active species that effect change into the surfaces of web materials. Low-pressure plasmas {{have been used for}} many years to surface treat three-dimensional plastic objects and polymer films, therefore, the benefits of plasma treatment are well recognized: reduced degradation of surface morphology, higher treatment (dyne) levels, elimination of backside treatment, and extended life of treatment over time. However, the complexity, slow speed and high cost of these contained plasma systems make them impractical for all but the most esoteric applications. Now a system has been developed that allows plasmas to be sustained at atmospheric pressure in a way that permits the surface treatment of substrates to enhance adhesion strength and hot tack in the extrusion <b>coating</b> <b>and</b> <b>lamination</b> processes on a continuous web handling system similar to a corona treating system. The Atmospheric Plasma Treatment (APT) process allows treatment in a broad range of reactive chemistries and has been successfully tested on various films, foils, nonwovens and metals. Further, depending upon the dyne level required and type of material, line speeds in excess of 400 fpm are practical and beyond 1, 000 fpm have been achieved. Specialty applications requiring stringent surface morphology specifications, specific surface modification such as hydrophilicity, precise surface coating or tightly controlled electrical characteristics will find the APT system especially attractive and useful...|$|E

Current manu-facturing techniques are being studied and specific approaches are selected that offer advantages for protective outerwear for military applications. A materials evaluation program was initiated by the Army Survivability Directorate in late 1985 to identify potential, alternative commercial wa-terproof and moisture vapor permeable materials capable of meeting mili-tary needs for the Extended Cold Weather Clothing System. After a market survey identified many new semipermeable laminated materials, screen tests for fabric weight, strength, and hydrostatic resistance were used to select the best performing candidates for military fabric construction. Three types of materials were selected for continuing evaluation: a lami-nated PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) microporous membrane, a mono-lithic polyester hydrophilic membrane, and a combination microporous polyolefin/hydrophilic polyurethane membrane layered system.

40|$|The {{packaging}} industry replaces {{more and}} more heavy packaging materials by lighter materials, especially flexible packaging systems. The total packaging surface of flexible films possessing a high barrier against the permeation of gases, moisture and flavor covers about 16 % of all used packagings. The demanded for high barrier properties by lower material consumption {{can be achieved by}} using additional barrier layers, as vacuum evaporated Al, AlOx and SiOx layers. The production chain of high barrier laminates is film production, vacuum web <b>coating</b> <b>and</b> <b>lamination.</b> Along this process chain each single step must be optimized itself and be adapted to the whole chain. Here, each step was analyzed on laboratory as well as industrial scale, whereas the following components were used: substrate films: polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP); barrier layers: Al, AlOx and SiOx; adhesives: polyurethane and ORMOCER; lamination films: biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) and polyethylene films (PE). As final process step, the lamination process is the key issue for the barrier of the total laminate against oxygen, moisture and flavor, because on the one hand it can destroy the functionality of the vacuum evaporated barrier layer {{and on the other hand}} it can improve the barrier by an order of magnitude due to the synergetic effect between the barrier layer and the adhesive...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Chromogenic {{materials}} {{are able to}} change their optical properties in response to external stimuli such as temperature (in thermochromic materials) and electrical charge insertion (in electrochromic materials). Below we review some recent advances for these types of materials. Specifically we first discuss the limitations of thermochromic VO 2 films for energy efficient fenestration and show from calculations that nanocomposites containing VO 2 can have superior properties and display high luminous transmittance and large temperature-dependent solar transmittance modulation. Even better results may be found for nanoparticles of VO 2 :Mg. In {{the second part of}} the paper we survey some recent progress for electrochromic devices and show that W oxide films have increased coloration efficiency when some Ni oxide is added. We also present initial results for flexible electrochromic foils produced by roll-to-roll <b>coating</b> <b>and</b> continuous <b>lamination...</b>|$|R

40|$|The food {{packaging}} industry demands cheap polymer films possessing a high barrier agains permeation of gases, moisture and flavor. Candidates {{for the most}} successful materials fulfilling these requirements are newly developed laminates of biaxial oriented polypropylene (BOPP) films containing a thin inorganic barrier layer and possessing an oxygen permeability lower than 3 cm 3 /(m 2 /dbar) and a moisture permeability lower than 0. 05 g/m 2 day). The thin barrier layers are produced by vacuum web coating of BOPP films. In order to achieve high barrier laminates, one key issue along the whole production chain - from film extrusion to lamination - is given by the surface properties of the non-coated films. Non-coated BOPP film surfaces were modified by different kinds of plasma pretreatment and characterized before the vacuum coating process. The functionality - as adhesion and permeation - of coated barrier films and final high barrier laminates was studied {{as a function of}} pretreatment parameters. The BOPP homopolymer or copolymer films were either pretreated subsequent to the film production by a standard corona atmosphere plasma or in situ before the vacuum web coating by an oxygen low-pressure plasma. The topography of non-treated and pretreated films was analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and the chemical surface properties by contact angle measurement as well as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). These BOPP films were vacuum web coated with aluminium (Al), aluminium oxide (AlOx) or silicon oxide (SiOx) and laminated with a two-component adhesive system. Typical pretreatment parameters of BOPP films necessary for high barrier laminates after <b>coating</b> <b>and</b> <b>lamination</b> could be identified...|$|E
40|$|By {{laminating}} vacuum web coated {{biaxially oriented}} polypropylene (BOPP) films against BOPP films, high barrier laminates {{can be achieved}} possessing an oxygen permentation lower than 2 cmü/m² d bar and a moisture permeation down to 0, 01 g/m² d. The key issues along the whole production process to achieve results like these are: The surface properties of the non-coated films, materials and techniques of the coating, {{as well as the}} lamination step. In our investigation the influence of the surface properties of the non-coated BOPP films on the functionality - as adhesion and permeation - of coated barrier films and the final high barrier laminates was studied on the one hand by varying the surface of the BOPP basic films {{and on the other hand}} by various pretreatments of the different polymer film surfaces. The BOPP homopolymer or copolymer films were either pretreated at the film production by a standard Corona atmosphere plasma or in-situ before the vacuum web coating by an oxygen low pr essure plasma. The topography of the nontreated and pretreated films was analyzed by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and the chemical properties by contact angle measurements as well as X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). These BOPP films were vacuum web coated with aluminium (AI) or silicon oxide (SiOx) and laminated with a two component system, on lab as well as on industrial scale. Finally, metallized as well as transparent laminates with different surface properties before the coating and laminating were mechanically stressed and the changes in permeation are measured. Hence, typical surface properties of the non-coated films being necessary to get high barrier laminates after <b>coating</b> <b>and</b> <b>lamination</b> could be identified...|$|E
40|$|Electrically {{conducting}} polymers {{were discovered}} in the late 1970 s. This finding generated a whole new research area named organic electronics, an area which has attracted great interest and tremendous achievements, in terms of devices and applications, have been reached by different research groups all over the world. Replacing inorganic materials by their organic counterparts in various kinds of electronic devices provides novel device functionalities {{as well as new}} opportunities in device manufacturing. One of the major advantages of utilizing organic materials in electronic devices is the high degree of freedom regarding fabrication methods. Since organic materials can be processed from solution various printing, <b>coating</b> <b>and</b> <b>lamination</b> techniques can be used to manufacture entire electronic systems on flexible carriers and substrates in a truly reel-to-reel fashion. The main theme of this thesis relates to exploring novel device architectures to enable easy manufacturing of flexible electrochromic displays based on organic materials. After the introduction, {{the second part of the}} thesis treats some of the fundamentals of conducting polymers, and the third part explains the building blocks of matrix-addressed electrochromic displays: those systems combine electrochemical transistors and electrochromic display pixels. A brief introduction to printed electronics is also given in the fourth section. Then, active matrix addressed displays utilizing electronic vias manufactured through the substrate, which enable to use the substrate more efficiently in the resulting three-dimensional architecture, are presented in the fifth section. This novel system arrangement results in a matrix-addressed display with a relatively high fill-factor since its subcomponents are located on opposite sides of the substrate. The sixth section of the thesis is related to the achievement of passive matrix addressed displays. The architecture and the manufacturing process of these electrochromic displays are both very simple: an electrolyte is sandwiched in between the counter and the pixel electrode layers. The electrode materials chosen results in a non-linear current versus voltage characteristics, which enables matrix addressability also without the transistors. At last, in the seventh section, nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) is used as the scaffold for either an electroactive polymer or the electrolyte. Various components, such as electrochromic pixels and electrochemical transistors, can be built from the resulting solid films thanks to the stable, soft and tacky properties of the hybridized NFC layer. Hence, a new concept for integration and reconfiguration of electronic systems consisting of electrochemical devices is achieved...|$|E

40|$|When the {{distributed}} rock stress {{around the}} roadways exceeds {{the strength of}} the rock, the rock is failed and a softening zone is formed. Roof deformation developed in the roof and ribs of the roadways are highly controlled by the depth of softening zones. The rock failure process starts from a point ahead of the face and grows into the roof, floor and ribs by advancing roadway. The maximum stress that can be transferred through the failed rocks would be equal to its residual confined strength. Therefore, rock stress is moved above failed zone and will create new failure zone if it is higher than the confined strength of rock at that depth. This process continues until the confined strength of the rock becomes higher than stress components. Bedding <b>and</b> <b>lamination</b> planes play a big role into the failure pathway of rocks around roadways. The thickness of softening zone is significantly influenced by the shear and tensile strength of bedding planes <b>and</b> <b>laminations.</b> This paper presents a 3 D numerical assessment of the bedding <b>and</b> <b>lamination</b> planes impacts to the forming and extension of the softening zones.
