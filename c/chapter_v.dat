Miguel opened for Alicia Keys on her Set The World On Fire Tour during March and April. Although he did not choreograph his shows, he routinely rehearsed in a dance studio and practiced singing in front of a mirror. In concert, he performed dramatic leaps, staggers, and other moves fashioned after Little Richard and James Brown. He started ripping his shirt off during performances after being inspired by Songz' concerts.|$|E

25|$|Bunin's {{first love}} was Varvara Paschenko, his classmate in Yelets, {{daughter}} of a doctor and an actress, whom he fell for in 1889 {{and then went on}} to work with in Oryol in 1892. Their relationship was difficult in many ways: the girl's father detested the union because of Bunin's impecunious circumstances, Varvara herself was not sure if she wanted to marry and Bunin too was uncertain whether marriage was really appropriate for him. The couple moved to Poltava and settled in Yuly Bunin's home, but by 1892 their relations deteriorated, Pashchenko complaining in a letter to Yuli Bunin that serious quarrels were frequent, and begging for assistance in bringing their union to an end. The affair eventually ended in 1894 with her marrying actor and writer A.N. Bibikov, Ivan Bunin's close friend. Bunin felt betrayed, and for a time his family feared the possibility of his committing suicide. According to some sources it was Varvara Paschenko who many years later would appear under the name of Lika in The Life of Arseniev (<b>chapter</b> <b>V</b> of the book, entitled Lika, was also published as a short story). Scholar Tatyana Alexandrova, though, questioned this identification (suggesting Mirra Lokhvitskaya might have been the major prototype), while Vera Muromtseva thought of Lika as a 'collective' character aggregating the writer's reminiscences of several women he knew in his youth.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimited. The present work {{is an attempt}} to put together the most relevant aspects of the engineering problems involving distributed parameter systems (D. P. S. 's). Simulation and optimal control are explained in detail in Chapters II and III. The original contribution of this thesis is given in <b>Chapters</b> <b>V</b> and VI, where modal control theory and a gradient subroutine that searches for the optimal reference coefficients are used. As a result, it was possible to obtain an output distribution better than the one achievable by the known methods. This technique works in situations of strongly nonlinear control and compensates the effect of having the analyzer and synthesizer approximated by low order matrices. It also makes it possible to give higher weight to some zones of the output distribution {{in order to have a}} better local fit.

500|$|Most of the {{chapters}} address aspects of English food, whether types of food such as meat, eggs, fungi, and bread, or {{ways of dealing}} with food such as salting, drying and preserving. Some chapters such as 'Elizabethan households' are explicitly historical. Every chapter, however, is also a history. For example, <b>chapter</b> <b>V,</b> Meat, discusses [...] "a rather interesting mediaeval miracle" [...] and illustrates a traditional [...] "Colonial Travelling Meat Safe of Mosquito Net". The text switches repeatedly from instructions ("To prepare mutton fat for a mutton piecrust, melt it over a bowl of hot water") to historical asides ("Mutton fat was used in the mountain-sheep districts for the same purposes as suet or goose-grease in the valleys"). Many of the processes are distinctly old-fashioned; thus, Hartley describes basting, dredging, and frothing, switching between the past and present tenses: [...] "Dredging. This was done between bastings. Thus you dredge with powders or spices to give flavour, or with acid juices, or chopped herbs, which the pouring fat washes down into the crevices of the roasting meat." ...|$|E
500|$|In Darwin's {{time there}} was no {{agreed-upon}} model of heredity; in Chapter I Darwin admitted, [...] "The laws governing inheritance are quite unknown." [...] He accepted {{a version of the}} inheritance of acquired characteristics (which after Darwin's death came to be called Lamarckism), and <b>Chapter</b> <b>V</b> discusses what he called the effects of use and disuse; he wrote that he thought [...] "there {{can be little doubt that}} use in our domestic animals strengthens and enlarges certain parts, and disuse diminishes them; and that such modifications are inherited", and that this also applied in nature. Darwin stated that some changes that were commonly attributed to use and disuse, such as the loss of functional wings in some island dwelling insects, might be produced by natural selection. In later editions of Origin, Darwin expanded the role attributed to the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Darwin also admitted ignorance of the source of inheritable variations, but speculated they might be produced by environmental factors. However, one thing was clear: whatever the exact nature and causes of new variations, Darwin knew from observation and experiment that breeders were able to select such variations and produce huge differences in many generations of selection. The observation that selection works in domestic animals is not destroyed by lack of understanding of the underlying hereditary mechanism.|$|E
