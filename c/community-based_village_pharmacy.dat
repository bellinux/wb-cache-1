To study this issue, a community-based cluster survey was conducted duging October 2001 in the catchment area for a passive surveillance study in Zhengding county, a rural area of northern China. Interviews were conducted at 7 randomly-selected households in each of 39 study villages. The respondents indicated where they sought initial care for cases of diarrhoea or dysentery among children or adults. In the absence of diarrhoea and dysentery cases in the household in the preceding four weeks, the respondents were asked about healthcare use for a hypothetical case.

The second half of the 19th century saw due to bad weather conditions crop failure and many inhabitants of the village had to switch to crafts. Weaving, spinning and basketry gained importance and the baskets made in Csernye became well known all over the Transdanubian. In 1920 coal mining begun in the area of Bakonycsernye and a narrow-gauge railway line was constructed in the vicinity for coal transport. Consequently, Bakonycsernye turned into a mining village. Electricity was introduced, a <b>village</b> <b>pharmacy,</b> a doctor's surgery opened at Bakonycsernye and in the Gaja valley several water mills were constructed; another coal mine at Balinka opened in 1950 and many inhabitants of Bakonycsernye took up job opportunities in this mine. Today a cultural centre, a library and a music school serve the educational and cultural needs of the inhabitants. In addition to two kindergartens the village also boasts a school building. The sports hall of the village school covers an area of 800 square metres and it can be used all the year round. During the local elections of 1994 the local government of the Slovak minority was elected. It is their task to cherish the Slovak language and traditions. In order to keep the old cultural traditions alive they built a Slovak Cultural Centre in the village. The ruins of the 15th century Csikling castle can be found approx 4 kilometres from Bakonycsernye. Other important sights in the village include the Lutheran and the Catholic churches, both built in Baroque style. The village also boast several early 19th century porched cottages. Infrastructurally Bakonycsernye can offer favourable conditions. Its houses are equipped with electricity, gas, running water as well as modern telecommunication network systems area also built into the village. The local government inaugurated the settlement's coat of arms and flag in 1997. The inhabitants of the village do a lot in order to create and improve the local conditions for village tourism at Bakonycsernye. The number of houses offering accommodation has lately been on the increase.

However, local knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of parasitic worms are poorly understood, although such information is required for prevention and sustainable control. Methods: We carried out KAP surveys in two rural communities of Côte d’Ivoire that were subjected to school-based and community-based research and control activities. We used qualitative and quantitative methods. The former included observations, in-depth interviews with key informants, and focus group discussions with school children and adults. Quantitative methods consisted of a structured questionnaire administered to household heads. Principal Findings: Access to clean water was lacking in both communities and {{only a quarter of}} the households had functioning latrines. There was a better understanding of soil-transmitted helminthiasis than intestinal schistosomiasis, but community-based rather than school-based interventions appeared to improve knowledge of schistosomiasis.

40|$|Increasing water {{scarcity}} and contamination pose {{a danger to}} the health of a considerable number of the world’s population. Decisions regarding water supply and treatment are usually made in a top-down fashion. The end-users, however, still react to these decisions and the provided water facilities and treatment options. These reactions include the rejection of certain water supplies or treatment options and own provisions for a supply with safe and sufficient drinking water. This study investigates the socio-cultural and economic factors which influence the rural Indian population’s preferences regarding their water supply and treatment. The study has been carried out, employing an ethnographic approach to the field, in two villages in Karnataka, in South India, conducting 18 in depth, problem-centred interviews, participant observation, and two group discussions. The key findings show a ubiquitous lack of education regarding water and related hygiene-measures, water policies and water contamination. This led to uninformed opinions about water supplies and treatment. Socio- cultural factors, along with pragmatic factors such as reliability of water supply and treatment, along with the physical ease of use regarding their operation, were found to be more important for the villagers’ preferences than economic factors. Most households viewed piped water supply as an unreliable source of water, also in terms of water quality. The households and NGO interviewees favoured individual <b>community-based</b> solutions on <b>village</b> level, whereas the political decision-makers were in favour of centralised solutions, usually through piped supply. These findings show a need for long-term, in-depth studies of individual socio-cultural factors and the importance of decentralised and individually fitted water supply and treatment solutions. The fact that perceptions of water supplies and treatment, based on similar concepts could be found in two villages, in entirely differing regions in South India, suggests the significance of these findings beyond Karnataka and the Indian borders...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background A rural {{pharmacy}} initiative (RPI) {{designed to}} increase access to medicines in rural Kyrgyzstan created a network of 12 pharmacies using a revolving drug fund mechanism in 12 <b>villages</b> where no <b>pharmacies</b> previously existed. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine if the establishment of the RPI resulted in the unforeseen benefit of triggering medicine price competition in pre-existing (non-RPI) private pharmacies located in the region. Methods We conducted descriptive and multivariate analyses on medicine insurance claims data from Kyrgyzstan's Mandatory Health Insurance Fund for the Jumgal District of Naryn Province from October 2003 to December 2007. We compared average quarterly medicine prices in competitor pharmacies before and after the introduction of the rural pharmacy initiative in October 2004 to determine the RPI impact on price competition. Results Descriptive analyses suggest competitors reacted to RPI prices for 21 of 30 (70 %) medicines. Competitor medicine prices from the quarter before RPI introduction to the end of the study period decreased for 17 of 30 (57 %) medicines, increased for 4 of 30 (13 %) medicines, and remained unchanged for 9 of 30 (30 %) medicines. Among the 9 competitor medicines with unchanged prices, five initially decreased in price but later reverted back to baseline prices. Multivariate analyses on 19 medicines that met sample size criteria confirm these findings. Fourteen of these 19 (74 %) competitor medicines changed significantly in price from the quarter before RPI introduction to the quarter after RPI introduction, with 9 of 19 (47 %) decreasing in price and 5 of 19 (26 %) increasing in price. Conclusions The RPI served as a market driver, spurring competition in medicine prices in competitor pharmacies, even when they were located in different villages. Initiatives {{designed to increase}} equitable access to medicines in rural regions of developing and transitional countries should consider the potential to leverage medicine price competition as a means of achieving their goal.

Methods: The intervention was implemented by five non-governmental organisations in five districts of Maharashtra, India, and was assessed by external evaluators in April, 2010, 18 months after the start of the project, using a quasiexperimental study design. After a census and listing of married adolescent girls, a cross-sectional, systematic random sample of 759 married adolescent girls was selected from a purposive sample of five intervention sites and 516 married adolescent girls from five randomly selected control sites for preintervention and postintervention surveys. Continuous t test and Chi square test were used to analyse the data. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated at 95 % CI. Findings: Respondents from the intervention and control sites were similar for most key indicators.

40|$|In Spore N 12, Dr Mohammed Yunus, {{described}} how {{the founding of}} the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh had helped to stimulate the very poor to develop self-reliance through group credit and the setting up of small business enterprises. The UN International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) has {{played a major role in}} providing funds for the Grameen Bank and is also involved in providing rural credit in Africa, as Bahman Mansuri, IFAD's Africa Division Director outlines. The Sahelian countries of Africa, like Bangladesh in Asia, have a history of climatic disasters and an inheritance of poverty greater than most parts of the world. If these cou ntries are to survive, let alone develop, the resources of the people must be engaged: sustainable prosperity, like sustainable development, must come from the grass-roots and one of the greatest challenges is how to help the very poor to help themselves. Mali is one of Africa's very poorest nations, often cursed by drought and pest attack. Farmers need extra funds to help them realize their potential to grow more food but loans to people who have no security or collateral to offer are not considered a risk worth taking by most banks. Provision of credit and its recovery in a cost effective manner remains one of the major obstacles for the development of smallholder sector. The Segou region of central Mali, 150 miles north-east of the capital Bamako is typical: agricultural production is constantly threatened and reduced by the short growing season and by poor soil fertility. The land needs preparation at the right time, and this demands the use of draught animals. But the villagers of the Segou, are for the most part, so poor that keeping animals is beyond their reach. Their subsistence farming consists of cultivating a little millet, sorghum, fonio and cowpea, and some vegetables. Only the better-off can afford cattle. Illiteracy is al most total. Since 1985, however, this vicious cycle of need has been broken. A Village Development Fund Project (VDFP) of $ 9. 18 million was set up by IFAD (International Fund for Agricultural Development) as the result of an initiative in 1982, and is already benefiting 85 of the very Door 439 villagges in the Segou. Loans to projects generated in the villages are channelled through the Banque Nationale de Developpement Agricole (BNDA) of Mali, at the recommendation of village credit committees whose members are elected by the villagers and trained by the project. The annual rate of interest is fixed at 10 % and the loan is repaid over a five-year period. The applications from villagers have to be approved by the whole village community, which then becomes responsible for guaranteeing repayment. The community has to put down 10 % of the value of the loan, as does the VDFP, and this serves as security for the loan. The average loan is about $ 350, and is used mainly for buying draught animals so that the land under cultivation is extended. There is scope within the Project for direct short-term credit to provide for seasonal inputs and the marketing of crops. Interest earned on loans from the Village Fund is ploughed back into the fund itself, and 2. 5 % of th e interest earn ed on credit f rom the BNDA is collected by the villagers as rem uneration for assisting the bank in the recovery of its medium-term credit. The project has also successfully launched a functional literacy programme which permits widespread farmer training in primary health, basic hygiene and nutrition, as well as midwife training. In addition, training is organized for paraextension workers who are resident in the village and work directly with farmers in diffusion of technologies while acting as feedback agents for the project'stechnical package. The active involvement of the rural population in its own development is one of the great strengths of the VDF Project. By building on the traditional village organization, it creates village funds to attract village savings and to direct them towards productive investment and community welfare. Loans can also be made to help people diversify from agriculture, and so decrease dependence in times of drought. Schemes which have been approved and funded include setting up <b>village</b> shops, <b>pharmacies,</b> poultry farming and smallstock raising. For the first time in Mali farmers organizations under this project, following a successful competition with private traders, will be supplying 4000 tonnes in 1988 / 89 to the national cereals marketing board (OPAM), which represents one third of the replenishment of Mali's national security stock. Concerns for environmental protection are also reflected in the project implementation. This is done by way of reafforestation and also through utilization at household level, of energy-saving, improved stoves. As many classically patterned projects have fallen short of their objectives, the concept of 'integrated' development has been progressively abandoned. However, a major lesson from the Segou Village Development Fund is that what has failed is not the principle of integration, but the way such integration is often managed, without effective participation of beneficiaries. Further village funds like the one in the Segou district of Mali are at the moment being established by IFAD in Guinea under the Fouta Djallon Agricultural Rehabilitation Project, and are being contemplated in Niger.
