25|$|Work began {{that summer}} with {{the removal of}} the south bank powerhouses. The {{existing}} dam was used as a <b>coffer</b> <b>dam</b> while workers poured concrete for the new dam. The new dam was finished on August 1, 1927, and began generating electricity in September. The new dam's reservoir completely drowned the old dam behind it.|$|E
2500|$|On April 18, 1874, the Onward was {{reported}} to have been transferred from the Tualatin River to the Willamette River. [...] The steamer was also said to have been “transported” from the Tualatin to the Willamette. [...] According to later testimony of James D. Miller, the new owner, he had brought Onward down to the Willamette through the unnavigable rapids {{at the mouth of the}} Tualatin through the use of a <b>coffer</b> <b>dam.</b>|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} the 18th century, it was {{apparent}} that the old London Bridge — by then over 600 years old — needed to be replaced. It was narrow and decrepit, and blocked river traffic. In 1799, a competition for designs to replace the old bridge was held. Entrants included Thomas Telford, whose proposal of a single iron arch spanning [...] was rejected as unfeasible and impractical. John Rennie won the competition with a more conventional design of five stone arches. It was built [...] west (upstream) of the original site by Jolliffe and Banks of Merstham, Surrey, under the supervision of Rennie's son. Work began in 1824 and the foundation stone was laid, in the southern <b>coffer</b> <b>dam,</b> on 15 June 1825.|$|E
30|$|These maps of {{vulnerability}} were integrated to the PCS as appendixes, and {{made available to}} participants for the second exercise in May 2016. Their purpose was, where possible, to inform the first protection measures taken by municipal staff during the crisis (for instance, setting up <b>coffer</b> <b>dams),</b> {{as well as the}} organization of evacuation.|$|R
50|$|Outside {{the field}} of {{electrical}} engineering, McGalliard was issued a patent on February 2, 1978 for nylon hose treated with a micro-encapsulation of hair-dissolving solution designed to remove hair from {{the legs of the}} wearer. In 2006, he developed a trailer delivery system for installing cement boat ramps, involving the laying of connected cement planks directly into the water, thereby not polluting the waters with dissolved cement mortar or having to construct <b>coffer</b> <b>dams.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{lighters}} were 156 ft in length, 14 ft {{depth and}} 30 ft breadth and cost about £18,000 each to build. The hull included 10 oil tanks, separated by air spaces and <b>coffer</b> <b>dams,</b> which held {{a capacity of}} 550 tons of liquid fuel oil. Sleeping accommodation and a saloon were also provided in the forward portion. Two sets of diesel engines with centrigual pumps discharged the fuel oil from the tanks.|$|R
2500|$|Construction {{contracts}} {{were drawn}} up in late February, and excavation {{work on the}} D.C. abutments began in March. The first <b>coffer</b> <b>dam</b> for construction of the piers was sunk in May 1918, and the old Aqueduct Bridge formally closed on July 9. [...] Immense amounts of concrete were needed to construct the bridge. One concrete mixing plant was constructed on the D.C. shore, and concrete was delivered to the worksite in the river by ropeway conveyor. A second mixing plant was constructed in mid-river: The plant was floated into position, and then allowed to sink down to the riverbed. Steel for the reinforced concrete structure and for the steel arches within its spans was assembled on the D.C. shoreline, then floated by barge to the worksite. Progress was slow, as reinforced concrete was a relatively new type of construction. The project ran out of money, and Tyler requested and won an additional $1.1 million from Congress in 1920 to finish the work.|$|E
6000|$|... "You'd {{have to go}} {{into the}} water," [...] Norton agreed. [...] "That would have meant a <b>coffer</b> <b>dam,</b> and the Company won't stand for {{expensive}} extras." ...|$|E
60|$|Thurston was {{standing}} knee-deep in ground-up stone and mire, inside a <b>coffer</b> <b>dam</b> about which the river frothed and roared, {{when a man}} brought him word that Miss Savine waited for him. He hurried to meet her, and presently halted beside her horse--a burly figure in shapeless slouch hat, with a muddy oilskin hanging from his shoulders above the stained overalls and long boots.|$|E
5000|$|The {{designers}} {{worked in}} 3 - 8 cm of armor over the magazines and aviation fuel tanks. The fuel tanks copied British practice {{and consisted of}} cylinders or <b>coffer</b> <b>dams</b> separated from the ship's hull by water-filled compartments. This was a safety measure intended to prevent fracturing of the fuel system and the inadvertent spread of volatile AvGas fumes due to severe vibration or [...] "whip" [...] from bomb hits, near misses and torpedo hits.|$|R
25|$|Timber <b>coffer</b> <b>dams</b> were constructed; {{they were}} 76ft 6in by 29ft with two skins, {{the space between}} being filled with puddle clay. James Nasmyth had a novel design of steam pile driver; it had first been used in Devonport Docks in 1845; it could deliver 60 to 70 blows a minute; the cycle time with the hand {{operated}} pile drivers formerly in use was four minutes. The drop weight was 1½ tons and its stroke was 2ft 9in; one was purchased from Nasmyth.|$|R
50|$|The {{contract}} for {{the first section of}} the Mount Perry railway was awarded to J. & A. Overend and Company in November 1878. Progress on the railway was delayed during 1879 by construction of the bridge over Splitters Creek. The original design required screw pile foundations, but a deep bed of boulders was encountered and cast iron caissons, later filled with concrete and brickwork, had to be sunk instead. Work was further delayed by an unsuccessful attempt by the contractors to use <b>coffer</b> <b>dams</b> to aid the sinking of the piers.|$|R
60|$|Then, too, {{some very}} solid and {{substantial}} barrier {{was required to}} be constructed between the excavated basins made and {{the bank of the}} river, to prevent the water of the river from bursting in upon the workmen while they were digging. In such a case as this they make what is called a <b>coffer</b> <b>dam,</b> which is a sort of dam, or dike, made by driving piles close together into the ground, in two rows, at a little distance apart, and then filling up the space between them with earth and gravel. By this means the water of the river can be kept out until the digging of the basins is completed.|$|E
50|$|When the Oderteich {{is fully}} emptied {{the remains of}} <b>coffer</b> <b>dam</b> can be seen about 200 metres above the main dam. This was built in 1898 when the Oderteich Reservoir was empty {{in order to reduce}} the water flow whilst repairs were carried out to the bottom outlet. The <b>coffer</b> <b>dam</b> must have been {{demolished}} immediately after this repair had been completed.|$|E
50|$|The rapids are {{a result}} of the Saluda River running over the remains of a twice-dynamited <b>coffer</b> <b>dam.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Central R. Co. of N. J. v. Mills, 113 U.S. 249 (1885), {{involved}} {{a case where}} the Court of Claims had dismissed a petition of the claimants, regarding the rejection of two items sued for: (1) labor done and materials furnished by the claimants in constructing the <b>coffer</b> <b>dams,</b> and in performing the work necessarily connected therewith and preliminary to the masonry work for the piers and abutments, (2) loss and damages resulting to the claimants in consequence of the reduction of the dimensions of the piers and abutments made subsequently to the making of the contract.|$|R
5000|$|Designed by James B. Long {{and built}} by Glen Wiley and Glenway Maxon (Wiley-Maxon Construction Company), it cost $2,484,000 (equal to $ today) plus $56,400 (equal to $ today) paid {{as an early}} {{completion}} bonus. Constructed of reinforced concrete, the 5183 ft bridge (6657 ft including spans over land) has 27 river piers, 22 approach piers, a 38 ft two-lane roadway, and a 6 ft sidewalk. [...] of concrete and 8 million pounds of steel reinforcing rods were used, and <b>coffer</b> <b>dams</b> were built to aid in construction. Each span consists of three separate concrete ribs connected at five points by horizontal concrete struts, with the longest span measuring 185 ft.|$|R
5000|$|In the 13th century Redcliffe and Bristol {{underwent}} a rapid expansion, in King Henry III's reign {{due to a}} 'major harbour improvement' (Broad Quay or St. Augustines Reach). This involved {{the construction of a}} 'Great Ditch' which formed a new course for the River Frome through St Augustine's Marsh. This provided more space for ships to moor and new quays were built. In the same period a stone bridge, Bristol Bridge, was constructed. To achieve this, the river Avon was diverted through Redcliffe, along the line of the 'Portwall' and solid stone foundations laid for the bridge, behind wattle and daub <b>coffer</b> <b>dams.</b> [...] "The men of Redcliffe" [...] were enjoined to help these projects by Henry III.|$|R
50|$|A <b>coffer</b> <b>dam</b> was {{constructed}} near the Glacial River Bridge that spans Jökulsárlón {{in order to}} build a row of protective measures of stone boulders to prevent any erosion of the foundation of the pillars of the bridge. This <b>coffer</b> <b>dam</b> enabled the Icelandic road administration to create workable access for the power shovel digger to place the row of stone protective measures, which would also divert the icebergs from hitting the bridge pillars and thus avoid damage to the structure.|$|E
50|$|The {{very next}} rainy season, however, brought further floods {{even worse than}} the {{previous}} year. Nyaminyami had struck again, destroying the <b>coffer</b> <b>dam,</b> the access bridge {{and parts of the}} main wall.|$|E
5000|$|First of all, a large <b>coffer</b> <b>dam</b> was built, {{constructed}} of {{two rows of}} steel plates between which a [...] of sand was tipped. Any water that seeped through was pumped away.|$|E
5000|$|The 1929 {{bridge was}} 850 ft in length, {{consisting}} of eleven 80 ft spans. The construction used [...] {{of dirt and}} [...] of steel. Planning for the span took about five years to hammer out the details between the two states. Setbacks during construction included flooding of the <b>coffer</b> <b>dams</b> used {{in the building of}} the piers that supported the bridge. The bridge opened in December 1929, just months after the October 29 stock market crash. The dedication ceremony for the bridge was held on June 6, 1930 and included governors Walter J. Kohler, Sr. of Wisconsin and Fred W. Green of Michigan. The ribbon cutters included Princess Kenoke of the Menominee Tribe.|$|R
50|$|The {{judgment}} of the Court of Claims is affirmed for the full amount of the award made to the claimants, and an additional amount of,842.82 is allowed for the labor done and materials furnished by the claimants in constructing <b>coffer</b> <b>dams</b> and in performing the work necessarily connected therewith and preliminary to the mason work for the piers and abutments referred to in their contract, the same being an additional allowance on account of item (1) in their petition filed August 30, 1876, and the said judgment is reversed so far as respects item (2) in that petition, and the sum of,574.80 is allowed for that item, and this cause was remanded to the Court of Claims, with a direction to enter judgment accordingly.|$|R
50|$|The Supreme Court {{held that}} the ruling of the Court of Claims in regard to item (1) - the <b>coffer</b> <b>dams</b> - was erroneous, and that by the actual {{contract}} between the parties the claimants were not {{to do any of}} the work covered by the claim made by them under item (1), and that the written contract must be reformed accordingly. As to item (2), this Court held, that the Court of Claims placed too limited a construction upon the special act of Congress, and that its power, under that act, extended to reforming the contract in respect to permitting the officers of the United States to materially vary the plans for the piers so as to essentially change the obligations of the parties.|$|R
5000|$|Outside the citadel, {{above the}} 3 in {{armoured}} deck were {{a large number}} of small watertight compartments used to hold coal and stores. Between them and the hull were 4 ft compartments filled with cork and containing a 2 ft <b>coffer</b> <b>dam.</b> The dam was filled with oakum and canvas which had been shown to help reduce the size of the hole made by a projectile passing through the <b>coffer</b> <b>dam.</b> All of these materials were treated with calcium chloride to try to reduce their flammability. Experiments were carried out with [...] firing 64-pounder shells into full scale replicas of the cork compartments and coffer dams.|$|E
50|$|As of Oct 2013, the Google Maps {{satellite}} view (probably {{a year or}} more old) {{shows the}} construction site, with a small <b>coffer</b> <b>dam</b> a bit upstream of the point where the permanent dam is being built.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{possible}} to bring a steamboat down Sucker Creek from Sucker Creek to the Willamette River, if appropriate measures were taken, including {{the building of a}} <b>coffer</b> <b>dam</b> in the abandoned mill race. [...] James D. Miller did this with the Onward.|$|E
5000|$|In 1904, the Great Falls Power Company {{purchased}} the Great Falls property {{with plans to}} dam the Caney Fork and provide power to the Nashville area. The company built several <b>coffer</b> <b>dams,</b> {{all of which were}} destroyed when the river flooded in 1914. The company, which often struggled with finances, finally began construction on the Great Falls Hydroelectric Plant in 1915, and the dam went into operation in 1917. The Tennessee Electric Power Company (TEPCo) {{purchased the}} Great Falls Power Company in 1922, and tripled the dam's operating capacity. The Good Friday Flood of 1929, in which the Caney Fork reached record volumes, destroyed the dam's substation and flooded its powerhouse, but the dam held. [...] In 1939, the TEPCO Dam was purchased by the Tennessee Valley Authority, which continues to operate it.|$|R
50|$|A 60 ft pit or {{channel in}} the mudflats was dredged {{to a depth}} of 20 ft below low tide level and huge loads of rock were dumped in from scows and barges at the center line of the trench until they stopped sinking, to make an evenly graded ridge the whole way at the height of mean low tide. The rocks became the {{foundation}} for the seawall. <b>Coffer</b> <b>dams</b> were sunk and forms constructed inside them while constant pumping occurred. A mass of concrete 2 ft thick and 10 ft wide was poured over the rocks and a masonry wall seven feet at the base and nine feet high was constructed. The area inside the wall was pumped out and filled with rock, rubble and trash to the city grade. It took the board several years to acquire the leases on private wharves.|$|R
50|$|The {{decision}} of the Court of Claims in regard to item (1) was that the claimants had not shown that the written contract did not express the intent of both parties as to the <b>coffer</b> <b>dams,</b> and that even if that court were satisfied that the claimants executed the contract in mistake of their rights, {{there was no evidence}} that the defendants shared the mistake. Its decision in regard to item (2) was that it would be disposed to regard the case, on the facts, as one for equitable interposition for the purpose of further inquiry and the ascertainment of the rights of the parties in equity if it had jurisdiction, but that the statute did not authorize it to entertain those considerations, because, in the proceedings before it, it could hear and determine only claims for labor done and materials furnished by the claimants under their contract with the defendants.|$|R
50|$|The 5 km long, 55 m high {{earthfill dam}} with {{composite}} masonry cum concrete spillway and undersluice structures, concrete diaphragm cut-off wall, rock excavation in foundation, diversion channel, <b>coffer</b> <b>dam</b> and appurtenant works at Tenughat {{was built for}} supply of water to Bokaro Steel Plant and the Bokaro industrial area.|$|E
50|$|The {{construction}} of 25 Bank Street was undertaken by Canary Wharf Contractors, {{with an overall}} build time of 32 months. The geography of the site presented considerable access challenges {{in that it was}} surrounded by water on three sides, with two thirds of the fourth side in the former dock. A <b>coffer</b> <b>dam</b> was constructed in the dock to enable the water to be pumped out and a road was built on top of the dam, with earth ramps to enable construction traffic to reach the construction site.River traffic was extensively used to minimise road deliveries; consignments of aggregates and structural steel were delivered by barge and a concrete batching plant was constructed on a barge anchored in the dock. At the end of the project the <b>coffer</b> <b>dam</b> was removed and the fill loaded onto barges for removal.|$|E
50|$|Work began {{that summer}} with {{the removal of}} the south bank powerhouses. The {{existing}} dam was used as a <b>coffer</b> <b>dam</b> while workers poured concrete for the new dam. The new dam was finished on August 1, 1927, and began generating electricity in September. The new dam's reservoir completely drowned the old dam behind it.|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge was}} {{designed}} by Parsons, Klapp, Brinckerhoff and Douglass {{and called for a}} 6982 ft bridge with 69 spans with a total cost of $3 million. The bridge was delayed by two months, but was completed for better than $100,000 under budget. A crew of nearly 200 constructed the bridge and the work was completed without a single fatality. This claim however is contested as a fatality took place during the construction of the <b>coffer</b> <b>dams</b> on September 18, 1939. On July 27, 1940, the bridge opened for traffic and a 90 cent toll was charged on the Kingstown side. The toll would later be reduced to 35 cents and 25 cents before being removed in 1969, following the completion of the Newport (Pell) Bridge. A formal dedication of the bridge commenced on the weekend of August 2 through August 4, 1940, with a military marine parade on the final day.|$|R
30|$|In addition, {{municipal}} staff made {{a variable}} {{use of the}} operational documents (maps) presenting {{the findings of the}} analysis of hazards and vulnerability. The submersion forecast maps that were provided to the PCC coordinator (Head of the municipal police) at various points during the crisis, in replacement for the maps he would normally had received from hydro-meteorological experts Predict (the municipality’s current service provider) were used properly. However, {{this was not the case}} with the maps showing people and buildings’ critical vulnerability levels, which could have informed the first protection measures (for instance, setting up <b>coffer</b> <b>dams)</b> taken by personnel on the ground. This challenge shows the necessity of providing the PCC staff with user-friendly documents that can be read quickly. Similar observations had been made during the crisis exercise organized for a group of municipalities in La Réunion by students from the École des Mines in Alès as part of the only other French program on submersion risk (Wassner et al. 2016) that also included an operational dimension and a crisis exercise.|$|R
5000|$|Harvey v. United States, , was a {{case for}} labor and {{materials}} furnished by the claimants in constructing <b>coffer</b> <b>dams</b> and in performing the work necessarily connected therewith and preliminary to the mason work for the piers and abutments {{referred to in the}} contract. That court proceeded on the view that the claimants had no right to rely on the testimony of experts introduced by them as to the value of the work, but should have kept and produced accounts of its cost and expense, but it gave to the claimants the benefit of the testimony of experts introduced by the United States as to such value in awarding the above amount. Held that the claimants could not be deprived of reasonable compensation for their work because they did not produce evidence of the character referred to, when it did not appear that such evidence existed, if the evidence they produced was the best evidence accessible to them and it enabled the court to arrive at a proper conclusion.|$|R
