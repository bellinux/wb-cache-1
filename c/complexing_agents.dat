First, minerals such as monazite or xenotime are dissolved into various acids, such as sulfuric acid. Ytterbium can then be separated from other lanthanides by ion exchange, as can other lanthanides.

The transmittances of the prepared films from the solution adding N 2 H 4 in as second <b>complexing</b> <b>agent</b> were over 85 %, compared to those from the solution without N 2 H 4 (over 95 %). The band gaps of the ZnS films from the solution using N 2 H 4 as second <b>complexing</b> <b>agent</b> were larger (about 4. 0 eV) than that from those from the solution without N 2 H 4 (about 3. 98 eV), which indicated that the prepared ZnS films from the solution adding N 2 H 4 in as second <b>complexing</b> <b>agent</b> were better used as buffer layer of solar cells with adequate optical properties.
