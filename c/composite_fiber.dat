The <b>composite</b> <b>fibers</b> were {{prepared}} from chitosan and gelatin by spinning their aqueous solution at 25 °C and by coagulating with NaOH aqueous solution containing ethanol. The mechanical {{properties of the}} fibers were measured. The results demonstrate that due {{to the presence of}} gelation in the <b>composite</b> <b>fibers,</b> the mechanical properties of the <b>composite</b> <b>fibers</b> increase, and the tensile strength of the <b>composite</b> <b>fibers</b> is also related to gelation content and the degree of deacetylation of chitosan. The optimum tensile strength values of 1. 99 cN/d (dry state) and 0. 98 cN/d (wet state) were obtained when gelation content was 30 wt%. The test of biodegradability demonstrates that the rate of degradation of <b>composite</b> <b>fibers</b> by lysozyme is reduced.

The mechanical properties of PVA/MWNT <b>composite</b> <b>fibers</b> were obviously superior to pure PVA fiber.

Meanwhile, the tensile strength increased gradually from 0. 39  GPa for the pure PVA fiber to 0. 74  GPa for the <b>composite</b> <b>fibers</b> with 14. 4  wt% MWNTs. Nevertheless, the tensile strength of the <b>composite</b> <b>fibers</b> decreased as the MWNTs content up to 27. 6  wt%.

As top speeds increased, more attention was paid to driver safety, much like with driver safety programs being instituted in most motor racing series today, such as NASCAR, Formula One, INDYCAR, Grand Prix motorcycle racing, and others.

He was even once close to being captured by S.H.I.E.L.D. when a mission went bad in Russia. Henry Hayes was often memory-wiped and did not remember his assignments. While at MTA Metro-North station, he tried to engage discussion with another leg amputee and advised him to contact Biotek, as his own prosthesis (plastic ones as it was the only his pension afforded him) forced the man to use crutches. This man left, seemingly displeased with the discussion. Immediately afterward, he met Seth Horne, a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent off duty who was present when the Eye of the Watcher exploded, releasing a blast of energy which revealed deep secrets to anyone in its radius. To Horne was revealed Hayes' true story. This level four agent wanted to congratulate him, stating that S.H.I.E.L.D. would wish to have him in their ranks. As Henry Hayes really did not know what Horne was talking about, he threatened to call the authorities forcing the agent to leave after a last congratulation. Immediately, Henry Hayes was ordered to kill him as the announcement board of the station indicated the words [...] "Whiskey David" [...] triggering Henry Hayes' Deathlok persona. After following Seth Horne into the restroom Deathlok quickly executed him, left, took some medications, and returned to his civilian life heading to the train to join his daughter Aria.|$|E

The results show that when the GO content is 0. 3 %(mass fraction,the same below), the thermal property of the graphene oxide/polyimide <b>composite</b> <b>fibers</b> is the best. The mechanical and electrical properties are obriously improved {{by the addition of}} GO, graphitization degree also increases. When the <b>composite</b> carbon <b>fibers</b> are treated at 2800 ℃, GO content increases to 2. 0 %, the thermal conductivity of the <b>composite</b> graphite <b>fibers</b> reaches 435. 57 W&# 183;m - 1 &# 183;K - 1 and cross-section structures of carbon fibers are more compact...|$|R
40|$|<b>Composite</b> PVA/ZnO-nanorods <b>fibers,</b> {{synthesized}} through co-axial flux extrusion exhibit higher anisotropic photonic properties, both in absorption and emission, as {{a result}} of the collective alignment of the ZnO nanorods along the main axis of the PVA fiber. This photonic anisotropy is triggered by a synergistic interaction between the PVA matrix, stretched above the glass transition temperature (Tg), and cooled down under strain. Compared with non-elongated fibers that present an isotropic emission, <b>composite</b> <b>fibers</b> previously submitted to a tensile stress absorb selectively UV emission when the polarized laser beam is parallel to the main axis of the fiber. In addition, their photolumincescence is also anisotropic, with a waveguide behavior along the main axis of the fiber. Mechanical properties of these <b>composite</b> <b>fibers</b> are also drastically improved, compared with pure PVA fibers: the longitudinal Young modulus of these fibers is increased from 2 to 6 GPa upon ZnO addition, a value similar to those already observed for <b>composite</b> <b>fibers,</b> prepared either with carbon nanotubes, or V 2 O 5 macroscopic fibers.
