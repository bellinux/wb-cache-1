50|$|<b>Cydia</b> <b>pomonella</b> {{granulosis}} virus (CpGV) is a granulovirus {{belonging to}} the family Baculoviridae. It has a double-stranded DNA genome that is 123,500 base pairs in length with 143 ORFs. The virus forms small bodies called granules containing a single virion. CpGV is a virus of invertebrates - specifically <b>Cydia</b> <b>pomonella</b> or the Codling moth. CpGV is highly pathogenic, it {{is known as a}} fast GV - that is, one that will kill its host in the same instar as infection; thus, it is frequently used as a biological pesticide.|$|E
50|$|Betabaculovirus is a genus of viruses, in {{the family}} Baculoviridae. Arthropods serve as natural hosts. There are {{currently}} 17 species in this genus including the type species <b>Cydia</b> <b>pomonella</b> granulovirus.|$|E
50|$|The {{codling moth}} (<b>Cydia</b> <b>pomonella)</b> {{is a member}} of the Lepidopteran family Tortricidae. They are known as an {{agricultural}} pest. It is native to Europe and was introduced to North America, where it has become one of the regular pests of apple orchards. It is found almost worldwide. It also attacks pears, walnuts, and other tree fruits.|$|E
50|$|Nine {{species of}} Trichogramma are {{produced}} commercially in insectaries around the world, with 30 countries releasing them. Trichogramma {{are used for}} control on numerous crops and plants; these include cotton, sugarcane, vegetables, sugar beets, orchards and forests. Some of the pests that are controlled include Cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera), Codling moth (<b>Cydia</b> <b>pomonella),</b> Lightbrown apple moth (Epiphyas postvittana), and European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis).|$|E
50|$|The silk worm Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) was {{the first}} insect in which {{inherited}} sterility was reported. Then inherited sterility {{was reported in the}} greater wax moth Galleria mellonella (Lepidoptera:Pyralidae), in the codling moth <b>Cydia</b> <b>pomonella</b> (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), in the large milkweed bug Oncopeltus fasciatus (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae), in Gonocerus acuteangulatus (Hemiptera: Coreida), in Rhodnius prolixus (Hemiptera: Reduviidae), and in the Two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae (Acari: Tetranychidae).|$|E
50|$|The mutualistic {{association}} between Xenorhabdus and Steinernema represent an insectidical complex, active against a large range of insect pests. Indeed, the complex {{is used in}} biological pest control, and is very efficient against insects such as Spodoptera exigua (Lepidoptera), <b>Cydia</b> <b>pomonella</b> (Lepidoptera), Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Coleoptera), Tipulidae family (Diptera). Xenorhabdus nematofila is the most used species in biological control, in association with Steinernema carpocapse and Steinernema feltiae.|$|E
50|$|The adult {{apple sawfly}} {{is up to}} 5 mm long with a brownish-black head and thorax and a brown abdomen. The larva is a caterpillar-like grub with a brown head and white body, growing to about 10 mm when fully developed. It can be {{distinguished}} from the codling moth (<b>Cydia</b> <b>pomonella)</b> larva by being creamy-white, with seven pairs of abdominal legs, while the latter is pinkish-white and has five pairs. The sawfly larva is active in the fruits {{two or three weeks}} earlier in the season than the codling larva.|$|E
50|$|Bacillus thuringiensis is a {{bacterial}} disease that affects Lepidopterans {{and some other}} insects. Toxins produced by strains of this bacterium are used as a larvicide against caterpillars, beetles, and mosquitoes. Toxins from Saccharopolyspora spinosa are isolated from fermentations and sold as Spinosad. Because these toxins have little effect on other organisms, they are considered more environmentally friendly than synthetic pesticides. The toxin from B. thuringiensis (Bt toxin) has been incorporated directly into plants {{through the use of}} genetic engineering. Other biological insecticides include products based on entomopathogenic fungi (e.g., Beauveria bassiana, Metarhizium anisopliae), nematodes (e.g., Steinernema feltiae) and viruses (e.g., <b>Cydia</b> <b>pomonella</b> granulovirus).|$|E
50|$|The {{codling moth}} <b>Cydia</b> <b>pomonella</b> causes worm-holes in apples. It has been accidentally spread from its {{original}} range in Europe and is now found in North and South America, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand, wherever apples are grown. Control has required {{the use of the}} harshest available insecticides - historically lead arsenate and DDT were used for control. These chemicals brought considerable environmental dangers, and in any case the insect gradually developed resistance to them. Currently, organophosphate sprays are favored and are timed carefully to catch the hatching larvae before they can bore into the fruit.|$|E

50|$|Area-wide {{integrated}} {{pest management}} programmes using the sterile insect technique (SIT) as a component have been successful against a number of pest flies or Diptera such as the New World screwworm, Cochliomyia hominivorax, various species of tephritidae fruit flies and against tsetse flies (Glossinidae). However, most moths or lepidopterans are more resistant to radiation than dipterans, and as a consequence, the higher dose of radiation required to completely sterilize lepidopterans reduces their performance in the field. One approach to circumvent the negative effects associated with the high radio-resistance of Lepidoptera pests has been the use of inherited sterility or F1 sterility, first documented in studies on the codling moth (<b>Cydia</b> <b>pomonella).</b> Inherited sterility has also been documented in the Hemiptera order.|$|E
50|$|A further {{topic of}} Dallinger’s {{ecotoxicological}} {{research has focused}} on aspects of microevolution and adaptation of species and populations to contaminants (metals, pesticides) in combination with different anthropogenic stressors. It could be shown, for example, that the widespread apple pest species, <b>Cydia</b> <b>pomonella,</b> has split into varied adaptable populations over small-scale areas in the alpine region under the selective pressure of pesticide application. Many of these populations have been able to acquire pesticide resistance. Another example of microevolutionary adaptation to environmental pollution has been demonstrated by Dallinger and coworkers in populations of the freshwater sludge worm, Tubifex tubifex. Due to historic and recent metal pollution in European river systems, native populations of this species have split into lineages and cryptic species that differ with respect to their metal resistance.|$|E
50|$|In {{the past}} and recently, trunk {{injection}} of pesticides and plant resistance activators has been investigated in agriculture for control of pathogens and insect pests on fruit tree crops and grapevines. The most investigated are diseases and pests of avocado, apple, and grapevine, such as Phytophthora root rot of avocado Phytophthora cinnamomi and avocado thrips Scirtothrips perseae, fire blight Erwinia amylovora and apple scab Venturia inaequalis, oblique banded leaf roller Choristoneura rosaceana and codling moth <b>Cydia</b> <b>pomonella,</b> and grapevine downy mildew Plasmopara viticola and powdery mildew Uncinula necator. Apple trees are especially interesting as a research model in agriculture since {{it is known that}} apple production requires intensive spray schedules for control of pathogenic fungus V. inaequalis with as many as 15-22 sprays of fungicides per season in humid climate. Hence, trunk injection of pesticides is considered as an option for precise compound delivery which will reduce the negative impact of drift-driven pesticide losses in the environment, that occur after each spraying. Besides negative consequences of frequent pesticide applications in the environment, stem injection of grapevines is investigated in viticulture for control of pathogens with difficult biologies which infect and destroy woody tissues and that cannot be controlled efficiently by canopy spray applications of fungicides. To increase the efficiency of injected compounds in trees and vines, important considerations are plant anatomy, weather and soil conditions, tree physiology processes, spatial and temporal distribution of injected compound, and the chemical properties of injected compound and formulation.|$|E

40|$|Summary During the {{infection}} of Lepidoptera larvae with baculoviruses the horizontal escape of Tc 1 -like transposons, termed TCl 4. 7 and TCp 3. 2, from the genome {{of the host}} Cryptophlebia leucotreta and <b>Cydia</b> <b>pomonella</b> into the genome of <b>Cydia</b> <b>pomonella</b> granulovirus was observed. In this study we addressed the question whether the transposon harboring viruses had a replication advantage over the wild-type and became dominant in the virus population or whether {{the activity of the}} host transposable elements is stimulated by virus infection. Biological characterization studies demonstrated that the transposon containing viruses killed C. pomonella larvae slower than CpGV-M. In co-infection experiments of C. pomonella larvae using a mixture of CpGV-M and mutant viruses as inoculum, it was shown that the transposon carrying mutants had a significant selection disadvantage compared to CpGV-M. Transcription levels of the transposase gene of TCp 3. 2 were investigated in virus infected and uninfected larvae. These experiments demonstrated that a higher level of transposase transcription was detectable in CpGV-M infected than in mock infected control larvae. This observation gave strong evidence that CpGV-M infection might trigger the activity of transposon TCp 3. 2 within the genome of <b>Cydia</b> <b>pomonella.</b> Our results suggest that the horizontal transfer of insect host transposons into baculovirus genomes might be induced by virus infection...|$|E

40|$|Abstract-In {{field and}} {{laboratory}} bioassay experiments, {{we show that}} larvae of the codling moth, <b>Cydia</b> <b>pomonella,</b> cocoon in aggregations. This aggregation behavior of fifth-instar larvae prior to pupation and arrestment of eclosed adult males by mature female pupae seems to allow mating as soon as an adult female ecloses. This synchronous timing is realized because foraging fifth-instar are attracted by cocoon-spinning larvae and prepupae, but not by pupae, and because male pupae develop faster than female pupae. Eclosed males are arrested by sex pheromone that disseminates from female pupae even before adult females eclose. Communication in C. pomonella within and among developmental stages (larva-larva and pupa-adult, respectively) may be a strategy to procure mates. If so, our data add to current knowledge that attraction of mates in insects relies on communication among adults, or pupae and adults.
