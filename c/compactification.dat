5|$|A {{standard}} analogy for <b>compactification</b> is {{to consider}} a multidimensional object such as a garden hose. If the hose is viewed from a sufficient distance, {{it appears to have}} only one dimension, its length, but as one approaches the hose, one discovers that it contains a second dimension, its circumference. Thus, an ant crawling inside it would move in two dimensions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Compactification</b> {{can be used}} to {{construct}} models in which spacetime is effectively four-dimensional. However, not every way of compactifying the extra dimensions produces a model with the right properties to describe nature. In a viable model of particle physics, the compact extra dimensions must be shaped like a Calabi–Yau manifold. A Calabi–Yau manifold is a special space which is typically taken to be six-dimensional in applications to string theory. It is named after mathematicians Eugenio Calabi and Shing-Tung Yau.|$|E
5|$|After Calabi–Yau {{manifolds}} {{had entered}} physics {{as a way}} to compactify extra dimensions, many physicists began studying these manifolds. In the late 1980s, Lance Dixon, Wolfgang Lerche, Cumrun Vafa, and Nick Warner noticed that given such a <b>compactification</b> of string theory, {{it is not possible to}} reconstruct uniquely a corresponding Calabi–Yau manifold. Instead, two different versions of string theory called type IIA string theory and type IIB can be compactified on completely different Calabi–Yau manifolds giving rise to the same physics. In this situation, the manifolds are called mirror manifolds, and the relationship between the two physical theories is called mirror symmetry.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} this progress, the {{relationship}} between strings and five-dimensional branes remained conjectural because theorists were unable to quantize the branes. Starting in 1991, {{a team of researchers}} including Michael Duff, Ramzi Khuri, Jianxin Lu, and Ruben Minasian considered a special <b>compactification</b> of string theory in which four of the ten dimensions curl up. If one considers a five-dimensional brane wrapped around these extra dimensions, then the brane looks just like a one-dimensional string. In this way, the conjectured relationship between strings and branes was reduced to a relationship between strings and strings, and the latter could be tested using already established theoretical techniques.|$|E
5|$|Supersymmetry {{severely}} {{restricts the}} possible number of dimensions of a brane. In 1987, Eric Bergshoeff, Ergin Sezgin, and Paul Townsend showed that eleven-dimensional supergravity includes two-dimensional branes. Intuitively, these objects look like sheets or membranes propagating through the eleven-dimensional spacetime. Shortly after this discovery, Michael Duff, Paul Howe, Takeo Inami, and Kellogg Stelle considered a particular <b>compactification</b> of eleven-dimensional supergravity {{with one of}} the dimensions curled up into a circle. In this setting, one can imagine the membrane wrapping around the circular dimension. If the radius of the circle is sufficiently small, then this membrane looks just like a string in ten-dimensional spacetime. In fact, Duff and his collaborators showed that this construction reproduces exactly the strings appearing in type IIA superstring theory.|$|E
5|$|Typically, such {{models are}} based on the idea of <b>compactification.</b> Starting with the ten- or eleven-dimensional spacetime of string or M-theory, {{physicists}} postulate a shape for the extra dimensions. By choosing this shape appropriately, they can construct models roughly similar to the standard model of particle physics, together with additional undiscovered particles, usually supersymmetric partners to analogues of known particles. One popular way of deriving realistic physics from string theory is to start with the heterotic theory in ten dimensions and assume that the six extra dimensions of spacetime are shaped like a six-dimensional Calabi–Yau manifold. This is a special kind of geometric object named after mathematicians Eugenio Calabi and Shing-Tung Yau. Calabi–Yau manifolds offer many ways of extracting realistic physics from string theory. Other similar methods can be used to construct models with physics resembling to some extent that of our four-dimensional world based on M-theory.|$|E

In past few years there has been interest in investigating perturbative [1] and nonperturbative string warped <b>compactifications</b> [2, 3, 4, 5].

40|$|We study string <b>compactifications</b> with sixteen supersymmetries. The moduli {{space for}} these <b>compactifications</b> becomes quite {{intricate}} in lower dimensions, partly {{because there are}} many different irreducible components. We focus primarily, but not exclusively, on <b>compactifications</b> to seven or more dimensions. These vacua can be realized in a number ways: the perturbative constructions we study include toroidal <b>compactifications</b> of the heterotic/type I strings, asymmetric orbifolds, and orientifolds. In addition, we describe less conventional M and F theory <b>compactifications</b> on smooth spaces. The last class of vacua considered are <b>compactifications</b> on singular spaces with non-trivial discrete fluxes. We find a number of new components in the string moduli space. Contained in some of these components are M theory <b>compactifications</b> with novel kinds of ``frozen'' singularities. We are naturally led to conjecture the existence of new dualities relating spaces with different singular geometries and fluxes. As our study of these vacua unfolds, we also learn about additional topics including: F theory on spaces without section, automorphisms of del Pezzo surfaces, and novel physics (and puzzles) from equivariant K-theory.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we study}} compactifiations of ten-dimensional heterotic supergravity at O(α'), {{focusing}} on the moduli of such <b>compactifications.</b> We begin by studying supersymmetric <b>compactifications</b> to four-dimensional maximally symmetric space, {{commonly referred to as}} the Strominger system. The <b>compactifications</b> are of the form M 10 = M 4 x X, where M 4 is four-dimensional Minkowski space, and X is a six-dimensional manifold of what we refer to as heterotic SU (3) -structure. We show that this system can be put in terms of a holomorphic operator D on a bundle Q = T* X ⊕ End(TX) ⊕ End(V) ⊕ TX, defined by a series of extensions. Here V is the E 8 x E 8 gauge-bundle, and TX is the tangent bundle of the compact space X. We proceed to compute the infinitesimal deformation space of this structure, given by TM = H (0, 1) (Q), which constitutes the infinitesimal spectrum of the lower energy four-dimensional theory. In doing so, we find an over counting of moduli by H (0, 1) (End(TX)), which can be reinterpreted as O(α') field redefinitions. In the next part of the thesis, we consider non-maximally symmetric <b>compactifications</b> of the form M 10 = M 3 x Y, where M 3 is three-dimensional Minkowski space, and Y is a seven-dimensional non-compact manifold with a G 2 -structure. We write X → Y → ℝ, where X is a six dimensional compact space of half- at SU (3) -structure, non-trivially fibered over ℝ. These <b>compactifications</b> are known as domain wall <b>compactifications.</b> By focusing on coset <b>compactifications,</b> we show that the compact space X can be endowed with non-trivial torsion, which {{can be used in a}} combination with %alpha;'-effects to stabilise all geometric moduli. The domain wall can further be lifted to a maximally symmetric AdS vacuum by inclusion of non-perturbative effects in a heterotic KKLT scenario. Finally, we consider domain wall <b>compactifications</b> where X is a Calabi-Yau. We show that by considering such <b>compactifications,</b> one can evade the usual no-go theorems for flux in Calabi-Yau <b>compactifications,</b> allowing flux to be used as a tool in such <b>compactifications,</b> even when X is Kähler. The ultimate success of these <b>compactifications</b> depends on the possibility of lifting such vacua to maximally symmetric ones by means of e. g. non-perturbative effects.
