The ship was assigned convoy escort duties in the Atlantic after the start of World War II in September 1939 until she was committed to the English Channel after the Battle of France began in May 1940. Chacal was <b>crippled</b> <b>by</b> German bombers and artillery on 23/24 May and had to beach herself near Boulogne-sur-Mer.|$|E

5|$|After {{wintering}} in {{the western}} coastlands of Asia Minor, the Arab army crossed into Thrace in early summer 717 and built siege lines to blockade the city, which was protected by the massive Theodosian Walls. The Arab fleet, which accompanied the land army and was meant to complete the city's blockade by sea, was neutralized soon after its arrival by the Byzantine navy {{through the use of}} Greek fire. This allowed Constantinople to be resupplied by sea, while the Arab army was <b>crippled</b> <b>by</b> famine and disease during the unusually hard winter that followed. In spring 718, two Arab fleets sent as reinforcements were destroyed by the Byzantines after their Christian crews defected, and an additional army sent overland through Asia Minor was ambushed and defeated. Coupled with attacks by the Bulgars on their rear, the Arabs were forced to lift the siege on 15 August 718. On its return journey, the Arab fleet was almost completely destroyed by natural disasters and Byzantine attacks.|$|E
5|$|Docherty {{remained}} {{a member of}} the Communist Party for 70 years, at times working with Alex Moffat and Abe Moffat. She campaigned for J. V. Leckie when he was a candidate for the Dunfermline Burghs constituency. She worked for Willie Gallacher, the communist Member of Parliament for Fife, for several years, and in 1952 unsuccessfully ran for a city council seat. At various points, Docherty held the positions of treasurer, Women's Group leader, and secretary for the Fife branch of the Communist Party. She retired from active political life when she was 60 years old, but despite being <b>crippled</b> <b>by</b> arthritis, participated in fundraising efforts for the newspaper Morning Star. She lived in a modest house in Cowdenbeath, and spent her time working on her memoirs. She continued to give talks and participate in International Women's Day events nearly every year until her death.|$|E
5|$|Illustrious, {{the fourth}} ship of her name, was ordered {{as part of}} the 1936 Naval Programme from Vickers-Armstrongs on 13 April 1937. Construction was delayed by slow {{deliveries}} of her armour plates because the industry had been <b>crippled</b> <b>by</b> a lack of orders over the last 15 years {{as a result of the}} Washington Naval Treaty. As a consequence, her flight-deck armour had to be ordered from Vítkovice Mining and Iron Corporation in Czechoslovakia. She was laid down at their Barrow-in-Furness shipyard two weeks later as yard number 732 and launched on 5 April 1939. She was christened by Lady Henderson, wife of the recently retired Third Sea Lord. Illustrious was then towed to Buccleuch Dock for fitting out and Captain Denis Boyd was appointed to command her on 29 January 1940. She was commissioned on 16 April 1940 and, excluding her armament, she cost £2,295,000 to build.|$|E

5|$|She {{fought with}} the Spanish Republican Navy in the Spanish Civil War. At the {{outbreak}} of the Nationalist revolt, wireless operators in the navy headquarters Madrid intercepted radio messages from General Francisco Franco to rebels in Morocco. They alerted the crews aboard Jaime I and other ships, who mutinied against their rebellious officers and ensured the ships would remain under Republican control. The vessels were nevertheless <b>crippled</b> <b>by</b> poor discipline for some time, as they had murdered many of their officers, and distrusted those that were not killed. On the first months of the war, Jaime I shelled a number of rebel strongholds, among them Ceuta, Melilla and Algeciras. In Algeciras she hit with her secondary armament the Nationalist gunboat Eduardo Dato, which was burned down to the waterline, although she was later repaired and returned to service.|$|E
5|$|Shipping {{incidents}} {{resulting from}} the storm caused several deaths. A schooner carrying seven people sunk, killing all its occupants. A tug boat sank {{off the coast of}} Mobile, Alabama while towing a lumber barge; the fate of the crew is unknown. A ship named the American SS Catopazi sank between Charleston, South Carolina and the northern coast of Cuba, with all 30 crew members lost. Near Daytona Beach, a vessel carrying 2,000 cases of liquor sank along with all six crewmen. The last incident, involving a yacht, occurred off the coast of Georgia. The ship sank near Savannah, Georgia with the 12 crew members drowning. The total loss of life at sea was at least 55. Shipping throughout the East Coast was <b>crippled</b> <b>by</b> the storm as vessels were forced to seek shelter at port.|$|E

5|$|The {{efficiency}} of the British blockade was such that communication and reinforcement between France and her colonies was dangerous for the ships involved and so was severely limited. This led to shortages and disaffection among the French colonists, especially in the Caribbean, where they were surrounded by hostile British harbours and constantly raided and blockaded by British ships. The island of Martinique {{was one of the}} more important French islands in the West Indies, but by late 1808 the island's economy had been <b>crippled</b> <b>by</b> the British blockade, and food stocks, military supplies and morale were all running low. In the summer a French dispatch vessel was intercepted by British warships, warning of the desperate state of the island's defences; similar messages that did reach France safely prompted an urgent response by the French Navy.|$|E
5|$|At {{the village}} of Kusić in Banat, a man named Ilija Bordan was {{regarded}} to be alovit; the villagers talked {{that he had a}} tail. Whenever a thunderstorm came, his appearance changed—he fought with an ala. If the ala was overwhelming him, Ilija would lie down and sleep, and if he was overpowering her, the clouds would start to dissipate. There was a tale in the same village about an alovit man who would warn the villagers of the approach of a thunderstorm, before he took a wagon pole on his back and flew into the clouds. At {{the village of}} Sokolovac in Banat, people told of an alovit man who had four nipples. At the sight of hail clouds, he would mount his mare and disappear for several days. The latter two men would come back tired, bruised, and with torn clothes. As held in the central Serbian region of Gruža, men could become dragonlike. As such, they would suddenly disappear during thunderstorms, and fly into the dark clouds to fight against ale. They were characterized as nimble, hot-tempered, rash and very strong. At a village near Radomir in western Bulgaria, there was a dragon man who was said to have been physically <b>crippled</b> <b>by</b> an ala.|$|E
5|$|HMS Illustrious was {{the lead}} ship of her class of {{aircraft}} carriers built for the Royal Navy before World War II. Her first assignment after completion and working up was with the Mediterranean Fleet, in which her aircraft's most notable achievement was sinking one Italian battleship and badly damaging two others during the Battle of Taranto in late 1940. Two months later the carrier was <b>crippled</b> <b>by</b> German dive bombers and was repaired in the United States. After sustaining damage on the voyage home in late 1941 by a collision with her sister ship , Illustrious {{was sent to the}} Indian Ocean in early 1942 to support the invasion of Vichy French Madagascar (Operation Ironclad). After returning home in early 1943, the ship was given a lengthy refit and briefly assigned to the Home Fleet. She was transferred to Force H for the Battle of Salerno in mid-1943 and then rejoined the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean at the beginning of 1944. Her aircraft attacked several targets in the Japanese-occupied Dutch East Indies over the following year before Illustrious was transferred to the newly formed British Pacific Fleet (BPF). The carrier participated {{in the early stages of}} the Battle of Okinawa until mechanical defects arising from accumulated battle damage became so severe that she was ordered home early for repairs in May 1945.|$|E

50|$|In 1886-95 {{the church}} was rebuilt in Neo-Renaissance style, {{resulting}} in a much larger building with two prominent towers and a large dome. The contest for the reconstruction design was announced on 14 April 1883 and the construction was entrusted to {{the author of the}} victorious design Józef Pius Dziekoński. The original rotunda was enlarged by adding three naves from the Ujazdowskie Avenue and two towers, enhancing the walls and the dome. The southern portico was embellished with relief of Blessing Christ among the Indigents and <b>Cripples</b> <b>by</b> Jan Kryński and sculptures by Teofil Gosecki.

5|$|Power and {{communications}} across Rodrigues {{and the island}} of Mauritius were <b>crippled</b> <b>by</b> the storm, with {{the entirety of the}} former and 90 percent of the latter losing electricity. For approximately ten hours, the country was cut off from the outside world, with all communications disrupted. About 50,000 of the nation's 280,000 telecommunication lines sustained serious damage, resulting in prolonged power outages. Repair crews estimated that it would take until January 27, nearly a week after the storm's passage, for power to be fully restored. Widespread areas also lost water on Mauritius. Schools across the region sustained significant damage and as a precautionary measure, all classes were canceled until January 29. Agriculture sustained considerable losses {{as a result of the}} storm. Approximately 15 metric tons of flour and 20 metric tons of rice were damaged and preliminary estimates for sugarcane losses across the island reached US$47 million. Property damage from the storm amounted to US$50 million, and there were four deaths on the island; three were caused by traffic accidents, and the other was a man who died while making storm preparations.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to nationalise AESC and develop Leigh Creek {{proved to be}} prescient. In early 1947, mines in New South Wales were again <b>crippled</b> <b>by</b> strikes. The worst strike came in 1949, forcing Chifley to send {{in the armed forces}} to extract coal. While the other states had to suffer industrial power rationing and thus reduced manufacturing output and more unemployment, South Australia managed to escape as the miners at Leigh Creek worked around the clock. Within four years the mine was operating at a surplus and the town was further rewarded with federal funding. From 1947 until the end of Playford's leadership in 1965, the output of the mine increased tenfold to almost two million tons a year. Transport infrastructure was improved, European immigrant workers were recruited, and twin power plants at Port Augusta were completed in 1960 and named after the premier. The new plants exclusively used Leigh Creek coal and by 1970, the whole state was self-sufficient for electricity. ETSA and the mine were generating enough revenue to maintain the town—sometimes dubbed Uncle Tom's Baby—and mine of Leigh Creek and making a profit as well. From 1946 to 1965, the proportion of South Australians connected to electricity increased from 70 to 96%.|$|E
5|$|The four {{ships that}} {{remained}} with the Mediterranean Fleet sank three Italian submarines in 1940 while escorting Malta convoys and larger warships of the fleet. Several {{participated in the}} Battles of Calabria and Cape Spartivento that year. Duncan joined Force H at Gibraltar in October and escorted that group. Dainty was sunk by German bombers in February 1941 and Diamond in April while evacuating Allied personnel from Greece. Defender had to be scuttled in July when she was <b>crippled</b> <b>by</b> a German bomber when returning from escorting a convoy to Tobruk. Duncan and Decoy remained on escort duties {{for the rest of}} the year before being transferred to the Eastern Fleet in early 1942. They returned to the UK late in the year to begin conversions to escort destroyers. Decoy was transferred to the RCN in early 1943, but both became convoy escorts in the Atlantic. They sank two German submarines before being assigned to the UK to protect Allied shipping during Operation Overlord. They sank three more submarines before the end of the war and were paid off in 1945. Duncan was scrapped 1945–49 and Decoy during 1946.|$|E
