50|$|One of the {{challenges}} of cancer treatment is how to destroy malignant tumors without damaging healthy cells. A new method that shows great promise for accomplishing this employs {{the use of a}} suicide gene. A suicide gene is a gene which will cause a cell to kill itself through apoptosis. There are currently two methods of suicide gene therapy being used. Gene-directed enzyme-producing therapy (GDEPT) uses a gene taken from the cancer cell and then modified with other genes to form enzymes that are harmless to healthy cells. This foreign enzyme is inserted into the tumor cells where it releases a prodrug, which is a small molecule harmless to healthy cells, but destructive to cancerous cells. The modified suicide gene converts the non-toxic prodrug into a <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>substance.</b> The second method of suicide gene therapy is called virus-directed enzyme-prodrug therapy. This uses a virus, such as herpes simplex or cold virus, as the carrier, or vector, to deliver the modified genes to the cancer cells. Suicide gene therapy is not necessarily expected to completely eliminate the need for chemotherapy and radiation treatment for all cancerous tumors. The damage inflicted upon the tumor cells, however, makes them more susceptible to the chemo or radiation. This approach has already proven effective against prostate and bladder cancers. The application of suicide gene therapy is being expanded to several other forms of cancer as well. Cancer patients often experience depressed immune systems, so they can suffer some side effects of the use of a virus as a delivery agent.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Chemotherapy is {{a common}} method used for cancer treatment. Especially when it {{concerns}} cancers that have grown invasively {{it seems to be}} the only efficient treatment due to the substances ability to reach and affect almost the entire body. One major obstacle regarding chemotherapy is that the patients often develop resistance to the <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>substances</b> used. Fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay (FMCA) is a method developed to measure sensitivity of tumor cells to different <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>substances</b> in vitro. The assay is based on hydrolysis of fluorescein diacetate to fluorescein by cells with intact cell membranes after incubation with drugs for 72 hours. This study investigated the impact of two methodological factors that may cause errors in the achieved results; namely the possible occurrence of drug decay during incubation and the use of an inappropriate amount of cells. These factors were tested by exposing the cytotoxic drugs to pre-incubation in absence of tumor cells for different times and to use suspensions with different concentrations of cells. The results indicated occurrence of drug decay in 3 of the 18 substances tested and that the amount of cells affected the results for most of the drugs tested but to different extent...|$|R

40|$|Summary. Cytopathic {{effects of}} broth-culture filtrates from eight {{clinical}} isolates and one reference strain of Helicobacter pylori on three cultured mammalian cell lines were investigated. All the strains, including NCTC 1 1637, produced cytotoxic factors that caused intracellular vacuolation on these cell lines. AGS and SflEp cells were {{more sensitive than}} HEp- 2 cells. To examine the role of urease in the cytotoxic effect, a urease-negative mutant was produced. Filtrates from both wild-type and mutant strains produced similar vacuolation on Sfl Ep cells {{in the absence of}} urea, suggesting that H. pylori produces a <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>substance</b> other than urease. In contrast, ammonia alone, or jack bean urease with urea, also induced rounding and detachment of Sfl Ep cells, whereas ammonium salts induced the production of small vacuoles. The combination of the broth filtrate of the wild-type strain and urea induced vacuolation followed by rounding and detachment of SflEp cells. Evidence is presented that the latter changes are due to ammonia produced during incubation. Nevertheless, the amounts produced were less than that needed to induce cytopathic effects by itself. These results suggest that the <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>substance</b> induces intracellular vacuolation, and that the vacuolated cells are more susceptible to killing by ammonia. Thus both the <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>substance</b> and urease may contribute to the lethal cytotoxicity of H. pylori in vitro...|$|E

40|$|Summary. Bacteria {{present in}} the human gut may produce methylglyoxal-a <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>substance</b> in mammals.

Proteus spp. produced large amounts of methylglyoxal and had the greatest methylglyoxal synthase activity. Supplementing defined medium for facultative anaerobes with glucose 1 % w/v did not significantly alter enzyme activity or methylglyoxal production.

Here, we determined whether or not the larval form of the mealworm beetle Tenebrio molitor, a species of darkling beetle, contains <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>substances</b> that exclusively affect cancer cell viability. Ethanol extract and its solvent partitioned fractions, hexane and ethyl acetate fractions, showed anticancer effects against various human cancer cells derived from the prostate (PC 3 and 22 Rv 1), cervix (HeLa), liver (PLC/PRF 5, HepG 2, Hep 3 B, and SK-HEP- 1), colon (HCT 116), lung (NCI-H 460), breast (MDA-MB 231), and ovary (SKOV 3). Cell death induced by the fractions was a mix of apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy. The hexane fraction was administered intraperitoneally to nude mice bearing a hepatocellular carcinoma SK-HEP- 1 and showed inhibition of tumor growth in vivo. Therefore, we concluded that worm extracts contain <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>substances,</b> which can be enriched by proper fractionation protocols, and further separation and purification could lead to the identification of novel molecules to treat human cancers. © 2015, Korean Society of Food Science and Nutrition.

40|$|Tumor {{metastasis}} is {{a complex}} process where malign tumor cells detach from the primary tumor and invade the blood stream. There the tumor cells interact with platelets or the endothelium before they invade the surrounding tissue to develop new metastases. Several studies showed, that circulating tumor cells are able to activate platelets which results {{in the development of}} tumor cell-platelet aggregates. These complexes can adhere easily to the endothelium in small blood vessels, which enhances tumor cell extravasation and metastasis. The aim of this PhD thesis was the development of a liposomal system that encapsulates a <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>substance</b> and a platelet aggregation inhibitor {{at the same time to}} obtain an effective inhibition of metastasis. These liposomes should reduce platelet aggregation and complex formation of tumor cells and platelets and therefore reduce metastasis in different mouse models in vivo. Dual liposomes which contain two different active drugs were prepared by lipid film-hydration method. The vesicles were characterized regarding their stability and their drug and lipid content. The inhibition of platelet aggregation by dual liposomes in vitro was characterized with an impedance aggregometer. The complex formation of tumor cells in the presence of activated platelets was quantified microscopically. After characterization of the mouse metastasis models, the anti-metastatic effect of the dual liposomes was quantified in an experimental and a spontaneous metastasis model in mice. Liposomes were prepared, that encapsulate the cytotoxic alkylphospholipid OPP and one of the platelet aggregation inhibitors Dipyridamol (DIP/OPP-L) or Cilostazol (Cil/OPP-L) in their membrane. DIP/OPP-L and Cil/OPP-L were able to reduce platelet aggregation in vitro by 60 % and 80 %, respectively and completely abolished complex formation of tumor cells in the presence of activated platelets. In vivo both dual liposomal formulations could reduce metastasis by up to 90 % in the experimental MT 3 metastasis model and up to 50 % in the spontaneous metastasis model using 4 T 1 breast cancer cells. This project demonstrated, that liposomes containing a combination of a <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>substance</b> and a platelet aggregation inhibitor are able to influence the interaction between circulating tumor cells and platelets and thereby reducing metastases formation in different mouse models. Those newly developed liposomes are a promising method to reduce metastasis...|$|E

40|$|Neurological {{function}} deficits due to cerebral ischemia or neurodegenerative {{diseases such}} as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) have long been considered a thorny issue in clinical treatment. Recovery after neurologic impairment is fairly limited, which poses {{a major threat to}} health and quality of life. Accumulating evidences support that ROS and autophagy are both implicated in the onset and development of neurological disorders. Notably, oxidative stress triggered by excess of ROS not only puts the brain in a vulnerable state but also enhances the virulence of other pathogenic factors, just like mitochondrial dysfunction, which is described as the culprit of nerve cell damage. Nevertheless, autophagy is proposed as a subtle cellular defense mode against destructive stimulus by timely removal of damaged and <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>substance.</b> Emerging evidence suggests that the interplay of ROS and autophagy may establish a determinant role in the modulation of neuronal homeostasis.

40|$|In {{about half}} of all newly {{diagnosed}} cancer cases, conventional treatment is not adequately curative, mainly due to the failure of conventional techniques to find and kill residual cells and metastases, which might consist of only a few malignant cells, without causing unacceptable complications to healthy tissue. To solve the problem a more selective delivery of <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>substances</b> to tumour cells is needed. The approach applied here is called ‘tumour targeting’ and implies the use of biomolecules that recognise specific molecular structures on the malignant cell surface. Such molecules are then used for a selective transport of toxic agents to the cancer cells. The use of radionuclides as <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>substances</b> has a number of advantages: 1) radiation does not cause severe resistance; 2) there is a cross-fire effect and 3) smaller amounts of nuclides are required than other <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>substances</b> to cause the same damage. Such an approach is called radionuclide tumour therapy. Several factors are important for the success of radionuclide therapy, such as the pharmacokinetics of the radiolabelled substance and its radiocatabolites, as well as the physical and chemical properties of the radiolabel used. Nuclear properties of the label should be consistent with the problem to be solved: primary diagnostics; quantification of pharmacokinetics and dose planning; or therapy. From this point of view, radiohalogens are an attractive group of radiolabels. Halogens have nuclides with a variety of physical properties while the chemical and biological properties of halogens are very similar. The same labelling procedures can be used for all heavy halogens, i. e. bromine, iodine and astatine. It has been demonstrated that the biodistribution of proteins labelled with different heavy halogens is quite similar. The main goal {{of the study was to}} develop protein radiohalogenation methods that provide a stable halogen-protein bond, convenient labelling chemistry that preserves the binding properties of proteins, long intracellular retention of radioactivity in targeted cells and quick release of radiohalogenated catabolites from the blood circulation. Radiohalogenation of proteins using indirect methods was studied, including optimisation of labelling chemistry and biological characterisation of some labelled conjugates. Two groups for indirect radiohalogenation were used, representing two different labelling principles: activated ester of benzoic acid (1) and the derivative of closo-dodecaborate anion (2). The non-phenolic linker (1) as well as the borate-halogen moiety (2) probably prevent dehalogenation. The negative charge of the potential catabolic products of (2) might trap radiohalogens intracellularly...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{carrageenan}} {{model for}} ulcerative colitis {{has been studied}} {{in an effort to}} define the role of bacteria in the experimental disease. It was found that guinea pigs given a 5 % w/v carrageenan solution developed cecal ulcerations within 14 days which were histologically similar to lesions seen in the human disease. Bacteriological studies of the cecal contents of carrageenan recipients indicated that both the coliform and. gram negative anaerobic bacterial counts were increased as compared to bacterial counts obtained from healthy control animals. Suppression of cecal bacterial populations with oral antimicrobial agents during carrageenan challenge was used to determine whether specific microfiora populations were necessary for ulceration. It was found that antimicrobials active versus obligate anaerobes prevented cecal ulceration in carrageenan recipients, while antimicrobials active versus gram positive organisms or coliforms did not suppress ulcer development. It was also noted that germ-free animals given carrageenan did not develop typical lesions, but germ-free animals associated with a conventional microflora acquired cecal ulcerations during carrageenan challenge. These results suggest that bacteria are an important factor in the development of experimental ulcerative colitis.
