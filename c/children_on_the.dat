5|$|Kyle is a third- then fourth-grade {{student who}} {{commonly}} has extraordinary experiences not typical of conventional small-town {{life in his}} fictional hometown of South Park, Colorado. Kyle is distinctive {{as one of the}} few Jewish <b>children</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> show, and because of this, he often feels like an outsider amongst the core group of characters. His portrayal in this role is often dealt with satirically, and has elicited both praise and criticism from Jewish viewers.|$|E
5|$|The {{island of}} Egholm {{contains}} the former Egholm Skole, which was closed in 1972 when a ferry service to Aalborg was established and <b>children</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island began attending the Vesterkæret Skole in Aalborg.

5|$|About 20% of <b>children</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{ketogenic}} diet achieve {{freedom from}} seizures, {{and many are}} able to reduce the use of anticonvulsant drugs or eliminate them altogether. Commonly, at around two years on the diet, or {{after six months of}} being seizure-free, the diet may be gradually discontinued over two or three months. This is done by lowering the ketogenic ratio until urinary ketosis is no longer detected, and then lifting all calorie restrictions. This timing and method of discontinuation mimics that of anticonvulsant drug therapy in children, where the child has become seizure free. When the diet is required to treat certain metabolic diseases, the duration will be longer. The total diet duration is up to the treating ketogenic diet team and parents; durations up to 12 years have been studied and found beneficial.|$|E

5|$|According to {{researcher}} Ibrahim Al-Khulaifi, {{there were}} three stages {{in the production of}} the show. The first stage was pre-production research, which identified basic education needs for {{children under the age of}} six. The second stage involved the creation of a pilot reel to test <b>children</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> show's effects and for review by educators, sociologists, psychologists, and other experts, who were invited to a seminar. Finally, the series was filmed and aired. Research began in August 1977; the team was led by an educator and included a linguist and a psychologist, all of whom were on the faculty of Kuwait University. The show was tested on different socioeconomic groups of children, between the ages of three and six, in kindergartens and preschools in four representative cities from Arab countries. The team proposed curriculum goals based upon the research and, during a seminar, Arab and CTW educators agreed on ten final goals.|$|E
5|$|Evangelis Zappas {{was often}} {{described}} as a solitary and eccentric personality, who had no <b>children.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, {{he was a man}} of vision, determination and a patriot, who was well aware of the magnitude of his acts. His cousin, Konstantinos Zappas, was the executor of his will and he continued Evangelis Zappas philanthropic works through his legacy. Zappas's wish was to be initially buried in Romania, where he lived most of his life. But after four years his bones were exhumed and reinterred at the school's courtyard in Labovo where he was born, and his skull was enshrined beneath his memorial statue outside the Zappeion in Athens, Greece. A ceremony for the interment was held at 10am on 20 October 1888 at the Zappeion. Baron Pierre de Coubertin made a similar gesture by having his heart buried at Olympia.|$|E
5|$|Interpretations of {{the figures}} varies. The twelve seated deities are taken to be the Olympians, they are one third taller than any other figure on the frieze and are {{arranged}} in two groups of six on diphroi (backless) stools, common forms of ancient furniture, {{with the exception of}} Zeus who is enthroned. Their backs are turned to what must be the culminating event of the procession E31–35; five figures (three children and two adults, and although badly corroded, the two <b>children</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left appear to be girls bearing objects on their heads, while a third, perhaps a boy, assisting an adult who may be the archon basileus, in folding a piece of cloth. This frieze often is interpreted as the presentation of Athena’s peplos, perhaps by the arrhephoroi, but debate exists regarding who the figures represent more than what ritual is represented.|$|E

5|$|Over time, the {{characterisation}} of Shashthi {{underwent a}} gradual evolution. Aforementioned folk traditions originating between the 10th and 5th centuries BCE associated the goddess with {{both positive and}} negative elements of fertility, birth, motherhood and childhood. However, between the 4th century BCE and the 5th century CE, a shift occurred in which Shashthi was increasingly depicted as a malevolent deity associated with the sufferings of mothers and children. The fifth century text Kashyapa Samhita calls Shashthi by the epithet Jataharini ("one who steals the born") and provides a list of the malevolent activities in which Shashthi is believed to engage, including her practice of stealing foetuses from the womb and devouring <b>children</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sixth day following birth. For this reason, the text recommends that she be propitiated through worship in her honour on this day in the lying-in room and on the sixth day of every fortnight thereafter.|$|E
5|$|The low {{glycaemic}} index treatment (LGIT) {{is an attempt}} to achieve the stable blood glucose levels seen in <b>children</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> classic ketogenic diet while using a much less restrictive regimen. The hypothesis is that stable blood glucose {{may be one of the}} mechanisms of action involved in the ketogenic diet, which occurs because the absorption of the limited carbohydrates is slowed by the high fat content. Although it is also a high-fat diet (with approximately 60% calories from fat), the LGIT allows more carbohydrate than either the classic ketogenic diet or the modified Atkins diet, approximately 40–60g per day. However, the types of carbohydrates consumed are restricted to those that have a {{glycaemic index}} lower than 50. Like the modified Atkins diet, the LGIT is initiated and maintained at outpatient clinics and does not require precise weighing of food or intensive dietitian support. Both are offered at most centres that run ketogenic diet programmes, and in some centres they are often the primary dietary therapy for adolescents.|$|E
5|$|The album's release {{coincided with}} Jarre's first foreign tour. In 1981 the British Embassy gave Radio Beijing copies of Oxygène and Équinoxe, {{which became the}} first pieces of foreign music to be played on Chinese {{national}} radio in decades. The republic invited Jarre {{to become the first}} western musician to play there, with Les Concerts en Chine. The performances were scheduled to run from 18 October to 5 November 1981. The first, in Beijing, was initially attended mostly by officials, but before the concert began technicians realised that not enough power was available to supply the stage and auditorium. Chinese officials solved the problem by temporarily cutting power to the surrounding districts. The stadium was almost full when the concert began, but as Beijing's buses stopped running at about 10 o'clock, about half the audience left before it finished. To boost the audience attendance for the second night, Jarre and his production team purchased some of the concert tickets and gave them to <b>children</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> streets (Jarre originally wanted the concerts to be free, but the Chinese authorities decided to charge between £0.20 and £0.50 per ticket). The event was notable for its lack of audience involvement; the Chinese were apparently unmoved by both the music and the light show, and applause was muted. The second venue, in Shanghai, was a different matter. Jarre actively encouraged audience participation by stepping into the crowd, which became much more exuberant than that in Beijing. Recordings of the concerts, which featured one of Jarre's signature electronic instruments, the laser harp, were released as a double-disc LP in 1982.|$|E
