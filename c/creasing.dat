5|$|For the game's {{character}} sculpting and rigging, {{the team}} introduced various new elements {{that were not}} used in their previous games. Lead character technical director Judd Simantov found {{that the creation of}} the faces was the most challenging, in terms of hardware. For the faces, the team used joint-based facial rigs, with some blend-shape correctives. To reta{{in the shape of the}} face and avoid awkward movement, the faces were rigged with the mouth open and eyes slightly closed. The faces were also based on the Facial Action Coding System, allowing for an anatomical-based approach. The use of a higher mesh density also allowed more volumes and <b>creasing</b> in the shape of the face, creating cleaner silhouettes and shapes and giving enough geometry to sculpt correctives. In an attempt to add subtle features, pupil dilation was added to the character models. For the bodies, the team edited the character movements from Uncharted 2, softening some joint alignment. The animation of carpal joints was also added for the game, allowing more dynamic hand shapes, and flexibility. Another subtle addition was the arm mover controls, allowing minor editing on the arms; though this feature was previously available, it was opened up to the animators for The Last of Us. A muscle system was also added, adding muscle shells that bulge, based on attachment joint distance; the muscle system, written in Maya within a few days, works in real time. To solve an issue in which body movement resulted in awkward movement of clothing, runtime helpers were implemented. A total of 326 joints were used in the full character model, with 98 of these in the face; 85 of these are runtime driven, while 241 are locked into animation.|$|E

They function as an undergarment which can be adjusted to bound tightly around the waist, hold and train a person’s waistline, so to slim and conform it to a fashionable silhouette. It also helped stop the bodice from horizontal <b>creasing.</b> With the corset, a very small tight fitting waist would be shown.|$|E

40|$|Ensuring {{uniformity}} in the nomenclature {{standardization of}} facial <b>creases</b> {{is important to}} enable the scholarly community to follow and debate the advancements in research. This review highlights the prevailing disparity in the nomenclature that refers to the same facial <b>crease</b> by researchers and laypeople, and suggests uniform names for the facial <b>creases</b> based on available literature. The previous and current trends in facial <b>crease</b> classification are also discussed. The nomenclature of the facial <b>creases</b> considered for this review include the following: the nasolabial fold, corner of the mouth lines, upper and lower lip <b>creases</b> around the mouth region, the mandibular folds, the bifid nose, the transverse nasal line, the vertical glabellar line, chin <b>crease,</b> the mental <b>crease,</b> four type of <b>creases</b> around the eyes, forehead <b>creases,</b> and periauricular <b>creases.</b> A figure illustrating the above facial <b>creases</b> is included as reference.

[...] In museum settings display times must be limited to prevent deterioration from exposure to light and environmental pollution. [...] Scrolling causes concavities in the paper, and the unrolling and rerolling of the scrolls causes <b>creasing.</b> [...] Ideal relative humidity for scrolls should be kept between 50% and 60%; brittleness results from too dry a level.|$|E
500|$|La Venta Monument4 {{measures}} [...] high by [...] {{wide and}} [...] deep. It weighs 19.8 tons. It was {{found a few}} metres {{to the west of}} Monument2 and has been moved to the Parque-Museo La Venta. As with the other heads in the group, its archaeological context has been radiocarbon dated to between 1000 and 600 BC. The headdress is elaborate and, although damaged, various details are still discernible. The base of the headdress is formed by three horizontal strips running over the forehead. One side is decorated with a double-disc motif that may have been repeated on the other; if so, damage to the right side has obliterated any trace of it. The top of the headdress is decorated with the clawed foot of a bird of prey. Either straps or plaits of hair descend {{on either side of the}} face, from the headdress to the base of the monument. Only one earspool survives; it is flat, in the form of a rounded square, and is decorated with a cross motif. The ears have been completely eroded away and the lips are damaged. The surviving features display a frown and <b>creasing</b> around the nose and cheeks. The head displays prominent teeth.|$|E

25|$|As {{illustrated}} above, {{the pitch}} is marked {{at each end}} with four white painted lines: a bowling <b>crease,</b> a popping <b>crease</b> and two return <b>creases.</b> The three stumps are aligned centrally on the bowling <b>crease,</b> which is eight feet eight inches long. The popping <b>crease</b> is drawn four {{feet in front of}} the bowling <b>crease</b> and parallel to it; although it is drawn as a twelve-foot line (six feet either side of the wicket), it is in fact unlimited in length. The return <b>creases</b> are drawn at right angles to the popping <b>crease</b> so that they intersect the ends of the bowling crease; each return <b>crease</b> is drawn as an eight-foot line, so that it extends four feet behind the bowling <b>crease,</b> but is also in fact unlimited in length.|$|R

40|$|Palm <b>creases</b> {{are helpful}} in {{revealing}} anthropologic characteristics and diagnosing chromosomal aberrations, {{and have been}} analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. However, previous methods of analyzing palm <b>creases</b> were not objective so that reproducibility could not be guaranteed. In this study, a more objective morphologic analysis of palm <b>creases</b> was developed. The features of the improved methods include the strict definition of major and minor palm <b>creases</b> and the systematic classification of major palm <b>creases</b> based on their relationships, branches, and variants. Furthermore, based on the analysis of 3, 216 Koreans, palm <b>creases</b> were anthropologically interpreted. There was a tendency for palm <b>creases</b> to be evenly distributed on the palm, which was acknowledged by the relationship between major and minor <b>creases</b> {{as well as by}} the incidences of major <b>creases</b> types. This tendency was consistent with the role of palm <b>creases</b> to facilitate folding of palm skin. The union of major palm <b>creases</b> was frequent in males and right palms to have powerful hand grip. The new method of analyzing palm <b>creases</b> is expected to be widely used for anthropologic investigation and chromosomal diagnosis...|$|R

Scottish-born Robert Gair invented the pre-cut paperboard box in 1890—flat pieces manufactured in bulk that folded into boxes. Gair's invention came about {{as a result of an}} accident: as a Brooklyn printer and paper-bag maker during the 1870s, he was once printing an order of seed bags, and the metal ruler, normally used to crease bags, shifted in position and cut them. Gair discovered that by cutting and <b>creasing</b> in one operation he could make prefabricated paperboard boxes.|$|E

Embalming was chosen to simulate the effects produced by post-mortem bloating. The results suggested that <b>creases</b> are resilient and changes were only detected for <b>creases</b> located {{on the periphery of the}} face, particularly at areas where the skin is thick, such as at the cheeks. Two new <b>creases</b> not previously classified were identified; these <b>creases</b> were called the vertical superciliary arch line and the lateral nose <b>crease.</b> This research suggests that facial <b>creases</b> may be resilient enough after death to be utilised for human identification...|$|R
