40|$|Abstract—There {{are many}} ways for {{detecting}} defects and classification and these methods have been applied to many areas of industry such as fabric or steel or etc. This paper proposes a method to <b>classify</b> <b>defects</b> of steel Bar In Coil (BIC) which has cylindrical shape. The wavelet transform {{has been used to}} detect or <b>classify</b> <b>defects</b> of images recently and the proposed classification algorithm uses wavelet transform to extract features of defect. The performance of classification using wavelet transform is closely related to the selection of the wavelet. A kind of standard wavelet is selected on the base of defect analysis and the selected wavelet decomposes the first order derivative of defects into wavelet function space according to the frequency. The wavelet transform is based on subband coding method and it separates frequency of input data. There are three defects which could affect the quality of BIC severely and each defect class has different frequency concentration. The proposed classification algorithm uses detail coefficients through one to three level 2 D wavelet transform as a feature of distinguishing each defect. The result shows 94. 8 % classification accuracy...|$|R

While the technology of CCTV has advanced, such as the enhancement on color image, articulating pan and tilt camera heads, the basic process and result have remained unchanged.

40|$|Today the {{inspection}} of specular surfaces, {{especially in the}} automobile sector, is often done by humans. An automated inspection would be preferable for reasons such as reproducibility, reliability, and objectivity. However it is problematic to replace humans by machines in this field. The main reasons for this are their greater flexibility {{for changes in the}} production process and their ability not only to find defects but to decide whether a customer would complain about those defects. With the deflectometric principle, there is a measurement method for specular surfaces that is fast and accurate enough to compete with humans. Open problems are the necessary expenses for the parameterization of the defect detection and the missing link to the human perception of defects. The first problem is addressed in this paper.

40|$|Although {{extended}} surface defects are {{often described as}} dislocations, they are less commonly associated with Burgers vectors. The concept of linear surface dislocations and their associated surface Burgers vectors is defined and discussed in an introductory way and the main properties are summarised. The definition of the Burgers vector differs from that used in the bulk, as a closed path integral is not used. The Burgers vector is a quantity which is conserved, modulo a surface unit vector, and which adds vectorially; and a surface dislocation must form either a closed loop on a surface, or else begin and terminate at a bulk dislocation. The utility {{of this approach is}} illustrated by considering a number of applications in real space, in particular imaging with topographic or diffraction contrast, where the concept allows a general means of <b>classifying</b> <b>defects.</b> In diffraction, the surface Burgers vector provides a convenient way of quantifying the effect of defects on peak profiles...|$|E

Therefore this study carries out to <b>classify</b> <b>defects</b> in textiles with minimum intervention of human being using artificial neural network technology and some principles of image processing techniques. My approach is to identify defects in textile comprises three steps, namely, image processing, image classification and producing the output as a classification chart. I have used the standard techniques of image processing; while the image classification is handled by an ANN trained in the supervised mode with the aid of back propagation training algorithm. I have selected three major defect types of defects from textile quality process. They are cut hole damages, open seam of the garment and pen marks. Input data is a 185220 x 30 matrix and it is representing 30 samples of 185220 elements. The output of the system will be an image file with a defect classification chart. In fact, basically this system is able to <b>classify</b> <b>defects</b> in to three categories. This system mainly is divided in to three sections namely; image processing module, neural network module and output generator module. But the system design is separated in to two parts.

40|$|Defect {{measurement}} plays {{a crucial}} role when assessing quality assurance processes such as inspections and testing. To systematically combine these processes {{in the context of an}} integrated quality assurance strategy, measurement must provide empirical evidence on how effective these processes are and which types of defects are detected by which quality assurance process. Typically, defect classification schemes, such as ODC or the Hewlett-Packard scheme, are used to measure defects for this purpose. However, we found it difficult to transfer existing schemes to an embedded software context, where specific document- and defect types have to be considered. This paper presents an approach to define, introduce, and validate a customized defect classification scheme that considers the specifics of an industrial environment. The core of the approach is to combine the software engineering know-how of meas-urement experts and the domain know-how of developers. In addition to the approach, we present the results and experiences of using the approach in an industrial setting.

40|$|The {{current level}} of demand by {{customers}} in the electronics industry requires the production of parts with an extremely high level of reliability and quality to ensure complete confidence on the end customer. Automatic Optical Inspection (AOI) machines {{have an important role}} in the monitoring and detection of errors during the manufacturing process for printed circuit boards. These machines present images of products with probable assembly mistakes to an operator and him decide whether the product has a real defect or if in turn this was an automated false detection. Operator training is an important aspect for obtaining a lower rate of evaluation failure by the operator and consequently a lower rate of actual defects that slip through to the following processes. The Gage R&R methodology for attributes is part of a Six Sigma strategy to examine the repeatability and reproducibility of an evaluation system, thus giving important feedback on the suitability of each operator in <b>classifying</b> <b>defects.</b> This methodology was already applied in several industry sectors and services at different processes, with excellent results in the evaluation of subjective parameters. An application for training operators of AOI machines was developed, in order to be able to check their fitness and improve future evaluation performance. This application will provide a better understanding of the specific training needs for each operator, and also to accompany the evolution of the training program for new components which in turn present additional new difficulties for the operator evaluation. The use of this application will contribute to reduce the number of defects misclassified by the operators that are passed on to the following steps in the productive process. This defect reduction will also contribute to the continuous improvement of the operator evaluation performance, which is seen as a quality management goal...|$|E
