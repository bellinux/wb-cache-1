50|$|The {{original}} {{concept design}} by architects Khatib & Alami was 74 floors, with three basement levels and a four-storey podium, {{and had a}} total planned built up area of 111,832 m² (1.2 million ft²). It was to have 504 apartments ranging from one to three bedrooms and four duplex apartment suites. The three basement floors {{and part of the}} podium were to hold car parking for 536 vehicles, while floors five and six were to contain a swimming pool, health club, gymnasium, cafeteria, aerobic rooms and sit-out <b>cover</b> <b>seal</b> terraces.|$|E
50|$|Columbia was {{rolled out}} to Pad A {{for the second}} time 9 August to support a 1 September launch date. Two days before launch, the {{avionics}} box on the BBXRT portion of the ASTRO-1 payload malfunctioned and had to be changed and retested. Launch was rescheduled for 6 September. During tanking, high concentrations of hydrogen were again detected in the orbiter's aft compartment, forcing another postponement. NASA managers concluded that Columbia had experienced separate hydrogen leaks from the beginning: one of the umbilical assembly (now replaced) and one or more which had resurfaced in the aft compartment. Suspicion focused on the package of three hydrogen recirculation pumps in the aft compartment. These were replaced and retested. A damaged Teflon <b>cover</b> <b>seal</b> in the main engine number three hydrogen prevalve was replaced. Launch was rescheduled for 18 September. The fuel leak in the aft compartment resurfaced during tanking, and the launch was scrubbed again. The STS-35 mission was put on hold until problem resolved by a special tiger team assigned by the Space Shuttle director.|$|E

40|$|The aft {{region of}} the Galileo probe will be {{subjected}} to severe heat transfer rates dominated by the radiation contributions. To assess the response of several vehicle aft region components to thermal radiation, tests employing a 10 KW CO 2 laser were conducted. The experiments evaluated the annulus/aft cover interface, the umbilical feedthrough assembly and the mortar <b>cover</b> <b>seal</b> assembly. Experimental evidence of {{the response of the}} phenolic nylon heatshield and quantitative measures of its effect on gap geometries of several vehicle components were acquired. In addition, qualitative measures of the survivability of the irradiated components were obtained...|$|E
40|$|Techniques for {{studying}} the performance of Naflex pressure-assisted seals in the Ares-I Upper Stage liquid hydrogen tank manhole <b>cover</b> <b>seal</b> joint are explored. To assess the feasibility of using the identical seal design for the Upper Stage as {{was used for the}} Space Shuttle External Tank manhole covers, a preliminary seal deflection analysis using the ABAQUS commercial finite element software is employed. The ABAQUS analyses are performed using three-dimensional symmetric wedge finite element models. This analysis technique is validated by first modeling a heritage External Tank liquid hydrogen tank manhole cover joint and correlating the results to heritage test data. Once the technique is validated, the Upper Stage configuration is modeled. The Upper Stage analyses are performed at 1. 4 times the expected pressure to comply with the Constellation Program factor of safety requirement on joint separation. Results from the analyses performed with the External Tank and Upper Stage models demonstrate the effects of several modeling assumptions on the seal deflection. The analyses for Upper Stage show that the integrity of the seal is successfully maintained...|$|E

40|$|We {{quantified}} {{the winter}} and spring movement patterns and foraging behavior of adult crabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophagus), {{and the influence of}} sea ice and bathymetry on their foraging behavior. Thirty-four seals (16 M 18 F) were outfitted with Satellite Relay Data Loggers (SRDLs) in the Marguerite Bay Region of the Antarctic Peninsula (671 S, 671 W) during the austral winters of 2001 and 2002. Tags transmitted position and dive information for between 4 and 174 days. Overall, winter activity patterns differed significantly from previously reported data collected during the summer: seals in this study dived deeper (9270. 2 m, range 6 – 713 m) and longer (5. 26 min 70. 6, range 0. 2 – 23. 6 min), hauled out during the night rather than the day, and showed seasonal shifts in foraging patterns consistent with foraging on vertically migrating prey. While these patterns were more pronounced in 2001 than in 2002, there were no strong differences in patterns of habitat use between the 2 years. Some animals made long distance movements (furthest movements 664 km to northeast, 1147 km to southwest), but most seals remained within 300 km of their tagging location. Within the Marguerite Bay/Crystal Sound region, seals appeared to favor foraging locations on the continental shelf within the 50 to 450 m depth range, with a tendency to avoid depths of 600 m or greater. In both years, seals remained deep within the pack ice throughout the winter, and did not move into regions with less ice <b>cover.</b> <b>Seal...</b>|$|E

50|$|Oil leakage was {{commonplace in}} {{the first few years of}} production, though the problem was {{eventually}} addressed by aftermarket cam cover gaskets made from reusable rubber. Later 900 series Lotus engines included a revised cam tower that greatly improved the cam <b>cover</b> <b>sealing</b> design. The later cam towers can be retrofitted to the earlier 907 engines. Early Jensen-Healey engines (1972-1973) had oil supply issues that made the oil pressure slow to build on start-up. Some early engines also had issues with oil drainage which resulted in too much oil being retained in the cam carriers. Differences between early and late 907 engines included rope seals for the rear of the crankshaft versus regular spring-loaded rubber lip seals for the rear of the crankshaft on later 907 engines.|$|R
