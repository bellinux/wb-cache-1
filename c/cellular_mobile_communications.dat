During his 17 years at NEC's Central Research Laboratories he designed early pulse-code modulation equipment down to the coding and decoding circuitry. During his two years at COMSAT, he set up a communications processing laboratory and oversaw or helped oversee numerous projects covering voice-, data-, and video-processing technologies, including the development of single-channel-per-carrier pulse-code-modulation multiple-access demand-assignment equipment and assigned it the acronym SPADE because [...] "the ace of the spades in card games was regarded as almighty". Later, in the early 1970s, Intelsat commercialized SPADE technology, which is credited with allowing developing countries to join global networks by making satellite communications affordable to them. A time-division multiple access (TDMA) system and an automatic routing system Sekimoto developed were not only hugely significant for satellite communications, but also became indispensable elements of <b>cellular</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>communications</b> thirty years on. Seminal in their day, many technologies and applications Sekimoto worked on at NEC and COMSAT are integral to modern telecommunications systems, and they helped lay the groundwork for the global networks that many societies now depend on.|$|E

We examine the radius of inner zone and discuss the capacity of downlink crossed slots for various neighbor cell environments. Computational results show that the capacity increase in the target cell is outstanding by reducing the service range of neighbor cells. When all six neighbors reduce their service range by 20 %, the capacity at target cell crossed slot is increased by 35 %.

However, the weight selection is a critical task to get the low Side Lobe Level (SLL) and Low Beam Width. It needs to have a low SLL and low beam width to reduce the antenna's radiation/reception ability in unintended directions. The weights can be chosen to minimize the SLL and to place nulls at certain angles. A vast number of possible window functions that are available to provide the weights to be used in Smart Antennas.
