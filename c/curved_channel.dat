40|$|Abstract. We {{studied the}} effect of {{geometry}} on single focusing of particles in the passive microfluidic channels. There is a quantitative analysis of focusing on non-axisymmetric straight channels with two different unique designs as well as <b>curved</b> <b>channels</b> having symmetrical and asymmetrical radius of curvatures in one turn. We found {{that there is a}} clear relationship in existence of single line focusing with the degree of non-symmetry in microchannels. One-degree of asymmetry in straight channels does not induce any formation of single focusing, but single line focusing is pronounced by two-degree of asymmetry in straight channels. On the other hand, single line focusing in the <b>curved</b> <b>channels</b> is enhanced with asymmetrical radius of curvatures in one turn. The single line focusing in <b>curved</b> <b>channels</b> is seen at Rep values higher than 1, which gives us better continuous and high-throughput performance. The position of single focused particles in the microchannels is found to be 50 µm with respect to the channel wall in the asymmetrical curved microchannels...|$|R

40|$|Inertial {{focusing}} is {{the migration}} of particles in fluid toward equilibrium, where current theory predicts that shear-induced and wall-induced lift forces are balanced. First reported in 1961, this Segre-Silberberg effect is particularly useful for microfluidic isolation of cells and particles. Interestingly, recent work demonstrated particle focusing at high Reynolds numbers that cannot be explained by current theory. In this work, we show that non-monotonous velocity profiles, such as those developed in <b>curved</b> <b>channels,</b> create peripheral velocity maxima around which opposing shear-induced forces dominate over wall effects. Similarly, entry effects amplified in high Reynolds flow produce an equivalent trapping mechanism in short, straight channels. This new focusing mechanism in the developing flow regime enables a 10 -fold miniaturization of inertial focusing devices, while our model corrects long-standing misconceptions {{about the nature of}} mechanical forces governing inertial focusing in <b>curved</b> <b>channels.</b> Comment: 12 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

The purpose-built, variable slope, 8 m long flume enables a variety of debris flow boundary conditions to be studied.

50|$|Glaciers erode {{predominantly}} {{by three}} different processes: abrasion/scouring, plucking, and ice thrusting. In an abrasion process, debris in the basal ice scrapes along the bed, polishing and gouging the underlying rocks, similar to sandpaper on wood. Scientists have shown that, {{in addition to}} the role of temperature played in valley-deepening, other glaciological processes, such as erosion also control cross-valley variations. In a homogeneous bedrock erosion pattern, <b>curved</b> <b>channel</b> cross section beneath the ice is created. Though the glacier continues to incise vertically, the shape of the channel beneath the ice eventually remain constant, reaching a U-shaped parabolic steady-state shape as we now see in glaciated valleys. Scientists also provide numerical estimate of the time required for the ultimate formation of a steady-shaped U-shaped valley - approximately 100,000 years. In a weak bedrock (containing material more erodible than the surrounding rocks) erosion pattern, on the contrary, the amount of overdeepening is limited because ice velocities and erosion rates are reduced.|$|E

Computational Fluid Dynamics is used to model the flow in downstream of the dam and in the <b>curved</b> <b>channel</b> which is exactly located after the bottom outlet. The full Navier- Stokes equations are solved under steady conditions with the commercial software ANSYS CFX 12. 1.

40|$|The {{detonation}} propagation {{phenomena in}} curved channels were experimentally studied {{in order to}} determine the stable propagation condition. A stoichiometric ethylene–oxygen mixture gas and five types of rectangular-cross-section curved channels with different inner radii of curvature were employed. The detonation waves propagating through the curved channels were visualized using a high-speed video camera. Multi-frame short-time open-shutter photography (MSOP) was developed in the present study to simultaneously observe the front shock shape of the detonation wave and the trajectories of triple points on the detonation wave. The detonation wave became more stable under the conditions of a higher filling pressure of the mixture gas and/or a larger inner radius of curvature of the <b>curved</b> <b>channel.</b> The critical condition under which the propagation mode of the detonation wave transitioned from unstable to stable was having an inner radius of curvature of the <b>curved</b> <b>channel</b> (ri) equivalent to 21 – 32 times the normal detonation cell width (λ). In the stable propagation mode, the normal detonation velocity (Dn) increased with the distance from the inner wall of the <b>curved</b> <b>channel</b> and approached the velocity of the planar detonation propagating through the straight section of the <b>curved</b> <b>channel</b> (Dstr). The smallest Dn was observed on the inner wall and decreased with decreasing ri/λ. The distribution of Dn on the detonation wave in the stable mode was approximately formulated. The approximated Dn given by the formula agreed well with the experimental results. The front shock shape of the detonation wave could be reconstructed accurately using the formula. The local curvature of the detonation wave (κ) nondimensionalized by λ decreased with increasing distance from the inner wall. The largest λκ was observed on the inner wall and increased with increasing ri/λ. Dn/Dstr decreased with increasing λκ. This nondimensionalized Dn–κ relation was nearly independent of ri/λ...|$|E
