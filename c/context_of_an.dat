5|$|For ischaemic heart disease, {{treatment}} {{also includes}} amelioration of symptoms. This includes nitroglycerin, beta blockers and, in the <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> acute event, stronger pain relief such as morphine and other opiates. Many {{of these drugs}} have additional protective benefits, by decreasing the sympathetic tone on the heart that occurs with the pain, or by dilating blood vessels (GTN).|$|E

5|$|After the bloodless coup d'état of 1969 {{that saw}} Mohamed Siad Barre's {{ascension}} to power, {{the government in}} 1971 nationalized the four foreign banks. The government combined Banco di Roma, Banco di Napoli, and National and Grindlays Bank to form the Somali Commercial Bank. The government also established the Somali Savings and Credit Bank {{to take over the}} commercial branches of Banca Nazionale Somala and Banque de Port Said, leaving the Banca Nazionale Somala with only central banking functions. The Somali Savings and Credit Bank had branches in Baidoa, Beledweyne, Berbera, Bosaso, Burco, Galkacyo, Qardho, Hargeisa and Kismayo, and for a while in Djibouti. The Somali Savings and Credit Bank had been established with the technical assistance and aid provided by the Associazione Bancaria Italiana in the <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> overall cooperation policy of the European savings banks.|$|E
5|$|Peter Hervik {{said that}} the cartoon {{controversy}} must {{be seen in the}} <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> increasingly politicised media environment in Denmark since the 1990s, increasingly negative coverage of Islam and the Muslim minority in Denmark, anti-Muslim rhetoric from the governing political parties, and government policies such as restrictions on immigration and the abolishment of the Board for Ethnic Equality in 2002. Hervik said these themes are often ignored in international coverage of the issue and that they render conclusions that Jyllands-Posten and the Danish government were innocent victims in a dispute over freedom of speech inaccurate. Against this background, Danish Muslims were particularly offended by the cartoons because they reinforced the idea that Danes stigmatize all Muslims as terrorists and do not respect their religious beliefs.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} ancient Egyptian civilization came partly from {{its ability to}} adapt to the {{conditions}} of the Nile River valley for agriculture. The predictable flooding and controlled irrigation of the fertile valley produced surplus crops, which supported a more dense population, and social development and culture. With resources to spare, the administration sponsored mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions, the early development of an independent writing system, the organization of collective construction and agricultural projects, trade with surrounding regions, and a military intended to defeat foreign enemies and assert Egyptian dominance. Motivating and organizing these activities was a bureaucracy of elite scribes, religious leaders, and administrators under the control of a pharaoh, who ensured the cooperation and unity of the Egyptian people in the <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> elaborate system of religious beliefs.|$|E

5|$|Major {{developments}} in 19th-century Welsh literature include Lady Charlotte Guest's {{translation of the}} Mabinogion, {{one of the most}} important medieval Welsh prose tales of Celtic mythology, into English. 1885 saw the publication of Rhys Lewis by Daniel Owen, credited as the first novel written in the Welsh language. The 20th century experienced an important shift away from the stilted and long-winded Victorian Welsh prose, with Thomas Gwynn Jones leading the way with his 1902 work Ymadawiad Arthur. The slaughter in the trenches of the First World War had a profound effect on Welsh literature with a more pessimistic style of prose championed by T. H. Parry-Williams and R. Williams Parry. The industrialisation of south Wales saw a further shift with the likes of Rhydwen Williams who used the poetry and metre of a bygone rural Wales but in the <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> industrial landscape. Though the inter-war period is dominated by Saunders Lewis, for his political and reactionary views as much as his plays, poetry and criticism.|$|E

40|$|Determining the <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> feature (i. e., {{the factors}} {{affecting}} the ranking <b>of</b> <b>a</b> feature within a case) has been subject of several studies in analysis tasks, particularly for classification {{but not in}} synthesis tasks like planning.

We provide <b>a</b> characterization <b>of</b> the domain theory and show that in domains meeting this characterization, the context can be simplified. We also use explanation-based learning techniques to determine the context in domains not meeting the characterization.
