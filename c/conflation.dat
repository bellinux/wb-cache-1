5|$|Herennianus and Timolaus: the {{two were}} {{mentioned}} in the Augustan History and are not attested in any other source; Herennianus might be a <b>conflation</b> of Hairan and Herodianus while Timolaus is most probably a fabrication, although Dietmar Kienast suggest {{that he might be}} Vaballathus.|$|E
5|$|The opera was {{frequently}} revised, most particularly in 1717 and in 1731; modern performances are usually a <b>conflation</b> of the versions available. Up {{to and including}} 1717, these changes had no {{significant effect on the}} plot. In the 1731 version, however, in Act 2 Armida imitates Almirena's voice rather than assuming her appearance, and Argante declares his love to Almirena's portrait rather than to her face. In Act 3 the marches and the battle scene are cut; Armida and Argante remain unrepentant and vanish in a chariot drawn by dragons before the conclusion.|$|E
5|$|In the Augustan History, Zenobia {{is said to}} {{have been}} a {{descendant}} of Cleopatra and claimed descent from the Ptolemies. According to the Souda, a 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia, after the Palmyrene conquest of Egypt, the Greek sophist Callinicus of Petra wrote a ten-volume history of Alexandria dedicated to Cleopatra. According to modern scholars, by Cleopatra Callinicus meant Zenobia. Apart from legend, there is no evidence in Egyptian coinage or papyri of a contemporary <b>conflation</b> of Zenobia with Cleopatra; it may have been invented by Zenobia's enemies to discredit her. Zenobia's alleged claim of a connection to Cleopatra seems to have been politically motivated, since it would have given her a connection with Egypt and made her a legitimate successor to the Ptolemies' throne. A relationship between Zenobia and the Ptolemies is unlikely, and attempts by classical sources to trace the queen's ancestry to the Ptolemies through the Seleucids are apocryphal.|$|E

40|$|We give a {{classification}} of all exact structures {{on a given}} idempotent complete additive category. Using this, we investigate the structure of an exact category with finitely many indecomposables. We show that {{the relation of the}} Grothendieck group of such a category is generated by AR <b>conflations.</b> Moreover, we obtain an explicit classification of (1) Gorenstein-projective-finite Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebras, (2) Cohen-Macaulay-finite orders, and more generally, (3) cotilting modules U with ^ U of finite type. In the appendix, we develop the AR theory of exact categories over a noetherian complete local ring, and relate the existence of AR <b>conflations</b> to the AR duality and dualizing varieties.

5|$|The name Eboracum {{became the}} Anglian Eoforwic in the 7thcentury: a {{compound}} of Eofor-, from the old name, and -wic a village probably by <b>conflation</b> of the element Ebor- with a Germanic root *eburaz (boar); by the 7thcentury the Old English for 'boar' had become eofor. Alternatively, the word eofor already existed as an Old English word for wild swine, which is a cognate of the current Low Saxon word eaver and Dutch ever. The Anglo-Saxon newcomers probably interpreted the ebor part as eofor, and -rac as ric (meaning rich), while -um was (and is) a common abbreviation of the Saxon -heem, meaning home. To them, it sounded as a 'home rich in boar'. As is common in Saxon place names, the -um part gradually faded; eoforic. When the Danish army conquered the city in 866, its name became Jórvík.|$|E
5|$|Gil met guitarist {{and singer}} Caetano Veloso at the Universidade Federal da Bahia (Federal University of Bahia) in 1963. The two {{immediately}} began collaborating and performing together, releasing a single and EP soon afterwards. Along with Maria Bethânia (Veloso's sister), Gal Costa, and Tom Zé, Gil and Veloso performed bossa nova and traditional Brazilian songs at the Vila Velha Theatre's opening night in July 1964, a show entitled Nós, por Exemplo (Us, for Example). Gil {{and the group}} continued to perform at the venue and he eventually became a musical director of the concert series. Gil collaborated again with members of this collective on the landmark 1968 album , whose style was influenced by The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, an album Gil listened to constantly. Gil describes Tropicália: ou Panis et Circenses as {{the birth of the}} tropicália movement. As Gil describes it, tropicália (or Tropicalismo) was a <b>conflation</b> of musical and cultural developments that had occurred in Brazil during the 1950s and 1960s—primarily bossa nova and the Jovem Guarda (Young Wave) collective—with rock and roll music from the United States and Europe, a movement deemed threatening by the Brazilian government of the time.|$|E

40|$|Which {{words do}} {{children}} learn earliest, and why? These questions bear on how humans organize {{the world into}} semantic concepts, and how children acquire this parsing. A useful perspective is to think of how bits of experience are conflated into the same concept. One possibility is that children are born with the set of conceptual <b>conflations</b> that figures in human language. But assuming (as we will) that most semantic concepts are learned, not innate, there remain two possibilities. First, aspects of perceptual experience could form inevitable <b>conflations</b> that are conceptualized and lexicalized as unified concepts. In this case, we would have cognitive dominance: concepts arise from the cognitive-perceptual sphere and are simply named by language. A second possibility is linguistic dominance: the world presents perceptual bits whose clumping is not pre-ordained, and language has a say in how the bits get conflated into concepts. We propose that both cognitive and linguistic dominance apply, but to different degrees for different kinds of words (Gentner 1981, 1982). Som...|$|R
