40|$|<b>Common</b> <b>pandora</b> (Pagellus erythrinus) is a benthopelagic marine fish {{belonging}} to the teleost family Sparidae, and a newly recruited species in Mediterranean aquaculture. The paucity of genetic information relating to sparids, despite their growing economic value for aquaculture, provides the impetus for exploring the genomics of this fish group. Genomic tool development, such as genetic linkage maps provision, lays the groundwork for linking genotype to phenotype, allowing fine-mapping of loci responsible for beneficial traits. In this study, we applied ddRAD methodology to identify polymorphic markers in a full-sib family of <b>common</b> <b>pandora.</b> Employing the Illumina MiSeq platform, we sampled and sequenced a size-selected genomic fraction of 99 individuals, {{which led to the}} identification of 920 polymorphic loci. Downstream mapping analysis resulted in the construction of 24 robust linkage groups, corresponding to the karyotype of the species. The <b>common</b> <b>pandora</b> linkage map showed varying degrees of conserved synteny with four other teleost genomes, namely the European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax), Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), and medaka (Oryzias latipes), suggesting a conserved genomic evolution in Sparidae. Our work exploits the possibilities of genotyping by sequencing to gain novel insights into genome structure and evolution.

40|$|International audienceThe {{relationship}} between heterozygosity and age, {{as well as}} growth-related traits, was explored in the <b>common</b> <b>pandora</b> Pagellus erythrinus, a sparid fish subjected to commercial exploitation in the Mediterranean Sea. Allozyme electrophoresis was used to quantify the levels of heterozygosity of 238 adult fish from 3 to 7 yr old, aged by means of otoliths and captured in the Gabes Gulf, located along the south-eastern coast of Tunisia. Analyses were conducted by using individual single-locus and multi-locus heterozygosity and 4 growth-related parameters-standard length, total body weight, otolith length and otolith weight-as well as 2 measures of condition (condition factor and relative condition factor). For the 4 growth-related parameters and 2 condition parameters analyzed at 8 polymorphic loci, heterozygotes had higher average values than homozygotes in 36 out of 48 comparisons. However, since these 6 biometric parameters are highly correlated, this proportion {{should not be considered}} globally as strong evidence of a heterozygosity-fitness correlation (HFC). Interpreting these data on a per parameter basis, only otolith weight appeared significantly and positively correlated with multi-locus heterozygosity. Thus, although there was evidence for HFC, it appeared relatively weak for the growth para meters analyzed and may have arisen by chance. The results we obtained relative to survival are more convincing. Although cohorts did not appear genetically differentiated and the whole sample did not display any internal structure after a Bayesian analysis with the STRUCTURE software, multi-locus individual heterozygosity was significantly and positively correlated with fish age.

In spite that in the Mediterranean area only few marine species (sea bass and sea bream) cover the 92. 4 % of the market, an increased biodiversity in the production would improve the nutritional quality, as well as the resource for the market and the possibility to better exploit natural resources. This research work is focused on the evaluation of biological and physiological functions of new species, such as rabbitfish (Siganus rivulatus) and <b>common</b> <b>pandora</b> (Pagellus erythrinus), in respect to their capacity for aquaculture production. Morphometric measurements on wild rabbitfish revealed that the TL-TW relationship is described by the equation y= 0. 068 x+ 11. 044. Condition factor (K) was 1. 65 ± 0. 17, HSI was 1. 4 ± 0. 4 and GSI was found to reach maximum values near the full moon during summer months. Respirometry on individual cultured rabbitfish was measured at 17, 20, 23 and 26 °C. Oxygen consumption rate increased with water temperature and it was varied between 2. 4 × 10 - 3 mg O 2 /g BW/min at 17 °C and 1. 1 × 10 - 2 mg O 2 /g BW/min at 26 °C.

40|$|Formation of {{brood stock}} is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most important operations in order to acquire eggs and fry from any promising candidate finfish species for aquaculture production. The sex reversal observed in hermaphrodite species adds to confusion and creates additional complications in forming a brood stock. The present study describes the efforts and the results of the brood stock formation of the hermaphrodite finfish species Pagellus erythrinus (<b>common</b> <b>Pandora)</b> from individuals aged between 4 and 5 years (TL> 300 mm) reared in floating cages. Six groups were formed (50 fish/group) in all of which females were present comprising 20 to 40 % of the population. The presence of females was in contrast to the literature, which reported that sex reversal of the <b>common</b> <b>Pandora</b> is complete in naturally occurring populations with the absence of females in sizes of a total length greater than 220 mm, indicating that in captivity sex reversal is not complete for this species. Four of the groups formed spawned under natural environmental conditions without hormonal treatment and the other two groups were administered a different dosage (250 and 500 IU/kg) of Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) to induce spawning. The reproductive period started in the middle of May and ended at the beginning of July and spontaneous spawning occurred in all groups. Egg release lasted for a mean period of one month for the groups that spawned without hormonal treatment with no significant difference in the number of viable eggs between groups. The groups that spawned under hormonal treatment released eggs for a period of six and seven days, for the group that spawned under the high and low hormonal treatment, respectively, with no significant difference in the number of viable eggs between them. The hormonal induced spawning resulted in egg release within a short period of time ideal for a hatchery.

40|$|ABSTRACT In {{the last}} decades, recent {{molecular}} approaches have lead to {{fundamental changes in}} our understanding of marine population ecology. The classical notion that marine environments tend to be demographically ‘open’, with high connectivity among populations of infinite size and generally characterized by low genetic differentiation (Hauser and Carvalho, 2008) is quite abandoned. In fact, recent genetic studies have challenged such traditional view, by demonstrating genetic structuring in marine fish species, even on a limited spatial scale (Knutsen et al., 2003; Jørgensen et al., 2005; Knutsen et al., 2007). Moreover, {{it became clear that the}} degree of dispersion and the extent of gene flow among marine populations are strongly influenced by oceanographic discontinuities (transition areas that could determine phylogeographic discontinuities) suggesting that the picture is much more complex than previously assumed (Schunter et al., 2011). In this context, we investigated the distribution of genetic and morphological variability of Pagellus erythrinus (<b>common</b> <b>pandora),</b> one of the main target species in Mediterranean commercial fisheries and whose knowledge on biological features is still limited. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the degree of genetic structure of <b>common</b> <b>pandora,</b> necessary for a correct management of this resource and, to increase knowledge of the genetic variability distribution patterns in the Sparidae family and, more generally, in Mediterranean demersal species. The morphological analysis aims to investigate the degree of morphological differentiationon a geographical basis, and its possible concordance/correlation with genetic variability. Specimens were collected from 16 localities along the Italian (13 sites) and the Tunisian coasts (2 sites), in the central Mediterranean Sea, and from one location in the Atlantic Ocean, along the southern coast of Portugal. Genetic analyses were carried out using three different molecular markers: two mitochondrial DNA markers, control region (CR, sequence analysis) and cytochrome b (Cyt b RFLP analysis) and a nuclear one, microsatellites (10 loci). We identified three different mitochondrial lineageseach including individuals from almost every sampling sites, without a geographic pattern. Nevertheless, different, and statistically significant, frequency distribution was found for two of the these lineages between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The presence of these long-diverged lineages, that now can be found in sympatry, is attributable to a period of isolation followed by secondary contact. These events, likely due to climatic fluctuations of the Pleistocene, left decipherable genetic footprints on phylogeographic and demographic facets of <b>common</b> <b>pandora</b> history. Microsatellites showed that present-day dynamics produces a weak but significant genetic structure (Fst= 0. 006, p < 0. 05) among the examined localities. One Atlantic and four Mediterranean subpopulations were identified, which might be explained by the major oceanographic discontinuities and local currents described in the investigated area. A certain degree of differentiation was observed for some localities within the Mediterranean Sea (North Elba and along the Tunisian coasts) for which phylogeographic breaks have not been reported so far. Further studies will be necessary to better understand dispersal components in relation both to local oceanographic conditions and adults mobility. Data obtained with the two types of molecular markers allow us to assert that the species in the past has been affected by processes of isolation, and, consequently, genetic divergence of populations followed bysecondary contact, Under present day conditions, populations are characterized by high connectivity and dispersal is limited only in some restricted areas. Morphological analysis was carried out by a geometric morphometrics approach, through the detection of 20 landmarks. The analysis revealed morphological variations in size and shape components, both between sexes and sites. The variability in size could be due to different local environmental features and to the hermaphroditism of the species. Differences in shape could be related to a slight sexual dimorphism. Statistical tests revealed absence of correlation between morphological and genetic patterns indicating that phenotypic plasticity and adaptive divergence/convergence are potential mechanisms underlying morphological differences detected among P. erythrinus...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} long-term {{changes in}} the Mediterranean marine resources driving the trawl fisheries by analysing fishers ’ perceptions (Traditional Ecological Knowledge, TEK) throughout the Mediterranean Sea during the last 80 years. To this end, we conducted an extended set of interviews with experienced fishers that enabled us to classify species (or taxa) as ‘decreasing ’ or ‘increasing ’ {{both in terms of}} abundance, as well as average size in the catch. The aspect that most clearly emerged in all the investigated areas over time was the notable increase of fishing capacity indicators, such as engine power and fishing depth range.

40|$|The mean {{trophic level}} of the farmed fish species in the Mediterranean has been increasing.

40|$|The {{ecological}} role {{of species}} can vary among populations depending on {{local and regional}} differences in diet.

Here, we combined stomach content analyses (SCA) and stable isotope analyses (SIA) to describe bottlenose dolphins diet in the Gulf of Cadiz (North Atlantic Ocean). Prey items identified using SCA included European conger (Conger conger) and European hake (Merluccius merluccius) as the most important ingested prey. However, mass-balance isotopic mixing model (MixSIAR), using δ 13 C and δ 15 N, indicated that the assimilated diet consisted mainly on Sparidae species (e. g. seabream, Diplodus annularis and D. bellottii, rubberlip grunt, Plectorhinchus mediterraneus, and <b>common</b> <b>pandora,</b> Pagellus erythrinus) and a mixture of other species including European hake, mackerels (Scomber colias, S. japonicus and S. scombrus), European conger, red bandfish (Cepola macrophthalma) and European pilchard (Sardina pilchardus). These contrasting results highlight differences in the temporal and taxonomic resolution of each approach, but also point to potential differences between ingested (SCA) and assimilated (SIA) diets.

40|$|The {{demersal}} trawl fishery of {{the north}} Tunisian coast primarily targets the deep-water rose shrimp, Parapenaeus longirostris, and secondarily a variety of demersal fish species. These fishes include hake (Merluccius merluccius), <b>common</b> <b>pandora</b> (Pagellus erythrinus), red mullet (Mullus barbatus), surmullet (Mullus surmuletus), Atlantic horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus), bogue (Boops boops), picarel (Spicara smaris) and spotted flounder (Citharus linguatula). A bioeconomic model {{was used to test}} management measures through scenarios that ran over eleven years to estimate the viability of the fishery according to biological and economic results. The most beneficial scenario was the combination of several management measures including a temporal closure of two months, the replacement of the 40 mm diamond mesh codend with 40 mm square mesh, the removal of both the biological recovery tax and of fuel subsidies, and an 83 % reduction in fishing capacity. This results in an annual private profit higher by 9. 3 M TND (Tunisian Dinar) (6. 9 M USD) that of 2008, and an economic rent that was higher by 13. 3 M TND (9. 9 M USD) than {{by the end of the}} projected period.

30|$|During {{the first}} 96  hph the TL {{increased}} significantly (P <  0.05) {{compared to the}} next 144  h, whereas at the same time, the yolk sac volume was reduced significantly (P <  0.05) due to their absorption. Conversely, {{the volume of the}} oil globule was not intensely absorbed. The oil globule consumption during the yolk-sac stage of the silver perch seems lower than the marine species <b>common</b> <b>pandora,</b> Pagellus erythrinus, reared at comparable temperature at 18 – 21  °C (Klimogianni 2004). A probable cause is a delay in oil globule adherence to the larval body (Klimogianni et al. 2011), which occurred mostly at 120 – 240  hph (Fig.  2). This is much later compared to another marine species, the sharp snout sea bream, Diplodus puntazzo, which occurred at 4 – 6  hph. This could be advantageous to silver perch larvae as they get the opportunity to utilize both endogenous yolk and exogenous food (termed as the ‘mixed feeding period’) (Chai et al. 2011) for a longer time (6  days). This is much longer than the Chinese sturgeon, Acipenser sinensis, whose mixed feeding period only lasts for 2  days (Chai et al. 2011). Larvae have to start their capability to feed on an exogenous diet during the time when both endogenous and exogenous sources of diet are available; if not, they will hurt from continuous food shortage (Blaxter and Hempel 1963). An extended period of the mixed-feeding time is advantageous for larvae to gather enough feeding skills to develop their exogenous feeding capability, to escape from food shortages, and hence increase their probability of survival rates.|$|E
40|$|Questions {{should be}} {{addressed}} to Joan Giménez (joan. gimenez@csic. es). The ecological role of species can vary among populations depending on local and regional differences in diet. This is particularly true for top predators such as the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), which exhibits a highly varied diet throughout its distribution range. Local dietary assessments are therefore critical to fully understand the role of this species within marine ecosystems, as well as its interaction with important ecosystem services such as fisheries. Here, we combined stomach content analyses (SCA) and stable isotope analyses (SIA) to describe bottlenose dolphins diet in the Gulf of Cadiz (North Atlantic Ocean). Prey items identified using SCA included European conger (Conger conger) and European hake (Merluccius merluccius) as the most important ingested prey. However, mass-balance isotopic mixing model (MixSIAR), using δ 13 C and δ 15 N, indicated that the assimilated diet consisted mainly on Sparidae species (e. g. seabream, Diplodus annularis and D. bellottii, rubberlip grunt, Plectorhinchus mediterraneus, and <b>common</b> <b>pandora,</b> Pagellus erythrinus) and a mixture of other species including European hake, mackerels (Scomber colias, S. japonicus and S. scombrus), European conger, red bandfish (Cepola macrophthalma) and European pilchard (Sardina pilchardus). These contrasting results highlight differences in the temporal and taxonomic resolution of each approach, but also point to potential differences between ingested (SCA) and assimilated (SIA) diets. Both approaches provide different insights, e. g. determination of consumed fish biomass for the management of fish stocks (SCA) or identification of important assimilated prey species to the consumer (SIA).

40|$|We {{estimated}} {{the current level}} of knowledge concerning several biological characteristics of the Mediterranean marine fishes by carrying out a gap analysis based on information extracted from the literature, aiming to identify research trends and future needs in the field of Mediterranean fish biology {{that can be used in}} stock assessments, ecosystem modeling and fisheries management. Based on the datasets that emerged from the literature review, there is no information on any biological characteristic for 43 % (n = 310) of the Mediterranean fish species, whereas for an additional 15 % (n = 109) of them there is information about just one characteristic. The gap between current and desired knowledge (defined here as having information on most biological characteristics for at least half of the Mediterranean marine fishes) is smaller in length-weight relationships, which have been studied for 43 % of the species, followed by spawning (39 %), diet (29 %), growth (25 %), maturity (24 %), lifespan (19 %) and fecundity (17 %). The gap is larger in natural mortality for which information is very scarce (8 %). European hake (Merluccius merluccius), red mullet (Mullus barbatus), annular seabream (Diplodus annularis), <b>common</b> <b>pandora</b> (Pagellus erythrinus), European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), European pilchard (Sardina pilchardus) and bogue (Boops boops) were the most studied species, while sharks and rays were among the least studied ones. Only 25 species were fully studied, i. e. there was available information on all their biological characteristics. The knowledge gaps per characteristic varied among the western, central and eastern Mediterranean subregions. The number of available records per species was positively related to total landings, while no relationship emerged with its maximum reported length, trophic level and commercial value. Future research priorities that should be focused on less studied species (e. g. sharks and rays) and mortality/fecundity instead of length-weight relationships, as well as the economy of scientific sampling (using the entire catch to acquire data on as many biological characteristics as possible) are discussed...|$|E
