5|$|Conditions on {{the other}} {{terrestrial}} planets, Mercury and Venus, appear to be too harsh to support {{life as we know}} it. But it has been conjectured that Europa, the fourth-largest moon of Jupiter, may possess a sub-surface ocean of liquid water and <b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> host life.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} set to be {{released}} 10 days before Hurley would face Townsville Supreme Court, on 12 June. There were concerns that the case's jury <b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> be biased by the lyrical content.|$|E
5|$|The {{future of}} the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies may be interlinked: in about five billion years, the two <b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> begin an Andromeda–Milky Way {{collision}} that would spark extensive new star formation.|$|E
2500|$|A {{source of}} {{evidence}} to assist in locating the final resting place of the aircraft is analysis of underwater sound recordings. If the aircraft hit the ocean hard, hydroacoustic recordings <b>could</b> have <b>potentially</b> recorded an impact event. Furthermore, the aircraft's flight data recorders were fitted with underwater [...] "pingers", which emit a detectable, pulsating acoustic signal that <b>could</b> have <b>potentially</b> led searchers to their locations.|$|R

50|$|The {{asteroid}} {{is classified}} as E-type, so it <b>could</b> be <b>potentially</b> associated with aubrite meteorites (enstatite achondrites).|$|R
5|$|Detailed {{floor plans}} of the tower were posted on the New York City's Department of Finance website in May 2011. This {{resulted}} in an uproar from the media and citizens of the surrounding area, who warned that the plans <b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> {{be used for a}} future terrorist attack.|$|E
5|$|In February 1944, the Japanese Combined Fleet {{withdrew from}} its base at Truk and was divided between Palau and Singapore. The {{appearance}} of a powerful Japanese squadron at Singapore concerned the Allies, as it was feared that this force <b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> conduct raids in the Indian Ocean and against Western Australia.|$|E
5|$|In March 1951, {{along with}} {{half a dozen other}} newly badged Glosters, Large was sent to B Company's {{position}} in the low hills above the Imjin River. The Glosters, as part of the 29th Brigade, were defending routes through the valley that <b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> be used by the Chinese in a southbound offensive towards Seoul. On 22 April 1951, they engaged with Chinese troops in the Battle of Imjin.|$|E
25|$|Swallowing {{sounds and}} {{vibrations}} <b>could</b> be <b>potentially</b> used for dysphagia screening, but these approaches {{are in the}} early research stages.|$|R

50|$|Although {{the show}} was ordered as a miniseries, it <b>could</b> have <b>potentially</b> run for {{multiple}} seasons, similar to the network's popular series Battlestar Galactica.|$|R
5|$|In March 2016, Lexus {{announced}} that it will be producing a new flagship vehicle: the two-door LC 500. The vehicle will be produced for late 2017 in a V8 version putting out 467 horsepower. The LC 500h, a V6 hybrid variant, <b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> become available in late 2017 or early 2018.|$|E
5|$|Metformin {{has been}} {{suggested}} to increase production of lactate in the large intestine, which <b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> contribute to lactic acidosis in those with risk factors. However, the clinical significance of this is unknown, {{and the risk of}} metformin-associated lactic acidosis is most commonly attributed to decreased hepatic uptake rather than increased intestinal production.|$|E
5|$|Recent animal {{research}} coupling a murine {{monoclonal antibody}} with doxorubicin {{has created an}} immunoconjugate that was able to eliminate HIV-1 infection in mice. Current treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART) still leaves pockets of HIV within the host. The immunoconjugate <b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> provide a complementary treatment to ART to eradicate antigen-expressing T cells.|$|E
50|$|Recklessness: {{the accused}} was aware the {{criminal}} act <b>could</b> be <b>potentially</b> dangerous {{but did not}} give a second thought to its consequences, for example involuntary culpable homicide.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are other}} intra-abdominal {{malignancies}} that may cross the diaphragm and cause {{disease in the}} chest that <b>could</b> be <b>potentially</b> helped by ITH. Some examples would include: ...|$|R
25|$|He {{believed}} that any undecidability in mathematics, {{such as the}} continuum hypothesis, <b>could</b> be <b>potentially</b> resolved despite the incompleteness theorem, by finding suitable further axioms to add to set theory.|$|R
5|$|The Anglo-American {{immigrants}} {{residing in}} newly-independent Texas overwhelmingly desired immediate annexation by the United States. But, despite his {{strong support for}} Texas independence from Mexico, then-President Andrew Jackson delayed recognizing the new republic until {{the last day of}} his presidency to avoid raising the issue during the 1836 general election. Jackson's political caution was informed by northern concerns that Texas <b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> form several new slave states and undermine the North-South balance in Congress.|$|E
5|$|The Czech Republic is a {{relatively}} safe country: Prague, with the highest crime rate in the country, still {{ranks as one of}} the safest capitals in the European Union. Considering the number of E category licenses issued, there are about 240,000 people who <b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> carry a firearm; however, {{it is not clear how}} many regularly do so.|$|E
5|$|The town of Atherton, {{which lies}} on the tracks, was an early and vocal {{opponent}} of electrification. Residents opposed electrification and the proposed high-speed rail route because the overhead electrical lines would require tree removal and the town <b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> be divided in two by permanently closing the two grade crossings at Fair Oaks Lane and Watkins Avenue.|$|E
50|$|In May 2011, {{the company}} {{announced}} that it was planning to sell aggregated customer information to the Australian Roads and Traffic Authority, which <b>could</b> also <b>potentially</b> be used for targeted speed enforcement.|$|R
50|$|Pain of the Task: Tammy {{severely}} isolated Brent {{from the}} team, delegating him no major duties {{and refusing to}} take any of his ideas. This <b>could</b> have <b>potentially</b> led to Synergy's defeat.|$|R

5|$|WASP-43 {{was first}} {{observed}} by the WASP-South {{part of the}} planet-searching SuperWASP project between January and May 2009. It was determined from the collected data that WASP-43 <b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> host a planet that transited, or crossed in front of, its host star as seen from Earth. Later observations by both the WASP-South and SuperWASP-North sections of SuperWASP between January and May 2010 yielded a total of 13,768 data points.|$|E
5|$|A primary {{pipeline}} {{was laid}} between Portland and a neighboring town during 1889. Haynes oversaw {{construction of the}} ten-mile (16km) long pipeline {{and the creation of}} the wells for pumping the gas. During his numerous buggy rides between the two towns, he first began to conceive of a novel form of motorized transportation. His thoughts on the topic were spurred by his need to regularly change horses because of their inability to endure the long distances and sandy roads he frequently traveled. He theorized that a motorized vehicle would be more economical than horse-and-buggy transportation, and <b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> move at a faster rate of speed.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Farke and {{his colleagues}} in 2014 {{published}} {{a description of a}} new neoceratopsian, Aquilops americanus, through the peer-reviewed science journal PLOS ONE. They analysed their taxa as well as most other primitive ceratopsians to get a consensus cladogram. They created their own data matrix and through it found that many groups of ceratopsians could be supported, and that Aquilops was a basal neoceratopsian that <b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> be a protoceratopsid, leptoceratopsid, or ceratopsid, although any one of these groups would have a large ghost lineage with Aquilops.|$|E

50|$|The bill <b>could</b> have <b>potentially</b> lead to {{sanctions}} against gasoline brokers, tankers and insurers. U.S. companies are prohibitedfrom trade with Iran under unilateral sanctions, but most foreign companies {{are free to}} trade with Tehran.|$|R
50|$|As a state defense force, the Pennsylvania State Guard was {{responsible}} for the stateside duties of the National Guard. This <b>could</b> include <b>potentially</b> repelling an invasion, quelling a riot, or responding to a natural disaster.|$|R
5|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, traffic {{congestion}} {{on the bridge}} had become a serious problem. A 1978 study revealed that although the bridge could handle a peak 1,600 vehicles passing over the bridge per hour, excess traffic pushing it towards its theoretical capacity of 1,920 vehicles per hour <b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> cause gridlock on the bridge. The United States Senate report accompanying the fiscal 1983 appropriation bill for the United States Department of Transportation mentioned that its replacement had become a high priority. A proposed schedule was for the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to receive plans for a cable stayed superstructure by February 1, 1983, and for the project {{to be approved by}} mid-April 1983.|$|E
5|$|Crush {{injuries}} {{are common in}} major disasters, especially in earthquakes. The aftermath of the 1988 Spitak earthquake prompted the establishment, in 1995, of the Renal Disaster Relief Task Force, a working group of the International Society of Nephrology (a worldwide body of kidney experts). Its volunteer doctors and nurses assisted {{for the first time}} in the 1999 İzmit earthquake in Turkey, where 17,480 people died, 5392 were hospitalized and 477 received dialysis, with positive results. Treatment units are generally established outside the immediate disaster area, as aftershocks <b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> injure or kill staff and make equipment unusable.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{atmosphere}} is very effective at absorbing high energy electromagnetic radiation such as x-rays and gamma rays, so {{these types of}} radiation would not reach any dangerous levels at the surface during the burst event itself. The immediate effect on life on Earth from a GRB within a few parsecs would only be a short increase in ultraviolet radiation at ground level, lasting from {{less than a second}} to tens of seconds. This ultraviolet radiation <b>could</b> <b>potentially</b> reach dangerous levels depending on the exact nature and distance of the burst, but it seems unlikely to be able to cause a global catastrophe for life on Earth.|$|E
50|$|Monitor {{produced}} a whistleblowing policy in November 2015 that all NHS organizations in England {{are obliged to}} follow. It explicitly says that anyone bullying or acting against a whistleblower <b>could</b> be <b>potentially</b> liable to disciplinary action.|$|R
50|$|The {{mosquito}} vectors of W. bancrofti have {{a preference}} for human blood; humans are apparently the only animals naturally infected with W. bancrofti. There is no reservoir host, and the disease <b>could</b> therefore <b>potentially</b> be eradicated.|$|R
50|$|While DNS {{blocking}} can be bypassed, {{according to}} ICANN it can damage internet security. Moreover, {{while at the}} moment the infrastructure is used only for unauthorized gambling website, it <b>could</b> be <b>potentially</b> used for other purposes.|$|R
