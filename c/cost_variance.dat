40|$|The direct {{material}} <b>cost</b> <b>variance</b> can be subdivided into a price variance, a quantity variance and a price-quantity interaction variance. The price-quantity interaction variance is rarely {{mentioned in the}} literature because the traditional price variance does not acknowledge an interaction variance. For a number of pragmatic reasons, this approach may be justified for the {{direct material}} price variance. The direct labor <b>cost</b> <b>variance</b> is conceptually similar to the direct material <b>cost</b> <b>variance.</b> Accordingly, the traditional direct labor rate variance also includes a rate-efficiency interaction variance. However, the justifications for incorporating the interaction variance into the direct material price variance {{do not apply to}} the direct labor rate variance. This paper explores the possibility of separating the rate-efficiency interaction variance from the direct labor rate variance. This approach may be more aligned with the concept of responsibility accounting than the traditional method of calculating the direct labor rate variance.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that many financial and cost variables are non-normally distributed. For example, empirical studies of financial ratios and <b>cost</b> <b>variance</b> data have found non-normality. However, instead of identifying the correct distribution of these financial variables, many of these decision models (e. g. bankruptcy prediction, bond rating prediction, cost-volume-profit analysis and the <b>cost</b> <b>variance</b> investigation decision) have simply adopted an assumption of normality. This is contrary to the empirical evidence which has suggested that some of these input variables are non-normally distributed. The reason for this common adoption of the normal distribution assumption could be attributed to the lack of knowledge regarding the appropriate distribution function for the variable. In order to encourage the use of the appropriate distribution function for the required financial variable, this paper examines this aspect. The objective {{of this study is to}} assist in identifying an appropriate distribution function for modelling non-normally distributed accounting variables. A three-step procedure is described and actual <b>cost</b> <b>variance</b> data of a Fortune 500 company's manufacturing plant are used to illustrate the procedure. © 1993 Academic Press.

The study was an evaluation of how constructions cost on projects were managed. This entails establishing how project costs were planned, how projects costs were controlled and reported and finally how project costs at completion were analysed. This was done through questionnaires. The major findings were that of inadequate planning for project costs. This {{could be attributed to}} the fact that, although the major cost planning factors such as specifications and statement of work (Scope) were incorporated in the cost plan, they were not complete at the time the cost plan was determined. Consequently, they were the major causes of <b>cost</b> <b>variances</b> at post contract stage. Furthermore, cost control was not adequately conducted on projects. Therefore, it is recommended that the government should provide a detailed brief and specifications to confirm the project requirements and also have standardised cost control measures on projects.

Recently it was reported that even though there is various availability of cost control techniques and project control software in the construction industry, most of the projects still does not achieve their stipulated budget. Thus, the aim of this study will look into developing a framework of cost control in minimising the <b>cost</b> <b>variance</b> during the construction stage. The study was carried out by investigating the current cost control practices among building contractors, analysing major causes of <b>cost</b> <b>variance</b> and recommend the appropriate measures on cost control to minimise the <b>cost</b> <b>variance.</b> A total of 320 questionnaires were sent to G 7 /Class A building contracting firms within the Klang Valley and followed by interviews among the eight (8) construction experts.

40|$|Quantification and {{forecasting}} of cost uncertainty for aerospace innovations {{is challenged}} by conditions of small data which arises out of having few measurement points, little prior experience, unknown history, low data quality, {{and conditions of}} deep uncertainty. Literature research suggests that no frameworks exist which specifically address cost estimation under such conditions. In order to provide contemporary cost estimating techniques with an innovative perspective for addressing such challenges a framework based {{on the principles of}} spatial geometry is described. The framework consists of a method for visualising cost uncertainty and a dependency model for quantifying and forecasting cost uncertainty. Cost uncertainty is declared to represent manifested and unintended future <b>cost</b> <b>variance</b> with a probability of 100 % and an unknown quantity and innovative starting conditions considered to exist when no verified and accurate cost model is available. The shape of data is used as an organising principle and the attribute of geometrical symmetry of <b>cost</b> <b>variance</b> point clouds used for the quantification of cost uncertainty. The results of the investigation suggest that the uncertainty of a cost estimate at any future point in time may be determined by the geometric symmetry of the <b>cost</b> <b>variance</b> data in its point cloud form at the time of estimation. Recommendations for future research include using the framework to determine the “most likely values” of estimates in Monte Carlo simulations and generalising the dependency model introduced.

In construction project operation, often there is a project <b>cost</b> <b>variance</b> in terms of the material, equipments, manpower, subcontractor, overhead cost, and general condition. Material is the main component in construction projects. Therefore, if the material management is not properly managed it will create a project <b>cost</b> <b>variance.</b> Project cost can be controlled by taking corrective actions towards the <b>cost</b> <b>variance.</b> Therefore a methodology is used to diagnose and evaluate the procurement process involved in material management and launch a continuous improvement was developed and applied.

The results obtained show that the main problem of procurement is related to schedule delays and lack of specified quality for the project. To prevent this situation it is often necessary to dedicate important resources like money, personnel, time, etc. To monitor and control the process.

40|$|Since {{engineering}} designs generally {{involve a}} number of elements about which only partial information is available, design optimization should be conducted under conditions of risk. Utility is nonlinear with cost or revenue; consequently, the enterprise's view of risk is considered through utilities assigned to costs or revenues which deviate from the mean. This is termed "risk programming" to distinguish it from previous contributions in this area. General forms of the objective function, yielding expected utility, are derived for utility functions of two types. When the total cost distribution is normal, an exact solution requiring only a knowledge of expected total cost and the <b>cost</b> <b>variance</b> is obtained. For nonnormal cost distributions, an upper bound of the objective function, requiring knowledge only of the same two quantities, is obtained. A model for engineering design, which provides both the expected total cost and <b>cost</b> <b>variance,</b> is developed based upon division {{of the elements of}} variability into several categories.

In the ﬁrst stream, I seek to explore the relationship by theoretical derivation and simulation. In the second stream, I examine the FDI equation by empirical analyses. My second Chapter 2 ̆ 2 Strategic Trade Policy and the Investment Timing under Cost Uncertainty 2 ̆ 2 seeks to examine the optimal trade policy under both demand uncertainty and cost uncertainties when the timing of investment is endogenous. Based on Albaek (1990), this Chapter adds stochastic cost structure into Dewit and Leahy (2004) 2 ̆ 7 s model. An interesting result was found that when demand variance is small and there is no <b>cost</b> <b>variance</b> to the foreign firm, the home government would like to enforce home firm delay before enforcing foreign firm delay when the home firm 2 ̆ 7 s <b>cost</b> <b>variance</b> increases. My third Chapter 2 ̆ 2 Strategic Trade Policy and the Investment Timing under Cost Uncertainty with Private Information 2 ̆ 2 studies the optimal trade policy and the timing of investment under cost uncertainties and private information. It is assumed that cost random components are only observed privately by each firm and kept unknown to the other when firms decide how much to invest.

40|$|Novel {{high value}} {{manufacturing}} products by default lack the minimum a priori data needed for forecasting <b>cost</b> <b>variance</b> over of time using regression based techniques. Forecasts which attempt {{to achieve this}} therefore suffer from significant variance which in turn places significant strain on budgetary assumptions and financial planning. The authors argue that for novel high value manufacturing products short interval control through continuous revision is necessary until {{the context of the}} baseline estimate stabilises sufficiently for extending the time intervals for revision. Case study data from the United States Department of Defence Scheduled Annual Summary Reports (1986 - 2013) is used to exemplify the approach. In this respect it must be remembered that the context of a baseline cost estimate is subject to a large number of assumptions regarding future plausible scenarios, the probability of such scenarios, and various requirements related to such. These assumptions change over time and the degree of their change is indicated by the extent that <b>cost</b> <b>variance</b> follows a forecast propagation curve that has been defined in advance. The presented approach determines the stability of this context by calculating the effort required to identify a propagation pattern for <b>cost</b> <b>variance</b> using the principles of Kolmogorov complexity. Only when that effort remains stable over a sufficient period of time can the revision periods for the cost estimate baseline be changed from continuous to discrete time intervals. The practical implication of the presented approach for novel high value manufacturing products is that attention is shifted from the bottom up or parametric estimation activity to the continuous management of the context for that cost estimate itself. This in turn enables a faster and more sustainable stabilisation of the estimating context which then creates the conditions for reducing cost estimate uncertainty in an actionable and timely manner...|$|E
