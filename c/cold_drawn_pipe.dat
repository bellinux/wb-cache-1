40|$|Testing of the {{susceptibility}} towards hydrogen {{induced stress}} cracking (HISC) for five 25 %Cr super duplex stainless steels (SDSS) under cathodic protection (CP) in seawater has been conducted. The materials were from pipes produced through different production methods; hot extrusion {{with and without}} subsequent <b>cold</b> <b>drawing,</b> manufactured from a forged bar and centrifugally cast. The testing {{was carried out in}} cortest proof rings on three test specimens pre-charged with hydrogen and one reference specimen without hydrogen until fracture occurred. Hydrogen measurements were conducted and the fracture surfaces were examined in a scanning electron microscope (SEM), and the embrittlement through thickness was indexed. The possibility of secondary cracking was also investigated using the SEM. In addition, the microstructures were examined using optical microscopy (OM) and assessed compared to the HISC testing results. The austenite spacing was also measured. The hydrogen measurements together with the presence of secondary cracking of all test materials confirmed HISC being the fracture mechanism. The test results indicated that all SDSS materials tested are susceptible to HISC, and that the hot extruded material with no cold deformation has a higher HISC resistance while centrifugally cast materials are more prone to HISC than the other production methods. The fracture surfaces of all hydrogen charged test materials showed features indicating a reduction in ductility due to HISC as well as both ductile and brittle fracture characteristics across the surfaces. The placement of the ductile and brittle features varied, and both could be found close to the centre and edges of the fracture surfaces. The fracture surfaces for the reference specimens showed mostly ductile fracture characteristics. The results from the HISC testing were discussed compared to available literature on the subject of HISC in SDSS, and the susceptibility of the materials from the different materials towards HISC were ranked from lowest to highest based on the overall test performance and measurements conducted. The ranking of production methods is as follows: hot extruded pipes > hot extruded <b>pipes</b> with subsequent <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> > forginged <b>pipes</b> > centrifugal cast pipes...|$|R

The structure of the three-phase morphology of the {{linear low density polyethylene}} monofilaments was investigated by combining these measurements. It was found that the most important structure variation was found in the intermediate or rigid amorphous phase, whereby the amounts of crystalline and amorphous phases were nearly constant and almost independent of the <b>cold</b> <b>draw</b> ratio. The intermediate third phase contains gauche and trans molecules and the amount of trans molecules was increased with the <b>cold</b> <b>draw</b> ratio and was directly related to this 2 <b>cold</b> <b>draw</b> ratio.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Progressive <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> in {{eutectoid}} steels {{produces a}} preferential {{orientation of the}} pearlitic micorstructure in the wire axis or drawing direction. This affects the posterior behaviour of the steels under environmentally assisted cracking (EAC) conditions. The experimental results show that <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> induces strength anisotropy in the steel, and thus the resistance to EAC is a directional property {{that depends on the}} angle in relation to the drawing direction. Therefore, an initial transverse crack changes its propagation direction to approach that of the wire axis, thus producing mixed mode propagation, the deflection angle being an increasing function of the <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> degree. This experimental result may be explained by micro-mechanical considerations {{on the basis of the}} lamellar microstructure of the steels. A relationship is established between the microstructural angles and the deflection angles of the macroscopic crack in EAC, thus providing a materials science type relationship between the microstructure and the macroscopic crack paths...|$|R

The experimental procedure consisted of fatigue tests on cylindrical bars under tensile loading, using steps with decreasing amplitude of stress and constant stress range during each step. Results show how the <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> process improves the fatigue behaviour of eutectoid steel by retarding the fatigue crack growth rate in the Paris regime. The fracto-metallographic analysis shows how the microstructural anisotropy of the drawn steel (consequence of the drawing process itself) creates {{a change in the}} fracture crack path in the form of local micro-deflections (and thus multiaxially-driven fatigue propagation at the very local microscale). The net fatigue surface increases with <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> due to the higher angle of crack micro-deflections {{in the case of the}} heavily drawn material, thereby allowing a correction of the Paris law curves by considering the real (experimental) fatigue crack path (multi-deflected; locally multiaxial) and the theoretical fatigue crack path (non deflected; locally uniaxial) ...|$|R
