The current study, conducted in Guelph, Canada, explored how this differential risk of injury may arise. It compares the supervision behaviors of mothers to those of their older children when each was the designated supervisor of a young child, shown on a videotape to engage in no risk, risk, and rule violation behaviors in a home situation. The mothers and older child supervisors were told to imagine the toddler on the videotape was the young child in their own family, and to stop the tape and speak to the child whenever they would in real life. Results indicated that supervisees were allowed to engage in more risk behaviors when supervised by older siblings than by mothers. Sibling supervisors reacted to risk behaviors with more prohibitions, whereas mothers adopted a teaching orientation and gave more explanations and directions in response to risk behaviors by the supervisee. Implications for injury prevention and directions for future research are discussed. Canada <b>Children</b> Injuries <b>Supervision</b> Siblings Mothers Risk...|$|R

40|$|This study {{originates}} from concerns {{raised by}} a number of examples of children being harmed by either a direct lack of parental supervision, or by indirect state intervention, evident in both media and academic forums. This suggested some disharmony between the legislative requirements, the parental understanding, and welfare practitioner interpretations of minimum acceptable <b>child</b> <b>supervision.</b> The aim of this dissertation is to better understand the major influences on, and the de-facto practice of decision making with regard to parental supervision of children. This study critically examines and presents the results of (predominantly) quantitative research conducted with parental and welfare practitioner sample groups, within the region of West Cumbria, England. Current UK law regarding <b>child</b> <b>supervision</b> is neither definitive nor arbitrary, it is ambiguous. Indeed there is no prescriptive legislation with regard to the common parlance phrases “home alone”, “child maturity” or “likelihood of harm”. As a result of this, understanding of what is and what is not acceptable <b>child</b> <b>supervision</b> can vary between geographical, socio-political, or generational categories. This study initially investigates the understanding and practices of parents and welfare practitioners by evaluating their experiences, influences, knowledge base and values. The raw data obtained from the two disparate groups is collated and analysed to identify trends or deviations, and then assessed with regard to legislative requirements and compared to the Government endorsed charity guidelines. The study identified some commonality between the two control groups with respect to influences and decision making, and some deviation regarding awareness and identification of hazards. In addition it indicates a lack of in-depth knowledge of legislation, whilst reducing concerns of misinterpretation of guidelines as legal requirements...|$|E

Results: Children were between the ages of 6 and 11, and five of the families resided in neighborhoods in which at least 20 % of the households reported a total income below the poverty level. Adults described efforts to develop active lifestyles for their families. Children talked about experiencing different types of behavioral influences from parents and other adult relatives. Conclusions: The findings suggest that resource limitations, neighborhood characteristics, and adults’ perceptions of children’s activity needs influence the ways that parents and adult relatives engage children in physical activity...|$|E

40|$|The {{agricultural}} sector features {{prominently in the}} rates of ATV injuries and fatalities amongst children in New Zealand. This research project assesses the nature and scope of ATV accidents to children on New Zealand farms and provides recommendations that attempt {{to meet the needs}} of all relevant stakeholders. In particular, we believe that the most effective means of reducing the rates of ATV injuries and fatalities amongst children involves a strategy which recognises the unique circumstances which give rise to practical impediments to safer farm workplace practices. We identified three distinct groups of children in the literature, each facing a different major risk category. Very young children were most at risk as passengers. As age increased the highest risks applied to bystanders, while older children and teenagers were more likely to be injured as drivers. The high risks to younger children as passengers and bystanders were indicative of underlying problems associated with childcare options – or, more particularly, the lack of childcare options. Accidents involving older children were associated more closely with practices around <b>child</b> <b>supervision</b> and involved aspects of farming culture, rather than practical barriers to safer practices...|$|E

40|$|Objectives To {{describe}} the development, community acceptability, feasibility, and sustainability of a pilot drowning prevention intervention for rural children, 1 - 4 years old, in Bangladesh. Methods A prevention package was formulated and piloted in four rural communities of Bangladesh for 3 months. Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews were organised with stakeholders to elicit community acceptability, feasibility, and sustainability {{of the proposed}} interventions. Results Increased supervision of children, raising awareness on water safety, and educating the community on first response skills were the three core aspects identified through workshops {{to include in the}} intervention package. During development of interventions emphasis was given to finding low-cost local resources. To increase <b>child</b> <b>supervision,</b> creation of drowning-safe homes and establishment of community cre`ches were identified. To create heightened water safety, formation of village committees and conduction of courtyard and social autopsy meetings with communities were considered.

Analysis of the data revealed that mothers had an overall favorable opinion of the services. The opinions relating to direct child care showed a more favorable opinion than did those relating to emotional support and anticipatory guidance. The items relating to anticipatory guidance demonstrated the least favorable opinions of the three categories, but was still favorably skewed. Conclusions of this study were that the nursing conferences were well accepted by the majority of the mothers who participated in the study, but that the areas of emotional support and anticipatory guidance were not recognized by some mothers as useful. Recommendations were made that the nurse in the conferences should work toward better interpretation of her counseling and educative functions, and that the nursing conferences be continued...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{current study}} aims to {{investigate}} the attitudes of parents (N= 1087) regarding the influence of computer games on their children's development in the following aspects: time they spend at the computer to play, types of favourite games, ways of <b>child</b> <b>supervision,</b> benefits and disadvantages of computer games. The results of the research show: 30. 47 % of children may access the computer anytime they want; the computer is mostly used for games (36. 28 %); 42. 87 % of parents supervise their children's activities at the computer only when they have spare time; 50 % of parents allow their children to spend 1 - 2 hours at computer games every day, while 28. 54 % allow 3 - 4 hours (and more) of computer games every day. The biggest benefits of computer games, according to parents, are thinking development (9. 60 %), observation capacity (8. 27 %), and creativity (8. 01 %). The biggest disadvantages of computer games are the lack of physical movement (13. 37 %), sight disorders (13. 15 %) and agitation (8. 58 %). Parents recognize that games can have powerful effects on children, and should therefore set limits on the amount and content of games their children play. In this way, we can realize the potential benefits while minimizing the potential harms...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To assess {{pediatrician}} {{goals and}} practice in preventive counseling, and to use social learning theory to examine physician attitudes about preventive health issues, time, and reimbursement to explain physician counseling behavior. DESIGN: Random sample survey of American Academy of Pediatrics fellows. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1620 pediatricians were surveyed with a return rate of 72 %. The 556 pediatricians who had finished training and who currently performed <b>child</b> health <b>supervision</b> were included. METHODS: Pediatricians were asked about their goals in 6 areas of health supervision: biomedical issues, development, behavior, family functioning, safety education, and supportive interpersonal interaction. They were also asked about the prevalence of counseling, importance of specific topics, their self-efficacy, outcome expectation in these areas, and their concerns about time and reimbursement for preventive counseling. RESULTS: Assurance of physical health and normal development {{were the most important}} goals of <b>child</b> health <b>supervision</b> among the pediatricians surveyed. Goals involving behavioral, family, and safety issues were less important and less likely to be addressed in practice. Most did not regularly discuss family stress, substance abuse, gun safety, and television. In these areas, physicians had less confidence they could provide guidance and lower expectation that they could prevent problems. Only 17 % felt that they receive adequate reimbursement for preventive counseling. Most have adequate time (53 %) and receive adequate respect (57 %) for their preventive efforts. Physicians who were more concerned about time for preventive counseling reported less overall counseling (r = - 0. 28, PCONCLUSIONS: Physician goals in <b>child</b> health <b>supervision</b> were primarily biomedical, with psychosocial and safety issues of lesser importance.

Design: A qualitative study using focus group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews (KIIs). Setting: Communities of Makwanpur district of Nepal. Participants: FGDs {{were conducted with}} female community health volunteers (FCHVs), school children of grades 6 to 9; and mothers of children. One FGD was conducted for each group. Out of 27 participants 21 were female. Five KIIs were conducted with paramedics, Child NGO worker, Child protection officer and a teacher. Results: The respondents considered that injuries are normal phenomena to children, and all children {{are at risk of}} different types of injuries. Participants believed {{that it is difficult to}} predict and prevent children from being injured. The most common cause of child injuries was reported as their everyday activities; and ignorance and lack of knowledge. They also associated illiteracy and poverty with child injuries.

Pediatric patients hospitalized for acute poisoning at the Amirkola Children's Hospital, Babol, Iran, over a 6 -year period (1995 – 2001) were evaluated prospectively. A special attention was given to poisoning in relation to different age groupings. During the 6 -year period, the poisoning cases increased from 18 to 98 (7 % vs. 37. 5 %). Eighty-one percent of children were younger than 6 years of age and had a benign course. The majority of cases occurred in children aged 2 to 6 years. Males under the age of 13 years had a higher frequency of poisoning. Drugs were the most common agents of poisoning in children (31. 6 %), followed by hydrocarbon chemicals such as kerosene (31. 2 %).

40|$|Objective To {{examine the}} effects of {{parenting}} distractions on supervising behaviors in relation to child risky behaviors. Methods Forty preschool-aged children and their parents were randomly assigned to occupy a simulated home living room for 45 min with the parent involved in either (a) no planned distraction, (b) a telephone call distraction, (c) a TV show distraction, or (d) a computer assignment distraction. Parent and child behaviors were recorded and coded. Results Parent supervising behaviors were significantly intercorrelated but revealed no relation to risky child behavior. Children showed higher risky behavior during parental distractions and steadily over time when parent distractions occurred. Additionally, younger children were {{more likely to engage in}} risky behavior when compared to older children. Conclusions Parents showed significant reductions in their ability to supervise children during distractions, limiting the ability to provide education or to take immediate action necessary to prevent or minimize possible injuries. Key words childhood injuries; observation; parent distractions; supervision. Unintentional injuries are the most significant health challenge for children and adolescents from age 1 to 19 years with home injuries a major proportion of the problem (Guyer et al., 1999; National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, 2001, 2002). For preschool children, home injuries likely result from child, parent, and environmental variables interacting within family and cultural contexts.
