40|$|The {{following}} paper {{presents a}} detailed description of a thermo-mechanical analysis method of an exhaust manifold for a four-stroke automotive Diesel engine, where {{the focus is on the}} physically correct description of the transient heat transfer on the hot gas side. For this purpose a simple, but very effective method has been developed to calculate the quasi steady statae heat transfer conditions and gas temperatures along the inner manifold gas path. The method is based on a coupled 1 -dimensional exhaust gas flow and a 3 -dimensional FE thermal analysis. The influence of the operational characteristic of a four-stroke engine on the local heat transfer is considered by appropriate correction factors. The impact of the transient consideration on the stress-strain state of the component and therefore on the life is verified and explained via a dedicated example. The analysis results show very clearly the impact of the transient consideration on the stress distribution. The peak stresses do not occur at full load conditions, but at a transient state. Taking this transient peak stress with the corresponding strain range over the cycle at <b>cyclic</b> <b>stabilized</b> material <b>conditions</b> and the peak temperature, the life of the component can be analysed with the help of appropriaate fatigue data...|$|R
40|$|The fatigue {{properties}} of multiphase steels {{are an important}} consideration in the automotive industry. The different microstructural phases present in these steels can influence the strain life and <b>cyclic</b> <b>stabilized</b> strength of the material due {{to the way in}} which these phases accommodate the applied cyclic strain.

It is shown that the higher strain life and <b>cyclic</b> <b>stabilized</b> strength of the TRIP steel can be attributed to an increased yield strength. Despite the presence of significant levels of retained austenite in the TRIP steel, both steels exhibited similar cyclic softening behavior at a range of strain amplitudes due to comparable ferrite volume fractions and yielding characteristics.

Classic strain amplitude sweeps were first carried out at two different temperatures (ambient and 80 degrees C) on both filled and unfilled nitrile rubber specimens in order to observe {{the influence of the}} fillers, temperature and loading conditions on the Payne effect. Some specimens were then subjected to a high number of cycles to study the variations in the viscoelastic properties and the sensitivity of the Payne effect to cyclic loading tests at several given strain amplitudes.

40|$|Background: People with macular disease often face {{difficulties}} {{using their}} preferred retinal locus (PRL) during visual tasks. These difficulties {{are due to}} impaired oculomotor control, amongst other causes. The aim of this work was to investigate whether stabilizing the visual target at the PRL is beneficial for visual acuity and reading. Methods: Control of retinal image instability at the PRL was achieved using an eyetracker that moved the target according to the eye movements. Crowded and uncrowded visual acuity was measured at the PRL in people with macular disease and in healthy peripheral retina of control subjects. RSVP reading speed was also measured using the same method of stabilization at the PRL and healthy peripheral retina. Results: Results {{of a series of}} experiments showed that stabilizing the visual target can improve visual performance in most cases. In healthy peripheral retina crowded visual acuity improved when the image was stabilized and reduced when fixation instability was over-compensated.

40|$|Thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPUs) are {{polymeric}} materials employed {{in a wide}} array of applications in the industrial field. Knowledge of their mechanical behavior is essential in order to obtain an accurate prediction of stresses and deformations resulting from loading. Mechanical and physical properties of these materials have been studied in the past, but their stress-strain behavior in the presence of cyclic loading has comparatively received much less attention. In this paper, experimental and constitutive modeling aspects concerning cyclic mechanical response of a TPU are investigated. The effect of imposing a cyclic strain on a TPU is studied by means of an experimental procedure based on alternate-symmetric tests in strain control at different strain levels and frequencies. During the tests, the increase in temperature due to the hysteretic heating can also be controlled by means of a compressed air cooling apparatus specifically devised. By taking advantage of the possibility of controlling and <b>stabilizing</b> temperature, the <b>cyclic</b> mechanical response can then be investigated at different temperatures and strain levels. A transient thermal analysis using finite element method (FEM) was also carried out to investigate temperature distribution on the specimen. TPU exhibited cyclic softening, and by comparing stabilized material response at different temperatures, cyclic softening was shown to be composed of a mechanical contribution and a thermal component. The TPU's stress-strain curve changed considerably under cyclic loading conditions. In particular, cyclic softening was observed to increase with temperature and imposed cyclic strain, with a progressive shrinking of hysteresis loop passing from virgin <b>condition</b> to <b>stabilized</b> <b>cyclic</b> <b>condition.</b> Based on the experimental data, the cyclic curve could be determined as a function of temperature and could be fitted with a hyperelastic law in which material parameters are temperature dependent. The TPU exhibited significant sensitivity to cyclic loading, and this study demonstrated the importance of considering mechanical response in cyclic condition for design purposes. In particular, the identification of mechanical and thermal contributions to cyclic softening can be useful when studying fatigue failure mechanisms of these materials. Knowledge of cyclic curve can help when developing constitutive model for polymers to better predict a long-term behavior when cyclic loading is expected. The introduction of a dependence of cyclic curve on temperature allows considering simultaneously the new "material state" of the cycled polymer and, with some limitations, the thermal influence on mechanical response...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} was {{originally published in}} The Journal of Biological Chemistry. © the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular BiologyInternational audienceWe have studied the sample concentration-dependent and external stress-dependent stability of native and reconstituted nucleosomal arrays. Whereas upon stretching a single chromatin fiber in a solution of very low chromatin concentration the statistical distribution of DNA length released upon nucleosome unfolding shows only one population centered around approximately 25 nm, in nucleosome <b>stabilizing</b> <b>conditions</b> a second population with average length of approximately 50 nm was observed. Using radioactively labeled histone H 3 and H 2 B, we demonstrate that upon lowering the chromatin concentration to very low values, first the linker histones are released, followed by the H 2 A-H 2 B dimer, whereas the H 3 -H 4 tetramer remains stably attached to DNA even at the lowest concentration studied. The nucleosomal arrays reconstituted on a 5 S rDNA tandem repeat exhibited similar behavior. This suggests that the 25 -nm disruption length {{is a consequence of}} the histone H 2 A-H 2 B dimer dissociation from the histone octamer.

40|$|To {{determine}} whether a protein folding reaction can occur {{in the absence of}} a dominant barrier is crucial for understanding its complexity. Here direct ultrafast kinetic measurements have been used to study the initial submillisecond (sub-ms) folding reaction of the small protein barstar. The cooperativity of the initial folding reaction has been explored by using two probes: fluorescence resonance energy transfer, through which the contraction of two intramolecular distances is measured, and the binding of 8 -anilino- 1 -naphthalene sulfonic acid, through which the formation of hydrophobic clusters is monitored. A fast chain contraction is shown to precede the formation of hydrophobic clusters, indicating that the sub-ms folding reaction is not cooperative. The observed rate constant of the sub-ms folding reaction monitored by 8 -anilino- 1 -naphthalene sulfonic acid fluorescence has been found to be the same in <b>stabilizing</b> <b>conditions</b> (low urea concentrations), in which specific structure is formed, and in marginally <b>stabilizing</b> <b>conditions</b> (higher urea concentrations), where virtually no structure is formed in the product of the sub-ms folding reaction. The observation that the folding rate is independent of the folding conditions suggests that the initial folding reaction occurs {{in the absence of a}} dominant free energy barrier. These results provide kinetic evidence that the formation of specific structure need not be slowed down by any significant free energy barrier during the course of a very fast protein folding reaction...|$|R
