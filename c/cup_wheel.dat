50|$|A diamond {{grinding}} <b>cup</b> <b>wheel</b> is a metal-bonded {{diamond tool}} with diamond segments welded or cold-pressed on a steel (or other metal, such as aluminum) wheel body, which usually {{looks like a}} cup. Diamond grinding cup wheels are usually mounted on concrete grinders to grind abrasive building materials like concrete, granite and marble.|$|E
50|$|Diamond {{segments}} are {{the function}} {{parts of a}} metal-bonded diamond tool. The metal-bonded diamond tool can be a metal-bonded diamond blade, a diamond grinding <b>cup</b> <b>wheel,</b> a diamond core drill bit, a diamond gang saw blade, etc. The diamonds of a metal-bonded diamond tool {{are all in the}} tool's diamond segments to play their role of cutting or grinding.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{hydrostatic}} {{seal rings}} {{are one of}} the most important components used in reactor coolant pumps. They are generally made of hard materials such as silicon nitride, alumina, silicon carbide and tungsten carbide. Meanwhile, the form error should be within the length of one to two helium light bands and the surface roughness should be in the scale of nanometers, which make them difficult to machining. In order to solve this problem, a high accuracy grinding method using a large <b>cup</b> <b>wheel</b> had been proposed and the tilt angle of the <b>cup</b> <b>wheel</b> spindle become a crucial factor affecting the ground form errors. This paper addresses a novel method for high-accuracy calibrating the tilt angle of the <b>cup</b> <b>wheel</b> spindle to fit the extremely shallow taper angle of the seal ring conical surface, and the mathematical model is established incorporating a standard optical flat with a high-accuracy laser displacement sensor. The practicability of this method is verified by grinding a seal ring sample with the outer diameter is 200 mm and the taper angle is 700 µrad. It is found that the taper angle error is only 1. 72 µrad and the radical profile error of the conical surface is about 0. 22 µm...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a {{parametric}} investigation on ultra precision grinding of combination materials of zirconia and silica. Rotational grinding was adopted for the generation of spherical convex surfaces using metal and resin bonded cup wheels. The wheels have grit sizes ranging from 4 to 20 mum. A simplified geometrical model was used to analyse the effects of wheel wear on ground dimensional accuracy. Besides, a new truing and dressing technique of the <b>cup</b> <b>wheel</b> using loose abrasives was introduced. This new truing and dressing technique enables the precision profile truing of cup wheels. With the well prepared <b>cup</b> <b>wheel,</b> high form accuracy (average PV similar to 0. 25 mum) with mirror/near-mirror surface finish for silica and zirconia was achieved. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.

40|$|Abstract. Corner radius end mill, whose cutting {{capability}} is mostly {{affected by the}} relief surface, {{is a kind of}} highly effective end mill [1]. So a novel mathematical model of relief surface curve about corner radius end mill, which is verified with a five-axis computer numerical control (CNC) grinding machine and simulated based on a system CAM, is derived and presented in the paper. According to the proposed tool coordinates system and the mechanical coordinate of the machine, the relative motion between the <b>cup</b> <b>wheel</b> and the tool is determined. In order to obtain an accurate relief curve when machining, the model of a <b>cup</b> <b>wheel</b> edge is also introduced. The coordinates of grinding point when grinding relief surface are calculated. With the input data of the corner radius end geometry, wheels geometry, wheel setting and machine setting, the NC code is generated automatically from the program. Then the code is used to simulate in 3 Dimension before actual machining. Finally, the NC code will be used for machining in the CNC grinding machine. The roundness of the round corner in the final product is very well, means this model is effective...|$|E
40|$|The {{precision}} {{fabrication of}} spherical lenses is increasingly {{required for the}} latest applications of compact and highresolution video-recording systems. In this study, we propose the efficient and precise grinding of spherical lenses with cup wheels and the ELID process. The experimental setup was prepared using a tilted rotary table and castiron-bonded ring tools with an ELID system. The effects of ELID on the surface finish and {{the stability of the}} curve generation process were investigated. The spherical accuracy and surface finish of the mirrorlike ELID ground lenses were evaluated and determined to be highly satisfactory. Another experiment on the generation of microspherical lenses was attempted using a very small <b>cup</b> <b>wheel,</b> and the successful grinding of a φ 1 mm lens was confirmed using the devised system...|$|E
30|$|To {{estimate}} the ages at recruitment for the glass eels of A. japonica, sagittal otoliths were extracted and embedded in an epoxy resin (Epofix, Struers, Westlake, OH, USA) (n[*]=[*] 12). The otoliths were ground {{to expose the}} core with a diamond <b>cup</b> <b>wheel</b> (Discoplan-TS, Struers) and then polished with colloidal silica suspension (OP-S suspension, Struers) on a polishing wheel (LaboPol- 35 equipped with LaboForce-Mi, Struers). Subsequently, the otoliths were etched with 50  mM hydrochloric acid and coated with platinum-palladium for the observation by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, S- 4800, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). The SEM photographs were taken at various magnifications of[*]×[*] 300 to[*]×[*] 2, 500 and were used to {{count the number of}} daily increment rings. The widths of each ring were also measured to clarify the early life stages according to previous studies (Otake et al. 1994; Arai et al. 1997). Linear regression analysis was performed by a StatPlus:mac version 2009 (AnalystSoft Inc., Vancouver, Canada).|$|E
50|$|There {{are various}} styles and {{specifications}} of diamond grinding <b>cup</b> <b>wheels</b> to fit various application requirements. The ones with many big diamond segments can undertake heavy workloads, for example, grinding concrete and stone, while those with small or sparse diamond segments are normally used for fast removal of paints, wallpapers, glues, epoxy and other surface coatings.|$|R
40|$|Silicon carbide (SiC) is {{well known}} for its {{excellent}} material properties, high durability, high wear resistance, light weight and extreme hardness. Among the engineering applications of this material, it is an excellent candidate for optic mirrors used in an Airbone Laser (ABL) device. However, the low fracture toughness and extreme brittleness characteristics of SiC are predominant factors for its poor machinability. This paper presents surface grinding of SiC using diamond <b>cup</b> <b>wheels</b> to assess the performance of diamond grits with respect to the roughness produced on the machined surfaces and also the morphology of the ground work-piece. Resin bonded diamond <b>cup</b> <b>wheels</b> of grit sizes 46 µm, 76 µm and 107 µm; depth of cut of 10 µm, 20 µm and 30 µm; and feed rate of 2 mm/min, 12 mm/min and 22 mm/min were used during this machining investigation.

50|$|Diamond {{grinding}} <b>cup</b> <b>wheels</b> {{are used}} in different-roughness grindings. For coarse grinding, the bond should be softer and the diamonds' quality should be higher, because {{in this case the}} diamonds become blunt more easily. The diamond grit should be bigger, normally from 35 grit to 50 grit. For this is coarse grinding and big grit can improve working efficiency. The diamond concentration can be lower.|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesWorkers who {{fabricate}} stone countertops using {{hand tools}} {{are at risk}} of silicosis from overexposure to respirable crystalline silica. This study explored the efficacy of simple engineering controls {{that can be used for}} dust suppression during use of hand tools by stone countertop fabricators. MethodsControlled experiments were conducted to measure whether wet methods and on-tool local exhaust ventilation (LEV) reduced respirable dust exposures during use of various powered hand tools on quartz-rich engineered stone. Respirable dust samples collected during edge grinding with a diamond <b>cup</b> <b>wheel</b> and a silicon carbide abrasive wheel were analyzed gravimetrically as well as by x-ray diffraction to determine silica content. A personal optical aerosol monitor was used simultaneously with the respirable dust samples and also for rapid assessment of controls for polishing, blade cutting, and core drilling. ResultsOn-tool LEV and sheet-flow-wetting were effective in reducing exposures, especially when used in combination. Sheet-flow-wetting with LEV reduced geometric mean exposures by as much as 95 %. However, typical water-spray-wetting on a grinding cup was less effective when combined with LEV than without LEV. Mean silica content of respirable dust samples from grinding operations was 53 %, and respirable mass and silica mass were very highly correlated (r = 0. 980). Optical concentration measures were moderately well correlated with gravimetric measures (r = 0. 817), but on average the optical measures during a single trial using the factory calibration were only one-fifth the simultaneous gravimetric measures. ConclusionsSheet-flow-wetting combined with on-tool LEV is an effective engineering control for reducing respirable dust exposures during engineered stone edge grinding and blade cutting. On the other hand, addition of LEV to some water-spray-wetted tools may reduce the effectiveness of the wet method.

40|$|AbstractBased on {{analysis}} of surface average temperature and burn degree, this article obtains the threshold temperature of surface burn in grinding titanium alloy with <b>cup</b> <b>wheels.</b> Meanwhile, {{the impact of}} the burn degree on the metallographic structure of workpiece surface and metallurgical phase transformations is investigated. In order to reduce the grinding temperature and improve the grinding efficiency, a self-inhaling structure <b>cup</b> segmented <b>wheel</b> is developed to generate internal cooling effect. The internal cooling technology is compared with traditional cooling conditions in the grinding experiments on TC 4 (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V). The results indicate that the self-inhaling internal cooling wheel can reduce the grinding surface temperature by 30 % or more, and the grinding efficiency doubles. Utilizing water-based semi-synthetic coolant, the segmented wheel with the self-inhaling structure can further reduce the grinding temperature by about 50 %...|$|R

50|$|Metal-bonded diamond tools: The tools' bonding {{material}} is metal mixture powder. The functional {{parts of the}} tool are usually diamond segments. These tools include metal-bonded diamond saw blades, diamond grinding <b>cup</b> <b>wheels,</b> diamond core drill bits, etc. For metal-bonded diamond tools, the bond {{is one of the}} prime factors when selecting which tool to use for cutting or grinding a specific material, depending on how hard or abrasive the material is. The bond used dictates {{the rate at which the}} metallic powders wear down and expose new diamond crystals at the surface, thereby maintaining an abrasive cutting surface. Different bond strengths are achieved by the alloy mix of metallic powders chosen and how much heat and pressure are applied to the sintered segment.|$|R

40|$|A loose {{abrasive}} lapping {{technology was}} developed for truing and dressing ultrafine diamond <b>cup</b> <b>wheels</b> for grinding spherical end faces of fibre optic connectors. The relative densities of exposed grits and grit pull-outs measured from wheel surfaces prepared using the loose abrasive lapping and the bonded abrasive dressing were compared. It {{was found that the}} lapping method with loose abrasives produced wheel surfaces with more exposed grits and less grit pull-outs, especially for finer grit size wheels. For dressing ultrafine grit size wheels, the particle size of the lapping paste should be smaller than the wheel grit size to achieve a better result. It is also found that the wheels dressed using the lapping method demonstrate an excellent grinding performance. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V [...] All rights reserved...|$|R

25|$|After a {{metal piece}} is ground to an initial finish, it is {{superfinished}} with a finer grit solid abrasive. The abrasive is oscillated or rotated while the workpiece is rotated {{in the opposite}} direction; these motions are what causes the cross-hatching. The geometry of the abrasive depends on the geometry of the workpiece surface; a stone (rectangular shape) is for cylindrical surfaces and <b>cups</b> and <b>wheels</b> are used for flat and spherical surfaces. A lubricant is used to minimize heat production, which can alter the metallurgical properties, and to carry away the swarf; kerosene is a common lubricant.|$|R
