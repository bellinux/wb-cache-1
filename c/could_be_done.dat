5|$|Hitler {{had noticed}} one {{potential}} {{flaw in the}} defences. The roofs were flat and unprotected; he demanded to know if a glider, such as the DFS 230, could land on them. Student replied that it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done,</b> but only by 12 aircraft and in daylight; this would deliver 80–90 paratroopers onto the target.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} to build a canal from Machar via Adar to the White Nile to increase the volume of water flowing to Northern Sudan and Egypt, which apparently <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> without major environmental impact, but political instability has prevented the project from starting.|$|E
5|$|NESCo {{also argued}} that they had chosen the site to protect the city's amenities, {{in that it was}} outside the city boundary, {{partially}} surrounded by higher ground, and in the lee of prevailing winds. They also said that much <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> architecturally to fit the station into its surroundings.|$|E

5|$|Rather {{than try}} to fit more guns onto a ship, it was {{possible}} to increase the power of each gun. This <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> by increasing either the calibre of the weapon and hence the weight of shell, or by lengthening the barrel to increase muzzle velocity. Either of these offered the chance to increase range and armour penetration.|$|E
5|$|In their 2002 book Myofascial Pain and Fibromyalgia: Trigger Point Management authors {{orthopedic}} surgeon Edward S. Rachlin and physical therapist Isabel Rachlin recommended {{use of the}} Magic Wand for self-treatment by patients with myalgia. They wrote that continued use of the Magic Wand on myofascial trigger points or tense areas of muscle could result in decreasing the amount of discomfort felt by patients. Rachlin and Rachlin suggested that such treatment <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> in one's residence outside of a clinical setting.|$|E
5|$|Thin {{sectioning}} was {{an early}} procedure used to analyse fossilised material contained in coal balls. The process required cutting a coal ball with a diamond saw, then flattening and polishing the thin section with an abrasive. It would be glued to a slide and placed under a petrographic microscope for examination. Although the process <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> with a machine, {{the large amount of}} time needed and the poor quality of samples produced by thin sectioning gave way to a more convenient method.|$|E

5|$|At its {{session of}} 23 November 2006, the {{planning}} {{committee of the}} city council charged its staff with examining how the Altes Stadthaus could be used for large-scale retail without damaging it as an architectural landmark. The report, which was presented at the end of December, recommended reuse of the already modified internal space housing the library, and creation of additional usable space up to a total of approximately 1600m². This <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> by lowering the floor to street level and modifying stairway areas without changing the external appearance of the building, which is characteristic of government buildings of the 1920s, particularly in its blocky ground floor. Changes to the upper floors, which remained largely in their original condition, were not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Collier {{applied to}} the Admiralty for the {{opportunity}} to clear his name, but this was not satisfied. Friends and relations had become increasingly concerned about his mental state as a result. His brother took the precaution of removing the razors from his home, but Collier appears to have smuggled one to his room, and used it to cut his own throat early in the morning on 24 March 1824. His servant who was sleeping in the same room immediately brought help, but nothing <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> and Collier died less than five minutes after inflicting the injury. The inquest later determined that 'The deceased destroyed himself, being in a state of temporary mental derangement.' The baronetcy became extinct upon his death.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the best}} interdiction efforts of Rolling Thunder, however, the NLF and PAVN {{launched}} their largest offensive thus {{far in the}} war on 30 January 1968, striking throughout South Vietnam during the lunar new year holiday. The Tet Offensive concluded as a military disaster for North Vietnam and its NLF allies, but it also adversely affected U.S. public opinion, which in turn affected the will of Washington. Fortunately for North Vietnam, many U.S. bombing advocates (including Air Force Chief of Staff McConnell) did not want to risk the one aircraft capable of delivering a lot of bombs in bad weather – the B-52. Without them, there was little that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> over the north in response to Tet, since bad weather minimized fighter operations until the beginning of April.|$|E

5|$|Elephant Island was remote, uninhabited, {{and rarely}} visited by whalers {{or any other}} ships. If the party was to return to civilization it would be {{necessary}} to summon help. The only realistic way this <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> was to adapt one of the lifeboats for an 800-mile (1,300km) voyage across the Southern Ocean, to South Georgia. Shackleton had abandoned thoughts of taking the party on the less dangerous journey to Deception Island, because of the poor physical condition of many of his party. Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands was closer than South Georgia, but could not be reached, as this would require sailing against the strong prevailing winds.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by {{the success}} he had {{achieved}} in Romania in 1940 {{with the help of}} his son-in-law, Berger had proposed to Himmler that the next recruiting sphere be the Volksdeutsche communities of Romania, Hungary and Yugoslavia, which together contained about 1.5 million ethnic Germans. Little <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> to further this proposal until mid-1941, by which time Yugoslavia had been overrun by the Axis, and Romania and Hungary had joined the pact. Immediately after the lightning-quick defeat of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Hausser was being pressed to accept Yugoslav Volksdeutsche into his renamed SS-Division-Reich, even before it was withdrawn to prepare for Operation Barbarossa. On his way back to Germany from Yugoslavia, Hausser had transited through Romania and gathered another 600 ethnic German volunteers who he smuggled out of the country.|$|E
5|$|Having {{lost all}} of its Bristol Blenheim night fighters in the raid of 16 August, Tangmere {{dispatched}} two Hurricanes from the Fighter Interception Unit (FIU) fitted with FIU airborne radar to test the device in action. RAF Coastal Command also joined in, and committed No. 235 Squadron RAF and its Bristol Blenheims. The defence was reliant on the 68 Spitfires and Hurricanes. The numerical standing meant a ratio of one RAF fighter to every four German fighters and bombers, or in other words, one British aircraft to every two German fighters. Even had the fighter controllers realised {{the strength of the}} raid, there was little that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done.</b> Other fighters were refuelling and rearming after the attacks on Kenley and Biggin Hill and would not be available.|$|E
50|$|Three issues {{must first}} {{be present in the}} affirmative case and are the {{building}} blocks of logically choosing to take any action (in policy debate or in everyday life).

What are the results of what we <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> now versus what we <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> (significance stock issue)? The last stock issue, topicality, is procedural and unique to debate as it concerns how germane the plan (specifically, plan text) is to the resolution (which isn't usually a restriction in contemporary, outside policy issues).|$|R

5|$|Having taken {{office in}} 1805, Shaw {{determined}} to re-establish the tradition whereby the Lord Mayor took precedence in public processions within the City of London over all except the reigning monarch, {{and took the}} opportunity of the funeral of Lord Nelson in 1806 to do so. According to one account, Shaw discussed the matter with the Prime Minister, Lord Liverpool, who was aware that the Prince Regent would be attending the funeral, but did not seem willing to take action. Shaw then offered to visit the King himself at Windsor Castle to resolve the matter, and Liverpool {{said that he would}} see what <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done.</b> By the following day, the Royal Warrant of Precedence had been granted, and Shaw duly led the procession.|$|E
5|$|However, wall {{construction}} continued {{regardless of}} court politics during this time. The Ordos walls underwent extension, elaboration, and repair {{well into the}} 16th century. Brick and stone started to replace tamped earth as the wall building material, because they offered better protection and durability. This change in material {{gave rise to a}} number of necessary accommodations with regard to logistics, and inevitably a drastic increase in costs. Instead of being able to draw on local resources, building projects now required brick-kilns, quarries, and transportation routes to deliver bricks to the work site. Also, masons had to be hired since the local peasantry proved inadequate for the level of sophistication that brick constructions required. Work that originally <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> by one man in a month with earth now required 100 men to do in stone.|$|E
5|$|Pinkerton, who in 1816 was the BFBS's {{representative}} in Moscow, had met that {{year with a}} community of Albanians in Vienna, then capital of the Austrian Empire. They assured him that a translation of the New Testament into Albanian was indeed possible. In {{a letter to his}} superiors at the BFBS, dated August 28, 1816, Pinkerton wrote that the Albanian nation occupied {{a large part of the}} ancient Illyria, that they spoke a language completely different from Slavic, Turkish, Greek, or Latin, and that for the Albanian Orthodox the mass was recited in Greek, a language that believers and even some of the priests did not understand. According to Pinkerton, the translation <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> by one or more Albanians from the Ionian islands under the supervision of an Albanian bishop.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Bardia {{brought to}} the fore the {{simmering}} hostility between regular officers and reservists. Frank Berryman, the 6th Division's General Staff Officer (Grade 1), and Alan Vasey, the Deputy Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster General (DA), were eager for Robertson to do well and show that Staff Corps officers could make good commanders, and if that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> {{at the expense of}} an old-style reservist like Stanley Savige, so much the better. They pushed for Robertson's 19th Infantry Brigade, then in reserve, to be committed when the attack by Savige's 17th Infantry Brigade slowed down. The abrupt manner in which this was done generated antipathy between Robertson and Savige.|$|E
5|$|The {{inspiration}} for Nemo sprang from multiple experiences, {{going back to}} director Andrew Stanton's childhood, when he loved going to the dentist to see the fish tank, assuming that the fish were from the ocean and wanted to go home. In 1992, shortly after his son was born, {{he and his family}} took a trip to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom (which was called Marine World at the time). There, after seeing the shark tube and various exhibits, he felt that the underwater world <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> beautifully in computer animation. Later, in 1997, he took his son for a walk in the park, but realized that he was overprotecting him and lost an opportunity to have a father-son experience that day.|$|E
5|$|The {{sponsorship}} of Boit and Bitok consisted of $200,000, {{to cover their}} training, accommodation and equipment while in Finland. The logic had been that since Nike sent Finnish runners were sent to Kenya to train, then the same <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> in reverse. Following their training, both athletes tried {{to qualify for the}} Winter Olympics, but failed to do so. Instead, Kenya opted to use a single automatic qualification spot to send Boit to the Games in 1998. Shortly prior to the Games, Boit missed two weeks of training when he was hospitalised with a stomach problem.|$|E
