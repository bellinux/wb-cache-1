40|$|Abstract: Multidisciplinary design {{optimization}} (MDO) for a suspension {{component of the}} vehicle front suspension was performed in this research. Shapes and thicknesses of the subframe were optimized to satisfy multi-disciplinary design requirements; weight, fatigue, <b>crash,</b> <b>noise,</b> vibration, and harshness (NVH), and kinematic and compliance (K&C). Analyses procedures of the performance disciplines were integrated and automated by using the process integration and {{design optimization}} (PIDO) technique, and the integrated and automated analyses environments enabled various types of analytic design methodologies for solving the MDO problem. We applied an approximate optimization technique which involves sequential sampling and metamodeling. Since the design variables for thicknesses should be dealt as discrete variables. the evolutionary algorithm is selected as optimization technique. The MDO problem was formulated three types of problems according {{to the order of}} priorities among the performance disciplines, and the results of MDO provided design alternatives for various design situations...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Gallilee {{had another}} {{appropriate}} remark ready on her lips, when the unlucky dog interrupted her once more. He made a sudden rush into the conservatory, barking {{with all his}} might. A <b>crashing</b> <b>noise</b> followed the dog's outbreak, which sounded like the fall of a flower-pot.|$|R
60|$|Here {{everything}} was {{obscured by the}} black smoke, and {{he could no longer}} see Dunton, although now and then a <b>crashing</b> <b>noise</b> as of wood being splintered under heavy blows told, as he believed, that the brave fireman was intent on the effort to save life even though his own might pay the forfeit.|$|R
50|$|Initially the Coast Guard {{reported}} that the ship developed generator problems {{as soon as she}} left for Iloilo. According to Coast Guard chief Admiral Wilfredo Tamayo, initial reports said that the generator of SuperFerry 9 fluctuated several times. Passengers had reported loud heavy <b>crashing</b> <b>noises</b> and suggested cargo containers had moved in the hold damaging the hull.|$|R
50|$|The chase, {{depicted}} as the wildest car chase {{in the history}} of the Olsenbanden-movies, ends outside Bislett Stadium, after driving in circles around a traffic island for a minute, when the tram suddenly shows up. The police car slams his brakes, and the camera shifts away and follows the tram, while subsequent <b>crash</b> <b>noises</b> can be heard in the background.|$|R
60|$|At {{this point}} of the reporter's story {{there is a certain}} vagueness, but it can be {{gathered}} that there was a loud <b>crashing</b> <b>noise</b> {{at the rear of the}} house they were in. General Ludlow buttoned his coat closely and sprang for the door. But the reporter clutched him firmly with one hand, while he held the decanter with the other.|$|R
5000|$|Because AM assumes {{short term}} {{changes in the}} {{amplitude}} to be information, any electrical impulse will be picked up and demodulated along with the desired carrier. Hence lightning causes <b>crashing</b> <b>noises</b> when picked up by an AM radio near a storm. In contrast, FM suppresses short term changes in amplitude and is therefore much less prone to noise during storms and during reception of electrical noise impulses.|$|R
60|$|As the Captain and Oliver traversed {{this part}} of the mine they had {{occasionally}} to squeeze past small iron trucks which stood below holes in the sides of the level, down which ever and anon masses of ore and debris came from the workings above with a hard <b>crashing</b> <b>noise.</b> The ore was rich with tin, but the metal was invisible to any but trained eyes. To Oliver Trembath the whole stuff appeared like wet rubbish.|$|R
500|$|Both Resident Evil and {{the sequel}} appear on Roger Ebert's most hated films list, {{published}} in 2005. In his review, Ebert describes Resident Evil as a zombie movie {{set in the}} 21st century, where [...] "large metallic objects make <b>crashing</b> <b>noises</b> just by being looked at", and he criticizes the dialogue for being a series of commands and explanations with no [...] "small talk". The New York Times' Stephen Holden awarded Resident Evil 1.5 stars out of 5 saying that [...] "it has a frantic staccato that is more game-oriented than cinematic".|$|R
50|$|In a {{flashback}} of Susan’s {{about the day}} on which Katherine abruptly left Wisteria Lane, former neighbor Mary Alice Young and Susan walk up to Katherine’s house questioning a younger looking Katherine as to why she and Dylan are suddenly moving. A very nervous-looking Katherine tells them that she {{got a job in}} Chicago and she refuses to let Susan get Julie to say goodbye to Dylan. A <b>crashing</b> <b>noise</b> is heard upstairs and Katherine tells them she is really going to miss them and urgently shuts the door.|$|R

60|$|Another {{instant and}} we were all lying in a heap on the cabin floor with poor Tommy on top of us. The cyclone had struck the ship! Above the wash of water and the {{screaming}} of the gale we heard other mysterious sounds, which doubtless were caused by the yards hitting the seas, for the yacht was lying on her side. I thought that all was over, but presently there came a rending, <b>crashing</b> <b>noise.</b> The masts, or one of them, had gone, and by degrees we righted.|$|R

50|$|Russell's {{family and}} friends {{gathered}} at the Portland airport to await his arrival in patchy heavy fog. The airport officially closed at 1635 because of the fog. Six minutes later, his family reportedly heard Russell's voice requesting landing instructions on the airport radio, and saw his A-26B-5 Invader appear briefly out of the fog at an estimated altitude of 200 feet. The airport instructed Russell to climb to 1500 feet, and the plane disappeared into the fog. Waiting for a radio response from Russell, airport observers saw flames and heard <b>crash</b> <b>noises</b> from {{the direction in which}} the plane had disappeared.|$|R
5000|$|The car re-enters the {{interior}} through {{a set of}} double doors; these doors in particular have become plagued with a rider tradition of placing used chewing gum on the doors. They are usually covered in gum, giving them the nickname of [...] "The Gum Doors") The cars enter the main location of the ghost ship additions. While the majority of these stunts are gone now, the backdrops and parts to the stunts are still strewn about. The cars pass by a mummy, a group of skeletons and a moving coffin which makes loud <b>crashing</b> <b>noises</b> as it tips back and forth.|$|R
5000|$|A carfree city or car free {{city is a}} {{population}} center that relies primarily on public transport, walking, or cycling for transport within the urban area. Carfree cities greatly reduce petroleum dependency, air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, automobile <b>crashes,</b> <b>noise</b> pollution, and traffic congestion. Some cities have one or more districts where motorized vehicles are prohibited, referred to as car-free zones. Many older cities in Europe, Asia, and Africa were founded centuries {{before the advent of}} the automobile, and some continue to have carfree areas in the oldest parts of the city -- especially in areas where it is impossible for cars to fit, e.g. in narrow alleys.|$|R
50|$|The next morning, Jenny {{is again}} babysitting Eli. Before his mother leaves for the day, Jenny {{explains}} {{what happened and}} they both go to confront Eli. He denies making any practical joke and seems very insulted and mad. He proves this by showing his tarantula cage. All three tarantulas are present. Jenny is still unsure, so Eli then throws a crying tantrum. Downstairs a few minutes later, Jenny hears a <b>crashing</b> <b>noise</b> from upstairs. She runs up to Eli's room and finds it in complete disarray. Eli, who is near death, is lying on the carpet motionless, staring up blankly, with a puddle of blood under his head. As it turns out, that was practical joke too.|$|R
60|$|At {{that instant}} a <b>crashing,</b> rending <b>noise</b> as of an {{explosion}} sounded high above the din, {{and one of the}} iron shutters which the men had been trying to force open was hurled from its fastenings and thrown outward into the street, falling within half a dozen feet of where Davis was busy with his horses.|$|R
50|$|The skipper {{then comes}} {{up with the idea}} to try to hide the tour boat in a nearby {{boathouse}} and wait for Chief Brody's arrival. As the skipper brings the tour boat to a stop inside the boathouse and looks for somewhere to tie it up, a sound is heard somewhere near the back of the boathouse. As the stressed skipper tries {{to figure out what it}} was, a loud <b>crashing</b> <b>noise</b> breaks the silence as the walls of the boathouse begin to shake. The skipper realizes that the shark is ramming itself into the outside of the boathouse trying to break in. The skipper tries to drive off, but is unable to get the tour boat to drop into gear. After several seconds of fighting with the tour boat's throttle, the skipper finally gets it to drop into gear just as the shark finally breaks a hole through the wall and surfaces inside of the boathouse, grazing the side of the tour boat.|$|R
50|$|They then {{unlock the}} door; as Tom opens it, both Jerry and Jumbo whack {{him with a}} hammer. Tom, puzzled, peeks inside, but {{instantly}} shuts the door when he sees Jumbo. Tom grabs a baseball bat, looking to beat up Jumbo, but instead gets whacked by Jerry again. Losing his temper, Tom pulls {{the door open and}} charges in, bat at the ready, only to run into Jumbo, who faces him down and punches Tom with his trunk, hurling the cat across the room and into a desk. Tom then returns to the door and opens it for a fifth time, taking shelter behind it, but finds that nothing happens. Tom then hears a <b>crashing</b> <b>noise</b> and chases Jerry. As Tom runs back and forth, he sees Jumbo on the other side. Tom runs across a second time and sees Jerry, much to his relief, but after running across four times, he sees both Jerry and Jumbo.|$|R

5000|$|After {{discussing}} numerous Chinese {{accounts of}} the shanxiao, Eberhard concludes The concept of the shan-hsiao, very common among Miao tribes in present-day Kuichou existed only in South China from Yünnan to Chekiang since early times. The belief seems to have originated in the west because the older sources emphasized that the shan-hsiao lived in the western mountains. Their characteristics were: being one-legged and of short stature, similar to monkeys, living in trees, being afraid of <b>crashing</b> <b>noises</b> but loving music, being more like an imp or good-natured goblin than truly malicious. In my opinion the descriptions leave no room for doubt that these goblins hung together with monkeys, just like the mu-k'o [...] "tree guest". The original carriers of these stories {{seem to have been}} Yao peoples, because only Yao were distributed over this whole area. There seems to be some indication that the shan-hsiao were a kind of spirit of the dead. (1968:57) ...|$|R
5000|$|We {{liked that}} airplane, and found {{almost nothing to}} pick at. However, owners soon {{discovered}} to their horror that it didn't fly or land exactly like a strutless Skyhawk, and some heavy-handed Super-Car drivers managed to smash the Cardinal tail into the pavement on landing, knock-off a few nose-wheels, etc. (apparently, this was possible if one closed his eyes, used full back-pressure on the wheel at the flare and then sat rigidly waiting for the <b>crashing</b> <b>noises</b> to subside). Cessna accepted the blame gracefully. That was proper because, after all, they had lulled a generation of Cessna pilots into near-effortless flying with the extremely forgiving 172 series, and it probably wasn't ethical to suddenly offer, to many of those same customers, a Cessna that didn't handle exactly like a Cessna. The company therefore picked {{up the tab for}} a list of modifications that gentled the Cardinal and returned the smiles to the faces of dealers and customers.|$|R
6000|$|And now {{was heard}} {{coming over the}} water a terrible <b>crashing</b> <b>noise,</b> that made the banks {{on either side of}} it tremble. It was like a {{hurricane}} which comes roaring through the vain shelter of the woods, splitting and hurling away the boughs, sweeping along proudly in a huge cloud of dust, and making herds and herdsmen fly before it. [...] "Now stretch your eyesight across the water," [...] said Virgil, letting loose his hands;--"there, where the smoke of the foam is thickest." [...] Dante looked; and saw a thousand of the rebel angels, like frogs before a serpent, swept away into a heap before the coming of a single spirit, who flew over the tops of the billows with unwet feet. The spirit frequently pushed the gross air from before his face, as if tired of the base obstacle; and as he came nearer, Dante, who saw it was a messenger from heaven, looked anxiously at Virgil. Virgil motioned him to be silent and bow down.|$|R
50|$|The speed dropped {{progressively}} from 160 kn during lift-off, {{to stall}} speed {{at the end}} of the recording. In fact, about ten seconds before the <b>crash,</b> the <b>noise</b> of the stick shaker is heard on the CVR (which usually indicates that the airplane is 7% from its stall speed). The aural warning, which normally indicates a radar altitude below 200 ft, appeared about six seconds before the end of the recording.|$|R
60|$|Wishing to {{see what}} fishes were in the river there, we cast our lines over the wet bushes on the shore, but they were {{repeatedly}} swept down the swift stream in vain. So, leaving the Indian, we took the canoe, just before dark, and dropped down the river a few rods to fish {{at the mouth of}} a sluggish brook. We pushed up this a rod or two, but were soon driven off by the mosquitoes. While there we heard the Indian fire his gun twice in rapid succession. His object was to clean out and dry it after the rain, and he then loaded it with ball, being now on ground where he expected to meet with large game. This sudden loud <b>crashing</b> <b>noise</b> in the still aisles of the forest affected me like an insult to nature, or ill manners at any rate, as if you were to fire a gun in a hall or temple. It was not heard far, however, except along the river, the sound being rapidly hushed up or absorbed by the damp trees and mossy ground.|$|R
5|$|This day a {{dense fog}} {{obscured}} everything. Things a foot away {{could not be}} made out. Towards evening, rain streamed down heavily, abating somewhat with night. The frightening waves were like mountains. They would lift the ship up into the blue sky and then drop it as if down an abyss. They billowed and <b>crashed,</b> the <b>noise</b> splitting heaven from earth. We might all be drowned and left to rot at any moment.|$|R

60|$|Would {{they move}} now? Would they retire? Yes. The officer was giving the last lightning-rapid orders to fire before withdrawing. A shell passed unnoticed in the rapidity of action. And then, into the silence, into the {{suspense}} where the soul brooded, finally <b>crashed</b> a <b>noise</b> and a darkness and a moment's flaming agony and horror. Ah, {{he had seen}} the dark bird flying towards him, flying home this time. In one instant life and eternity went up in a conflagration of agony, then there was a weight of darkness.|$|R
50|$|Kirito {{appeared}} {{into the}} world of rock {{for the first time in}} 1990, with the obscure visual kei group <b>Crash</b> and <b>Noise.</b> He then went on to join Dizy-Lizy in early 1992. The first line-up of Dizy-Lizy was Hidelow on vocals, Kirito (then going by his real name, Shinya) and Jun on guitar, Kohta on bass and Luka on drums. After the group changed its name to Pierrot, Hidelow and Luka left, while Takeo and Aiji joined creating its final line-up of; Kirito on vocals, Jun and Aiji on guitar, Kohta on bass and Takeo on drums.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was wounded}} during the Battle of Gettysburg when his horse {{was shot and}} killed from under him. Fernández Cavada kept a diary during the war which is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most vivid and articulate accounts of the Battle of Gettysburg. His eyewitness account of the famous conflict provided an expressively descriptive account of the battle. During one day of the July battle, he recorded how [...] "The air was soon full of flying shot, shell and canister--and a groan here and there attested their affect. ...the roar of musketry and the <b>crashing,</b> pounding <b>noise</b> of guns and bursting shells was deafening..." ...|$|R
60|$|Still he squatted on his heels, rubbing {{dirt from}} gold and debating in just what manner he should rise up. He might rise {{up with a}} rush and claw {{his way out of}} the hole to meet {{whatever}} threatened on the even footing above ground. Or he might rise up slowly and carelessly, and feign casually to discover the thing that breathed at his back. His instinct and every fighting fibre of his body favored the mad, clawing rush to the surface. His intellect, and the craft thereof, favored the slow and cautious meeting with the thing that menaced and which he could not see. And while he debated, a loud, <b>crashing</b> <b>noise</b> burst on his ear. At the same instant he received a stunning blow on the left side of the back, and from the point of impact felt a rush of flame through his flesh. He sprang up in the air, but halfway to his feet collapsed. His body crumpled in like a leaf withered in sudden heat, and he came down, his chest across his pan of gold, his face in the dirt and rock, his legs tangled and twisted because of the restricted space at the bottom of the hole. His legs twitched convulsively several times. His body was shaken as with a mighty ague. There was a slow expansion of the lungs, accompanied by a deep sigh. Then the air was slowly, very slowly, exhaled, and his body as slowly flattened itself down into inertness.|$|R

It came, for there was a <b>crash,</b> and a <b>noise</b> of branches breaking. The steamer rolled, recoiled, and forged on into the forest.|$|R
30|$|The {{positive}} transformants were cultured for 24  h at 30  °C in ZYM- 5052 auto-inducing media (300  mL in the 1  L shaking flask, 100  μg/mL kanamycin) (Studier 2005; Guan et al. 2015). The positive transformant was cultured in LB medium on {{a platform}} shaker (37  °C, 250  rpm) to an optical density at 600  nm (OD 600 nm) of 0.4 – 0.6.
