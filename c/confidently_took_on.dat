Upon arriving at a local studio to record Autumn on the Radio, band members realized the studio did not employ an in-house engineer. With no experience, Worsley <b>confidently</b> <b>took</b> <b>on</b> the recording duties and instantly fell in love with it. [...] He then went on to play with the Seattle, Washington based band The Pale Pacific and Vancouver band Dawntreader. After a brief stint in Paper Moon, Worsley produced, recorded and mixed their 2009 release [...] "Only During Thunderstorms".|$|E

In their earlier married life she would have <b>confidently</b> <b>taken</b> the initiative <b>on</b> all moral questions. She still believed that she was better fitted for their decision by her Puritan tradition and her New England birth, but once in a great crisis when it seemed a question of their living, she had weakened before it, and he, with no such advantages, had somehow met the issue with courage and conscience. She could not believe he did so by inspiration, but she had since let him take the brunt of all such issues and the responsibility. He made no reply, and she said: [...] "I suppose you'll admit now there was always something peculiar in the poor boy's manner to Stoller." ...|$|R
40|$|The Centre for Australian Languages and Linguistics (CALL) at Batchelor Institute of Indigenous Tertiary Education (BIITE) has {{developed}} Certificates I and II in Own Language Work {{to assist in}} building capacity in remote Indigenous communities to maintain, strengthen and preserve Indigenous languages. The courses provide training in language worker skills including vernacular literacy development, audio and visual recording, language analysis, transcribing and translating, language management and planning, language teaching skills and resource development. We take a project-based, interdisciplinary approach to course delivery, responding specifically to community needs and aspirations. In so doing, the foundations for community-based documentation initiatives are laid. In late 2007, a group of older women from Utopia, a remote Aboriginal communtiy in Central Australia, requested support to document bush medicine knowledge. The women wanted to create opportunities for ‘old people’ and young people to come together to ‘record stories and write them down’. In response to this request, lecturers for Certificates in Own Language Work, Certificates in Visual Arts and Contemporary Crafts and youth media trainers have been collaborating with the community, drawing on existing strengths: oral language competence, elders’ traditional knowledge and visual art practices, to establish a community driven documentation process. Key factors of the process are: • to engage youth to research and document local knowledge of bush medicine and, • {{to encourage them to}} express and respond to this knowledge through contemporary visual art, multimedia and the Alyawarr and Anmatyerr languages. Critical to the success of this project is the creation and maintenance of a space that allows for self-directed, creative and culturally meaningful activity for youth, to afford them the opportunity to <b>confidently</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> the role of mediating between old knowledges and digital technologies. This paper will report on the effectiveness of combining youth, media and art practices with respect to cultural knowledge preservation and language documentation. The discussion will consider factors including: successful youth engagement, the benefits of a collaborative approach to intergenerational knowledge transfer, the range and effectiveness of artefacts produced, reactions from youth and elders, and the acquisiton of new skills and roles...|$|R

It is an experience of Gontor Modern Integrated Islamic Institution to maintain its existence through the activities of Waqf Enlargement. The spirit of self-reliance which has been implemented by Gontor through various economic enterprise activities inside the campus is the total processes of educational activities, carried out by students and teachers themselves. They act as the subjects and objects of the education at the same time. They teach themselves through various activities, creativities and social interaction for their character and personality building. This learning process is purposely undertaken in Gontor, because the basic principle of this system is to actualize the community orientation through which {{the students in the}} campus guided and prepared to have a spirit of self reliance.

5000|$|When his {{sickness}} {{returned in}} September, Darwin had a day visit to Malvern, then recuperated at home. In June 1850 after losing time to illness (without vomiting) {{he spent a}} week at Malvern. Later that year he wrote to Fox about the credulity of his [...] "beloved Dr Gully" [...] whose daughter had been ill, and had treated her with a clairvoyant girl to report on internal changes, a mesmerist to put her to sleep, John Chapman as homœopathist and himself as hydropathist, after which Gully's daughter recovered. Darwin explained to Fox his wrathful scepticism about clairvoyance and homeopathy. When Darwin's own young daughter Annie had persistent indigestion he <b>confidently</b> <b>took</b> her to Gully on 24 March 1851, and after a week left her there to take the cure, but a fortnight later was recalled by Dr Gully as Annie had bilious fever. Dr. Gully was attentive and repeatedly reassured them that she was recovering, but {{after a series of}} crises Annie died on 23 April.

60|$|The {{first three}} {{volumes of the}} Positive Philosophy contain an {{exposition}} of the partial philosophies of the five sciences that precede sociology in the hierarchy. Their value has usually been placed very low by the special followers of the sciences concerned; {{they say that the}} knowledge is second-hand, is not coherent, and is too <b>confidently</b> <b>taken</b> for final. The Comtist replies that the task is philosophic, and is not to be judged by the minute accuracies of science. In these three volumes Comte took the sciences roughly as he found them. His eminence as a man of science must be measured by his only original work in that department,--the construction, namely, of the new science of society. This work is accomplished in the last three volumes of the Positive Philosophy and the second and third volumes of the Positive Polity. The Comtist maintains that even if these five volumes together fail in laying down correctly and finally the lines of the new science, still they are the first solution of a great problem hitherto unattempted. 'Modern biology has got beyond Aristotle's conception; but {{in the construction of the}} biological science, not even the most unphilosophical biologist would fail to recognise the value of Aristotle's attempt. So for sociology. Subsequent sociologists may have conceivably to remodel the whole science, yet not the less will they recognise the merit of the first work which has facilitated their labours' (Congreve).|$|R
40|$|Currently, seismic {{design of}} new European {{buildings}} follows a force-based approach, whilst {{the assessment of}} existing buildings is moving towards a displacement-based philosophy. In force-based design, conservative estimates of the period of vibration should be produced such that the base shear force will be conservatively predicted from an acceleration spectrum, and thus the use of gross section (uncracked) stiffness in analytical calculations is perhaps acceptable. For the assessment of buildings, {{the use of the}} uncracked stiffness in the determination of the period is certainly inappropriate considering cracking of critical elements such as beams generally occurs under gravity loading alone. Even if cracking is not found to have occurred before the design seismic level of excitation (considered unlikely as this level of excitation would with all probability have been preceded by a number of lower intensity events), it will occur early on in the response to excitation and thereafter the stiffness will reduce rapidly leading to the loss of the tension stiffening effect of the concrete. Thus, the reliable stiffness of the members of an existing RC frame can only be <b>confidently</b> <b>taken</b> as the yield/cracked stiffness. The uncracked and yield period of existing European reinforced concrete buildings of varying height is analytically calculated herein using eigenvalue analysis. A simplified equation is proposed to relate the yield period of vibration of existing buildings to their height for use in large-scale vulnerability assessment applications...|$|R
