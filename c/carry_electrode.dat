40|$|Infection {{is a major}} {{clinical}} problem {{associated with}} the use of intravenous catheters. The efficacy of a direct electric current (10 µA, 9 V) via electrode-conducting carbon impregnated catheters to prevent colonisation of catheters by micro-organisms was investigated. The range of organisms susceptible to 10 µA was determined by a zone of inhibition test. The catheters acting as the anode and the cathode were inserted into a nutrient agar plate inoculated with a lawn of bacteria. There was no zone of inhibition observed around the anode. Organisms susceptible to 10 µA at the cathode were Staphylococcus aureus (2 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (5 strains), Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (2 strains each), and one strain of the following micro-organisms: Staphylococcus hominis, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. The zones ranged from 6 to 16 mm in diameter according to the organisms under test. The zone size was proportional to the amperage (10 - 100 µA) and the number of organisms on the plate. Ten µA did not prevent adhesion of staphylococci to the cathode nor did it affect their growth in nutrient broth. However, it was bactericidal to adherent bacteria on the cathodal catheter and significantly reduced the number of bacteria on the catheter after 4 to 24 h application of electricity. The antimicrobial activity of low amperage electric current under anaerobic conditions and in the absence of chloride ions against bacteria attached to the surface of a current <b>carrying</b> <b>electrode</b> was also investigated. The mechanisms of the bactericidal activity associated with the cathode were investigated with S. epidermidis and S. aureus. The inhibition zone was greatly reduced in the presence of catalase. There was no zone around the cathode when the test was carried out under anaerobic conditions. Hydrogen peroxide was produced at the cathode surface under aerobic conditions, but not in the absence of oxygen. A salt-bridge apparatus was used to demonstrate further that hydrogen peroxide was produced at the cathode, and chlorine at the anode. The antimicrobial activity of low amperage electric current under anaerobic conditions and in the absence of chloride ions against bacteria attached to the surface of a current <b>carrying</b> <b>electrode</b> was also investigated. Antibacterial activity was reduced under anaerobic conditions, which is compatible with the role of hydrogen peroxide as a primary bactericidal agent of electricity associated with the cathode. A reduction in chloride ions did not significantly reduce the antibacterial activity suggesting chlorine plays only a minor role in the bactericidal activity against organisms attached to anodal electrode surfaces. The bactericidal activity of electric current associated with the cathode and H 202 was greatly reduced in the presence of 50 μM to 0. 5 mM magnesium ions in the test menstrum. Ten μA applied via the catheters did not prevent the initial biofilm growth by the adherent bacteria but reduced the number of bacteria in the biofilm by 2 log order aiter 24 h. The results suggested that 10 μA may prevent the colonisation of catheters by both the extra~ and intra-luminal routes. The localised production of hydrogen peroxide and chlorine and the intrinsic activity due to electric current may offer a useful method for the eradication of bacteria from catheter surfaces...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Radio-frequency (RF) {{catheter}} ablation {{has become}} the standard treatment of atrial fibrillation if pharmacotherapy fails. As an alternative to traditional RF standard ablation catheters, single-shot devices have received more and more interest. One group of these devices are cryo-balloon catheters. Such catheters are designed to electrically isolate a pulmonary vein (PV) {{with only a few}} applications, ideally only one. Whereas standard radio-frequency ablation catheters operate point by point, cryo-balloon devices need to be positioned antrally to the pulmonary vein ostium before freezing. If a good seal can be achieved far enough outside of the pulmonary veins, the cryo-balloon is an effective and safe ablation device. The catheters are inserted through a transseptal sheath and are inflated using liquid nitrogen. Single-shot devices, when used successfully, promise a reduction of procedure time and X-ray exposure. Single-shot devices based on ablation energies other than RF, may not <b>carry</b> <b>electrodes</b> or electromagnetic sensors. This makes it difficult to visualize them using standard EP mapping systems. As a result, fluoroscopic imaging is needed. Unfortunately, the inflated balloon may be difficult to see under X-ray. To improve this situation, we propose a new method that tracks and enhances the visualization of a cryo-balloon catheter under fluoroscopic imaging. The method involves a 2 -D template of the cryo-balloon that is manually initialized and then tracks the balloon device during live X-ray imaging. To improve visualization, a 2 -D ellipse is overlaid onto the fluoroscopic imaging to highlight the position of the balloon catheter. The tracking error was calculated as the distance between the tracked catheter template and the manually segmented catheter. Our method achieved 2 -D tracking error of 0. 60 mm± 0. 32 mm. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Electrical conduction properties of thin co-evaporated SiO/B 2 C 3 (borosilicate) films {{in the form of}} sandwich structures of M-SiO B 203 –M (diode) and M-SiOx/B 2 O 3 -N-SiOx/B 2 O 3 -M (triode) have been studied. Diode and triode systems show electroforming effects and subsequently electron emission, voltage-controlled negative resistance, electroluminescence, and switching phenomena. Previous work in this field is reviewed. By making certain modifications to the filamentary conduction theory of Dearnaley, the time dependence of the circulating current and electron emission may be explained. The theory is also supported by topographical studies 0 of the structures in a scanning electron microscope. The voltage breakdown strength in borosilicate glasses is found to be very high, in particular for devices which <b>carry</b> aluminium <b>electrodes</b> in comparison to those carry silver, copper or gold electrodes. Breakdown depends on both the electrode and insulating materials and on the insulator thickness. Since the circulating current in borosilicate films which <b>carry</b> noble metal <b>electrodes</b> such as Ag or Au, is much higher than those which <b>carry</b> reactive <b>electrode</b> materials such-ac Al, i. e. the device temperature is very high (400 - 700 oC), and these have led us to the conclusion that this type of breakdown in fact is at least partly thermal in origin. Experiments on triode systems yielded extremely interesting results such as dependence of potential distribution on the forming direction, non-uniformity of conducting filaments, and finally controllability of the circulating and emission currents by the grid voltage. The films deposited between Al electrodes, show evidence of electroforming and of electron emission. Formed devices also showed a region of differential negative resistance at high voltages. These devices could withstand high voltages and give improved emission efficiency. Diode and triode systems having thickness greater than 10, 000 R were formed. The effects of electrode materials, by using combinations of Al, Ag and Cu in triode electrodes were studied. Peak voltage and peak current showed a dependence on the electrode materials. Scanning electron microscope observations of films showed localised effects at the electrode surfaces and physical changes in the dielectric structure, while the sandwich structures were being operated as electron emitters. Consequently electroforming is believed more likely to take place 4 y means of the production of filaments of mostly electrode and insulator materials by diffusion and electrolytic processes.

40|$|It is {{a common}} {{experience}} in working with glass-microelectrodes that penetration of a cell is performed with greatest ease if a single thrust of high velocity is applied to either the electrode or the preparation.

Potentially, piezoelectric transducers are most suitable for these applications because of their high speed. Single elements, however, are hampered by the fact that only small excursions can be obtained at high voltages.
