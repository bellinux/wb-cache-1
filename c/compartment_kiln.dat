25|$|Compartment-type kilns {{are most}} {{commonly}} used in timber companies. A <b>compartment</b> <b>kiln</b> is filled with a static batch of timber through which air is circulated. In these types of kiln, the timber remains stationary. The drying conditions are successively varied according {{to the type of}} timber being dried. This drying method is well suited to the needs of timber companies, which have to dry timbers of varied species and thickness, including refractory hardwoods that are more liable than other species to check and split.|$|E
25|$|The {{successful}} {{control of}} drying defects in a drying process consists in maintaining {{a balance between}} the rate of evaporation of moisture from the surface and the rate of outward movement of moisture from the interior of the wood. The way in which drying can be controlled will now be explained. One of the most successful ways of wood drying or seasoning would be kiln drying, where the wood is placed into a <b>kiln</b> <b>compartment</b> in stacks and dried by steaming, and releasing the steam slowly.|$|R
