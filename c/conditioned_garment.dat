The aim {{of the current study}} was to examine the influence of compression garments on cardiovascular, thermoregulatory, metabolic and perceptual responses during intermittent anaerobic running and subsequent recovery. METHODS: Fifteen young, healthy adults volunteered for this study and provided written informed consent in line with institutional ethics approval. Participants completed three intermittent maximal anaerobic running power (MARP) tests while wearing, in a randomised order, no compression garments (CONTROL), a lower body compression garment (TIGHTS) or combined upper and lower body compression garments (SHIRT/TlGHTS). Heart rate (HR), core temperature (TC), lactate (La) and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were monitored during the MARP tests and the subsequent active (1 O mins) and passive (20 mins) recovery phases. Significant (p< 0. 05) differences over time and between <b>garment</b> <b>conditions</b> were determined by repeated measures ANOVA and Tukey's HSD post-hoc tests. RESULTS: During the MARP test, HR increased similarly for each <b>garment</b> <b>condition</b> with maximal values of HR, TC, La, RPE and performance not significantly different between <b>garment</b> <b>conditions.</b> However, TC overall was significantly greater for SHIRT/TlGHTS compared with TIGHTS during the MARP while greater RPE was exhibited for TIGHTS compared to CONTROL during the early stages of the MARP. During recovery, HR, RPE and La decreased similarly for each <b>garment</b> <b>condition.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Compression <b>garments</b> significantly altered thermoregulatory and perceptual responses without significant changes in anaerobic performance or recovery responses following intermittent anaerobic running...|$|R

Unsafe structural integrity and fire safety are the factors that cause workplace accidents. This research uses Pluralism Perspective and Role Concept. It also uses Organization theory and International Cooperation theory. These theories assume any cooperative arrangement instituted among states, usually by a basic agreement, to perform some mutually advantageous functions implemented trough periodic meetings and staff activities. In handling the workplace accidents in garment industry in Bangladesh, ILO cooperated with tripartite partners through joint statement and formulated an Action Plan as response to Rana Plaza tragedy.

When the air gap exceeds a certain value, thermal insulation and vapor resistance may decrease with increases in the air gap. Thermal insulation and moisture vapor resistance reach a maximum at a certain air gap thickness depending on fabric properties, wind <b>conditions,</b> and <b>garment</b> fit.

30|$|The social {{dimension}} of sustainability adds {{a sense of}} community to sustainable development in that it emphasizes cooperation and concern for others, which ultimately contributes to the well-being of a larger community (Edwards 2005). On a micro-level, social sustainability addresses how the product and its production processes affect people’s lives. On a macro-level, it relates to how society as a whole (e.g., human health, traditional culture) is impacted by type of business (Waage et al. 2005). In the fashion apparel industry, the social aspect of CCS often relates to fair trade and ethical sourcing practices during the manufacturing phase because human right issues such as sweatshops, child labor, and poor working conditions are particularly pervasive (Fulton and Lee 2013). The increasing manufacturing flexibility that is required in the current fashion industry has exacerbated working <b>conditions</b> in <b>garment</b> factories (Gardetti and Torres 2012).|$|R

40|$|Both {{the garment}} {{industry}} and the sex trade are highly globalised and feminised phenomena, no longer simply products of local factors, but increasingly determined by the global economy and the place of nations in a global market. The working conditions of women workers in the garment industry – like those of sex workers in many countries – are highly exploitative and are intertwined with women’s experiences of poverty and inequality. This article utilises data from qualitative research into sex work and HIV in Fiji showing that garment workers in Fiji have been undertaking sex work {{as a means of}} supplementing inadequate incomes, and that sex workers are using garment work as a stable supplement to the exigencies of the sex trade. Further, this data illustrates the manner in which Fiji’s economic positioning as a labour source in the production of global commodities not only underpins <b>conditions</b> of <b>garment</b> work in Fiji, but is also a structural factor that shapes both HIV and sexual health risk, and the vulnerability of garment and sex workers...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE To {{establish}} the thermal and performance effects of wearing a lower-body graduated compression garment (GCG) {{in a hot}} environment (35. 2 °C ± 0. 1 °C) with a representative radiant heat load (800 W/m²) {{in contrast to a}} control (running shorts) and sham <b>condition</b> (a compression <b>garment</b> 1 size larger than that recommended by the manufacturer), with the latter included to establish any placebo effect. METHOD Eight participants (mean ± SD; age 21 ± 2 y, height 1. 77 ± 0. 06 m, mass 72. 8 ± 7. 1 kg, surface area, 1. 89 ± 0. 10 m²) completed 3 treadmill tests at a fixed speed for 15 min followed by a self-paced 5 -km time trial. Performance (completion time) and pacing (split time), thermal responses (aural, skin, and mean body temperature, cardiac frequency), and perceptual responses (rating of perceived exertion [RPE], thermal sensation, thermal comfort) were measured. RESULTS Performance in the compression group was not different than in either sham or control at any stage (P >. 05); completion time 26. 08 ± 4. 08, 26. 05 ± 3. 27, and 25. 18 ± 3. 15 min, respectively. At the end of the 5 -km time trial, RPE was not different; it was 19 ± 1 across conditions. In general, thermal and perceptual responses were not different, although the radiant heat load increased site-specific skin temperature (quadriceps) in the <b>garment</b> <b>conditions.</b> CONCLUSION GCG did not enhance performance in a hot environment with a representative radiant heat load. The sham treatment did not benefit perception. GCG provided no evidence of performance enhancement...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the thermoregulatory response to, perceived comfort and moisture management properties of, base-layer garments during intermittent treadmill exercise in controlled laboratory conditions. Seven males performed an intermittent treadmill protocol whilst wearing a base-layer hot garment, base-layer cold garment, a 100 % cotton t-shirt and bare-chested. Environmental temperatures were 20. 6 °C ± 0. 2 SD (ambient temperature) and 47. 5 % ± 7. 7 SD (ambient humidity). Mean torso skin temperature, rectal temperature, comfort rating, thermal sensation rating, rating of perceived exertion, garment moisture retention, and garment rate of evaporation were recorded. Garments were examined under a high magnification microscope in order to characterise physical differences. Mean torso skin temperatures post exercise were 28. 5 °C ± 0. 8 SD, 29. 1 °C ± 0. 4 SD, 29. 8 °C ± 0. 8 SD, 29. 8 °C ± 0. 8 SD for bare-chested, base-layer hot, base-layer cold, and cotton <b>garment</b> <b>conditions</b> respectively. Mean comfort ratings during exercise were 7. 8 ± 0. 6 SD, 8. 1 ± 0. 7 SD, 9. 2 ± 0. 7 SD, and 9. 4 ± 0. 6 SD for bare-chested, base-layer hot, base-layer cold, and cotton <b>garment</b> exercise <b>conditions</b> respectively. Mean increase in garment mass post exercise was 0. 044 kg ± 0. 032 SD, 0. 052 kg ± 0. 029 SD, and 0. 066 kg ± 0. 043 SD for base-layer hot, base-layer cold, and cotton <b>garment</b> <b>conditions</b> respectively. In conclusion, base-layer garment choice affects the physiological response to intermittent treadmill exercise. Specialist base-layer garments are a superior alternative to 100 % cotton t-shirts with respect to desired thermoregulatory response and wearer comfort...|$|R
