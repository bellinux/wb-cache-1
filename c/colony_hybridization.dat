The treatment of colonies on nitrocellulose membrane filters with proteinase K and Triton X- 100 was essential for obtaining the specific hybridization.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Integrons are {{bacterial}} genetic elements, {{working as}} assembly platforms, by incorporating gene cassettes (GCs) in the bacterial genome. 130 GCs providing antimicrobial resistance to most classes of antibiotics have been described, {{and most of}} them are associated with the class 1 integrons. Class 1 integrons are widespread among clinically important Gram-negatives, but are rare in gram positives. Recently, the first detection of integrons in clinical isolates of enterococci was described. Over the last two decades enterococci has emerged as one of the leading causes to nosocomial infections world over, as a result of development of hospital adapted lineages. These lineages tend to possess genes encoding antimicrobial resistance and have increased virulence. It is therefore of great interest to search for integrons in enterococci, as acquisition of integrons in enterococci could lead to an even more critical situation in the treatment of enterococcal infection. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A diverse collection of 274 enterococcal isolates was screened by IntI 1 PCR which is a good marker for presence of class 1 integrons. Additionally, 24 of the isolates were further examined by <b>colony</b> blot <b>hybridization</b> and antibiotic susceptibility testing. RESULTS: All isolates were found to be PCR negative for the IntI 1 integrase. Two possible positive results were detected by <b>colony</b> blot <b>hybridization.</b> CONCLUSION: Presence of Class 1 integrons was not detected in the enterococci-isolate collection investigated. However, further investigation of two possible positive isolates is required to verify the results.

40|$|High-frequency RNA {{recombination}} {{has been}} proposed as an important mechanism for generating viral deletion variants of murine coronavirus. Indeed, a number of variants with deletions in the spike glycoprotein have been isolated from persistently infected animals. However, the significance of generating and potentially accumulating deletion variants in the persisting viral RNA population is unclear. To study this issue, we evaluated the evolution of spike variants by examining the population of spike RNA sequences detected in the brains and spinal cords of mice inoculated with coronavirus and sacrificed at 4, 42, or 100 days postinoculation. We focused on the S 1 hypervariable region since previous investigators had shown that this region is subject to recombination and deletion. RNA isolated from the brains or spinal cords of infected mice was rescued by reverse transcription-PCR, and the amplified products were cloned and used in differential <b>colony</b> <b>hybridizations</b> to identify individual isolates with deletions. We found that 11 of 20 persistently infected mice harbored spike deletion variants (SDVs), indicating that deletions are common but not required for persistent infection.

Furthermore, we found that each mouse harbored distinct variants in its central nervous system (CNS), suggesting that SDVs are generated during viral replication in the CNS. Interestingly, mice with the most severe and persisting neurological disease harbored the most prevalent and diverse quasispecies of SDVs.

Urinary tract isolates differed from fecal isolates by a low incidence of type 1 adhesin expression among pil probe-positive isolates. hly-related sequences were only detected in pap probe-positive isolates.
