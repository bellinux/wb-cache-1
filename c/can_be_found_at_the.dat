5|$|Bajar Dengan Djiwa was {{screened}} {{as late as}} October 1943, but is now likely lost.

5|$|Captive lemur {{populations are}} {{maintained}} locally {{and outside of}} Madagascar in many zoos, although the diversity of species is limited. Sikafas, for instance, do not survive well in captivity, so few facilities have them. The largest captive lemur population <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Duke Lemur Center (DLC), whose mission includes non-invasive research, conservation (e.g. captive breeding), and public education. Another large lemur colony the Myakka City Lemur Reserve run by the Lemur Conservation Foundation (LCF), which also hosts lemur research. In Madagascar, Lemurs' Park is a free-range, private facility southwest of Antananarivo that exhibits lemurs for the public while also rehabilitating captive-born lemurs for reintroduction into the wild.|$|E

5|$|The minor inmates at the Castellania {{were the}} ones who took care of the general maintenance, {{cleaning}} and repair works of the building, while guards were responsible for the allocation of tasks and observing their performance.

At the underground are the dungeons, which are described as an unpleasant place to stay. By the early 19th century, arrested females awaiting a court decision started to be sent to the women prison at Corradino (now a police station) rather than accommodated at the Castellania.|$|E

5|$|The {{still largely}} unexplained tectonic {{causes of the}} {{volcanism}} that has produced the Silverthrone Caldera are a matter of ongoing research. Silverthrone is not above a hotspot as are Nazko or Hawaii.

At issue are the current plate configuration and rate of subduction but Silverthrone's chemistry indicates that Silverthrone is subduction related.|$|E
