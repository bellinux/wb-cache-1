40|$|The {{increasing}} use {{of civil}} unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) {{has the potential to}} threaten public safety and privacy. Therefore, airspace administrators urgently need an effective method to regulate UAVs. Understanding the meaning and format of UAV flight <b>control</b> <b>commands</b> by automatic protocol reverse-engineering techniques is highly beneficial to UAV regulation. To improve our understanding of the meaning and format of UAV flight <b>control</b> <b>commands,</b> this paper proposes a method to automatically analyze the private flight control protocols of UAVs. First, we classify flight <b>control</b> <b>commands</b> collected from a binary network trace into clusters; then, we analyze the meaning of flight <b>control</b> <b>commands</b> by the accumulated error of each cluster; next, we extract the binary format of commands and infer field semantics in these commands; and finally, we infer the location of the check field in command and the generator polynomial matrix. The proposed approach is validated via experiments on a widely used consumer UAV...|$|R
25|$|In 1992, the {{predecessor}} to the ASCC - Radar Data Supply Department {{was part of}} the Aviation Service under the command of Lt. Col. V. Pacevičius. On April 27, 1992, military personnel initiated the surveillance of the Lithuanian airspace in Vilnius Airport. That day marked the beginning of continuous Lithuanian air space monitoring and is considered to be the founding day of the Air Surveillance and <b>Control</b> <b>Command.</b>|$|E

Three types of maps are featured: {{domination}} maps, where players must <b>control</b> <b>command</b> points to win the game, assault maps, where one team defends a series of command points which the other teams assaults, and tug of war maps, where teams must fight to capture a series of command points on the front line, whereupon the line shifts towards {{a new set of}} points closer to the losing team. One side plays as either the United States or NATO, while the other as the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|From 1980 to 1984, {{the command}} {{structure}} was reorganised. Instead of {{units of the}} separate Strike Command, Transportation Command SAAF, and Maritime Air Command SAAF often being based at the same base but responsible to different chains of command, regional commands were established. Main Threat Air Command (MTAC) was made responsible for the northern half of the country, and Southern Air Command SAAF and Western Air Command SAAF for those areas. MTAC was co-located with the Air Force Command Post at Pretoria, with 20 subordinate squadrons (8 reserve). Southern Air Command at Silvermine was allocated nine squadrons (three reserve), based at AFS Port Elizabeth, Cape Town Airport, and AFB Ysterplaat, including 16 Squadron SAAF (Alouettes), 25 Squadron flying Dakotas frpom Ysterplaat, 27 Squadron SAAF (Piaggio 166), 35 Squadron SAAF (Avro Shackleton), and 88 Maritime Training School. Western Air Command at Windhoek relied on aircraft temporarily detached from MTAC and SAC. Airspace <b>Control</b> <b>Command,</b> Training Command and Air Logistics Command remained largely unchanged.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} a probabilistic {{model of a}} pursuit-evasion game on Rn, in which neither pursuer nor evader positions are known with certainty. Both parties are represented by normal distributions that evolve according to a Kalman filter as new sensor readings (observation from overhead camera/satellite images) are obtained. The objective is to design the <b>control</b> <b>commands</b> issued by the pursuer (which is executed noisily). The <b>control</b> <b>commands</b> issued by the evader are unknown – only sensor measurements are given. Even with such limited knowledge we prove boundedness of a distance between the pursuer’s distribution and the evader’s true distribution (one {{that takes into account}} the evader’s <b>control</b> <b>commands).</b> Our simulation results support the claimed guarantees.

500|$|The {{designers}} of dreadnoughts sought to provide as much protection, speed, and firepower {{as possible in}} a ship of a realistic size and cost. The hallmark of dreadnought battleships was an [...] "all-big-gun" [...] armament, but they also had heavy armour concentrated mainly in a thick belt at the waterline and {{in one or more}} armoured decks.

2500|$|The Airspace Surveillance and <b>Control</b> <b>Command</b> (ASCC) is {{a branch}} of the Lithuanian Air Force {{responsible}} for surveillance and control the airspace of Lithuania. While implementing reesolutions of the Parliament of the Republic of Lithuania concerning Principal Structure of the Lithuanian Armed Forces and Armed Forces’ development plans, the Lithuanian military have expanded and increased defence capabilities. Therefore, the Air Surveillance and <b>Control</b> <b>Command</b> has also evolved. Presently, five radar posts have been established to monitor Lithuanian air space.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} concept behind {{train operation}} control in strong wind {{is to compare}} aerodynamic force acting on the train body due to wind and overturn resistance—ability of rolling stock to resist overturning—and secure train operation in conditions where overturn resistance exceeds aerodynamic force. In order to appropriately issue operation <b>control</b> <b>commands,</b> {{it is important to}} appropriately recognize the peak value of the aerodynamic force acting on the train body. It is, however, technically difficult to measure the aerodynamic force on the trains in service. Thus, railway operators actually use a method of estimating aerodynamic force from wind speed values, issuing train operation <b>control</b> <b>commands</b> in strong winds based on those wind speeds. After the overturning of a train on the Uetsu Line on December 25, 2005, JR East provisionally reduced the standard wind speeds for issuing <b>control</b> <b>commands</b> as one measure against stron...|$|R

40|$|A multi-objective {{search method}} is adapted for {{supporting}} structural control {{of an active}} tensegrity structure. Structural control is carried out by modifying the self-stress {{state of the structure}} in order to satisfy a serviceability objective and additional robustness objectives. <b>Control</b> <b>commands</b> are defined as sequences of contractions and elongations of active struts to modify the self-stress state of the structure. A two step multi-objective optimization method involving Pareto filtering with hierarchical selection is implemented to determine <b>control</b> <b>commands.</b> Experimental testing on a full scale active tensegrity structure demonstrates validity of the method. In most cases, <b>control</b> <b>commands</b> are more robust when identified by multi-objective optimization method as compared with a single objective and this robustness leads to better control over successive loading events. Evaluation of multiple objectives provides a more global understanding of tensegrity structure behavior than any single objective. Finally, results reveal opportunities for self-adaptive structures that evolve in unknown environments...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Tensegrity {{structures}} {{are composed of}} cables and struts that become stable through self stress. They are good candidates for implementation of active structural control because their flexibility may mean that they cannot meet serviceability criteria. Changes to the self stress influence {{the form of the}} structure. A reliable closed-form solution for obtaining <b>control</b> <b>commands</b> for telescopic compression elements in order to obtain a required shape does not exist for such a closely coupled and geometrically nonlinear structure. Simulating the structural behavior after all possible <b>control</b> <b>commands</b> and testing against constraints and the objective function requires computational times that grow exponentially with the number of actuators. This paper demonstrates that search time can be reduced through use of stochastic search methods and that incrementally storing successfully applied <b>control</b> <b>commands</b> in a case-based reasoning system increases performance during service lives (learning). Such results demonstrate that enhancing control with advanced computing methods provides opportunities for innovative structures...|$|R
