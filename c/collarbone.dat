5|$|Akins {{became a}} free agent before the 2002 season. The Montreal Alouettes {{expressed}} interest in signing Akins, but he decided to re-sign with the Tiger-Cats in May shortly before a deadline imposed by head coach Ron Lancaster. In a pre-season game, Akins suffered a <b>collarbone</b> injury when a player's face mask was driven into his chest. He returned in mid-July. In his second game of the season, Akins scored three touchdowns. He scored {{in each of the}} two following games as well. Akins' success was interrupted in late August when he re-injured his <b>collarbone</b> with deep bruising. After Akins returned, he caught an 84-yard touchdown while accumulating 150 receiving yards against the Alouettes. The Hamilton Tiger-Cats did not qualify for the playoffs in 2002, but Akins had his most successful season, catching 38 receptions for 732 yards and 7 touchdowns. All three values were career-highs for the wide receiver.|$|E
5|$|At {{about the}} same time, backup {{receiver}} and redshirt freshman Jamere Holland was dismissed from the team, although not for any violation of team rules. He was allowed to stay on scholarship for the year. Holland redshirted the previous season after breaking his <b>collarbone,</b> reinjured it during spring practice and had clashed with coaches during his return to fall camp. He would later transfer to the University of Oregon.|$|E
5000|$|Clavicles (<b>collarbones)</b> can {{be partly}} missing {{leaving only the}} medial part of the bone. In 10% cases, they are {{completely}} missing. If the <b>collarbones</b> are completely missing or reduced to small vestiges, this allows hypermobility of the shoulders including ability to touch the shoulders together {{in front of the}} chest. The defect is bilateral 80% of the time. Partial <b>collarbones</b> may cause nerve damage symptoms and therefore have to be removed by surgery.|$|R

He won Liège–Bastogne–Liège and was in form when he broke his <b>collarbone</b> in a pile-up on stage 1 of the Tour. He lost a lot of time. He made it up by winning a stage and {{finishing}} fourth, while his teammates Carlos Sastre and Jakob Piil also won stages.|$|E

5|$|He was {{in great}} {{form for the}} Belgian spring classics, but a fall and {{material}} malfunction kept him from playing {{a part in the}} final of both the E3 Harelbeke and Gent–Wevelgem. Cancellara was one of the favourites to win the renewed Tour of Flanders but played no part in the final due to a crash in the feed zone. It was caused by a discarded water bottle. He suffered a four-part fracture of the right <b>collarbone</b> which ruined his spring campaign.|$|E

He {{took part in}} the offensive sweeps over German-occupied Europe from 1941 to 1944, almost without rest. Johnson was involved in heavy aerial fighting during this period. His combat tour included participation in the Dieppe Raid, Combined Bomber Offensive, Battle of Normandy, Operation Market Garden,the Battle of the Bulge and the Western Allied invasion of Germany.

5|$|In 1967 John left Llanelli RFC for Cardiff RFC {{and here}} he formed a {{partnership}} with Gareth Edwards that {{became one of the}} most famous half-back pairings in world rugby. From 1967, John and Edwards made an inseparable partnership with rugby selectors, being chosen to play together at all levels of the sport, for Cardiff, Wales, the Barbarians and in 1968 for the British Lions tour of South Africa.

5|$|John was {{selected}} for the British Lions in their tour of South Africa in 1968, but played in just four games before an injury forced him to return home. He played in three matches against district teams, Western Province, South Western Districts and , all wins for the tourists. He was then selected for the First Test, played at Johannesburg, against the South Africa national team. John's first Test for the British Lions lasted for only fifteen minutes, when after running for the line he was tackled by Jan Ellis, and John broke his <b>collarbone</b> on landing on the hard ground.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{grew up and}} {{was educated}} in the East Midlands, where he {{qualified}} as an engineer. A sportsman, Johnson broke his <b>collarbone</b> while playing rugby, an injury that later complicated his ambitions of becoming a fighter pilot. Johnson had been interested in aviation since his youth and applied to join the RAF. He was initially rejected, first on social, and then on medical grounds; he was eventually accepted in August 1939. The injury problems, however, returned during his early training and flying career, resulting in him missing the Battle of France and the Battle of Britain between May and October 1940.|$|E
5|$|Many riders {{were named}} as contenders, {{including}} Ivan Basso, Levi Leipheimer, Armstrong, Damiano Cunego, Carlos Sastre, Gilberto Simoni, Danilo Di Luca, Marzio Bruseghin, and Denis Menchov. Before his <b>collarbone</b> injury, Armstrong {{was considered an}} overall favorite, {{and it was also}} noted that three time trials, including the insertion of an unusually long time trial mid-race, might favor him. Pre-race analysis noted that Armstrong, when on his best form, would be a rider very likely to gain from having such a long race against the clock included in the Giro.|$|E

50|$|The chapel with Alena's relics {{became a}} popular place of pilgrimage. Her shrine became {{incorporated}} into the parish church of Forest as a chapel which held her cenotaph and relics. By around 1600, her jawbone and upper arm were preserved in the parish church, each in its own jewel-studded reliquary dating from the 15th century. The rest of the bones, {{with the exception of}} the <b>collarbones,</b> were preserved in the abbey church in a Baroque reliquary (1644) commissioned by Françoise de Bette, abbess 1637-1666. When the abbey was suppressed in 1796 the last abbess, Juana Francisca de Rueda de Conteras (1785-1818), removed this reliquary to a monastery near Würzburg. It was returned to Forest only in 1812.

Gladbach ultimately lost the match 3–1. It was an injury-disrupted season for Domínguez, though, as early in October he suffered a broken <b>collarbone</b> and dislocated shoulder.
