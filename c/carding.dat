5|$|However, the {{technological}} revolution took much longer in Wales {{than it had}} in England, with slow adoption of machinery. Until {{the latter part of}} the 18th century <b>carding</b> and spinning was done at home, and weaving in the village ty-gwydd (loom house), although fulling was done by machine in fulling mills.|$|E
5|$|Wool {{processing}} includes {{removing the}} fleece by shearing, classing the wool by quality, untangling, <b>carding</b> and spinning it into yarn, {{which may be}} knitted or woven into cloth, then finishing the cloth by fulling, napping and pressing.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{topography}} {{of the area}} in the vicinity of Scotch Run, the area near the stream was not settled until some time after the first settlement in the surrounding areas. Alexander McCauley settled on the stream in Beaver Township 1774. Some time before 1820, a <b>carding</b> mill was built by George Fleming on the stream southeast of Mainville. In 1820, it started {{to be used as a}} school, which was run by Jacob Gensel.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{at the end}} of the 14th century, {{no doubt}} on account of the devastation caused mid-century by the Black Death, there was a general shift towards less {{expensive}} techniques. Many things which would have earlier been completely forbidden by the guilds were now commonplace (using low quality wool, <b>carding,</b> etc.). In the silk industry, the use of water-powered mills grew, and by the 15th century, the loom designed by Jean le Calabrais saw nearly universal use.|$|E
5|$|Peel {{had gained}} a {{reputation}} for trying new methods within the industry, {{being one of the}} first textile manufacturers to use <b>carding</b> cylinders. He began experimenting at his home with different forms of printing until, according to family tradition, his young daughter Anne brought him a sprig of parsley and begged him {{to use it as a}} pattern. He etched this design onto a pewter plate to allow the printing, which was then finished with an iron by one of the women of the household. There are other versions of the tale, which dispute whether the experiments happened at the farm at Peel Fold or his house in Fish Lane and suggest a poor neighbour, Mrs. Milton, calendered the cloth to finish it.|$|E
50|$|An insert <b>card</b> is a <b>card</b> that is {{randomly}} {{inserted into}} packs of a sports <b>card</b> offering. These insert <b>cards</b> {{are not part}} of the regular numbering system of a set of sports <b>cards</b> and they tend to have a unique design. Another term for insert <b>cards</b> is chase <b>cards.</b> Insert <b>cards</b> either have their own numbering system (although some insert <b>cards</b> may have no number). Insert <b>cards</b> are found less frequently than base <b>cards.</b> Autographed <b>cards,</b> memorabilia <b>cards</b> and parallel <b>cards</b> are also classified as insert <b>cards.</b> Insert <b>cards</b> are randomly inserted into packs at a specific ratio. A 1:24 ratio specifies that on average one of every 24 packs will contain a <b>card</b> from that insert set.|$|R

5|$|Peel {{worked with}} one of his weavers, James Hargreaves, to {{investigate}} new technologies. In 1762, Peel and Hargreaves set up a <b>carding</b> machine, but decided against using it. When Hargreaves went on to invent the spinning jenny in 1764, Peel was keen to use the technology. He set them up in his factory at Stanhill where Hargreaves worked. In the spring of 1768, the spinning jennies at Peel's factory were blamed for job losses. The factories and Hargreaves' nearby house were the targets of a riot, destroying the spinning jennies withinâ€“ along with some of Peel's own inventions. In reaction, Peel moved his manufacturing away from Lancashire. He decided on Burton-upon-Trent where he built three mills, including cutting a canal for one.|$|E
5|$|As silk was {{a luxury}} good, {{the market was}} small and easily {{saturated}} by machine produced goods. The next innovation in machine produced textiles came in the cotton industry which had a much wider market and produced more affordable goods. Spinning cotton was a more complex process than silk production. The water frame for spinning cotton was developed by Richard Arkwright and patented in 1769. The machines could spin yarn continuously and replaced skilled workers with unskilled supervisors {{to make sure the}} machines didn't break. Water frames varied in size from 4 to 96spindles. For these reasons, the water frame became popular and widespread. In 1771, Richard Arkwright took a lease on land in Cromford. By 1774, his first mill was operational, and in 1776 he began construction of a second mill at Cromford. During this time, he developed machines for pre-spinning and in 1775 took out his second patent. With spinning mechanised, the other processes involved in producing cotton could not keep up and also required mechanisation. He produced a machine for <b>carding,</b> the process which laid out the cotton fibres parallel, however not all his inventions were successful and cleaning the cotton was performed by hand until the 1790s when an effective machine was invented.|$|E
25|$|The cotton {{comes off}} of the picking machine in laps, and is then taken to <b>carding</b> machines. The carders line up the fibres nicely to make them easier to spin. The <b>carding</b> machine {{consists}} mainly of one big roller with smaller ones surrounding it. All of the rollers are covered in small teeth, and as the cotton progresses further on the teeth get finer (i.e. closer together). The cotton leaves the <b>carding</b> machine {{in the form of}} a sliver; a large rope of fibres.|$|E

5000|$|A payment <b>card</b> number, primary {{account number}} (PAN), {{or simply a}} <b>card</b> number, is the <b>card</b> {{identifier}} found on payment <b>cards,</b> such as credit <b>cards</b> and debit <b>cards,</b> as well as stored-value <b>cards,</b> gift <b>cards</b> and other similar <b>cards.</b> In some situations the <b>card</b> number {{is referred to as}} a bank <b>card</b> number.

50|$|A lace <b>card</b> is a punched <b>card</b> {{with all}} holes punched (also called a whoopee <b>card,</b> {{ventilator}} <b>card,</b> flyswatter <b>card,</b> or IBM doily). They were mainly used as practical jokes to cause unwanted disruption in <b>card</b> readers. <b>Card</b> readers tended to jam when a lace <b>card</b> was inserted, as the resulting <b>card</b> had too little structural strength to avoid buckling inside the mechanism. <b>Card</b> punches could also jam trying to produce <b>cards</b> with all holes punched, owing to power-supply problems. When a lace <b>card</b> was fed through the reader, a <b>card</b> knife or <b>card</b> saw (a flat tool used with punched <b>card</b> readers and <b>card</b> punches) {{was needed to}} clear the jam.|$|R
