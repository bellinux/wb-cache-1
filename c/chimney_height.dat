The ventilation availability isdefined as the relative time of the heating season during whicha specified airflow is exceeded. This specified airflow maye. g. be a Building Code requirement if such exists. The influence of different measures, and combinations ofmeasures, on the ventilation availability has been determinedfor the different rooms. It is found that acceptableventilation availability is possibly to achieve with naturalventilation. However, it requires large supply and overflowopenings and extended ventilation chimneys. These chimneys maybe difficult to accept from an esthetical point of view. Thenatural system is also very sensitive for changes in winddirection.

The experiments were performed using a recently developed fine-bubble technique in which fine hydrogen bubbles are produced electrolytically in salt solution to simulate the buoyancy effect in the chimney caused by temperature differences. During the experiments, one sidewall of the solar chimney was uniformly "heated", corresponding to a uniformly distributed solar radiation incidence. Velocities at the room inlet were measured by a particle tracking method; in turn, the average flow rate through the solar chimney system was determined. Parameters studied in the experiments were the cavity width of the solar chimney, the solar radiation intensity, the ventilation inlet areas, and the solar <b>chimney</b> <b>height.</b> Results showed that for a given building geometry and inlet areas, there is an optimum cavity width at which maximum ventilation flow rate can be achieved.
