5|$|Other {{complications}} include encephalitis (1 in 500 patients), {{which is}} more common in adults and may cause temporary disability; permanent pitted scars, most notably on the face; and complications involving the eyes (2 percent of all cases). Pustules can form on the eyelid, conjunctiva, and cornea, leading to complications such as conjunctivitis, keratitis, <b>corneal</b> <b>ulcer,</b> iritis, iridocyclitis, and optic atrophy. Blindness results in approximately 35 percent to 40 percent of eyes affected with keratitis and <b>corneal</b> <b>ulcer.</b> Hemorrhagic smallpox can cause subconjunctival and retinal hemorrhages. In 2 to 5 percent of young children with smallpox, virions reach the joints and bone, causing osteomyelitis variolosa. Lesions are symmetrical, most common in the elbows, tibia, and fibula, and characteristically cause separation of an epiphysis and marked periosteal reactions. Swollen joints limit movement, and arthritis may lead to limb deformities, ankylosis, malformed bones, flail joints, and stubby fingers.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: A 1 : 1 : 2 {{mixture of}} exudates of Anchomonas difformis, Cyrtrospherma senegalense and Pycanthus angolensis is {{claimed to be}} used for the {{treatment}} of <b>corneal</b> <b>ulcers.</b> The purpose of the study is to evaluate the phytochemical constituents, antibacterial activities and the effectiveness of a mixture of these exudates in the treatment of <b>corneal</b> <b>ulcers</b> as claimed in Traditional medicine practice. Method: Fresh exudates were collected in different containers. They were reduced to dryness and each residue tested for phytochemical constituents. Exudates of P. angolensis was further tested for antimicrobial activities and its effect on chemical – induced <b>corneal</b> <b>ulcers</b> in rabbits. Result: Only reducing sugars were detected in exudates of A. angolensis and C. senegalensis. Bioactive constituents detected in exudates of P. angolensis were the reducing sugars and phenolic compounds- tannins and flavonoids. This also showed antimicrobial activity against the organisms used. It healed the NaOH – induced <b>corneal</b> <b>ulcers</b> in rabbits within ten of days of treatment. Conclusion: Exudates of P. angolensis contained bioactive constituents and exhibited antibacterial activity, and healed the <b>corneal</b> <b>ulcers</b> induced in rabbits. Its use in traditional practice for healing <b>corneal</b> <b>ulcers</b> is rational, {{even in the absence of}} exudates of A. angolensis and C. senegalensis...|$|R

25|$|A {{healing of}} a <b>corneal</b> <b>ulcer</b> {{involves}} two processes: migration of surrounding epithelial cells followed by mitosis (dividing) of the cells, and introduction {{of blood vessels}} from the conjunctiva. Superficial small ulcers heal rapidly by the first process. However, larger or deeper ulcers often require the presence of blood vessels to supply inflammatory cells.

25|$|Melting ulcers are {{a type of}} <b>corneal</b> <b>ulcer</b> {{involving}} progressive loss of stroma in a dissolving fashion.

Treatment includes antibiotics and collagenase inhibitors such as acetylcysteine and homologous blood serum. Surgery may be necessary.|$|E
25|$|Treatment of corneal ulcers {{includes}} topical {{antibiotic therapy}} to prevent infection, and pain medications, including topical atropine to stop spasms of the ciliary muscle.

2500|$|A [...] "daily wear" [...] (DW) contact lens is {{designed}} to be worn for one day and removed prior to sleeping. An [...] "extended wear" [...] (EW) contact lens {{is designed}} for continuous overnight wear, typically for up to 6 consecutive nights. Newer materials, such as silicone hydrogels, allow for even longer wear periods of up to 30 consecutive nights; these longer-wear lenses are often referred to as [...] "continuous wear" [...] (CW). EW and CW contact lenses can be worn overnight because of their high oxygen permeability. While awake, the eyes are mostly open, allowing oxygen from the air to dissolve into the tears and pass through the lens to the cornea. While asleep, oxygen is supplied from the blood vessels {{in the back of the}} eyelid. [...] A lens hindering passage of oxygen to the cornea causes corneal hypoxia which can result in serious complications, such as <b>corneal</b> <b>ulcer</b> that, if left untreated, can permanently decrease vision. EW and CW contact lenses typically allow for a transfer of 5–6 times more oxygen than conventional softs, allowing the cornea to remain healthy, even with closed eyelids.|$|E
40|$|AIMS—To {{evaluate}} whether amniotic membrane transplantation {{can be an}} effective alternative treatment for neurotrophic <b>corneal</b> <b>ulcers.</b>  METHODS—Amniotic membrane transplantation was performed in 16  eyes of 15  patients with neurotrophic <b>corneal</b> <b>ulcers</b> and vision equal to or worse than 20 / 200. The neurotrophic state was developed following keratoplasty (four eyes), herpes zoster ophthalmicus (four eyes), diabetes mellitus (four eyes), radiation (two eyes), removal of acoustic neuroma with neuroparalysis (one eye), and herpes simplex keratitis (one eye).  RESULTS—During a mean follow up period of 18. 8  (SD 13. 0) months, one to three layers of amniotic membrane with or without additional membrane as a patch were used for 17  procedures in 16  eyes for persistent neurotrophic <b>corneal</b> <b>ulcers.</b> All but four (76. 4 %) instances of amniotic membrane transplantation achieved rapid epithelialisation in 16. 6  (9. 0) days. Of the four eyes showing delayed healing, three eyes healed by tarsorrhaphy, and the remaining one eye with corneal perforation required penetrating keratoplasty and tarsorrhaphy. Two eyes gained vision better than 20 / 200. The healed corneal surface was accompanied by reduced inflammation.  CONCLUSION—Amniotic membrane transplantation can be considered an effective alternative for treating severe neurotrophic <b>corneal</b> <b>ulcers.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Considering {{the popular}} use of antibiotic-containing eyedrops in Korea, it is {{important}} to know the emerging antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria before treating infectious eye diseases. This is especially important in high-risk groups because of the high incidence of resistant infections and the subsequent treatment requirements. We report two cases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) <b>corneal</b> <b>ulcers</b> in high-risk groups. The first case involved a patient who had keratitis after using antibiotic- and steroid-containing eyedrops to treat a corneal opacity that developed after repeated penetrating keratoplasty. The second case involved a patient who used antibiotic-containing eyedrops and a topical lubricant on a regular basis for > 1 month to treat exposure keratitis due to lagophthalmos. The second patient's problems, which included a persistent superficial infiltration, developed after brain tumor surgery. Both cases showed MRSA on corneal culture, and the <b>corneal</b> <b>ulcers</b> improved in both patients after the application of vancomycin-containing eyedrops. In conclusion, MRSA infection should be considered in <b>corneal</b> <b>ulcers</b> that have a round shape, mild superficial infiltration, and slow progression, especially in high-risk groups. This report includes descriptions of the characteristic features, antibiotic sensitivities, prevention, and successful treatment with vancomycin-containing eyedrops for MRSA <b>corneal</b> <b>ulcers...</b>|$|R
