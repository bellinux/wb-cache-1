25|$|In 17,000 B.C., the Seven Primes {{travel the}} galaxy to create Energon with star-absorbing {{machines}} named Sun Harvesters. The Primes followed a rule: never destroy planets with life; however, one of them, Megatronus Prime, later known as The Fallen, defies this and establishes a Sun Harvester on Earth. He is {{confronted by the}} other Primes, who imprison him before he <b>can</b> <b>harvest</b> the planet's Sun with the Matrix of Leadership. The Primes then sacrifice themselves to hide the Matrix in an unknown location.|$|E
25|$|A recent area of {{research}} is {{in the field of}} bionic lenses. These are visual displays that include built-in electric circuits and light-emitting diodes and <b>can</b> <b>harvest</b> radio waves for their electric power. Bionic lenses can display information beamed from a mobile device overcoming the small display size problem. The technology involves embedding nano and microscale electronic devices in lenses. These lenses will also need to have an array of microlenses to focus the image so that it appears suspended in front of the wearer’s eyes. The lens could also serve as a head-up display for pilots or gamers.|$|E
500|$|Although players could craft {{items in}} Fallout 3, {{these items were}} limited to a few unique weapons. With New Vegas, {{crafting}} was expanded to allow creation of food, drink, drugs and ammunition along with unique weapons. Crafting can be done at workbenches, reloading benches, and campfires, and requires specific components {{as well as a}} sufficient skill level; for instance, cooking food at campfires requires the player to have a sufficient Survival skill level to do so. [...] Some special items can not be made until their recipes/schematics are found. [...] Players <b>can</b> <b>harvest</b> plants to use in recipes, similar to Bethesda's The Elder Scrolls series. [...] In addition to crafting, players can also modify weapons with special firearm modifications. Such modifications can improve the rate of fire or the size of the magazine, or add a mounted telescopic sight to allow for greater range. Modifications for firearms often require either scavenging for them in the Mojave, or purchasing them from vendors.|$|E

2500|$|Immature cocoa pods have {{a variety}} of colours, but most often are green, red, or purple, and as they mature, their colour tends towards yellow or orange, {{particularly}} in the creases. Unlike most fruiting trees, the cacao pod grows directly from the trunk or large branch of a tree rather than from the end of a branch, similar to jackfruit. This makes harvesting by hand easier as most of the pods will not be up in the higher branches. The pods on a tree do not ripen together; harvesting needs to be done periodically through the year. Harvesting occurs between three and four times weekly during the harvest season. The ripe and near-ripe pods, as judged by their colour, are harvested from the trunk and branches of the cocoa tree with a curved knife on a long pole. [...] Care must be used when cutting the stem of the pod to avoid damaging the junction of the stem with the tree, as this is where future flowers and pods will emerge. One person <b>can</b> <b>harvest</b> an estimated 650 pods per day.|$|E
2500|$|Mechanical {{harvesting}} uses a combine, or sugarcane harvester. The Austoft 7000 series, {{the original}} modern harvester design, {{has now been}} copied by other companies, including Cameco/John Deere. The machine cuts the cane {{at the base of}} the stalk, strips the leaves, chops the cane into consistent lengths and deposits it into a transporter following alongside. The harvester then blows the trash back onto the field. Such machines <b>can</b> <b>harvest</b> [...] each hour; however, harvested cane must be rapidly processed. Once cut, sugarcane begins to lose its sugar content, and damage to the cane during mechanical harvesting accelerates this decline. This decline is offset because a modern chopper harvester can complete the harvest faster and more efficiently than hand cutting and loading. Austoft also developed a series of hydraulic high-lift infield transporters to work alongside their harvesters to allow even more rapid transfer of cane to, for example, the nearest railway siding. This mechanical harvesting doesn't require the field to be set on fire; the remains left in the field by the machine consist of the top of the sugar cane and the dead leaves, which act as mulch for the next round of planting.|$|E

50|$|This {{procedure}} {{allows for}} the harvest of leaves for hemp juice as well as hemp seeds from the same field {{in areas where the}} climate is suitable. This procedure starts a few weeks after sowing, with the harvest of the leafy tops only.

If the plant grows on until seeds are ripe, hemp seeds <b>can</b> be <b>harvested.</b> Thus, harvest for juice and harvest for seeds are both possible.
