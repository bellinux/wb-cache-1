5|$|Four bronze {{tables are}} located outside The Exchange on Corn Street, {{probably}} modelled after mobile tables which {{were taken to}} trade fairs and markets. Before the <b>Corn</b> <b>Exchange</b> {{was built in the}} 18th century, the tables—called nails—were located in the Tolzey Walk. This covered area was along the south wall of All Saints Church, which remains as a narrow lane giving access to commercial premises.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Corn</b> <b>Exchange,</b> {{situated}} at the junction of Bank Street and Elwick Road, opened on 3 December 1861. As the name implies, it was originally used for trade, but during the early 20th century its role expanded to cover dinners, dances and trade shows. The building was extended to improve capacity in the 1930s. It was demolished in 1963.|$|E
5|$|The Hotel Metropole {{was built}} in the 1890s and was {{inspired}} by French architecture of the time. The Leeds <b>Corn</b> <b>Exchange</b> was also designed by Cuthbert Brodrick and was built between 1861 and 1864. The building lay derelict for many years until 1985 when it was converted into a shopping centre.|$|E

5|$|The {{clock and}} {{carillon}} (bell tower) of 23 bells was erected in 1922, {{the same year}} as Lutyens' memorial, on the <b>corn</b> <b>exchange</b> in the town centre. Three of the bells were inscribed with names of casualties from the war, chosen to represent all of Spalding's war dead, while others were inscribed with names of those involved in the commemorations. The <b>corn</b> <b>exchange</b> was demolished in 1972 and replaced with the South Holland Centre, an arts venue, with the clock and carillon re-housed in a tower on the roof. After refurbishment of the South Holland Centre in 1998, a new glass tower was built to house the clock and carillon after the bells were cleaned. On Armistice Day (11 November) 1998, the Western Front Association unveiled a plaque on the South Holland Centre to explain the significance of the clock tower.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its name}} it was {{intended}} for merchants of all types, and a number {{directly involved in the}} Guinea and West Indian slave trade used it for business transactions. Inside the <b>Corn</b> <b>Exchange</b> the plasterwork in the main hall represents the four corners of the world, including Africa and America, the latter wearing a headdress of tobacco leaves. On the outside of the building are carvings of African, American, Asian and European figures and animals, again symbols of Bristol's foreign trade including the Bristol slave trade.|$|E

40|$|The {{growth of}} the United States ethanol {{industry}} has been quite extensive, especially in Nebraska, where production has grown from 523 million gallons per year in 2005, to 1, 115 million gallons per year in 2008 (Nebraska Energy Office, 2009). Rural areas are at an advantage for attracting ethanol plants, as prospective plants want to locate {{as close as possible}} to its chief resource - <b>corn.</b> In <b>exchange</b> for locating near its feedstock, ethanol plants offer higher prices in the competition for corn, which in turn has impacted farm income. Surprisingly, little research has been done with regards to an ethanol plant’s impact on farmland values...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} I examine the {{relation}} between <b>corn</b> and soybeans <b>exchange</b> traded funds and their respective futures contracts.

5|$|Most of {{the current}} {{buildings}} in Leeds {{are the product of}} the Industrial Revolution and post war regeneration in the 20th century, as many new buildings were provided in the city's commuter towns and villages to house the increasing suburban population. Leeds city centre is currently undergoing much redevelopment, with a number of skyscrapers such as Bridgewater Place. Many buildings in Leeds have won awards for their architecture: examples are the renovation projects for the <b>Corn</b> <b>Exchange</b> and the Henry Moore Institute, which have won RIBA awards.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{fulling mill}} {{in the town}} by 1394 for the textile industry. After 1820 this {{expanded}} with the town becoming a centre for lace manufacture led by manufacturers who fled from the Luddite resistance they had faced in the English Midlands. Bowden's Old Lace Factory and the Gifford Fox factory are examples of the sites constructed. The Guildhall was built as a <b>Corn</b> <b>Exchange</b> and Guildhall in 1834 {{and is now the}} Town Hall.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} years of the English colony, the {{settlers}} suffered severely during the winter, a period known as the Starving Time. In December 1608, Powhatan offered to sell them an entire [...] "shipload of <b>corn</b> in <b>exchange</b> for a grindstone, fifty swords, some guns, a cock and a hen, copper and beads, and some men to build him an English-style house." [...] Smith affected to accept this proposal but instead of giving Powhatan weapons planned to surprise him and take the corn by force. Sending four [...] "Dutchmen" [...] (Germans) ahead by land to work on the house, Smith headed for Werowocomoco by sea on December 29 with a small force. Powhatan may also have been showing bad faith; while en route, Smith received a report at Warraskoyack that the chief was plotting an ambush of his party.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{clashes between}} the Red Sticks and United States forces {{occurred}} on July 21, 1813. A group of territorial militia intercepted {{a party of}} Red Sticks returning from Spanish Florida, where they had acquired arms from the Spanish governor at Pensacola.

5|$|In the inter-war period, Sleaford's {{population}} remained static, but the Great Depression in the 1930s caused unemployment to rise. Council-housing developments along Drove Lane proved {{insufficient to}} house low-income families after the Westgate slums were cleared in the 1930s so Jubilee Grove opened in that decade {{to meet the}} demand. In the post-war period, there were new housing developments at St Giles Avenue, the Hoplands, Russell Crescent, Jubilee Grove and Grantham Road. Parts of the town were redeveloped: in 1958, the Bristol Arms Arcade opened, the <b>Corn</b> <b>Exchange</b> was demolished in the 1960s and the Waterside Shopping Precinct opened in 1973, as did Flaxwell House, designed to house a department store, though later becoming the national headquarters for Interflora.|$|E
5|$|In 1892 Holst {{wrote the}} music for an {{operetta}} {{in the style of}} Gilbert and Sullivan, Lansdown Castle, or The Sorcerer of Tewkesbury. The piece was performed at Cheltenham <b>Corn</b> <b>Exchange</b> in February 1893; it was well received and its success encouraged him to persevere with composing. He applied for a scholarship at the Royal College of Music (RCM) in London, but the composition scholarship for that year was won by Samuel Coleridge-Taylor. Holst was accepted as a non-scholarship student, and Adolph borrowed £100 to cover the first year's expenses. Holst left Cheltenham for London in May 1893. Money was tight, and partly from frugality and partly from his own inclination he became a vegetarian and a teetotaller. Two years later he was finally granted a scholarship, which slightly eased his financial difficulties, but he retained his austere personal regime.|$|E
5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of war in September 1939 the BBC put into effect its contingency plans to minimise disruption of broadcasting. The corporation withdrew from responsibility for the Proms, with which Wood went ahead, backed by the Royal Philharmonic Society, with the LSO replacing the BBC SO. The BBC SO was relocated from London to Bristol. More than 40 players were released for active service, including the 30 youngest members; the orchestra {{was reduced to a}} complement of 70, although it was increased to 90 later in the war. During 1940 and 1941 Bristol suffered devastation from German air-raids, and the BBC decided to move the orchestra again. In September 1941 the BBC SO took up residence in Bedford, where it remained, giving live broadcasts and making recordings until it returned permanently to its London base at the BBC's BBC Maida Vale studios in 1945. The BBC resumed its support for the Proms in 1942, with the BBC SO returning temporarily to London during the Proms seasons of 1942–45. For the rest of the year, the orchestra played in the hall of Bedford School, and after the launch of the V-1 raids in 1944 the remaining broadcast concerts of that year's Proms season were performed at the Bedford <b>Corn</b> <b>Exchange.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{complexity and}} volatility present in agricultural commodity markets creates {{a need for}} the exploration of macroeconomic impacts on markets in the United States. This study uses two time series econometric methods to explore the possible impacts on agricultural spot markets. The first essay analyzes the recent commodity price run-up by investigating the dynamic correlations between <b>corn,</b> wheat, oil, <b>exchange</b> rates, and gold. By analyzing changes in the daily price series innovations, the research looks {{to test the hypothesis}} put forth by various authors for the reasons associated with the run-up. The second essay uses a latent variable modeling technique to analyze the implicit impact of macroeconomic factors on the beef sector. By uncovering the validity of the model for forecasting, the latent macroeconomic variables used for the forecasts will provide some understanding of how macroeconomics impacts the sector and lend themselves to increasing the forecasting. ^ Results from the first essay show time-varying correlations between <b>corn,</b> oil, and <b>exchange</b> rates are present in the data {{and for the most part}} closely follows the suppositions put forth in the literature. However, correlations between wheat, oil, and exchange rates do not provide the clear picture present in the corn estimations. Results from the second essay show some capability for macroeconomic factors to improve forecasting performance. While the span and time frame for improved forecasting is short, the ability to improve forecasts in the sector for a month is significant. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{town council}} (a parish council {{with the status}} of a town) has {{responsibility}} for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The town council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic; their role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The town council has a reception and offices in the guildhall.
