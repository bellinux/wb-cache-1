Hydrocarbon Law No. 26844 of May 1997 eliminated the exclusive rights of the state-owned Petróleos del Perú S.A. to control the secondary recovery of crude oil, refining, and imports and subsequent resale of petroleum and byproducts. The Peruvian laws have attempted to ensure more-favorable minerals and crude {{oil and gas exploration}} and production contract terms for investors. Legal procedures to obtain mining rights were made easier by the enactment of <b>complementary</b> <b>legislation</b> Supreme Decree No. 018 of July 9, 1992. The Government relinquished exclusive control over exploration, mining, smelting, and refining of metals and fuel minerals. Individuals and private companies are allowed to hold mining permits in Peru. In the legal framework for investment and taxation, no distinction is made among domestic and foreign investors, corporations, joint ventures, and consortia formed in Peru or abroad. Municipalities and Regional governments in areas where mineral resources (metals and industrial minerals) are exploited will receive 50% of the taxes collected to be invested in education and social programs (health, housing, and others) in conformance with the Canon Minero (Ministry Resolution No. 266-2002-EF/15 of May 1, 2002). The remittance of dividends, depreciation, and royalties abroad has no restrictions. Contracts can be signed by investors, and the Government guarantees the stability of legal commitments and taxes. To increase protection of investors’ interests, Peru signed agreements with the World Bank’s Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency in April 1991, which was authorized by Legislative Decree No. 25312 and with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation in December 2002, which was authorized by Legislative Decree No. 25809.|$|E

In relation to players different private organizations are considered: independent organizations and self-interested organizations, which will be further differentiated according {{to the nature of the}} represented interests. In relation to the institutional environment a distinction is assumed between market and private non market rule-making. In the market environment private organizations provide rules, including standard contract forms for a price or more generally for remuneration, in the non market environment private organizations provide contract rules for free.

It can be noticed that schools assume new discourses and translate them into projects and propositions echoing "instituted" discourses, without understanding their determining context and thus blocking practices that could rescue their social role.

40|$|An {{annually}} updated {{guide to}} privacy legislation from Privacy Victoria. Privacy {{is a personal}} right that attaches itself to various concepts including privacy of the home, bodily privacy, information privacy and communications privacy. In Australia, aspects of privacy are protected by laws of trespass, nuisance, breach of confidence and copyright. The courts are also beginning to recognise an emerging tort of invasion of privacy and the Australian Law Reform Commission, in its 2008 report ALRC 108 – For Your Information, Australian Privacy Law and Practice, recommended {{the implementation of a}} statutory cause of action for serious invasions of privacy. Laws limiting the use of surveillance devices or the interception and recording of telephone conversations also have the effect of protecting privacy, as do confidentiality provisions that are often found in laws regulating sensitive matters such as adoption, infectious disease or the handling of criminal records. Most Australian jurisdictions, except Western Australia and South Australia have enacted specific information privacy legislation which regulates how certain public and private sector organisations collect, store and handle personal information and provide a mechanism for individuals to make a complaint to an independent Commissioner about a breach of the relevant legislation. In some jurisdictions, privacy legislation now provides rights for individuals to access and correct their personal information while in other jurisdictions these rights remain in <b>complementary</b> <b>legislation</b> (freedom of information laws). Health information is often given specific legislative protection (health privacy laws) and in Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory, human rights legislation recognise a broader right to privacy and oblige public sector organisations to act {{in a way that is}} compatible with this and other protected rights. Most privacy laws in Australia and overseas are based on internationally accepted standards set down by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 1980 and more recently by the European Union in 1995., have enacted specific information privacy legislation which regulates how certain public and private sector organisations collect, store and handle personal information and provide a mechanism for individuals to make a complaint to an independent Commissioner about a breach of the relevant legislation.

40|$|Historically the {{literature}} (Dick, 1998; Ingram and Hong, 2007; Smolka and Amborski, 2007;Rebelo, 2009, 2012) has asserted {{the idea of}} land social function, {{which means that the}} increasein land value that results from public decisions should be reassigned to the social welfare. But theterritorial management instruments that render this concept operational (surplus value captureinstruments) are still underdeveloped around the world (Hagman and Misczynski, 1978;McCluskey and Franzsen, 2005; Smolka and Amborski, 2007; Alexander et al., 2009; Alterman, 2010, 2011;). The current article mainly focuses on the analysis and proposal of a new territorial managementinstrument aimed at capturing land surplus values that result from planning decisions and fromthe implementation of territorial plans. It is specifically based on the taxation of licensed builtsurfaces above the municipal abstract average built surface. It is duly explained, justified from aneconomic and financial perspective, and applied to the Detailed Plan of Avenida Papa JoãoXXIII, in Fátima (in the Municipality of Ourém, Portugal). In this study average municipalbuilding capacities are computed, as well as the concrete building capacities/m 2 that accrue fromurban interventions in the planning area for the different plots, anticipated kinds of uses, andapplicable urban parameters. The homologous surplus values assigned by the Detailed Plan arefurther anticipated, as well as the potential values this new instrument would be able to collect. The research reported in this article is intended to contribute to the economic and financialsustainability of territorial planning and urban development, socially reassigning the surplusvalues engendered by public decisions, and strengthening municipal finance through theclarification of urban development-related fundsŽ origins and applications, and the developmentof understandable, quantifiable and user-friendly decision-support instruments.

From this research one can conclude that this new territorial management instrument issustainable from an economic and financial standpoint.

Itwill further support the consolidation of the objectives of the new Portuguese Land, TerritorialOrdinance and Urbanism Act, namely through the integration of territorial policies, a greatereffectiveness in plan execution, a reinforced economic and financial sustainability of urbandevelopment processes, and the simplification of urban operations, promoting equity and socialand territorial cohesion...|$|E
40|$|The Report commenced, appropriately, by {{addressing}} the federal contract within which Australian agricultural policy is set. The Australian Constitution limits {{what can be}} done by the Commonwealth and State Governments and establishes procedures for settling arguments about where jurisdictions lie. There is a wider constitutional framework than the Constitution itself. It includes, for example, the Australian Agricultural Council which is the major means of co-ordinating powers and resolving conflicts between the Commonwealth and states in the field of agricultural policy. The federal contract also includes the wide range of co-operative approaches to policy, such as statutory marketing intitutions and the <b>complementary</b> <b>legislation</b> which supports them. The issue of federalism runs through the whole of the Report, but only in Chapter 2 was it addressed as a central issue. The Group viewed the Constitution itself as virtually immutable. The Australian Agricultural Council was criticised for acting only slowly and by consensus. Where there is a fundamental conflict of interest, the Commonwealth's financial strength may need to be used to encourage state co-operation. The emergence of the National Farmers' Federation was seen as hopeful, and there was a hint that a formal link between the Council and the Federation could facilitate consensus. But, on the whole, the tone of the Report regarding the federal contract was not enthusiastic. It was seen to constrain opportunities for change rather than to create them. Issues for the 1980 s with respect to inter-governmental relations were expected to be {{similar to those of the}} past. In Chapter 2, the Group provided a brief synopsis of the respective roles of the Commonwealth and State Governments in areas covered in the rest of the Report, namely, assistance, marketing, international trade, transport, innovation and resource management. But having set the scene with an overview of the constitutional framework, the Group did not return to a federal overview of policy options. It is with that important task in view that I will address briefly three of the issues raised in Chapter 2, namely, assistance, marketing and international trade, and comment on Commonwealth grants to the states which are relevant to the remaining issues.

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} {{that more than half of}} Australia’s {{greenhouse}} gas emissions are generated by the stationary energy sector, express environmental considerations have not featured in the recent sweeping reforms of the Australian Energy Market’s legislative and regulatory framework. On the contrary, current energy market laws, rules and regulations are devoid of any express environmental or sustainability provisions. This is in stark contrast to energy market developments in the European Union and the United Kingdom, where environmental considerations – greenhouse gas emissions and climate change – are fast becoming an integral part of energy market regulation. In 2008 for instance, the UK Parliament successfully enacted several pieces of <b>complementary</b> <b>legislation</b> directed towards supporting the UK’s long term energy and climate change strategy, including the Energy Act, the Planning Act and the Climate Change Act. Remarkably, the UK Government has committed to achieving an 80 per cent reduction on emissions, by 2050. Another interesting feature of the UK Climate Change Act 2008 is the introduction of carbon budgets, which set a legally binding cap on the total volume of permissible greenhouse gas emissions from the UK, measured over five year periods up to 2050. As noted by the UK Government, the ‘Climate Change Act creates a new approach to managing and responding to climate change in the UK, by setting ambitious, legally binding targets, taking powers to help meet those targets, strengthening the institutional framework, enhancing the UK’s ability to adapt to the impact of climate change, and establishing clear and regular accountability to the UK Parliament and to the devolved legislatures’. In light of the environmental deficiencies in the current NEM legislative and regulatory framework, questions arise as to the ways in which the Australian energy market legislative and regulatory framework could be reformed to take adequate account of environmental externalities such as climate change. How, for instance, should current energy market practices be modified to enable sustainability based decision making? What kinds of energy market framework amendments will be necessary to assist with moving the NEM market towards a lower carbon intensive future? Answering these kinds of questions involves, in part, giving consideration to existing measures and responses – direct and indirect – to the climate change challenges faced by energy markets and their participants. In particular, greater attention needs to be given to the possible role of key energy market regulators, namely the AEMC and the AER, in assisting Australian energy markets transition towards a low carbon future. In view of that, the extent to which sustainable regulation and decision making features in the NEM legislative and regulatory framework is the primary focus of the discussion in this chapter. In addition to considering possible amendments to the NEM legislative framework, especially the powers and functions of the two central key market regulators, the AEMC and AER, the role of Courts and Tribunals and the emergence of a body of climate change law is also considered. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The new Murray-Darling {{management}} structure {{is set to}} fail, writes JACK WATERFORD EVERYONE “knows” why the Murray-Darling river management {{has been such a}} mess. The basin runs through four states and a territory, each with its own local interests, not least in irrigation and agriculture. Upstream interests have paid too little attention to downstream interests and needs. Water has been over-allocated, and the environment has not had priority. The Commonwealth’s capacity to take a lead role has been undermined by state and party politics, greed, entrenched rights and drought. But that’s all past, we understand now. Last week the Council of Australian Governments accepted a new model of basin management, with agreed principles and ideas, and, after the payment of a hefty bribe to Victoria, apparent goodwill and common purpose all round. If only it would rain, there might be orderly and sustainable circulation through the nation’s most important veins and arteries. Don’t bet on it. The new model of riverine governance could hardly illustrate better one of the central problems of government in the 21 st century, problems that also bedevil education and health care, and which will also certainly hinder effective action against climate change and the development of an emissions trading system. The problem is not primarily a constitutional one, but it {{is a reflection of the}} fact that the Constitution, which divided power between the Commonwealth and the states, did not set models of how to exercise power jointly. When they do, who governs, and how? To whom are the bodies created responsible? How is money raised, authorised, spent and reviewed? Whose show is it, and how and where does the public, the public interest or the political or judicial process get a look in? The agreement between the Commonwealth and the basin jurisdictions - Queensland, NSW, Victoria, South Australia and the ACT - sets out principles of river management agreed in March, within the context of the national water initiative, which Victoria has just joined. There is to be a basin plan, responsibility for the implementation of which will, in theory, lie with the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, an “independent and expert” reconstitution of the old basin commission. It’s “assisted” in every ambiguous sense of the word by a ministerial council and advisory committee, as well as by a committee of federal and state officials. The authority will be established by a limited referral of powers to the Commonwealth from the states, (probably) some <b>complementary</b> <b>legislation</b> and a base agreement (with semi-constitutional status) of working principles which can be changed only by the unanimous agreement of the parties. The authority must prepare a plan, with which the Commonwealth minister (currently Penny Wong) must agree. If she doesn’t she can send it back with “suggestions. ” If she is still unhappy, she can give the authority directions in writing, which must be explained to parliament. The authority’s role is to “prepare, implement, monitor and enforce” the basin plan, as well as to “implement” decisions made by the Ministerial Council and the Basin Officials Committee. There’s little doubt where the real power lies. The agreement says the officials committee will be “responsible for high-level decision-making in relation to the operation of the River Murray system. ” A Commonwealth-state ministerial council has a generally advisory role, but an executive role in relation to water allocations to each state and territory, as well as over local environmental initiatives and “under certain circumstances, critical human needs and natural resource management programs. ” This, on top of an explicit reaffirmation in the agreement of “the autonomy of the basin states to manage water and other natural resources within their catchments” provides ample scope, down the track, for blackmail, coercion and sweetheart deals designed to elicit cooperation. Got that so far? A quick refresher. Who’s in charge and who will we hang if it doesn’t work out? Who’s actually deciding things? Just in case there is any confusion, the agreement says “decisions of the Basin Officials Committee will be exercised consistent with the delegations received from the Ministerial Council. These delegations will relate to objectives and outcomes consistent with those set by the Ministerial Council, and consistent with the authority having the autonomy to decide on the matters set down in the corporate plan covering program design, delivery, monitoring and reporting arrangements required to implement the decisions of the Ministerial Council and the Basin Officials Committee. ” Clear now? The Commonwealth will appoint the chair and the chief executive of the basin authority, though it must “consult” with the states and ACT about these appointments. The states and ACT can put up two part-time members of the authority (the Commonwealth can veto these) and the Commonwealth two (the states can veto these). Decisions of the Ministerial Council require the unanimous support of ministers. On top of the general arrangements, each state and territory that is party to the agreement will make a separate bilateral agreement with the Commonwealth about programs in its jurisdiction. One could go on through details of the agreement to find potential stumbling points. They might be summarised as showing that, where everyone is in absolute agreement about what to do, the arrangements should work swimmingly. If anyone kicks up a fuss on anything, paralysis is virtually inevitable, at least until the Commonwealth bribes a player back into unanimity. It does not take a cynic to imagine a host of problems ahead. The potential does not turn on changes of government (states are quite used to putting state before party, just as they have long put state before nation). The potential increases massively when any question of compulsorily acquiring water allocations arises; even more when allocations are transferred from sector (say, agriculture) to sector (say, environmental flow or city water) or from region to region (say, from Victoria to SA). At least, once there is actually water to fight about. The susceptibility of the various bodies to rendering accountability to various parliaments, external audit requirements, administrative review or judicial review is far from clear. Most of the dispute-resolution mechanisms, such as they are, involve fights between the parties, not between the bodies and outside parties such as farmer or environmental groups. My opinion, for what it is worth (say $ 20, 000), is that it will be beyond the power of the Commonwealth to constitute the authority without its actions being subject to judicial review under Section 75 of the Constitution, but the value of this may be destroyed by the mixed accountability to ministerial councils and officials’ committees. It has been in fields such as this, as with special purpose grants and mixed responsibilities for health, or aged care, or education, or public housing, that parliamentarians and auditors-general walk away in bemusement. They are unsure of where their authority starts and where it ends. When they get too inquisitive they will be told it is the responsibility of the other side and outside their jurisdiction. The consequence is an accountability and governance black hole. And, almost certainly, very poor management. This is not what the parties have intended but the sort of lowest-common-denominator response we always get with such hybrid arrangements. Structures matter. If, at a time of zeal and sense of common purpose in tackling great national problems, the Commonwealth cannot get good organisations to do the work, it is unlikely to get good work. However valiant, expert and independent the new body, it is being set up to fail. • Jack Waterford is editor-at-large of the Canberra Times, where this article first appeared.
