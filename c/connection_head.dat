50|$|The {{opening of}} the M74 Motorway {{extension}} between Cambuslang and Tradeston in Glasgow in 2011 introduced a quick route {{to and from the}} Newton area. Motorway <b>connections</b> <b>heading</b> south towards Hamilton and England, or towards northern (M73/M80) or eastern Scotland (M8) have been in place for some years. For visitors unfamiliar with the local road network, Junction 2A (Cambuslang/Tollcross) is the most suitable exit as it serves both north and southbound lanes. On suburban roads, generally drivers should follow signs for Cambuslang and then Halfway or Westburn - Newton itself is poorly signposted due to its small population until recently.|$|R

Until 1917, when Finland became an {{independent}} state, the road had been operated by the Finnish State Railways for all its length, including that section. Due to construction of the southern sections of the railroad, {{the western part of}} the Karelian Isthmus on both sides of the Russian-Finnish border became a popular dacha resort place among wealthy St. Petersburgers in the late nineteenth century.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{that work}} was the {{evaluation}} of the quality of welded connections elements (welds) from the 30 HGS steel and titanium alloy Ti 6 Al 4 V. The metallographic, factographic tests were used, and measurements of microhardness with the Vickers method. In the head weld of the 30 HGS steel there were non-metallic partial division and bubbles observed. The average microhardness in the <b>head</b> <b>connection</b> was 320 HV 0. 1. There was no significant increase/decrease observed of microhardness in the head influence zone of the weld. There was a good condition of <b>head</b> <b>connections</b> observed, in accordance with the standard EN 12517 and EN 25817. In the head weld of Ti 6 Al 4 V titanium alloy there were single, occasional non-metallic interjections and bubbles observed. There were no cracks both on the weld, and on the border of the heat influence zone. The value of microhardness in <b>head</b> <b>connection</b> was in the range 300 ÷ 445 HV 0. 1.

50|$|In {{parliament}} Gascoigne was {{a committed}} Foxite whig and {{loyal to the}} Wentworth-Woodhouse <b>connection</b> <b>headed</b> first by Rockingham, and after 1782 by the second Earl Fitzwilliam. At the general election of 1784 Fitzwilliam nominated Gascoigne to be the election manager for the York County election supporting the Foxites Francis Ferrand Foljambe and William Weddell fight against the Pittite candidates William Wilberforce and Henry Duncombe. Despite his best efforts the county election fell into chaos and Gascoigne's committee declined the poll the night preceding the election. Since December 1782 Gascoigne {{had been a member}} of Christopher Wyvill's Yorkshire Association, which agitated for parliamentary reform. Despite eagerly supporting the cause of reform Sir Thomas was forced to resign from the Association during the election when Wyvill came out strongly in support of William Pitt against Fox, nationally, and Fitzwilliam's Wentworth-Woodhouse connection locally in Yorkshire. During the election Gascoigne was offered the parliamentary seat at Malton, which he held until August 1784.|$|R

5000|$|Each AIS {{transceiver}} {{consists of}} one VHF transmitter, two VHF TDMA receivers, one VHF Digital Selective Calling (DSC) receiver, {{and links to}} shipboard display and sensor systems via standard marine electronic communications (such as NMEA 0183, also known as IEC 61162). Timing {{is vital to the}} proper synchronization and slot mapping (transmission scheduling) for a Class A unit. Therefore, every unit is required to have an internal time base, synchronized to a global navigation satellite system (e.g. GPS) receiver. [...] This internal receiver may also be used for position information. However, position is typically provided by an external receiver such as GPS, LORAN-C or an inertial navigation system and the internal receiver is only used as a backup for position information. Other information broadcast by the AIS, if available, is electronically obtained from shipboard equipment through standard marine data <b>connections.</b> <b>Heading</b> information, position (latitude and longitude), [...] "speed over ground", and rate of turn are normally provided by all ships equipped with AIS. Other information, such as destination, and ETA may also be provided.|$|R

50|$|N-cadherin {{adhesion}} further stabilizes the synapse by enabling AMPAR-activation-induced spine head expansion. This morphological change {{helps to}} prevent further synaptic modifications that could jeopardize the information held by the already existing synaptic <b>connections.</b> Spine <b>head</b> expansion accomplishes this by reducing the NMDAR to AMPAR ratio, creating a proportionally smaller calcium influx, {{as well as by}} allowing for faster calcium diffusion out of the spine. The rapid removal of calcium prevents it from initiating the post-translational modifications that would further alter synaptic strength. Overexpression of an N-cadherin mutant incapable of adhesion prevents spine head expansion, demonstrating N-cadherin’s essential role in this process.|$|R

The large proportion of South Korea's population living in apartment blocks helps the spread of DSL, as does a high penetration of consumer electronics in general. Many apartment buildings in built-up metropolitan areas, such as Seoul and Incheon, have speeds of up to 100 Mbit/s. VDSL is commonly found in newer apartments while ADSL is normally found in landed properties where the telephone exchange is far away.|$|R
