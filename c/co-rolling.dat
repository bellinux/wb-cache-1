40|$|One {{of recent}} {{experimental}} progresses in strengthening and toughening metals simultaneously is to adopt techniques of surface mechanical attrition treatment (SMAT) and warm <b>co-rolling</b> to {{304 stainless steel}} (SS). To capture deformation behavior and associated damage initiation/evolution process in the co-rolled SMATed 304 SS, cohesive finite element method (CFEM) is employed in this paper and simulation results are in agreement with experimental results. Both strengthening effect due to high yield stress of the nanograin layer and toughening effect due to non-localized damage in the nanograin layer are captured. Effect of energy release rate of nanograin layer on failure strain of layered co-rolled SMATed 304 SS is investigated. It is found that the more brittle the nanograin layer is, the more potential necking sites in the nanograin layer are, and the more ductile the layered co-rolled SMATed 304 SS is. © 2010 American Institute of Physics...|$|E

The influences of rolling temperature and strain on the microstructure are investigated. The microstructure of LN steel is characterized by methods of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The experimental results reveal that the microstructure of LN steels presents a periodic distribution of nanocrystalline layer, ultra-fine grained layer and coarse grained layer with graded transition of grain size. The integrated effects of SMAT and WCR on the refinement of grain size, involving in dislocation subdivision, twinning and dynamic recrystallization, are discussed. The tensile properties of LN steels exhibit both high strength and good ductility resulting from good work hardening behavior.

40|$|A down-selection {{process has}} been applied to the U-Mo fuel alloy based {{monolithic}} plate fuel design, supported by irradiation testing of small fuel plates containing various design parameters. The irradiation testing provided data on fuel performance issues such as swelling, fuel-cladding interaction (interdiffusion), blister formation at elevated temperatures, and fuel/cladding bond quality and effectiveness. U- 10 Mo (wt%) was selected as the fuel alloy of choice, accepting a somewhat lower uranium density for the benefits of phase stability. U- 7 Mo could be used, with a barrier, where the trade-off for uranium density is critical to nuclear performance. A zirconium foil barrier between fuel and cladding was chosen to provide a predictable, well-bonded, fuel-cladding interface, allowing little or no fuel-cladding interaction. The fuel plate testing conducted to inform this selection was based on the use of U- 10 Mo foils fabricated by hot <b>co-rolling</b> with a Zr foil.

The main drawback of the manufac-ture of monolithic nuclear fuel was analyzed using two surface coating methods: aluminum sput-tering and transient liquid phase bonding (TLPB). Coating was done with a commercial alloy of Al-Si (R- 4047). These techniques were used to improve the metallurgical bonding between the UMo and the cladding by rolling. Finally, design parameters and manufacture of UMo plate fuels were established. Mechanical tests were used to characterize the plates, resulting in UTS values of about 700 and 1000 MPa for the UMo alloys. These results are complemented with metrological analyses, X-Ray diffraction (XRD), thermal analyses, and metallography. X-rays and ultrasound scanners were used to monitor bonding and the <b>co-rolling</b> effects.

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the present}} study is first to {{describe}} an original process, the so called duplex process, whose feature is the coupling between the well-known SMAT (Surface Mechanical Attrition Treatment) and the traditional <b>co-rolling.</b> The first step of this process consists of SMA-Treatment of 316 L stainless steel sheets to generate nanocrystalline layers on their top surfaces according to the grain refinement mechanism of austenitic steels which is well described in the literature. During the second step, three treated sheets are co-rolled at 550 °C to obtain a semi-massive nanocrystallised multilayer structure with improved mechanical strength alternating nanocrystalline, transition and coarse grain layers. The second part of this work deals with the mechanical and the microstructural characterization of the as-obtained structures. Thus, sharp nanoindentation tests performed over the cross section of the laminates coupled with Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) confirm the presence of nanograins after the thermomechanical treatment. In addition, the enhanced yield strength demonstrated by tensile tests correlate well with the theoretical volume fractions of nano- and transition layers. The interface cohesion between the sheets is tested by three-point bending tests and the interface bonding is evaluated by microstructural observations...|$|E
40|$|Ferritic {{stainless}} steel enriched with aluminium (> 7 %) represents the best {{material for the}} production of substrates in catalytic converters because of its good corrosion resistance at high temperature (700 - 1000 °C).

40|$|Within the Reduced Enrichment for Research and Test Reactors (RERTR) program {{directed}} by the US Department of Energy (DOE), UMo fuel-foils are being developed {{in an effort to}} realize high density monolithic fuel plates for use in high-flux research and test reactors. Namely, targeted are reactors that are not amenable to Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) fuel conversion via utilization of high density dispersion-based fuels, i. e. 8 - 9 gU/cc. LEU conversion of reactors having a need for > 8 - 9 gU/cc fuel density will only be possible by way of monolithic fuel forms. The UMo fuel foils under development afford fuel meat density of ~ 16 gU/cc and thus have the potential to facilitate LEU conversions without any significant reactor-performance penalty. Two primary challenges have been established with respect to UMo monolithic fuel development; namely, fuel element fabrication and in-reactor fuel element performance. Both issues are being addressed concurrently at the Idaho National Laboratory. An overview is provided of the ongoing monolithic UMo fuel development effort at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL); including development of complex/graded fuel foils.

40|$|Stainless steel, {{because of}} their high {{chromium}} content, naturally presents a native oxide layer that protects them against aggressive environment. In a first approach, this passive film when in contact with aqueous environment {{can be seen as}} composed of two layers (bi-layer) : An internal one, which is in direct contact with the metallic substrate, formed of ferrous and chromium oxides types [(Fe, Cr) 2 O 3] and an external one essentially composed of hydroxide as Cr 2 (OH 3) nH 2 O. In a certain way, from studies, it generally admitted that stability of the passive state is mainly conditioned by the film composition and that it can be locally limited, by the presence of chloride ions or when breaking of the passive film is observed. In such a case, chloride ions are adsorbed on the passive layer, and their penetration leads to pitting. It's thus generally observed that pitting corrosion starts at non metallic inclusions (MnS). Surface mechanical attrition treatment, among other SPD processes, is at present known to be efficient to form a nanocrystalline layer on stainless steel through successive grain refinement mechanisms. More recently, {{it has been shown that}} combined with a <b>co-rolling</b> process, thick structures alternating nanostructured layers, with coarse grained layers, can be developed and lead to rather interesting mechanical properties. However, never electrochemical corrosion properties of such a nanocristallised structures have been study. In particular, because the volume fraction of grains boundaries, their structure and their compositions change after reduction of the grain size up to nanometer scale, the nature and the distribution of non metallic inclusions and of chromium is affected leading to drastic change of the corrosion resistance. In addition, it's proven that SMAT induce phase transformation and some roughness that have also effects on corrosion resistance. In this work, some clarifications of the electrochemical aspects of austenitic stainless steel after SMAT and <b>co-rolling</b> are given in relation with the observed microsctrure. In particular, after TEM and DRX characterizations of the microstructural changed observed in SMA treated samples, potentiondynamic polarization experiments with reverse scan were performed as well as measurement by means of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy. The re-passivation capability of the SMA treated austenitic stainless steel and an approximate thickness of the oxide layer were calculated. It is shown that austenite phase transformation observed at the extreme surface has the tendency to degrade the corrosion resistance in presence of chloride ions whereas removing of these regions lead to higher corrosion resistance than austenitic stainless steel alone. The multiple diffusion channels produce through grains refinement seems to be the reason for this aspect. From literature, it's not well understood and often contradictory why nanostructuration can increase the corrosion properties of materials (case of Ni, Zn and stainless steel) whereas it can degrade them for others. It's thus rather interesting to lead such a study in case of surface mechanical attrition treatment...|$|E
40|$|The {{lifetime}} of thin-walled catalyst-carrying foils Is {{directly linked to}} the overall amount of aluminum present in the base alloy. Ferritic stainless steel containing more than 7 wt. % of Al represents an interesting material {{for the production of}} substrates in catalytic converters because of its good corrosion resistance at high temperature. Despite that, the considerable brittleness of the alloy makes production by means of traditional metallurgical processes difficult. Enriching the steel surface with aluminum avoids these problems and due to the high superficial aluminum concentration, enhances the Al 2 O 3 scale formation {{in the early stages of}} the oxidation process. Among several techniques, the <b>co-rolling</b> process appears to be a promising technology for enriching ferritic stainless steel surfaces with aluminum without affecting the structural and mechanical properties of the substrate. This process involves cold rolling the annealed AISI 430 ferritic stainless steel together with aluminum foil to form an Al-steel-Al sandwich. After a preoxidation treatment the resultant assemblies were subjected to cyclic oxidation in air. Their oxidation behavior was then characterized by the weight gain versus the number of cycle curves. Oxides were examined by SEM and the phases were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results highlight that in the lower range of temperatures (T< 900 °C) the oxide layer appears to be very adherent, even after 1000 cycles. While at temperatures higher than 900 °C, the scale is characterized by convolutions and spalls off after a few hundred cycles. Copyright © 2007 by ASTM International...|$|E
