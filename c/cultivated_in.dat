5|$|Sugar {{also led}} to some {{industrialization}} of areas where sugar cane was grown. For example, Lieutenant J. Paterson, of the Bengal establishment, persuaded the British Government that sugar cane could be <b>cultivated</b> <b>in</b> British India with many advantages and at less expense than in the West Indies; as a result, sugar factories were established in Bihar in eastern India. During the Napoleonic Wars, sugar beet production increased in continental Europe {{because of the difficulty}} of importing sugar when shipping was subject to blockade. By 1880, the sugar beet was the main source of sugar in Europe. It was <b>cultivated</b> <b>in</b> Lincolnshire and other parts of England, although the United Kingdom continued to import the main part of its sugar from its colonies.|$|E
5|$|Tripura is an agrarian {{state with}} {{more than half of the}} {{population}} dependent on agriculture and allied activities. However, due to hilly terrain and forest cover, only 27 per cent of the land is available for cultivation. Rice, the major crop of the state, is <b>cultivated</b> <b>in</b> 91 per cent of the cropped area. According to the Directorate of Economics & Statistics, Government of Tripura, in 2009–10, potato, sugarcane, mesta, pulses and jute were the other major crops <b>cultivated</b> <b>in</b> the state. Jackfruit and pineapple top the list of horticultural products. Traditionally, most of the indigenous population practised jhum method (a type of slash-and-burn) of cultivation. The number of people dependent on jhum has declined over the years.|$|E

5|$|Collected by French {{botanist}} Jacques Labillardière in 1792–93, Telopea truncata {{was first}} scientifically described in 1805. Genetic {{analysis revealed that}} the Tasmanian waratah is the most distinctive of the five waratah species. It can be <b>cultivated</b> <b>in</b> temperate climates, requiring soils with good drainage and ample moisture in part-shaded or sunny positions. Several commercially available cultivars that are hybrids of T.truncata with the New South Wales waratah (T.speciosissima) and Gippsland waratah (T.oreades) have been developed.|$|E

5|$|A {{long-lived}} plant {{reaching an}} age of up to 60 years, I.anemonifolius resprouts from its woody base, known as a lignotuber, after bushfire. Seedlings appear in the year following a fire. Although I.anemonifolius was collected by Daniel Solander in 1770, it was not described until 1796 by Richard Salisbury. Several varieties have been named, though none are now recognised as distinct. It was first <b>cultivated</b> <b>in</b> the United Kingdom in 1791. I.anemonifolius grows readily in the garden if located in a sunny or part-shaded spot with sandy soil and good drainage.|$|E
5|$|As more {{virgin forest}} {{was lost to}} tavy, {{communities}} increasingly planted and cultivated permanent plots of land. By 600CE, groups of these early settlers had moved inland and begun clearing the forests of the central highlands. Rice was originally dry planted or <b>cultivated</b> <b>in</b> marshy lowland areas, which produced low yields. Irrigated rice paddies were adopted in the highlands around 1600, first in Betsileo country in the southern highlands, then later in the northern highlands of Imerina. By the time terraced paddies emerged in central Madagascar over the next century, the area's original forest cover had largely vanished. In its place were scattered villages ringed with nearby rice paddies and crop fields a day's walk away, surrounded by vast plains of sterile grasses.|$|E

The Mary Akin Memorial Herb Garden, located behind Grayson's Tavern, features a variety of herbs that were commonly <b>cultivated</b> <b>in</b> the area during the late 18th and early 19th century, including chives, fennel, honeysuckle, lavender, rosemary, sage, and thyme.

5|$|By the 1830s {{the species}} was in {{cultivation}} in continental Europe. It was recorded as being <b>cultivated</b> <b>in</b> {{the garden of}} Karl von Hügel in Vienna, Austria in 1831, and in 1833 it was listed amongst the rare plants that had been introduced into Belgium. Along with several hundred other native Australian plants it was exhibited at plant shows held at Utrecht and Haarlem in the Netherlands in the 1840s and 1850s. By this time, however, English gardeners {{had already begun to}} lose interest in the Proteaceae, {{and by the end of}} the 19th century European interest in the cultivation of Proteaceae was virtually non-existent.|$|E
5|$|Common herbs such as sage, mustard, {{and parsley}} were grown {{and used in}} cooking all over Europe, as were caraway, mint, dill and fennel. Many of these plants grew {{throughout}} all of Europe or were <b>cultivated</b> <b>in</b> gardens, and were a cheaper alternative to exotic spices. Mustard was particularly popular with meat products and was described by Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179) as poor man's food. While locally grown herbs were less prestigious than spices, they were still used in upper-class food, but were then usually less prominent or included merely as coloring. Anise was used to flavor fish and chicken dishes, and its seeds were served as sugar-coated comfits.|$|E
5|$|I'itoi {{onion is}} a {{prolific}} multiplier onion <b>cultivated</b> <b>in</b> the Baboquivari Peak Wilderness, Arizona area. This small-bulb type has a shallot-like flavour and {{is easy to}} grow and ideal for hot, dry climates. Bulbs are separated, and planted in the fall 1in below the surface and 12in apart. Bulbs will multiply into clumps and can be harvested throughout the cooler months. Tops die back {{in the heat of}} summer and may return with heavy rains; bulbs can remain in the ground or be harvested and stored in a cool dry place for planting in the fall. The plants rarely flower; propagation is by division.|$|E

In this article, the authors use the statistic data between the year 1997 and the year 2006 to analyze and discuss changes <b>in</b> <b>cultivated</b> land area <b>in</b> the past decade in Yubei District and further discuss the driving factors that affect changes <b>in</b> utilization of <b>cultivated</b> land by using the principal component analysis method on that basis {{and set up a}} multiple regression model. The research result shows that, the total tendency of the quantity of <b>cultivated</b> land <b>in</b> Yubei District exhibits a declining trend year by year and changes <b>in</b> <b>cultivated</b> land protection policy, permanent asset investment and agricultural population conversion level are the major macro driving factors that affect changes in the quantity of <b>cultivated</b> land <b>in</b> Yubei District. Therefore, it will be critical in determining changes <b>in</b> quantity of <b>cultivated</b> land <b>in</b> Yubei District in the future to persistently carry out and implement the national cultivated land protection policy, enlarge investment in land consolidation and coordinate contradictions between economic development and cultivated land protection...|$|R

Hardy and fast growing, C.australis is widely planted in New Zealand gardens, parks and streets, and numerous cultivars are available.

Most species that are native to Western Australia will be cold hardy to at least -1 to -2°C. The few that can be found all over Australia, like S. graminifolium, will tolerate a wider range of habitat since their native ranges includes a great diversity of ecoregions. Some species of triggerplants are suitable for cultivation outdoors outside of the Australian continent including most of the United Kingdom and as far north as New York City or Seattle in the United States.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the easier}} Western species to grow, Banksia lemanniana has some horticultural {{potential}} in its attractive chocolate buds, green-yellow hanging flower spikes and large grey spikes with prominent follicles.

It favours a sunny position and good drainage, and has been successfully <b>cultivated</b> <b>in</b> more humid climates on Australia's east coast. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 27 to 43 days to germinate.|$|E
