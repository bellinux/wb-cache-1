40|$|We put upper {{limits of}} {{secondary}} burst {{of star formation}} in elliptical galaxies of the Gonzalez's (1993) sample, most of which locates in small groups, based on the <b>colour</b> <b>dispersion</b> around the U-V versus central velocity dispersion relation, and the equivalent width of Hbeta absorption. There are significant number of Hbeta strong galaxies which have EW(Hbeta) > 2 A, however they do not always have bluer colours in U-V. To be consistent with small <b>colour</b> <b>dispersion</b> of U-V, the mass fraction of secondary burst to the total mass should be less than only 10 % at the maximum within recent 2 Gyr. This result suggests that even if recent galaxy merging produce some ellipticals, {{it should not have}} been accompanied by an intensive star burst, and hence it could not involve large gas-rich systems. A capture of dwarf galaxy is more likely to explain dynamical disturbances observed in some elliptical galaxies. The above analysis based on the U-V is not compatible with the one based on the line indices, which requires that more than 10 % of mass is present in a 2 Gyr old star burst to cover the full range of the observed Hbeta (de Jong & Davies 1997). The discrepancy might be partly explained by the internal extinction localized at the region where young stars form. However, considering that the Hbeta index might have great uncertainties both in models and in observational data, we basically rely on U-V analysis.

40|$|The {{theoretical}} results {{produced by}} the Hone and Howe Phenomenological Model for the low shear viscosity of polystyrene latex-gelatin dispersions were compared to experimental data. Polystyrene latex particles were used as a model to analyse the rheological behaviour of the photographic (<b>colour</b> coupler) <b>dispersions.</b> The polystyrene latex particles analysed were 70 nm in diameter and were suspended in 10 % (by weight) gelatin solution. An adsorbed gelatin layer of 28 nm was determined from previous work and was assumed for this study. As the temperature was increased, {{the accuracy of the}} rheological model also increased. A sensitivity analysis was performed (by varying the scaling factor) on the Hone and Howe Model across changing temperatures and latex volume fractions. A linear relationship was observed between the scaling factor and temperature for a constant latex volume fraction. However, a correlation between the scaling factor and the two latex volume fractions (8 and 5 %) was not apparent. Further experimentation could be used to identify such a correlation. Rheological results for four latex particle diameters were also analysed (70, 380, 660 and 1094 nm). It was shown that at larger particles sizes (> 100 nm) the scaling factor was independent of temperature. Furthermore, for larger latex particles, the hard sphere and Hone and Howe models produce results relatively close to one another. This was expected as such particle sizes can be treated as hard spheres with little compressibility of the gelatin layer. Lastly, the rheology of two <b>colour</b> coupler <b>dispersions</b> (supplied by Kodak Australasia Pty. Ltd.) was also analysed. Clear linear relationships were observed between temperature and scaling factor for these substances. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|We analyse the {{spatially}} resolved colours {{of distant}} galaxies of known redshift in the Hubble Deep Field, {{using a new}} technique based on matching resolved four-band internal colour data to the predictions of evolutionary synthesis models. We quantify the relative age, dispersion in age, ongoing star-formation rate, star-formation history, and dust content of these galaxies. To demonstrate {{the potential of the}} method, we study the near-complete sample of 32 I ~ 0. 5 studied by Bouwens et al (1997). The dispersion of the internal colours of a sample of 0. 4 <z< 1 early-type field galaxies in the HDF indicates that ~ 40 % [4 / 11] show evidence of star formation which must have occurred within the past third of their ages at the epoch of observation. For a sample of well-defined spirals, we similarly exploit the <b>dispersion</b> in <b>colour</b> to analyse the relative histories of bulge and disc stars, in order to resolve the current controversy regarding the ages of galactic bulges. Dust and metallicity gradients are ruled out as major contributors to the <b>colour</b> <b>dispersions</b> we observe in these systems. The median ages of bulge stars are found to be signicantly older than those in galactic discs, and exhibit markedly different star-formation histories. This result is inconsistent with a secular growth of bulges from disc instabilities, but consistent with gradual disc formation by accretion of gas onto bulges, as predicted by hierarchical theories. We extend our technique in order to discuss the star formation history of the entire Bouwens et al sample in the context of earlier studies concerned with global star formation histories.

40|$|We apply a {{generalized}} {{model for the}} determination {{and analysis of the}} dielectric function of optically anisotropic materials with <b>colour</b> <b>dispersion</b> to phonon modes and show that it can also be generalized to excitonic polarizabilities and electronic band-band transitions. We take into account that the tensor components of the dielectric function within the cartesian coordinate system are not independent from each other but are rather projections of the polarization of dipoles oscillating along directions defined by the, non-cartesian, crystal symmetry and polarizability. The dielectric function is then composed of a series of oscillators pointing in different directions. The application of this model is exemplarily demonstrated for monoclinic (β-phase) Ga_ 2 O_ 3 bulk single crystals. Using this model, we are able to relate electronic transitions observed in the dielectric function to atomic bond directions and orbitals in the real space crystal structure. For thin films revealing rotational domains we show that the optical biaxiality is reduced to uniaxial optical response. Comment: 10 pages, 6 figure...|$|E

At the time of 4 hours and the ratio of 1 / 10 almost pigment particles are coated by the polymer. The formed polymer covers of pigments have the average thickness of 5. 95 nm.

40|$|A {{study of}} the time {{sequence}} of optical colours of a large sample of nearby Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is presented. We study the dependence of the colour time evolution {{with respect to the}} lightcurve shape, parametrized by the stretch factor. We fit the spectral template that minimizes the <b>colour</b> <b>dispersion</b> in SNe Ia, as measured through UBVRI photometry of near-by supernovae. A clear colour dependence upon lightcurve shape is found, with the narrower lightcurves being redder up to about one month past lightcurve maximum. We also derive an average reddening law, after correcting for lightcurve shape differences in intrinsic colour, that is well described by a Cardelli, Clayton & Mathis law with R_V= 1. 75 ± 0. 27 for 80 Type Ia supernovae with E(B-V) < 0. 7 mag. A subset sample including 69 SNe with modest reddening, E(B-V) < 0. 25 mag, yields a significantly smaller value, R_V 1, suggesting that the observed reddening of Type Ia supernovae may have a more complex origin, perhaps involving other processes beside extinction by interstellar dust in the host galaxy.

We find average Stroemgren metallicities of - 1. 71 dex for M 55 and - 1. 62 dex for M 22. The determination of metal abundances in cluster giants with the Stroemgren m 1 index in comparison with spectroscopic data from Briley et al. (1993) and Norris & Freeman (1982, 1983) shows that M 55 and M 22 have different distributions of cyanogen strengths. In M 55, no CN abundance variations are visible among the giant-branch stars. In striking contrast, a large dispersion of cyanogen strengths is seen in M 22. For M 22 we find patchily distributed variations in the foreground reddening of E(B-V) = 0. 07, which explain the <b>colour</b> <b>dispersion</b> among the giant-branch stars. There is no evidence for a spread in iron within M 22 since the variations in m 1 are dominated by the large range in CN abundances, as already found by Anthony-Twarog et al. (1995).

40|$|We {{present a}} study of pixel Colour Magnitude Diagrams (pCMDs) for a sample of 69 nearby galaxies chosen to span {{a wide range of}} Hubble types. Our goal is to {{determine}} how useful a pixel approach is for studying galaxies according to their stellar light distributions and content. The galaxy images were analysed on a pixel-by-pixel basis to reveal the structure of the individual pCMDs. We find that the average surface brightness (or projected mass density) in each pixel varies according to galaxy type. Early-type galaxies exihibit a clear ``prime sequence'' and some pCMDs of face-on spirals reveal ``inverse-L'' structures. We find that the <b>colour</b> <b>dispersion</b> at a given magnitude is found to be approximately constant in early-type galaxies but this quantity varies in the mid and late-types. We investigate individual galaxies and find that the pCMDs can be used to pick out morphological features. We discuss the discovery of ``Red Hooks'' in the pCMDs of six early-type galaxies and two spirals and postulate their origins. We develop quantitative methods to characterise the pCMDs, including measures of the blue-to-red light ratio and colour distributions of each galaxy and we organise these by morphological type. We compare the colours of the pixels in each galaxy with the stellar population models of Bruzual & Charlot (2003) to calculate star formation histories for each galaxy type and compare these to the stellar mass within each pixel. Maps of pixel stellar mass and mass-to-light ratio are compared to galaxy images. We apply the pCMD technique to three galaxies in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field to test the usefulness of the analysis at high redshift. We propose that these results can be used as part of a new system of automated classification of galaxies that can be applied at high redshift. Comment: 16 pages, 20 figures, MNRAS, accepted.

40|$|Three kornerupine occurrences are {{reported}} in distinctive SiO 2 -poor, MgO- and Al 2 O 3 -rich paragneisses from the Namaqualand Metamorphic Complex in South Africa. Kornerupine coexists stably with phlogopite, cordierite, orthopyroxene, gedrite, sapphirine, sillimanite and plagioclase and, in sapphirine-free rocks, with spinel and corundum. Tourmaline of a texturally older generation than kornerupine is commonly present in the same samples. Ten analysed kornerupines show a variation in total Fe as FeO from 1. 8 to 10. 9 weight per cent. B 2 O 3 contents are estimated from x-ray data and a few spectrochemical analyses to range from 0. 9 to 3. 5 weight per cent. There is a strong inverse correlation between B 3 + and Al 3 +. Total iron content has a strong and systematic effect on refractive index, <b>colour</b> and <b>dispersion.</b> Fe and Mg are systematically partitioned with the other minerals, and Mg/(Mg+Fe) ratios increase as follows: spinel <gedrite≈orthopyroxene< sapphirine ≈kornerupine≈tourmaline≈phlogopite<cordierite. Kornerupine commonly forms rims on sapphirine or sapphirine-cordierite aggregates, idioblastic prisms in phlogopite, or coarse intergrowths with gedrite or orthopyroxene. Kornerupine probably grew at, or shortly after, a metamorphic climax under granulite-facies conditions of 750 °- 800 ° C and 4 to 6. 5 kbar. Late formation and good crystal shape suggest a model for kornerupine development in which fluids provided a medium for the redistribution of mobile species (including boron) and caused the stabilization of kornerupine rather than tourmaline as the boron-bearing silicate in these rocks. A possible source of fluids at an appropriate stage in the metamorphic development is from crystallizing migmatite leucosomes in adjacent metapelitic and biotite gneisses. The unusual bulk compositions of these gneisses are interpreted to result from the isochemical metamorphism of a Mg-Al-rich, locally boron-bearing, sedimentary precursor. © 1985 Springer-Verlag...|$|R

Two of these confirmed Perseus UCDs have extremely blue colours (B-R < 0. 6 mag), reside in star forming filaments surrounding NGC 1275, and have likely formed as massive star clusters in the last 100 Myr. We also measure a central velocity dispersion of a third, UCD 13 (σ_ 0 = 38 ± 8 km s^- 1), the most extended UCD in our sample.

We confirm 22 early-type galaxies as Antlia members, using GEMINI-GMOS and MAGELLAN-MIKE spectra. Among them, 2 belong to the rare type of compact ellipticals (cE), and 5 are new faint dwarfs {{that had never been}} catalogued before. In addition, we present 16 newly identified low surface brightness galaxy candidates, almost half of them displaying morphologies consistent with being Antlia's counterparts of Local Group dSphs, that extend the faint luminosity limit of our study down to MB = - 10. 1 (BT = 22. 6) mag. We built an improved CMR in the Washington photometric system, i. e. integrated T 1 magnitudes versus (C - T 1) colours, which extends ∼ 4 mag faintwards the limit of spectroscopically confirmed Antlia members. When only confirmed early-type members are considered, this relation extends over 10 mag in luminosity with no apparent change in slope or increase in <b>colour</b> <b>dispersion</b> towards its faint end. The intrinsic colour scatter of the relation is compared with those reported for other clusters of galaxies; we argue that {{it is likely that the}} large scatter of the CMR, usually reported at faint magnitudes, is mostly due to photometric errors along with an improper membership/morphological classification. The distinct behaviour of the luminosity versus mean effective surface brightness relation at the bright and faint ends is analyzed, while it is confirmed that dE galaxies on the same relation present a very similar effective radius, regardless of their colour. The projected spatial distribution of the member sample confirms the existence of two groups in Antlia, each one dominated by a giant elliptical galaxy and with one cE located close to each giant.

40|$|Plant-pollinator {{interactions}} have a {{very important}} role in the reproductive cycle of flowering plants. Plants typically provide small amounts of nutrition for animal pollinators, and pollinators incidentally transfer pollen between flowers to enable sexual reproduction. Despite the apparent simplicity, this type of interaction is very complex. Colour is a major cue used for signalling by flowers. I investigated floral spectral signals, as perceived as colour by a pollinator’s visual perception, the phylogenetic pattern of colour signal evolution, and the signal-receiver relationship in two natural communities in Victoria, Australia, and over an altitudinal gradient in Nepal. From this study, I found that bird-visited flowers and insect-visited flowers differ significantly from each other in their respective chromatic cues. These differences are concentrated near wavelengths of optimal colour discrimination for the respective pollinators. Further investigation considering a steep altitudinal gradient of Nepal Himalaya provides evidence that species in subtropical vegetation had colours significantly less dispersed in a bee-vision colour space than expected by chance, while subalpine species had significantly greater <b>colour</b> <b>dispersion</b> than expected by chance. I found that at both low altitude sub-tropical and high altitude sub-alpine regions of Nepal, flowers had spectral signals that closely matched the regions of best colour discrimination by hymenopteran trichromatic pollinators. This finding is somewhat surprising because hymenopteran pollinators, especially bees, tend to decline in abundance with increasing altitude, while flies become relatively more abundant and are thought to be important pollinators at high elevation. Next I investigated the similarity of floral colours in orchids and non-orchids species as perceived by insect pollinators. Surprisingly, there was no congruency between phylogeny and position in a colour space, showing that floral colours were highly labile traits in the evolution for both orchids and non-orchids. Finally, I addressed the question about role of flower colour in two natural communities in Australia and found that fruit sets of focal plant species increased in the presence of neighbouring flowering plants. Thus the presence of co-flowering plants appears to facilitate the pollination of other species in the communities studie...|$|E

We show the statistical distributions of the a_ 3 /a and a_ 4 /a parameters as a function of velocity <b>dispersion,</b> magnitude, and <b>colour.</b> The a_ 4 /a parameter is correlated with the ellipticity and absolute Petrosian magnitude of galaxies. No significant correlation was found between the a_ 4 /a parameter with <b>colour</b> and velocity <b>dispersion.</b> A cross-correlation between the FIRST survey and the SDSS data reveals a lack of powerful radio emitters in discy E/S 0 s, as previously found by Bender et al.

The average change in the position angle is much larger, about 4. 12 degree, due to an extended tail.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of carbon black with an acrylic resin {{in aqueous solution}} has been investigated by rheology. Two carbon blacks Raven L and Raven M, with similar particle size and surface characteristics but quite different particle morphologies, have been examined. In the absence of polymer, stable aqueous dispersions could not be obtained. Stable dispersions could be obtained however upon addition of polymer to a level corresponding to a ratio of 50 mg of polymer per 13 m 2 of surface area (i. e. l 5 wt% particles). These stable dispersions exhibit flow typical of concentrated dispersions - Newtonian behaviour up to some apparent 'yield' or critical value. Above which shear thinning is observed. This critical stress increases with increasing polymer concentration. At low polymer concentrations, the dispersions are predominantly viscous at low shear stresses. The phase angle decreases significantly over a narrow shear stress range and the rheology tends to more elastic behaviour. At higher shear stresses, the dependence on particle morphology is weak. Furthermore, increasing the pH of the aqueous dispersions has little effect, but changing the adsorbent does alter the rheology somewhat. In addition to Raven L and Raven M, other carbon blacks were also investigated in which the surface chemistry had been modified by ozonolysis. In addition to aqueous systems, a selection of oil based systems have also been investigated. Here, four carbon blacks were used with a bitumen binder: the low-medium structured fine particle (Raven L), the medium-high structured fine particle (Raven M), a low-medium structured coarse particle (N 772) and a medium-high structured coarse particle (N 660).

40|$|The {{employment}} of polypropylene in clothing industry is restricted {{due to its}} low dye absorption. An increase in wettability of polypropylene fibers and a simultaneous increase {{of the interaction between}} dyes and fibres should be suitable procedure in order to increase the dye absorption. The author investigates the possibilities of plasma-assisted hydrophilization in order to improve the colouring properties. There is an increased water wettability of the surface of polypropylene in comparison to the untreated material with an increase in time of treatment in oxygen plasma, with an increase of the microwave input and with decreasing distance between probe material and microwave input. The degree of hydrophilization of polypropylene fibres treated by barriere discharge increases with increasing exposition time nearly being independent of the microwave performance. The oxygen supply does not influence the wettability during the plasma-assisted hydrophilization. The wettability of the surface of propylene foils decreases with increasing storage at atmosphere due to a reorientation of the plasma induced functional groups towards the interior of the foils. The wettability of plasma-assisted propylene foils in water nearly is unchanged. The functional groups are on the surface. With increasing duration of treatment in oxygen plasma and in barriere discharges, there is an increase of oxygen containing functional groups in the surface of polypropylene foils. XPS experiments at oxygen plasma treated polypropylene foils increases and then decreases with increasing duration of storage. This decrease is due to a reorientation of the oxygen containing groups from the surface into the bulk medium. With increasing duration of treatment, the surface roughness of the probe increases leading to a reduction of the contact angle with water and to an increase of the oxygen content in the surface. Beside the plasma induced insertion of oxygen containing groups, the author observes plasma induced etching processes resulting in degradation substances. The author also investigates the mount behavior of the <b>dispersion</b> <b>colour</b> Resolin Red FB and the mount behavior of the solution colours Sudan Blue II and Sudan Red B on polypropylene fibres treated by oxygen plasma and barriere discharge, respectively. The mount performance of all three colours on plasma treated fibres is greater in comparison to untreated materials. Polypropylene fibres treated by barriere discharge do not show this behavior due to the low degree of hydrophilization of the fibre surface. Sudan Blue II has the highest mount rate according to untreated and plasmatreated polypropylene fibres.
