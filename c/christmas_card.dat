25|$|On March 3, 2007, an American Greetings <b>Christmas</b> <b>card</b> {{sent to the}} Chronicle, postmarked 1990 in Eureka had {{recently}} been discovered in their photo files by editorial assistant Daniel King. Inside the envelope, with the card, was a photocopy of two U.S. Postal keys on a magnet keychain. The handwriting on the envelope resembles Zodiac's print, but was declared inauthentic by forensic document examiner Lloyd Cunningham. However, not all Zodiac experts agree with Cunningham's analysis. There is no return address on the envelope nor is his crossed-circle signature to be found. The card itself is unmarked. The Chronicle turned over all the material to the Vallejo Police Department for further analysis.|$|E

25|$|Several {{changes were}} made to the National Christmas Tree and the Pageant of Peace in 1993 and 1994. Although {{organizers}} considered moving the pageant to the Washington Monument or onto the National Mall, no change in location was actually made.

A study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory showed that solar lighting could be used to help illuminate the tree during the daytime, and the lights (donated by the United States Department of Energy) were used. 1994 also saw the first commercial sales of official National Christmas Tree items. The National Park Service approved the sales after organizers said proceeds would be used to fund the Pageant of Peace. Two items were sold: a National Christmas Tree ornament, and a limited edition <b>Christmas</b> <b>card</b> bearing an image of the tree.|$|E
