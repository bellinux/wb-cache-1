25|$|In chemistry, {{there are}} five {{important}} symmetry operations. The identity operation (E) consists of leaving the molecule as it is. This is equivalent to any number of full rotations around any axis. This is a symmetry of all molecules, whereas the symmetry group of a <b>chiral</b> <b>molecule</b> consists of only the identity operation. Rotation around an axis (Cn) consists of rotating the molecule around a specific axis by a specific angle. For example, if a water molecule rotates 180Â° around the axis that passes through the oxygen atom and between the hydrogen atoms, {{it is in the}} same configuration as it started. In this case, , since applying it twice produces the identity operation. Other symmetry operations are: reflection, inversion and improper rotation (rotation followed by reflection).|$|E

On a molecular viewpoint, the linear optical properties of <b>chiral</b> <b>molecules</b> necessitate {{to include the}} magnetic dipole response, but such {{is not the case}} for second-order nonlinear optics where fully electric-dipole response is sufficient. We propose here a full quantum-mechanical calculation of the hyperpolarizability of <b>chiral</b> <b>molecules</b> in the "one-electron" model which shows that (i) such <b>chiral</b> <b>molecules</b> are inherently nonlinear and (i) for nonlinear response, achiral and chiral contributions can have the same order of magnitude, contrarily to what is observed in linear optics...|$|R

25|$|We {{have seen}} (above) that the {{birefringence}} {{of a type}} of crystal is useful in identifying it, and thus detection of linear birefringence is especially useful in geology and mineralogy. Linearly polarized light generally has its polarization state altered upon transmission through such a crystal, making it stand out when viewed in between two crossed polarizers, {{as seen in the}} photograph, above. Likewise, in chemistry, rotation of polarization axes in a liquid solution can be a useful measurement. In a liquid, linear birefringence is impossible, however there may be circular birefringence when a <b>chiral</b> <b>molecule</b> is in solution. When the right and left handed enantiomers of such a molecule are present in equal numbers (a so-called racemic mixture) then their effects cancel out. However, when there is only one (or a preponderance of one), as is more often the case for organic molecules, a net circular birefringence (or optical activity) is observed, revealing the magnitude of that imbalance (or the concentration of the molecule itself, when it can be assumed that only one enantiomer is present). This is measured using a polarimeter in which polarized light is passed through a tube of the liquid, {{at the end of which}} is another polarizer which is rotated in order to null the transmission of light through it.|$|E

The interactions between <b>chiral</b> <b>molecules</b> and nanostructures have been investigated. Our studies focus {{on the case of}} <b>chiral</b> <b>molecules</b> inserted into plasmonic hot spots of nanostructures. Our results show that the total CD of the system with two <b>chiral</b> <b>molecules</b> is not sum for two cases when two <b>chiral</b> <b>molecules</b> inserted respectively into the hot spots of nanoparticle clusters as the distances among nanoparticles are small, although the relationship is established at the case of large interparticle distances. The plasmonic CD arising from structure chirality of nanocomposites depends strongly on the relative positions and orientations of nanospheroids, and are much greater than that from molecule-induced chirality. However, the molecule-induced plasmonic CD effect from the molecule-NP nanocomposites with special chiral structures can be spectrally distinguishable from the structure chirality-based optical activity. Our results provide a new theoretical framework for understanding the two different aspects of plasmonic CD effect in molecule-NP nanocomposites, which would be helpful for the experimental design of novel biosensors to realize ultrasensitive probe of <b>chiral</b> information of <b>molecules</b> by plasmon-based nanotechnology...|$|R
