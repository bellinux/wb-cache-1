5|$|Arias-Maldonado {{argues that}} {{traditional}} {{appeals to the}} value of nonhuman animals have failed to be sufficiently motivating, and that, instead, human/nonhuman relationships are appropriately grounded upon the ideas of human exceptionalism and human domination. These notions, he claims, can be the basis of political transformation for nonhuman animals. He argues that once these ideas are properly understood, they can ground an idea of human sympathy for nonhuman animals, which is just one part of a <b>caring</b> <b>and</b> sustainable Anthropocene. Even if an alternative politics might ultimately be preferable, Arias-Maldonado argues, a change to a focus on sympathy might be useful and realistic as a political strategy.|$|E
5|$|Male orangutans play {{almost no}} role in raising the young. Females {{do most of the}} <b>caring</b> <b>and</b> socializing of the young. A female often has an older {{offspring}} with her to help in socializing the infant. Infant orangutans are completely dependent on their mothers for {{the first two years of}} their lives. The mother will carry the infant during travelling, as well as feed it and sleep with it in the same night nest. For the first four months, the infant is carried on its belly and never relieves physical contact. In the following months, the time an infant spends with its mother decreases.|$|E
30|$|To {{achieve the}} goals of child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> {{education}} presented in Chapter I (General Provisions), day nurseries should devise ‘child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> education process’, a fundamental element for child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> detailed ‘teaching plans’. The ‘child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> education process’ and ‘teaching plans (plans of child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> education)’ should contain flexible, evolutionary, and consistent considerations for children {{so that they can}} live a stable life and conduct meaningful activities while being under the care of day nurseries. In addition, day nurseries should <b>care</b> <b>and</b> educate children based on the ‘plans of child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> education’ and make efforts to evaluate and improve the contents of child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> education.

30|$|As shown above, the ‘child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> {{education}} process’, a basic {{element of}} ‘child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> education plans’, should be necessarily arranged by day nurseries under the New Guidelines and {{be subject to}} evaluation.

5|$|Securely {{attached}} {{children are}} {{best able to}} explore when they have the knowledge of a secure base (their caregiver) to return to in times of need. When assistance is given, this bolsters the sense of security and also, assuming the parent's assistance is helpful, educates the child in {{how to cope with}} the same problem in the future. Therefore, secure attachment {{can be seen as the}} most adaptive attachment style. According to some psychological researchers, a child becomes securely attached when the parent is available and able to meet the needs of the child in a responsive and appropriate manner. At infancy and early childhood, if parents are <b>caring</b> <b>and</b> attentive towards their children, those children will be more prone to secure attachment.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MTech(Public Management)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2006 One of the {{challenges}} facing the South African community is the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The epidemic not only disrupts the economy but one of its emerging impacts is through {{the children who are}} left orphaned. The challenge has come at a time when economic circumstances are making it difficult for extended families to lend a helping hand to children who are orphaned as a result of HIV/AIDS. The children left behind are usually left on their own or are absorbed through <b>care</b> <b>and</b> support centres which are being becoming popular. The challenge of these <b>care</b> <b>and</b> support centres has come at a time when an increase in abuse by the personnel of <b>care</b> <b>and</b> support centres has emerged internationally. Communities can no longer {{turn a blind eye to}} the atrocities that are being experienced by the children within these centres. This challenge is double edged as communities feel isolated by the <b>care</b> <b>and</b> support centres which are based within their communities. The challenge is how communities can breach the gap between children within <b>care</b> <b>and</b> support centres and children who are left on their own. The <b>care</b> <b>and</b> support centres available for HIV/AIDS orphans in Khayelitsha are predominantly run by foreign donors, which limit community participation. This has led to the isolation of community members <b>and</b> <b>care</b> <b>and</b> support centre staff and the core problem of this study will address the evaluation of the <b>care</b> <b>and</b> support centres. Questions such as what happens to children's properties after their parents' death, and do they belong in <b>care</b> <b>and</b> support centres or within their communities arise. These are the areas which will be scrutinized in the study. Areas in which this thesis will attempt to provide insights and make concrete recommendations. Simultaneously with the extensive exploration of <b>care</b> <b>and</b> support centres available for HIV/AIDS orphans theories include the : • Available <b>care</b> <b>and</b> support centres • Community participation within <b>care</b> <b>and</b> support centres • The concept of "ubuntu' in relation to family existence It is hoped that the focus on the <b>care</b> <b>and</b> support centres available for HIV/AIDS orphans will make some contribution to effective <b>care</b> <b>and</b> support centres in this areas, thereby increasing community participation which in turn will revive the concept of ubuntu within communities. Finally, recommendations such as the direct involvement of community members is required to attain which services the <b>care</b> <b>and</b> support centres can offer to the community and how the community play an active role within <b>care</b> <b>and</b> support centres will be offered in this thesis, as informed by the survey results, to effectively manage <b>care</b> <b>and</b> support centres for HIV/AIDS orphans in Khayelitsha...|$|R

25|$|The {{basis of}} this {{approach}} is to look at mental illness or distress {{from the perspective of a}} spiritual crisis. Spiritual interventions focus on developing a sense of meaning, purpose and hope for the person in their current life experience. Spiritual interventions involve listening to the person's story and facilitating the person to connect to God, a greater power or greater whole, perhaps by using meditation or prayer. This may be a religious or non-religious experience depending on the individual's own spirituality. Spiritual interventions, along with psychosocial interventions, emphasize the importance of engagement, however, spiritual interventions focus more on <b>caring</b> <b>and</b> 'being with' the person during their time of crisis, rather than intervening and trying and 'fix' the problem. Spiritual interventions tend to be based on qualitative research and share some similarities with the humanistic approach to psychotherapy.|$|E

30|$|The plans, however, {{have two}} problems, {{explained}} as follows. The first problem concerns the inherent {{characteristics of the}} plans of child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> education. They are not absolute but hypothetic plans. The plans are devised not by a specific individual but {{by a group of}} nursery teachers who are equally involved in the formation, revision, and evaluation of the plans. This process allows child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> education practices to develop more creatively. On the other hand, self-evaluation is personal and subjective, and it is not powerful enough to start massive changes desired in the plans of child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> education. Furthermore, self-evaluation stifles creativity of the practices of child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> education by exaggerating the plans of child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> education as faultless, and prevents the plans from becoming scientifically valid through the practices of child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> education.|$|R
30|$|The {{second issue}} is the ‘plans of child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> {{education}}’ (child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> education process and teaching plans) and self-evaluation. According to the report on the revision of the New Guidelines by the Revision-Related Examination Body (2007), {{it is expected that}} the child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> education process and the process-based teaching plans will motivate teachers to reflect on their child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> education practices, evaluate themselves, and improve their capacity. To build on the child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> education process, teaching plans, and teachers’ self-evaluation, day nurseries should make efforts to listen to the opinions of parents and local community residents, do self-evaluations and make the evaluation results public. This is intended to enable day nurseries to enhance the quality of child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> education system and fulfill their social obligation. In particular, the report by the Revision-Related Examination Body states that all day nurseries are required to promote teachers’ understanding on their own challenges, using self-evaluation results to the best effect. In addition, the level of the entire staff’s teaching quality and specialization must be enhanced through systematic training programs and self-studies. Moreover, the director’s responsibility should be clearly defined so that the quality of child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> education provided by teachers can be improved. All of the above stipulations are about teachers’ self-evaluation on child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> education effectiveness in accordance with the plans of child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> education. The plans aim {{to improve the quality of}} individual teachers as well as that of child <b>care</b> <b>and</b> education.|$|R
