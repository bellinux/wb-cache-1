5000|$|Deborah Coyne took {{a role in}} {{opposing}} the Meech Lake Accord, a comprehensive package of constitutional amendments designed to gain the province of Quebec's formal acceptance of the Constitution Act, 1982. Coyne was among many prominent Liberals who disagreed with the Accord, including Pierre Elliott Trudeau, Donald Johnston and Jean Chrétien, although the issue split the federal Liberal caucus. She was {{a founding member of}} the Canadian Coalition on the Constitution, a grass-roots group that opposed the agreement. From 1989 to 1991, Coyne served as constitutional advisor to Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells. Among the premiers, Wells was the staunchest opponent of the Meech Lake Constitutional Accord. Following the death of the Accord, partly at the hands of the Newfoundland House of Assembly, she opposed the Charlottetown Accord, a subsequent attempt to amend the Canadian constitution. The <b>Charlottetown</b> <b>agreement</b> was submitted to a national referendum in 1992 and was ultimately rejected by a majority of Canadian voters. Coyne led one of the [...] "No" [...] committees in the campaign and spoke widely against the deal.|$|E

From the works of Dimitrios Karmis and Alain-G. Gagnon, the paper presents three types of federalism: universalist, communitarian and utilitarian, which are discussed in relation to the constitutional situation after the repatriation of the Constitution in 1982 and the Trudeau model. These three approaches to federalism are subsequently applied to the case study of immigration policies and their decentralization. Through the example of these policies the article shows that, even if from a constitutional point of view {{there is a lack of}} overlapping consensus on the principles of the federation, certain aspects of the reforms that were part of the failed Meech Lake (1988) and <b>Charlottetown</b> (1992) <b>agreements</b> have been rescued out of the Constitution. This allows for the conclusion that the Canadian federation’s modus vivendi allows for its institutional functioning but is far from satisfying the ideal overlapping consensus, which could only emerge out from a multinational pact...|$|R
