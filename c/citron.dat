5|$|Madsen's {{idea was}} to bring {{attention}} {{to the story of}} Flammen and <b>Citron</b> as he felt it had been neglected or misrepresented. The most expensive Danish film produced to that date, it was co-produced by German companies because initially there was no interest in producing the film in Denmark. Portraying the protagonists as morally ambiguous characters, the director tried to depict war as a complicated experience that goes beyond a good versus evil dichotomy. With visual and narrative references borrowed from film noir and the French film Army of Shadows, Flame & <b>Citron</b> also explores themes of love, betrayal, and the emotional aspects of relationships.|$|E
5|$|Set {{after the}} Nazi {{invasion}} of Denmark, the film {{focuses on the}} Holger Danske resistance group's Bent Faurschou Hviid (known as Flammen) and Jørgen Haagen Schmith (known as <b>Citron).</b> In a bar, Bent flirts with a woman, who identifies herself as Ketty Selmer and disturbs him by saying his real name. Bent and Jørgen follow the woman, and she tells Bent she is an emissary from Stockholm to Copenhagen.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{nominated}} for fourteen Robert Awards, winning Best Costume Design, Best Make-Up, Best Production Design, Best Sound, and Best Special Effects. Out of three Bodil Awards nominations, Flame & <b>Citron</b> won Best Cinematography. At the Zulu Awards, it won all three awards {{for which it was}} nominated. The film was also nominated for the European Film Awards, Marrakech International Film Festival, and Valladolid International Film Festival, but did not win any award.|$|E

5|$|A lemon drop is a {{cocktail}} with a lemony, {{sweet and sour}} flavor, whereby the sweet and sour ingredients serve to contrast and balance one another. It is a vodka-based cocktail that is prepared {{with the addition of}} lemon juice, triple sec and simple syrup. Plain or citrus-flavored vodka may be used in its preparation, such as <b>citron</b> vodka. Lemon-flavored vodka is also sometimes used. Lemon juice that has been freshly squeezed may be used, which can produce a superior drink compared to using commercially prepared lemon juice. Some versions are prepared using the juice from Meyer lemons.|$|E

5|$|In Jainism, Kubera is the {{attendant}} Yaksha of the 19th Tirthankar Mallinath. He is usually called Sarvanubhuti or Sarvahna, {{and may be}} depicted with four faces, rainbow colours and eight arms. The Digambara sect of Jainism gives him six weapons and three heads; while the Svetambaras portray him with four to six arms, numerous choices of weapons, though his attributes, the money bag and <b>citron</b> fruit are consistent. He may ride a man or an elephant. He {{is related to the}} Buddhist Jambhala rather than the Hindu Kubera.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Briarcliff {{resident}} and artist Myril Adler proposed {{a series of}} exhibits of graphic art; the first showing was in October of that year and recurred each month thereafter, each with Sunday opening receptions. Exhibitors included Adler, Michael Ponce de Leon, Seong Moy, Rodolfo Abularach, Fritz Eichenberg, Jacob Landau, George Earl Ortman, Minna <b>Citron,</b> and Alfredo Da Silva. Exhibited works included etchings and engravings, woodcuts, cellocuts, lithographs, collage intaglios, and serigraphs. As {{a result of these}} exhibits, the library began a collection of prints donated by the exhibiting artists. In the library's small space, Adler displayed prints between shelves and in the youth and children's reading rooms.|$|E
5|$|In the film, Aksel Winther, who {{is based}} on Vilhelm Leifer, {{is the one who}} gives Flammen and <b>Citron</b> orders to kill. Birkelund pointed out that he had already moved to Sweden by the time of their assassinations, while Madsen stated he was sure Leifer gave orders before leaving the country. Also, they met Frode Jacobsen in a meeting in Sweden, and he is said to have given orders from there. Birkelund {{rejected}} the idea of Jacobsen giving orders, but Madsen said the meetings were created by him to show that the resistance movements of that time had approaches different from those of their present-day counterparts.|$|E

5|$|Feminism {{became a}} {{principal}} concern of musicologists in the 1980s {{as part of}} the New Musicology. Prior to this, in the 1970s, musicologists were beginning to discover women composers and performers, and had begun to review concepts of canon, genius, genre and periodization from a feminist perspective. In other words, the question of how women musicians fit into traditional music history was now being asked. Through the 1980s and 1990s, this trend continued as musicologists like Susan McClary, Marcia <b>Citron</b> and Ruth Solie began to consider the cultural reasons for the marginalizing of women from the received body of work. Concepts such as music as gendered discourse; professionalism; reception of women's music; examination of the sites of music production; relative wealth and education of women; popular music studies in relation to women's identity; patriarchal ideas in music analysis; and notions of gender and difference are among the themes examined during this time.|$|E
25|$|The <b>citron</b> {{varieties}} traditionally used as Etrog, are the Diamante <b>Citron</b> from Italy, the Greek <b>Citron,</b> the Balady <b>Citron</b> from Israel, the Moroccan and Yemenite Citrons.|$|E
25|$|The {{preferred}} etrog {{was now the}} Balady <b>citron</b> of Israel, {{which had}} just started being imported, and they regarded even the Corsican <b>citron</b> above the Corfu, while the most respected Genoese <b>citron</b> {{was very hard to}} get.|$|E
25|$|Jewish {{communities}} in Europe and America {{then turned to}} Palestine, where etrog farmers had been marketing etrogim to Europe since the late 1850s through The Fruit of the Goodly Tree Association. Some Jewish communities still preferred <b>citrons</b> from Italy, Greece, Morocco, or Yemen, but many Jews seeking <b>citrons</b> turned to Eretz Yisrael, the land of Israel. These days, American Jews continue to import {{the majority of their}} holiday etrogim from Israel, besides during Shmita when there are some halachic problems exporting the produce of Israel.|$|R
50|$|These taxa all interbreed freely, {{despite being}} quite genetically distinct. They {{probably}} arose through allopatric speciation, with <b>citrons</b> evolving in northern Indochina, pummelos in the Malay Archipelago, and mandarines in Vietnam, southern China, and Japan.|$|R

25|$|While <b>citron</b> {{trees are}} still found on Corfu, and in Naxos, the <b>citron</b> {{is no longer}} {{exported}} from Greece for the ritual purpose.

25|$|In 2006, in {{preparation}} for an initial public stock offering (IPO), Michael Snyder, former president of ADT Security Services replaced Vonage co-founder Jeffrey A. <b>Citron</b> as CEO. <b>Citron</b> could not preside over the IPO, because he was permanently barred from associating with any securities brokers or dealers.

The company announced plans for 10% (180) layoffs, as it secured $215 million in financing.|$|E
25|$|Although the graft of Greek <b>citron</b> on Balady {{rootstock}} was a {{great idea}} from practical and Halachic views, it induced suspicion from customers who wondered why the Israeli <b>citron</b> was suddenly so beautiful with an erect pitam.

25|$|Alexander Ziskind Mintz, an Ashkenazi merchant, started {{claiming}} in 1846 {{that only}} those growing in Parga are not grafted, and therefore kosher for the ritual. He claimed {{that under the}} previous Ottoman system, <b>citrons</b> could only be planted in Parga {{under the control of}} Ali Pasha, who collected all proceeds for the Ottoman empire, and those were thus the only <b>citrons</b> known as kosher and un-grafted through the years. Since the rules have been changed, and farmers are allowed to earn their income and pay only a tax, that's how the plantations have expanded to Agia and Preveza. And since those places are new, no one could not be sure whether those picked from newly planted trees, were grafted or not, at least without careful tree checking upon picking.|$|R
50|$|Although Diamante is also {{growing in}} Puerto Rico, Sicily and Sardinia, their <b>citrons</b> {{are not used}} for the Jewish ritual, since no kashrut {{certification}} was present at tranplantation.
