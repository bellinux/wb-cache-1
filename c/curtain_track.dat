50|$|In 1950 it {{was awarded}} {{the first of many}} {{contracts}} for diesel locomotives by the Commonwealth Railways after it was appointed the Australian licensee for Electro-Motive Diesel products. Apart from building locomotives and rolling stock, Clyde Engineering diversified into telephone and industrial electronic equipment, machine tools, domestic aluminium ware, road making and earth making equipment, hydraulic pumps, product finishing equipment, filtration systems, boilers, power stations and firing equipment, car batteries, hoists and cranes, door and <b>curtain</b> <b>tracks</b> and motor vehicle distribution.|$|R
50|$|Extrusion is a {{manufacturing}} process {{used to make}} pipes, hoses, drinking straws, <b>curtain</b> <b>tracks,</b> rods, and fibre. The granules melt into a liquid which is forced through a die, forming a long 'tube like' shape. The shape of the die determines {{the shape of the}} tube. The extrusion is then cooled and forms a solid shape. The tube may be printed upon, and cut at equal intervals. The pieces may be rolled for storage or packed together.Shapes that can result from extrusion include T-sections, U-sections, square sections, I-sections, L-sections and circular sections.|$|R
50|$|The {{finish of}} the {{interior}} walls and ceilings is generally painted plaster but walls were originally finished with wallpaper. With the exception of wet areas, the floors are carpet over timber. The rich dark finish of the internal joinery, including timber veneered doors and timber architraves and skirtings, contrasts with the white walls. A recess in the reveals of the windows accommodates <b>curtain</b> <b>tracks.</b> A similar recess {{is located in the}} opening between the dining and living area and originally was fitted with brown velvet curtains. The original built-in heating system is no longer used but electric radiators remain in the walls of the former surgery and main bedroom. A system of electric bells located in the downstairs hallway, operates doorbells at the house and consulting room entries and connects the main bedroom to the former maids quarters. The house retains some original light fittings in the entry hall and dining room.|$|R
5000|$|Mies {{found the}} large open exhibit {{halls of the}} turn of the century to be very much in {{character}} with his sense of the industrial era. Here he applied the concept of an unobstructed space that is flexible for use by people. The interior appears to be a single open room, its space ebbing and flowing around two wood blocks; one a wardrobe cabinet and the other a kitchen, toilet, and fireplace block (the [...] "core"). The larger fireplace-kitchen core seems like a separate house nesting within the larger glass house. The building is essentially one large room filled with freestanding elements that provide subtle differentiations within an open space, implied but not dictated, zones for sleeping, cooking, dressing, eating, and sitting. Very private areas such as toilets, and mechanical rooms are enclosed within the core. Drawings recently made public by the Museum of Modern Art indicate that the architect provided ceiling details that allow for the addition of <b>curtain</b> <b>tracks</b> that would allow privacy separations of the open spaces into three [...] "rooms". The drapery was never installed.|$|R
2500|$|The M113 {{armoured}} {{personnel carrier}} {{was first introduced}} in 1976, and 5/7 RAR officially adopted the [...] "mechanised" [...] suffix in June 1984 {{and has been a}} significant part of the battalion's heritage ever since. The unit deployed on operational service with the vehicles during INTERFET in East Timor in 1999 and maintained a QRF presence with M113s in Timor-Leste from 2006–09. The most recent M113AS4 Armoured Personnel Carriers were introduced on 15 November 2007. The ceremonial handover took place at Robertson Barracks, where one of the vehicles on display was fitted with extra armour, spall <b>curtains</b> and <b>track</b> shrouds.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} design {{has been changed}} little. In 1965, a <b>curtain</b> and <b>track</b> {{were added to the}} stage. In the 1970s, the Feld Brothers added a three-pole circus tent to cover part of the stage which was changed to a truss and canvas roof system by the Shakespeare Theatre Company in cooperation with NPS in 1991. In the early 1990s, the NPS renovated the public restrooms, repaired the roofs, and did some electrical upgrades in the backstage area. Between the 2003 and 2004 summer performance seasons, all new seats were installed and the drainage in the seating area was improved. Electrical service and wiring was also updated. A major renovation project to the stage area is planned for the future.|$|R
50|$|In 1945, {{the line}} was cut by the Inner German border. West of the border a {{temporary}} terminus was created at Nienbergen as the former station in the Lower Saxon town of Bergen an der Dumme was 1,200 meters east of the Iron <b>Curtain.</b> The second <b>track</b> was removed in two phases in 1946 and the 1980s: first, the section from Wieren to Nienbergen was singled, then the second track was also removed between Wieren and Uelzen.|$|R

50|$|Healthcare cubicle {{curtains}} are factory {{made and}} constructed from different woven fabrics stitched {{together with the}} top portion of open mesh of the curtain {{as required by the}} National Fire Protection Association (NFPA-701 large & small scale). The suggested fire prevention and regulatory codes are followed by local, state and Federal fire marshals with Healthcare patient safety in mind. The suggestion for mesh is seventy-percent (70%) open allowing for ceiling sprinkler head water penetration in event of fire. The vertical length requirement for mesh size is determined by the number of horizontal inches of the <b>curtain</b> ceiling <b>track</b> from the sprinkler head. Example: If ceiling track is six (6") inches from ceiling sprinkler head, the required vertical length of the mesh is approximately six (6") inches. The maximum vertical mesh length required is eighteen inches (18") regardless of additional distance from the ceiling sprinkler head. The code for the vertical mesh requirement is found under National Fire Protection Agency code NFPA-701/large and small scale (NFPA-701). The lower portion of the cubicle curtain is opaque to ensure patient privacy. Cubicle curtain factory made fabric with an antimicrobial finish is not required by code but is becoming more common in medical treatment facilities to reduce the spread of germs within a facility. All cubicle curtains are required to be fire-retardant by NFPA code. The fire-retardant properties can be topically applied and/or inherent {{to a wide range of}} synthetic fibers used for cubicle curtains.|$|R
40|$|With {{a view to}} an {{application}} in heat recovery from hot gases, the fluid dynamics of a curtain of particles falling in a horizontal gas stream was studied. Air with a uniform velocity profile flowed through a duct with cross-section of 0. 15 × 0. 60 m. A stream of sand particles, with a mean diameter of 204 μm and density of 2640 kg/m 3, was fed into the duct from above to form a curtain across the entire width of the duct. The particle flowrates ranged from 0. 031 to 0. 047 kg/s. The inlet particle curtain thickness {{in the direction of}} the gas flow ranged from 0. 02 to 0. 10 m, and the horizontal air velocity was varied from zero to 1. 2 m/s. In an experimental study, the trajectory of the particle <b>curtain</b> was <b>tracked</b> using high-speed video camera and the velocity profile of the air downstream of the curtain was measured using a pitot tube. The fluid dynamic behaviour of the particle curtain was analysed using a Eulerian–Eulerian computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model that is capable of predicting the complete flow fields of the gas and particles. Also, a simple single particle model was used to predict the particle velocity at the centerline and trajectories of the leading and trailing edges of the particle curtains falling in a horizontal air flow. Good agreement was found between the experiments and the CFD model predictions. However, predictions from the simple single particle model were less satisfactory due primarily to the non-uniform gas flow found in practice, compared to the assumed uniform flow...|$|R
