Through-wall cracks of varying lengths have been inserted into the plate along the weld centre-line, and the non-linear <b>crack</b> driving <b>force</b> due to {{residual stress}} evaluated using three formulations of the J-integral: the standard ABAQUS J, the G-theta approach coded into SYSWELD, and a modified J-integral, J mod, that retains its path independence under non-proportional loading. Cracks were introduced into the FE meshes either simultaneously (all crack flank nodes released in the same step) or progressively (crack opened in small increments from mid-length to tip). The results were compared with <b>crack</b> driving <b>force</b> estimates made using linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) and the R 6 procedure. The <b>crack</b> driving <b>forces</b> predicted by all three J-formulations agree well for simultaneous opening, showing that the <b>crack</b> driving <b>force</b> rises to a peak for a crack length equal to the weld length, and falls for longer cracks. Linear elastic fracture mechanics gives a good estimate of the <b>crack</b> driving <b>force</b> for very short defects (confirming the absence of elastic follow up), but is conservative for longer defects, overestimating the peak driving force by 20 %. The R 6 estimates, which incorporate plasticity corrections, are more conservative than LEFM, overestimating the peak <b>crack</b> driving <b>force</b> by up to 60 %.

Micrographs of the mesocarp slices have provided plausible explanation for the observed decline in the mechanical properties of the sterilised fruitlets.
