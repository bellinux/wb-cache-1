50|$|Bramah had {{designed}} a hydraulic press, but was having problems sealing both the piston and the piston rod where it fitted into the cylinder. The usual method was hemp packing but the pressures {{were too high}} for this to work. Maudslay {{came up with the}} idea of a leather <b>cup</b> <b>washer,</b> which gave a perfect seal but offered no resistance to movement when the pressure was released. The new hydraulic press worked perfectly thereafter. But Maudslay, who had made a major contribution to its success, received little credit for it.|$|E
50|$|Bushings {{are perhaps}} the easiest things to change on a truck in order to change the feel of how it turns. Bushings are usually made of a {{polyurethane}} material, and come in varying shapes and durometers (hardness). Two of the most standard bushing shapes include barrels and cones. Barrels, having a larger shape, are often thought to have more stability and rebound whereas cones, having a more narrow shape, allow for more turn and less rebound. The durometer of the bushing also greatly influences its characteristics. a harder bushing (such as a bushing with a rating around 97A) will be much harder to turn on than a softer bushing (something around 78A). The type of washers used with the bushing can also greatly affect the bushing's characteristics. While {{it depends on the}} size of the washer, generally a cupped washer will be the most restrictive on a bushing, a flat washer will be neutral, and a flipped <b>cup</b> <b>washer</b> will be the least restrictive.Another aspect of the longboard that has an influence on bushing performance is the bushing seat on the truck. The bushing seat is the area on the hangar where the bushing makes contact. This area often has a rim to cup the edge of the bushing, adding a small amount of restriction as the bushing deforms through a turn. Some trucks have very loose or even non-existent bushing seats, whereas others have very restrictive bushing seats, greatly reducing bushing deformation. More restrictive bushing seats generally found on trucks designed with faster riding in mind as they offer more stability and lean.|$|E
40|$|A captive {{fastener}} device is utilized to hold two members together. The device {{is comprised of}} a housing which may be securely attached to the first member. Within the housing is a spring which biases a bottom of a first lip of a <b>cup</b> <b>washer.</b> The top of the first lip contacts {{the top of the}} housing when the fastener is not engaged. The fastener has a ledge {{at the bottom of the}} fastener head which rests on a top surface of a second lip of the <b>cup</b> <b>washer.</b> The bottom surface of the second lip contacts the first member when the fastener has fully engaged the second member to secure the first and second members together. The first lip of the <b>cup</b> <b>washer</b> has a greater diameter than the second lip. The first lip also has a greater diameter than the fastener. When the fastener is not engaged, a top surface of the first lip engages a bottom surface of the top of the housing. The housing top has an access hole of smaller diameter than the outer diameter of the fastener head which retains the fastener within the housing when the fastener is not engaging the second member...|$|E
40|$|An {{inspection}} {{was made}} of the drive mechanisms for corrosion, crud, pitting, and activity. Localized crud deposits were found in the L- 5, F- 12, and H- 4 damper guide <b>cup</b> <b>washers.</b> Corrosion and pitting appeared slight. The gamma radiation level of the components ranged from 1 to 1900 mr/hr. Smear samples of the components indicated relatively low activity levels-the highest being 140 mr/ hr, gamma. The gamma emission spectrum for each smear sample showed the composition of all samples to be identical from Fe/sup 59 /, Co/sup 60 /, Mn/sup 54 /, Cr/sup 51 /, Hf/sup 181 /, and Zr/sup 95 /. T he specific activity was highest for Co/sup 60 / (1. 90 x 1 O/sup 7 / dpm/mg) and lowest for Zr/sup 95 / (2. 20 x 10 /sup 4 / dpm/mg). (B. O. G. ...|$|R
50|$|A Belleville washer, {{also known}} as a coned-disc spring, conical spring washer, disc spring, Belleville spring or <b>cupped</b> spring <b>washer,</b> is a conical shell which can be loaded along its axis either statically or dynamically. A Belleville washer is, then, a type of spring shaped like a washer. It is the {{frusto-conical}} shape that gives the washer a spring characteristic.|$|R
50|$|Piston seals were a {{perennial}} problem at this time. Those for large stationary engines, working at low pressures, were sealed {{by a variety}} of methods including leather <b>cup</b> <b>washers,</b> pools of standing water and even a poultice of cow dung. As working pressures increased, which had been an essential part of turning the steam engine into the steam locomotive, demands on the piston seal increased further. Pistons were now mostly sealed by having oakum rope wrapped around them in a groove, often smeared with tallow. Keeping the rope seal moist, thus swollen, was recognised as an important factor in achieving a good seal. As the steam spring cylinders were in {{the lower part of the}} boiler, below the water line, it was expected that they would seal well. Despite this, they continued to give trouble with leakage and were eventually removed and replaced with iron or steel leaf springs. Wood in 1831 illustrates one of the Killingworth locomotives, now fitted with metal leaf springs and also coupling rods.|$|R
40|$|Proposed set {{of tools}} neatly dimple <b>cup</b> <b>washer</b> to prevent screw from turning in {{mounting}} hole. Two dimples required, one leaning outward to grip recess in mounting hole and one leaning inward to grip recess in screw-head. Tools do not cause cracks and tears. Substitute die-forming process for hammer-and-center-punch process. De-forming process requires less skill and gives results of greater quality and consistency...|$|E
25|$|Metals {{and other}} solid {{materials}} expand upon heating and contract upon cooling. This is an undesirable occurrence in electrical systems. Copper {{has a low}} {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} for an electrical conducting material. Aluminium, an alternate common conductor, expands nearly one third more than copper under increasing temperatures. This higher degree of expansion, along with aluminiumâ€™s lower ductility, can cause electrical problems when bolted connections are improperly installed. By using proper hardware, such as spring pressure connections and <b>cupped</b> or split <b>washers</b> at the joint, {{it may be possible to}} create aluminium joints that compare in quality to copper joints.|$|R
