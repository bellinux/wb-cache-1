40|$|Contrast in image {{processing}} is typically scaled using a power function (gamma) where its exponent specifies {{the amount of}} the physical contrast change. While the exponent is normally constant for the whole image, we observe that such scaling leads to perceptual nonuniformity in the context of high dynamic range (HDR) images. This effect is mostly due to lower contrast sensitivity of the human eyes for the low luminance levels. Such levels can be reproduced by an HDR display while they can not be reproduced by standard display technology. We conduct two perceptual experiments on a complex image: <b>contrast</b> <b>scaling</b> and <b>contrast</b> discrimination threshold, and we derive a model which relates changes of physical and perceived contrasts at different luminance levels.

However, how the subjective experience of VSTM/imagery and its contrast modulate this process has not been investigated. We addressed this issue by asking participants to detect brief masked targets while they were engaged either in VSTM or visual imagery. Subjective experience of memory/imagery (strength scale), and the visual contrast of the memory/mental image (<b>contrast</b> <b>scale)</b> were assessed on a trial-by-trial basis. For both VSTM and imagery, contrast of the memory/mental image was positively associated with reporting target presence. Consequently, at the sensory level, both VSTM and imagery facilitated visual perception. However, subjective strength of VSTM was positively associated with visual detection whereas the opposite pattern was found for imagery. Thus the relationship between subjective strength of memory/imagery and visual detection are qualitatively different for VSTM and visual imagery, although their impact at the sensory level appears similar. Our results furthermore demonstrate that imagery and VSTM are partly dissociable processes. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Brazilian {{versions}} of instruments to evaluate non-verbal memory are scarce. The Visual Reproduction (VR) subscales I and II of the Wechsler Memory Scale {{are considered the}} gold standard among memory assessment measures. The aim {{of the present study}} was to develop a cross-cultural adaptation of the Visual Reproduction subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale–fourth edition (VR-IV), suitable for Brazil, and to evaluate its preliminary psychometric properties. Method: Participant assessment and data analysis followed the methodology recommended by the American Educational Research Association, the American Psychological Association, and the National Council on Measurement in Education (2009). Eighty-five healthy adult volunteers and 29 adult right-middle cerebral artery (RMCA) stroke patients were evaluated. The adaptation of the VR-IV involved a group of experts and translators who analysed conceptual, item, semantic, and operational equivalence. Some psychometric properties of the instrument were also evaluated. Results: All the equivalence categories were achieved in the Portuguese adaptation. Significant healthy group correlation coefficients were also obtained. Scale reliability analyses showed moderate correlations that indicated the temporal stability of the instrument. The RMCA stroke patients obtained lower raw scores in all tasks of the VR-IV in comparison to the control group. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the Portuguese adaptation of the VR-IV has cultural reliability and validity for use in Brazil. The performance of the RMCA stroke patients and paired controls was best evaluated using <b>contrast</b> <b>scaled</b> scores, in comparison to the performance using each variable separately. The <b>contrast</b> <b>scaled</b> scores enabled the observation that the RMCA stroke patients had limitations in encoding and retrieving learning information...|$|R
40|$|Textures within real images vary in brightness, <b>contrast,</b> <b>scale</b> and skew as imaging {{conditions}} change. To enable {{recognition of}} textures in real images, {{it is necessary}} to employ a similarity measure which is invariant to these properties. Furthermore, since textures often appear on undulating surfaces, such invariances must necessarily be local rather than global. Despite these requirements, it is only relatively recently that texture recognition algorithms with local scale and affine invariance properties have begun to be reported. Typically, they comprise detecting feature points followed by geometric normalization prior to description. We describe a method based on invariant combinations of linear filters. Unlike previous methods, we introduce a novel family of filters, which provide scale invariance, resulting in a texture description invariant to local changes in orientation, contrast and scale and robust to local skew. Significantly, the family of filters enable local scale invariants to be defined without using a scale selection principle or a large number of filters. A texture discrimination method based on the A 2 similarity measure applied to histograms derived from our filter responses outperforms existing methods for retrieval and classification results for both the Brodatz textures and the UIUC database, which has been designed to require local invariance...|$|E

It {{is one of the}} most difficult tasks which should be conducted in the proposed method of facial asymmetry measuring. In the case of while searching chosen points in the eye or mouth area, analysed areas are characterized by large contrast between certain elements in the level of colour or greyscale. Such big differences in <b>contrast</b> <b>scale</b> are not observed in the nose area. That is why the depth of the luminance level is taken into consideration. The difficulty of analysis results from the fact that the searched nose area changes its position in various people. There is no ideal way to identify clearly which area should be searched. The proposed scheme of determining area assumes that the area would be designated by localized centres of the eyes (the width d) and also by the vertical distance from 0.8 k to 0.8 d, where d is the distance between the centres of the eyes and k is the distance between the inner corners of the eyes (see Fig. 1). Such division results from taken tests based on available pictures. It happens, however, that among some people, the proposed scheme omits searched points of the nose, so the calibration of system settings is necessary, dedicated to a user.|$|E
40|$|AbstractDouble E 2 N 2 scaling, i. e. {{magnifying}} {{size and}} contrast, allows modelling of {{the deterioration of}} face recognition performance with increasing eccentricity (E) and the size (N) of the set from which a target face has to be identified. E 2 and N 2 values represent the eccentricities and set sizes at which stimulus size and contrast must double {{in order to keep}} performance unchanged, whilst parameter K represents the multiplicative interaction between E and N. In the current study we investigated whether double E 2 N 2 scaling can model performance deterioration with increasing eccentricity and set size in letter perception too. Contrast sensitivity for letter perception was investigated as a function of letter size at N= 1 – 8 and E= 0 °– 10 °. The superimposition of contrast sensitivity functions produced two scaling surfaces, one for letter size and another for contrast, which allowed modelling of the changes in letter perception with increasing E and N. With increasing eccentricity/set size the change of scale was much faster for contrast than letter size. Thus, in letter perception, contrast scaling was more important than spatial scaling. When compared with face perception, the change of spatial scale with increasing eccentricity was slower for letters whereas the change of <b>contrast</b> <b>scale</b> was similar for both. With increasing set size the changes of both spatial and contrast scales are faster for faces. In spatial scaling the interaction between eccentricity and set size was similar for letters and faces whereas in contrast scaling letters showed no interaction. Thus, letter perception was less affected by eccentricity and set size than face perception...|$|E

40|$|The Standard Cosmological Model is {{generally}} {{accepted by the}} scientific community, there are still an amount of unresolved issues. From the observable characteristics of the structures in the Universe,it {{should be possible to}} impose constraints on the cosmological parameters. Cosmic Voids (CV) are a major component of the LSS and have been shown to possess great potential for constraining DE and testing theories of gravity. But a gap between CV observations and theory still persists. A theoretical model for void statistical distribution as a function of size exists (SvdW) However, the SvdW model has been unsuccesful in reproducing the results obtained from cosmological simulations. This undermines the possibility of using voids as cosmological probes. The goal of our thesis work is to cover the gap between theoretical predictions and measured distributions of cosmic voids. We develop an algorithm to identify voids in simulations,consistently with theory. We inspecting the possibilities offered by a recently proposed refinement of the SvdW (the Vdn model, Jennings et al., 2013). Comparing void catalogues to theory, we validate the Vdn model, finding that it is reliable over a large range of radii, at all the redshifts considered and for all the cosmological models inspected. We have then searched for a size function model for voids identified in a distribution of biased tracers. We find that, naively applying the same procedure used for the unbiased tracers to a halo mock distribution does not provide success- full results, suggesting that the Vdn model requires to be reconsidered when dealing with biased samples. Thus, we test two alternative exten- sions of the model and find that two scaling relations exist: both the Dark Matter void radii and the underlying Dark Matter density <b>contrast</b> <b>scale</b> with the halo-defined void radii. We use these findings to develop a semi-analytical model which gives promising results...|$|E

It shows the relationship of the golden section to Fibonacci sequence. It introduces the history of the golden section from the oldest studies up to present. It deals with the occurrence of the golden section in nature, both in living organisms, and within the human body. It explains the use of the golden section in art, more specifically in the composition of the work of art (the location of important elements in the painting). Furthermore, the thesis deals with the golden section measurement method and includes a measurement tool together with instructions for making it.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the concept of}} filling the air gaps of the conventional contrast detail phantom (CDP) with various concentrations of contrast media, {{and to develop a}} variable level of attenuation-level differential phantoms that could be more appropriate for contrast measurements in some radiology cases. Methods: Images were acquired using the digital radiography system of the traditional CDP (Perspex/air hole phantom) and the novel form of CDP where the air holes were replaced with attenuating material. In this study, two different attenuating materials were introduced, water and a 30 % concentration of iodine-based contrast medium. Image quality was assessed using automated processing to calculate the image quality factor (IQF) inv. Results and Discussion: Phantom studies indicate that lower contrast levels are obtained when CDP holes are filled with water and a 30 % concentration of iodine contrast media than those observed for air/Perspex or traditional CDP. As an example, when a 5 -mAs beam is used the IQFinv values are 5. 32 in the case of air filling the holes; however, when these holes are filled with water under the same conditions, the value of the IQFinv drops to 2. 55, and to 2. 83 when 30 % of contrast media is used. Other concentrations were also tested. These results indicate {{that it is possible to}} extend the <b>contrast</b> <b>scale</b> in these phantoms to include ranges that are more realistic for a patient&# 039;s body than just air and tissue-equivalent material. Conclusions: These findings indicate that the proposed extension of the contrast scales allows smaller changes in contrast to be discerned. This is due to the small attenuation differences of the subject materials (e. g, 30 % contrast liquid and wax) from the traditional form of CDP (material/air). This suggests that the low form of the CDP may have a useful role in assessing image quality in planar radiology as an evaluation tool to better represent low-subject contrast imaging requirem...|$|E
