500|$|The basionym {{for this}} species is Simblum periphragmoides, first {{described}} by German mycologist Johann Friedrich Klotzsch in 1831, based on specimens collected in Bois Chéry in Mauritius. Klotzsch designated {{it as the}} type species of Simblum, a genus differentiated from the similar genus Lysurus by having the fruit body ending in a spherical, <b>chambered</b> <b>head,</b> with gleba developing within the depressions of the chambers. Lysurus periphragmoides is a morphologically variable species; as a result, it has acquired an extensive number of synonyms, as various authors have decided that the different forms warranted being designated as new species. Donald Malcolm Dring's 1980 monograph on the Clathraceae (a family that has since been [...] into the Phallaceae) transferred the taxon to Lysurus, explaining [...] "a distinction between [...] "Simblum" [...] and Lysurus in the original restricted sense cannot be easily maintained because there are examples of intermediates states", and he lumped 18 synonyms under L.periphragmoides.|$|E
5000|$|Dodge {{released}} a 325 cuin L engine for 1957. The engine used a 3.6875 in bore and 3.80 in stroke.The base engine offering {{was now a}} polyspheric <b>chambered</b> <b>head</b> referenced as 'KDS', and a higher performance 325 was offered with hemi heads as the 'KD-500'. Again there was a low volume offering of a 'KD-500-1' with dual four barrel carburetors. All engines now, however, had hydraulic camshafts even though the hemi headed offerings sported [...] "dimples" [...] in the valve covers for mechanical adjuster clearance.|$|E
50|$|The engine {{made its}} {{official}} debut at the Geneva Motor Show {{in the new}} 1962 Renault Floride S, replacing the 845cc 40 hp Dauphine Gordini. The 956cc capacity, which delivered a dozen additional horsepower, (51 hp SAE),a few months later {{was seen in the}} new R8 sedan. For racing and motorsport versions, Amédée Gordini was responsible for designing a hemispherical combustion <b>chambered</b> <b>head</b> allowing 85-90 hp for a 1000cc version as opposed to 70 hp for the previous 700cc Gordini engine. Gordini revealed some weaknesses in the rigidity of the block which could lead to blown head gaskets; this prompted Renault to stiffen the block slightly.|$|E

5000|$|The 335 series engines {{used one}} of two {{different}} cylinder heads. The 4V (four venturi) head was used on engines equipped with a four-barrel carburetor while the 2V (two venturi) head was used with the engines equipped with two-barrel carburetors. The 4V heads had larger ports and valves than the 2V, but the 2V heads still had ports and valves that were significantly larger than Windsor engines. [...] The 4V head's large ports and valves were designed to promote better breathing at high rpm, while the smaller 2V ports {{have proven to be}} better for street use. [...] The cylinder heads used either an open, almost shallow hemispherical combustion chamber or a closed [...] "quench" [...] type combustion chamber. The closed <b>chamber</b> <b>heads</b> enclose the valves more closely, reducing the combustion chamber volume, but both combustion chamber designs have the same thermal efficiency and resistance to detonation. The closed combustion chamber promotes a better swirling action of the incoming air fuel mixture which provides a low-rpm torque advantage over the open chamber. However, the open <b>chamber</b> cylinder <b>heads</b> exhibit better emissions characteristics. The other significant advantage to the closed <b>chamber</b> <b>heads</b> is that less machining is required to obtain high compression ratios.|$|R

50|$|The {{combination}} of the closed <b>chamber</b> <b>heads</b> with the small 2V ports has caused the 302C head to be a bolt-on-performance upgrade for other 335 series V8s. Having the smallest combustion chamber of the 335 series V8s, these cylinder heads will easily boost the static compression ratio of any other 335 series V8. In addition, the small ports used on these head are more efficient for a street performance engine, than the large port 4V heads that tend to favour performance only at higher engine speeds.|$|R
