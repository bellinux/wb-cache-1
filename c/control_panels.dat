5|$|A {{maximum of}} 15 Desk Accessories may be {{installed}} at one time, including the Chooser, Scrapbook, and Control Panel. System 6 uses the Control Panel desk accessory to access all the installed <b>control</b> <b>panels,</b> which imposes severe user interface limitations. Desk Accessories cannot be installed or removed within the Finder; this requires the Font/DA Mover utility. System 7 also fixed this. <b>Control</b> <b>panels,</b> however, {{are contained in}} separate files.|$|E
5|$|The third {{scenario}} {{involved an}} explosion at {{a nuclear reactor}} facility which shuts down two of three reactors. Everyone is killed in the disaster and scientists must send in an aerial robot to find the operating reactor building, enter the building (or send in a sensor probe/subvehicle) and relay pictures of the <b>control</b> <b>panels</b> {{to determine if a}} melt-down is imminent. The scientists are forced to maintain a 3 kilometer stand-off distance due to the extreme radiation hazard.|$|E
5|$|Marble Madness was {{developed}} by Atari Games, with Mark Cerny as the lead designer and Bob Flanagan as the software engineer. Both Cerny and Flanagan handled programming the game. It uses the Atari System 1 hardware, an interchangeable system of circuit boards, <b>control</b> <b>panels,</b> and artwork. The game features pixel graphics on a 19-inch Electrohome G07 model CRT monitor, and uses a Motorola 68010 central processing unit (CPU) with a MOS Technology 6502 subsystem to control the audio and coin operations. Marble Madness was Atari's first game to use an FM sound chip produced by Yamaha, {{which is similar to}} a Yamaha DX7 synthesizer and creates the music in real time so that it is in synchronization with the game's on-screen action. The game's music was composed by Brad Fuller and Hal Canon who spent a few months becoming familiar with the capabilities of the sound chip.|$|E

50|$|The {{operation}} of the 421 was directed {{by the use of}} a removable <b>control</b> <b>panel</b> and a carriage tape. By means of the <b>control</b> <b>panel,</b> any column of the card could be wired to any print column, by means of a wire link (the end terminals of which were inserted into slots in the <b>control</b> <b>panel).</b> When the <b>control</b> <b>panel</b> wiring was complete, the <b>control</b> <b>panel</b> was inserted into the guides in the machine, and a hand-operated lever moved the <b>control</b> <b>panel</b> so that the wire links made contact with corresponding terminals in the machine.|$|R

25|$|In January 2017, the Japan Sanitary Equipment Industry Association {{agreed to}} {{standardize}} the iconography {{used on the}} <b>control</b> <b>panels</b> for Japanese toilets, {{in an attempt to}} reduce confusion of foreign visitors to the country.|$|E
25|$|In January 2017, The Japan Sanitary Equipment Industry Association, a {{consortium}} of companies producing plumbing products including Toto Ltd., Panasonic, and Toshiba, has agreed to unify the iconography used on the often baffling <b>control</b> <b>panels</b> for Japanese toilets. The toilet manufacturers plan to implement the eight new pictogram on models released from this year onward, {{with a view to}} the system becoming an international standard.|$|E
25|$|Kragujevac {{has been}} an {{important}} industrial and trading center of Serbia for more than two centuries, known for its automotive and firearms industries. The former state-owned Zastava Automobiles company was purchased by Fiat in 2008, and renamed Fiat Serbia. Fiat was joined by partners Magneti Marelli (exhaust systems and <b>control</b> <b>panels),</b> Johnson Controls (car seats and interiors), Sigit (thermoplastic and rubber components) and HTL (wheels).|$|E

25|$|Hopper's crew have {{repaired}} the ship, and the Doctor rewires {{the controls}} {{to the station}} so they are inactive. He then sets up a circuit to electrify the doors again, along with the <b>control</b> <b>panels</b> and the hatch. The Controller, still alive, advances towards them. Everyone tries to shut the outer doors using insulating poles, but the Controller is too strong. Toberman closes the doors, completing the circuit, and both he and the Controller are electrocuted.|$|E
25|$|Premium {{editions of}} Windows Vista include a {{redesigned}} user interface and visual style, named Windows Aero (Authentic, Energetic, Reflective and Open). Aero {{is intended to}} be cleaner and more aesthetically pleasing than previous Windows versions, including glass-like transparencies and window animations. Windows Aero also features a new default font (Segoe UI) with a slightly larger size, a streamlined style for wizards, and a change in the tone and phrasing of most of the dialogs and <b>control</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another notable System 7 {{feature is}} {{built-in}} cooperative multitasking. In System Software 6, this function was optional through the MultiFinder. System 7 also introduced aliases, similar to symbolic links on Unix, shortcuts that {{were introduced in}} later versions of Microsoft Windows, and shadows in IBM OS/2. System extensions were enhanced by being moved to their own subfolder; a subfolder in the System Folder was also created for the <b>control</b> <b>panels.</b> In System 7.5, Apple includes the Extensions Manager, a previously third-party program which simplified the process of enabling and disabling extensions.|$|E

25|$|Commercial smoke {{detectors}} are either conventional or addressable, and {{are connected to}} security alarm or fire alarm systems controlled by fire alarm <b>control</b> <b>panels</b> (FACP). These {{are the most common}} type of detector, and are usually significantly more expensive than single-station battery-operated residential smoke alarms. They are used in most commercial and industrial facilities and other places such as ships and trains, but are also part of some security alarm systems in homes. These detectors don't need to have built in alarms, as alarm systems can be controlled by the connected FACP, which will set off relevant alarms, and can also implement complex functions such as a staged evacuation.|$|E
25|$|Stage 7 {{was where}} the Enterprise-B's bridge, {{deflector}} room and corridors were built and filmed. The jolts and shocks of the ship in the hold of the energy ribbon were created by camera bumps and motors to shake the set. Filming of the scenes took place in April 1994, while residents were still skittish from the recent 1994 Northridge earthquake; the effects staff deliberately hid the set shakers until cameras were rolling to elecit more genuine reactions. The Amargosa observatory set was an elaborate redress of the Enterprise-B bridge, with an added back room, second level, and swapped walls changing the layout to appear a different setting. <b>Control</b> <b>panels</b> styled after those in the original Star Trek television series helped suggest {{the age of the}} station.|$|E
25|$|At 16:00, the CVR {{showed that}} Captain Tsu left the cockpit; five seconds later, the CVR stopped recording. Tests {{indicated}} that a click would be heard on the CVR recording if the CVR circuit breaker had tripped normally, but not {{if it had been}} pulled out manually. As there was no click, it is likely that Captain Tsu pulled out the CVR circuit breaker before leaving the cockpit. The NTSC and NTSB investigators thought that if Captain Tsu was responsible for the crash, he must have made up some excuse to get the First Officer to leave the flightdeck prior to disabling the FDR (which would have immediately triggered a Master Caution on both pilots' <b>control</b> <b>panels),</b> so his actions would not be noticed. Several minutes later, as recorded by Indonesian ground radar, the aircraft entered a rapid descent, disintegrated, and crashed into the Musi River.|$|E

25|$|Some modern amateur {{transceivers}} have embedded {{computers with}} firmware which is executed {{to provide the}} functions and features of the transceiver. This software must be provided by the original manufacturer of the equipment. Another type of software is that required to control a receiver (or transceiver) without a front panel provided. Examples of this are the Kenwood TS-B2000 and the Ten-Tec Pegasus; both transceivers are sold with PC software to provide the human interface for operation. Most transceivers with front <b>control</b> <b>panels</b> (and many receivers popular among shortwave listeners) have a computer interface such as a serial port, USB or Ethernet port. These ports are useful for satellite-tracking frequency control (Doppler tuning), station logging, digital operation, internet and special-needs accessibility. In many cases, the software adds improved or extra functions and features beyond that provided by the original design. For this reason, some operators purchase radio-control software for non-computerized operation even if their radio has a front control panel.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{microwave}} ovens use either an analog dial-type timer or a digital control panel for operation. <b>Control</b> <b>panels</b> feature an LED, liquid crystal or vacuum fluorescent display, in the 90s brands such as Panasonic and GE began offering models with a scrolling-text display showing cooking instructions, numeric buttons for entering the cook time, a power level selection feature and other possible {{functions such as}} a defrost setting and pre-programmed settings for different food types, such as meat, fish, poultry, vegetables, frozen vegetables, frozen dinners, and popcorn. In most ovens, the magnetron is driven by a linear transformer which can only feasibly be switched completely on or off. As such, the choice of power level {{does not affect the}} intensity of the microwave radiation; instead, the magnetron is cycled on and off every few seconds, thus altering the large scale duty cycle. Newer models have inverter power supplies that use pulse-width modulation to provide effectively continuous heating at reduced power, so that foods are heated more evenly at a given power level and can be heated more quickly without being damaged by uneven heating.|$|E
500|$|The entire game, {{including}} {{the tools and}} libraries, was written from scratch. A trial and error approach was taken: the team learned by trying something and changing what did not work. They avoided using <b>control</b> <b>panels,</b> icons and buttons for casting miracles, preferring a gesture system. Molyneux commented {{that he would have}} been very disappointed if the system was dumped, but in the end, they got the feature working [...] "beautifully". Integrating the storyline was found to draw the player through the game in an unexpected manner, which {{led to the development of}} characters like Sable, the Creature trainer, and the advisers. A great deal of effort was devoted to getting features such as the weather import working.|$|E

2500|$|Adding {{greatly to}} the {{severity}} of the problem, is the system used to add functionality to the operating system itself, which relies on a patching mechanism known as CDEVs and INITs, commonly known as <b>Control</b> <b>Panels,</b> and Extensions. Third party developers also make use of this mechanism to add features, including [...] screensavers and a hierarchal Apple menu, independently of Apple. Some of these third-party <b>control</b> <b>panels</b> became almost universal, like the popular After Dark screensaver package. Since there was no standard for use of these patches, {{it is not uncommon for}} several of these add-ons—including Apple's own additions to the OS—to use the same patches, and interfere with each other, leading to more crashing.|$|E
