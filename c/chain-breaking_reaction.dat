40|$|The {{asymptotic}} {{structure of}} laminar, moderately rich, premixed methane flames is analyzed using a reduced chemical-kinetic mechanism comprising four global reactions. This reduced mechanism {{is different from}} those employed in previous asymptotic analyses of stoichiometric and lean flames, because a steady-state approxi-mation is not introduced for CH 3. The aim of the present analysis is to develop an asymptotic model for rich flames, which can predict the rapid decrease of the burning velocity with increasing equivalence ratio f. In the analysis, the flame structure is presumed to consist of three zones: a preheat zone with a normalized thickness {{of the order of}} unity, a thin reaction zone, and a postflame zone. The preheat zone is presumed to be chemically inert, and in the postflame zone the products are in chemical equilibrium and the temperature is equal to the adiabatic flame temperature Tb. In the reaction zone the chemical reactions are presumed to take place in two layers: the inner layer and the oxidation layer. The rate constants of these reactions are evaluated at T 0, which is the characteristic temperature at the inner layer. In the inner layer the dominant reactions taking place are those between the fuel and radicals, and between CH 3 and the radicals. An important difference between the structure of the inner layer of rich flames and that of lean flames analyzed previously is the enhanced influence of the <b>chain-breaking</b> <b>reaction</b> CH 3 1 H 1 (M) 3 CH 4 1 (M) in rich flames. Here M represents any third body. This reaction decreases the concentration of H radicals, which in turn decreases the values of the burnin...|$|E
40|$|Butyl rubber (isobutylene–isoprene–rubber, IIR) was {{functionalized}} in solution with a nitroxide moiety {{taking advantage}} of the unsaturations present in the isoprene units of IIR, and was further grafted with maleic anhydride (MA) or styrene–MA (SMA) to produce IIR-g-MA and IIR-g-SMA. In one of the functionalization techniques used, the molecular structure of the IIR was preserved as the <b>chain-breaking</b> <b>reactions</b> are prevented from occurring. The resulting graft copolymers were tested as compatiblizers/impact modifiers blended with Nylon- 6, {{and one of them was}} preliminarily tested as a coupling agent in the preparation of nanocomposites of IIR and an organo-clay. Blends of PA- 6 /IIR-g-MA exhibited a significant increase in impact resistance at increasing loads of the modified IIR, as well as a good rubber particle dispersion in the polyamide matrix. On the other hand, the performance of IIR-g-SMA as an impact modifier of PA, or as a coupling agent in the preparation of rubber-organoclay nanocomposites, is marginal...|$|R
40|$|The {{action of}} {{halogenated}} agents in preventing flame propagation in fuel-air mixtures in laboratory tests {{is discussed in}} terms of a possible chemical mechanism. The mechanism chosen is that of <b>chain-breaking</b> <b>reactions</b> between agent and active particles (hydrogen and oxygen atoms and hydroxyl radicsls). Data from the literature on the flammability peaks of n-heptane agent-air mixtures are treated. Ratings of agent effectiveness in terms of the fuel equivalent of the agent, based on both fuel and agent concentrations at the peak, are proposed as preferable to ratings in terms of agent concentration alone. These fuel-equivalent ratings are roughly correlated by reactivities assigned to halogen and hydrogen atoms in the agent molecules. It is concluded that the presence of hydrogen in agent need not reduce its fire-fighting ability, provided there is enough halogen to make the agent nonflammable. A method is presented for estimating from quenching-distance data a rate constant for the reaction of agent with active particles. A quantitative result is obtained for methyl bromide. This rate constant predicts the observed peak concentration of methyl bromide quite well. However, more data are needed to prove the validity of the method. The assumption that hal. ogenatedagents act mainly by chain-bresking reactions with active particles is consistent with the experimental facts and should help guide the selection of agents for further tests...|$|R
40|$|High-level {{ab initio}} {{molecular}} orbital theory calculations {{have been used}} to study self-healing mechanism of materials based on thiuram disulfides and their derivatives (S=C(Z) S–SC(Z) =S, for Z = CH 3, NEt 2, N(Et) CH 2 CH 2 OH, Ph, Bz), and the effects of these Z-substituents on their efficacy. The relative contributions of cross-over and reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer reactions were ascertained, and the likelihood of <b>chain-breaking</b> side <b>reactions</b> was assessed. To rationalize the results, the various stabilization energies of the radicals and closed-shell species were also evaluated. The study revealed that the self-healing mechanism of thiuram disulfides follows predominantly the cross-over reaction because of the high energies of intermediate radicals in the chain transfer mechanism. Based on the study, the most effective self-healing materials are predicted to contain amines as Z-groups, while those containing benzyl and its derivatives are most likely to undergo side reactions...|$|R
40|$|High-level {{ab initio}} {{molecular}} orbital calculations {{are used to}} study the thermodynamics and electrochemistry relevant to the mechanism of atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). Homolytic bond dissociation energies (BDEs) and standard reduction potentials (SRPs) are reported {{for a series of}} alkyl halides (R-X; R = CH 2 CN, CH(CH 3) CN, C(CH 3) 2 CN, CH 2 COOC 2 H 5, CH(CH 3) COOCH 3, C(CH 3) 2 COOCH 3, C(CH 3) 2 COOC 2 H 5, CH 2 Ph, CH(CH 3) Ph, CH(CH 3) Cl, CH(CH 3) OCOCH 3, CH(Ph) COOCH 3, SO 2 Ph, Ph; X = Cl, Br, I) both in the gas phase and in two common organic solvents, acetonitrile and dimethylformamide. The SRPs of the corresponding alkyl radicals, R•, are also examined. The computational results are in a very good agreement with the experimental data. For all alkyl halides examined, it is found that, in the solution phase, one-electron reduction results in the fragmentation of the R-X bond to the corresponding alkyl radical and halide anion; hence it may be concluded that a hypothetical outer-sphere electron transfer (OSET) in ATRP should occur via concerted dissociative electron transfer rather than a two-step process with radical anion intermediates. Both the homolytic and heterolytic reactions are favored by electronwithdrawing substituents and/or those that stabilize the product alkyl radical, which explains why monomers such as acrylonitrile and styrene require less active ATRP catalysts than vinyl chloride and vinyl acetate. The rate constant of the hypothetical OSET reaction between bromoacetonitrile and CuI/TPMA complex was estimated using Marcus theory for the electron-transfer processes. The estimated rate constant kOSET = 10 - 11 M- 1 s- 1 is significantly smaller than the experimentally measured activation rate constant (kISET = 82 M- 1 s- 1 at 25 °C in acetonitrile) for the concerted atom transfer mechanism (inner-sphere electron transfer, ISET), implying that the ISET mechanism is preferred. For monomers bearing electron-withdrawing groups, the one-electron reduction of the propagating alkyl radical to the carbanion is thermodynamically and kinetically favored over the one-electron reduction of the corresponding alkyl halide unless the monomer bears strong radical-stabilizing groups. Thus, for monomers such as acrylates, catalysts favoring ISET over OSET are required in order to avoid <b>chain-breaking</b> side <b>reactions...</b>|$|R
40|$|Chemical Equation Presented) Hydroquinones (benzene- 1, 4 -diols) are {{naturally}} occurring <b>chain-breaking</b> antioxidants, whose <b>reactions</b> with peroxyl radicals yield 1, 4 -semiquinone radicals. Unlike the 1, 2 -semiquinone radicals derived from catechols (benzene- 1, 2 -diols), the 1, 4 -semiquinone radicals {{do not always}} trap another peroxyl radical, and instead the stoichiometric factor of hydroquinones varies widely between 0 and 2 {{as a function of}} ring-substitution and reaction conditions. This variable antioxidant behavior has been attributed to the competing reaction of the 1, 4 -semiquinone radical with molecular oxygen. Herein we report the results of experiments and theoretical calculations focused on understanding this key reaction. Our experiments, which include detailed kinetic and mechanistic investigations by laser flash photolysis and inhibited autoxidation studies, and our theoretical calculations, which include detailed studies of the reactions of both 1, 4 -semiquinones and 1, 2 -semiquinones with O 2, provide many important insights. They show that the reaction of O 2 with 2, 5 -di-tert-butyl- 1, 4 -semiquinone radical (used as model compound) has a rate constant of 2. 4 1 0. 9 7 105 M - 1 s- 1 in acetonitrile and as high as 2. 0 1 0. 9 7 106 M- 1 s- 1 in chlorobenzene, i. e., similar to that previously reported in water at pH 2 ̆ 23 c 7. These results, considered alongside our theoretical calculations, suggest that the reaction occurs by an unusual hydrogen atom abstraction mechanism, taking place in a two-step process consisting first of addition of O 2 to the semiquinone radical and second an intramolecular H-atom transfer concerted with elimination of hydroperoxyl to yield the quinone. This reaction appears to be much more facile for 1, 4 -semiquinones than for their 1, 2 -isomers. 9 2008 American Chemical Society. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
