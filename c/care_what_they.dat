5|$|While {{trying on}} her bridesmaid's dress in the TGS fitting room, Colleen, Sylvia Rossitano (Patti LuPone), and Verna Maroney (Jan Hooks) criticize Liz {{for not being}} married by now as she is in her late thirties, but Liz does not <b>care</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> think. Later, Liz has a {{conversation}} with her mother Margaret Lemon (Anita Gillette) regarding Liz being single. During their conversation, Margaret reveals that her true love was Buzz Aldrin and not Liz's father Dick Lemon (Buck Henry), which shocks Liz. She tells Jack about what her mother has revealed to her and ponders why her mother did not choose to be with Buzz. Jack offers to introduce her to Buzz with Liz accepting, and wanting {{to find out what}} her mother missed out on. During their meet, Buzz confesses {{that it was a good}} decision that Margaret did not stay with him as he spent many of his years as an alcoholic. After her encounter with Buzz, Liz tells her mother that she respects the decision she made by not ending up with Buzz.|$|E

Einheit {{and had him}} come to Chicago in January 1996 to work on some tracks together. [...] Konietzko also brought {{in a number of}} Wax Trax! alumni, such as Chris Connelly of Revolting Cocks and Bill Rieflin of Ministry, to help with the album's creation, along with assistance from more than a dozen studio musicians. Konietzko required all the album's contributors to be on call thirteen hours a day during production, saying [...] "I don't <b>care</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> do on their own time, but when they do KMFDM, if they don't comply with the schedule, they're out." ...|$|E

500|$|Carte {{was deeply}} {{affected}} {{by the death of}} his son Michael in 1932, discussed below. [...] The actor Martyn Green said, [...] "The heart dropped right out of him. [...] His interest in both the operas and the hotel seemed to fade away." [...] Nevertheless, in 1934 the company made a highly successful eight-month North American tour with Green as its new principal comedian, replacing Henry Lytton. [...] Carte gave approval for, and was closely consulted about, a 1938 film version of The Mikado produced and conducted by Geoffrey Toye, starring Green and released by Universal Pictures, but his only new stage production after 1932 was of The Yeomen of the Guard designed in 1939 by Peter Goffin. The re-staging was regarded as radical, but when Goffin took fright at the storm of controversy, Carte told him, [...] "I don't <b>care</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> say about the production. I should care if they said nothing." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 2009, Gaga {{revealed}} that {{she planned to}} cancel {{the concept of the}} original shows of The Monster Ball Tour and start afresh. She felt that the revamp of the show was needed as the original tour was constructed in a very short span of time. Gaga recalled that after West and she split up for this tour, she was unsure if she could get a show together in time, but nevertheless wanted to promote The Fame Monster. Hence she was able to put together [...] "something that, in truth, I never would have done if I had a longer amount of time". The revamp of the tour was planned from the arena shows in the United Kingdom from February 2010. [...] "My team thinks I'm completely psychotic. But I don't fucking <b>care</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> think. [...] Well, just to give you an idea, the stage is about four {{times the size of the}} one we're on now and conceptually, it's completely different. One thing that has been lost over the past 10-15 years, in pop music, is the idea of showbiz. And this is definitely going to bring that back", clarified Gaga. According to James Montgomery of MTV, the show recalled the film musicals The Wizard of Oz (1939) and West Side Story (1961), the science-fiction film Metropolis (1927), and the television mini-series Angels in America (2003).|$|E

Paul Davies describes how he [...] "loved his maverick personality and contempt for orthodoxy", quoting Hoyle as saying [...] "I don't <b>care</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> think" [...] about his theories on discrepant redshift, and [...] "it is better to be interesting and wrong than boring and right".|$|E

2500|$|With a {{batch of}} new songs, the Replacements entered a {{warehouse}} in Roseville, Minnesota, to record their next album, with Twin/Tone co-owner Stark engineering. Westerberg wrote songs in stops and starts, so it took several sessions of recording to finish the album. Stark's meticulous approach to recording contrasted {{with that of the}} Replacements, often frustrating the band. In one session, Mars and Westerberg switched instruments, and the band began to improvise, with Westerberg repeatedly shouting, [...] "It's a hootenanny." [...] The band then declared it to be [...] "side one, track one" [...] of the new album. According to Stark, the recording [...] "was a complete joke {{from their point of view}} — they did not <b>care</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> delivered".|$|E
2500|$|After {{her first}} {{introduction}} to drums at her friend's house, Blackman began {{playing in the}} school band {{and was able to}} convince her parents to get her a drum set of her own while she was still only seven. [...] "Of course those would be broken up in a matter of days", Blackman says. [...] "The only thing I heard at home was, 'we don't know if you can play drums because one, they're noisy, and two, they're very expensive". Some people ask why she didn't study violin or flute like other girls. [...] "I learned very early on – when I was 13 – that when I concentrate on those attitudes, I don't make progress for myself", says Blackman. [...] "If they're not paying my mortgage, I don't <b>care</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> think".|$|E
2500|$|The Fremantle Jetty {{fell into}} disuse {{in the late}} 1890s due to the {{creation}} of the new Fremantle Harbour. Other factors also played a role in the demise of the Fremantle Long Jetty including the weather, geographical issues, and problems with how the port operated. All of these factors and more made the jetty a failure. It is also apparent that the users of this jetty found it and the port of Fremantle to be unsatisfactory. In 1892 in a letter to the owners of the Saranac, Captain [...] D.B. Shaw wrote: “Gentleman, I have been in a good many places in my time, but this is the worst damn hole I ever saw. The stevedores are half drunk all the time and don’t <b>care</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> do.

2500|$|In 1968, {{one year}} after their live debut and now dubbed the Stooges, the band signed with Elektra Records, again {{following}} in the footsteps of The Doors, who were Elektra's biggest act at the time (reportedly, Pop called Moe Howard to see if it was all right to call his band [...] "The Stooges," [...] to which Howard responded by merely saying [...] "I don't <b>care</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> call themselves, as long as they're not the Three Stooges!" [...] and hung up the phone). The Stooges' first album The Stooges, (on which Pop was credited as [...] "Iggy Stooge"), was produced by John Cale in New York in 1969. Both it and the follow-up, Fun House produced by Don Gallucci in Los Angeles in 1970, sold poorly. Though the release of Fun House did not receive the recognition it expected, it was later ranked #191 in Rolling Stone's '500 Greatest Albums of All Time' in 2003. Shortly after the new members joined, the group disbanded because of Pop's worsening heroin addiction.|$|E
2500|$|The ADE 651 {{has been}} used at {{hundreds}} of Iraqi police and Iraqi military checkpoints across the country, often replacing physical inspections of vehicles. Major-General Jihad (also transliterated [...] "Jehad") al-Jabiri of the Interior Ministry's General Directorate for Combating Explosives has defended the device: [...] "Whether it's magic or scientific, what I care about is detecting bombs. I don't <b>care</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> say. I know more about bombs than the Americans do. In fact, I know more about bombs {{than anyone in the}} world." [...] He told a press conference that the ADE 651 has detected [...] "hundreds of roadside bombs and car bombs" [...] and any deficiencies were due to defective training in the device's use. The Iraqi Interior Minister, Jawad al-Bulani, also defended the device, telling Al Iraqiya television that the ADE 651 had [...] "managed to prevent and detect more than 16,000 bombs that would be a threat to people's life and more than 733 car bombs were defused." [...] He said: [...] "Iraq is considered as a market area for many companies producing such devices ... and there are other rival companies trying to belittle the efficiency of these instruments the government is buying".|$|E
