40|$|In this study, {{we propose}} a carrier {{time-of-flight}} technique {{to evaluate the}} <b>carrier</b> <b>transport</b> time across a quantum structure in an active region of solar cells. By observing the time-resolved photoluminescence signal with a quantum-well probe inserted under the quantum structure at forward bias, the <b>carrier</b> <b>transport</b> time can be efficiently determined at room temperature. The averaged drift velocity shows linear dependence on the internal field, allowing us to estimate the quantum structure as a quasi-bulk material with low effective mobility containing the information of carrier dynamics. We show that this direct and real-time observation is more sensitive to <b>carrier</b> <b>transport</b> than other conventional techniques, providing better insights into microscopic <b>carrier</b> <b>transport</b> dynamics to overcome a device design difficulty...|$|R

To precisely capture the dynamics of remote joule heating assisted <b>carrier</b> <b>transport,</b> MWCNTs are probed at nanosecond time scales.

30|$|Although CsA {{had been}} mostly {{used as a}} P-gp {{inhibitor}} {{in relation to the}} brain, in the periphery, it has been shown to inhibit transporters from the solute <b>carrier</b> membrane <b>transport</b> protein <b>group</b> as well [20],[21]. Since brain exposure of any molecule is a function of peripheral distribution, brain penetration, and metabolism, this fact has to be taken into consideration while assessing the results. Metabolic differences under different pretreatment conditions could be a critical factor in brain uptake levels, since non-identical free fraction of [11 C]AZ 10419369 in the blood leads to different availability of radioligand for transport across the BBB. Arterial blood sampling is generally used in PET experiments to measure changes in the free fraction over time. This is a rather difficult task in rodents, particularly in mice, in which the required blood volume would exceed the total blood volume of the animal. The effects of blood loss from arterial blood sampling could reduce the blood volume to such extent that it may alter metabolism, influence Vt, or even cause severe health issues which could lead to exsanguination and consequently to the death of the animal.|$|R

The <b>carrier</b> <b>transport</b> of the films in the low temperature regime (20 – 150 K) has been interpreted by implementing quantum correction to the conductivity. In the high temperature regime (200 – 300 K), the conduction mechanism has been successfully analyzed on the basis of Mott’s variable range hopping mechanism. Furthermore, it can be predicted that copper ions present at the surface of the crystallites are responsible for the hopping conduction mechanism...|$|R

3000|$|The low {{conductivity}} of Si-NCs {{embedded in}} dielectric films limits their {{applications for the}} manufacturing of optoelectronic devices.

In addition to impurity doping, {{the choice of the}} surrounding dielectric matrix also plays a crucial role in charge <b>carrier</b> <b>transport.</b> Although the formation of Si-NCs in the SiO 2 matrix has been investigated in detail [12, 15], the <b>carrier</b> <b>transport</b> ability in the Si-NC network is generally insufficient due to the large energy barrier of the surrounding oxide matrix. Charge <b>carrier</b> <b>transport</b> through narrower bandgap dielectrics, such as Si 3 N 4 or SiC, seems to be more feasible.
