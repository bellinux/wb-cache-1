40|$|Male Wistar rats {{sustaining}} prefrontal <b>cortex</b> <b>aspiration</b> or sham {{operation at}} 6 days or 30 days of age were {{submitted to the}} following behavioural tests: open-field, acquisition and retention of two-way active as well as passive avoidance tasks. In the open-field the locomotor activity proved enhanced in all the aspirated animals and this enhancement lasted for 30 days. In the two-day active avoidance task, an acquisition deficit was observed in both aspirated groups; but when retrained one month later, {{they were able to}} acquire the avoidance task like sham-operated rats and no difference appeared between the groups aspirated at 6 or at 30 days of age. Concerning the passive avoidance task, no difference could be detected between aspirated and sham-operated animals of both groups except that the rats aspirated at an early age (6 days) seemed to display a better avoidance ability in the retention test. These behavioural alterations (hyperactivity and impairment of the acquisition of the 2 -way active avoidance) resulted from the prefrontal <b>cortex</b> <b>aspiration,</b> at whatever age this aspiration was performed (6 days or 30 days). They disappeared after a postoperative recovery period of about one month, as evidenced by this longitudinal study...|$|E
40|$|THE PRESENT PROSPECTIVE STUDY CONCERNS 52 EYES WITH EXFOLIATION SYNDROME, WHICHUNDERWENT EXTRACAPSULAR CATARACT EXTRACTION WITH POSTERIOR CHAMBER INTRAOCULAR LENS IMPLANTATION. DURING THE PROSPECTIVE CLINICAL INVESTIGATION, A NUMBER OF PREOPERATIVE, INTRAOPERATIVE AND POSTOPERATIVE FACTORS HAVE BEEN STUDIED. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS HAS BEEN DONE USING THE "MULTIPLE REGRESSION" METHOD. A. RESULTS OF CLINICAL INTEREST ARE THE FOLLOWING: - SATISFACTORY PREOPERATIVE PUPILLARY DILATION (7 - 9 MM) HAS BEEN ACHIEVED IN 56 % OF THE EXAMINED EYES. - RUPTURE OF THE POSTERIOR LENS CAPSULE WAS OBSERVED IN 10 % OF THE CASES. - LENS IMPLANTATION WAS PERFORMED IN ALL 52 EYES (100 % OF THE CASES). ANTERIOR CHAMBER LENS WAS USED IN 2 CASES, WHILE IN THE REST 50 PATIENTS POSTERIOR CHAMBER LENSHAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY IMPLANTED. - INTENSIVE INFLAMMATORY REACTION WAS NOTED IN ONLY 44 % OF THE CASES. THIS FINDING CONTRADICTS THE VIEW THAT SEVERE INFLAMMATION IS ALWAYS PRESENT POSTOPERATIVELY IN PSEUDOEXFOLIATION CATARACT EXTRACTION. B. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS HAS GIVEN THE FOLLOWING STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANT RESULTS: - POSTERIOR LENS CAPSULE RUPTURE IS HIGHLY CONNECTED WITH THE EXCEEDINGTIME OF <b>CORTEX</b> <b>ASPIRATION</b> (P < 0. 001). - POSTERIOR LENS CAPSULE RUPTURE IS RELATED TO THE CATARACT SUBLUXATION (P = 0. 04). - DIFFICULTY IN PERFORMING CAPSULOTOMY IS OFTEN RELATED TO THE EXCEEDING TIME OF <b>CORTEX</b> <b>ASPIRATION</b> (P = 0. 02). - POSTOPERATIVE IRREGULARITIES OF THE PUPILLARY MARGINS ARE ASSOCIATED TO THELEVEL OF PREOPERATIVE INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE (P = 0. 04).

40|$|The {{contribution}} of anterior and posterior cingulate cortical areas to spatial learning and memory was examined in 4 experiments using the place-navigation task. Rats with complete bilateral cingulate <b>cortex</b> <b>aspiration</b> or aspiration of posterior cingulate cortex (area 29) alone could not swim {{directly to a}} hidden platform located in a fixed place. When animals with these lesions were tested for 40 d in a placealternation task in which they received 16 daily trials with the platform placed in a new location each day, they did not show reliable improvement in place navigation. The inability to swim to changing locations or to a single location was not overcome by preoperative training in these tasks. Rats with anterior cingulate cortex aspirations showed a less severe impairment in both tasks and, with more training than is necessary for control rats, they acquired near-normal placenavigatio...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAt mitosis onset, {{cortical}} tension {{increases and}} cells round up, ensuring correct spindle morphogenesis and orientation. Thus, cortical tension {{sets up the}} geometric requirements of cell division. On the contrary, cortical tension decreases during meiotic divisions in mouse oocytes, a puzzling observation because oocytes are round cells, stable in shape, that actively position their spindles. We investigated the pathway leading to reduction in cortical tension and its significance for spindle positioning. We document a previously uncharacterized Arp 2 / 3 -dependent thickening of the cortical F-actin essential for first meiotic spindle migration to the <b>cortex.</b> Using micropipette <b>aspiration,</b> we show that cortical tension decreases during meiosis I, resulting from myosin-II exclusion from the cortex, and that cortical F-actin thickening promotes cortical plasticity. These events soften and relax the cortex. They are triggered by the Mos-MAPK pathway and coordinated temporally. Artificial cortex stiffening and theoretical modelling demonstrate that a soft cortex is essential for meiotic spindle positioning...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectiveChondrocyte {{dedifferentiation}} {{is known}} to influence cell mechanics leading to alterations in cell function. This study examined the influence of chondrocyte dedifferentiation in monolayer on cell viscoelastic properties and associated changes in actin organisation, bleb formation and membrane-actin <b>cortex</b> interaction. MethodMicropipette <b>aspiration</b> was used to estimate the viscoelastic properties of freshly isolated articular chondrocytes and the same cells after passage in monolayer. Studies quantified the cell membrane-actin cortex adhesion by measuring the critical pressure required for membrane detachment and bleb formation. We then examined the expression of ezrin, radixin and moesin (ERM) proteins which are involved in linking the membrane and actin cortex and combined this with theoretical modelling of bleb dynamics. ResultsDedifferentiated chondrocytes at passage 1 (P 1) {{were found to be}} stiffer compared to freshly isolated chondrocytes (P 0), with equilibrium modulus values of 0. 40 and 0. 16  kPa respectively. The critical pressure increased from 0. 59  kPa at P 0 to 0. 74  kPa at P 1. Dedifferentiated cells at P 1 exhibited increased cortical F-actin organisation and increased expression of total and phosphorylated ERM proteins compared to cells at P 0. Theoretical modelling confirmed the importance of membrane-actin cortex adhesion in regulating bleb formation and effective cellular elastic modulus. ConclusionThis study demonstrates that chondrocyte dedifferentiation in monolayer strengthens membrane-actin cortex adhesion associated with increased F-actin organisation and up-regulation of ERM protein expression. Thus dedifferentiated cells have reduced susceptibility to bleb formation which increases cell modulus and may also regulate other fundamental aspects of cell function such as mechanotransduction and migration...|$|R

Hippocampal lesions increased the frequency of certain home cage behavior patterns (locomotion, rearing, sniffing and drinking), decreased the frequency of other patterns (sleeping/lying and shredding of nest materials) and left unchanged a third set of measures (alert inactivity, grooming and burrowing). In those cases where increments in occurrence of a given behavior were observed, there were lesion-induced shifts in frequency of initiation of certain behavior patterns (locomotion and sniffing) rather than in the duration of those patterns. This finding argues against a simple perservation view of the increment in frequency of these patterns. Lesion effects on reactivity to novel stimulation varied with the test procedure. Locomotor activity in an open field was enhanced, manipulatory and biting contacts with novel stimulus objects were reduced, and social reactions to unfamiliar visitor gerbils were relatively unaffected...|$|E

Methods: We used bimanual central cortical cleaning by elevating central fibers and aspirating them toward the periphery. Peripheral cortical fibers were removed passively only when they became loose due to copious irrigation. A one-piece foldable implant was inserted without a capsular tension ring. Postoperative corticosteroid drops were used. Results: This technique was safely performed in a dozen eyes with severe pseudo-exfoliation or brunescent cataract with weak zonules. Posterior capsular rupture, iritis, vitreous loss, and lens subluxation were not observed. Moderate capsular phimosis occurred but with maintained central vision. Conclusion: The dogma of “complete cortical cleanup” in severe zonulopathy needs to be revisited in favor of a clear visual axis with maximal preservation of the damaged zonules. This technique is ideal in patients above age 90 where posterior capsular opacification and late dislocation of intraocular lens–capsule bag complex are unlikely to occur until several years postoperatively.
