40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the influence of sense of coherence on the experiences of participants in a developmental <b>corporate</b> adventure <b>training</b> programme. The <b>corporate</b> adventure <b>training</b> programme was described from an experiential learning paradigm, while sense of coherence was described from a salutogenic paradigm. The study was undertaken with 37 members of the South African Police Service (SAPS) from different seniority and position in the SAPS. In order to determine the participants' sense of coherence and their experiences in the <b>corporate</b> adventure <b>training</b> programme, one quantitative measuring instrument and one qualitative measuring instrument were used. The quantitative instrument used to determine the participants' sense of coherence, was the orientation to life questionnaire (OLQ). Five participants with the highest scores and five participants with the lowest scores on the orientation to life questionnaire were identified. These 10 participants were subjected to an interview, determining their experiences during the <b>corporate</b> adventure <b>training</b> programme. The results of this study have shown that people with a higher score on the orientation to life questionnaire approached and experienced the programme differently to those with a lower score on the orientation to life questionnaire. Various hypotheses were formulated from the results of the study. These hypotheses were based on the participants' feedback, and included the fact that all participants experienced the <b>corporate</b> adventure <b>training</b> programme as an opportunity to relax away from work, therefore enhancing their psychological well-being. Relationships between the participants' experiences in the <b>corporate</b> adventure <b>training</b> programme and their scores achieved on the orientation to life questionnaire, was found. The environment influenced the experiences of the participants to a large extend, a finding that differed from findings suggested by previous research.
