40|$|The Foreste Casentinesi, Monte Falterona and Campigna National Park has an area {{of about}} 36, 000 ha and is located along the Apennine ridge, between the regions of Emilia Romagna and Tuscany. The forest area is about 79 %, while areas used for {{agriculture}} and grazing are about 7. 5 %. In the Park there are wild boar (Sus scrofa), fallow deer (Dama dama), red deer (Cervus elaphus), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus); the only predator is the wolf (Canis lupus). The most common deer is the red deer, an intermediate feeder being able to browse woody vegetation or graze grasslands. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the damage from red deer, based on the damaged surface and on the compensation that the Park annually paid during years 2006 - 2008. We used a GIS system that allowed us to obtain data on damaged areas subdivided by crop types (pasture, meadow pasture, arable, orchards and chestnut groves); it has also been possible to locate the orchards and <b>chestnut</b> <b>groves</b> for which compensation was paid. The nocturnal observation, the height of browsing and removed foliage permitted to discriminate between damage from different species. Pasture, meadow pasture and arable were damaged by red deer only in the first two years of our investigations (2006 : 3, 400 ha; 2007 : 26, 590 ha) and only in the Tuscan side of the Park, while in the Emilian side damages were caused by all the other ungulate. Orchards and <b>chestnuts</b> <b>groves,</b> instead, have been damaged in three years always in the same areas of Tuscan side. Total annual compensations paid for pasture, meadow pasture, arable, orchards and <b>chestnut</b> <b>groves</b> were very low, respectively € 2, 192 for 2006, € 694 for 2007 and € 350 for 2008. From this analysis, an enormous damage to the coppice together with the lack of compensation is also emerged; therefore the local Mountain Community requires a reduction of red deer population, creating a conflict with the purposes of the Park...|$|R

Now it had a peculiar significance. He turned abruptly from the trail he had been following and plunged down the steep hill. Crossing the creek he took to the cover of the willows, which grew profusely along the banks, and striking a sort of bridle path he started on a run. He ran easily, as though accustomed to that mode of travel, and his long strides covered a couple of miles in short order. Coming to the rugged bluff, which marked the end of the ridge, he stopped and walked slowly along the edge of the water. He struck the trail of the Indians where it crossed the creek, just where he expected. There were several moccasin tracks in the wet sand and, in some of the depressions made by the heels the rounded edges of the imprints were still smooth and intact. The little pools of muddy water, which still lay in these hollows, were other indications to his keen eyes that the Indians had passed this point early that morning.|$|E

It {{is an element}} on which I shall have to insist more in speaking of vegetation; but I must not pass it by, here, since, in fact, it constitutes one of the essential differences between hills of first-rate magnificence, and inferior ones. Not that there is want of quantity even in the lower ranges, {{but it is a}} quantity of inferior things, and therefore more easily represented or suggested. On a Highland hill side are multitudinous clusters of fern and heather; on an Alpine one, multitudinous groves of chestnut and pine. The number of the things may be the same, but the sense of infinity is in the latter case far greater, because the number is of nobler things. Indeed, so far as mere magnitude of space occupied on the field of the horizon is the measure of objects, a bank of earth ten feet high may, if we stoop to the foot of it, be made to occupy just as much of the sky as that bank of mountain at Villeneuve; nay, in many respects its little ravines and escarpments, watched with some help of imagination, may become very sufficiently representative to us of those of the great mountain; and in classing all water-worn mountain-ground under the general and humble term of Banks, I mean to imply this relationship of structure between the smallest eminences and the highest. But in this matter of superimposed quantity the distinctions of rank are at once fixed. The heap of earth bears its few tufts of moss or knots of grass; the Highland or Cumberland mountain its honeyed heathers or scented ferns; but the mass of the bank at Martigny or Villeneuve has a vineyard in every cranny of its rocks, and a <b>chestnut</b> <b>grove</b> on every crest of them.|$|E

The presence of the fungus Hypholoma fasciculare has been observed in chestnut orchard soils of Trás-os-Montes (Portugal). Although it is described as being a saprophyte, preliminary studies have demonstrated that H. fasciculare could cause serious damage to the {{chestnut tree}}s. On the other hand, it has an expressive antagonist action against other soil-borne fungi present in <b>chestnut</b> <b>groves.</b> In order to assess the consequences arising from the presence of this fungus on soil microbial diversity, the effect of the presence of H. fasciculare was evaluated. In this way, the fungal community of soils from three <b>chestnut</b> <b>groves</b> presenting different levels of H. fasciculare was compared. After DNA extraction from 10 soil cores from each soil, the ITS regions were amplified using the adequate primers for fungal sequences and 454 pyrosequencing was used for the assessment of soil metagenomes. Results will be presented taking into account the diversity of fungal trophic groups that could be important for chestnut sustainability, mainly the ectomycorrhizal fungi. These results will contribute to the identification of soil microbial species most affected by the presence of H. fasciculare, making it possible to assess the action of this fungus on beneficial mycorrhizal fungi to the chestnut tree.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of pasture in oak and <b>chestnut</b> <b>groves</b> on the chemical and sensorial traits of cured lard. Thirty Cinta Senese barrows (124 kg of l. w. on average) were allotted to three groups: one group (CONC) was reared outdoors in a confined area and fed commercial feedstuff. The other two groups were raised under free-range conditions on acorns (AC) or chestnuts (CH). At slaughtering (148 kg of LW) the backfat was seasoned for 60 days to obtained cured lard. Results demonstrated that the lard of CH and AC respect to CONC group was the richest in MUFA (46. 9 and 47. 76 vs 44. 78 % respectively) because of the higher content of oleic acid (44. 2 and 44. 91 vs 42. 05 %, P< 0. 05, respectively). CH showed a higher percentage of PUFA-n 3 than AC and CONC (1. 18 vs 1. 06 and 1. 03 %, P< 0. 05, respectively), a lower content of α-tocopherol (9. 77 vs 14. 46 and 13. 31 μ/g, P< 0. 05 respectively) and a higher content of γ-tocopherol (13. 73 vs 6. 02 and 4. 32 μ/g, P< 0. 05, respectively). As regards sensorial traits, the lard of CH and AC groups exhibited a lower value of pinkness than CONC (29. 3 and 32. 4 vs 49. 2, P< 0. 05, respectively) and higher scores of yellowness (31. 4 and 28. 6 vs 18. 6, P< 0. 05, respectively) and oiliness (37. 0 and 33. 7 vs 24. 0, P< 0. 05, respectively).

40|$|Final {{version of}} the chapter at: [URL] the 1970 s, natural {{resources}} the world over have been progressively re-evaluated {{in accordance with the}} principles of sustainable agriculture. The European chestnut, Castanea sativa Mill., a hardwood species belonging to the family Fagaceae, has not been unaffected by this process. It is an important resource {{in many parts of the}} world because of its economic and environmental role in many agroforestry systems, and in Europe it has been gaining in value as a source of timber and nut production and due to the contribution of <b>chestnut</b> <b>groves</b> to the landscape (Bounous, 2005). Like the American chestnut C. dentata, C. sativa has been plagued for more than a century by ink disease and chestnut blight, caused by the fungi Phytophthora cinnamomi and Cryphonectria parasitica, respectively. A great deal of research on chestnut focuses on the development of vegetative propagation systems capable of satisfying the demand for elite genotypes that provide both high-quality timber and/or nuts and resistance to these diseases. Since chestnut is a difficult-to-root species, grafting is the most frequent conventional propagation technique, although methods for layering and cutting have recently been improved and are widely used in nurseries to propagate ink-disease-resistant Euro-Japanese hybrids. However, as an alternative to conventional vegetative propagation methods, efforts are being made to establish reliable in vitro regeneration systems that allow clonal propagation. The two major systems are based on embryogenesis or on micropropagation of axillary shoots.
