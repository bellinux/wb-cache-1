500|$|The Act is {{relatively}} short, divided into 5 sections, the fifth covering {{the extent of}} the Act and its <b>commencement</b> <b>date.</b> Section 1 covers the test to determine if something is obscene; an article is taken to be obscene if the entire article [...] "is, if taken as a whole, such as to tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely, having regard to all relevant circumstances, to read, see or hear the matter contained or embodied in it". The test is based on [...] "persons"; DPP v Whyte [...] AC 849 established that it was not sufficient for an individual to be depraved or corrupted, it must be that a significant number of people likely to read it would become corrupt. [...] "article" [...] is defined within Section 1 as anything containing material that is read or looked at, any sound recordings and any film or other picture record. A publisher, as used in the Act, is also defined in Section 1; [...] "publisher" [...] is taken to mean anyone who [...] "distributes, circulates, sells, lets on hire, gives, or lends it, or who offers it for sale or for letting on hire", or [...] "in the case of an article containing or embodying matter to be looked at or a record, shows, plays or projects it".

An Act {{that does}} not include {{explicit}} <b>commencement</b> <b>dates</b> or provision for commencement orders, or that has dates or provides for commencement orders for only some of its contents, will typically be interpreted as having come into effect at a certain time relative to its enactment. This time is usually specified by an interpretive statute, or, in the absence of such a statute, a legal rule. For example, in the United Kingdom, until late in the 18th century a legal rule interpreted statutes as coming into effect {{at the start of the}} legislative session in which they were passed, but Acts of Parliament (Commencement) Act 1793 stipulated that future laws without explicit commencement provisions would come into effect on the day on which they received royal assent. A similar example is provided by New Zealand, where an Act without commencement provisions comes into force on the day after the day on which it received royal assent.|$|R
