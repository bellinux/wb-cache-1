2500|$|When the {{collector}} current {{rises above the}} data sheet limit [...] a new breakdown mechanism become important: the second breakdown. This phenomenon is caused by excessive heating of some points (hot spots) in the base-emitter region of the bipolar junction transistor, which give rise to an exponentially increasing current through these points: this exponential rise of current in turn gives rise to even more overheating, originating a positive thermal feedback mechanism. While analyzing the [...] static characteristic, {{the presence of this}} phenomenon is seen as a sharp <b>collector</b> <b>voltage</b> drop and a corresponding almost vertical rise of {{the collector}} current. At the present, {{it is not possible to}} produce a transistor without hot spots and thus without second breakdown, since their presence is related to the technology of refinement of silicon. During this process, very small but finite quantities of metals remain in localized portions of the wafer: these particles of metals became deep centers of recombination, i.e. centers where current exists in a preferred way. While this phenomenon is destructive for Bipolar junction transistors working in the usual way, it can be used to push-up further the current and voltage limits of a device working in avalanche mode by limiting its time duration: also, the switching speed of the device is not negatively affected. A clear description of avalanche transistor circuits working in second breakdown regime together with some examples can be found in the paper [...]|$|E

In this case, the common emitter voltage and Q1 <b>collector</b> <b>voltage</b> are not suitable for outputs. Only Q2 collector should {{be used as an}} output since, when the input voltage exceeds the high threshold and Q1 saturates, its base-emitter junction is forward biased and transfers the input voltage variations directly to the emitters.

This situation is typical for over-driven transistor differential amplifiers and ECL gates.|$|E

5000|$|Like every latch, the {{fundamental}} collector-base coupled bistable circuit possesses a hysteresis. So, {{it can be}} converted to a Schmitt trigger by connecting an additional base resistor R to one of the inputs (Q1 base in the figure). The two resistors R and R4 form a parallel voltage summer (the circle in the ballock diagram above) that sums output (Q2 <b>collector)</b> <b>voltage</b> and the input voltage, and drives the single-ended transistor [...] "comparator" [...] Q1. When the base voltage crosses the threshold (VBE0 âˆž 0.65 V) in some direction, a part of Q2's <b>collector</b> <b>voltage</b> is added in the same direction to the input voltage.

50|$|When {{the voltage}} of C1 {{right-hand}} plate (Q2 base voltage) becomes positive and reaches 0.6 V, Q2 base-emitter junction begins diverting {{a part of}} R2 charging current. Q2 begins conducting and this starts the avalanche-like positive feedback process as follows. Q2 <b>collector</b> <b>voltage</b> begins falling; this change transfers through the fully charged C2 to Q1 base and Q1 begins cutting off. Its <b>collector</b> <b>voltage</b> begins rising; this change transfers back through the almost empty C1 to Q2 base and makes Q2 conduct more thus sustaining the initial input impact on Q2 base. Thus the initial input change circulates along the feedback loop and grows in an avalanche-like manner until finally Q1 switches off and Q2 switches on. The forward-biased Q2 base-emitter junction fixes the voltage of C1 right-hand plate at 0.6 V and does not allow it to continue rising toward +V.|$|E

Typically, the <b>collector</b> <b>voltage</b> will be higher than the base voltage, and Schottky diode will be reverse biased. If the input current is increased, then the <b>collector</b> <b>voltage</b> falls below the base voltage, and the Shottky diode starts to conduct and shunt some of the base drive current into the collector. The transistor is designed so that its collector saturation voltage (...) {{is less than the}} base-emitter voltage [...] (roughly 0.6 V) minus the Shottky diode's forward voltage drop (roughly 0.2 V). Consequently, the excess input current is shunted away from the base and the transistor never goes into saturation.|$|E

Its <b>collector</b> <b>voltage</b> goes down and Q2 begins going cut-off, because the voltage divider now provides lower Q2 base voltage. The common emitter voltage follows this change and goes down thus making Q1 conduct more. The current begins steering {{from the right}} leg of the circuit to the left one. Although Q1 is more conducting, it passes less current through RE (since RC1 > RC2); the emitter voltage continues dropping and the effective Q1 base-emitter voltage continuously increases. This avalanche-like process continues until Q1 becomes completely turned on (saturated) and Q2 turned off.

50|$|Snapback is {{initiated}} {{by a small}} current from collector to base. In the case of ESD protection devices, this current is caused by avalanche breakdown due to a sufficiently large voltage applied across the collector-base junction. In the case of parasitic failures, the initiating current may result from inadvertently turning on the bipolar transistor and a sufficiently large voltage across the collector and base causing impact ionization, {{with some of the}} generated carriers then acting as the initiating current as they flow into the base. Once this initiating current flows into the base, the transistor turns on and the <b>collector</b> <b>voltage</b> decreases to the snapback holding voltage. This voltage happens {{at the point where the}} processes of base current generation and the bipolar transistor turning on are in balance: the collector-emitter current of the bipolar transistor decreases the <b>collector</b> <b>voltage,</b> which results in a lower electric field, which results in a smaller impact ionization or avalanche current and thus smaller base current, which weakens the bipolar action.|$|E

The high-resistive emitter element does not play any role it is shunted by the other low-resistive emitter follower. There is no negative feedback since the emitter voltage does not change at all when the input base voltages change. The common quiescent current vigorously steers between the two transistors and the output <b>collector</b> <b>voltages</b> vigorously change. The two transistors mutually ground their emitters; so, although they are common-collector stages, they actually act as common-emitter stages with maximum gain.
