The resulting standard became an American National Standard in 1988 and was last revised in 2006.

50|$|Air purifiers may {{be rated}} {{on a variety of}} factors, {{including}} <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Delivery</b> <b>Rate</b> (which determines how well air has been purified); efficient area coverage; air changes per hour; energy usage; and the cost of the replacement filters. Two other important factors to consider are the length that the filters are expected to last (measured in months or years) and the noise produced (measured in decibels) by the various settings that the purifier runs on. This information is available from most manufacturers.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} of this thesis developed experiments inside a sealed environmental chamber {{to examine the}} effectiveness of a botanical air filter with an assisting fan and a loose-packed growth media (i. e., Biowall) in removing toluene from air. Through injecting a known amount of toluene and continuously monitoring its decay inside the environmental chamber, five different toluene decay rates were quantified: the natural decay rate (empty chamber), the decay rates with the presence of the Biowall for two different fan speeds, and the decay rates with the presence of growth media without the plants for dry and wet conditions. The <b>clean</b> <b>air</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>rates</b> for the Biowall with both fan speeds and the growth media with both conditions were then found through the mass conservation of contaminates equation with respect to the natural decay rate and the chamber’s volume. Additionally, with the reference to ASHRAE 62. 2 standard for acceptable ventilation rates for residential buildings, weather data, and typical home sizes, the thesis estimated preliminary potential energy savings in ventilation for different climate zones based on the <b>clean</b> <b>air</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>rates</b> of the Biowall. ...|$|R
40|$|Portable {{photocatalytic}} {{air cleaners}} were investigated in 24 and 48 m 3 emission test chambers {{with regard to}} efficiency and by-product generation. For this purpose, formaldehyde, decane, 1, 2 -dichlorobenzene, toluene, α-pinene and heptanal were doped at sub-ppm concentration levels into the chambers individually and in mixtures. By way of specified test protocols, efficiencies could be distinguished but were strongly dependant on the choice of test compounds, especially on whether single or multi compound dosing was used, and on long-term effects. Initial <b>clean</b> <b>air</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>rates</b> (CADRs) up to 137 m 3 /h were measured. Typical by-products were found in significant concentrations. The main ones were formaldehyde up to 50 ppb (62 μg/m 3) and acetone up to 80 ppb (190 μg/m 3). Other aldehydes were also found, but at smaller levels. The detection of chloroacetone, a strong irritating compound, at concentrations up to 15 ppb (57 μg/m 3) strengthens the importance of such investigations especially in cases were chloro-organic compounds are involved...|$|R
40|$|American {{consumers}} {{have started to}} {{recognize the value of}} improved indoor air quality. Consequently, many Americans have purchased portable air cleaners, including devices that remove particles by generating ions. Portable ion generators are appealing because they are quiet and use considerably less energy than HEPA filters and other air cleaners. However, these devices often do not remove enough particles to be effective, do generate enough ozone (a byproduct of their operation) to be of concern, and can generate ozone reaction products including secondary organic aerosols. This paper summarizes our recent research as well as the work of others. We demonstrate that portable ion generators have low <b>clean</b> <b>air</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>rates</b> (CADRs) for 5 nm- 10 µm particles, generate levels of ozone in typical indoor environments that may lead to adverse health effects, and can act as particle generators. Results strongly suggest that ion generators do not have a role in sustainable indoor environments...|$|R
50|$|<b>Clean</b> <b>air</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>rate</b> is {{the amount}} of clean air an air cleaner {{provides}} to a room or space. When determining CADR, the amount of airflow in a space is taken into account. For example, an air cleaner with a flow rate of 100 cfm (cubic feet per minute) and an efficiency of 50% has a CADR of 50 cfm. Along with CADR, filtration performance is very important {{when it comes to the}} air in our indoor environment. Filter performance depends on the size of the particle or fiber, the filter packing density and depth and also the air flow rate.|$|E
5000|$|Consumer Reports, a {{non-profit}} US-based product-testing magazine, reported in October 2003 that air ionisers do not perform to high enough standards compared to conventional HEPA filters. The exception {{was a combination}} unit that used a fan to move air while ionizing it. In response to this report, The Sharper Image, a manufacturer of air ionisers (among other products), sued Consumer's Union (the publishers of Consumer Reports) for product defamation. Consumer Reports gave the Ionic Breeze and other popular units a [...] "fail" [...] {{because they have a}} low <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Delivery</b> <b>Rate</b> (CADR). CADR measures the amount of filtered air circulated during a short period of time, and was originally designed to rate media-based air cleaners. The Sharper Image claimed that this test was a poor way to rate the Ionic Breeze, since it {{does not take into account}} other features, such as 24-hour-a-day continuous cleaning, ease of maintenance, and silent operation.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Delivery</b> <b>Rate</b> (CADR) is {{a figure}} of merit that is the cubic feet per minute (CFM) of air that has had all the {{particles}} of a given size distribution removed. For air filters that have air flowing through them, it is the fraction of particles (of a particular size distribution) that {{have been removed from}} the air times the CFM air flow rate through the device. More precisely, it is the CFM of air in a [...] room that has had all the particles of a given size distribution removed from the air, over and above {{the rate at which the}} particles are naturally falling out of the air. Different filters have different abilities to remove different particle distributions, so three CADR's for a given device are typically measured: smoke, pollen, and dust. By combining the amount of airflow and particle removal efficiency, consumers are less likely to be misled by a high efficiency filter that is filtering a small amount of air, or by a high volume of air that is not being filtered very well.|$|E
40|$|Stand alone (portable) air {{cleaners}} {{may be an}} efficient means for rapid removal of indoor fine particles, with potential use for shelter-in-place strategies following acts of bio-terrorism. In this study, a screening model was developed to ascertain the potential significance of size-resolved particle removal using portable {{air cleaners}} relative to filtration in HVAC systems, deposition to indoor surfaces, and air exchange. The air exchange rate, volumetric flow rate through the HVAC system, and size-resolved particle removal efficiency in the HVAC filter were varied. The effectiveness of portable air cleaners depends on size specific <b>clean</b> <b>air</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>rates</b> CADR. Since these values were not readily available in the published literature, we used experiments to determine ranges of CADR based on three air cleaners {{that had been in}} use in residential homes. Experiments were completed in a well-mixed 11 -m 3 stainless-steel chamber. Incense sticks were burned for five minutes during each experiment, resulting in a poly-disperse aerosol {{with a wide range of}} fine particle diameters. Particle number concentrations were measured for seven ranges of particle diameter consistent with those expected for biological warfare agents.

40|$|An active botanical air {{filtration}} system, called the Biowall, {{is used to}} improve indoor air quality (IAQ) and provide the potential for energy savings for air conditioning in residential buildings. The Biowall {{is an integral part}} of the HVAC system to actively filter the return air from Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). Â Â The Biowall was recently evaluated in an environmental chamber with controlled conditions to measure its air cleaning characteristics. Â Â A â€˜pull-downâ€™ test method, in which a known amount of contaminant was introduced to the chamber so that its decay could be monitored over time, was used for the evaluation. Â The decay rate of the contaminants with the Biowall present was then compared to the decay rate of an empty chamber and the growth media alone (without plants). The experiments also evaluated the filter at different airflow rates across the filter and different moisture content inside the growth media. Based on the experimental data, the <b>clean</b> <b>air</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>rates</b> (CADR) of the Biowall were quantified. The preliminary results showed that the Biowall removed up to 90 % of the introduced contaminants within two to three hours inside a sealed environmental chamber. This could potentially translate into energy savings on the ventilation systems up to 25 %. In addition to savings on ventilation, the Biowall could contribute in saving heating and cooling energy by reducing the air temperature during summer months, and reducing the air dryness during the winter months. Â Beyond these quantifiable benefits, a Biowall provides an intangible benefit by adding a pleasant natural aesthetic to a home...|$|R

To evaluate efficient strategies {{for control of}} printer pollution, the present paper examines the cleaning performance and economical benefit of a combination between portable electrostatic air cleaners (AC) and ventilation. The study is based on both field experiments and experiments in a test chamber. A particle number balance model was also built up. It shows that, with the same sum of ventilation air flow rate (Qv) and AC <b>clean</b> <b>air</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>rate</b> (CADR), if no outdoor pollution influence, the cleaning performance is constant. The measurements indicate that although the particle exposure (e. g. average concentration) may be strongly reduced by adding an air cleaner with sufficient CADR, the maximum (peak) concentration is not reduced to the same extent.

40|$|This study {{demonstrated}} that a laboratory-scale recirculation closed-loop reactor {{can be an}} efficient technique for {{the determination of the}} <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Delivery</b> <b>Rate</b> (CADR) of PhotoCatalytic Oxidation (PCO) air purification devices. The recirculation closed-loop reactor was modeled by associating equations related to two ideal reactors: one is a perfectly mixed reservoir and the other is a plug flow system corresponding to the PCO device itself. Based {{on the assumption that the}} ratio between the residence time in the PCO device and the residence time in the reservoir τP/τR tends to 0, the model highlights that a lab closed-loop reactor can be a suitable technique for the determination of the efficiency of PCO devices. Moreover, if the single-pass removal efficiency is lower than 5 % of the treated flow rate, the decrease in the pollutant concentration over time can be characterized by a first-order decay model in which the time constant is proportional to the CADR. The limits of the model are examined and reported in terms of operating conditions (experiment duration, ratio of residence times, and flow rate ranges) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} how the effectiveness of portable air cleaners (ACs) against tobacco smoke is influenced by the <b>clean</b> <b>air</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>rate</b> (CADR), the location of the AC in relation to the pollution source and the apartment structure. The study was based on field experiments and simulations with the CONTAM software. The AC effectiveness was about 80 % for one AC, and 93 % for two ACs in the studied apartment (volume= 110 m 3). Ultrafine particles (UFP) exposure in a room without tobacco smoking (clean room) could be much less than in the source room if these rooms were not directly connected with each other (but indirectly connected via doors open to other rooms). Operating the AC in one of the rooms without cigarette smoking could develop a partly isolated clean environment. However, this led to a rather low cleaning effectiveness for the concentration of ultrafine particles in the apartment as a whole. If operating the AC in the room where cigarettes are being smoked, the UFP exposure in the whole apartment can be further reduced...|$|E
40|$|Various commercially {{available}} natural ventilation devices supply fresh air without mechanical assistance. These devices offer a low-energy alternative to mechanical air handling units. However, they often cannot satisfy recommended ventilation rates {{due to their}} dependence on both macro- and microclimate wind speeds. This work examines the feasibility of achieving the recommended fresh <b>air</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>rates</b> without impacting on the device energy requirements. A numerical investigation is carried out using a standard passive stack device geometry combined with a simulated low-powered axial fan. The investigation shows that a low-induced pressure of 20 Pa is enough to satisfy the legislative requirements. Depending on the macroclimate conditions, this induced pressure could be generated from a {{commercially available}} solar-powered system. As the fan system is only used in periods of low external wind velocities (1 m/s), it is termed a passive-assisted stack...|$|R

Numerical analysis is carried out using a commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code, to investigate the effect of various external wind velocities (1 – 5 m/s) and directions (concurrent and counter current) on the device performance. The results show that the windvent is capable of providing recommended rates of fresh air supply even at relatively low incident wind velocities.

40|$|A {{conservative}} assessment {{suggests that}} over 1 % of {{homes in the}} U. S. use ionizing air cleaners. Ion generators use charged plates to remove oppositely-charged particles and often generate ozone as a byproduct of their operation. In the present paper, five commercially available ionizing air cleaners were evaluated and compared to a portable HEPA filter and dedicated ozone generator. Air flow rate, ozone emission rate, and size resolved (0. 1 - 1 µm) <b>clean</b> <b>air</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>rate</b> (CADR) were measured in a stainless steel test chamber for each cleaner. The air flow rates ranged from less than 30 m 3 /hr to 75 m 3 /hr, about {{an order of magnitude}} lower than a portable HEPA filter. Ozone emission rates were 0. 7 – 4. 1 mg/hr, about an order of magnitude lower than a dedicated ozone generator. Although the ozone emission rates for ion generators were low, they still may represent a health concern. The ionizing air cleaners remove submicron particles with CADRs ranging from 8 - 82 (m 3 /hr), considerably lower than the 200 – 250 m 3 /hr range for the tested HEPA air filter. These results allow for a more complete analysis of the positive and negative indoor air quality impacts of portable ion generators...|$|E

After inter-lab comparisons validating the method and analytical procedures, the commercial devices were evaluated for the mineralization of a mixture of four representative VOCs (acetaldehyde, acetone, n-heptane and toluene). Comparison of the degradation rate allowed the determination of the <b>clean</b> <b>air</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>rate</b> (CADR), while the mineralization efficiency was determined from CO 2 /inf analysis. The devices could be ranked in two classes: class 1 for efficient devices (high CADR, extended mineralization, no by-product) and class 2 for inefficient and unsafe ones (by-product release {{even in the absence of}} VOCs, low CADR and mineralization). Electrical low pressure impactor (ELPI) could not evidence any nanoparticles release with any of the studied devices. Formaldehyde was the main by-product detected in all cases, but the concentration remained low and decreased with time due to its total mineralization with class 1 devices. For class 2 devices, formaldehyde concentration was higher and went on increasing with time. These experimental data point out the urgent need of careful evaluation and certification of commercial photocatalytic air-purifiers for consumer's safety and secure development of the technology. © 2015 Elsevier B.

40|$|In the Final Master‘s Project the {{efficiency}} of indoor air quality measures for indoor air improvement have been investigated. Residential indoor air quality is of increasing concern, because indoor air can be polluted more than outdoors. So the removal of such contaminants is no longer sufficient only by natural pollutant removal measures. Experimental tests of three air cleaners and ventilation were carried out in 36. 3 m 3 room chamber simulating real conditions of living room. Cigarette burning test was carried out to generate aerosol particle. Aerosol particle concentrations were measured and these air cleaning devices‘ indicators were calculated: particle decay rate (K, 1 /h), efficiency (E,%), <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Delivery</b> <b>Rate</b> (CADR, m 3 /h). Efficiencies of air cleaners were tested in the chamber without air circulation. Aerosol particle concentration raised to 1. 06 × 106 cm- 3. When air cleaners operated, particulate matter concentrations decreased from 92, 8 to 99. 9 percent. To assess the influence of ventilation on particle removal a few tests with regulated air circulation were carried out. Efficiencies of air cleaners were tested with 3 different air exchange rates: 0. 1, 0. 6, 1. 0 h- 1. After an hour the efficiencies were from 93 to 99. 9 %. A device with a HEPA raised efficiency > 90 % in 20 minutes. So particles can be effectively eliminated by using air cleaner for a shoter time (20 to 40 min), depending on the cleaner‘s technology.

Method: To achieve this objective, {{it was necessary to}} design standardized test benches and protocols to assess photocatalytic efficiency of materials or systems used in the treatment of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and odour under conditions close to applications. The tests are based on the validation of robust analytical methods at the parts per billion by volume level that not only follow the disappearance of the initial VOCs but also identify the secondary species and calculate the mineralization rates. Results: The first results of inter-laboratory closed chamber tests, according to XP B 44 - 013 AFNOR standard, are described. The photocatalytic degradation of mixtures of several defined pollutants under controlled conditions (temperature, relative humidity, initial concentration) was carried out in two independent laboratories with the same photocatalytic device and with various analytical procedures. Comparison of the degradation rate and of the mineralization efficiency allowed the determination of the <b>clean</b> <b>air</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>rate</b> in both cases. Formaldehyde was the only by-product detected during photocatalytic test under standardized experimental conditions. The concentration of transient formaldehyde varied according to the initial VOC concentration. Moreover the photocatalytic reaction rate of formaldehyde in mixture with other pollutants was analysed. It was concluded that formaldehyde concentration did not increase with time.

40|$|Nowadays, {{with the}} {{increased}} concern of Indoor Air Quality, portable air cleaner is commonly utilized to treat air in indoor environments.

The revised <b>Clean</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Delivery</b> <b>Rate</b> (CADR) of each air cleaner was evaluated by performing a simplified indoor particulate analysis. The performance of the electronic air cleaner was more dependent on the surface area of the testing venue and higher CADR was obtained in residences than in the control room which could be as large as 6. 9 times in maximum for small particles. The removal efficiency of the air cleaners was also dependent on their flow characteristics and the degree of mixing of air delivered from the air cleaner.
