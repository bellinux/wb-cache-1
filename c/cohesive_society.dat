One or more individuals can rise above all others by displaying ‘social supremacy’.

Even within socially <b>cohesive</b> <b>societies,</b> structure, hierarchy and cooperation are required to ensure effective functioning of the group.

40|$|Ethno-religious {{community}} organizations in Western countries {{have often been}} described as being disconnected from mainstream society, and Muslim community groups have been a special focus of such critique. This article offers a counter-narrative to these widespread allegations.

The article examines the potential of Muslim {{community organizations}} to mobilize their member into performing their citizenship through civic and political participation. It offers empirical evidence that many Muslim community organizations, rather than promoting social segregation, act as accessible entry point for Muslims’ civic participation, facilitate cross-community engagement and provide gateways to political involvement.

Here, we review recent advances made in this area of research in several insect groups: the ants, bees, wasps, and termites. Drawing from whole-genome comparisons, candidate gene approaches, and a genome-scale comparative analysis of protein-coding sequence, we highlight novel insights gained for five major biological processes: chemical signaling, brain development and function, immunity, reproduction, and metabolism and nutrition. Lastly, we make comparisons across these diverse approaches and social insect lineages and discuss potential common themes of eusocial evolution, as well as challenges and prospects for future research in the field...|$|R

40|$|Recently, various {{attempts}} have been undertaken to develop a single comprehensive social cohesion indicator and to monitor progress toward achieving <b>cohesive</b> <b>societies</b> and communities. However, according to sociological theory, contemporary modern communitites should function according to {{a different type of}} social cohesion than traditional communities used to do. Both from a theoretical as from a methodological perspective, it can be questioned whether there is indeed one single concept of social cohesion. In this article, we develop indicators for the 308 local communities in Flanders, Belgium. We use an extensive dataset, including elements such as social exclusion, poverty, crime, religious involvement and associational life. A series of factor analyses demonstrates that all these indicators can be reduced to two distinct dimensions of social cohesion.

The purpose of this research is to identify if indicators of social cohesion can be used to map trends at the city level in order to draw meaningful conclusions, particularly {{in the aftermath of a}} natural disaster. Using known indicators of social cohesion and Christchurch City as the basis for this study, variations in social cohesion have been found within the city wards, that preceded but were affected by the events of the Canterbury earthquakes during 2010 / 11.

40|$|The {{influence}} of classical- and neo-liberal imperatives {{in relation to}} immigration {{is not confined to}} the settlement processes of new immigrants. It seems to penetrate the whole procedure, including the formation of immigration policy, the selection of immigrants, their settlement, their residential and economic activities, and social experiences. Furthermore, it extends, on a national level, to the nation-building project of New Zealand for a <b>cohesive</b> multi-ethnic civil <b>society.</b> Current tensions and conflicts surrounding immigration in Western countries appear to be the immediate products of the collision between, on the one hand, ethnic immigrants who experience socio-economic discrimination in their search for social and economic spaces for them in the host society and, on the other, the existing inhabitants of the host society who might experience anxiety over the changed social space around them. The ultimate cause of these tensions and conflicts, however, seems to be the collision between, on the one hand, global and local capitalist imperatives to incorporate nationstates into the global capitalist system and, on the other, the social imperatives of nationstates to maintain a <b>cohesive</b> national <b>society.</b> In order to achieve the <b>cohesive</b> multi-ethnic national <b>society,</b> a countermovement may be required which, in Polanyi’s term, facilitates the de-commodification of both labour and ethnicity, against the grain of classical- and neoliberal imperatives...|$|R

40|$|The {{notion of}} a European social model assumes that European {{societies}} have certain features in common which distinguish them positively from the United States, among them most notably the social partnership in labour relations, redistributive welfare state schemes, and <b>cohesive</b> <b>societies</b> with a low degree of social inequality.

Special attention is drawn to the influence of supranational decision-making in the European Union and {{to the role of the}} European Court of Justice. It is shown that Court rulings imperil the viability of national social programs, because they open the schemes to transnational access even though they continue to be nationally financed. This is also in tension with the solidarity concepts of European citizens which continue to be framed in terms of national citizenship. As a possible solution to these tensions, the strengthening of the participation rights of national parliaments and governments on the European level is advocated. Zusammenfassun...|$|R
