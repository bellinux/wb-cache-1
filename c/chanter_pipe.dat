5000|$|The tsampouna (or tsambouna; τσαμπούνα) is a Greek folk {{instrument}} of the bagpipe family. It is a double-chantered bagpipe, with no drone, and is inflated by blowing by mouth into a goatskin bag. The instrument is widespread in the Greek islands. The word is a reborrowing of zampogna, the word for the Italian double <b>chantered</b> <b>pipes.</b> Tsampouna is etymologically related to the Greek sumfōnia (συμφωνία), meaning [...] "concord or unison of sound" [...] (from σῠν- sun-, [...] "with, together" [...] + φωνή phōnḗ, [...] "sound") and applied later to a type of bagpipe.|$|R
5000|$|Zampogna ( [...] or [...] ) is {{a generic}} {{term for a}} number of Italian double <b>chantered</b> <b>pipes</b> that can be found as far north as the {{southern}} part of the Marche, throughout areas in Abruzzo, Latium, Molise, Basilicata, Campania, Calabria, and Sicily. The tradition is now mostly associated with Christmas, and the most famous Italian carol, [...] "Tu scendi dalle stelle" [...] (You Come Down From the Stars) is derived from traditional zampogna music. However, there is an ongoing resurgence of the instrument in secular use seen with the increasing number of folk music festivals and folk music ensembles.|$|R

2500|$|Other {{variations}} of the duda, especially those played along the Slovakian and Croatian borders, {{have as many as}} four <b>chanter</b> <b>pipes.</b> In these examples one hand plays the dominant through the octave on one pipe while the other hand plays the tonic through the subdominant on another (in this case the tonic through the subdominant have no chromatic possibilities except through half-holing since the flea hole is on a separate pipe). If a fourth pipe is added it is a stopped pipe with a thumb hole that sounds the octave when uncovered. (These pipes show the influence of Croatian and Slovakian pipes, both of which commonly have up to four separate chanter bores.) ...|$|R

50|$|Another {{variant of}} the chanter is the two-piped chanter (often called a double <b>chanter).</b> The <b>chanter</b> <b>pipes</b> may be {{designed}} to be played separately, one with each hand, or the two chanters may be played in unison (as in most Arabic bagpipes). One chanter may provide a drone accompaniment to the other, or the two chanters may play in a harmony of thirds and sixths (as in the southern Italian zampogna). In pipes of the Carpathian basin up to five separate chanter bores may be placed in parallel within a single chanter assembly, providing both melodic and rhythmic possibilities: in the simplest case, one pipe is used to play the melody while the second provides a variable drone, while more complex pipes may separate certain individual notes into separate, stopped pipes.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} bagpipe tunes from Northumberland, {{or indeed}} {{from anywhere in}} the British Isles, are found in William Dixon's manuscript from the 1730s. Some of these can be played on Border pipes or an open-ended smallpipe like the modern Scottish smallpipes, but about half the tunes have a single octave range and sound well on the single-octave, simple, keyless Northumbrian <b>pipe</b> <b>chanter.</b> These tunes are almost all extended variation sets on dance tunes in various rhythms - reels, jigs, compound triple-time tunes (now known as slip jigs), and triple-time hornpipes.|$|R
50|$|Simple closed chanter smallpipes {{had existed}} {{since the late}} 17th century (possibly being {{described}} in the Talbot manuscript from about 1695) but became standard in Northumberland during the 18th. Keys were not added until around 1800 -John Peacock's tune book (c1800) includes A compleat drawing of J. Peacock's New Invented <b>Pipe</b> <b>Chanter</b> {{with the addition of}} four keys. As John Dunn was closely associated with Peacock at this time, Dunn may well have been the first to construct such an instrument, but sets of Reid pipes from this time onwards started including keys, and more keys were added to the design over the following years.|$|R
50|$|The gaida of Bulgaria {{is worthy}} of its own subsection. In Bulgaria the gaida {{has been a long}} symbol of the country and its heritage, {{and is one of the}} more {{well-known}} instruments of the country. The gaida most widely used is the Thracian gaida. There is in the Rhodope mountains the deep-sounding kaba gaida. In the north, common of Dubrudzha and the Vlachs there is the dzhura gaida. Also in the Stranzha region near the border with Turkey there is the Stranzha gaida. The bag itself is made of a goat skin turned inside out, and most often the rims of the different parts of the instrument - <b>chanter</b> and drone <b>pipe</b> - have a piece of horn on it.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pipe</b> <b>Chanters</b> and {{practice}} chanters are typically {{made out of}} a hard wood such as African Blackwood; before {{the expansion of the}} British Empire, native woods were used, and are still used in many folk instruments. In the 1960s African Blackwood was in very short supply, and Ireland's only bagpipe maker, Andrew Warnock of The Pipers Cave in Northern Ireland, began making chanters from polyoxymethylene (also known by several names), an extremely strong and durable machinable plastic which at the time was used for making police batons. The Gibson and Dunbar chanters are made out of polyoxymethylene. It is a material that can be machined and polished much like soft metals. Since there is no danger of splitting with a plastic chanter, {{there is no need for}} a sole (see below), although some models retain it for decorative purposes.|$|R
50|$|Dunn was a {{maker of}} Northumbrian smallpipes and is {{regarded}} as the first to have added keys to the chanter, (c. 1800 AD), extending the range of the instrument from an octave to a twelfth. He may thus be regarded as the inventor of the modern instrument. The earliest evidence of such a keyed chanter is the illustration and fingering chart in John Peacock's tunebook, A Favorite Collection of Tunes with Variations Adapted for the Northumberland Small Pipes, Violin, or Flute, first published by William Wright, of Newcastle, in about 1800. This depicts a simple keyless chanter with an octave range from G to g, as well as J. Peacock's New Invented <b>Pipe</b> <b>Chanter</b> with the addition of Four Keys, these keys were for the notes low D, E, F sharp, and high a. Subsequent makers, particularly Robert Reid, added more keys to extend the range further, and include chromatic notes.|$|R
50|$|Some of the Peacock {{variation}} sets such as Cuckold {{come out}} of the Amrey, based on the Scottish tune Struan Robertson's Rant, are not known from any earlier source. The collection also contains adaptations of other music, particularly some Scottish fiddle music, to smallpipes. Some of these pieces, like My Ain Kind Dearie, need the keyed chanter with its extended range; this tune in particular is notable for the detailed notation of the variation and the ornaments. This may give some idea what Bewick meant by 'his lilts, his pauses and his variations'. Some tunes in the collection, such as The Black and the Grey, are adaptations to a single-octave <b>chanter</b> of Border <b>Pipe</b> tunes with a nine note range; necessarily something of the original was lost, and this adaptation in particular is less successful, however some others, such as Over the Border, work very well in Peacock's version.|$|R
5000|$|The Pastoral chanter {{is used to}} {{play the}} melody and is similar to later flat set union <b>pipe</b> <b>chanters</b> in tone. It has eight finger holes giving middle C, D, E♭, E, F♯, G, A, B, C♯, D' using open {{fingering}} in the first register. Most of the accidentals {{can be obtained by}} cross-fingering and a second register is available by increasing the bag pressure. [...] With a suitable reed, a few third-octave notes can also be played. Later sets included fully chromatic chanters using as many as seven keys. The chanter uses a complex double-bladed reed, {{similar to that of the}} oboe or bassoon. This must be crafted so that it can play two full octaves accurately, without the fine tuning allowed by the use of a player's lips; only bag pressure and fingering can be used to maintain the correct pitch of each note.|$|R
5000|$|The Pastoral pipe had {{a narrow}} throat bore of 3.5 - 4 mm and an exit bore seldom larger than 11mm. Its bore {{was very similar}} to later flat set Union <b>pipe</b> <b>chanter</b> bores made in the early 18th century. The reeds had a head width of 9.5mm to 10.5mm and staple bores of 3.6mm. The chanters were made {{in a variety of}} pitches with a quiet tone and an E flat pitch being very common among {{surviving}} instruments. [...] Later examples include a slide on the foot joint to change the lower leading note from flat to sharp as required and on a further set an on/off mechanism is fitted to control the drones with the two regulators fitted neatly {{to the top of the}} common stock and the addition of key in [...] "e" [...] to increase the compass of the chanter in the second octave.|$|R
2500|$|The MacCrimmons and the MacArthurs {{were said}} to have been the finest pipers and exponents of the piobaireachd and history relates great rivalry between the {{families}} for supremacy. Both the MacCrimmons and the MacArthurs had colleges for piping students; the former on the farm of Boreraig, eight miles [...] south west of Dunvegan Castle on Skye, the latter at Ulva near Mull. For the MacCrimmon pupils seven years study was necessary in their apprenticeship. The pupils had a solitary designated area of open space in which to practice the scales and tunes on the <b>chanter,</b> the Small <b>Pipes</b> and Piob Mhòr before being allowed to perform for their Master Tutor. The college at Ulva had four rooms; one for cattle, one for guests to stay, one for practice and one specifically for the use of students. In both cases the countryside was preferred for practice as was, and still is, deemed correct for the Piob Mhòr.|$|R
2500|$|According {{to their}} own records, on 12 November 1988, the Lincolnshire Heritage Trust (now renamed Heritage Trust of Lincolnshire) {{commissioned}} pipemaker John Addison of South Somercotes to undertake research into historic bagpipes in Lincolnshire {{and to create a}} set of Lincolnshire pipes based on that research. [...] John Addison was a maker of Northumbrian smallpipes, Irish pipes, Musettes de Cour, Border and Lowland pipes and Northumbrian Half Longs. [...] Addison was well aware of the high degree of conjecture that anyone recreating a bagpipe, of the type once seen in Lincolnshire, would have to employ. [...] In 1984, John Addison wrote about the carving in Branston Church: [...] "This powerful but primitive motif gives at least some information; it shows a bagpipe with one <b>chanter</b> (melody <b>pipe)</b> which is probably conical, one drone with a bell end, and it is mouth blown". [...] Addison goes on to say [...] "This description also covers pipes which would undoubtedly have been seen in a large part of Eastern Europe, most of Western Europe and some of North Africa and can be still seen in some of these places today". [...] Addison reached the conclusion, from his research on the possible existence of a regional bagpipe for Lincolnshire, that the closest relative of such a pipe was the Spanish gaita gallega, which he believed to be the most straightforward form of the bagpipe existing in Europe. [...] Addison based his new pipes on three carvings: a pew end carving in All Saints' Church, Branston; an oak ceiling boss in the cloister of Lincoln Cathedral and a stone carving taken from Moorby Church before it was demolished in November 1982. [...] All three depictions appear to have a conical chanter and a single bass drone. [...] The pipes made by Addison strongly physically resemble the Spanish gaita.|$|R
5000|$|A half set is {{the next}} stage up from a {{practice}} set. As with other forms of bagpipes, uilleann pipes use [...] "drones", which are most commonly three pipes accompanying the melody of the chanter with a constant background tonic note. The pipes are generally equipped with three drones: the tenor drone, as the highest sounding pipe, which is pitched {{the same as the}} lowest note of the chanter; the baritone drone pitched one octave below that; and the bass drone, as the lowest sounding pipe, two octaves below the bottom note of the <b>chanter.</b> The Pastoral <b>pipes</b> had four drones: these three plus one more that would play a harmony note at the fourth or fifth interval. These drones are connected to the pipe bag by a [...] "stock". This is an intricately made wooden cylinder tied into the bag (as any other stock) by a thick yarn or hemp thread. The drones connect to the stock, as do the regulators (see full set below). The stock and drones are laid across the right thigh. This is distinct from other forms of bagpipes, in which the drones are usually carried over the shoulder or over the right arm.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, the late Bazzell Ray Cowan of Austin, Texas, an {{electronics}} engineer and piper, developed the first practical electronic bagpipe with an authentic pipe sound, {{which he called}} the Bazpipe. According to Mr. Cowan (in an interview in 1993), the project had originally been {{in response to a}} bet with another piper at a wedding. The original version consisted of a <b>chanter</b> (the melody <b>pipe)</b> utilizing gold-plated metal contacts, which in turn were connected to a motherboard, transistors and a speaker, powered by a 6 volt lantern battery, all housed in an extruded plastic [...] "bag" [...] {{the size and shape of}} a regular bagpipe bag. Eventually, with the advance of technology, he was able to downsize it, till by the early 1990s, it consisted of a chanter topped with a 6 x 4 inch plastic box which housed all the components, including a 2 inch speaker, all powered by a 9 volt battery. By his death in 1996, it had become one of the best-known devices of the genre. Many of the later electronic pipes would be modeled on the Bazpipe.|$|R
5000|$|The early bladder pipe is in {{a family}} of the early medieval [...] "chorus" [...] instruments, a word which in medieval Latin was {{frequently}} used also for the bagpipe. In the earliest illustrated forms of bladder pipe, such as the well-known example of the 13th century reproduced by Martin Gerbert from a manuscript at Sankt Blasien Abbey in the Black Forest, the bladder is unusually large, and the <b>chanter</b> (or melody <b>pipe)</b> has, instead of a bell, the carved head of an animal. At first the chanter was a straight conical tube terminating in a bell, as in the bagpipe. The later instruments have a pipe of larger calibre more or less curved and bent back as in the letter [...] "J" [...] as the crumhorn, tournebout, and cromorne. This curvature, coming from the shape of an animal horn, suggests the early crumhorn's development from a bladder pipe. One famous illustration of these bladder pipes appears in the 13th-century Spanish manuscript, known as the Cantigas de Santa Maria in the library of El Escorial in Madrid, together with a bladder pipe having two <b>pipes,</b> a <b>chanter</b> and a drone side by side. Another Platerspiel is illustrated by Sebastian Virdung (1511).|$|R
50|$|He is also closely {{associated}} with the first printed collection of music for smallpipes, A Favorite Collection of Tunes with Variations Adapted for the Northumberland Small Pipes, Violin, or Flute, published by William Wright, of Newcastle, probably in 1801. The book had an engraved title page in the style of Thomas Bewick, and probably from his workshop, and the 1801 date is suggested by entries in the account books of Thomas Bewick for work done for Wright, between February and June 1801; in any case, Wright gave the address of his shop as High Bridge, so the date of publication definitely preceded the move of the business from High Bridge to Pilgrim Street, which he announced in April and May 1803.As well as containing 50 tunes for smallpipes, the book also contains an engraving, also thought to have been done in Bewick's workshop, showing 2 chanters and their fingering charts; one is a simple keyless chanter with an octave range from G to g, the other is J. Peacock's New Invented <b>Pipe</b> <b>Chanter</b> with the addition of Four Keys, these keys were for the notes low D, E, F sharp, and high a. Peacock was thus probably the first player of the instrument to play an extended keyed chanter. Such chanters continued to be developed in {{the first decades of the}} 19th century, by John Dunn, in association with Peacock, and slightly later by Robert Reid, and subsequently by others, including Reid's son James.|$|R
