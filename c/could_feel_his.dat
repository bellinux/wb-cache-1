500|$|Harper {{described}} {{the extent to}} which Duvall inhabited his character: [...] "Someone once said to me, 'Well, how's Robert Duvall?' and I said, 'I don't know Robert Duvall. I know Mac Sledge very well. Beresford, too, said the transformation was so believable that he <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> skin crawling up {{the back of his neck}} the first day of filming. Duvall made an effort to help Harper, who was making her film debut. While preparing to shoot a scene in which Mac and Rosa Lee fight, he yelled at a make-up artist in front of Harper to make her angry and fuel her performance; he apologized to the make-up artist after the scene was shot.|$|E
500|$|Although it {{was decided}} he has a sister, {{a wife and a}} daughter, Meyer's {{personal}} life is rarely mentioned on screen, enabling viewers to perceive him as a strong man onto whom they can [...] "project whatever they want from their own imagination." [...] Irving believes that modern television drama is populated by characters prone to disclosing everything about themselves, and so feels that having an enigmatic character like Meyer, who behaves in the reserved vein of Humphrey Bogart and Spencer Tracy, makes for a [...] "refreshing change". He commented that revealing more of Meyer's personal life would be anticlimatic compared to viewers' expectations. As preparation for the role, Irving observed coronary artery bypass surgery performed at Papworth and Middlesex Hospital, deeming the experience an [...] "enormous privilege". He had a [...] "real fascination" [...] with medicine and the human body prior to assuming the role, and considered studying biology at university. Upon receiving the script for the first episode of Holby City, Irving felt immediately connected to Meyer, commenting: [...] "I knew instinctively how he moved, how he spoke, what he felt. I <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> heartbeat." ...|$|E
2500|$|Actress Tess Harper, who co-starred, said Duvall {{inhabited}} the character so fully that she only {{got to know}} Mac Sledge and not Duvall himself. Director Bruce Beresford, too, said the transformation was so believable {{to him that he}} <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> skin crawling up {{the back of his neck}} the first day of filming with Duvall. Beresford said of the actor, [...] "Duvall has the ability to completely inhabit the person he's acting. He totally and utterly becomes that person to a degree which is uncanny." [...] Nevertheless, Duvall and Beresford did not get along well during the production and often clashed during filming, including one day in which Beresford walked off the set in frustration.|$|E
50|$|In issue #47, He {{mentioned}} to Fugitoid and Harold he {{is connected to}} his body's vital signs. Indicating he <b>could</b> still <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> body and was slowly getting back to normal.|$|R
5000|$|In a shoot interview, Road Warrior Animal {{was asked}} {{who was the}} toughest wrestler he had ever come across and he said [...] "Haku without a doubt ! You <b>could</b> just <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> strength".|$|R
60|$|She {{could see}} him brace himself. She <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> him brace <b>his</b> very body ere he answered.|$|R
2500|$|As Barks blossomed creatively, his {{marriage}} to Clara deteriorated. This is the period referred to in Barks' famed quip that he <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> creative juices flowing while the whiskey bottles hurled at him by a tipsy Clara flew by his head. They were divorced in 1951, his second and last divorce. In this period Barks dabbled in fine art, exhibiting paintings at local art shows. It was {{at one of these}} in 1952 he became acquainted with fellow exhibitor Margaret Wynnfred Williams (1917 – March 10, 1993), nicknamed Garé. She was an accomplished landscape artist, some of whose paintings are {{in the collection of the}} Leanin' Tree Museum of Western Art. During her lifetime, and to this day, note cards of her paintings are available from Leanin' Tree. Her nickname appears as a store name in the story [...] "Christmas in Duckburg", featured on page 1 of Walt Disney’s Christmas Parade #9, published in 1958. Soon after they met, she started assisting Barks, handling the solid blacks and lettering, both of which he had found onerous. They married in 1954 and the union lasted until her death.|$|E
60|$|The little flame died out. She <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> body trembling.|$|E
60|$|His {{answer came}} in a swift, {{throbbing}} question, his lips so near her face that she <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> breath hot upon her cheek.|$|E
60|$|Amyas started back, {{and held}} Frank by the {{shoulders}} at arm's length; as he did so, he <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> through, that <b>his</b> brother's arms were but skin and bone.|$|R
6000|$|... 'A very {{uncommon}} headache,' thought Louis. 'My belief is, that it {{is little}} short of brain fever! If I <b>could</b> only <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> pulse! But {{it would be very}} like taking a mad dog's hand. There's nothing for it but to fetch old Walby. He may have some experience of refractory patients.' ...|$|R
60|$|Then I rose, {{and going}} to the open window, drew up the blind and stood there staring at the sky, which grew pearl-hued with the first faint tinge of dawn. Leo came also and leant upon the window-sill, and I <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>his</b> body was {{trembling}} as though with cold. Clearly he was much moved.|$|R
60|$|Very cheerful! He was {{a horrible}} nuisance. And all at once he started to argue. I <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> crazy {{excitement}} in the dark.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Too near!' said Hugh, stooping {{over her}} so that she <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> breath upon her forehead. 'Why too near? You're always proud to ME, mistress.' ...|$|E
60|$|Gyp <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> wicked old smile {{even before}} she raised herself. But {{what did it matter}} if he did guess? She knew he would keep a stable secret.|$|E
5|$|A classic {{victory was}} within his grasp but he <b>could</b> almost <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> adversary's breath on his neck. Somehow Garin {{held on to}} his lead of two metres, two little metres for a legendary victory. The stands {{exploded}} and the ovation united the two men. Garin exulted under the cheers of the crowd. Cordang cried bitter tears of disappointment.|$|R
5000|$|She {{described}} Jungle Jim: [...] "All that showmanship was {{his true}} personality. He just didn't turn that {{on at the}} track and then became normal like everyone else at home. He had that sort of flair {{even when we were}} just at the house or went out some place. You <b>could</b> always <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> presence wherever he was." ...|$|R
60|$|The girl summoned her {{self-control}} with an effort, for {{she felt}} she must play the part she had decided on; but she felt her heart beat as she moved a little {{so that she could}} look up at her companion. He had moved, too, and though his face showed but vaguely, she <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>his</b> eyes were fixed upon her.|$|R
60|$|He sat {{looking at}} her. She <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> darkened steady eyes {{looking at her}} all the time. It made her a little bit frightened. She pushed her hair off her {{forehead}} nervously.|$|E
60|$|Steele {{stood at}} our backs, and I <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> presence. He thrilled me. He {{had some kind}} of effect on the others, {{especially}} the dealer, who was honest enough while the Ranger looked on.|$|E
60|$|He kissed her, but {{she knew}} he could not touch her. His arms were round her, but they had not got her. She <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> mouth upon her, {{but she was not}} at all {{compelled}} by it.|$|E
6000|$|He {{was going}} to reach [...] "Many Waters" [...] in time to warn Anderson, and that fact gave him strange exultation. When it was assured {{and he had the}} eighty {{thousand}} dollars deposited in a bank he <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>his</b> gray, gloomy future would have several happy memories. How would Lenore Anderson feel toward a man who had saved her father? The thought was too rich, too sweet for Kurt to dwell upon.|$|R
60|$|The play went on. But he {{was obsessed}} {{by the desire}} to kiss the tiny blue vein that nestled in the bend of her arm. He <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> it. <b>His</b> whole face seemed {{suspended}} till he had put his lips there. It must be done. And the other people! At last he bent quickly forward and touched it with his lips. His moustache brushed the sensitive flesh. Clara shivered, drew away her arm.|$|R
60|$|Kennicott was triumphant {{when the}} Commercial Club did capture one small shy factory which planned to make wooden automobile-wheels, but when Carol saw the {{promoter}} she <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> that <b>his</b> coming much mattered--and a year after, when he failed, {{she could not}} be very sorrowful.|$|R
60|$|Tars Tarkas {{listened in}} silence, but I <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> eyes riveted upon me and I {{knew that he}} awaited my answer as one might listen to the reading of his {{sentence}} by the foreman of a jury.|$|E
60|$|Her warm breath playing, flying rhythmically {{over his}} ear, seemed to relax the tension. She <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> body {{gradually}} relaxing a little, losing its terrifying, unnatural rigidity. Her hands clutched his limbs, his muscles, going over him spasmodically.|$|E
60|$|He had dodged behind me, and {{appeared}} to be looking anxiously down the road. I <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> aged frame shaking with terror as he laid his thin hands upon my shoulders and faced me {{in the direction of the}} supposed danger.|$|E
50|$|As a young man, Lannoy had a {{military}} career, {{fighting against the}} Prince-Bishopric of Liège (1430), England (1436), Lorraine (1440) and the Electorate of Cologne (1447). In later life {{he wrote to his}} son that when called upon to speak in sessions of the council he <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> self-conscious about <b>his</b> lack of education.|$|R
5000|$|In the Japanese anime and BL game, DRAMAtical Murder, a {{supporting}} character named Noiz suffers from this disorder. When he was younger, his parents considered him a disgrace {{because he would}} play rough with other children because he didn't understand what pain felt like. The only pain he <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> was from <b>his</b> tongue.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Rout {{had gone}} away, and Captain MacWhirr <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> against <b>his</b> ear the {{pulsation}} of the engines, like {{the beat of}} the ship's heart. Mr. Rout's voice down there shouted something distantly. The ship pitched headlong, the pulsation leaped with a hissing tumult, and stopped dead. Captain MacWhirr's face was impassive, and his eyes were fixed aimlessly on the crouching shape of the second mate. Again Mr. Rout's voice cried out in the depths, and the pulsating beats recommenced, with slow strokes--growing swifter.|$|R
60|$|Then Coulthurst, {{apparently}} by {{a supreme}} effort, raised himself a trifle, {{and he was}} a foot or two nearer the fir when he lay prone again. Ingleby fancied he <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> sinews cracking, and knew they would not endure that tension long.|$|E
60|$|This {{last was}} said in a note of anxious sneering that made Gerald's veins tingle with fine hate for her. He leaned far out of the boat, {{reaching}} down into the water. He <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> position was ridiculous, his loins exposed behind him.|$|E
60|$|He came {{so close}} that their clothes touched. 'Will you try to love me? Do try to love me!' he said, in a whisper, taking her hand. He had never taken it before. She <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> hand {{trembling}} exceedingly as it held hers in its clasp.|$|E
60|$|The leper halted in {{the front}} porch {{for a moment and}} we jumped out on him with the sticks. He was wonderfully strong, and we were afraid that he might escape or be fatally injured before we caught him. We had an idea that lepers were frail creatures, but this proved to be incorrect. Strickland knocked his legs from under him and I put my foot on his neck. He mewed hideously, and even through my riding-boots I <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>his</b> flesh was not the flesh of a clean man.|$|R
50|$|Emperor Ming was {{commonly}} {{regarded as}} an intelligent and frugal ruler, {{and he took a}} hands-on approach to governance. He was, however, also known for his suspecting nature, and few high-level officials <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> safe during <b>his</b> reign. He also periodically continued to kill the descendants of (presumably to Emperors Gao and Wu) and cry bitterly, before carrying out the actions.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{questions}} that remain unanswered regarding Kulothunga’s role in Athirajendra’s death. Who {{was responsible for the}} troubles in Kanchipuram soon after Athirajendra’s ascension, that made Vikramaditya’s involvement necessary? Who were the ‘wicked people’ of Kanchipuram and Gangaikonda Cholapuram whom Vikramaditya had to suppress before Athirajendra <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> secure in <b>his</b> throne? What was the nature of the rebellion a few days after Athirajendra’s return from the Chola country? ...|$|R
