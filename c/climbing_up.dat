5|$|Agonistic {{behaviour}} typically {{consists of}} squabbles between individuals climbing over or passing each other. This occasionally involves biting. Males that are strangers may wrestle, chase, and bite each other. In extreme situations, a male {{may try to}} displace a smaller rival from a tree. This involves the larger aggressor <b>climbing</b> <b>up</b> and attempting to corner the victim, which tries either to rush past him and climb down or {{to move to the}} end of a branch. The aggressor attacks by grasping the target by the shoulders and repeatedly biting him. Once the weaker individual is driven away, the victor bellows and marks the tree. Pregnant and lactating females are particularly aggressive and attack individuals that come too close. In general, however, koalas tend to avoid energy-wasting aggressive behaviour.|$|E
5|$|From the Sea of Marmara, {{the wall}} turns sharply to the northeast, {{until it reaches}} the Golden Gate, at about 14m above sea level. From there and until the Gate of Rhegion the wall follows {{a more or less}} {{straight}} line to the north, climbing the city's Seventh Hill. From there the wall turns sharply to the northeast, <b>climbing</b> <b>up</b> to the Gate of St. Romanus, located near the peak of the Seventh Hill at some 68m above sea level. From there the wall descends into the valley of the river Lycus, where it reaches its lowest point at 35m above sea level. Climbing the slope of the Sixth Hill, the wall then rises up to the Gate of Charisius or Gate of Adrianople, at some 76m height. From the Gate of Adrianople to the Blachernae, the walls fall to a level of some 60 m. From there the later walls of Blachernae project sharply to the west, reaching the coastal plain at the Golden Horn near the so-called Prisons of Anemas.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{visit the}} murderer's house, where Mulder sees a {{repairman}} {{working on the}} cable line. They find hundreds of video tapes of the news. Scully believes all the violence the man watched on TV may have {{led him to the}} murders, something Mulder does not believe. That night Scully watches the tapes, seeing if there are any clues to why the man committed murder. She steps outside for a break and sees Mulder in a car talking to the Cigarette Smoking Man. In the morning Scully suspiciously asks Mulder if he moved the car in the night. When Mulder tells her he only went out for a paper earlier, she believes he is lying. The next day a similar murder occurs when a woman thinks she sees her husband in a hammock with another woman; in reality she has killed her neighbor who was in a hammock with his dog. Mulder sees the same cable repairman near the house, who escapes from him. <b>Climbing</b> <b>up</b> on the telephone pole Mulder finds a device inside the cable box.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Colombian film director Simon Brand, in Los Angeles between April 6 and April 8, 2001, and was choreographed by Dan Karaty. Shot in a set with futuristic backdrops, Simpson assumes {{the role of a}} spy on a mission in the video. It begins with Simpson exiting a helicopter then entering a building to compromise evidence in a laboratory there. Simpson takes the elevator which opens onto a pathway. While she is walking, a gadget appears on the floor followed by a small explosion. In the next scene, Simpson walks through a water tunnel, out of which she is pulled by a robotic hand. As the video progresses, Simpson is shown dancing {{in a room full of}} mirrors. Scenes of ninjas <b>climbing</b> <b>up</b> a rope hanging from top of the building are inter-cut with scenes of Simpson dancing until the laboratory explodes. Simpson is next shown dancing on the rooftop alongside the ninjas before a helicopter arrives and Simpson boards it.|$|E
