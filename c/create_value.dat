25|$|Business process {{management}} (BPM) is a disciplined approach to identify, design, execute, document, measure, monitor, and control both automated and non-automated business processes to achieve consistent, targeted results aligned with an organization’s strategic goals. BPM involves the deliberate, collaborative and increasingly technology-aided definition, improvement, innovation, {{and management of}} end-to-end business processes that drive business results, <b>create</b> <b>value,</b> and enable an organization to meet its business objectives with more agility. BPM enables an enterprise to align its business processes to its business strategy, leading to effective overall company performance through improvements of specific work activities either within a specific department, across the enterprise, or between organizations.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the social}} constructivist approach, {{instructors}} have {{to adapt to the}} role of facilitators and not teachers (Bauersfeld, 1995). Whereas a teacher gives a didactic lecture that covers the subject matter, a facilitator helps the learner to get to his or her own understanding of the content. In the former scenario the learner plays a passive role and in the latter scenario the learner plays {{an active role in the}} learning process. The emphasis thus turns away from the instructor and the content, and towards the learner (Gamoran, Secada, & Marrett, 1998). This dramatic change of role implies that a facilitator needs to display a totally different set of skills than that of a teacher (Brownstein 2001). A teacher tells, a facilitator asks; a teacher lectures from the front, a facilitator supports from the back; a teacher gives answers according to a set curriculum, a facilitator provides guidelines and creates the environment for the learner to arrive at his or her own conclusions; a teacher mostly gives a monologue, a facilitator is in continuous dialogue with the learners (Rhodes and Bellamy, 1999). A facilitator should also be able to adapt the learning experience 'in mid-air' by taking the initiative to steer the learning experience to where the learners want to <b>create</b> <b>value.</b>|$|E
25|$|Israel's {{thriving}} {{venture capital}} industry has {{played an important}} role in funding the country's booming high-technology sector. The country is now teeming with hundreds of prosperous Israeli private equity and venture firms looking to invest in the next potential million or billion dollar business startup. Many of Israel's venture capital firms have billions of dollars under management that are seeking to invest in domestic Israeli companies in order to <b>create</b> <b>value</b> by marking a strong presence across the country. The financial crisis of 2007–08 also affected the availability of venture capital locally. In 2009, there were 63 mergers and acquisitions in the Israeli market worth a total of $2.54 billion; 7% below 2008 levels ($2.74 billion), when 82 Israeli companies were merged or acquired, and 33% lower than 2007 proceeds ($3.79 billion) when 87 Israeli companies were merged or acquired. Numerous Israeli high tech companies have been acquired by global corporations for its reliable corporate management and quality personnel. In addition to venture capital funds, many of the world's leading investment banks, pension funds, and insurance companies have a strong presence in Israel committing their funds to financially back Israeli high-tech firms and benefit from its prosperous high tech sector. These institutional investors include Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, Credit Swiss First Boston, Merrill Lynch, CalPERS, Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, and AIG.|$|E

To {{help us understand}} this concept better, we will use {{the example of a}} listed company, General Electric, between 1991 and 1999. To obtain the <b>created</b> shareholder <b>value,</b> we must first define the increase of equity market value, the shareholder value added, the shareholder return, and the required return to equity. A company <b>creates</b> <b>value</b> for its shareholders when the shareholder return exceeds the required return to equity. In other words, a company <b>creates</b> <b>value</b> in one year when it outperforms expectations. The <b>created</b> shareholder <b>value</b> is quantified as follows: Created shareholder value = Equity market value x (Shareholder return - Ke). The <b>created</b> shareholder <b>value</b> can also be calculated as follows: Created shareholder value = Shareholder value added - (Equity market value x Ke).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master’s thesis {{is to examine the}} process of <b>creating</b> <b>values</b> in a {{purchasing}} organisation; meaning in which areas <b>created</b> <b>values</b> can be added and what affects the possibility to do so. In addition, the study looks into what can be improved to further enlarge the business spectrum.

This gives several aspects of within which areas you can work with added values. The study is based on a questionnaire to 60 purchasers at Scania CV AB. The thesis demonstrates that to a certain extent sourcing managers already work with increasing the business spectrum by adding values. But even though Scania is a company with a mature purchasing organisation there are still several areas where the work with <b>created</b> <b>values</b> can be improved, for example within process development and administration...|$|R

2500|$|This area {{is related}} to {{corporate}} finance in two ways. Firstly, firm exposure to business and market risk {{is a direct result}} of previous capital financial investments. Secondly, both disciplines share the goal of enhancing, or preserving, firm value. [...] There is a fundamental debate [...] relating to [...] "Risk Management" [...] and shareholder value. Per the Modigliani and Miller framework, hedging is irrelevant since diversified shareholders are assumed to not care about firm-specific risks, whereas, on the other hand hedging is seen to <b>create</b> <b>value</b> in that it reduces the probability of financial distress. A further question, is the shareholder's desire to optimize risk versus taking exposure to pure risk (a risk event that only has a negative side, such as loss of life or limb). The debate links the value of risk management in a market to the cost of bankruptcy in that market.|$|E
2500|$|Discussions over value {{are common}} in studies on organ gifting. As Lock has indicated, {{the main reason for}} this is that [...] "human body parts do not have {{universal}} value, and once, potentially available for conversion into circulating commodities, their worth, and more basically the question of whether or not they are alienable, is open to dispute". An important factor to consider is the fact that organ gifting differs from the gifting of blood or semen in the sense that organs are scarce. It is this scarcity which creates stronger relationships between the giver and the receiver because it endows the object that is being transferred with greater value. As Appadurai (1986) has indicated, the link between exchange and value is created by politics, thus making value an issue of judgment. In the case of organ exchange, when the demand, whether real or fictitious, exceeds the supply, the object is endowed with greater value. In other words, objects can be controlled to <b>create</b> <b>value.</b> Several authors have examined the issue of organ scarcity pointing to the different ways in which it is publicly exacerbated for profit-driven interests.|$|E
