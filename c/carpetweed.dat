50|$|Mollugo is a genus in the {{flowering}} plant family Molluginaceae. It comprises {{a few dozen}} species of herbaceous plants, including Mollugo verticillata, <b>carpetweed</b> or green <b>carpetweed.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Carpetweed</b> is {{considered}} to be globally secure. It is also credited as an invasive weed by USDA.gov. IUCN RedList states that the taxon has not been assessed for the IUCN Red List. Other accounts cite the weed as being native to the Continental US, Caribbean territories, Mexico and introduced to Canada. It can be found in disturbed habitats such as fields, parking lots and gardens.|$|E
50|$|The {{wide range}} of M. verticillata is {{apparent}} across North America, Brazil, Columbia, Mexico, West Indies, Central America, South America, Eurasia and Africa. There is agreement among some studies that the <b>carpetweed</b> origin is from the New World tropics and it spread into more temperate zones afterwards. Overall the place of origin {{has been attributed to}} the tropics or subtropics of the northern and southern hemispheres. Commonly found in warm to wet environments across North America.|$|E
50|$|Mollugo cerviana is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant known by the common name threadstem <b>carpetweed.</b> It {{can be found on}} most continents growing as a weed in many types of dry, sandy habitat types. It is an annual herb producing a thin, erect stem up to about 20 centimeters tall. The narrow, waxy leaves are up to 1.5 centimeters long, linear in shape, and arranged in whorls around the stem. The inflorescence is a loose umbel of tiny flowers each made up of whitish, petal-like sepals less than 2 millimeters long, and no true petals.|$|E
5000|$|Ajuga reptans is {{commonly}} known as bugle, blue bugle, bugleherb, bugleweed, <b>carpetweed,</b> carpet bugleweed, and common bugle, and traditionally but less commonly as [...] "St. Lawrence plant". It is an herbaceous flowering plant native to Europe. It is invasive in parts of North America. Grown as a garden plant it provides useful groundcover. Numerous cultivars have been selected, of which [...] "Caitlin's Giant" [...] has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Ajuga reptans is also a component of purple moor grass and rush pastures, a Biodiversity Action Plan habitat in the United Kingdom.|$|E
50|$|Kallstroemia parviflora, {{also called}} small-flowered <b>carpetweed</b> or warty caltrop, {{is found in}} the United States, and extends as far south as Central America. From east to west, it can be found from Illinois to Arizona. It is an orange or yellow small-flowered annual, with zygomorphic flowers {{consistent}} with the Zygophyllaceae, or creosote-bush family, to which it belongs. Leaves are compound and are 3-6 cm, with 4 pairs leaflets. The stem is pubescent and 30-60 cm. Flowers measure at 1 cm, while the ovoid fruit measures at 4 mm. The plant prefers dry soils and can be found in locations such as near roads and railroads.|$|E
5000|$|Carbon dating has dated {{seeds of}} M. verticillata found in Icehouse Bottom Tennessee back to 1170- 140 B.C. Other seeds found in Troyville, Louisiana were dated back to 500 A.D. It is unsure exactly when or how M. verticillata spread into {{temperate}} North America. European movements {{were not the}} cause of this migration because carbon dating reveals that the plant was in the Little Tennessee river valley 3000 years ago. Despite littleapparent food value, native aborigines may have had uses of M. verticillata that are unclear today. <b>Carpetweed,</b> also referred to as [...] "Indian chickweed", was utilized as a potherb by the Southern Appalachian aborigines.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carpetweed</b> has narrow, whorled leaves, 3-8 at each node. At {{maturity}} {{the plant}} may lose its characteristic basal rosette formation. Leaves are approximately 1-3 cm {{in length and}} possess an obovate shape. Leaf apex may vary from rounded to acute. The plant will grow and sprawl across the soil due to its habit of prostrate growth and form mats. The flowers are usually in clusters of 2-5, blooming from July through September. Flowers are white or greenish white with tiny 5-15 mm stalks. Flowers quickly turn into fruit that is egg shaped and 1.5-4 mm in length. The dehiscent capsule opens at maturity. The seeds are 0.5 mm long and are red to rusty brown in coloration.|$|E
5000|$|Mollugo verticillata, {{the green}} <b>carpetweed,</b> is a rapidly {{spreading}} annual plant from tropical America. In eastern North America, it {{is a common}} weed growing in disturbed areas. It forms a prostrate circular mat that can quickly climb over nearby plants and obstacles. The species has been reported from every state in the United States except Alaska, Hawaii, and Utah, as well as from British Columbia, Manitoba. Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. [...] Although considered an invasive weed, M. verticillata is also known to be edible. Archaeological evidence has shown that M. verticillata has been in North America around 3000 years. Sometimes also referred to as [...] "Indian chickweed", and in China is referred to as zhong leng su mi cao.|$|E

40|$|Robert H. Mohlenbrock {{provides}} a definitive {{account of the}} pokeweed, four-o 2 ̆ 7 clock, <b>carpetweed,</b> cactus, purslane, goosefoot, pigweed, and pink families in Illinois. Flowering Plants: Pokeweeds, Four-o’clocks, Carpetweeds, Cacti, Purslanes, Goosefoots, Pigweeds, and Pinks is the fifteenth volume of the Illustrated Flora of Illinois series and the ninth devoted to dicots, or plants that have two seed-leaves, or cotyledons, upon germination. Each of the 141 plants is beautifully illustrated by Paul W. Nelson. Nelson shows the full habitat of the plant and close-ups of various vegetative and reproductive structures that are crucial for the identification of individual species. Each illustration includes detailed drawings of the flowers, fruits, and seeds of the plant covered. Mohlenbrock {{provides a}} complete description of each species {{as well as a}} discussion of the nomenclature and habitats, and his fifty-three years of experience enable him to present little-known diagnostic features for many species. Range maps show the county distribution of each species in Illinois. Mohlenbrock includes a statement giving the overall range of each species in the United States as well as a detailed key for the identification of the species. Flowering Plants contains many plants whose obscure flower parts make them exceedingly difficult to identify. The close-up illustrations of these parts will aid the user of the book immensely in identification of the species. Included are several species previously unknown in Illinois. New illustrations, which include detailed drawings of the flowers, fruits, and seeds are presented for each species covered in this book. Mohlenbrock’s fifty-three years of experience enable him to present little-known diagnostic features for many species. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Seed banks, {{the reserve}} of viable seeds dormant in the soil, {{function}} in several {{important roles in}} the population and community dynamics of plant communities. Identification of the seed bank can furnish information on the vegetation history of a habitat, predict the future composition of the plant community, and provide insight on the seed viability and biology of plant species. Although seed banks of prairie ecosystems have been well studied, very little information exists on seed banks of reconstructed prairie. Identification of seed bank populations of reconstructed prairie provides a means to evaluate the success of restorations and establishes baseline data to monitor the development of prairie over time. A seed bank study of reconstructed prairie in central Iowa was conducted from March 2000 to July 2002. Samples of the seed bank in the top 3 cm of soil were collected at 15 sites on the reconstruction {{at the beginning of}} its fifth growing season. A seedling assay was used to identify and count seeds. A total of 2, 693 seedlings and 62 plant taxa were observed in the seed bank. Out of the 78 plant species seeded at the study sites, 15 species were observed in the seed bank. Three of these were non-native species seeded by mistake. Among the other 47 species observed, about half were native and half were exotic. The most abundant species in the seed bank included green <b>carpetweed</b> (Mollugo vertieillaw), common yellow oxalis (Oxalis striew), witchgrass (Panicum capillare), hairy white oldfield aster (Symphyotrichum pilosum), and amaranth (Amaranthus rudis). Total seed densities ranged from 293 seeds/m 2 / 3 cm to 12, 247 seeds/m 2 / 3 cm. An ordination of the seed bank samples with the vegetation in 1999 and 2000 clearly shows a high dissimilarity between vegetation and seed bank as well as much greater variation in the seed bank composition than in the vegetation...|$|E
40|$|The lack of {{effective}} broadleaf weed control {{represents one of}} the major factors having detrimental effects on growth and yield of soybeans. Broadleaf weeds are a serious threat to soybean growers in the southeastern United States. A broad range of herbicides is being used in an effort to control broadleaf weeds in soybeans, and research is still being conducted to find new herbicides that can best work for this purpose. This study involved the use of one these herbicides. It was fomesafen, 5 -[2 -chloro- 4 -trifluromethyl) phenoxy]-N-(methyl-sulfonyl) - 2 -nitrobenzamide, which controls a broad spectrum of broadleaf weeds in soybeans. The experiment was conducted in the summers of 1987 and 1988. Broadleaf weed control treatments with fomesafen at rates at 0. 07, 0. 14, 0. 28, and 0. 35 kg ai/ha in single early postemergence and late postemergence applications were evaluated using the herbicide with a nonionic surfactant at 0. 25 % and 0. 50 % of the solution. All treatments were compared with a check which did not receive herbicide application. Among the most common broadleaf weeds found in the area under study during the summer of 1987 were morningglories (Ipomoea spp), redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), jimsonweed (Datura stramonium L.), common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.), <b>carpetweed</b> (Moliugo verticillata L.), and prickly sida (Sida spinose L.), For the summer of 1988 the most prevalent broadleaf weeds were morningglories, horsenettle (Solanum carolinense L.), horseweed [Conyza canadensis (L.), Cronq. ], and prickly sida. The results of the experiment showed no significant differences between early postemergence and late postemergence treatments. There {{were no significant differences in}} broadleaf weed control in treatments which received 0. 14, 0. 28 and 0. 35 kg ai/ha of fomesafen for either 1987 or 1988. Poor broadleaf weed control resulted with the application of fomesafen at its lowest rate (0. 07 kg ai/ha). No significant differences were found in broadleaf weed control between concentration of 0. 25 % and 0. 50 % of the nonionic surfactant added to fomesafen. Statistically significant yield variation did occur among treatments in 1987. No significant differences in yields were found between any of the herbicide treatments in 1988. Soybean yields were significantly higher in 1988 than in 1987...|$|E
