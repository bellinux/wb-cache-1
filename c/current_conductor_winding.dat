40|$|DE 102007005232 A 1 UPAB: 20080820 NOVELTY - The {{fuel cell}} {{assembly}} has a membrane unit (2) with an electrode, {{which is in}} the form of an anode (3) or a cathode (4). A <b>current</b> <b>conductor</b> structure has an electrically conductive <b>current</b> <b>conductor</b> base body (6). The <b>current</b> <b>conductor</b> base body has a passivation layer (7) with individual contacts (8) distributed over the surface. The individual contacts are arranged in such a way that they make electrical contact with an electrode on one side and with the <b>current</b> <b>conductor</b> base body on the other. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for the manufacturing of a fuel cell assembly. USE - Fuel cell assembly, particularly micro fuel cell, foil fuel cell or portable fuel cell for electronic devices, articles of clothes and vehicle. ADVANTAGE - The fuel cell assembly has a membrane unit with an electrode, {{which is in the}} form of an anode or a cathode and a <b>current</b> <b>conductor</b> structure has an electrically conductive <b>current</b> <b>conductor</b> base body, and hence ensures to provide high corrosion stability and low contact resistance to a membrane unit and thus enables cost effective production of the fuel cell assembly...|$|R
