50|$|<b>Cataxia</b> eungellaensis is {{a species}} of idiopid spiders, found in Queensland, Australia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cataxia</b> is {{a spider}} genus {{in the family}} Idiopidae found in Australia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cataxia</b> eungellaensis prefers wet, dense rainforests {{where it}} makes its burrow on slopes where moss and ferns grow.|$|E
50|$|Eurhythma <b>cataxia</b> is a moth in the Crambidae family. It was {{described}} by Turner in 1913. It is found in Australia, {{where it has been}} recorded from the Northern Territory.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cataxia</b> eungellaensis is {{only known}} from the female. It is dark brown in general colouration, the legs being dark with yellow-red naked streaks. Abdomen is {{moderately}} hairy, with a brown pattern of bands fused into a background of pale yellow. The cephalothorax is glabrous and is 10.2mm long and 8.2mm wide. The eye group is compact, with the front row slightly procurved. The sternum lacks spinules, and the labium has nine cuspules, eight {{of which are in}} an irregular row, with one anterior to them. There is one large tarsal claw sometimes with one small one beneath it.|$|E
40|$|Published online 20 September 2017 The Australasian spiny {{trapdoor}} spiders of {{the family}} Idiopidae (subfamily Arbanitinae) are revised at the generic level, using a multi-locus molecular phylogenetic foundation and comprehensive sampling of all known lineages. We propose a new family- and genus-group classification for the monophyletic Australasian fauna, and recognise 10 genera in four tribes. The Arbanitini Simon includes Arbanitis L. Koch, 1874 (61 species), Blakistonia Hogg, 1902 (one species) and Cantuaria Hogg, 1902 (43 species). The Aganippini Simon includes Bungulla Rix, Main, Raven & Harvey, gen. nov. (two species), Eucanippe Rix, Main, Raven & Harvey, gen. nov. (one species), Eucyrtops Pocock, 1897 (two species), Gaius Rainbow, 1914 (one species) and Idiosoma Ausserer, 1871 (14 species). The Cataxiini Rainbow and Euoplini Rainbow include just <b>Cataxia</b> Rainbow, 1914 (11 species) and Euoplos Rainbow, 1914 (12 species), respectively. Two distinctive new genera of Aganippini are described from Western Australia, and several previously valid genera are recognised as junior synonyms of existing genus-group names, including Misgolas Karsch, 1878 (= Arbanitis; new synonymy), Aganippe O. P. -Cambridge, 1877 (= Idiosoma; new synonymy) and Anidiops Pocock, 1897 (= Idiosoma; new synonymy). Gaius stat. rev. is further removed from synonymy of Anidiops. Other previously hypothesised generic synonyms are supported by both morphology and molecular phylogenetic data from 12 genes, including the synonymy of Neohomogona Main, 1985 and Homogona Rainbow, 1914 with <b>Cataxia,</b> and the synonymy of Albaniana Rainbow & Pulleine, 1918, Armadalia Rainbow & Pulleine, 1918, Bancroftiana Rainbow & Pulleine, 1918 and Tambouriniana Rainbow & Pulleine, 1918 with Euoplos. At the species level, the identifications of Eucy. latior (O. P. -Cambridge, 1877) and I. manstridgei (Pocock, 1897) are clarified, and three new species are described: Bungulla bertmaini Rix, Main, Raven & Harvey, sp. nov., Eucanippe bifida Rix, Main, Raven & Harvey, sp. nov. and Idiosoma galeosomoides Rix, Main, Raven & Harvey, sp. nov., the latter remarkable for its phragmotic abdominal morphology. The Tasmanian species Mygale annulipes C. L. Koch, 1842 is here transferred to the genus Stanwellia Rainbow & Pulleine, 1918 (family Nemesiidae), comb. nov., Arbanitis mestoni Hickman, 1928 is transferred to Cantuaria, comb. nov. and Idiosoma hirsutum Main, 1952 is synonymised with I. sigillatum (O. P. -Cambridge, 1870), new synonymy. In addition to the morphological synopses and an illustrated key to genera, molecular diagnoses are presented for all nominal taxa, along with live habitus and burrow images to assist in field identification. The Australasian idiopid fauna is highly diverse, with numerous new species known from all genera. As a result, this study provides a taxonomic and nomenclatural foundation for future species-level analyses, and a single reference point for the monographic documentation of a remarkable fauna.
