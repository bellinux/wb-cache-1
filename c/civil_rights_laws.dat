5|$|Bars and {{restaurants}} are considered strictly liable for their patrons' behavior, and liquor licenses can be suspended or revoked if a customer engages in illegal activity (e.g. fighting, public urination) after drinking. New Jersey law recognizes both dram shop liability and social host liability, wherein the server of alcohol to visibly intoxicated persons or minors is liable {{if that person}} then causes death or injury to a third party in an alcohol-related automobile collision or other accident. In order to mitigate liability, the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) grants licensed establishments the right to exclude any patron for any reason, but warns business against violating <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>laws.</b>|$|E
5|$|Grant was {{vigorous}} in his {{enforcement of}} the 14th and 15th amendments and prosecuted thousands of persons who violated African American civil rights; he used military force to put down political insurrections in Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina. He proactively used military and Justice Department enforcement of <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>laws</b> {{and the protection of}} African Americans more than any other 19th century president. He used his full powers to weaken the Ku Klux Klan, reducing violence and intimidation in the South. He appointed James Milton Turner as the first African American minister to a foreign nation. Grant's relationship with Charles Sumner, the leader in promoting civil rights, was shattered by the Senator's opposition to Grant's plan to acquire Santo Domingo by treaty. Grant retaliated, firing men Sumner had recommended and having allies strip Sumner of his chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee. Sumner joined the Liberal Republican movement in 1872 to fight Grant's reelection.|$|E
5|$|Hayes {{appointed}} two Associate Justices to the Supreme Court. The first vacancy {{occurred when}} David Davis resigned {{to enter the}} Senate during the election controversy of 1876. On taking office, Hayes appointed John Marshall Harlan to the seat. A former candidate for governor of Kentucky, Harlan had been Benjamin Bristow's campaign manager at the 1876 Republican convention, and Hayes had earlier considered him for Attorney General. Hayes submitted the nomination in October 1877, but it aroused some dissent in the Senate because of Harlan's limited experience in public office. Harlan was nonetheless confirmed and served on the court for thirty-four years, in which he voted (usually in the minority) for an aggressive enforcement of the <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>laws.</b> In 1880, a second seat became vacant upon the resignation of Justice William Strong. Hayes nominated William Burnham Woods, a carpetbagger Republican circuit court judge from Alabama. Woods served six years on the Court, ultimately proving a disappointment to Hayes as he interpreted the Constitution in a manner more {{similar to that of}} Southern Democrats than to Hayes's own preferences.|$|E
40|$|<b>Civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> {{is today}} moribund. An {{impressive}} edifice, built upon {{the ruins of}} Jim Crow, with the blood and sweat of the <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> movement, and intended to both dismantle that system and ensure the civil liberties that Jim Crow illustrated were all too easily lost, <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> {{was to be the}} lasting monument of the <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> struggle. Fortified by this legacy, <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> retains a symbolic value, implying that there are formidable forces working to protect citizens from abusive state action, to ensure a broad anti-discrimination ethic, and to fix the wrongs of Jim Crow. The body of <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> promises much indeed. Only, today, it crumbles when one reaches for it, it disappoints when one seeks its solace, it disappears when it is needed most. It is a great ruin, a magnificent display of rotting grandeur. This article articulates theory explaining the demise of <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> and illustrates the operation of that theory in the demise of 42 U. S. C. § 1985 (3). The theory is that <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> litigation has been plagued from the beginning by an “activist insecurity” which has undercut <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> even during the “revival” period when courts were self-consciously seeking to expand <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> causes of action in the name of an age of rights. When the orientation of the courts changed-circa the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s 1977 and 1978 terms-the judicial style along with the legal precedents created {{under the influence of the}} activist insecurity made <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> particularly vulnerable. And, since about 1978 that law has been eviscerated, leaving a seemingly untouched carcass hanging trophy-like in the halls of conservative retrenchment...|$|R

25|$|State level laws vary {{significantly}} in their form, content, {{and level of}} restriction. Forty-four states have a provision in their state constitutions similar to the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which protects {{the right to keep}} and bear arms.

In New York, however, the statutory <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>laws</b> contain a provision virtually identical to the Second Amendment. Additionally, the U.S. Supreme Court held in McDonald v.

25|$|In 1987, 20 {{years after}} the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled in 1967's Loving v.

It also repealed the segregationist-era poll tax in 1989. In 1995, the state symbolically ratified the Thirteenth Amendment, which had abolished slavery in 1865. Though ratified in 1995, the state never officially notified the U.S. archivist, which kept the ratification unofficial until 2013, when Ken Sullivan contacted the office of Secretary of State of Mississippi, Delbert Hosemann, who agreed to file the paperwork and make it official. In 2009, the legislature passed a bill to repeal other discriminatory <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>laws,</b> which had been enacted in 1964, {{the same year as}} the federal Civil Rights Act, but ruled unconstitutional in 1967 by federal courts.
