40|$|Although American {{common law}} allows punitive damages for {{reckless}} or intentional torts, it will neither allow {{a jury to}} assess punitive damages for breach of contract nor permit enforcement of a contractual damages clause that is deemed to be punitive. This approach is rooted in an early Chancery practice of granting equitable relief from oppressive penal bonds and has been more recently justified {{as a means of}} facilitating efficient breach. Economic efficiency, however, can be accomplished even if punitive damages could be assessed for intentional breach, because the parties would have an incentive to negotiate a release from the first contract to enable both to share in the surplus offered by an intervening contractual opportunity. Moreover, negotiation of an enforceable penalty clause would allow some parties to maximize their utility by exchanging a signal of assurance of performance for a premium fee. Additionally, the French experience invites a fresh look, because – although it generally disallows punitive damages of a judicial origin for any civil wrong, tort or breach of contract [...] it honors freedom of contract and the autonomy of the parties by enforcing a <b>contractual</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>clause</b> (although the court may reduce an excessive contractual penalty). Taking a cue from the French approach, American courts and legislatures should reconsider their refusal to sanction freely negotiated penalty clauses and enforce them {{to the extent that they}} permit the parties to maximize their collective utility...|$|E

30|$|Many {{models and}} {{procedures}} for resource-constrained project scheduling problems (RCPSPs) assume that the capacities of the renewable resources that are required to perform the project’s activities are exogenously given and that {{the objective is to}} find a (feasible) schedule with a minimal project makespan or duration. In reality, the renewable resources like human labor or machinery are often temporarily assigned to a project and decisions on additional resources or overtime are made to achieve a short project duration. A short project duration may be economically attractive for different reasons. Consider, for example, software development projects or construction projects for factories. In such cases, a shorter project duration may permit an earlier market entry. This desire to achieve a short project duration can, e.g., lead to <b>contractual</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>clauses</b> or other incentive schemes that relate actual payments to project durations. In such cases, the revenue from a project typically decreases as its duration increases. This immediately leads to the question how to use overtime and how to schedule such projects with flexible capacity constraints and makespan-dependent revenues in the most profitable way.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} <b>contractual</b> <b>penalty</b> {{as a means}} of {{corroboration}} of a debt in business relations. The topic was chosen by the author primarily {{because of the fact that}} <b>contractual</b> <b>penalty</b> is a traditional institute of private law.

The aim of this thesis is to scientifically describe and analyze institute of <b>contractual</b> <b>penalty</b> as frequently used tool of corroboration of a debt in the context of the current, relatively new legislation. The work is based on rules of the Civil Code effective since 1. 1. 2014. At the same time, there is a great emphasis on jurisprudence. The work also abounds comparison with the previous legislation, which aims to capture the development of the concept of <b>contractual</b> <b>penalty.</b> The thesis focuses on the most important issues related to the <b>penalty</b> <b>clause.</b> At the same time it offers a comparison with the English legislation in the last chapter.

40|$|The author {{analyses}} {{the legal}} {{treatment of the}} <b>penalty</b> <b>clause</b> into Spanish Civil Law, with {{special attention to the}} regulation offered by the Civil Code in their articles 1152 to 1155, the differents functions which the <b>penalty</b> <b>clause</b> achieves and the differentiated regulation into Fuero Nuevo of Navarra in the Lex 518. All of this {{can be seen as a}} reflection of the dualism in Spanish Legal System between the Common Civil Law (represented by the Spanish Civil Code) and the Foral or Special Law (represented by differents regionals compilations). The regulation of the Spanish civil code sets as general rule the <b>contractual</b> <b>penalty</b> as substitute of the regime of compensation into the article 1101 of spanish Civil Code in case of breach of contract or in case of defective or untimely performance by the debtor. This provision allows to the creditor to avoid a real damage assessment, so that the <b>penalty</b> <b>clause</b> lets a advanced estimate of damages without needing to prove them. But also admits the regulation of the <b>penalty</b> <b>clause</b> into the spanish Civil Code other functions, for instance the cumulative penalty (with the legal and previously valued compensation of damages or with the specific performance). This regulation, unchanged since the enactment of the spanish Civil Code, has been object of special attention by the preliminary draft to modernisation of the law of obligations drawn up by the Commission of Codification of the Ministry of Justice in 2009, picking up some of the guidelines present in other European Civil Codes as well as in the contributions of prestigiouses scholars, which are expression of the effort aimed at the harmonisation of European Contract Law...|$|R

Considering the growing non-formality of legal relations in current society, it is possible to expect the increase of <b>contractual</b> <b>penalty's</b> importance in future. The aim of this thesis is to explore the institution of <b>contractual</b> <b>penalty</b> with focusing on actual application issues which arise from its practical use.

In this contribution {{we look at this}} question from a different angle by modelling a monopolist trying to find optimal prices when contracts without penalty as well as contracts with penalties are offered simultaneously to a class of buyers who face different levels of loss risks.

Therefore we conclude that full enforcement of <b>penalty</b> <b>clauses</b> as agreed upon is the best recommendation in order to reap benefits like optimal inter-party risk-allocation.

The author has chosen this topic because the <b>contractual</b> <b>penalty</b> is a traditional private institution, which enjoys great popularity for its function and relative simplicity of negotiation in current practice. The <b>contractual</b> <b>penalty</b> improves a creditorʼs status. It makes a borrowers fulfil their confirmed obligation since in case of its violation, they would have to provide the creditor with performance representing both generalized compensation of the damage and a penalty. In spite of a frequent use of the <b>contractual</b> <b>penalty,</b> its legislation is rather brief and does not cover all problematic aspects. The relevance of the topic increased with recodification of the private law. The main aim of the thesis is to explore legislative changes and their impact on selected problematic aspects of the <b>contractual</b> <b>penalty</b> using chosen methodology.

The Master degree's thesis is concerned with <b>contractual</b> <b>penalty.</b> The topic was chosen because <b>contractual</b> <b>penalty</b> has been an important often-used instrument of confirming debts for many years. Through its functions, it contributes to compliance with the fundamental principle of private law - "pacta sunt servanda". The aim of the study is to analyse and assess <b>contractual</b> <b>penalty</b> on the basis of valid Czech law, related judicial decisions and professional literature chiefly with the use of language, logical, systematic and teleological method of legal reasoning. The text is based on the Act No. 89 / 2012 Coll., The Civil Code, which is to become effective on 1 st January 2014. The Act's legal rules are compared to the former ones so that the changes of law can be described as a result of recodification of private law. The thesis is focused on the most important and the most discussed issues regarding <b>contractual</b> <b>penalty.</b> Chapter one is devoted to general characterization of <b>contractual</b> <b>penalty</b> with respect to its functions and accessory character.

Author chose this topic because <b>contractual</b> <b>penalty</b> is {{important}} and very often-used institute through which parties to the contract can secure their obligations. This instrument should guarantee that the debtor would perform his main (primary) commitment to the creditor.

The study is focused on issues of <b>contractual</b> <b>penalty</b> in commercial relations, specifically in a situation when both parties to the contract are businessmen and they entered into agreement in connection with their business. However the legislation of the instrument is relatively brief (articles 544 and 545 of the Act No. 40 / 1964 Coll., The Civil Code and articles 300 to 302 of the Act No. 513 / 1991 Coll., The Commercial Code, which includes a special regulation for business relations), many questions and uncertainties can be found.

These authors have the opinion that <b>penalty</b> <b>clauses</b> is an exclusive judgment of the compensation the victim has right to, that means that if the parties have put a lower amount in the clause the victim won’t get full coverage for the damages caused by the other party. That the <b>penalty</b> <b>clause</b> is an exclusive judgment of the victims right to compensation means that the victim doesn’t have the right to request other compensation above the compensation in the clause if nothing else is stated in the <b>clause.</b> A <b>penalty</b> <b>clause</b> may be viewed as a complement to compensation you get according to The Tort Liability Act (1972 : 206) where {{it is often difficult to}} obtain full compensation for damages when it is required that a number of conditions are to be met for damages deleted.
