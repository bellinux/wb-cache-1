40|$|PosterInternational audienceQuantum {{communication}} aims at generating {{and distributing}} entangled pairs of photonic qubits (or flying qubits) at a telecom wavelength between distant sites, {{in order to}} implement quantum information protocols, such as quantum key distribution, quantum teleportation and quantum processing. For many quantum protocols, and especially for quantum repeaters, which make quantum communication over long distances much more efficient, storing of entangled states is necessary and represents a crucial step towards the realization of a real quantum network. A <b>current</b> <b>outstanding</b> challenge is thus to implement quantum memories for entangled qubits, carried by telecom photons, that combine high efficiency, long storage time and near-perfect fidelity between the input and output states. With this project, {{our goal is to}} merge the techniques of telecom wavelengths qubit distribution with quantum storage at shorter wavelength (typically for atomic transitions). Our idea is to map, via a quantum interface, polarization entangled qubits at a telecom wave- length onto a cold atomic ensemble, serving as a quantum memory device...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} has highlighted the vital {{role played by}} dendrites in effecting the computational properties of single neurons in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). An ultraviolet (UV) acousto-optic laser scanning microscope system was developed that enables UV laser pulses to be delivered to multiple user-selected sites in the microscope's specimen plane with high spatial (< 10 mum) and temporal (< 20 mus) resolution. By employing "caged" neurotransmitters, the system can effect physiologically realistic spatio-temporal patterns of "synaptic" stimulation to the dendrites of a single cultured neuron. This system was combined with a previously developed acousto-optic laser scanning system for fast, multi-site optical recording of electrical activity (Bullen et al. 1999). This combination [...] -the "Dual Scanner" [...] -allows the study of important dendritic questions such as the underlying mechanisms of spatial and temporal summation.

40|$|Cancer-related {{inflammation}} {{has emerged}} {{in recent years as}} a major event contributing to tumor angiogenesis, tumor progression and metastasis formation. Bone marrow-derived and inflammatory cells promote tumor angiogenesis by providing endothelial progenitor cells that differentiate into mature endothelial cells, and by secreting pro-angiogenic factors and remodeling the extracellular matrix to stimulate angiogenesis though paracrine mechanisms. Several bone marrow-derived myelonomocytic cells, including monocytes and macrophages, have been identified and characterized by several laboratories in recent years. While the central role of these cells in promoting tumor angiogenesis, tumor progression and metastasis is nowadays well established, many questions remain open and new ones are emerging. These include the relationship between their phenotype and function, the mechanisms of pro-angiogenic programming, their contribution to resistance to anti-angiogenic treatments and to metastasis and their potential clinical use as biomarkers of angiogenesis and anti-angiogenic therapies. Here, we will review phenotypical and functional aspects of bone marrow-derived myelonomocytic cells and discuss some of the <b>current</b> <b>outstanding</b> questions...|$|R

The 5. 0 V output is accurate within ± 2. 0 % and supplies 100 mA {{of load current}} with a typical dropout voltage of only 400 mV. Microprocessor control logic includes an ENABLE input and an active RESET. This combination of low quiescent <b>current,</b> <b>outstanding</b> regulator performance and control logic makes the CS 8101 ideal for any battery operated, microprocessor controlled equipment.

The logic level compatible ENABLE input allows the user to put the regulator into a shutdown mode where it draws only 20 �A typical of quiescent current.
