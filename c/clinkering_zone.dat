The application of the method to oxide systems is much more recent, {{because of the difficulty}} of modelling the ionic liquid phase. Since the 1980 s, several models have been proposed by various communities. Thermodynamic databases for oxides are available and still under development. The {{purpose of this article is}} to discuss the distinct approaches of the method for the calculation of multi-component systems for Portland cement elaboration. The article gives a state of the art of the most recent experimental data and the various calculations for the CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 phase diagram. A literature review of the three binary sub-systems leads to main conclusions: (i) discrepancies are found in the literature for the selected experimental data, (ii) the phase diagram data in the reference books are not complete and up to date and (iii) the two-sublattices model and the modified quasichemical model can be equally used for the modelling of the aluminates liquid. The predictive feature of the CALPHAD method is illustrated using the CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 system with the two-sublattices model: extrapolated (predicted) and fully-assessed phase diagrams are compared in the <b>clinkering</b> <b>zone</b> of interest. The recent application of the predictive method for the calculations of high-order systems (taking into account Fe 2 O 3, SO 3, CaF 2, P 2 O 5) shows that the databases developed with the two-sublattices model and the modified quasichemical model are no longer equivalent...|$|E
40|$|Hydration of clinker {{particles}} is since long a {{topic of}} interest in both designing and optimizing cement composition and its quantity used in concrete. The interest for carefully observing and also quantifying the type or stage of clinker hydration in hardened cement paste is twofold. Firstly, {{the characteristics of the}} hydration features can give useful information on the actual hydration mechanisms (e. g., diffusion versus dissolution). Secondly, considering the different hydration stages more quantitatively can help to study for example the amount of hydration or hydration rate in different types of concrete. In this paper, it is shown that polarization and fluorescent light microscopy (PFM) and backscattered electron microscopy (BSE) can be used to quantify different clinker hydration types in hardened cement paste. Different stages or types of hydration could be distinguished in the clinker grains: (A) unhydrated clinker core without a visible hydration rim, (B) hydrated clinker ‘imprint’, (C) hydrated clinker core with an unhydrated clinker rim and (D) unhydrated clinker core with a clear hydration rim. These different types of clinker hydration can be quantified using point counting. In fluorescent light, the hydrated <b>clinker</b> <b>zones</b> contain more fluorescent dye compared to the unhydrated clinker parts and also {{to the rest of the}} cement paste. This suggests that the clinker may have partly or fully dissolved, creating porosity and that the hydration products have precipitated further away from the clinker particle, resulting in a less porous hardened cement paste. In other words, dissolution and precipitation processes might play a role in the hydration mechanism. Quantifying these different clinker types could also be useful for estimating for example the amount of hydration that took place, or for quantifying the ‘overcapacity’ of unhydrated clinker. The latter gives interesting information to possibly reduce the amount of clinker and as such lower the CO 2 footprint of concrete...|$|R

All constituents {{of these products}} have to resist not only to thermal constraints, {{but also to the}} thermochemical solicitations which result from contact material/coating. In order to study the phenomenon of degradation of refractory bricks in cement kilns and to identify the causes of their degradation, we proceed to the examination of industrial cases in cement kiln. Many chemical tests of the degraded refractory bricks have been done and the results acquired were compared to the ones not used. The analysis of the results is doing using different techniques (Loss of ignition, X-ray Fluorescence, X-ray Diffraction). The results show that the degradation of the used bricks in the <b>clinkering</b> and cooling <b>zone</b> is due to the infiltration of aggressive elements such us sulphur, alkali (Na 2 O, K 2 O [...] .). The chemical interaction between the Portland clinker phases and refractory material has also an importance on the stability of the coating and consequently on the life of the refractories...|$|R
