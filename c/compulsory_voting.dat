5|$|During the war, {{two state}} {{elections}} were held, in 1941 and 1944. In the 1941 election, {{there was a}} significant decrease in the independent vote, and both the Labor Party and the LCL made gains, with Playford forming the LCL's first majority government. This was in large part due to the LCL's shift to the right on social issues to usurp the independents' appeal. In 1942, <b>compulsory</b> <b>voting</b> (but not enrolment) was introduced, and first took effect at the 1944 election, with an increase in voter turnout from 51% to 89%. Again Playford won with a one-seat LCL majority, hanging on {{with the help of the}} malapportioned electoral system.|$|E

However, his wish for national sovereignty often led him to policies contrary to colonialist interests.|$|R

25|$|<b>Compulsory</b> <b>voting</b> was {{introduced}} for the Queensland state election in 1915, {{at the federal}} level in 1924, and Victoria introduced it for the Legislative Assembly at the 1927 state election and for Legislative Council elections in 1935. New South Wales and Tasmania introduced <b>compulsory</b> <b>voting</b> in 1928, Western Australia in 1936 and South Australia in 1942. In South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia voting at local elections is not compulsory. Australia enforces <b>compulsory</b> <b>voting.</b> About 5% of enrolled voters fail to vote at most elections. People in this situation are asked to explain their failure to vote. If no satisfactory reason is provided (for example, illness or religious prohibition), a fine of up to $170 is imposed, and failure to pay the fine may result in a court hearing and additional costs.|$|E
25|$|The {{immediate}} {{justification for}} <b>compulsory</b> <b>voting</b> {{at the federal}} level was the low voter turnout (59.38%) at the 1922 federal election, down from 71.59% at the 1919 federal election. <b>Compulsory</b> <b>voting</b> was not on the platform of either the Stanley Bruce-led Nationalist/Country party coalition government or the Matthew Charlton-led Labor opposition. The actual initiative for change was made by Herbert Payne, a backbench Tasmanian Nationalists senator who on 16 July 1924 introduced a private member's bill in the Senate. Payne's bill was passed with little debate (the House of Representatives agreeing to it in less than an hour), and in neither house was a division required, hence no votes were recorded against the bill. It received Royal Assent on 31 July 1924 as the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1924. The 1925 federal election was the first to be conducted under <b>compulsory</b> <b>voting,</b> which saw the turnout figure rise to 91.4%. The turnout increased to about 95% within a couple of elections and has stayed at about that level since. <b>Compulsory</b> <b>voting</b> at referendums was considered when a referendum was proposed in 1915, but, as the referendum was never held, the idea was put on hold.|$|E

25|$|Peter Singer, in Democracy and Disobedience, {{argues that}} <b>compulsory</b> <b>voting</b> could negate the {{obligation}} of a voter to support {{the outcome of the}} election, since voluntary participation in elections is deemed {{to be one of the}} sources of the obligation to obey the law in a democracy. In 1996 Albert Langer was jailed for three weeks on contempt charges in relation to a constitutional challenge on a legal way not to vote for either of the major parties. Chong, Davidson and Fry, writing in the journal of the right wing think tank the CIS, argue that Australian <b>compulsory</b> <b>voting</b> is disreputable, paternalistic, disadvantages smaller political parties, and allows major parties to target marginal seats and make some savings in pork-barrelling because of this targeting. Chong et al. also argue that denial is a significant aspect of the debate about <b>compulsory</b> <b>voting.</b>|$|E
25|$|Voter {{turnout was}} 92.9%, with 527,919 of the 586,098 {{registered}} voters casting votes. This {{was a huge}} turnout, especially {{when compared to the}} 1955 elections in which turnout was only 52.7%. The increase was largely down to the implementation of <b>compulsory</b> <b>voting</b> and the removal of suffrage restrictions.|$|E
25|$|When <b>compulsory</b> <b>voting</b> was {{introduced}} in Victoria in 1926 for the Legislative Assembly, the turnout increased from 59.24% at the 1924 state election to 91.76% at the 1927 state election, but the informal vote increased from 1.01% in 1924 to 1.94% in 1927.

40|$|Using a panel-model approach, {{this paper}} investigates the {{validity}} of the relationship between level of tax revenues and type of voting. The data-set covers the period 2000 - 2010, and includes 135 countries.

The analysis in this paper covers the “gap” in the literature in this field. ...|$|R
25|$|The Australian {{electoral system}} {{comprises}} {{the laws and}} processes used for the election {{of members of the}} Australian Parliament. The system presently has a number of distinctive features including compulsory enrolment, <b>compulsory</b> <b>voting,</b> majority-preferential instant-runoff voting in single-member seats to elect the lower house, the House of Representatives, {{and the use of the}} single transferable vote proportional representation system to elect the upper house, the Senate.|$|E
25|$|Some {{practices}} overlaid on PR-STV, however, {{may encourage}} {{the role of}} political parties and actually strengthen them. In Australian Senate elections, where a combination of large districts, mandatory complete ballots, and <b>compulsory</b> <b>voting</b> has resulted - since they were introduced in 1983 - in the near 95% usage of partisan group voting tickets, political parties gain significant power in determining election results by adjusting the relative ordering of their candidates.|$|E
25|$|The {{election}} of the president was carried out using the ballotage system, {{a modified version of}} the two-round system in which a candidate would win if they received 45% of the vote, or if they received 40% of the vote and were 10 percentage points ahead of the second-place candidate. Voting is compulsory for citizens between 18 and 70 years old. Suffrage was also extended to 16- and 17-year-olds, though without <b>compulsory</b> <b>voting.</b>|$|E
25|$|As <b>voting</b> is <b>compulsory</b> in Belgium, and all electors are {{automatically}} on the electoral rolls (extracted from a computerized National Register), foreign residents have to enlist voluntarily on the electoral roll, then only they are {{submitted to the}} <b>compulsory</b> <b>vote.</b> At the 2006 Municipal elections, only 20.9% (110,973 out of 529,878) of the potential EU voters enlisted (17.6%, or 87,858 out of 498,315 at the 2000 Municipal elections), and 15.7% (17,065 out of 108,607) of the potential non-EU voters.|$|R
50|$|An {{election}} is considered free {{if the government}} does not compel the people's voting decision in terms of content. According to the Federal Constitutional Court's dispensation of justice the principle of a free ballot would not be harmed if a <b>compulsory</b> <b>vote</b> was introduced by the Federal Electoral Law. Electoral advertising at government expense would, however, be incompatible with this principle of electoral law. However, the Federal Government (made up of different political parties) is allowed to conduct public relations if its neutrality is strictly preserved.|$|R
50|$|Donkey votes {{have been}} {{observed}} in democracies other than Australia, even those without <b>compulsory</b> preferential <b>voting,</b> although {{the presence of these}} two factors in Australia makes the phenomenon more visible.|$|R
25|$|A counter {{argument}} to opponents of <b>compulsory</b> <b>voting</b> {{is that in}} these systems the individual still has the practical ability to abstain at the polls by voting informally if they so choose, due to the secrecy of the ballot. A spoilt vote does not count towards any political party and effectively {{is the same as}} choosing not to vote under a non-compulsory voting system. However, Singer argues that even the appearance of voluntary participation is sufficient to create an obligation to obey the law.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the ballot}} marking is more complex, {{there can be}} an {{increase}} in spoiled ballots. In Australia, voters are required to write a number beside every candidate, and error rates can be five times higher than plurality voting elections Since Australia has <b>compulsory</b> <b>voting,</b> however, it is difficult to tell how many ballots are deliberately spoiled. Most jurisdictions with IRV do not require complete rankings and may use columns to indicate preference instead of numbers. In American elections with IRV, more than 99% of voters typically cast a valid ballot.|$|E
25|$|Belgium is a constitutional, popular monarchy and {{a federal}} {{parliamentary}} democracy. The bicameral federal parliament is composed of a Senate and a Chamber of Representatives. The former {{is made up of}} 50 senators appointed by the parliaments of the communities and regions and 10 co-opted senators. Prior to 2014, most of the Senate's members were directly elected. The Chamber's 150 representatives are elected under a proportional voting system from 11 electoral districts. Belgium has <b>compulsory</b> <b>voting</b> and thus maintains one of the highest rates of voter turnout in the world.|$|E
50|$|It was <b>compulsory</b> to <b>vote</b> at the referendum, and 1,148,851 voters, {{representing}} 85.64% of enrolled voters, {{turned out}} to cast a vote. Non-voters faced a fine of $20 to $50.|$|R

50|$|On {{eviction}} night, all houseguests vote {{to evict}} {{one of the}} two nominees, {{with the exception of the}} nominees and the Head of Household, who is only allowed to vote in the event of a tie, and in that case, must do so publicly. This <b>compulsory</b> <b>vote</b> is conducted in the privacy of the Diary Room. Unlike most other versions of Big Brother, the houseguests may openly and freely discuss the nomination and eviction process. The nominee with the majority of votes will be evicted from the house on the weekly live broadcast, exiting to an adjacent studio to be interviewed by Chen, after which the cycle begins again.|$|R
25|$|One {{example is}} voting in the United States. Even though most {{people say that}} voting is important, and a good {{practice}} for them to do, every year a sub-optimal percentage of Americans turn up to vote, especially in presidential elections (only 51% in the 2000 election). One vote may feel very small {{in a group of}} millions, so people may not think a vote is worth the time and effort. If too many people think this way, there is a small percentage of voter turnout. Some countries enforce <b>compulsory</b> <b>voting</b> to reduce this effect.|$|E
