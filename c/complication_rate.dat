25|$|Misoprostol is {{used for}} {{self-induced}} abortions in Brazil, where black market prices exceed US$100 per dose. Illegal medically unsupervised misoprostol abortions in Brazil {{are associated with a}} lower <b>complication</b> <b>rate</b> than other forms of illegal self-induced abortion, but are still associated with a higher <b>complication</b> <b>rate</b> than legal, medically supervised surgical and medical abortions. Failed misoprostol abortions are associated with birth defects in some cases. Low-income and immigrant populations in New York City have also been observed to use self-administered misoprostol to induce abortions, as this method is much cheaper than a surgical abortion (about $2 per dose). The drug is readily available in Mexico. Use of misoprostol has also increased in Texas in response to increased regulation of abortion providers.|$|E

25|$|Screening for {{carotid artery}} {{narrowing}} {{has not been}} shown to be a useful test in the general population. Studies of surgical intervention for carotid artery stenosis without symptoms have shown only a small decrease in the risk of stroke.

Even then, for 100 surgeries, 5 patients will benefit by avoiding stroke, 3 will develop stroke despite surgery, 3 will develop stroke or die due to the surgery itself, and 89 will remain stroke-free but would also have done so without intervention.|$|E
30|$|Introduction: Hysterectomy {{is one of}} {{the most}} common gynaecological {{procedures}} and may be performed either by vaginal approach, laparotomy or laparoscopy. Although TLH has multiple advantages, there have been conflicting reports on major <b>complication</b> <b>rates.</b> The aims of this study were to describe our experience performing TLH and to evaluate the <b>complication</b> <b>rates.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to retrospectively analyze the clinical outcomes and <b>complication</b> <b>rates</b> of our thoracostomy tube management protocol and then review and compare the literature with the possibility of implementing our algorithm as a general guideline for all institutions, and more importantly improve patient care. The <b>complication</b> <b>rates,</b> duration of thoracostomy tubes and length of hospital stay were collected as primary outcome variables. Secondary outcome variables included the injury severity scores in relation to thoracostomy tube duration, mechanism of trauma, time of air leak, suction, water seal, and the relative thoracostomy tube outputs in relation to <b>complication</b> <b>rates.</b>|$|R

500|$|Neonatal {{circumcision}} {{is generally}} safe when done by an experienced practitioner. The most common acute complications are bleeding, infection and {{the removal of}} either {{too much or too little}} foreskin. [...] These complications occur in approximately 0.12% of procedures, and constitute the vast majority of all acute circumcision complications in the United States. [...] Minor complications are reported to occur in three percent of procedures. Severe complications are rare. A specific <b>complication</b> <b>rate</b> is difficult to determine due to scant data on complications and inconsistencies in their classification. Complication rates are greater when the procedure is performed by an inexperienced operator, in unsterile conditions, or when the child is at an older age. Significant acute complications happen rarely, occurring in about 1 in 500 newborn procedures in the United States. Severe to catastrophic complications, including death, are so rare that they are reported only as individual case reports. Other possible complications include buried penis, chordee, phimosis, skin bridges, urethral fistulas, and meatal stenosis. These complications may be avoided with proper technique, and are most often treatable without requiring a hospital visit.|$|E
500|$|Evidence {{supports}} that male circumcision {{reduces the risk}} of HIV infection among heterosexual men in sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, the WHO recommends considering circumcision as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention program in areas with high rates of HIV such as sub-Saharan Africa. Evidence for a health benefit against HIV for {{men who have sex with}} men is less clear. Likewise, the effectiveness of using circumcision to prevent HIV in the developed world is also unclear. Circumcision is associated with reduced rates of cancer causing forms of human papillomavirus (HPV), UTIs, and cancer of the penis. Prevention of those conditions is not a justification for routine circumcision of infants. Studies of its potential protective effects against other sexually transmitted infections have been unclear. A 2010 review found circumcisions performed by medical providers to have a typical <b>complication</b> <b>rate</b> of 1.5% for babies and 6% for older children, with few cases of severe complications. Bleeding, infection, and the removal of either too much or too little foreskin are the most common complications cited. Complication rates are higher when the procedure is performed by an inexperienced operator, in unsterile conditions, or in older children. Circumcision [...] does not appear to have a negative impact on sexual function.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} the <b>complication</b> <b>rates</b> of tension-free midurethral slings {{compared with other}} surgical treatments for stress urinary incontinence, including other tension-free midurethral slings. Methods: A systematic {{review of the literature}} using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science was performed in January 2007. Meta-analysis was conducted by using the Review Manager software 4. 2. Results: Our search identified 33 randomized controlled trials reporting data on <b>complication</b> <b>rates.</b> Our meta-analysis showed that <b>complication</b> <b>rates</b> were similar after tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) and Burch colposuspension, with the exclusion of bladder perforation, which was more common after TVT (p = 0. 0001), and reoperation rate, which was significantly higher after Burch colposuspension (p = 0. 02). TVT and pubovaginal sling were followed by similar <b>complication</b> <b>rates.</b> With regards to the comparisons among retropubic tapes, TVT and intravaginal slingplasty had similar <b>complication</b> <b>rates,</b> whereas suprapubic arc sling (SPARC) was complicated by higher rates of voiding lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) (p = 0. 02) and reoperations (p = 0. 04). Comparing retropubic and transobturator tapes, the occurrence of bladder perforations (p = 0. 007), pelvic haematoma (p = 0. 03), and storage LUTS (p = 0. 01) was significantly less common in patients treated by transobturator tapes. Conclusions: Tension-free slings were followed by lower risk of reoperation compared with Burch colposuspension, whereas pubovaginal sling and tension-free midurethral slings had similar <b>complication</b> <b>rates.</b> With regards to different tension-free tapes, voiding LUTS and reoperations were more common after SPARC, whereas bladder perforations, pelvic haematoma, and storage LUTS were less common after transobturator tapes.

40|$|Objective: This {{study is}} planned to {{evaluate}} {{the relationship between the}} complications that have occurred in our clinic after tissue expander application and patient age, sex, etiology, expander placement site, tissue expander volume, final expander volume, perioperative inflation volume, and tissue expander inflation duration. Materials and Methods: Seventy-eight tissue expanders of different sizes were placed in patients. Patients’ age, sex, etiology, tissue expander site, tissue expander volume, preoperative final expander volume, tissue expander inflation duration, and complications were retrospectively documented. The Number Cruncher Statistical System 2007 and Power Analysis and Sample Size 2008 statistical software (Utah, USA) programs were used for statistical analysis. Results: No relationships between <b>complication</b> <b>rates</b> and patient age, sex, tissue expander volume, perioperative inflation volume, preoperative final expander volume, overexpansion, and inflation duration were observed. <b>Complication</b> <b>rates</b> in the lower extremity and burn scar group were markedly higher than the trunk, head-neck, and trauma scar groups.
