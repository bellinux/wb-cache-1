In this study, veterans with a unilateral lower-limb amputation participated in a survey about health beliefs and health practices known to affect risk of amputation (foot care and smoking). Most participants reported good foot-care practices (93 % checked the top of their foot, 73 % <b>checked</b> the <b>bottom</b> of their foot, 75 % checked between their toes, and 72 % washed their foot daily); however, a small percentage engaged in important foot-care practices less than once a week (2 % checked the top of their foot, 7 % <b>checked</b> the <b>bottom</b> of their foot, and 7 % checked between their toes less than once a week). In addition, nearly a third still smoked. The belief in one’s ability to engage in good foot care and the belief that good foot care reduces the risk of future foot problems wer...|$|R

The <b>check</b> symbol's <b>bottom</b> half value is 1, so it corresponds to the letter I.|$|R

5000|$|Before {{construction}} {{began the}} sea lamprey, {{which had been}} devastating the fishing industry in the Great Lakes, was found in Gloucester Pool—at {{the bottom of the}} railway—and plans were put on hold. Several impractical ideas were suggested, but no practical solution could be found. By the end of the 1960s the old marine railway could not keep up with the amount of boating traffic in the area. Long lines formed {{at either end of the}} railway, with waits often being overnight. Research was done to find a way to prevent the migration of the sea lamprey into Lake Couchiching and Lake Simcoe, while still effectively increasing the flow of traffic. A biologist sat at the bottom of the railway for days, <b>checking</b> the <b>bottom</b> of boats that locked through, and finally saw a lamprey attached to the bottom of a boat. The lamprey fell off after less than 6 meters, so the railway was determined to be effective at preventing the sea lamprey's migration.

[...] "The savagery of American violence," [...] he says, [...] "begins with Chigurh's introduction: a quick one-two punch of strangulation and a bloody cattle gun. The strangulation in particular demonstrates {{the level of the}} Coens' capability to create realistic carnage-to allow the audience to understand the horror that violence delivers.....Chigurh kills a total of 12 (possibly more) people, and, curiously enough, the violence devolves as the film progresses. During {{the first half of the}} film, the Coens never shy from unleashing Chigurh ... The devolution of violence starts with Chigurh's shootout with Moss in the motel. Aside from the truck owner who is shot in the head after Moss flags him down, both the motel clerk and Wells's death occur offscreen. Wells's death in particular demonstrates that murder means nothing. Calm beyond comfort, the camera pans away when Chigurh shoots Wells with a silenced shotgun as the phone rings. He answers. It is Moss, and while they talk, blood oozes across the room toward Chigurh's feet. Not moving, he places his feet up on the bed and continues the conversation as the blood continues to spread across the floor. By the time he keeps his promise of visiting Carla Jean, the resolution and the violence appear incomplete. Though we're not shown Carla Jean's death, when Chigurh exits and <b>checks</b> the <b>bottom</b> of his socks [...] for blood, it's a clear indication that his brand of violence has struck again." ...|$|R
40|$|Today most on-site systems fail {{due to lack}} of {{monitoring}} and maintenance. For instance, the septic tank, which is the most common on-site system, requires periodic <b>checking</b> of the <b>bottom</b> sludge layer and the top scum layer, so that the homeowner knows when it is time to pump it out. Otherwise, the scum and sludge layers may become too thick and eventually overflow into the leach field, which may clog both the leach lines and the soil. If the soil gets clogged, the bacteria contaminated water may surface and cause ponding. Clogging of the leach lines may cause the wastewater to back up into the house. One {{of the reasons for the}} lack {{of monitoring}} is that the layers have to be manually checked, which requires working with wastewater and risking bacteria and virus contamination. Some homeowners may not even know where the septic tank is buried. MicroSepTec has developed the first intelligent wastewater treatment system called the EnviroServer. The EnviroServer itself can be described as a hybrid fixed film-suspended growth extended aeration system with a two-stage biological process to optimize denitrification and on-site destruction of sludge.

40|$|Rural community, which {{constitutes}} {{more than}} 70 % {{of the total}} population in India, faces an everyday struggle to meet basic water requirements. The challenges in this struggle are numerous: lack of infrastructure, limited access to new water resources, over-dependence on groundwater resources, and high spatial and temporal variability of monsoon. In addition, these issues are aggravated by the lack of hydrologic and water management understanding among the water using community. To address such problems, water engineers and managers often resort to complicated hydrologic models. These models may capture the global hydrological processes more accurately but their data requirement and set up is highly complicated, let alone the implementation at village scale. This thesis proposes a simpler modeling approach which integrates the local conditions and typical hydrological processes within reasonable assumptions to develop a practical tool which can be used directly by the stakeholders (local water authorities and village community). For prototype model development, we identify a case study of Jivapar village located in Gujarat state of India. We propose a conceptual framework which interlinks components like climate, surface water, groundwater flow, domestic water demand, and pumping for irrigation through water balance approach. Based on this framework, we build a mathematical model to understand the relevance of different system parameters in increasing water system reliability. We use number of days village gets basic water supply as the indicator of system reliability. We calibrate the model by simulating year 2010 as baseline scenario. We also use the model to evaluate the system behavior with respect to changes in climatic conditions, land use, check dam properties and hydrologic parameters like porosity and hydraulic conductivity. We show that factors like evapotranspiration, hydraulic conductivity and properties of <b>check</b> dam <b>bottom</b> soil have significant impact on local water supply. Through the process of model development, scenario simulations, and discussion on policy implications, we illustrate the utility of proposed model in furthering general water system understanding, and in strategic and functional water resources planning through scenario modeling, decision support, policy analysis and infrastructure design. by Himani Gupta.
