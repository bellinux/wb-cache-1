25|$|<b>Compressed</b> <b>{{hydrogen}}</b> is {{a storage}} form where hydrogen gas is kept under pressures {{to increase the}} storage density. <b>Compressed</b> <b>hydrogen</b> in hydrogen tanks at 350 bar (5,000 psi) and 700 bar (10,000 psi) is used for hydrogen tank systems in vehicles, based on type IV carbon-composite technology. Car manufacturers have been developing this solution, such as Honda or Nissan.|$|E
25|$|<b>Compressed</b> <b>hydrogen,</b> by comparison, {{is stored}} quite differently. Hydrogen gas has good energy density by weight, but poor energy density by volume versus hydrocarbons, hence it {{requires}} a larger tank to store. A large hydrogen tank will be heavier than the small hydrocarbon tank used to store {{the same amount of}} energy, all other factors remaining equal. Increasing gas pressure would improve the energy density by volume, making for smaller, but not lighter container tanks (see hydrogen tank). <b>Compressed</b> <b>hydrogen</b> costs 2.1% of the energy content to power the compressor. Higher compression without energy recovery will mean more energy lost to the compression step. <b>Compressed</b> <b>hydrogen</b> storage can exhibit very low permeation.|$|E
25|$|The {{hydrogen}} infrastructure would consist {{mainly of}} industrial hydrogen pipeline transport and hydrogen-equipped filling stations like those {{found on a}} hydrogen highway. Hydrogen stations which were not situated near a hydrogen pipeline would get supply via hydrogen tanks, <b>compressed</b> <b>hydrogen</b> tube trailers, liquid hydrogen trailers, liquid hydrogen tank trucks or dedicated onsite production.|$|E
50|$|The {{photograph}} {{included in}} this section depicts a three-stage diaphragm compressor used to <b>compress</b> <b>hydrogen</b> gas to 6,000 psi (41 MPa) {{for use in a}} prototype <b>hydrogen</b> and <b>compressed</b> natural gas (CNG) fueling station built in downtown Phoenix, Arizona by the Arizona Public Service company (an electric utilities company). Reciprocating compressors were used to compress the natural gas.|$|R
50|$|When {{water is}} {{pressurized}} and then electrolysis is conducted at those high pressures, the produced hydrogen gas is pre-compressed at around 120-200 bar (1740-2900 psi). By pre-pressurising the hydrogen in the electrolyser, energy is saved {{as the need}} for an external hydrogen compressor is eliminated. The average energy consumption for internal compression is around 3%. The energy required to compress water is very much less than that required to <b>compress</b> <b>hydrogen</b> gas.|$|R
50|$|A proven {{method to}} <b>compress</b> <b>Hydrogen</b> {{is to apply}} {{reciprocating}} piston compressors. Widely used in refineries, they are the backbone of refining crude oil. Reciprocating piston compressors are commonly available as either oil-lubricated or non-lubricated; for high pressure (350 - 700 bar), non-lubricated compressors are preferred to avoid oil contamination of the Hydrogen. Expert know-how on piston sealing and packing rings can ensure that reciprocating compressors outperform the competing technologies in terms of MTBO (Mean Time Between Overhaul).|$|R
25|$|High {{pressure}} electrolysis is the electrolysis of water by {{decomposition of water}} (H2O) into oxygen (O2) and hydrogen gas (H2) {{by means of an}} electric current being passed through the water. The difference with a standard electrolyzer is the <b>compressed</b> <b>hydrogen</b> output around 120-200 bar (1740-2900 psi, 12–20 MPa). By pressurising the hydrogen in the electrolyser, through a process known as chemical compression, the need for an external hydrogen compressor is eliminated, the average energy consumption for internal compression is around 3%.|$|E
25|$|Helium-4 is {{a liquid}} at normal {{pressure}} near absolute zero, {{a consequence of}} its high zero-point energy (ZPE). The ZPE of protons in a dense state is also high, {{and a decline in}} the ordering energy (relative to the ZPE) is expected at high pressures. Arguments have been advanced by Neil Ashcroft and others that there is a melting point maximum in <b>compressed</b> <b>hydrogen,</b> but also {{that there might be a}} range of densities, at pressures around , where hydrogen would be a liquid metal, even at low temperatures.|$|E
25|$|Increasing gas {{pressure}} improves the energy density by volume, making for smaller, but not lighter container tanks (see pressure vessel). Achieving higher pressures necessitates {{greater use of}} external energy to power the compression. The mass of the hydrogen tanks needed for <b>compressed</b> <b>hydrogen</b> reduces the fuel economy of the vehicle. Because {{it is a small}} molecule, hydrogen tends to diffuse through any liner material intended to contain it, leading to the embrittlement, or weakening, of its container. The most common method of on board hydrogen storage in today's demonstration vehicles is as a compressed gas at pressures of roughly 700bar (70MPa).|$|E
50|$|Bussard {{proposed}} a ramjet variant of a fusion rocket capable of reasonable interstellar travel, using enormous electromagnetic fields (ranging from kilometers to {{many thousands of}} kilometers in diameter) as a ram scoop to collect and <b>compress</b> <b>hydrogen</b> from the interstellar medium. High speeds force the reactive mass into a progressively constricted magnetic field, compressing it until thermonuclear fusion occurs. The magnetic field then directs the energy as rocket exhaust opposite to the intended direction of travel, thereby accelerating the vessel.|$|R
5000|$|An {{ionic liquid}} {{compressor}} {{takes advantage of}} two properties of ionic liquids—their virtually non-measurable vapor pressures and large temperature window for the liquid phase—in combination with the low solubility of some gasses (e.g. hydrogen) in them. This insolubility is exploited by using the body of an ionic liquid to <b>compress</b> <b>hydrogen</b> up to 1000 bar (14,500 psi) in hydrogen filling stations. [...] Linde's ionic liquid compressor {{reduced the number of}} moving parts from about 500 in a conventional reciprocating compressor down to 8.|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen {{reaches the}} minimum {{conductivity}} of a metal at 140 GPa (1. 4 Mbar) and 3000 K. These conditions were achieved using a two-stage light-gas gun. The authors have investigated computationally {{the use of}} a laser-heated hohlraum to shock <b>compress</b> <b>hydrogen</b> to these conditions in samples sufficiently thin that the metallic fluid might be quenched metastably on release of dynamic pressure. A configuration was found such that the duration of maximum pressure is sufficiently long that the hydrogen film cools by thermal conduction before pressure is released...|$|R
25|$|Soluble {{ruthenium}} catalysts {{are also}} effective. Carbon monoxide free hydrogen has been generated {{in a very}} wide pressure range (1–600 bar). Formic acid has been considered {{as a means of}} hydrogen storage. The co-product of this decomposition, carbon dioxide, can be rehydrogenated back to formic acid in a second step. Formic acid contains 53 g L−1 hydrogen at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, which is three and a half times as much as <b>compressed</b> <b>hydrogen</b> gas can attain at 350 bar pressure (14.7 g L−1). Pure formic acid is a liquid with a flash point of +69°C, much higher than that of gasoline (40°C) or ethanol (+13°C).|$|E
25|$|Due {{to their}} light weight, PEMFCs are most suited for {{transportation}} applications. PEMFCs for buses, which use <b>compressed</b> <b>hydrogen</b> for fuel, can operate {{at up to}} 40% efficiency. Generally PEMFCs are implemented on buses over smaller cars because of the available volume to house the system and store the fuel. Technical issues for transportation involve incorporation of PEMs into current vehicle technology and updating energy systems. Full fuel cell vehicles are not advantageous if hydrogen is sourced from fossil fuels; however, they become beneficial when implemented as hybrids. There is potential for PEMFCs {{to be used for}} stationary power generation, where they provide 5kW at 30% efficiency; however, they run into competition with other types of fuel cells, mainly SOFCs and MCFCs. Whereas PEMFCs generally require high purity hydrogen for operation, other fuel cell types can run on methane and are thus more flexible systems. Therefore, PEMFCs are best for small scale systems until economically scalable pure hydrogen is available. Furthermore, PEMFCs have the possibility of replacing batteries for portable electronics, though integration of the hydrogen supply is a technical challenge particularly without a convenient location to store it within the device.|$|E
500|$|The {{energy density}} per unit volume of both liquid {{hydrogen}} and <b>compressed</b> <b>hydrogen</b> gas at any practicable pressure is {{significantly less than}} that of traditional fuel sources, although the energy density per unit fuel mass is higher. Nevertheless, elemental hydrogen has been widely discussed in the context of energy, as a possible future carrier of energy on an economy-wide scale. For example, [...] sequestration followed by carbon capture and storage could be conducted at the point of [...] production from fossil fuels. Hydrogen used in transportation would burn relatively cleanly, with some NOx emissions, but without carbon emissions. However, the infrastructure costs associated with full conversion to a hydrogen economy would be substantial. Fuel cells can convert hydrogen and oxygen directly to electricity more efficiently than internal combustion engines.|$|E
2500|$|The {{history of}} {{hydrogen}} and its methods of production are then described. [...] The book {{claims that the}} most common and cost-effective method of hydrogen production is from natural gas, which emits large amounts of CO2 (a greenhouse gas), since it would require too much electric power to produce hydrogen using the electrolysis method. [...] The monetary costs of hydrogen fueling infrastructure for the U.S. are then estimated at half a trillion U.S. dollars, and the book describes additional energy and environment costs to liquefy and <b>compress</b> <b>hydrogen</b> for use in fueling stations.|$|R
50|$|The {{amount of}} energy {{available}} to the external load is the difference in electrical potential between that needed to <b>compress</b> <b>hydrogen</b> at low-temperature and that which expanding it at high-temperature generates. Unlike other heat pump devices, the JTEC requires an initial input of electrical energy to start the compression stage and initiate the cycle. The engine can also be operated in reverse to convert electrical energy into a temperature differential, for example in HVAC applications. In the proposed application, solar irradiance would heat the power stage and the compression stage connect to an ambient temperature heat sink.|$|R

2500|$|Neither {{industry}} directly replaces hydrocarbons. [...] Reykjavík, Iceland, {{had a small}} pilot {{fleet of}} city buses running on <b>compressed</b> <b>hydrogen,</b> and research on powering the nation's fishing fleet with hydrogen is under way. For more practical purposes, Iceland might process imported oil with hydrogen to extend it, rather than to replace it altogether.|$|E

2500|$|... 178m2Hf has {{the highest}} {{excitation}} energy of any comparably long-lived isomer. One gram of pure 178m2Hf contains approximately 1330 megajoules of energy, the equivalent in about 300 kilograms (660 pounds) of the explosive TNT. The half-life of 178m2Hf is 31 years or 1 Gs (gigasecond, 1,000,000,000 seconds) so that a gram's natural radioactivity is 1.6 TBq (terabecquerels) or roughly 40 Ci (curies). The activity is in a cascade of penetrating gamma rays, the most energetic of which is 0.574 MeV. Substantial shielding would be needed for human safety if the sample were to be 1 gram of the pure isomer. However, so far the nuclear isomer exists only at low concentrations (<0.1%), within multi-isotopic hafnium. One gram of this material has about 1.33 megajoules of energy, about {{an order of magnitude}} better than <b>compressed</b> <b>hydrogen.</b>|$|E
25|$|M101 is {{asymmetrical}} due to {{the tidal}} forces from interactions with its companion galaxies. These gravitational interactions <b>compress</b> interstellar <b>hydrogen</b> gas, which then triggers strong star formation activity in M101's spiral arms that can be detected in ultraviolet images.|$|R
40|$|Study of {{the effects}} of {{pressure}} on macromolecular structure improves our understanding of the forces governing structure, provides details on the relevance of cavities and packing in structure, increases our understanding of hydration and provides a basis to understand the biology of high-pressure organisms. A study of DNA, in particular, helps us to understand how pressure can affect gene activity. Here we present the first high-resolution experimental study of B-DNA structure at high pressure, using NMR data acquired at pressures up to 200 MPa (2 kbar). The structure of DNA compresses very little, but is distorted so as to widen the minor groove, and to <b>compress</b> <b>hydrogen</b> bonds, with AT pairs compressing more than GC pairs. The minor groove changes are suggested to lead to a compression of the hydration water in the minor groove...|$|R
50|$|The car {{is powered}} by a Ballard 902 fuel cell. The fuel cell <b>compresses</b> <b>hydrogen</b> in its 5,000 PSI tank and creates {{electricity}} when the hydrogen is separated into protons and electrons. The car itself {{is powered by}} two sources: one source is from the fuel cell itself and the second is from the car's battery pack. It is considered a hybrid because it is powered by two different sources. The car's only byproduct is water which, is made when the hydrogen from the fuel cell contacts the oxygen from outside. It has a top speed of 80 MPH and a driving range of 150 to 200 miles. Ford has delivered about 30 different cars to various cities within the United States, Germany and Canada. It is a zero emissions vehicle.|$|R
2500|$|It is also {{important}} to take losses due to fuel production, transportation, and storage into account. Fuel cell vehicles running on <b>compressed</b> <b>hydrogen</b> may have a power-plant-to-wheel efficiency of 22% if the hydrogen is stored as high-pressure gas, and 17% if it is stored as liquid hydrogen. Fuel cells cannot store energy like a battery, except as hydrogen, but in some applications, such as stand-alone power plants based on discontinuous sources such as solar or wind power, they are combined with electrolyzers and storage systems to form an energy storage system. Most hydrogen, however, is produced by steam methane reforming, and so most hydrogen production emits carbon dioxide. The overall efficiency (electricity to hydrogen and back to electricity) of such plants (known as round-trip efficiency), using pure hydrogen and pure oxygen can be [...] "from 35 up to 50 percent", depending on gas density and other conditions. While a much cheaper lead–acid battery might return about 90%, the electrolyzer/fuel cell system can store indefinite quantities of hydrogen, and is therefore better suited for long-term storage.|$|E
2500|$|In 1939, British {{engineer}} Francis Thomas Bacon successfully {{developed a}} 5kW stationary fuel cell. In 1955, W. Thomas Grubb, a chemist {{working for the}} General Electric Company (GE), further modified the original fuel cell design by using a sulphonated polystyrene ion-exchange membrane as the electrolyte. Three years later another GE chemist, Leonard Niedrach, devised a way of depositing platinum onto the membrane, which served as catalyst for the necessary hydrogen oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions. This {{became known as the}} [...] "Grubb-Niedrach fuel cell". GE went on to develop this technology with NASA and McDonnell Aircraft, leading to its use during Project Gemini. This was the first commercial use of a fuel cell. In 1959, a team led by Harry Ihrig built a 15kW fuel cell tractor for Allis-Chalmers, which was demonstrated across the U.S. at state fairs. This system used potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte and <b>compressed</b> <b>hydrogen</b> and oxygen as the reactants. Later in 1959, Bacon and his colleagues demonstrated a practical five-kilowatt unit capable of powering a welding machine. In the 1960s, Pratt and Whitney licensed Bacon's U.S. patents for use in the U.S. space program to supply electricity and drinking water (hydrogen and oxygen being readily available from the spacecraft tanks). In 1991, the first hydrogen fuel cell automobile was developed by Roger Billings.|$|E
