5000|$|... the {{acceptance}} of family planning services by rural communities in response to maternal and early <b>child</b> <b>care</b> <b>service</b> packages. Main providers of health care were Lady Health Visitors (LHVs) and Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) resident {{in each of the}} study villages in the nutrition- and population studies, respectively. All had received a six-week training prior to onset of the program, followed by monthly reviews, re-training and feed-back on service aspects specific to their group of villages. Input services in the Nutrition villages originally consisted of “feeding centres” and health care for under-5s, and on maternal and newborn health care services in the population cells. Early in 1971, results from the nutrition villages showed no significant decrease in child mortality, and causes and circumstances of child deaths had remained largely unknown. In response, an information system was established, wherein all child deaths in the villages had to be reported to the Narangwal Project Office by the resident health worker within five days. One of the project physicians then went to the concerned family and through intense questioning of close relatives as to the signs and symptoms of the process leading to death, review of the child’s health records, supplemented by visits to the external health care provider if such was the case, established possible reasons for, and a most likely cause of death. Using this method and following an analysis of the initial 45 deaths, diarrheal disease, lower respiratory tract infections and malnutrition were identified as the three principal causes among the 8 days to 3 year old children. Among the 45, one had died from neonatal tetanus. Shortly thereafter, the same process was extended to all villages of the two projects featuring childcare as one of the service inputs. In response to the results, intervention methodologies specific to identified health care priorities were elaborated and introduced in both projects. In 1972, results from the investigation were presented for 124 child deaths during the first seven days of life, and 117 deaths from 8 days to 5 years of age at a conference in Srinagar, Kashmir. The term Verbal Autopsy was used ‘in irony’ by a visiting medical dignitary who not only questioned the results but also the method, labelling it ”unscientific”. The term was retained by the then director of the two projects, Carl E. Taylor, chairman of the Department of International Health who also chaired the conference. Through introduction of specific service packages specifically for the control of DD, ARI, and Neonatal Tetanus, child mortality dropped significantly in the study villages of both the Nutrition and Population projects.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{shows how}} {{fertility}} is determined {{in a model}} that assumes the existence of <b>child</b> <b>care</b> <b>services.</b> When <b>child</b> <b>care</b> <b>services</b> exist, two stable multiple equilibria result: One is a stable, steady state that brings about low fertility with low labor participation; the other, a stable state that brings about high fertility with high labor participation. Moreover, this paper also analyzes the effects of <b>child</b> <b>care</b> policy, for example, the child allowance and expansion of <b>child</b> <b>care</b> <b>services</b> policies. These policies instantaneously pull up fertility. However, the high fertility equilibrium vanishes {{in the case of}} large-scale <b>child</b> <b>care</b> policy. Therefore, there is only a low fertility equilibrium.

40|$|In Switzerland, {{as in many}} {{developed}} countries, {{a growing}} number of parents face a pertinent challenge in trying to reconcile family and work commitments. Parents working full-time or part-time may purchase <b>child</b> <b>care</b> <b>services</b> (such as school-meal and after-school services) provided at school or by other professionals, while others directly provide personal <b>care</b> to their <b>children</b> until school age and reduce their participation to the labor market. Access to <b>child</b> <b>care</b> <b>services</b> represents a key issue and local governments {{play an important role in}} the market for <b>child</b> <b>care</b> <b>services.</b> The availability of <b>child</b> <b>care</b> <b>services</b> is not homogeneous across Swiss cantons and municipalities. Therefore, households may face some constraints in optimizing the allocation of time between work and family. To define effective policies to improve <b>child</b> <b>care</b> <b>services</b> and households choices, governments need information on households’ demand for different types of <b>child</b> <b>care</b> <b>services.</b> The main objective of this thesis is to investigate socioeconomic factors affecting the demand for <b>child</b> <b>care</b> <b>services</b> and households’ willingness to pay for these services. We address these issues by means of three different essays. In the first essay, we analyze preferences of Swiss families for <b>child</b> <b>care</b> facilities. A choice experiment is used to study the effects of the facilities’ characteristics as well as socioeconomic factors on hypothetically-selected <b>child</b> <b>care</b> modes. The experimental data are analyzed using a discrete choice model under different multinomial logit specifications. We correct for the selection bias due to households’ participation in the labor force. The second essay focuses on the demand for school-meals by Swiss families using a stated preferences approach. We collect data from number phone structured interviews. A Poisson model with random-effects is used to explore factors affecting the demand for school- meals. The third study investigates decisions of families living in the City of Lugano about the use of school-meal services and after-school services. Moreover, we analyze the willingness to pay for these services. Data on revealed and stated preferences from 906 households are collected by means of a questionnaire. Factors affecting households’ decisions are explored using Tobit, Heckman and Cragg models, which account for possible sample selection problems...|$|R

30|$|Although {{the decline}} in birth rates will cause many social problems, this crisis could in turn offer an {{opportunity}} for policymakers and stakeholders to reconsider “how to encourage young couples to have children.” Taiwan is now in such a position. In fact, the situation of a declining birthrate has aroused great concern among the Taiwanese authorities. In January 2011, President Ma Ying-jeou publicly expressed the opinion that birthrate related issues have threatened the country in many ways; a declining birthrate crisis has even been contextualized at the level of national security. Thus, he instructed relevant government departments to organize an across-agency team, committed to deliberating upon effective countermeasures.

This initiative was significant on an international scale because the Australian government was the first government to link, through legislation, Quality Assurance Systems for childcare directly to commonwealth funding. So as to provide a legal basis to the link, the Guidelines for Determination of Eligible <b>Child</b> <b>Care</b> Centres (Childcare Assistance) were first tabled in Parliament in October 1993 with an amended version of the Guidelines tabled in December 1993. These Guidelines gave the relevant Minister the power to determine the eligibility of <b>child</b> <b>care</b> centres to receive commonwealth funding. Further legislation to require all approved <b>child</b> <b>care</b> centres, receiving commonwealth funding, to participate in QIAS was introduced in 1999 being, A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999 (Commonwealth).
