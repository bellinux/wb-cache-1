60|$|At {{nine o'clock}} that evening Hodder stood {{alone in the}} arched vestry room, {{and the sight of}} the heavy Gothic chairs ranged about the long table brought up {{memories}} of comfortable, genial meetings prolonged by chat and banter.... The noise of feet, of subdued voices beside the <b>coat</b> <b>room</b> in the corridor, aroused him. All of the vestry would seem to have arrived at once.|$|R

At half-past, his absorption in an evening paper, over the top of which he looked at every newcomer, was almost farcical. At five-and-twenty to nine Pamela arrived. He advanced down the lounge to meet her. Her face was inscrutable, her smile conventional. Yet she had come! He looked over his shoulder towards the men's <b>coat</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Inside the building, {{the main}} {{entrance}} has a white tile floor containing green tiles spelling, [...] "Kirby Center" [...] and green-and-yellow tile wainscoting.

50|$|Ben invites Leslie to a {{cocktail}} party, {{but she is}} intimidated by the numerous beautiful and powerful women that Ben must work with every day and feels that her being elected to city council is feeble compared to their positions of power. Leslie feels so inferior that she barely reacts when meeting two of her idols, Senator Barbara Boxer and Senator Olympia Snowe. She sulks in the <b>coat</b> <b>room</b> and rebuffs words of comfort from a concerned man, not realizing it was Senator John McCain.|$|R

Meanwhile, Jimmy is looking in the <b>coat</b> <b>room</b> for something to steal when Derek catches him. Jimmy tells him what's up and Derek later gives him the money to pay up his dealer.|$|R
50|$|Two {{portrait}}s of Sembrich, one in costume, were painted in 1899 by the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo Müller-Ury (1862-1947) but are now lost. Her 1936 portrait by Alice Ruggles Sohier (1880-1969) now {{hangs in the}} Metropolitan Opera House (and can be found near the <b>coat</b> <b>room).</b> She also {{made a number of}} acoustic recordings prior to World War 1 for both Columbia Records (1903) and the Victor Talking Machine Company. Although these fail to do justice to her voice and undoubted artistry, they have been reissued on CD and repay careful listening.|$|R

5|$|The {{interior}} of the 1883 room has been restored to its original appearance. The red oak floor is trimmed by nine inches of mop board and quarter-round, decoratively accented. The two curved and semi-circular front walls mark the two <b>coat</b> <b>rooms</b> in the original, one-room building. The rounded walls hold a chair rail and are wainscoted below the blackboards.

50|$|The Fife Lake Schoolhouse is a one-story Late Victorian balloon-frame {{rectangular}} {{structure with}} a gable roof and clapboard siding. The exterior is generally plain, but the appearance {{is enhanced by}} a distinctive triple-bay entry porch with a barrel-vault-top center, and by an open well-house-like belfry. Both the porch and the belfry have stickwork brackets, and the belfry has a gable roof and a central finial. Two entrances lead from the porch into <b>coat</b> <b>rooms,</b> which open onto the main schoolroom. The schoolroom has vertical-board interior paneling and a pressed metal ceiling. A clapboard woodshed with a gable roof is located behind the schoolhouse.|$|R

A student posed with the female teacher on the left along with two mothers and a father. The large wooden structure provided space for two classrooms, an entry way and a <b>coat</b> <b>room.</b> The building was heated by a wood or coal burning stove. The bell tower and flag pole can be seen atop the school. A small wooden 2 ̆ 2 outhouse 2 ̆ 2 behind the school was a necessary facility.

Eventually Annie and Shirley realise Abed is on two dates, for which he apologises. After deciding which of the dates to continue exclusively, he realises that he has more in common and more fun with Rachel, but she has already left the dance.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, the {{congregation}} voted to accept updated bylaws of which provided a major revision in their structure that {{did away with}} having committees. With the new leadership structure, ministry would be fulfilled by ministry teams each led by a director. Inspired by the words of 1st Peter 2:5, members wrote their names on stones which were poured into {{the foundation of a}} 17500 sq ft addition to the building consisting of new classrooms, a youth room, a choir room, a family life center, restrooms with shower facilities, a welcome area, a <b>coat</b> <b>room,</b> parlor and a new administrative wing, which was dedicated on June 3, 2007.|$|R
50|$|Inside {{the church}} {{entrance}} {{is a small}} vestibule, along with a cry room and restroom (converted from a former <b>coat</b> <b>room),</b> beyond which is {{the entrance to the}} nave. The nave has two rows of eight oak pews with a center aisle. In the front are the chancel, altar, and pulpit, which are flanked by the pastor's dressing room, and another vestibule leading to a rear exit. A balcony is {{in the rear of the}} church. The original wood floor is covered with carpeting. Perhaps the most unusual aspect of the interior is the altar painting, Crucifixion, by Sarah Kirkeberg Raugland, which is attached to the rear wall of the chancel.|$|R
500|$|This building, {{at least}} among schoolhouses from the time period (1880s), is architecturally unique in two ways. One feature that sets this {{structure}} apart from most rural schoolhouses {{of the day is}} the building's design. Chana School started off as a simple, run-of-the-mill, one-room schoolhouse. Ten years later, however, an addition to the building attached a second, smaller classroom, perpendicular to the original. The bell tower was then constructed to connect the two rooms. The result was a unique layout resembling an [...] "L" [...] with its corner shaved off. Inside the building is another unique feature for schoolhouses of the time—the <b>coat</b> <b>rooms</b> are surrounded by two semi-circular front walls in the original wing of the [...] building.|$|R
50|$|One of Birns's {{most serious}} arrests {{was for the}} 1934 murder of Rudy Duncan, a 36-year-old night club bouncer at Euclid Avenue's Keystone Club. Birns was sitting at Keystone {{with two of his}} fellow gang members when he rose to {{retrieve}} some cigars from his overcoat which he had checked in the <b>coat</b> <b>room.</b> Birns had misplaced his cheque and could not produce it when asked for it by the coatroom girl. The coatroom girl subsequently refused to give Birns access to his coat. Over her objections, Birns entered the coatroom, shoving her aside in the process, and retrieved some cigars from his coat. He then returned to the table, had two more drinks, and smoked one cigar.|$|R

5000|$|The Channel had a legal {{capacity}} of 1,700, although management often oversold the venue for major acts. Upon entering the club, the patron faced a large raised wooden corral {{that provided a}} view of the stage from the far end. The look of the venue was that of the classic roadhouse. The 4' high stage faced a 20' square sunken dance floor, nicknamed [...] "the pit", which was surrounded by drink rails and tables with padded stools. For punk rock and metal shows, the management locked this furniture up in the <b>coat</b> <b>room.</b> When the bands were playing and the crowd was jumping, the entire wooden floor often bounced up and down, causing the 15' high PA system, to sway precariously back and forth.|$|R
