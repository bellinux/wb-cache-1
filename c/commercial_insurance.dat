2500|$|Besides the {{argument}} {{over whether the}} returns on Social Security contributions should or {{can be compared to}} returns on private investment instruments, {{there is the question of}} whether the contributions are nonetheless analogous to pooled insurance premiums charged by for-profit <b>commercial</b> <b>insurance</b> companies to maintain and generate a return on a [...] "risk pool of funds". Like any insurance program, Social Security [...] "spreads risk" [...] as the program protects workers and covered family members against loss of income from the wage earner's retirement, disability, or death. For example, a worker who becomes disabled at a young age could receive a large return relative to the amount they contributed in FICA before becoming disabled, since disability benefits can continue for life. As in private insurance plans, everyone in the particular insurance pool is insured against the same risks, but not everyone will benefit to the same extent.|$|E

2500|$|Amish church {{membership}} {{begins with}} baptism, usually {{between the ages}} of 16 and 25. It is a requirement for marriage within the Amish church. Once a person is baptized with the church, he or she may marry only within the faith. [...] Church districts average between 20 and 40 families, and worship services are held every other Sunday in a member's home. The district is led by a bishop and several ministers and deacons. [...] The rules of the church, the Ordnung, must be observed by every member and cover most aspects of day-to-day living, including prohibitions or limitations on the use of power-line electricity, telephones, and automobiles, as well as regulations on clothing. [...] Most Amish do not buy <b>commercial</b> <b>insurance</b> or participate in Social Security. [...] As present-day Anabaptists, Amish church members practice nonresistance and will not perform any type of military service. The Amish value rural life, manual labor and humility, all under the auspices of living what they interpret to be God's word.|$|E
