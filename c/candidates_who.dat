50|$|Repeated balloting {{allows a}} dark horse or {{compromise}} <b>candidate,</b> <b>who</b> received few {{votes in the}} first round, to become the candidate that opposing factions agree to settle on. Moreover, it can prevent a <b>candidate</b> <b>who</b> is opposed {{by the majority of}} the electorate from being elected, as might happen under plurality.|$|R

5|$|By the 18th century, {{four types}} of {{midshipman}} existed: midshipman (original rating), midshipman extraordinary, midshipman (apprentice officer), and midshipman ordinary. Some midshipmen were older men, and while most were officer <b>candidates</b> <b>who</b> failed to pass the lieutenant examination or were passed over for promotion, {{some members of the}} original rating served, as late as 1822, alongside apprentice officers without themselves aspiring to a commission. By 1794, all midshipmen were considered officer candidates, and the original rating was phased out.|$|E

5|$|Eleanor Rathbone led {{the society}} as its {{secretary}} from 1897, especially in campaigning in the 1910 elections. Three campaign shops were opened around Liverpool, asking men {{to vote for}} <b>candidates</b> <b>who</b> supported votes for women, especially Alexander Gordon Cameron. In 1911, Rathbone and Stewart-Brown set up {{a branch of the}} society to educate women who would soon get the vote. When the society disagreed with the NUWSS, it merged with the Municipal Women's Association to create the Liverpool Women's Citizens Association in 1919.|$|E
5|$|For {{the role}} of Apu, Ray advertised in {{newspapers}} for boys of ages five to seven. None of the <b>candidates</b> <b>who</b> auditioned fulfilled Ray's expectations, but his wife spotted a boy in their neighbourhood, and this boy, Subir Banerjee, was cast as Apu. (The surname {{of three of the}} main actors happened to be Banerjee, but they were not related to each other). The hardest role to fill was the wizened old Indir. Ray eventually found Chunibala Devi, a retired stage actress living in one of Calcutta's red-light districts, as the ideal candidate. Several minor roles were played by the villagers of Boral, where Pather Panchali was filmed.|$|E
5|$|Houston City Council District J now covers Gulfton. District J {{was created}} in 2011 to allow Hispanic voters to more easily select <b>candidates</b> <b>who</b> cater to them. Robert Jara, a {{political}} consultant of the group Campaign Strategies, drew the boundaries of District J {{in order to ensure}} that Gulfton and Sharpstown were together in one area. That way, the Hispanic residents could lobby for influence with their city council representative, whether he or she is of Hispanic origin or not.|$|E

5|$|In 1887 Stanford was {{appointed}} {{professor of music}} at Cambridge in succession to Sir George Macfarren who died in October of that year. Up to this time, the university had awarded music degrees to <b>candidates</b> <b>who</b> had not been undergraduates at Cambridge; all that was required was to pass the university's music examinations. Stanford was determined to end the practice, and after six years he persuaded the university authorities to agree. Three years' study at the university became a prerequisite for sitting the bachelor of music examinations.|$|E
5|$|In February 2012 the Standards in Public Office Commission {{published}} the candidates' returns for campaign donations and election expenses. <b>Candidates</b> <b>who</b> receive more than 25% of a quota (i.e. 12.5% {{of the total}} votes; 221,471 votes) at any stage {{are entitled to a}} refund of election expenses to a maximum of €200,000. Three candidates received the maximum refund allowed; the other four had too few votes and received no refund. Only donations above €638 need be reported, making the reported totals less meaningful. Gay Mitchell had stated his campaign would be funded by a Fine Gael members' lottery.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Cumberland Presbytery, also {{within the}} Kentucky Synod, faced a {{shortage}} of ministers and decided to license clergy <b>candidates</b> <b>who</b> were less educated than was typical and who could not subscribe completely to the Westminster Confession. In 1805, the synod suspended many of these ministers, even bringing heresy charges against a number of them, and by 1806 the synod had dissolved the presbytery. In 1810, ministers dissatisfied with {{the actions of the}} synod formed the Cumberland Presbyterian Church (CPC). The CPC subscribed to a modified form of the Westminster Confession that rejected the Calvinist doctrines of double predestination and limited atonement.|$|E

5000|$|The {{strategy}} was {{highly dependent on}} Littlefield having persuaded LePage {{to talk about his}} life story of overcoming adversity, which became major campaign themes. John Morris, LePage's campaign chief of staff, credits Littlefield for sharpening the campaign's focus and coming up with what he referred to as the [...] "three onlys" [...] theme before the Republican primary in June. [...] "Paul was the only <b>candidate</b> <b>who</b> had a compelling life story. Paul was the only <b>candidate</b> <b>who</b> had a successful experience as a chief executive officer of a government entity. And Paul was the only <b>candidate</b> <b>who</b> was the executive of a prosperous Maine business," [...] Morris said.|$|R
