Nirex’s response to this remit (which largely consists of transuranic waste) has been to develop the Nirex Phased Disposal Concept: a long-term management solution based on phased deep geological disposal within a cementitious repository. One means of achieving a more integrated approach to waste management is the combined disposal (<b>co-disposal)</b> of high level waste and spent fuel (HLW/SF) with solid ILW/LLW within a single facility.

40|$|Landfill {{leachate}} {{is generated}} {{as a result}} of reactions between water percolating through the landfill and wastes. Under normal conditions leachate is found at the bottom of landfills and from there, its movement can be controlled with collection systems to be treated, discharged, or recirculated. Landfill leachate collection systems are positioned above the liner and are designed to collect liquid under gravitational flow for the entire active, closure, and post-closure periods. Clogging of any portion of the system can lead to higher hydraulic heads and increase the potential for leakage through the liner. To reduce the quantity of municipal solid wastes (MSW) requiring landfilling, many municipalities have adopted waste-to-energy (WTE) facilities that yield energy in the form of combustible gases and noncombustible residues. Disposal practices for WTE residuals include landfilling in monofills or <b>co-disposal</b> with MSW and other materials such as residues from water and wastewater treatment facilities.

It is ill reality the only structure on the mine, together with mine waste dumps, that has to "last forever" after the mining operation ceases. While the normal method of tailings disposal into a TSF is well understood and widely practiced, the alternative methods available using <b>co-disposal</b> may provide significant advantages for mining operations with particular issues or problems.

40|$|Abstract: The <b>co-disposal</b> of dewatered {{sewage sludge}} and {{municipal}} solid waste may cause significant impacts (such as total and differential settlement, slope stability of the waste, and leachability) on landfill operations and the subsurface environment. The objectives {{of this study were}} to investigate the <b>co-disposal</b> of dewatered sewage sludge and {{municipal solid waste}} with respect to their consolidation characteristics, vane shear strength, and leachability. The results of the consolidation tests show that, for a given stress increment, the deformation (the change in the void ratio) of the dewatered sewage sludge is larger than the deformation of its sludge mixtures. When the sludge ratio in the mixture increases, the compressibility of the mixture increases. The total consolidation settlement taking place in landfilling of dewatered sewage sludge alone would be much greater than that for <b>co-disposal</b> of sludge with solid waste. The results of the shear stress strength tests of the sludge and its mixtures imply that side slopes of 20 º can probably be constructed in a landfill site without causing a sliding problem.

These filtrates were then analysed by XRF spectrometry for quantitative determination of SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3. The [SiO 2]/[Al 2 O 3] ratio obtained in the filtrates range from 1. 4 to 2. 5.

40|$|The {{profiles}} of beaches {{formed by the}} hydraulic deposition of mine wastes from a pipeline are important {{in the design of}} mine waste impoundments. However, there is at present no satisfactory method of predicting the slopes of such beaches. In this paper, the compatibility with the available quantitative hydraulic data of the assumptions incorporated in existing models of deposition on mine waste beaches is explored. The available quantitative data show that flows on mine waste beaches may be laminar or turbulent and subcritical, but none support the occurrence of supercritical flows. Nevertheless the possibility that such flows occur cannot be discounted.

40|$|Current {{options for}} {{managing}} wastewater biosolids in the United States include both beneficial reuse technologies (such as land application, landfilling with biogas recovery, and energy recovery through incineration) and non-reuse options, including landfilling. While implementing {{some type of}} beneficial reuse is the preferred method for managing wastewater biosolids, {{this is not always}} practical. For example, land acquisition constraints or poor material quality may limit beneficial reuse options. In these situations, landfilling of biosolids may be a viable alternative. Biosolids landfilling options include disposal in a monofill (a landfill that accepts only wastewater treatment plant biosolids), or in a <b>co-disposal</b> landfill (a landfill that combines biosolids with municipal solid waste). Although <b>co-disposal</b> landfilling is more common than monofilling, biosolids typically represent {{only a small percentage of}} the total waste in a <b>co-disposal</b> landfill (WEF, 1998). Landfill disposal of biosolids should not be confused with use of biosolids to amend final cover material at landfills. This practice is a form of land application in which biosolids are added to soil to enhance conditions for growing cover vegetation. The EPA fact sheet Land Application of Biosolids addresses the use of biosolids in rehabilitating disturbed lands. common methods of monofilling wastewater biosolids are the trench, area, and ramp methods. Trench monofilling (Figure 1) involves excavating a trench, placing the biosolids in the trench, and then backfilling the trench to return the soil to its original contours. Monofill trenches can be narrow or wide, depending on the solids concentrations of the biosolids to be filled. Narrow trenches (typically less than 3 m [approximately 10 ft] wide) are generally used for disposal of biosolids with a low solids content. Wide trenches (typically greater than 3 m [approximately 10 ft] wide) are used for disposal of biosolids with a solids content of 20 percent or more. If the biosolids contain less than 20 percent solids, they will not support the machinery used to place the cover material over the trench. Application rates for trenches less than 3 m in width are approximately 2, 270 - 10, 580 m 3 /h...|$|E

40|$|Waste rocks (WRs) {{from coal}} mining and fly ash (FA) from coal {{combustion}} were studied {{to determine the}} potential of the WRs to generate AMD, FAs to neutralise it and estimate their impacts on environment. The ultimate goal was to develop a methodology based on <b>co-disposal</b> to mitigate the environmental problems associated to both wastes. Two methods for <b>co-disposal</b> were tested: i) Mixing WRs and FAs and ii) covering WRs with FAs. WRs were sampled from the Lakhra coal mines in Pakistan (PK), which has an estimated coal reserves of 1. 3 Btonne, varying from lignite to sub-bituminous quality. The FA was sampled from a power plant utilising coal from Lakhra coal mines and is situated in close vicinity (15 km) of the mine site. For comparative purposes a bituminous FA from Finland (FI) and biomass FA from Sweden (SE) were also characterised. The WRs and FA samples were characterised by mineralogical and geochemical methods. Besides organic material (coal traces), quartz, pyrite, kaolinite, hematite, gypsum and traces of calcite, lime, malladerite, spangolite, franklinite and birnessite were identified in WRs by XRD. The major elements Si, Al, Ca and Fe were in the range (wt. %) of 8 – 12, 6 – 9, 0. 3 – 3 and 1 – 10, respectively, with high S concentrations (1. 94 – 11. 33 wt. %) in WRs. The AMD potential of WRs ranged from - 70 to - 492 kg CaCO 3 tonne- 1. All FAs contained quartz, with iron oxide, anhydrite and magnesioferrite in PK, mullite and lime in FI and calcite and anorthite in SE. The Ca content in SE was 6 and 8 times higher compared to PK and FI, respectively. FAs were enriched in As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn compared to continental crust. The acid neutralising potential of PK was equivalent to 20 kg CaCO 3 tonne- 1 compared to 275 kg CaCO 3 tonne- 1 (SE) and 25 kg CaCO 3 tonne- 1 (FI). During the period of 192 days in weathering cell experiments (WCE), the pH of leachates from most acidic WRs was maintained from 1 to 2. 5, whereas, the less acidic WRs produced leachates of mildly acidic (2. 7) to neutral (7. 3) pH. The leachates from very acidic WRs ranged in the concentrations of Fe, SO 24 − and Al from mg L- 1 to g L- 1. The samples were subjected to column leaching experiments (CLE) in which mixture (FA:WR; 1 : 3) and cover (FA:WR; 1 : 5) cases were mimicked (with 10 mm particle size) and effects of particle size (2, 5 and 10 mm) on element leaching were studied. Despite having the lowest acid-neutralisation potential compared to FI and SE, <b>co-disposal</b> of PKFA as mixture readily provides acid buffering minerals, resulting in better start-up pH conditions and leachate quality. However, acidity produced by secondary mineralisation contributes towards the acidification of the system, causing stabilisation of pH at around 4. 5 − 5. Secondary mineralisation (especially Fe- and Al-mineral precipitation) also removes toxic elements such as As, Pb, Cu, Zn, Cd, Co, Ni and Mn, and these secondary minerals can also buffer acidity when the pH tends to be acidic. In contrast, the pH of the leachates from the PKFA cover scenario gradually increased from strongly acidic to mildly acidic and circumneutral along with decrease in EC and elemental leaching in different WRs. Gradually increasing pH {{can be attributed to the}} cover effect, which reduces oxygen ingress, thus sulphide oxidation, causing pH to elevate. Due to the fact that pH~ 4 – 5 is sufficient for secondary Fe- and Al-mineral precipitation which also removes toxic elements (such as Cd, Co, Cu, Zn and Ni) by adsorption and/or co-precipitation, the FA cover performs well enough to achieve that pH until the conclusion of the CLE. However, due to the slower reactivity of the buffering system (additional to the initial flush-out), leaching in the beginning could not be restricted. The <b>co-disposal</b> of FA as cover and/or mixture possesses potential for neutralisation of AMD and improving leachate quality significantly. Particle size of the WRs affected the leaching of the sulphide related elements (such as Fe, S, Zn, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn and Ni) in CLE and WCE. Experiments with ≤ 1 mm particle size constantly produced acidic and metal laden leachates. <b>Co-disposal</b> of FA and WRs as cover and mixture need to be investigated on pilot-scales before full-scale application...|$|E

A mine tailing paste sample from Zaruma, Ecuador was subjected to different types of leaching tests, analyzing the influence of pH, grain size, L/S ratio and time on As release. Despite elevated total concentrations (541 mg/kg), As showed low solubility, and the release in different leaching tests was very low, even at extreme pH values (pH 2 and 11). Since pyrite in this sample showed low reactivity, the risk of acid mine drainage is limited. The release of As from the tailing material under changing environmental conditions (e. g. <b>co-disposal</b> with acid or alkaline waste) is not of particular concern, but dispersal of fine particles by water erosion should be avoided. status: publishe...|$|E
