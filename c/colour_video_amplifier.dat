40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a new robust watermarking algorithm devoted to <b>colour</b> <b>video</b> protection. This algorithm is developed out of generalising and adapting the principles we derived for still image sequences. The mark {{consists of a}} 64 bit message modulated {{by means of a}} spread spectrum technique and is embedded into the 2 D-DCT hierarchy. The right room for the mark to be embedded into this hierarchy was established according to our previous study on statistical video modelling. The method thus obtained features robustness (against the general attacks, Stirmark included), transparency (fidelity and quality) and low probability of false alarm (lower than − 16 − 14 2 × 10 ≅ 16). The experimental data consist of 100 <b>colour</b> <b>video</b> sequences of about 40 s each...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} a method designed to analyse {{the distribution of}} the 2 D-DCT (bi-Dimensional Discrete Cosine Transform) coefficient hierarchy computed over three types of image sequences: <b>colour</b> <b>video,</b> grey-level X-ray CT (computerised tomography) images and computer simulated noise images. This method is a statistical approach which combines in a new way the following four tests: (1) the 2 χ (Chi-square) test on concordance between experimental data and a theoretical probability density function, (2) the ρ (Ro) test on correlation, (3) the Fisher F test on equality between two variances, and (4) the Student T test on equality between two means. Such an approach was compulsory so as to mathematically overcome the dependency existing among successive images in the considered sequences. The results obtained on natural sequences (either video or medical images) are compared to those corresponding to computer simulated sequences, interesting differences being pointed out and discussed. The overall results may {{play a central role in}} a large variety of image/video processing applications: compression, segmentation, retrieval, protection (e. g. cryptography and watermarking). For instance, we successfully applied them to the design of a new robust watermarking method for <b>colour</b> <b>video.</b> Key words: 2 D-DCT coefficient hierarchy, statistical analysis, <b>colour</b> <b>video,</b> X-ray CT medical images, computer simulated noise images. 1...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a multi-view video coding method via {{generation}} of virtual picture sequences is proposed.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{application}} of the combined video quality assessment method as well as some other recently developed objective metrics for the analysis {{of the results of the}} nonlinear <b>colour</b> <b>video</b> filtering is discussed. The spatio-temporal versions of colour image filtering methods, including the Vector Median Filter, can be obtained using frame-by-frame approach but the proper choice of the spatio-temporal kernel weights and the colour space used during filtration should be based on a reliable video quality assessment. In some earlier papers the combined video quality assessment method has been proposed, which has a highly linear correlation with subjective quality scores and can be extended into the colour version. As the illustration of the problem, some results of the <b>colour</b> <b>video</b> denoising using the spatio-temporal VMF, also in a weighted version, together with the quality assessment results have been presented in the paper. 1...|$|R
