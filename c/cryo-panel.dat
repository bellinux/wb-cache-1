40|$|Beijing Radioactive Ion-beam Facility (BRIF) {{is being}} built at China Institute of Atomic Energy (CIAE). As a driving {{accelerator}} for ion beam production, CYCIAE- 100 will provide proton beam of 75 MeV～ 100 MeV with an intensity of 200 μA～ 500 μA. At present, the design for each system has been accomplished and an overall {{progress has been made}} for the CYCIAE- 100 project. The manufacture of the main magnet has entered into the final assembly stage. Two main magnet coils have been completed, two 100 kW RF amplifiers are tested with full output power, the main vacuum chamber and main magnet lift system will be completed soon. The construction designs and suppliers surveys for other systems are finished and ready for purchase. Some key design and technology experiments are in process and significant results have been achieved in verifications. The “Central Region Model Test Stand for High Intensity Cyclotron Development” (CYCIAE-CRM) has successfully passed the formal certification held by the competent authorities. A full scale experimental RF cavity has been fabricated, on which the frequency and Q value measured coincide well with the numerically calculation. The verification test of vacuum <b>cryo-panel</b> structure has provided valuable information to <b>cryo-panel</b> structure design. The key technical problems related to CYCIAE- 100 project are being solved along with the progress. IMP;Chinese Academy of Science...|$|E
40|$|The {{divertor}} and the {{pumping system}} of Wendelstein 7 -X {{is designed for}} stationary operation at various modes of operation. Maximum fluxes up to 10 ²⁴ electron–ion-pairs/s are expected at the targets. Various cases of plasma–wall interaction have to be considered: at low densities convective power losses and proceeding to higher densities a high recycling mode, including detachment dominated by radiation. External fluxes (NBI, gas puffing and pellet injection) up to 10 ²² particles/s have to be pumped. The geometry of the target plates, the installation of additional baffle plates and {{the position of the}} pumping gap were optimised on the basis of numerical studies with the 3 D neutral particle code EIRENE. For particle exhaust turbomolecular pumps (TMPs) and <b>cryo-panels</b> will be installed. Taking in account the capabilities of the TMP in the magnetic stray field an effective pumping speed for H₂ of 4200 l/s at one divertor box will be reached. Including the <b>cryo-panels</b> integrated inside the divertor boxes a total pumping speed of up to 200 000 l/s will be provided...|$|R
40|$|NASA s Space Environment Simulation Laboratory s (SESL) Chamber A, {{located at}} the Johnson Space Center in Houston Texas has {{recently}} implemented major enhancements of its cryogenic and vacuum systems. The new liquid nitrogen (LN) thermo-siphon system was successfully commissioned in August of 2012. Chamber A, which has 20 K helium <b>cryo-panels</b> (or shrouds) which are shielded by 80 K nitrogen shrouds, is capable of simulating a deep space environment necessary to perform ground testing of NASA s James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Chamber A s previous system used forced flow LN cooling with centrifugal pumps, requiring 220, 000 liters of LN to cool-down and consuming 180, 000 liters per day of LN in steady operation. The LN system {{did not have the}} reliability required to meet the long duration test of the JWST, and the cost estimate provided in the initial approach to NASA-JSC by the subcontractor for refurbishment of the system to meet the reliability goals was prohibitive. At NASA-JSC s request, the JLab Cryogenics Group provided alternative options in 2007, including a thermo-siphon, or natural flow system. This system, eliminated the need for pumps and used one tenth of the original control valves, relief valves, and burst disks. After the thermo-siphon approach was selected, JLab provided technical assistance in the process design, mechanical design, component specification development and commissioning oversight, while the installation and commissioning operations of the system was overseen by the Jacobs Technology/ESC group at JSC. The preliminary commissioning data indicate lower shroud temperatures, 68, 000 liters to cool-down and less than 91, 000 liters per day consumed in steady operation. All of the performance capabilities have exceeded the design goals. This paper will outline the comparison between the original system and the predicted results of the selected design option, and the commissioning results of thermo-siphon system...|$|R
