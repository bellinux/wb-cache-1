5|$|In {{response}} to notification from Air Traffic Control, three ambulances from Perth were despatched {{in the direction}} of the <b>crash</b> <b>site,</b> known to be somewhere between Chidlow and York. The <b>crash</b> <b>site</b> was several miles from the road so the ambulance crews travelled eastwards all the way to York without sighting a fire. The crews were eventually guided back along the main road and then along a dirt road that enabled them to drive to within three or four miles of the <b>crash</b> <b>site.</b> The crews then took their first-aid boxes and set out on foot.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) based methodology to identify high pedestrian <b>crash</b> <b>sites</b> and then select safety countermeasures based on causal factors. The methodology to select high <b>crash</b> <b>sites</b> includes identifying the problem area, the high risk zones {{and then the}} high <b>crash</b> <b>sites.</b> Two types of crash indices were used to rank high risk zones. They {{are based on the}} number of pedestrian crashes in the vicinity of the zone by severity and length of the zone. Results obtained by applying the methodology in the Las Vegas metropolitan area are discussed...|$|R

5|$|The Brazilian Air Force sent five {{fixed-wing}} aircraft and three helicopters {{to the region}} for an extensive search and rescue (SAR) operation. As many as 200 personnel were reported {{to be involved in}} the operation, among them a group of Kayapo people familiar with the forest. The <b>crash</b> <b>site</b> of Gol Flight 1907 was spotted on 30September by the BAF, at coordinates , 200km (120mi) east of Peixoto de Azevedo, near Fazenda Jarinã, a cattle ranch. It was reported that rescue personnel had difficulty reaching the <b>crash</b> <b>site</b> due to the dense forest.|$|E
5|$|The {{stricken}} airliner crashed onto Mount Bliss in the San Gabriel Mountains at {{an elevation}} of approximately , where {{the bulk of the}} wreckage landed in a gorge. Fire department officials sent search and rescue helicopters to the <b>crash</b> <b>site,</b> but efforts were hampered by thick fog. Nine bodies were initially found at the <b>crash</b> <b>site,</b> a number of them intact and still strapped into their seats. News reports indicated that these bodies had apparently been thrown clear on impact, and had come to rest alongside the tail section of the aircraft.|$|E

5000|$|CAHS' {{flagship}} {{program is}} the Aviation Archaeology (AvAr) Program. [...] The Program was designed in 2005 and its inaugural class was held in 2006. The rudiments of aviation archaeology training subjects include prelimenary project research of accident reports, federal/state laws, simple orienteering, site documentation and investigation. Graduate Field Agents visit aircraft <b>crash</b> <b>sites,</b> old missiles facilities, former aircraft manufacturing facilities, abandoned airfields and airstrips. There are over 800 military aircraft <b>crash</b> <b>sites</b> in Colorado.|$|R

5|$|A nearby Citgo {{service station}} also had {{security}} cameras, but a video released on September 15, 2006 {{did not show}} the crash because the camera was pointed away from the <b>crash</b> <b>site.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{temporary}} memorial {{formed from}} spontaneous tributes left by visitors {{in the days}} after the attacks at the <b>crash</b> <b>site.</b> Foundations across the country began to raise money to fund a memorial to the victims within a month of the crash.|$|E
5|$|A {{temporary}} memorial {{was built}} near the <b>crash</b> <b>site</b> {{soon after the}} attacks. Construction of a permanent Flight 93 National Memorial was dedicated on September 10, 2011, and the concrete and glass visitor center situated on a hill overlooking the site was opened exactly four years later.|$|E
5000|$|This game mode shared common threads with [...] "king-of-the-hill" [...] game modes. Players {{operated}} in two teams of four, {{who needed to}} secure and hold meteor <b>crash</b> <b>sites</b> that appeared across the map. These points were captured by standing on the crash zone {{and waiting for the}} capture sequence to complete, taking damage during these capture moments would result in slowed acquisition of the site. During the course of gameplay the <b>crash</b> <b>sites</b> disappeared and respawned at different locations. The winner was the first team to score 1000 points.|$|R

5|$|After {{consulting}} with Deep Throat, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) travels to Townsend and takes {{photos of the}} <b>crash</b> <b>site,</b> only to be captured. After being interrogated by Henderson, Mulder is detained alongside an eccentric NICAP member named Max Fenig (Scott Bellis), who was also captured in the woods. The next morning, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) arrives to retrieve Mulder, telling him that FBI Section Chief Joseph McGrath is threatening {{to shut down the}} X-Files because of his behavior. She also claims that the wreckage has been identified as a downed Libyan fighter jet; Mulder dismisses this explanation. Meanwhile, the invisible occupant of the UFO passes through an electronic fence set up around the <b>crash</b> <b>site,</b> escaping into the outside world.|$|E
5|$|By morning, the UFO <b>crash</b> <b>site</b> {{has been}} sealed {{off by the}} government, who has put out a cover-story that claims a Taco Bell is being built. Douchebag visits Kupa Keep and learns that the Stick has again been stolen by the elves. Cartman and Kyle task Douchebag with {{recruiting}} the Goth kids for their respective sides, each claiming that the other has the Stick. Randy agrees to help Douchebag recruit the Goths after Douchebag infiltrates the <b>crash</b> <b>site</b> and discovers that government agents are plotting {{to blow up the}} town in order to destroy an alien goo released from the ship. The goo turns living creatures into Adolf Hitler-esque Nazi Zombies; an infected person escapes government containment, unleashing the virus on South Park.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, {{he participated}} in Operation Mount Hope III, during which U.S. forces {{recovered}} a crashed Soviet-made Mi-24 Hind attack helicopter in Chad. Company E of the 160th deployed to N'Djamena, Chad via C-5 Galaxy. Once in Chad the company flew two CH-47 Chinooks 490 nautical miles at night, {{without the use of}} navigational aids, to the <b>crash</b> <b>site.</b> Once at the <b>crash</b> <b>site</b> the crews harnessed the crashed Hind to a Chinook via sling-load. During the returning flight both Chinooks performed an air-to-air refuel with a C-130; and later endured a sandstorm before returning with the Hind.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Crash</b> <b>sites</b> vary in {{size and}} content; some may have fuselages, engines, and {{thousands}} of parts and debris. [...] Other sites, like in civilian/commercial crashes, the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) will have {{almost all of the}} aircraft and debris removed; which makes aviation archaeology more challenging. Remains of military aircraft <b>crash</b> <b>sites</b> may also be removed by various aircraft restoration groups, particularly if the aircraft was found largely intact. In general, most recent-day (since the 1980s) aircraft crashes are removed entirely, due to environmental regulations, leaving very little to indicate the existence of a wreck.|$|R
25|$|Aviation history {{sites on}} land {{that can be}} subject to archaeological survey or {{excavation}} can include airports (which can contain hangars, terminal, other facilities, etc.), <b>crash</b> <b>sites,</b> monuments, or even properties associated with important persons or events in aviation history.|$|R

5|$|More than 5,000 Brazilians {{marched to}} the <b>crash</b> <b>site</b> on July 29, 2007, blaming their government's failure to invest in airport {{infrastructure}} for the crash. Many of the protesters also demanded the ousting of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB sent {{a team to}} the <b>crash</b> <b>site</b> to {{investigate}} the accident. They concluded that, unknown to the crew, ice had collected on the wings, which disrupted airflow and reduced lift.The inquiry lasted just under one year.|$|E
25|$|Investigations {{conducted}} at the <b>crash</b> <b>sites</b> indicated {{that for the first}} time, the Tamil Tiger aircraft were packed with explosives, rather than carrying bombs as they had previously done. It was estimated that there were 215kg of C-4 plastic explosives inside each plane.|$|R
50|$|The hills between Kilbirnie and Largs {{were often}} black spots for {{aircraft}} passing over and many crashed due to low fog. The <b>crash</b> <b>sites</b> {{are available to}} visit, with wreckage still visible {{and some of these}} now form part of Clyde Muirshiel Regional Park.|$|R
