25|$|In the UK, many {{companies}} in debt decide {{it is more}} beneficial to start again by creating a new company, {{often referred to as}} a phoenix company. In business terms this will mean liquidating a company as the only option and then resuming under a different name with the same customers, clients and suppliers. In some circumstances it may appear ideal for the directors; however, if they trade under a name which is the same or substantially the same as the <b>company</b> <b>in</b> <b>liquidation</b> without approval from the Court, they will be committing an offence under S216 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (and equivalent legislation in UK regions). Persons participating in the management of the 'phoenix' company may also be held personally liable for the debts of the company under s217 of the Insolvency Act unless the Court approval has been granted.|$|E

50|$|The {{court held}} that a trustee or {{liquidator}} is not privy to the insolvent or to the <b>company</b> <b>in</b> <b>liquidation.</b> He is not bound by any judgment against the insolvent or the company {{to which he was}} not a party, and a plea of res judicata cannot be raised against him in respect of such a judgment because he does not derive his authority from the insolvent or the company; he has an independent right of action under the Insolvency Act.|$|E
5000|$|Although the {{decision}} has never subsequently been doubted, commentators {{were quick to}} point out that [...] "trust" [...] is not used in the strictly technical term, as none of the creditors have any specific interest in the trust property. [...] Other commentators have noted that [...] "it has long been objected that there is no real trust of the property of a <b>company</b> <b>in</b> <b>liquidation</b> and 'trust' should be used only as a convenient way of describing the status of property in a liquidation, not as a categorisation with legal consequences".|$|E

5000|$|There {{is little}} {{difficulty}} when {{the claim is}} that the company either conspired with a second company or {{with at least two}} natural persons. The requisite knowledge can be attributed under either head as appropriate. But there is a problem under the first heading when fraud is involved because there is a clash of authority. Lloyd v Grace, Smith & Co 1912 AC 716 held that a Principal may be liable where the Agent commits a fraud within actual or apparent authority, whereas in In re Hampshire Land Company 1896 2 Ch 743, it was held that the knowledge and, sometimes, the conduct of an Agent acting fraudulently so as to cause loss to the Principal will not be imputed to the Principal. In theory, vicarious liability may be of more assistance in that it is attributing the wrong done by one (natural) person to another (fictitious) but, in Belmont Finance Corporation v Williams Furniture Ltd 1979 Ch 250, the Hampshire Land agency line of authority was preferred. Belmont, a <b>company</b> <b>in</b> <b>liquidation,</b> sued a number of defendants, including the majority of its own directors, for conspiracy to procure Belmont to buy shares in another company at a gross overvalue. The purpose of this plan was to fund the acquisition of shares in Belmont itself by some of the defendants. Foster J. struck out the claim on the basis that Belmont was itself a party to the conspiracy. On appeal, Buckley LJ. said: ...|$|E
