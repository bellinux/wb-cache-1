A carved chimneypiece in the armoury has three roundels <b>carved</b> <b>with</b> the goddesses Minerva, Venus and Juno in medieval attire.|$|E
5|$|Monument 15 {{is a large}} boulder with an Olmec-style relief {{sculpture}} of the head, shoulders and arms of an anthropomorphic figure emerging from a shallow niche, the arms bent inwards at the elbow. The back of the boulder is <b>carved</b> <b>with</b> the hindquarters of a feline, probably a jaguar.|$|E
5|$|Stela 10 {{was found}} in Group 21 {{together}} with Altar 6. They are among the very few monuments that were placed outside of the ceremonial centre of the city. Stela 10 was <b>carved</b> <b>with</b> a frame containing a figure, now badly eroded. The figure is standing with feet separated and turned outwards. Small hieroglyphic panels accompany it. Stela 10 had been moved from its original location, which was probably somewhere nearby.|$|E

5|$|A {{panelled}} stone {{structure in}} the church, <b>carved</b> <b>with</b> processions of bearded and robed figures under arches, seems to reproduce details found in the Book of Cerne, a work associated with Bishop Æthelwold of Lichfield (818–830). The panels, which may originally have been the outer part of a sarcophagus built to hold {{the remains of a}} high status person such as Saint Hardulph, are dated by their similarity to the illustrations in the Book of Cerne to the first third of the ninth century. According to a medieval calendar of saints, the Benedictine monks at Breedon celebrated Hardulph's feast day on 21 August.|$|E
5|$|As of 2006, 304 stone monuments {{have been}} found at Takalik Abaj, mostly carved from local {{andesite}} boulders. Of these monuments 124 are <b>carved</b> <b>with</b> the remainder being plain; they are mostly found in the Central and Western Groups. The worked monuments {{can be divided into}} four broad classifications: Olmec-style sculptures, which represent 21% of the total, Maya-style sculptures representing 42% of the monuments, potbelly monuments (14% of the total) and the local style of sculpture represented by zoomorphs (23% of the total).|$|E
5|$|Crude glyphs {{have been}} found on a few stone objects and some {{additional}} wooden items, {{but most of these}} are thought to be fakes created for the early tourism market. Several of the 26 wooden texts are suspect due to uncertain provenance (X, Y, and Z), poor quality craftsmanship (F, K, V, W, Y, and Z), or to having been <b>carved</b> <b>with</b> a steel blade (K, V, and Y), and thus, although they may prove to be genuine, should not be trusted in initial attempts at decipherment. Z resembles many early forgeries in not being boustrophedon, but it may be a palimpsest on an authentic but now illegible text.|$|E
50|$|Wood is {{carved into}} {{ceremonial}} masks, smoking pipes, chairs known as apyká, and anthropomorphic and zoomorphic effigies. Gourds are also <b>carves</b> <b>with</b> images.|$|R

5|$|Monument 11 {{is located}} in the southwestern area of Terrace3, to the east of Structure8. It is a natural boulder <b>carved</b> <b>with</b> a {{vertical}} series of five hieroglyphs. Further left is a single hieroglyph and the glyphs for the number11. This sculpture is considered to be in an especially early Maya style and dates to {{the first part of the}} Late Preclassic. It is one of a row of 5 monuments running east-west along the southern edge of Terrace3.|$|E
5|$|The second {{cross is}} tall and slender, a free {{standing}} monolith pillar-cross, with a slender rounded shaft (changing to square above) and a free armed head formed by notching the shaft. It is <b>carved</b> <b>with</b> figures in traditional Welsh style. One figure in particular, which looks much like {{the figure of a}} saint, is inscribed low on the north face. The Cross of St Padarn is granophyre and has Celtic interlace in panels down one face. It is uncertainly dated between the ninth and eleventh century. Though not comparable with the great Irish high crosses, it shows sophisticated carving, and willingness to bring the stone from the Mawdddach estuary, Gwynedd.|$|E
5|$|Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret was {{intended}} by Etty {{to illustrate the}} virtues of chastity and honour. It shows the moment in which Busirane is interrupted by Britomart {{as he prepares to}} kill Amoret. Amoret is chained to a gilded Solomonic column, <b>carved</b> <b>with</b> depictions of Venus, and her clothes fall from her shoulders as she struggles. Britomart, clad in armour, enters Busirane's Moorish chamber, and tramples a blood-stained grimoire as she draws her sword. Busirane, naked from the waist up and with Chinese-style trousers and queue, falls to the floor, his blade still pointing at Amoret's heart. Unusually for Etty, Britomart is painted very thinly, with the canvas weave still visible through the paint. Art historian Alison Smith considers that this was likely inspired by Henry Fuseli, who painted a depiction of Britomart using the same style of painting.|$|E
50|$|Behind the altar, in {{a church}} in Saskatchewan, he <b>carved</b> his name <b>with</b> a date. Also, in a parish in Alberta, a similar <b>carving</b> <b>with</b> his name and date were found. He {{travelled}} {{as far north as}} Gimli, serving there at St. Michael's Ukrainian Catholic Church.|$|R

5|$|Early Heian period works {{before the}} mid-10th century appear heavy {{compared}} to Nara period statues, carved from single blocks of wood, and characterised by draperies <b>carved</b> <b>with</b> alternating round and sharply cut folds. Stylistically, they followed high to later Tang style. In the Heian period the zōbussho were replaced with temple-run and independent workshops; wood became the primary medium; and a specific Japanese style emerged. By the mid-10th century, the style was refined presenting a more calm and gentle appearance, with attenuated proportions. Jōchō {{was the most}} important sculptor of this time, and he used the yosegi technique, in which several pieces of wood are joined to sculpt a single figure. He was the ancestor of three important schools of Japanese Buddhist statuary: the , Inpa and Keiha school. The Amida Nyorai at Byōdō-in is the only extant work by Jōchō.|$|E
5|$|It {{is notable}} for a carved roof, with lions {{and a small}} cider barrel purportedly carved by the monks of Muchelney Abbey. Sir John Betjeman was also {{inspired}} by an inscription on the candelabra. The church is quite plain on the outside but inside {{is one of the}} finest wooden carved roofs in the county. It is shallow pitched with massive, richly decorated tie beams and short king posts. The whole area of the roof is divided into square carved panels set in the framework of the structural timbers which are decorated with carved bosses where they intersect. There are 640 panels each <b>carved</b> <b>with</b> the same quatrefoil design. In the triangular spaces above each beam are dragon-like beasts. It is said there are bullet holes in the timbers, caused by soldiers who camped in the church in 1646 before the Battle of Langport. The 17th century pulpit and altar table are Jacobean woodwork. There are five other churches in the town, including Catholic and Methodist groups.|$|E
5|$|Stela 5 was {{situated}} {{at the base of}} Structure 1 in the East Plaza. It was <b>carved</b> <b>with</b> a rounded frame containing a figure in profile facing to the left. The figure is standing with the legs together and is wearing a feathered headdress and bears a zoomorphic head on its back, from which hang more feathers. The hands of the figure are extended forward and appear to bear a staff of rulership. The stela bears a hieroglyphic panel with an incomplete dedicatory date that must fall within the range from December 740 to November 805. The text also contains the name of the king who dedicated the stela, Shield Jaguar, and the Emblem Glyph of El Chal.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} comprises a compact, three-storey house, in the Dutch-classical style {{which was}} introduced into England by Sir Roger Pratt, and {{is typical of}} Bruce's work. The six-bay entrance front has a two-bay projecting central section, surmounted by a pediment topped by three pineapples, of which one remains. The tympanum is <b>carved</b> <b>with</b> the coat of arms of the Earl and his wife, with their initials (WEA and SCA for William, Earl of Annandale, and Sophia Countess of Annandale) and the date 1699. The roof behind was bell-cast, with a cupola and four tall chimneys symmetrically placed, although this was replaced in the 1950s. The centrally placed entrance is reached by steps, and surmounted by carved decorations. The garden front is similar, and is also topped by a decorated pediment. Once the house was complete, two wings connected by curved passages were added. These incorporated additional accommodation and a library, but the passages and south wing were later demolished.|$|E
5|$|The central {{window of}} the North Aisle is a World War II {{memorial}} and a World War I memorial {{is on the other}} side. The Moores Chantry Chapel (or Moor Hayes Chapel) occupying the easternmost bay of the North Aisle, was built by the Moor (alias Moore) family, long resident at Moor Hayes within the parish, and contains some original box pews. At the rear (western end) of the church are two large pieces of oak which make up a Golgotha which once rested on top of the Rood Screen. They are <b>carved</b> <b>with</b> rocks, skulls and bones. They were probably removed from the church in 1549 and cut into 2 pieces. For many years they remained in the graveyard.|$|E
5|$|The font has a Norman {{bowl with}} lead lining {{set on a}} 19th-century base. It {{consists}} of a round bowl <b>carved</b> <b>with</b> figures, and simple ornamentation. For many years {{it had been in}} the garden of nearby Dorfold Hall before being reinstated in the church. At the east end of the south aisle are carved stones, some in sandstone, others in limestone. The style of the limestone stones suggests a date at the end of the 11thcentury and that of the sandstone stones around 1100. They are considered to be among the most significant pieces of Romanesque sculpture in the country. There is a ring of six bells. Five of these were cast by Rudhall of Gloucester in the 18thcentury and the sixth by John Taylor & Co in 1893. The parish registers begin in 1653 and the churchwardens' accounts in 1755. The two-manual organ was made by Alex Young and Sons of Manchester in 1897, and was renovated in 1939, and again in 1997.|$|E
