50|$|Maintaining {{a uniform}} {{gap between the}} rolls is {{difficult}} because the rolls deflect under the load required to deform the workpiece. The deflection causes the workpiece to be thinner on the edges and thicker in the middle. This can be overcome by using a <b>crowned</b> <b>roller</b> (parabolic crown), however the <b>crowned</b> <b>roller</b> will only compensate for one set of conditions, specifically the material, temperature, and amount of deformation.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{geometry}} and material of the Micro/Nano particle on contact mechanic for manipulation was studied {{in this work}} based on atomic force microscopy. Hertz contact model simulation for EpH biological micro particle with spherical, cylindrical, and circular <b>crowned</b> <b>roller</b> shape was used to investigate the effect of geometry on contact simulation process in manipulation. Then, to validate the simulation results, they were compared to experimental ones. The results can be interpreted from two perspectives, first {{from the perspective of}} types of nanoparticles and second from the perspective of types of theories. To investigate the effect of the material of micro/nano particle in contact mechanic simulation process, spherical contact simulations of two EpH and C 3 T 3 cells were compared with each other. EpH cells simulations with different geometries showed that the cylindrical shape estimation did not provide accurate response due to longer contact length. However, spherical and circular <b>crowned</b> <b>roller</b> estimations which had 19. 6 % and 15. 6 % difference from experimental results, respectively, had relatively accurate response. Therefore, selection of circular <b>crowned</b> <b>roller</b> geometry will produce more logical response. Also, the comparison of spherical contact simulation of EpH and C 3 T 3 cells showed that C 3 T 3 cell shows more indention depth under the same applied force...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Double-row {{tapered roller}} bearing 353112 is used in trucks, and the {{external}} load and pressure distribution of the bearing are calculated combining with the specific operating conditions. Tapered roller bearings typically employ roller profile modification to equalize the load distribution, minimize the stress concentration at the roller ends. Doing FEA (finite element analysis) on the contact stress with the changing <b>roller</b> <b>crowning</b> between <b>roller</b> and races, the appropriate roller profile and the <b>crown</b> drop of <b>roller</b> can be achieved. Finally the best control equation of <b>roller</b> <b>crowning</b> is given out.

50|$|After {{the center}} of U.S. flour milling moved to the east coast, the company's A and F Mills closed during the 1940s and 1950s. Of the 34 Minneapolis flour mills, only four are still {{standing}} on the Mississippi's west bank. Of the four, the <b>Crown</b> <b>Roller</b> Mill and the Standard Mill were Northwestern mills (the A and F mills).

40|$|In {{the higher}} pairs of a mechanism, {{like the one}} {{existing}} between a cam and roller follower, {{it is common to}} localize the maximum deformations, the maximum contact pressures and that appears the surface fatigue failure due to the relative motion between the cam and the roller. The formulations that characterized the contact are based in Hertz elastic contact theory. In this paper the contact between a cam and a <b>crowned</b> <b>roller</b> is studied applying the formulation for elliptical point contact proposed by Johnson. The contact ellipse obtained experimentally is presented to validate the elliptical point contact. The comparison of the width of the axes of the contact ellipse obtained experimentally and by the formulation presents the same level of errors than more sophisticated experimental methods.

40|$|Measurements {{were made}} of the {{limiting}} shear stress for two naphthenic oils of differing molecular weight and three blends of the lower molecular weight oil and polyalkylmethacrylate polymers of differing molecular weight. The two base oils reached the same limiting shear stress for the same temperature and pressure. This was also true for all the polymer solutions although the polymer reduced the limiting shear stress by about 15 percent. It is shown that limiting stress is more a function of material type than viscosity or molecular weight. A new falling body viscometer was constructed to operate to 230 C and 0. 6 GPa. Another viscometer was constructed to extend the pressure range to 1. 1 GPa. A concentrated contact simulator was developed which allows recording of the traction force while the slide-roll ratio is continuously varied and the rolling speed is maintained essentially constant by a single drive motor. The configuration {{is that of a}} <b>crowned</b> <b>roller</b> against a disk. Measurement of lubricant minimum film thickness of elliptical EHD contacts of various aspect ratios were made by optical interferometry. The data collected were used to evaluate the Hamrock and Dowson minimum film thickness model over a range of contract ellipticity ratio where the major axis of the contact ellipse was aligned both parallel and perpendicular to the direction of motion. A statistical analysis of the measured film thickness data showed that on the average the experimental data were 30 percent greater than the film thickness predicted by the model.

5|$|The <b>Crown</b> <b>Roller</b> Mills {{building}} {{is not in}} Princes Street itself, but rather lies {{at the foot of}} Manor Place, close to its intersection with Princes Street. It stands {{at the edge of a}} small area of parkland called the Market Reserve, at the opposite edge of which is the city's main bus depot. This area was swampland when the first European settlers arrived in Dunedin, but was reclaimed and did host a regular market for a few years from the 1870s. The market was not well-supported, however, and eventually folded. The bus depot is located on the site of the city's 1902 Tram workshops. The Market Reserve also contains a children's playground and, at the edge closes to the <b>Crown</b> <b>Roller</b> Mills Building, a small monument dedicated to Otago workers who have lost their lives while at work. This simple bluestone memorial was erected in 2003 by the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions on a site donated by the Dunedin City Council.|$|R

40|$|Cylindrical roller {{bearings}} typically employ roller profile modification to equalize load distribution, minimize stress concentration at roller ends {{and allow for}} {{a small amount of}} misalignment. The 1947 Lundberg-Palmgren analysis reported an inverse fourth power relation between load and life for {{roller bearings}} with line contact. In 1952, Lundberg and Palmgren changed their load-life exponent to 10 / 3 for roller bearings, assuming mixed line and point contact. The effect of roller-crown profile was reanalyzed in this paper to determine the actual load-life relation for modified roller profiles. For uncrowned rollers (line contact), the load-life exponent is p = 4, in agreement with the 1947 Lundberg-Palmgren value but crowning reduces the value of the exponent, p. The lives of modern roller bearings made from vacuum-processed steels significantly exceed those predicted by the Lundberg-Palmgren theory. The Zaretsky rolling-element bearing life model of 1996 produces a load-life exponent of p = 5 for flat rollers, which is more consistent with test data. For the Zaretsky model with fully <b>crowned</b> <b>rollers</b> p = 4. 3. For an aerospace profile and chamfered rollers, p = 4. 6. Using the 1952 Lundberg-Palmgren value p = 10 / 3, the value incorporated in ANSI/ABMA and ISO bearing standards, can create significant life calculation errors for roller bearings...|$|R

40|$|Due to dynamic effects, clearances, {{manufacturing}} and assembly errors in form-closed cam mechanisms, the follower jump can also occur. For conjugate cam mechanisms {{a technique to}} avoid the follower jump {{without the use of}} a spring involves making the conjugate cam profiles bigger than the kinematical ones by adding an external offset. This strategy produces an interference fit between the conjugate cam profiles and the follower train. This paper presents an ordered procedure to study the influence that the planned interference fit has on the evaluation of the contact forces, the expected fatigue life of the rollers, contact pressures and the lubrication conditions. The study is based on a conjugate cam mechanism with translational roller followers used in a real automatic process for manufacturing muselets. A three-degree-of-freedom dynamic model is proposed and the Hertzian theory for general profiles is used to model the nonlinear contact stiffness between the cams and the <b>crowned</b> <b>rollers.</b> The dynamic model predicts {{that it is difficult to}} obtain conjugate cam mechanisms with an infinite expected fatigue life of the rollers just by considering typical achievable manufacturing errors or clearances, and as happens in reality, a set-up process is highly recommended. The procedure is also tested with measured manufacturing errors on a coordinate measure machine—CMM—and with measured radial internal clearances for the rollers measured by an experimental apparatus. Also, to evaluate lubrication conditions, surface finishing measurements have been taken of the cams and the rollers with a surface profiler. Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|The {{quest for}} energy {{efficiency}} {{leads to the}} development of highly efficient power transmissions for vehicles. Gears {{are some of the most}} rugged and durable torque transmitters among machine elements. Friction between sliding surfaces at gear teeth is one major source of power loss. To increase efficiency and reduce damage accumulation in gears has always been a background motivation to this thesis. It focuses on the frictional performance of manufactured gear surfaces with emphasis on the effect of surface topography and the orientation of its lay. To achieve the goal of this work, a test rig was designed and constructed. The rig makes it possible to examine gear tooth friction on double <b>crowned</b> <b>rollers.</b> Five alternative gear-finishing processes are implemented in roller surface preparation. They comprise grinding, shotpeening, phosphating, chemical deburring and DLC coating. Theoretically, a friction model is suggested which helps to explain some of the testing results. Advanced surface metrology techniques and statistical tools are implemented in identifying surface features that influence friction. The result demonstrates that surface topography is a significant factor affecting the lubricated frictional behaviour. For ground-finishing, the smoother the surfaces are finished, the lower friction coefficient they show. Chemical deburring and DLC coating as well as certain degrees of phosphating provide minimum friction coefficient and improved load carrying capacity, which are competitive to fine-ground finishing. Properly designed lay combinations of meshing gear surfaces can minimise friction and improve gear transmission efficiency. Theoretically, the friction coefficient can be explained by means of a combination of the slide-to-roll ratio and the real mean contact pressure within the range of loads considered in this thesis. Finally, features that correlate surface topography to friction are identified...|$|R
40|$|A {{theory of}} {{kinematic}} stabilization of rolling cylinders is developed for high-speed cylindrical roller bearings. This stabilization requires race and <b>roller</b> <b>crowning</b> to produce {{changes in the}} rolling geometry as the roller shifts axially. These changes put a reverse skew in the rolling elements by changing the rolling taper. Twelve basic possible bearing modifications are identified in this paper.

40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} {{consider}} a nontrivial three-dimensional viscoelastic contact problem which has some physical significance. (Although {{the subject of}} the analysis is an elliptical roller, it is only a small step onward to the consideration of a <b>crowned</b> cylindrical <b>roller.)</b> Generally, it is the intractability of the mathematics which hinders analytic solution of true three-dimensional problems in (visco) elasticity. The traditional method of surmounting this difficulty is to reduce the problem to two dimensions, either by choosing a suitable geometry, or by using an appropriate co-ordinate system. The elastic line integral theory represents another approach; certain approximations are used to simplify the governing equations, thus allowing the solution of the problem. After the development of a viscoelastic analogue of the Boussinesq equation valid for the solution of quasi-steady state viscoelastic contact problems, analysis proceeds making use of near field and extended line integral approximations. Results are generated showing the velocity dependence of several physical parameters, including {{the size and shape of}} the contact zone. One additional point of interest is uncovered, namely the presence of a pressure peak near the leading edge of the contact zone. 1...|$|R
