50|$|Internally {{the fixed}} valve body is {{constructed}} as a cylinder, with the moving {{part of the}} valve within this as a piston. The <b>conical</b> <b>valve</b> {{is part of this}} piston. The piston is double-acting and splits the internal valve body in two, with water pressure on both sides. The upper side of the piston is larger, the full diameter of the piston, and is supplied with water through a throttling valve; normally adjusted and then left in position. The lower side of the piston is an annular space surrounding the moving valve body and maintained at the lower (Bernoulli) water pressure. The tip of the <b>conical</b> <b>valve</b> contains a small pilot valve, linking the upper chamber of the valve to the downstream drain below the valve. This pilot valve is controlled mechanically from outside the valve chamber and is the main control over the valve position.|$|E

5000|$|In the 9th century, Banū Mūsā brothers' Book of Ingenious Devices {{described}} {{a number of}} early automatic controls in fluid mechanics. Two-step level controls for fluids, an early form of discontinuous variable structure controls, {{was developed by the}} Banu Musa brothers. They also {{described a}}n early feedback controller for fluids. According to Donald Routledge Hill, the Banu Musa brothers were [...] "masters in the exploitation of small variations" [...] in hydrostatic pressures and in using <b>conical</b> <b>valves</b> as [...] "in-line" [...] components in flow systems, [...] "the first known use of <b>conical</b> <b>valves</b> as automatic controllers." [...] They also described the use of other valves, including a plug valve, float valve and tap. The Banu Musa also developed an early fail-safe system where [...] "one can withdraw small quantities of liquid repeatedly, but if one withdraws a large quantity, no further extractions are possible." [...] The double-concentric siphon and the funnel with bent end for pouring in different liquids, neither of which appear in any earlier Greek works, were also original inventions by the Banu Musa brothers. Some of the other mechanisms they described include a float chamber and an early differential pressure.|$|R

As these valves must work at high pressure, the valve faces are accurately ground to shape. The valve is also held accurately concentric to its seat by a fluted extension, usually cross-shaped or three-winged, below the seat. This extension {{is merely a}} guide and does not act as a valve.|$|E

2500|$|The word {{trombone}} {{derives from}} Italian tromba (trumpet) and -one (a suffix meaning [...] "large"), so the name means [...] "large trumpet". The trombone has a predominantly cylindrical bore like its valved counterpart the baritone and {{in contrast to}} its <b>conical</b> <b>valved</b> counterparts, the euphonium and the horn. The most frequently encountered trombones are the tenor trombone and bass trombone. The most common variant, the tenor, is a non-transposing instrument pitched in B, an octave below the B trumpet and an octave above the B tuba. The once common E alto trombone became less widely used as improvements in technique extended the upper range of the tenor, but it is now enjoying a resurgence due to its lighter sonority which is appreciated in many classical and early romantic works. Trombone music, along with music for euphonium and tuba, is typically written in concert pitch in either bass or tenor clef, although exceptions do occur, notably in almost all brass-band music where tenor trombone {{is presented as a}} B transposing instrument, written in treble clef.|$|R

Various experiments have been performed and has revealed two different approaches one for attaining high cold mass fraction and the other for attaining cold end temperature. The geometry requirement is different for the two approaches. The need is to have a tube to produce higher mass of cold air coming out at low temperature. For this purpose converging type of vortex tube is experimented and the results are promising. The results show increase in cold mass fraction as well as cold end temperature. The overall change in cold end temperature drop was 63 % and the COP of the converging tube as compared to straight divergent tube increased by 102 %.

40|$|The dynamic response, {{stability}} and fluid-borne noise characteristics of fluid power components and {{systems can be}} strongly influenced by the inertia or 'hydraulic inductance' of the fluid in passageways, which are often of complex geometry.

This paper presents a method of numerical calculation of the hydraulic inductance in a passageway. The method is simple to apply and can be applied to geometries of arbitrary complexity. A simple way of using a Computational Fluid Dynamics package for calculating hydraulic inductance is also demonstrated.

5000|$|Sickels {{obtained}} a patent for this invention, {{which he called}} 'Manner of constructing the apparatus for lifting, tripping, and regulating the closing of valves of steam engines' on March 20, 1842 (U.S. patent number 2631). Thurston (1878:317) relates [...] "It was introduced by the inventor in a form which especially adapted it to use with the beam-engine used on the Eastern waters of the United States, and was adapted to stationary engines by Messrs. Thurston, Greene & Co., of Providence, R. I., who made use of it for some years before {{any other form of}} [...] "drop cut-off" [...] came into general use. The Sickels cut-off consisted of a set of steam-valves, usually independent of the exhaust-valves, and each raised by a catch, which could be thrown out, at the proper moment, by a wedge with which it came in contact as it rose with the opening valve. This wedge, or other equivalent device, was so adjusted that the valve should be detached and fall to its seat when the piston reached that point in its movement, after taking steam, at which expansion was to commence. From this point, no steam entering the cylinder, the piston was impelled by the expanding vapor. The valve was usually the double-poppet.". As described by Somerscales (1990:283) it was 'a quick-closing valve gear using poppet valves, and a trip gear to control the cut-off ... with gravity assisted closure ... Sickels used a water-filled dashpot to decelerate the valve smoothly as it approached the end of its travel.'. [...] The device was not applied to the slide valve, which later became so ubiquitous in steam engines, but to poppet valves (also known as 'puppet valves' and 'drop valves'). These were first used by Watt for his beam engines in the 1770s or 1780s. Watt had fitted two <b>conical</b> <b>valves</b> to the upper steam passage to the steam cylinder and two to the lower passage. This is well illustrated in the text by Lardner (1840). [...] This arrangement of two such valves per steam passage was described as the 'double-beat', 'balanced' or 'equilibrium' poppet valve by various authors (see e.g. Clark 1891). [...] A schematic of equilibrium poppet valves appears in Buchanan and Watkins (1976) reproduced with further discussion in connection with Sickels by Somerscales (1990). However to reiterate, it is not the double poppet valve that can be attributed to Sickels, but a particular manner of its operation.|$|R
40|$|Tomteluva perturbata gen. et sp. nov. and Nasakia thulensis gen. et sp. nov., two new rhynchonelliformean brachiopod taxa, are {{described}} from carbonate beds {{from the lower}} middle Cambrian (Series 3, Stage 5) basinal Stephen Formation, Canada, and the upper lower Cambrian (Series 2, Stage 4) Henson Gletscher Formation, North Greenland, respectively. The two taxa are characterized by an unusual coral-like morphology typified by a high <b>conical</b> ventral <b>valve</b> with an anteriorly curved umbo and a tube-like structure inside the ventral valve, interpreted as pedicle tube. Both resemble the problematic late middle Cambrian (Drumian) species Anomalocalyx cawoodi Brock from Australia, whose systematic affiliation is controversial. Together, the three genera are interpreted as representatives of a new family of rhynchonelliformean brachiopods, the Tomteluvidae fam. nov., which is interpreted as an aberrant or derived taxon within the Order Naukatida. Convergence between the Tomteluvidae and the coralla of small solitary Cambrian coralimorphs, {{as well as the}} late Palaeozoic reef-building richthofenioid brachiopods, might indicate adaptation to a similar life habits and environments. However, their small size (length 4 mm), well-developed pedicle and perfect morphological symmetry make it more likely that tomteluvids lived attached to frondose algae or sponges, above the seafloor, in a similar fashion to the acrotretoid brachiopods with which they show a high degree of morphological convergence. Morphological features of the pedicle tube of N. thulensis suggest that the tomteluvid pedicle is homologous to that in modern rhynchonelliformean brachiopods. This is the first evidence of the pedicle type within the Naukatida and represents the oldest confirmation of a rhynchonellate pedicle...|$|R
