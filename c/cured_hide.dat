In this article, a mathematical description of chemical deliming is proposed, based on the unreacted nucleus approach. Numerical solution of the model is found, concentration fields of the reacting chemicals described, and the evolution of the acido-basic boundary inside calcimine shown. The model is used to justify a simplified way to determine the effective diffusion coefficient of the deliming agent.

Avšak tento proces má tři důležité nevýhody: 1) doba konzervace je minimalně 18 hodin; 2) nedostatečný stupeň konzervace u některé suroviny a možná nízká účinnost solného roztoku a konečně dopady na životní prostředí. Cílem příspevku je řešení všech třech problémů Nejprve jsme provedli studium absorpce soli a popsali mechanismus konzervace proto, abychom dosahli snižení doby trvání kozervace. Mechanismus je popsán difúzním modelem, který popisuje rozlozeni chloridu sodného v k?ži během konzervace, dále stanovení optimálních nákladů na proces. difúze solného roztoku do suroviny byl sledovaný měřením vodivosti zbytkového chloridu v lázni, vlhkost a obsah popele v konzervované k?ži a stanovení sodíku uvnitř suroviny. The {{most common}} method of {{preserving}} raw hides is brine curing with sodium chloride. However, {{this process has}} three important disadvantages: first, {{the length of time}} that it takes, which is a minimum of 18 hourssecond, the insufficient degree of curing reached in some hides due to an overload and possibly the low efficiency of the brine racewayand finally, the environmental impact associated with the discharge of large quantities of electrolytes in the soaking step. Our long term goal is to address all three issues. Initially, we have carried out a study of the salt uptake and its diffusion mechanism in order to attempt a reduction in the curing time. A continuous reaction mathematical model of a closed one dimensional system that describes the diffusion of sodium chloride in the hide during the curing process was chosen in the search for the optimum brine curing conditions such as the optimum brine concentration and percent float. The effect of these two parameters on the values of effective diffusivity coefficients was reported. Moreover, the dependency of these coefficients with time was examined, showing an initial fast uptake zone followed by a slow and quite flat uptake zone. Brine diffusion into the hide was tracked by measurement of the electrolytic conductivity of the residual brine solution and moisture and ash content of the <b>cured</b> <b>hide.</b> In addition, a piece of hide was cured with a fluorescently labeled brine solution and analyzed by means of confocal laser scanning microscopy for direct visualization of the sodium location within the hide...|$|E

30|$|Camel hides are {{important}} sources {{of foreign exchange}} earnings for Kenya and other African countries. However, {{it has been observed}} that the full potential of camel hides has not been realized nor exploited in Kenya. This has been attributed to poor quality of hides which leads to low demand in both domestic and export markets. This led to the need for Kenya Agricultural Research Institute Marsabit Centre to conduct this study, which aimed at assessing the production, marketing and utilization of camel hides from northern Kenya. The study took place in major areas that produce and market camel hides in Kenya, namely Moyale, Marsabit, Isiolo, Garisa, Wajir (pastoral regions in arid and semi-arid areas ASALS) and Nairobi city. Research methods included semi-structured questionnaires, key informants, direct observation and documentary information. The results showed that camel hides were mainly sold in the big towns of northern Kenya and Nairobi. The study also indicated that camel hides were of poor quality due to poor flaying and curing methods. The study also revealed that most camel hides are used for domestic purposes. Pastoral communities need to be encouraged to sell their camel hides. There is a need to train camel keepers on appropriate methods of flaying and <b>curing</b> <b>hides.</b> There is a need for policy makers to consider improving the roads in the ASALS and to lower taxes charged on hides.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} days of Canada's European settlement, trappers brought {{shiploads}} of salt with them for personal uses such as <b>curing</b> <b>hides</b> and salting meat, as well as trading with the First Nations peoples. In 1860, the salt industry in the area was begun in Michigan, by the Saginaw Salt and Lumber Company. They began producing salt in limited amounts, as their main industry was lumber. In roughly 1890, William Van Horne, president of the Canadian Pacific Railway("CPR"), realized the potential of the region. The company sunk a test well on CPR's land in Windsor and found salt in 1891. The test well was supervised by E.G Henderson, the civil engineer who supervised the CPR's London to Windsor Line. He would become the plant manager of the Windsor Salt mine, which was built and operational in 1893. One reason for the CPR's interest in the Windsor Salt Mine is attributed to a desire to enable the company to haul freight in order to compete with other railroad companies such as the Grand Trunk Railway. From the beginning, Windsor's mine has been unique in Canada, using a vacuum pan technique that is utilized in the U.S., but not in Canada. Perhaps this is a tangible symbol of the close connection between the two nations in the border area.|$|R

40|$|From Summary: A {{survey of}} collagenolytic aerobic {{bacteria}} from <b>cured</b> <b>hides</b> yielded three strains of Bacillus and eight of Achromobacter which degraded collagen at 0. 4 M NaCl. Achromobacter sp. 2 {{was chosen for}} genetic studies due to its high collagenolytic activity {{and the lack of}} genetic information on Achromobacter. Four temperate bacteriophages specific for Achromobacter sp. 2 were isolated and their relationships studied. The phages caused lysogenic conversion resulting in the inability of lysogens to adsorb phage. Achromobacter sp. 2 was shown to be a cryptic lysogen as it was not immune to superinfection but had a very low rate of spontaneous induction which could be increased with mutagens. It is proposed that the cryptic lysogeny of this strain is maintained by a defective excision mechanism and the mode of prophage integration in the host chromosome. DNA extracted from phage α 3 a was used to transfect spheroplasts. The optimal conditions for the development of competence for transfection were determined. The presence of nuclease-attack on phage DNA under conditions of prolonged incubation of DNA and spheroplasts was proposed. A method for extracting Achromobacter DNA was devised which yielded purified, undegraded DNA, but {{it was not possible to}} transform Achromobacter sp. 2 with this DNA. The a phages were used to transduce a number of genetic markers into Achromobacter auxotrophs. The transduct ants had the ability to release the cryptic α 3 prophage at a high rate while maintaining their sensitivity to homologous phage infection. It is proposed that this is due to complementation between the cryptic prophage and the residual phage functions in the transducing particles. The transductants segregated auxotrophs with a probability of 10 ⁻³ per cell per generation. It appears that an unusual system of generalised transduction is operating whereby the transducing particles contain both phage and bacterial DNA which is incorporated into the recipient genome by a single recombination event yielding unstable transductants. In a study on induction of Escherichia coli (λ), carcinogenic nitrosamines were shown to be inducers of phage development. This provides a screening system for potentially harmful nitrosamines...|$|R
