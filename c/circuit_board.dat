5|$|The <b>circuit</b> <b>board</b> of Radar Scope was {{restructured}} for Donkey Kong. The Radar Scope hardware, originally {{inspired by}} the Namco Galaxian hardware, was designed for {{a large number of}} enemies moving around at high speeds, which Donkey Kong did not require, so the development team removed unnecessary functions and reduced the scale of the <b>circuit</b> <b>board.</b> While the gameplay and graphics were reworked for updated ROM chips, the existing CPU, sound hardware and monitor were left intact. The character set, scoreboard, upper HUD display and font are almost identical to Radar Scope, with palette differences. The Donkey Kong hardware had the memory capacity for displaying 128 foreground sprites at 16x16 pixels each and 256 background tiles at 8x8 pixels each. Mario and all moving objects used single sprites, the taller Pauline used two sprites, and the larger Donkey Kong used six sprites.|$|E

5|$|Inside the case, {{there were}} many more {{similarities}} with the ZX81. Like its successor, it used the Z80A microprocessor and had only 1KB of on-board RAM. It came with a specially written BASIC interpreter on a dedicated ROM chip and could use a television as a display. It relied on an ordinary cassette tape recorder for data storage. The main {{difference between the two}} machines lay in the internal software; when the ZX81 was released, ZX80 owners were able to upgrade by the relatively simple expedient of plugging a new ROM onto the <b>circuit</b> <b>board.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Nexus7 {{is powered}} by a 4,325mAh {{lithium-ion}} polymer battery that typically lasts 9.5hours and can be charged via micro-USB. In order to maximize the device's battery life, Asus engineers spent one month attempting to reduce electrical leakage by measuring heat and voltage at every point on the printed <b>circuit</b> <b>board</b> (PCB). The tablet includes a highly efficient power management integrated circuit designed by Maxim Integrated Products. Google claims the Nexus7's battery life allows 9hours of HD video playback, 10hours of web browsing or e-reading, and 300hours on standby.|$|E
5|$|Ed Roberts and Bill Yates {{finished}} the first prototype in October 1974 and shipped it to Popular Electronics in New York via the Railway Express Agency. However, it never arrived {{due to a}} strike by the shipping company. Solomon already {{had a number of}} pictures of the machine and the article was based on them. Roberts got to work on building a replacement. The computer on the magazine cover is an empty box with just switches and LEDs on the front panel. The finished Altair computer had a completely different <b>circuit</b> <b>board</b> layout than the prototype shown in the magazine.|$|E

50|$|Sarmanian was {{a pioneer}} in the electro-chemical {{production}} of printed <b>circuit</b> <b>boards.</b> The new process offered far greater reliability for the printed <b>circuit</b> <b>boards</b> and far higher density (chips and circuitry per square inch) for packaging components.|$|R
5|$|The logic board, {{the central}} <b>circuit</b> <b>board</b> of the computer, {{was based on}} the Macintosh SE design. Its size, however, was reduced using surface mount {{technology}} to 9×5inches (23×13cm), half the size of the SE board. This redesign, and the absence of expansion slots, kept manufacturing costs low. This lack of expansion abilities, along with the small screen size and Macintosh's popularity in the burgeoning field of desktop publishing led to such oddities as video displays that connected through the SCSI port by users seeking to connect a larger full- or dual-page display to their Mac. The Classic design was used once more in 1991 for the Classic II, which succeeded the Classic and replaced the Macintosh SE/30.|$|E
5|$|For {{clarity of}} presentation, the {{diagrams}} {{in this article}} are drawn with the components implemented in stripline format. This does not imply an industry preference, although planar transmission line formats (that is, formats where conductors consist of flat strips) are popular because they can be implemented using established printed <b>circuit</b> <b>board</b> manufacturing techniques. The structures shown can also be implemented using microstrip or buried stripline techniques (with suitable adjustments to dimensions) and can be adapted to coaxial cables, twin leads and waveguides, although some structures are more suitable for some implementations than others. The open wire implementations, for instance, of a number of structures are shown in the second column of figure 3 and open wire equivalents can be found for most other stripline structures. Planar transmission lines are also used in integrated circuit designs.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals {{or their}} {{compounds}} {{can be found}} in electronic components, electrodes, and wiring and solar panels where they may be used as either conductors, semiconductors, or insulators. Molybdenum powder is used in <b>circuit</b> <b>board</b> inks. Ruthenium(IV) oxide coated titanium anodes are used for the industrial production of chlorine. Home electrical systems, for the most part, are wired with copper wire for its good conducting properties. Silver and gold are used in electrical and electronic devices, particularly in contact switches, {{as a result of their}} high electrical conductivity and capacity to resist or minimise the formation of impurities on their surfaces. The semiconductors cadmium telluride and gallium arsenide are used to make solar panels. Hafnium oxide, an insulator, is used as a voltage controller in microchips; tantalum oxide, another insulator, is used in capacitors in mobile phones. Heavy metals have been used in batteries for over 200 years, at least since Volta invented his copper and silver voltaic pile in 1800. Promethium, lanthanum, and mercury are further examples found in, respectively, atomic, nickel-metal hydride, and button cell batteries.|$|E
40|$|The printed <b>circuit</b> <b>boards</b> {{basis of}} {{electronic}} equipment {{have seen a}} rapid growth {{in recent years and}} {{played a significant role in}} modern life. Nowadays, the fact that electronic devices upgrade quickly necessitates a proper management of waste printed <b>circuit</b> <b>boards.</b> Non-destructive desoldering of waste printed <b>circuit</b> <b>boards</b> becomes the first and the most crucial step towards recycling electronic components. Owing to the diversity of materials and components, the separation process is difficult, which results in complex and expensive recovery of precious materials and electronic components from waste printed <b>circuit</b> <b>boards.</b> To cope with this problem, we proposed an innovative approach integrating Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) evolution theory and technology maturity mapping system to forecast the evolution trends of desoldering technology of waste printed <b>circuit</b> <b>boards.</b> This approach can be applied to analyse the technology evolution, as well as desoldering technology evolution, then research and development strategy and evolution laws can be recommended. As an example, the maturity of desoldering technology is analysed with a technology maturity mapping system model. What is more, desoldering methods in different stages are analysed and compared. According to the analysis, the technological evolution trends are predicted to be 'the law of energy conductivity' and 'increasing the degree of idealisation'. And the potential technology and evolutionary state of waste printed <b>circuit</b> <b>boards</b> are predicted, offering reference for future waste printed <b>circuit</b> <b>boards</b> recycling...|$|R

5|$|The {{engineering}} and prototyping for Asteroid {{was done by}} Alcorn. The game is encoded entirely in discrete electronic components, like Atari's earlier games, and unlike later computer-based arcade games; the graphics are all simple line elements {{with the exception of}} the spacecraft, which are generated based on diodes on the <b>circuit</b> <b>board</b> arranged in the shape of half of a ship to represent the shape they create. That half ship is mirrored on the screen, similar to the diode array in Computer Space, which generated eight directions of a rotating ship with a mirrored four images. The game was completed quickly, and Alcorn soon moved on to Atari's third game, Gotcha. When the game was complete, the design was given to Midway to sell under that name, only for Atari to produce a nearly identical version itself titled Space Race, which was released on July 16, 1973.|$|E

They are interrupted by the local augur, Lucius Petrus Dextrus, who has arrived to collect a sculpture he commissioned. The Doctor is intrigued by the sculpture, which resembles a segment of an oversized <b>circuit</b> <b>board.</b> Lucius Petrus reveals that he also has powerful ESP and calls out the name of the Doctor's home planet, Gallifrey. The Doctor wishes {{to learn more about the}} sculptures and enlists Caecilius's son Quintus to help him break into Lucius Petrus' house. Inside, the Doctor deduces that the circuits will make an energy converter, but he is caught by Lucius Petrus. The two escape, but Lucius Petrus beckons a large stone creature to attack and kill them. The stone creature appears in Caecilius's house and attacks them, but Quintus saves them by dousing the creature in water and killing it. In the confusion, the Sisterhood kidnap Donna, and the Doctor sets off to rescue her. He meets the high priestess of the Sisterhood, who is revealed to be transforming into a stone creature. The Doctor discovers that they are being controlled by the Pyroviles, volcanic creatures whose home planet of Pyrovilia was lost. The Doctor is attacked by the Sisterhood, but he escapes with Donna into an underground tunnel that leads into the heart of Mount Vesuvius.|$|E
5|$|This shift by Timex came at {{an ideal}} time for Sinclair. The ZX80 had proved {{more popular than}} {{expected}} and Sinclair's existing manufacturer, a small electronics company in St Ives, lacked the resources {{to deal with the}} demand. Timex took over production of the ZX80 late in 1980. The arrangement worked well for both companies and Timex took on the manufacture of the ZX81, aided by capital investment in its Dundee plant. Sinclair initially planned to produce 10,000 ZX81s a month, rising to 30,000 a month within a year. However, Timex initially had significant problems in producing enough ZX81s to satisfy demand. As a consequence, it took up to nine weeks for ZX81s to be delivered by mail order. It was not until September 1981, five months after the launch of the ZX81, that the delivery times finally came down to the promised twenty-eight days. Those who already owned or had recently ordered the ZX80 were not excluded; anyone who had ordered a ZX80 in the two weeks before the ZX81's launch would receive the newer machine, while existing owners were able to upgrade their ZX80s by plugging an extra £20 ROM chip into the <b>circuit</b> <b>board.</b>|$|E

40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of solderability testing of printed <b>circuit</b> <b>boards.</b> The aim {{of this paper is to}} compare different atmospheres for solderability testing with different finishes of printed <b>circuit</b> <b>boards</b> (PCB’s). The article contains method descriptions that were used for solderability testing of printed <b>circuit</b> <b>boards.</b> The method of wetting balance test was chosen for this experiment. The PCB can be made with several kinds of surface finishing. Copper is the most commonly used material in the manufacture of printed <b>circuit</b> <b>boards.</b> The negative copper property is its low chemical stability. When a contact is in an atmosphere that contains oxygen, the surface is covered with a layer of copper oxides. This layer deteriorates copper solderability. Another way how to prevent oxidation of copper soldering pads of printed <b>circuit</b> <b>boards</b> is an inert atmosphere. As an inert atmosphere does not contain oxygen and prevents oxidation of the material used on PCB’s. The increasingly frequent introduction of inert atmospheres into soldering processes encourages the introduction of a inert atmosphere also in solderability testing processes...|$|R
