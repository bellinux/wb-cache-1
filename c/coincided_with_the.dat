50|$|The Lunar {{equatorial}} {{regions are}} likely to have higher concentrations of helium-3 (rare on Earth but much sought after for use in nuclear fusion research) because the solar wind has a higher angle of incidence.

Berhtwald also was the recipient of the first surviving letter close in Western Europe.|$|E
