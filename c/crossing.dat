5|$|A {{number of}} new {{crossings}} have been proposed as relief for the Dartford <b>Crossing.</b> The proposed Thames Gateway Bridge to the west was given planning permission by Transport for London (TfL) in December 2004, but was cancelled in November 2008 when Boris Johnson became Mayor of London. Johnson subsequently proposed the Gallions Reach Ferry, a ferry <b>crossing</b> in the same location, as an alternative. The Lower Thames <b>Crossing</b> is a proposed tunnel to the east between Shorne, Kent and South Ockendon, Essex. Thurrock Council suggest that this <b>crossing</b> will be essential for managing congestion. A public consultation on the scheme ended in March 2016, with the route announced in April 2017, though Highways England {{do not expect to}} start construction before 2026.|$|E
5|$|A second attack, {{simultaneous}} {{with the}} <b>crossing</b> at Kehl, occurred at Hüningen near Basel. After <b>crossing</b> unopposed, Ferino advanced in a dual-prong east along the German {{shore of the}} Rhine with the 16th and 50th demi-brigades, the 68th and 50th and 68th line infantry, and six squadrons of cavalry that included the 3rd and 7th Hussars and the 10th Dragoons.|$|E
5|$|About 09:45, the LI Infantry Corps began <b>crossing</b> the Drava, but {{construction}} of a bridge near Maribor was suspended because the river was in flood. Despite this, the 183rd Infantry Division managed to secure an alternative <b>crossing</b> point, and established a bridgehead. This <b>crossing</b> point was a partially destroyed bridge, guarded by a single platoon of the 1st Bicycle Battalion of Detachment Ormozki. This <b>crossing,</b> combined with {{the withdrawal of the}} 7th Army's 38th Infantry Division Dravska from the line Slovenska Bistrica–Ptuj exposed the left flank of Detachment Ormozki. The Detachment attempted to withdraw south, but began to disintegrate during the night 10/11 April, and the 1st Bicycle Battalion left to return to Ljubljana. In the afternoon, the remaining elements of the 42nd Infantry Division Murska also began to withdraw though Varaždinske Toplice to Novi Marof, leaving the Ustaše to take control of Varaždin.|$|E

The parallel alignments of NY205 and CR11 end a short distance to the north in the hamlet of Hartwick as CR11 enters the community on the east–west Main Street and intersects NY205 in the hamlet's center. CR11 leaves NY205 for good outside of Hartwick, continuing on a generally easterly track toward Cooperstown, while NY205 passes Hartwick Town Park and crosses over Otego Creek as it heads northward into the town of Otsego.|$|E

When the <b>cross</b> does not reach the edges of the field, it becomes a mobile charge. The plain Greek <b>cross</b> (with equal limbs) and Latin <b>cross</b> (with the lower limb extended) are sometimes seen, but more often the tip of each limb is developed into some ornamental shape. The most commonly found <b>crosses</b> in heraldry include the <b>cross</b> botonny, the <b>cross</b> flory, the <b>cross</b> moline, the <b>cross</b> potent, the <b>cross</b> patée or formée, the <b>cross</b> patonce and the <b>cross</b> crosslet.|$|R

500|$|The Knight's <b>Cross</b> of the Iron <b>Cross</b> and its higher {{grades were}} based on four {{separate}} enactments. The first enactment, [...] of 1 September 1939 instituted the Iron <b>Cross</b> (...) , the Knight's <b>Cross</b> of the Iron <b>Cross</b> and the Grand <b>Cross</b> of the Iron <b>Cross</b> (...) [...] Article 2 of the enactment mandated that the award of a higher class be preceded by the award of all preceding classes. As the war progressed, some of the recipients of the Knight's <b>Cross</b> distinguished themselves further and a higher grade, the Knight's <b>Cross</b> of the Iron <b>Cross</b> with Oak Leaves (...) , was instituted. The Oak Leaves, as they were commonly referred to, {{were based on}} the second Knight's <b>Cross</b> related enactment of 3 June 1940. In 1941, two higher grades of the Knight's <b>Cross</b> were instituted. The enactment of 28 September 1941 introduced the Knight's <b>Cross</b> of the Iron <b>Cross</b> with Oak Leaves and Swords (...) and the Knight's <b>Cross</b> of the Iron <b>Cross</b> with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds (...) [...] At the end of 1944 the final grade, the Knight's <b>Cross</b> of the Iron <b>Cross</b> with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds (...) , based on the last Knight's <b>Cross</b> related enactment of 29 December 1944, became the final variant of the Knight's <b>Cross</b> authorized.|$|R
5|$|For Washington is a 1911 American silent short {{historical}} fiction drama film {{produced by the}} Thanhouser Company. The film is a fictional account of how a patriotic maid's home is taken over by Hessian officers in the American Revolutionary War. She hides her hatred of them and plies them with drink before delivering a message to George Washington. She leads them in <b>crossing</b> of the Delaware River and the historic capture. The film's <b>crossing</b> scene was inspired by Emmanuel Leutze's Washington <b>Crossing</b> the Delaware. The film was praised by critics, but {{the notion that the}} film was purely a {{historical fiction}} was lost on some. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|If two {{disjoint}} smooth simple closed curves {{undergo the}} curve-shortening flow simultaneously, they remain disjoint as the flow progresses. The reason is that, if two smooth curves {{move in a}} way that creates a <b>crossing,</b> then at the time of first <b>crossing</b> the curves would necessarily be tangent to each other, without <b>crossing.</b> But, in such a situation, the two curves' curvatures at the point of tangency would necessarily pull them apart rather than pushing them together into a <b>crossing.</b> For the same reason, a single simple closed curve can never evolve to cross itself. This phenomenon is known as the avoidance principle.|$|E
