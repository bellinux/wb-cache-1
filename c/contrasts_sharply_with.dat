5|$|The first amniotes (clade of {{vertebrates}} {{that today}} includes reptiles, mammals, and birds) are {{known from the}} early part of the Late Carboniferous. By the Triassic, this group had already radiated into the earliest mammals, turtles, and crocodiles (lizards and birds appeared in the Jurassic, and snakes in the Cretaceous). This <b>contrasts</b> <b>sharply</b> <b>with</b> the (possibly fourth) Carboniferous group, the baphetids, which have left no extant surviving lineages.|$|E

25|$|In {{the same}} way as in the real case, the plane may also be viewed as the simplest, {{one-dimensional}} (over the complex numbers) complex manifold, sometimes called the complex line. However, this viewpoint <b>contrasts</b> <b>sharply</b> <b>with</b> the case of the plane as a 2-dimensional real manifold. The isomorphisms are all conformal bijections of the complex plane, but the only possibilities are maps that correspond to the composition of a multiplication by a complex number and a translation.|$|E

According to Aguirre, decisions to pursue small cases and ignore the much larger ones involving the financial elite are less the exception, than the rule and explain why Bernie Madoff was ignored for so long.|$|E

This <b>contrasts</b> <b>sharply</b> <b>with</b> other non-indigenous groups such as Germans, many of whom migrated to Germany after the breakup of the Soviet Union. South Korea never had any programme to promote return migration of their diaspora in Central Asia, unlike Germany. However, they have established organisations to promote Korean language and culture, such as the Korean Centre of Education which opened in Bishkek in 2001. South Korean Christian missionaries are also active in the country.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, Adrian Cronauer {{arrives in}} Saigon {{to work as}} a DJ for Armed Forces Radio Service. Cronauer is met at the airport by PFC Edward Garlick. Cronauer's {{attitude}} and demeanor <b>contrasts</b> <b>sharply</b> <b>with</b> many staff members. His show consists of irreverent humor segments and rock and roll, which are frowned upon by his superiors, Second Lieutenant Steven Hauk and Sergeant Major Phillip Dickerson. Hauk adheres to strict Army guidelines in terms of humor and music programming, while Dickerson is generally abusive to all enlisted men. However, Brigadier General Taylor and the other DJs quickly grow to like the new man and his brand of comedy.|$|E
25|$|In sheer numbers, {{they are}} {{reputed to be}} one of the most {{abundant}} of all macroscopic animals, with estimates of 100,000 individuals per square meter of ground, essentially everywhere on Earth where soil and related habitats (moss cushions, fallen wood, grass tufts, ant and termite nests) occur. Only nematodes, crustaceans, and mites are likely to have global populations of similar magnitude, and each of those groups except mites is more inclusive: though taxonomic rank cannot be used for absolute comparisons, it is notable that nematodes are a phylum and crustaceans a subphylum. Most springtails are small and difficult to see by casual observation, but one springtail, the so-called snow flea (Hypogastrura nivicola), is readily observed on warm winter days when it is active and its dark color <b>contrasts</b> <b>sharply</b> <b>with</b> a background of snow.|$|E

25|$|Physical {{expansion}} of the urbanized area in southern Florida is constrained by its location between the Atlantic Ocean {{to the east and}} the federally protected Everglades wetlands to the west. Though there is more land that can legally be developed before cutting in to Everglades National Park, Miami-Dade County has a politically defined Urban Development Boundary (UDB), which is only amended to allow further development after due process, with considerations such as population growth and amount and location of undeveloped land available within the UDB. This trend lends itself to increasing density within the urbanized area, with a focus on areas with transit; however, most of the expansions of the UDB are for low-density residential developments of less than five units per acre. This <b>contrasts</b> <b>sharply</b> <b>with</b> the downtown Miami area, where zoning allows development up to 1,000 units per acre, and zoning allowances are amended as the downtown area expands.|$|E
25|$|The Land of Oz as {{portrayed in}} the classic MGM musical movie of 1939, is quite {{different}} from that portrayed in Baum's books. The most notable difference is that in the film the entire land of Oz appears to be dreamed up by Dorothy Gale (thus making it a dream world), although, Dorothy earnestly corrects the adults at the end that she was indeed there, and an image of Dorothy's falling farmhouse returning to earth is presented. The apparent message is that one should appreciate one's home, no matter how dull it may look or uninteresting its surroundings may be, for having a home and a family is not something that should be taken for granted. This <b>contrasts</b> <b>sharply</b> <b>with</b> the books, in which Dorothy and her family are eventually invited to move to Oz due to a bank foreclosure on the farm, showing both that Oz is a real place, and that it is a utopia compared to the prairies of Kansas.|$|E
25|$|Other Shanghainese {{cultural}} artifacts {{include the}} cheongsam (Shanghainese: zansae), a modernization {{of the traditional}} Manchurian qipao. This <b>contrasts</b> <b>sharply</b> <b>with</b> the traditional qipao, {{which was designed to}} conceal the figure and be worn regardless of age. The cheongsam went along well with the western overcoat and the scarf, and portrayed a unique East Asian modernity, epitomizing the Shanghainese population in general. As Western fashions changed, the basic cheongsam design changed, too, introducing high-neck sleeveless dresses, bell-like sleeves, and the black lace frothing at the hem of a ball gown. By the 1940s, cheongsams came in transparent black, beaded bodices, matching capes and even velvet. Later, checked fabrics became also quite common. The 1949 Communist Revolution ended the cheongsam and other fashions in Shanghai. However, the Shanghainese styles have seen a recent revival as stylish party dresses. The fashion industry has been rapidly revitalizing in the past decade. Like Shanghai's architecture, local fashion designers strive to create a fusion of western and traditional designs, often with innovative if controversial results.|$|E

25|$|From a {{historical}} perspective, {{scholars in the}} Republic of Macedonia blame Greece for claiming ownership over an ancient kingdom which, in their unique and‚Äîin terms of internationally acclaimed academic scholarship‚Äîisolated view, was not Greek, claiming historical studies propose there was a considerable degree of political and cultural distance between ancient Greeks and Macedonians. This view <b>contrasts</b> <b>sharply</b> <b>with</b> that of Greek and international authors and scholars, who point to historical data seen as evidence that ancient Macedonians identified as Greeks and spoke Greek. Officially, the ethnic Macedonian claim to continuity with ancient Macedonia is based on Macedonia's population having mixed with the Slavic newcomers after their arrival in the 6th and 7th century, but having retained the Macedonian name, and elements of their traditions and culture. The name Macedonia continued in use as a geographical and political term throughout the Ancient, Roman, Medieval and Modern eras. The argument of legitimacy also extends {{to the view that}} much of today's Greek Macedonia was only fully Hellenised by political and military means in modern times. Since the division of Macedonia in 1913, Greece has carried out a policy of Hellenisation of the local population, forcing name changes, religious affiliation, and writings of church, frescoes and graves to Greek. During the Ioannis Metaxas era, Macedonians were deported or tortured for speaking or claiming to be Macedonian. Slavic-speaking Macedonians argue that they have a more legitimate claim to the name Macedonia to many Greek Macedonians, who are descendants of Greek immigrants and refugees that were settled in Macedonia from regions such as Anatolia, Epirus and Thrace during the early twentieth century.|$|E
500|$|From the {{beginning}} of the 1980s, Fodor adhered to a causal notion of mental content and of meaning. This idea of content <b>contrasts</b> <b>sharply</b> <b>with</b> the inferential role semantics to which he subscribed earlier in his career. [...] Fodor criticizes inferential role semantics (IRS) because its commitment to an extreme form of holism excludes the possibility of a true naturalization of the mental. But naturalization must include an explanation of content in atomistic and causal terms.|$|E
