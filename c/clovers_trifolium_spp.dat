40|$|Cyanogenic glycosides are {{substances}} {{present in}} many plants {{that can produce}} highly toxic hydrogen cyanide (HCN) or prussic acid. Specific plant enzymes released when plant cells are damaged when chewed, crushed, wilted, or frozen, hydrolyze the glycosides to cyanide. At least 2000 plant species are known to contain cyanogenic glycosides {{with the potential to}} produce HCN poisoning [1 - 6]. However, relatively few of these plants are frequent causes of cyanide poisoning in humans or animals because they are infrequent food sources for humans or animals [1, 2]. Plants that have been most frequently associated with cyanide poisoning in animals are listed in Table 1 - 1. Some of these plants are grown as food sources for humans and animals, for example, sorghum (Sorghum spp.), corn (Zea mays), <b>clovers</b> (<b>Trifolium</b> <b>spp.),</b> and manihot or cassava (Manihot esculenta), and can be used safely provided attention is paid to the circumstances under which these plants accumulate cyanogenic glycosides. Most plant-induced cyanide poisoning in humans occurs in tropical countries where cassava is commonly used as food. The chronic consumption of poorly prepared cassava diets produces a disease syndrome in humans known as tropical ataxic neuropathy [7]. Pigs and goats have been similarly poisoned when fed cassava tubers and leaves [8].

Among the plants it favours are the grasses Agrostis spp. and Festuca rubra, the yarrow (Achillea millefolium), <b>clover</b> (<b>Trifolium</b> <b>spp.),</b> dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) and buttercups (Ranunculus spp.). The voles choose species with high digestibility where possible and avoid some common plants amongst which they live such as the tufted hairgrass (Deschampsia cespitosa) and rosebay willowherb (Chamerion angustifolium). The animals have low energy reserves and these are only able to sustain them for five to fourteen hours. Because of the low availability of food in the winter, drier habitats are unable to sustain populations of much over two hundred animals per hectare.

40|$|Tropospheric ozone (O 3) is {{a potent}} threat to food security. In recent years, {{increasing}} evidence suggests that ozone can have large effects on the growth and functioning of grassland species, although the responses of grassland to ozone are complex and difficult to predict. Given the global ecological and economic importance of grasslands, there is a continuing need to research the effects of ozone on grassland and pasture. In this PhD project, the impacts of ozone on temperate managed pasture were investigated, primarily {{through a series of}} ozone-exposure experiments. Elevated ozone (seasonal mean concentration 30 - 67 ppb) was found to have large impacts on pasture vegetation, including injury and premature senescence, reduced biomass production, declining production and yield, and impacts on forage quality. Ozone impacts on nodulation and nitrogen (N) -fixation in legumes have not extensively been investigated, but could have important consequences for pasture sustainability, with predicted reductions in the root nodule biomass of <b>clovers</b> (<b>Trifolium</b> <b>spp.)</b> of 12 % or more in UK pasture. Ozone impacts on below ground biomass displayed a strong interaction with cutting, and intensive grazing could disproportionately increase the sensitivity of N-fixation in pasture to the effects of ozone. Flux-based ozone doseresponse relationships are constructed for biomass, total injury rates, N-fixation and forage quality in high-sugar ryegrass (HSG) pasture mesocosms, which could assist in the development of new critical levels for the protection of pasture vegetation...|$|E
40|$|Summary: The diet of brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula Kerr) {{in mixed}} {{hardwood}} forests on a central Westland hillside is described from analysis of plant cuticle fragments and seeds in their faeces. Faeces were collected monthly for 2. 25 years from animals live-trapped from low altitude forest / pasture margins through to high altitude alpine shrublands. The diet included forest and pasture foliage, buds, and fruits of over 100 species, although most were eaten infrequently. Foliage was taken most often from woody forest species (88 %), with three canopy species, kamahi (Weinmannia racemosa), southern rata (Metrosideros umbellata), and mahoe (Melicytus ramiflorus), providing 69 % {{of the leaf}} intake. Pasture species formed 12 % of the diet of possums living within 300 m of the forest edge, with 90 % of this being <b>clovers</b> (<b>Trifolium</b> <b>spp.)</b> and grasses. Fruit was taken {{from a wide range}} of forest species. Diet varied with sex, season, and altitude. Males ate more pasture foliage and less ferns than females and differed significantly in their use of many of the major woody species. Woody species were favoured most in winter and spring, ferns and fruits in autumn and winter, and pasture species in autumn. Pasture species were eaten only by possums denning within 1000 m of the forest/pasture margin, and high-altitude species by possums denning nearby. Only 15 forest species were eaten as much as or more than expected from their relative abundance. Ten of these species were frequently eaten, and the remainder infrequently, being locally rare. Preferred species showed clear evidence of possum browse and were often represented by many dead stems. This demonstrated the adverse effects of possums in such mixed hardwood forests...|$|E
40|$|The shading {{effects of}} radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don) trees on {{productivity}} and feeding value of nine-year-old cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata L) plus <b>clovers</b> (<b>Trifolium</b> <b>spp)</b> pasture on Templeton silt loam of medium fertility was measured under four light regimes in a sub-humid temperate climate at the Lincoln University agroforestry experimental area over four seasons from February 1998. The experiment was a randomised split-plot design with {{three levels of}} shade under trees as main plots and ± water applied to cocksfoot cv Grasslands Wana pasture areas with or without sheep urine patches as sub-plots in each of three blocks. In an adjacent open pasture plot of the same age, four sub-plots {{were randomly assigned to}} each of three blocks. Photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) measured under radiata pine trees was 18 % of full sunlight at 650 trees ha⁻¹, 40 % at 300 trees ha⁻¹ and 67 % at 200 trees ha⁻¹ compared with the ambient PPFD of adjacent open cocksfoot pasture. Tree shade reduced soil temperature at 100 mm soil depth in summer by 0. 9 - 1. 9 °C and increased it in winter by 0. 5 °C under moderate shade (40 % to 67 % PPFD) compared with open pasture with 20. 5 °C summer and 5. 8 °C winter mean temperatures. Likewise, volumetric water content (%) at 0 - 300 mm soil depth under 18 % and 40 % PPFD was significantly lower in late autumn, winter and spring seasons and higher during summer under 18 % PPFD. Under 40 % and 67 % PPFD there was more soil water only in January compared with open pasture which had 30. 9 % and 9. 8 % soil moisture in June and January respectively. Partial irrigation reduced soil temperature significantly in late spring, summer and autumn and increased soil water content in summer under trees by only 1. 3 % and in open pasture by only 0. 8 % compared with unirrigated plots. Botanical composition, expressed as percentage cover of nine-year-old Wana cocksfoot plus clover pasture along permanent transects in open pasture was 83 % cocksfoot, 4 % white clover, 1 % subterranean clover, 5 % weeds, 1 % dead material and 6 % bare ground compared with 74 % cocksfoot, 3 % white clover, 4 % subterranean clover, 4 % weeds, 5 % dead material and 10 % bare ground under trees with 67 % ambient PPFD. The five, 30 day production periods in March, June, September and November 1998, and February 1999 showed that cocksfoot pasture production at 18 % PPFD was reduced by 55 % even in irrigated urine and non-urine patches compared with open pasture. In this heavy shade, cocksfoot pasture productivity and feeding value was reduced by tree shade. However, under 40 % and 67 % PPFD pasture production without irrigation in urine and non-urine patches in the very dry 1998 / 99 season was reduced by 30 % and 21 % compared with open pasture which yielded 319 g DM/m² and by 16 % and only 1 % with irrigation (520 g DM/m² over the five months in irrigated open pasture). The apparent feeding value of shaded cocksfoot pasture was reduced because of changes in grass morphology (longer and thinner leaves) of shaded pasture which resulted in reduced pasture bulk density which may reduce pasture intake through smaller bite size. This possible adverse effect on intake together with reductions in the nutritive value (digestible organic matter, nitrogen and metabolisable energy) of shaded pasture could result in reduced per head animal performance. However, the small (4 %) increase of clover content and the decrease (29 %) in reproductive tiller numbers under 40 to 67 % PPFD may partially compensate these adverse effects in spring and early summer compared with open pasture. Results showed that cocksfoot pastures under moderate shade (40 % to 67 % PPFD) were more stressed by water and nitrogen than by tree shade because the addition of water and nitrogen (urine) under moderate shade gave large increases in pasture production, pasture bulk density and nutritive value compared with the nil treatment pasture areas...|$|E
40|$|Kabatiella caulivora is {{a serious}} {{pathogen}} of <b>clover</b> (<b>Trifolium)</b> <b>spp.</b> Subterranean <b>clover</b> (T. subterraneum) cv. Woogenellup was inoculated with K. caulivora, to study the attachment and germination of conidia, germ-tube penetration of the plant surface, and histochemistry and ultrastructure {{of changes in the}} host associated with lesion development. The foliar architecture caused the conidia to concentrate at the base of leaflets and on the petiolules (between the leaflets and petioles). Epidermal cells immediately beneath conidia and, occasionally, also adjacent cells developed a yellow-brown discoloration 1 day post-inoculation. Penetration appeared to be directly through the cuticle, characterized by constricted hyphae at the point of entry. No appressoria were observed. In leaves, invasion was restricted to the area proximal to the petiolule and leaf mid-rib. In petioles and petiolules, the hyphae initially remained between the epidermal cells and first layer of mesophyll cells before moving intercellularly through the mesophyll tissue towards phloem tissues. The cuticle was occasionally degraded in petiole and petiolule infections, the loss of epidermal and mesophyll cell wall components was detected, and chloroplasts and starch grains were disrupted. Plants developed macroscopic symptoms 10 - 11 days post-inoculation with necrotic lesions occurring on leaves, petioles and petiolules. Sporulation occurred approximately 15 - 18 days post-inoculation when affected plants collapsed.

A small increase in activity of PAL {{was recorded in}} both cultivars 2 – 4 h post inoculation with either race. A second, large increase in PAL activity was observed only in the incompatible interaction (cv. Daliak inoculated with race 1), increasing 18 -fold between 8 and 48 h post inoculation. Peroxidase activity in cv. Daliak increased rapidly within 2 h post inoculation with either race but was significantly higher in the incompatible interaction. Peroxidase activity in cv.

Subsequent increases in peroxidase activity were recorded in both cultivars, however the levels remained constant in cv.

It is hypothesised that the peak of activity of PAL at 48 h, and the rapid increase in peroxidase at 2 h {{are related to the}} race-specific resistance response of cv.

Plants of the tree-shrub layer and bog plants of the field layer together formed {{the main part of}} the diets of both cocks (75 % of fresh weight) and hens (58 %). Fragments of pine (Pinus sylvestris) and bil-berry (Vaccinium myrtillus) were more abundant in crops of cocks, whereas hens con-sumed more young herbaceous shoots and track-side plants. Hens also garnered spruce seeds (Picea spp.) from tracks. Track-side food items formed up to a third of the diet of hens. These included shoots of <b>clover</b> (<b>Trifolium</b> <b>spp.)</b> and especially flower buds of coltsfoot (Tussilago farfara). Complete elimination of some forest tracks, as a manage-ment technique for Capercaillie, could result in a loss of food sources important to hens in most of their Eastern-European range. The closure of tracks from people and vehicles, and their conversion to habitat where spring-blooming plants for hens abundantly grow, seems a more viable conservation option. Even in a highly disturbed area, plants of the na-tive taiga biotopes composed almost all the diet of cocks (ca. 97 %). Compared to the cocks, the feeding strategy of hens was more opportunistic; hence, their spring diet may be less vulnerable to logging perturbations. 1...|$|R
40|$|Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii is a soil {{bacterium}} {{capable of}} establishing a symbiotic relationship with <b>clover</b> (<b>Trifolium</b> <b>spp.).</b> Previously, the rosR gene, encoding a global regulatory protein involved in motility, synthesis of cell-surface components, and other cellular processes was identified and characterized in this bacterium. This gene possesses a long upstream region that contains several regulatory motifs, including inverted repeats (IRs) of different lengths. So far, the role of these motifs in the regulation of rosR transcription has not been elucidated in detail. In this study, we performed a functional analysis of these motifs using a set of transcriptional rosR-lacZ fusions that contain mutations in these regions. The levels of rosR transcription for different mutant variants were evaluated in R. leguminosarum using both quantitative real-time PCR and β-galactosidase activity assays. Moreover, the stability of wild type rosR transcripts and those with mutations in the regulatory motifs was determined using an RNA decay assay and plasmids with mutations in different IRs located in the 5 ′-untranslated region of the gene. The results show that transcription of rosR undergoes complex regulation, in which several regulatory elements located in the upstream region and some regulatory proteins are engaged.

Mountain quail consumed items from 61 plant taxa, but the bulk of their diet was composed of 13 major plant genera or species. Legumes were the most prominent food consumed by mountain quail. In the autumn, deervetch species accounted for 47 % of the total dry weight and were found in 58 % of the crops. Hairy vetch (Vicia hirsuta) constituted 38 % of the dry weight of crops collected during the winter and occurred in 50 % of the crops.

This study examines the anti-inflammatory effect of four honeys on wound healing, to gauge its efficacy {{as a treatment}} option. Isolated phenolics and crude extracts from manuka (Leptospermum scoparium), kanuka (Kunzea ericoides), <b>clover</b> (<b>Trifolium</b> <b>spp.),</b> and a manuka/kanuka blend of honeys were examined. Anti-inflammatory assays were conducted in HEK-Blue™- 2, HEK-Blue™- 4, and nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD) 2 -Wild Type (NOD 2 -WT) cell lines, to assess {{the extent to which}} honey treatment impacts on the inflammatory response and whether the effect was pathway-specific. Kanuka honey, {{and to a lesser extent}} manuka honey, produced a powerful anti-inflammatory effect related to their phenolic content. The effect was observed in HEK-Blue™- 2 cells using the synthetic tripalmitoylated lipopeptide Pam 3 CysSerLys 4 (Pam 3 CSK 4) ligand, suggesting that honey acts specifically through the toll-like receptor (TLR) 1 /TLR 2 signaling pathway. The manuka/kanuka blend and clover honeys had no significant anti-inflammatory effect in any cell line. The research found that kanuka and manuka honeys have an important role in modulating the inflammatory response associated with wound healing, through a pathway-specific effect. The phenolic content of honey correlates with its effectiveness, although the specific compounds involved remain to be determined.

Many non-native grass and forb species were introduced as a result of grazing and have since become widespread (Saenz and Sawyer 1986, Sugihara et al. 1987, Grenier 1989). Fire suppression, which began after European settlement, also contributed to a shift in species composition (Underwood et al. 2003).|$|R

Grasslands have declined substantially over the last 150 years, resulting in declines of many grassland birds. The dickcissel (Spiza americana), a neotropical migrant, is one such bird whose numbers have declined in the last 30 years due to habitat loss, increased nest predation and parasitism, and over harvest (lethally controlled as an agricultural pest on its wintering range in Central and South America). Reclaimed surface-mined lands have been documented to provide important breeding habitat for dickcissels in the United States, emphasizing the importance of reclamation efforts. Objectives were to understand specific aspects of dickcissel nesting ecology (i. e., nest-site selection, nest success, and nest parasitism, and identification of nest predators) on 2 spatial scales on TXU Energy?s Big Brown Mine, near Fairfield, Texas, and to subsequently provide TXU Energy with recommendations to improve reclaimed areas as breeding habitat for dickcissels. I examined the influence of nest-site vegetation characteristics and the effects of field-level spatial factors on dickcissel nesting ecology on 2 sites reclaimed as wildlife habitat. Additionally, I developed a novel technique to identify predators at active nests during the 2003 field season. During 2002 ? 2003, 119 nests were monitored. On smaller spatial scales, dickcissels were likely to select nest-sites with low vegetation, high densities of bunchgrasses and tall forbs, and areas with higher clover content. Probability of nest success increased with nest heights and vegetation heights above the nest, characteristics associated with woody nesting substrates. Woody nesting substrates were selected and bunchgrasses were avoided. Oak (Quercus spp.) saplings remained an important nesting substrate throughout the breeding season. On a larger scale, nest-site selection was likely to occur farther from wooded riparian areas and closer to recently-reclaimed areas. Nest parasitism was likely to occur near roads and wooded riparian areas. Results suggest reclaimed areas could be improved by planting more bunchgrasses, tall forbs (e. g., curly-cup gumweed [Grindelia squarrosa] and sunflower [Helianthus <b>spp.</b> ]), <b>clover</b> (<b>Trifolium</b> <b>spp.),</b> and oaks (a preferred nesting substrate associated with higher survival rates). Larger-scale analysis suggests that larger tracts of wildlife areas should be created with wooded riparian areas comprising a minimal portion of a field?s edge...|$|R

Was carried out by the Instituto Nacional de Investigação Agrária e Veterinária with Fertipadro company as partner. The main goals were the evaluation of five subterranean <b>clover</b> ecotypes (<b>Trifolium</b> subterraneum <b>spp.</b> brachycalycinum), two of pink serradella (Ornithopus sativus), two of yellow serradella (Ornithopus compressus) and one of biserrula (Biserrula pelecinus). Five commercial varieties of subterranean clover and one of pink serradella were sown for comparison with the new ecotypes. Dry matter production, crude protein, crude fiber and dry matter digestibility were evaluated. The results obtained seem to suggest that three of subterranean clover ecotypes and both pink serradella ecotypes present very promising production and qualitative characteristics, for the Mediterranean regio...|$|R

Proceedings of the Nutrition Society, 62, (2), 329 - 336. The declining consumption of ruminant products has been partly associated with their high proportion (but not necessarily content) of saturated fatty acids. Recent {{studies have focused on}} the less prominent fact that they are also important sources of beneficial fatty acids, including n- 3 fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acids. ?-Linolenic acid (18 : 3 n- 3) is of particular interest because it also contributes to improved flavour of beef and lamb. Many recent studies showed large effects of special concentrates on levels of fatty acids in milk and meat. However, the ?rumen protection? treatments, needed to ensure a worthwhile level of fatty acid in products, are expensive. Herbage lipids are the cheapest and safest source of these fatty acids and so breeding to increase delivery of fatty acids from plants into ruminant products is an important long-term strategy. Plant lipids usually contain high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly 18 : 2 n- 6 and 18 : 3 n- 3 which are the precursors of beneficial fatty acids. Whilst some plants are particularly rich in individual fatty acids (e. g. 18 : 3 n- 3 in linseed), there are also useful levels in grass and <b>clover</b> (<b>Trifolium</b> <b>Spp.).</b> Levels of fatty acids in forages in relation to species and varieties are considered, as well as management and conservation methods. Relationships between levels of fatty acids and existing traits and genetic markers are identified. The effects of forage treatments on the fatty acid content of ruminant products are reviewed. The higher levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids in milk from cows fed clover silages show that the level of fatty acids in herbage is not the only factor affecting levels of fatty acids in ruminant products. Further effort is needed to characterise susceptibility of unsaturated fatty acids to oxidative loss during field wilting and biohydrogenation losses in the rumen, and the relative importance of plant and microbial processes in these losses. The pathways of lipolysis and lipid oxidation are reviewed and other plant factors which offer potential to breed for reduced losses are considered. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Virus {{diseases}} {{are one of}} the most serious factors affecting yield adn persistence of leguminous crops. At present the only effective method of control is breeding for resistance. The first step in this process is selection of suitable resistant materials. Therefore, one of the main objectives of the present study were interactions between red <b>clover</b> (<b>Trifolium</b> pratense L.) and bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV) with respect to the selection and the methods of selection of initial breeding materials with a higher level of resistance to the virus. Similar interactions were also studied between alfalfa (medicago sativa L.) and alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV). The study also included the relationships between white <b>clover</b> (<b>Trifolium</b> repens L.), Persian <b>clover</b> (<b>Trifolium</b> resupinatum L.) and interspecific hybrids of the genera <b>Trifolium</b> <b>spp.</b> and Medicago spp. and some virus pathogens. In conclusion it can be said that the present study summarises the results from the tests of the interactions between forage legumes and the most important virus pathogens. The results may potentially be used and are now being used in breeding leguminous crops, predominantly red clover, for resistance to virus pathogensAvailable from STL Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|R
40|$|During late winter, 1994 and 1995, we {{investigated}} food habits and preferences of northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus; hereafter, bobwhites) collected on forested lands in east Texas. Crops for bobwhites {{were collected from}} areas under 3 management regimes, namely intensively managed for bobwhites (QMA) (i. e., tree basal area reduced, annually burned, numerous multi-stage food plots, etc.), extensively managed for timber and wildlife (NBS) (i. e., burned every 3 - 5 years, scattered 2 -stage food plots with corn feeders), and unmanaged for wildlife (i. e., burned every 5 - 7 years). With years pooled, partridge pea (Cassia fasciculata), Hercules club (Zanthoxylum clava-herculis), and pine (Pinus spp.) seeds, and <b>clover</b> leaflets (<b>Trifolium</b> <b>spp.)</b> comprised 93 % by weight of foods of 79 bobwhites foods on QMA. On NBS, 81 % of 40 bobwhite diets was butterfly pea (Centrosema virginianum), browntop millet, pine, wild bean (Strophostyles spp.), and corn seeds and clover leaflets; millet and corn were from food plots and feeders, respectively. For unmanaged areas, 79 % of 19 bobwhite diets was butterfly pea, rush (Juncus spp.), pine, partridge pea, and American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) seeds, and clover leaflets. Top-ranked food items on QMA were pine, hairy vetch, and Hercules club seeds in 1994 and butterfly pea, partridge pea, and wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera) seeds in 1995 (P < 0. 05). On NBS, hawthorn (Crataegus spp.) and beautyberry seeds were top-ranked in 1994 as were kobe lespedeza, wild bean, and butterfly pea seeds in 1995.

40|$|Wildlife is a {{valuable}} and renewable resource that promotes economical, ecological and social values. These values are important for developing and maintaining many rural societies. However, growing ungulate populations have led to increased browsing pressure on valuable forest trees and crops. Previous studies have proposed supplementary feeding and gamefields as potential methods for controlling the ungulate foraging and reducing browsing damage by providing other attractive food resources. However, quantitative estimates of potential biomass production of various gamefield crops and browsing pressure on the surrounding forest have been lacking. Within the thematic research program “Wildlife and Forestry” a three-year project was therefore initiated to evaluate marrow-stem kale, clover and rapeseed as gamefield crops together with browsing pressure in forests adjacent to the gamefields. In this study, the biomass production of <b>clover</b> (<b>Trifolium</b> <b>spp)</b> in a gamefield mixture has been evaluated on 8 gamefields sown in 2008 and 2009 {{in the study area}} Misterhult in southern Sweden. This was done with fenced plots and with associated control plots randomly distributed across the gamefields. Since clover leys are trimmed down during the season, the biomass assessments had to be conducted immediately before each of the trimmings, and one last time {{before the end of the}} vegetation period. Browsing pressure on the adjacent forests was investigated using four 500 -meter transects from each gamefield, one in each cardinal direction. Plots were laid out on the transects at distances of 0, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 meters from the game field. The study showed a high biomass production on gamefields. However, there were large variations in production between the gamefields, but also during the growing season. The study also showed large differences in biomass production between the gamefields sown 2008 and 2009. Gamefields sown in 2008 were able to produce between 100 grams and 656 grams and with a mean production of 304 grams dry weight of clover per m² with the current gamefield mixture during the growing season. This is equivalent to 3040 kg dry weight of clover per hectare. The corresponding clover biomass at the control plots was 48 grams and 331 grams dry weight per m². There were significant differences in available and grazed biomass. Game observations conducted during the fieldwork in the study area showed that the gamefields were frequented mostly by roe deer and hares, but also moose, fallow deer, red deer and wild boar. The study also showed that different deciduous trees and shrubs were present in varying degrees relative to the gamefields with higher prevalence in the border zones next to the gamefield. Browsing pressure in the edge-zones was high on most deciduous trees and shrubs but decreased with increasing distance from the game field with some exceptions. Maintaining an open landscape with browsed edges along with perennial and highly palatable crops on gamefields can provide opportunities to manage wildlife and browsing pressure in the landscape. In due course, this provides the necessary tools needed in an ecosystem-based wildlife management. ...|$|R
40|$|Cover crops {{have gained}} {{popularity}} in cereal cropping {{now that they}} are one of the subsidized options in agri-environmental schemes of the EU. Several studies on cover/catch crops affecting nutrient leaching have been published but less information is available concerning their applicability for weed management. In our opinion, combinations of crop and cover crop types as well as crop sequencing conform IPM principles and optimize weed management. The PRODIVA project (ERA-Net Core Organic Plus Action, www. coreorganicplus. org) aims at identifying weed community associations with most common crop types in organic crop production systems. We will clarify the characteristics and relative competitiveness of cover crops providing strong weed suppression without severely compromising weed species diversity and crop yields. Long-term cropping system experiments in Denmark, Finland and Latvia provide information on weed dynamics both in terms of weed biomass production and weed community associations with cropping factors such as crop type, crop sequencing and mechanical weed control. We aim at understanding the main factors driving weed pressure and weed community assemblies under northern European circumstances. Perennial weed species (e. g. Cirsium arvense, Elymus repens, Sonchus arvensis) are particular important in organic cropping systems because they heavily constrain crop productivity. Cover crop establishment and early growth are key factors for the suppression of weeds. Poorly developed cover crops can cause extensive proliferation of rhizomatous perennials. <b>Clover</b> species (<b>Trifolium</b> <b>spp.)</b> {{are one of the most}} applicable cover crops thriving in the Nordic/Baltic agroclimate.

40|$|Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii is a soil {{bacterium}} able {{to establish}} symbiosis with agriculturally important legumes, i. e., <b>clover</b> plants (<b>Trifolium</b> <b>spp.).</b> Cell surface properties of rhizobia play {{an essential role in}} their interaction with both biotic and abiotic surfaces. Physicochemical properties of bacterial cells are underpinned by the chemical composition of their envelope surrounding the cells, and depend on various environmental conditions. In this study, we performed a comprehensive characterization of cell surface properties of a wild-type R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii strain 24. 2 and its derivatives producing various levels of exopolysaccharide (EPS), namely, pssA mutant Rt 5819 deficient in EPS synthesis, rosR mutant Rt 2472 producing diminished amounts of this polysaccharide, and two EPS-overproducing strains, Rt 24. 2 (pBA 1) and Rt 24. 2 (pBR 1), under different growth conditions (medium type, bacterial culture age, cell viability, and pH). We established that EPS plays an essential role in the electrophoretic mobility of rhizobial cells, and that higher amounts of EPS produced resulted in greater negative electrophoretic mobility and higher acidity (lower pKapp,av) of the bacterial cell surface. From the tested strains, the electrophoretic mobility was lowest in EPS-deficient pssA mutant. Moreover, EPS produced by rhizobial strains resulted not only in an increase of negative surface charge but also in increased hydrophobicity of bacterial cell surface. This was determined by measurements of water contact angle, surface free energy, and free energy of bacterial surface-water-bacterial surface interaction. Electrophoretic mobility of the studied strains was also affected by the structure of the bacterial population (i. e., live/dead cell ratio), medium composition (ionic strength and mono- and divalent cation concentrations), and pH...|$|R
