He retained, however, his post of president of Czechoslovakia and his full membership on the Presidium of the KSČ. Miloš Jakeš, who replaced Husák as first secretary of the KSČ, did not <b>change</b> <b>anything.</b> The slow pace of the Czechoslovak reform movement was an irritant to the Soviet leadership.|$|E

The rest of the seven days, they did not withhold food or drink from him, but near nightfall on the eve of Yom Kippur, they would not let him eat much, as food might make him sleep. The sages of the court took him up to the house of Avtinas and handed him over to the elders of the priesthood. As the sages of the court took their leave, they cautioned him that he was the messenger of the court, and adjured him in God's Name that he not <b>change</b> <b>anything</b> in the service from what they had told him.

This led him to wonder, [...] "What if the person you expect to be the predator is not who you expect it to be? What if it's the other person?"

Deciding to let another designer work on the character that eventually became Mega Man X while he developed Zero, Inafune created the character intending him to be [...] "the 'other main character' that would [...] "steal all the good scenes". He further described Zero as representing the idea that [...] "nothing is absolute", and circumstances can <b>change</b> <b>anything.</b> When asked if Zero had killed the cast of the original Mega Man titles, suspected due to their absence in the X series, he replied no, adding that given how he had designed the character, [...] "Zero is not such a person--it is not in his profile." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{writing process}} {{consumed}} approximately six months, including three months creating notes and analyzing the novel. Zaillian noted that as time progressed, the writing accelerated.

[...] So with every decision that you make you are removing a whole bunch of other possibilities of where that story can go or what that character can do." [...] Given the book's sizable length, Zaillian deleted elements to match Fincher's desired running time. Even so, Zaillan took significant departures from the book. To Zaillian, there was always a [...] "low-grade" [...] anxiety, [...] "but I was never doing anything specifically to please or displease," [...] he continued.

Lidén no. 90. In a letter to Bäck, Linnaeus wrote that the thesis was mainly written by Petersen's father, as the Germans usually do. He writes {{that it should have}} been changed all over, or left as it was, and its language is very inflated. If Linnaeus had <b>changed</b> <b>anything,</b> he would have been blamed for that, for Petersen is rather malicious. In the dissertation, it is said that the temperature increases in the higher parts of the country, which is quite opposite the truth, and other similar things.

500|$|A workaholic, Kubrick rarely took a {{vacation}} or left England during the forty {{years before he}} died. Biographer Vincent LoBrutto notes that Kubrick's confined way of living and desire for privacy has led to spurious stories about his reclusiveness, {{similar to those of}} Greta Garbo, Howard Hughes, and J.

Michael Herr, Kubrick's co-screenwriter on Full Metal Jacket, who knew him well, considers his [...] "reclusiveness" [...] to be myth: [...] "e was in fact a complete failure as a recluse, unless you believe that a recluse is simply someone who seldom leaves his house.

[...] Lo Brutto states that one of the reasons he acquired a reputation as a recluse was because he insisted in remaining near his home, but the reason for this was because for Kubrick there were only three places on the planet he could make high quality films with the necessary technical expertise and equipment: Los Angeles, New York or around London.

For the most part, the team didn't want to redo any of the design {{elements}} from the first game, as they {{felt that there was}} no need to <b>change</b> <b>anything</b> that had already proved successful; instead, they opted to look for areas that could be improved and expanded upon them in a way that retained the base style of Knights of the Old Republic. Obsidian put much work into the game's graphics, including the appearances of non-player characters. Other technological improvements include the lighting and weather effects, in addition to increasing the level sizes.

500|$|When {{writing the}} script, Jordan {{had in his}} head an image of Samuel Beckett's play Krapp's Last Tape. The script was 27 pages long, instead of the normal average of about 65, {{due to lack of}} stage directions. Clive Arnold was asked to direct the episode, and was allowed to input more into the script than would be normal, which he said was due to his good working {{relationship}} with Jordan. Jordan also gave Brown the opportunity to <b>change</b> <b>anything</b> she wanted to. Arnold was careful that the episode would not alienate regular EastEnders viewers by making it too left of field, ensuring that it would be recognisable as an EastEnders episode, and made sure viewers would identify with the character, emphasising her state of mind with visual links. Brown found her lines for the episode easy to learn as they [...] "flowed" [...] and the script was well written. Arnold and Brown worked closely together, rehearsing and working on the script in detail. Rehearsals went on for a number of weeks and after being able to judge the pace of the episode, Arnold was able to introduce choreography and stage directions. He stated that the rehearsals were invaluable as he, Brown and Jordan could work together to develop and tweak the script as they progressed. He broke the script down into scenes to aid Brown's performance by giving her one scene to concentrate on per day of filming.|$|E
