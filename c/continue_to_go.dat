The United States had pressured Pakistan for a military operation in North Waziristan for years, and the US Congress linked military assistance to Pakistan for the next fiscal year with military operations in North Waziristan in June 2014. Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said that the Pentagon was unaware of Pakistan's decision to launch a new offensive in North Waziristan: [...] "The Pakistan military and the government understand the threat, and they <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> after that threat." [...] On 5 November 2014, Lt. Gen. Joseph Anderson, a senior commander for US and Nato forces in Afghanistan, said in a Pentagon-hosted video briefing from Afghanistan that the Haqqani network is now [...] "fractured" [...] like the Taliban. [...] "They are fractured. They are fractured like the Taliban is. That's based pretty much on the Pakistan's operations in North Waziristan this entire summer-fall," [...] he said, acknowledging the effectiveness of Pakistan's military offensive. [...] "That has very much disrupted their efforts in Afghanistan and has caused them to be less effective in terms of their ability to pull off an attack in Kabul," [...] Anderson added.|$|E

Along with this transformation of pairing comes insects, legendary creatures, and finally seven birds {{at the end of}} the fragment. The next section, [...] "Fragment B" [...] returns to the various animal pairs and, in a mixture of Old and New Testament figures, begins to rely on local animals or animals that pun off of aspects of the figure's life. One such example is a pun on Salmon and Salome as a pair for John the Baptist. This fish image [...] is further expanded to play off the idea that the Apostles were originally [...] "fishermen" [...] along with being [...] "fishers of men". This pairs <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on until the poem turns to creatures from Pliny at B245.|$|E

[...] Richard explained that O'Day's increasingly [...] "sexy look" [...] was alienating young fans. Referring specifically to O'Day's topless pictures for Complex magazine just a month before, Richard stated, [...] "We had just did a signing with Dollhouse Teen, which is for 13, 14-year-old young girls...

2500|$|Living for the Weekend {{garnered}} mixed reviews, with critics {{noticing the}} lack of personality and direction. Robert Copsey of Digital Spy called the album [...] "a compilation of perfectly serviceable pop" [...] but felt that [...] "as a group, the Saturdays sound lost." [...] Elliot Robinson of So So Gay wrote that the record [...] "occasionally perpetuate the more faceless dance pop its predecessor unfortunately introduced to the girls' sound" [...] and that it [...] "does feel rather calculated at times with some generic filler tracks." [...] However, he called it [...] "an enjoyable romp" [...] and [...] "an improvement over previous effort On Your Radar." [...] Christopher Toh of Today wrote that [...] "it’s not the best {{album of the year}} by any means, but it is great as background music for your weekend party, so in that sense, it works." [...] Another common criticism among reviewers was the difference in quality between the album's first and second half. Jon O'Brien of omg! noticed that [...] "like its predecessor, [...] {{the latter part of the}} record is virtually indistinguishable thanks to an over-reliance on the hands-in-the-air dance-pop that has dominated the charts since the rise of David Guetta et al" [...] and stated that [...] "if the Sats could have sustained the momentum of its opening half, then Living For The Weekend could have been a late contender for pop album of the year." [...] The reviewer of the Shields Gazette noticed the same problem, but found the second half [...] "inconsequential as opposed to horrid," [...] saying that [...] "it lacks personality in places, but it’s a better effort than many would expect from a group commonly [...] likened to a third-rate Girls Aloud." [...] Matthew Horton of Virgin Media noted that the album contains the band's [...] "best run of singles [...] ever," [...] but otherwise felt that it [...] "drags" [...] and that it is [...] "at least two tracks too long." [...] Angus Quinn of York Vision felt the same way, stating that the record [...] "really struggles once you're past the singles" [...] and that [...] "the album tracks could fit into almost anyone else's repertoire." [...] Patrick Gough of the Bournemouth Daily Echo found that [...] "the quality is strong and consistent for the first seven tracks, but after last year's single 30 Days, the songs become more generic" [...] and felt that [...] "the Saturdays have bags of charm and style but their identity gets a little lost towards the end of this album." [...] Darryl Sterdan of the Canadian Winnipeg Sun gave a negative review, describing the album as [...] "instantly forgettable pop, R and dance piffle about boys" [...] and saying that the band [...] " [...] best be living for the weekend, since that’s about as long as this will be on anybody’s playlist." [...] A more favorable review came from AllMusic's Matt Collar, who noticed that Living for the Weekend [...] "attempts to build upon the group's heightened profile with a bevy of infectious pop, soul, and electronic dance-club cuts that showcase the girls’ resonant vocal chops" [...] and described it as [...] "an album of delicious pop" [...] that [...] "goes a long way toward helping the Saturdays achieve their dreams of worldwide diva domination." [...] Daniel Falconer of female-oriented webzine FemaleFirst wrote that [...] "the Saturdays are the girl group of today, and <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> from strength to strength" [...] and awarded the album four out of five stars.|$|E
