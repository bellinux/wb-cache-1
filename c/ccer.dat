40|$|Paper {{prepared}} by TAC, the CGIAR Secretariat, and the Impact Assessment and Evaluation Group (IAEG) {{in response to}} a request to TAC by the CGIAR Consultative Council for ideas on the implementation of Recommendation 14 by the System Review Panel. The paper considers six sub-recommendations found in the System Review. It discusses impact evaluation; external program and management reviews (EPMRs) including Center commissioned external reviews (CCERs); stripe reviews; reviews of systemwide programs; special reviews; monitoring of center annual and medium-term plans; assessing the external environment; and reviews commissioned by members. There are three recommendations for consideration of the Group: establishment of a review and evaluation task force to work for a three year period, reaffirmation of the desirability of strengthening the evaluation culture in the CGIAR, and renewed efforts by centers, TAC and review panels to make good use of <b>CCERs.</b> The document concludes with a set of initiatives for TAC action.

40|$|The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) {{is one of}} the {{agriculture}} research centers of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), which is an informal association of over 50 members that supports a network of 15 international research centers in agriculture, forestry and fisheries. The CGIAR aims, through its support to the Centers, to contribute to promoting sustainable agriculture for food security in developing countries. Because the Centers constitute the core of the CGIAR, the effectiveness of ICRISAT and other Centers is crucial to the continued success of the CGIAR as a system. The CGIAR has established a tradition of external reviews to provide a mechanism of transparency and accountability to the members and other stakeholders of the CGIAR. The monitoring of quality of science is important to ensure that the Centers are producing transparent and quality research outputs that align with the agenda of the CGIAR. External Program Reviews (EPR) provide a measure of central oversight and serve as an essential component of the CGIAR’s accountability system. It complements the Center Commissioned External Reviews (<b>CCERs)</b> by providing a CGIARcommissioned comprehensive external assessment of the Center’s program and management, especially its relevance and quality of research and future directions. These reviews assess the mission, priorities and strategies, relevance and quality of science, effectiveness and efficiency of research leadership and program management and accomplishments and impact...|$|R

40|$|This {{strategy}} {{takes into}} account the new market opportunities being created for small-scale livestock producers by increasing local and global demand for high-quality livestock products (termed the Livestock Revolution) and the many pathways by which livestock has traditionally reduced poverty. Specific research programs address: 1 the vulnerability of livestock producers to income loss when their livestock assets are lost to disease or inadequate forage and water as well as their vulnerability to zoonotic diseases; 2 the challenge of sustainable intensification of smallholder livestock systems for increased productivity; and 3 the potential for sustainable increases in income from expanding markets for safe, high-quality, and affordable livestock products. In addition to coordinating the CGIAR Systemwide Livestock Research program, which enables all centres to collaborate in research on a range of cross-cutting livestock problems, ILRI pursues its research agenda through four inter-related projects relating to the outcomes. Project 1. Targeting and Innovation. Project 2. Improving Market Opportunities. Project 3. Biotechnology - Biosciences and bioinformatics for animal health and genetics. Project 4. People, Livestock and the Environment. Within each theme, research is implemented in three operating projects that focus on research outcomes in the medium term (58 years). These operating projects are further elaborated. Since its preparation of the 2008 - 2010 MTP, ILRI has continued to implement important initiatives that were highlighted in that MTP: establishment of the Biosciences east and central Africa (BecA) platform, alignment with ICRAF in corporate and research support services, expanded human resource capacity development; and others. Drawing on recommendations from the External Program Management Review (EPMR), partners, the Board of Trustees, and various Center-Commissioned External Reviews (<b>CCERs),</b> ILRI has, since the 2008 - 2010 MTP: sharpened the focus of Projects 1 and 4; reshaped its vaccine program; expanded its efforts in West and southern Africa and South/Southeast Asia; and closed research activities in Latin America, redefining its role in that region to support of programs led by others. The major changes in ILRI's portfolio since the 2008 - 2010 MTP are also highlighted. Changes from previous MTP Outputs are also summerised...|$|R

Weissman, by then the PER's vice president, was suspended from the bar association, following a review of his Romanian citizenship, with some 30% of the Romanian Jews being eventually stripped of their citizenship rights. The PER was again drawn into cooperation with the UER, issuing common protests against the measure, and reestablishing the <b>CCER.</b> It intensified support for emigration into Palestine, and organized the Totzeret Haaretz campaign (preferential imports from Palestine, and a boycott of Romanian merchandise). The latter policy, thought of by Filderman, effectively toppled the PNC cabinet in February 1938, but could not overturn antisemitic laws.|$|E
50|$|Crowd control (also called CC) is a {{term used}} in MMORPGs (Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games) and MOBAs (Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas) {{to refer to the}} ability {{to limit the number of}} mobs {{actively}} fighting during an encounter. It can also refer to abilities that influence or prevent the abilities or actions of other characters. Crowd control can be extremely powerful, controlling the possible outcomes of an encounter, as it forces opponents to use a smaller set of abilities/actions. Players use crowd control to create offense/defense ratio imbalances between themselves and their opponents; used properly, CC often renders an opponent nearly useless, allowing the <b>CCer</b> to use abilities/actions against an opponent without fear of retaliation or response. In a group setting, crowd control often makes combat safer, easier, or viable.|$|E

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of transition from the socialist planning economy to a market economy, China {{did not have a}} modern economics profession and the contribution of modern economics to China's transition was little. However, there has been increasing needs for modern economics education and research, as Chinese economy becomes more market oriented. To meet the needs, the China Center for Economic Research (<b>CCER)</b> at Peking University was built in 1994 with the initial supports and endorsement from the Ford Foundation and the World Bank. In the past 11 years, the <b>CCER</b> has expanded from six faculty members to 27 members, all with PhD training in economics from universities abroad, and become an important education and policy as well as academic research institution in China. Currently, the <b>CCER</b> provides undergraduate double-degree, MA and PhD in economics, MA in finance, and international MBA program to over 2, 500 students each year. The <b>CCER</b> is also active in policy consultations with the Chinese government and international organizations, in addition to its excellent academic publication records domestically and internationally. The CCER's success is attributable to its members' devotion, personal qualifications, democratic arrangements, commitment to education and independent research, outreaching, networking, continuous innovation, and service culture. In the coming years, the <b>CCER</b> plans to strengthen its PhD program by student exchanges with other universities abroad, initiate a NBER/CERP type network, and a consortium of similar institutions in other transition and developing countries.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Most of the {{molecules}} known to regulate left–right asymmetry in vertebrate embryos are expressed {{on the left}} side of the future trunk region of the embryo. Members of the protein family comprising Cerberus and the putative tumour suppressor Dan have not before been implicated in left–right asymmetry. In Xenopus, these proteins have been shown to antagonise members of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and Wnt families of signalling proteins. Results: Chick Cerberus (<b>cCer)</b> was found to be expressed in the left head mesenchyme and in the left flank of the embryo. Expression {{on the left side}} of the head was controlled by Sonic hedgehog (Shh) acting through the TGF-β family member Nodal; in the flank, <b>cCer</b> was also regulated by Shh, but independently of Nodal. Surprisingly, although no known targets of Cerberus are expressed asymmetrically on the right side of the embryo at these stages, misexpression of <b>cCer</b> on this side of the embryo led to upregulation of the transcription factor Pitx 2 and reversal of the direction of heart and head turning, apparently as independent events. Consistent with the possibility that <b>cCer</b> may be acting on bilaterally expressed TGF-β family members such as the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), this result was mimicked by right-sided misexpression of the BMP antagonist, Noggin. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that <b>cCer</b> maintains a delicate balance of different TGF-β family members involved in laterality decisions, and reveal the existence of partially overlapping molecular pathways regulating left–right asymmetry in the head and trunk of the embryo...|$|E
40|$|Dysregulation of brain-derived {{neurotrophic}} factor (BDNF), behavioral inhibition temperament (BI) and small hippocampal volume {{have been linked to}} anxiety disorders. Individuals with BI show facilitated acquisition of the classically conditioned eyeblink response (<b>CCER)</b> as compared to non-BI individuals, and a similar pattern is seen in an animal model of BI, the Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat. The present study examined the role of hippocampal BDNF in the facilitated delay <b>CCER</b> of WKY rats. Consistent with earlier work, acquisition was facilitated in WKY rats compared to the SD rats. Facilitated acquisition was associated with increased BDNF, TrkB, and Arc mRNA in the dentate gyrus of SD rats, but learning-induced increases in BDNF and Arc mRNA were significantly smaller in WKY rats. To determine if reduced hippocampal BDNF in WKY rats was a contributing factor for their facilitated <b>CCER,</b> BDNF or saline infusions were given bilaterally into the dentate gyrus region one hour prior to training. BDNF infusion did not alter the acquisition of SD rats, but significantly dampened the acquisition of <b>CCER</b> in the WKY rats, such that acquisition was similar to SD rats. Together, these results suggest that inherent differences in the BDNF system {{play a critical role in}} the facilitated associative learning exhibited by WKY rats, and potentially individuals with BI.

The MDG skilled birth attendant (SBA) strategy proved inadequate to end preventable maternal deaths {{for the millions}} of rural women living in resource-constrained settings. This equity gap has been successfully addressed by integrating a community-based emergency obstetric care strategy into the intrapartum care SBA delivery strategy in a large scale, northern Nigerian health systems strengthening project. The Community Communication Emergency Referral (<b>CCER)</b> strategy catalyzes community capacity for timely evacuations to emergency obstetric care facilities instead of promoting SBA deliveries in environments where SBA availability and accessibility will remain inadequate for the near and medium term. Community Communication is an innovative, efficient, equitable, and culturally appropriate community mobilization approach that empowers low- and nonliterate community members to become the communicators. For the <b>CCER</b> strategy, this community mobilization approach was used to establish and maintain emergency maternal care support structures. Public health evidence demonstrates the success of integrating the <b>CCER</b> strategy into the SBA strategy and the practicability of this combined strategy at scale. In intervention sites, the {{maternal mortality}} ratio reduced by 16. 8 % from extremely high levels within 4 years. Significantly, the <b>CCER</b> strategy contributed to saving one-third of the lives saved in the project sites, thereby maximizing the effectiveness of the SBAs and upgraded emergency obstetric care facilities. Pre- and postimplementation Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice Survey results and qualitative assessments support the <b>CCER</b> theory of change. This theory of change rests on a set of implementation steps that rely on three innovative components: Community Communication, Rapid Imitation Practice, and <b>CCER</b> support structures. Innovative communication body tools and the rote learning Rapid Imitation Practice training methodology enabled low-literate volunteers to saturate their communities with informed group discussions transferring communication capacity and ownership to the discussion participants. <b>CCER</b> is especially efficient because virtually every timely, community referral for emergency maternal care results in a saved life, whereas on average, only one in every eight births delivered by an SBA (12 %) {{is expected to be a}} delivery-associated complication requiring lifesaving care.

30|$|The {{results of}} the study show that we succeeded in {{designing}} a reliable and valid test instrument for assessing (prospective) VET-educators’ competencies in consuming empirical research. With regard to the competence structure, our results indicate that the two considered dimensions—frequently referred to in practical applications (e.g., Renkl 1994; Onwuegbuzie 2001; Dunn et al. 2007)—also become empirically evident. However, with the used approach, it cannot be excluded that empirically a model with more than two dimensions will fit the data better than with two dimensions. Existing finding of the LeScEd group assume a one-dimensional solution. We explain this deviation mainly on the basis of different test conditions (low-stakes vs. high-stakes testing) and a different handling of missing values. While under low-stakes testing conditions omitted items are often ignored (e.g., Groß-Opphoff et al.), under high-stakes testing conditions we have evidence that omitted items could be reduced {{to the fact that the}} participant does not know the answer. Despite the strong restrictions of the high-stakes testing approach (small sample size and a limited number of test tasks) the values of quality (wMNSQ and t values, assumption of equal discriminability, and test information curve) can be interpreted as sound; only the EAP/PV reliability shows moderate values. Based on the measures for the item quality, no item has to be excluded, and therefore our high standard of theoretically based content validity is fulfilled within the final item pool. In our opinion this positive result is attributable to our decision to follow ambitious standards for test designs and validation (Curriculum-Instruction-Assessment Triade, Evidence-Centered Design, high-stakes testing). But, this decision is also linked to the limitation that the study lacks generalizability, which constitutes a further crucial criterion of validity according to Messick (1995), but is not primarily being dealt with within this article. To provide a generalizable evaluation of prospective VET-educators’ <b>CCER,</b> it would be interesting to analyze how the test participants perform in <b>CCER</b> follow-up tests. Additionally, the test on <b>CCER</b> has to be implemented as a high-stakes testing exam for other research methodological training courses within different institutions and in different courses of studies which prepare future VET-educators. These institutions should comprise selected universities, whose module descriptions for courses on research methods we analyzed. The {{results of the}} <b>CCER</b> level model specification show that two of the three defined task characteristics (cognitive processes and complexity) are able to explain nearly 100 % of the prospective VET-educators’ <b>CCER</b> abilities. Besides the generalizability aspect, further limitations are (1) a constrained pool of items, (2) limited criteria for external validity, (3) constrained statements regarding the test fairness, and (4) the test focus on quantitative research methods: (1) Only a constrained selection of situations requiring <b>CCER</b> could be presented within the test. This is based on the high-stakes testing conditions in form of a real exam and on the limited test time. In future large-scale research designs additional <b>CCER</b> test situations—that prompt further statistical procedures (e.g. cluster analyses)—should be included for instance as a multi-matrix design. Furthermore, to measure also the abilities of very high-performing students sufficiently, items with a very high degree of difficulty have to be integrated into the test on <b>CCER.</b> (2) First indications for confirming the external validity of our test instrument are provided. However, in order to make a separate statement regarding the external validity of both scales (the conceptual and the statistical scale) for assessing <b>CCER,</b> external criteria for the two dimensions are necessitated. (3) Due to constrained possibilities for collecting demographic information under high-stakes conditions and related reasons of anonymity, the test fairness could only be examined for the covariate ‘gender’. (4) So far, <b>CCER</b> focus on quantitative research aspects. As a consequence, an operationalization of the qualitative part constitutes a crucial desideratum for further research.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Many {{pathways}} {{of carbon}} and energy metabolism are conserved across the phylogeny, but the networks that regulate their expression or activity often vary considerably among organisms. In this work, {{we show that}} two previously uncharacterized transcription factors (TFs) are direct regulators of genes encoding enzymes of central carbon and energy metabolism in the alp-haproteobacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides. The LacI family member <b>CceR</b> (RSP_ 1663) directly represses genes encoding en-zymes in the Entner-Doudoroff pathway, while activating those encoding the F 1 F 0 ATPase and enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and gluconeogenesis, providing a direct transcriptional network connection between carbon and energy metabo-lism. We identified bases that are important for <b>CceR</b> DNA binding and showed that DNA binding by this TF is inhibited by 6 -phosphogluconate. We also showed that the GntR family TF AkgR (RSP_ 0981) directly activates genes encoding several TCA cycle enzymes, and we identified conditions where its activity is increased. The properties of single and doubleCceR and AkgRmutants illustrate that these 2 TFs cooperatively regulate carbon and energy metabolism. Comparative genomic analysis indicates that <b>CceR</b> and AkgR orthologs are found in other alphaproteobacteria, where they are predicted to have a conserved function in regulating central carbonmetabolism. Our characterization of <b>CceR</b> and AkgR has provided important new insight into the networks that control central carbon and energy metabolism in alphaproteobacteria that can be exploited to modify or engineer new traits in these widespread and versatile bacteria.
