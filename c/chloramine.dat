25|$|The use of <b>chloramine</b> is {{becoming}} more common as a disinfectant. Although <b>chloramine</b> is not as strong an oxidant, it does provide a longer-lasting residual than free chlorine {{and it will not}} readily form THMs or haloacetic acids. It is possible to convert chlorine to <b>chloramine</b> by adding ammonia to the water after addition of chlorine. The chlorine and ammonia react to form <b>chloramine.</b> Water distribution systems disinfected with chloramines may experience nitrification, as ammonia is a nutrient for bacterial growth, with nitrates being generated as a by-product.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{evidence}} {{that exposure to}} <b>chloramine</b> can contribute to respiratory problems, including asthma, among swimmers. Respiratory problems related to <b>chloramine</b> exposure are common and prevalent among competitive swimmers.|$|E
2500|$|In {{swimming}} pools, <b>chloramines</b> {{are formed}} by the reaction of free chlorine with organic substances, such as urine and sweat. <b>Chloramines,</b> compared to free chlorine, are both less effective as a sanitizer and, if not managed correctly, more irritating to the eyes of swimmers. <b>Chloramines</b> are also responsible for the reported [...] "chlorine" [...] smell of swimming pools. Some pool test kits designed for use by homeowners {{are not able to}} distinguish free chlorine and <b>chloramines,</b> which can be misleading and lead to non-optimal levels of <b>chloramines</b> in the pool water.|$|R
25|$|<b>Chloramines</b> {{are often}} an {{unwanted}} side-product of oxidation reactions of organic compounds (with amino groups) with bleach. The reduction of <b>chloramines</b> back into amines {{can be carried}} out through a mild hydride donor.

40|$|The {{disinfectant}} {{potential of}} chlorine-ammonia compounds or <b>chloramines</b> was {{identified in the}} early 1900 s. The potential use of <b>chloramines</b> was considered after observing that disinfection by chlorine occurred in two distinct phases. During the initial phase, chlorine reducing compounds (i. e., demand) cause the rapid disappearance of free available chlorine. However, when ammonia was present bactericidal action was observed to continue [even though free chlorine residual was dissipated]. The subsequent disinfection phase occurs {{by the action of}} the inorganic <b>chloramines.</b> 6. 1 <b>Chloramines</b> Chemistry <b>Chloramines</b> are formed by the reaction of ammonia with aqueous chlorine (i. e., HOCl). Initially, <b>chloramines</b> were used for taste and odor control. However, it was soon recognized that <b>chloramines</b> were more stable than free chlorine in the distribution system and consequently were found to be effective for controlling bacterial regrowth. As a result, <b>chloramines</b> were used regularly during the 1930 s and 1940 s for disinfection. Due to an ammonia shortage during World War II, however, the popularity of chloramination declined. Concern {{during the past two decades}} over chlorinated organics (e. g., THM and HAA formation) in water treatment and distribution systems, increased interest in <b>chloramines</b> because they form very few disinfection byproducts (DBPs). 6. 1. 1 Equilibrium, Kinetic, and Physiochemical Properties <b>Chloramines</b> are formed from the reaction of chlorine and ammonia. The mixture that results may contain monochloramine (NH 2 Cl), dichloramine (NHCl 2), or nitrogen trichloride (NCl 3). When chlorine is dispersed in water, a rapid hydrolysis occurs according to the following reaction...|$|R
25|$|<b>Chloramine</b> must {{be removed}} from the water prior to use in kidney {{dialysis}} machines, as it would come in contact with the bloodstream across a permeable membrane. However, since <b>chloramine</b> is neutralized by the digestive process, kidney dialysis patients can still safely drink chloramine-treated water.|$|E
25|$|Ascorbic acid (vitaminC) {{and sodium}} {{ascorbate}} completely neutralize both chlorine and <b>chloramine,</b> but degrade {{in a day}} or two, which makes them usable only for short-term applications. SFPUC determined that 1000mg of vitaminC tablets, crushed and mixed in with bath water, completely remove <b>chloramine</b> in a medium-size bathtub without significantly depressing pH.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chloramine</b> can {{be removed}} from tap water by {{treatment}} with superchlorination (10ppm or more of free chlorine, such as from a dose of sodium hypochlorite bleach or pool sanitizer) while maintaining a pH of about 7 (such as from a dose of hydrochloric acid). Hypochlorous acid from the free chlorine strips the ammonia from the <b>chloramine,</b> and the ammonia outgasses {{from the surface of}} the bulk water. This process takes about 24 hours for normal tap water concentrations of a few ppm of <b>chloramine.</b> Residual free chlorine can then be removed by exposure to bright sunlight for about 4 hours.|$|E
40|$|During the {{production}} of high quality recycled water (HQRW) by means of reverse osmosis (RO) membrane filtration, <b>chloramines</b> (used to avoid biofouling) can generate disinfection by-products (DBPs) which could ultimately {{end up in the}} product water. This paper compares the fate of DBPs and organic halogen content generated during {{the production}} of HQRW under two different disinfection strategies employed prior to RO filtration: (i) in line-formed <b>chloramines</b> with a short contact time between secondary effluent and disinfectant versus (ii) pre-formed <b>chloramines</b> with a long contact time between secondary effluent and disinfectant. In general, pre-formed <b>chloramines</b> formed less trihalomethanes (THMs) in comparison to in line-formed <b>chloramines</b> even after a longer contact time. However, pre-formed <b>chloramines</b> still generated iodo-THMs (I-THMs) which are of concern since they are suspected to be more toxic than their chlorinated and brominated analogues. I-THMs were very effectively reduced by the advanced oxidation process placed after the membrane process. <b>Chloramines</b> also form other halogenated by-products whose identity is unknown. In this study, more than 95 % of total organic halogen formed by <b>chloramines</b> was rejected by the RO membranes although the reduction of targeted low molecular weight DBPs was only around 50 %. Specific rejections for individual DBPs vary, ranging from low for haloacetonitriles and high for haloketones...|$|R

5000|$|Chlorine {{reacting}} with urea in {{urine and}} other nitrogen-containing wastes from bathers can produce <b>chloramines.</b> <b>Chloramines</b> typically occur when an insufficient amount of chlorine {{is used to}} disinfect a contaminated pool. <b>Chloramines</b> are generally responsible for the noxious, irritating smell prominently occurring in indoor pool settings. A common way to remove <b>chloramines</b> is to [...] "superchlorinate" [...] (commonly called [...] "shocking") the pool with a high dose of inorganic chlorine sufficient to deliver 10 ppm chlorine. Regular superchlorination (every two weeks in summer) helps to eliminate these unpleasant odors in the pool. Levels of <b>chloramines</b> and other volatile compounds in water can be minimized by reducing contaminants that lead to their formation (e.g., urea, creatinine, amino acids and personal care products) {{as well as by}} use of non-chlorine [...] "shock oxidizers" [...] such as potassium peroxymonosulfate.|$|R
40|$|In most “real-world” {{applications}} of chlorine to aqueous systems, {{the interactions between}} chlorine and organic N-compounds are of concern {{in terms of both}} disinfection efficacy and analytical interference. The organic <b>chloramines</b> that are formed in these reactions are much less effective than inorganic <b>chloramines</b> in terms of antimicrobial potential. Conventional analytical techniques for “active” chlorine measurements have demonstrated potential interference by organic <b>chloramines.</b> Therefore, it is necessary to develop a more accurate technique for chlorination process control so as to provide adequate disinfection while limiting the toxicity associated with residual chlorine and DBPs. ^ A membrane introduction mass spectrometric (MIMS) method for differentiation and quantification of free chlorine and inorganic <b>chloramines</b> in aqueous solution was developed based on a low cost mass spectrometer. Several factors were examined for system optimization. Linearity of the response and limits of detection of all inorganic chlorine and <b>chloramines</b> were evaluated. System performance was evaluated with comparison of DPD/FAS titration from chlorination of ammoniacal water, aqueous solutions containing glycine and samples of potable water and wastewater. ^ The MIMS system was applied for purposes of studying the chlorination of aqueous solutions containing model organic N-compounds and pure bacterial cultural solutions. DPD/FAS pure bacterial cultural solutions. DPD/FAS titration was performed in parallel for comparison. DPD/FAS titration yielded false-positive measurements of chloroorganic N-compounds as “apparent” <b>chloramines,</b> while little or no inorganic <b>chloramines</b> were detected by MIMS. in the cases of model organic N-compound chlorination, the breakpoint chlorination curve shape and by-product formation were evaluated and found to be strongly dependent on Cl:N molar ratio, as well as the structure of the compounds. In the cases of bacterial solution chlorination, the results indicated that residual <b>chloramines</b> existed in the form of organic <b>chloramines</b> and the bacterial cells were the source of organic-N. The kinetic study showed a pattern in chlorination of the bacterial suspensions of rapid initial free chlorine consumption, followed by slow free chlorine consumption with trace quantities of inorganic <b>chloramines</b> being formed. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} study about the removability of four potentially harmful ozone-produced oxidants (free bromine, bromamines, free chlorine and <b>chloramines)</b> by activated carbon filtration was performed under identical conditions in small-scale filter experiments. Removability {{was high and}} similar among the oxidants {{with the exception of}} <b>chloramines</b> which showed the least removability. Results proved activated carbon filtration to be very efficient in removing the dominating brominated oxides formed during the ozonation of natural and most artificial seawaters. In contrast, removability of <b>chloramines,</b> sometimes present in ozonated bromide-free artificial saltwater, was shown to be significantly lower. To improve removal of persistent <b>chloramines</b> by activated carbon filtration, a comparative evaluation of 3 different activated carbon types was conducted. Granulated activated carbon on coal basis was suggested to be the most cost-effective carbon for removing <b>chloramines</b> as it possessed highest removal capacity, while being the cheapest of the carbons tested...|$|R

Twenty amino acids and two nucleic acid bases were chlorinated separately with sodium hypochlorite at a Cl:N molar ratio of 0. 4 : 1, and were {{then used to}} treat an E. coli suspension for 60 min. DPD/FAS titration was carried out to obtain the concentration of the chlorinated nitrogenous organic compounds {{as a function of}} time. In addition, membrane introduction mass spectrometry (MIMS) was used to quantify inorganic <b>chloramines</b> (mono-, di-, and trichloramine).

50|$|<b>Chloramines</b> pose {{a threat}} to aquatic {{ecosystems}} that are exposed to discharges of treated wastewater. Dechlorination with sulfite reduces the most refractory organic <b>chloramines</b> too slowly to produce wastewater effluents that meet current ecosystem protection criteria in the United States.
