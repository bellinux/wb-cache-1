5|$|Her {{armament}} {{arrived in}} Philadelphia missing electrical cables and with incomplete documentation, which required Cramp's electricians to piece things together themselves, for which <b>Cramp</b> charged an extra $50,000. She was launched on 23 October 1900 and ran her acceptance trials in October 1901. The trials were successful but revealed incomplete work that <b>Cramp</b> had to finish before {{he received his}} last payment. More work {{needed to be done}} on the armament, but it had to wait until she arrived in Russia. Retvizan was accepted on 23 March 1902, under the command of Captain Eduard Schensnovich who commanded her throughout her Russian service.|$|E
5|$|The Yorktown class gunboats—unofficially {{considered}} third-class cruisers—were {{the product}} of a United States Navy design attempt to produce compact ships with good seakeeping abilities and, yet, able to carry a heavy battery. Yorktown was authorized in the 1886 fiscal year, and the contract for her construction was awarded to the William <b>Cramp</b> and Sons shipyard of Philadelphia. The hull for Yorktown was designed by the Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair while the mechanical design was left to the <b>Cramp</b> yard. Yorktowns keel was laid on 14 May 1887.|$|E
30|$|Those with <b>cramping</b> or near <b>cramping</b> {{are more}} likely to have a prior history of muscle <b>cramping</b> during an ultramarathon and greater muscle damage during the event than those without <b>cramping.</b> Hydration status, intake rate of sodium in {{supplements}} and serum sodium concentration do not differ between those with and without <b>cramping.</b>|$|R
30|$|The key {{findings}} of this study are that (1) <b>cramping</b> and near <b>cramping</b> were common in this 161 -km ultramarathon; (2) the most commonly involved muscles were the calf, quadriceps, and hamstrings; (3) those with <b>cramping</b> or near <b>cramping</b> {{were more likely to have}} a prior history of muscle <b>cramping</b> during an ultramarathon and greater muscle damage during the race than those without cramping; and (4) hydration status, intake rate of sodium in supplements, and serum sodium concentration did not differ between those with <b>cramping</b> and those without <b>cramping.</b>|$|R
30|$|Prior {{work has}} {{demonstrated}} that muscle <b>cramping</b> is common in 161 -km ultramarathons [8]. Prevalence rates of muscle <b>cramping</b> during or within 6  h after an Ironman triathlon were reported at 23  % [5], and the prevalence rate was 41  % at a 56 -km ultramarathon [6]. While the present study {{did not include a}} post-race assessment for muscle <b>cramping</b> prevalence, and considered both <b>cramping</b> and near <b>cramping,</b> the 14  % prevalence of <b>cramping</b> and 41.1  % prevalence with inclusion of those with near <b>cramping</b> offer further support for this being a common phenomenon in ultramarathon running.|$|R
5|$|USS Conyngham (DD-58) {{was laid}} down by the William <b>Cramp</b> and Sons of Philadelphia in July 1914 and {{launched}} in July of the following year. She was the first U.S. Navy vessel named for Gustavus Conyngham.|$|E
5|$|Blakely {{was one of}} 111 Wickes-class destroyers {{built by}} the United States Navy between 1917 and 1919. She, along with 20 of her sisters, were {{constructed}} at William <b>Cramp</b> and Sons shipyards in Philadelphia using specifications and detail designs drawn up by Bath Iron Works.|$|E
5|$|Havana was {{launched}} in 1906 by William <b>Cramp</b> and Sons of Philadelphia for the New York & Cuba Mail Steam Ship Co. — {{commonly referred to as}} the Ward Line — as a passenger steamer on the New York to Havana route.|$|E
30|$|Runners {{developing}} muscle <b>cramping</b> {{during the}} ultramarathon were distinguished from those without <b>cramping</b> by more commonly having a prior history of muscle <b>cramping</b> during an ultramarathon and having higher post-race blood CK and BUN concentrations. A prior history of muscle <b>cramping</b> {{has previously been}} found to be a characteristic of those developing <b>cramping</b> during endurance events [5, 6], so this finding is not surprising. However, as far as we are aware, higher blood CK and BUN concentrations among those with <b>cramping</b> are new findings. While numerous factors account for variability in post-race blood CK concentrations, our interpretation of the finding that those with <b>cramping</b> had a higher blood CK relates to an association of muscle injury with relative exercise demand. In other words, we presume that the higher CK concentrations indicate that the group with <b>cramping</b> was placing greater demands on their muscles during the race relative to their current state of training than those without <b>cramping.</b> This provides additional support to the prior observation that those developing muscle <b>cramping</b> are racing at a relatively higher intensity than those without <b>cramping</b> [5, 6, 14] and that <b>cramping</b> in this environment may be due to muscle overload and fatigue rather than a fluid and/or electrolyte imbalance.|$|R
30|$|The {{questionnaire}} {{also asked}} {{whether or not}} the runner had experienced muscle <b>cramping</b> during prior ultramarathons and if they had had muscle <b>cramping</b> during this event, with answer options of yes, no, and “almost, but was able to control any full-blown cramping” (subsequently referred to as “near cramping”). The answer option of near <b>cramping</b> was included because we are aware that runners sometimes sense impending muscle <b>cramping</b> that can be aborted with various interventions, such as altering gait pattern. Those with <b>cramping</b> or near <b>cramping</b> were asked which muscle groups were involved and in which of the four course segments they experienced the <b>cramping.</b>|$|R
30|$|From this work, we {{conclude}} that muscle <b>cramping</b> and near <b>cramping</b> are common in a 161 -km ultramarathon, largely involve the most active muscles, and tend to occur after the early segment of the race. Compared with those not having <b>cramping,</b> those with <b>cramping</b> or near <b>cramping</b> {{are more likely to}} have a prior history of muscle <b>cramping</b> during an ultramarathon, and evidence suggests that they are placing greater demands on their muscles during the race relative to their current state of training. Hydration status, intake rate of sodium in supplements, and serum sodium concentration do not differ between those with and without <b>cramping.</b> Of the two main theories for the pathophysiology of exercise-associated muscle <b>cramping,</b> the present findings support a muscle fatigue basis for muscle <b>cramping</b> during ultra-endurance exercise over the theory based on hyperexcitability of motor neuron axon terminals due to an electrolyte or fluid imbalance.|$|R
5|$|He won the 100m at the Commonwealth Games {{trials in}} a season's best of 10.03s, then equalled Linford Christie's record of 10.04s at European Cup, where {{he led the}} British team to victory as team captain. Victories over Maurice Greene {{followed}} at Oslo's IAAF Golden League meeting and in Sheffield with a wind-assisted 9.95s. He was the favourite for the 2002 Commonwealth Games, but Chambers faced stiff competition from British newcomer Mark Lewis-Francis who was finishing fractions of a second behind him. Chambers won all his preliminary races and reached the final, along with Lewis-Francis and Jason Gardener, but he suffered a <b>cramp</b> mid-race {{and ended up in}} last place. He later revealed that he had feigned injury as the brief hamstring <b>cramp</b> was caused by drug abuse. The English sprinters had the three slowest times in the final, with Lewis-Francis also beset by injury.|$|E
5|$|Saratoga was {{launched}} in March 1907 by William <b>Cramp</b> and Sons, Philadelphia, for the Ward Line of New York. The ship was placed in service later that year on the New York to Havana route where she stayed {{for the next ten}} years. She was considered by some as the fastest steamship in the coastal trade.|$|E
5|$|South Carolinas {{trials were}} {{conducted}} off the Delaware Capes beginning on 24 August 1909, and its standardization runs were slightly faster than Michigans. After final modifications at William <b>Cramp,</b> South Carolina was commissioned on 1 March 1910 and departed for a shakedown cruise six days later.|$|E
30|$|Prior {{studies of}} muscle <b>cramping</b> {{associated}} with endurance activities up to ~ 18  h {{have shown a}} higher likelihood of <b>cramping</b> among those with a prior history of <b>cramping</b> [5, 6] and those racing at a relatively higher intensity [5, 6, 14]. Muscle <b>cramping</b> has not been related to serum sodium concentration [5, 15 – 17]. The {{purpose of this study}} was to learn about muscle <b>cramping</b> during an ultramarathon lasting up to 30  h, including the prevalence, muscle groups involved, distance at which <b>cramping</b> tends to occur, characteristics of those who have muscle <b>cramping,</b> and whether muscle <b>cramping</b> is related to weight change, sodium supplementation, post-race serum sodium, or extent of muscle injury as defined by serum creatine kinase (CK) concentration. It was anticipated that this new information would offer additional insight into the underlying pathophysiology of exercise-associated muscle <b>cramping</b> in this environment. Based on prior findings from endurance events [2 – 6, 8, 15 – 18], we hypothesized that muscle <b>cramping</b> would be common and more likely among those with a prior history of muscle <b>cramping</b> and is unrelated to hydration status, intake rate of sodium in supplements, or post-race serum sodium concentration.|$|R
30|$|The present {{findings}} offer {{some insight into}} the underlying pathophysiology of exercise-associated muscle <b>cramping.</b> Key findings in this regard were that (1) the <b>cramping</b> involved muscle groups under high demand during the activity; (2) <b>cramping</b> appeared most prevalent, though not statistically different, after the early portion of the race; (3) those with <b>cramping</b> had higher blood CK concentrations than those without cramping; and (4) <b>cramping</b> was not related to serum sodium concentration or hydration status. Considering the two main theories for the pathophysiology of exercise-associated muscle <b>cramping,</b> these findings seem most consistent with muscle fatigue as an underlying mechanism for muscle <b>cramping</b> in this environment rather than an electrolyte or fluid balance issue.|$|R
50|$|Because of the microcirculatory distress, a {{telltale}} sign or {{symptom of}} a potential sickling collapse is <b>cramping.</b> Specifically to sickle cell trait, <b>cramping</b> occurs in the lower extremities and back in athletes undergoing intense physical activity or exertion. In comparison to heat <b>cramps,</b> sickling <b>cramps</b> are less intense in terms of pain and have a weakness and fatigue associated with them, as opposed to tightly contracted muscles that lock up during heat <b>cramps.</b>|$|R
5|$|USS O'Brien (Destroyer No. 51/DD-51) {{was laid}} down by William <b>Cramp</b> and Sons of Philadelphia in September 1913 and {{launched}} in July 1914.

5|$|USS Porter (DD-59) {{was laid}} down by the William <b>Cramp</b> and Sons of Philadelphia in August 1914 and {{launched}} in August of the following year. She was the second U.S. Navy vessel {{named in honor of}} both David Porter and his son David Dixon Porter.|$|E
5|$|SS Oriente was a {{combination}} cargo and passenger vessel built by William <b>Cramp</b> and Sons, Philadelphia, for the Ward Line. In mid-1917 the United States Shipping Board (USSB) commandeered and received title to all private shipbuilding projects in progress, including the still-incomplete Oriente and her sister ship Orizaba. Plans for both ships were modified for troop carrying duties. Oriente was launched on 15August 1917, renamed Siboney on 28February 1918, delivered to the navy on 8April, and commissioned the same day, Commander A.T. Graham in command.|$|E
50|$|Exercise-associated muscle <b>cramps</b> (EAMC) {{are defined}} as <b>cramping</b> (painful muscle spasms) during or {{immediately}} following exercise. Muscle <b>cramps</b> during exercise are very common, even in elite athletes. EAMC are a common condition that occurs during or after exercise, often during endurance events such as a triathlon or marathon. Although EAMC are extremely common among athletes, the cause is still not fully understood because muscle <b>cramping</b> can occur {{as a result of}} many underlying conditions. Elite athletes experience <b>cramping</b> due to paces at higher intensities. The cause of exercise-associated muscle <b>cramps</b> is hypothesized to be due to altered neuromuscular control, dehydration, or electrolyte depletion.|$|R
30|$|Runners {{developing}} muscle <b>cramping</b> {{during the}} ultramarathon {{did not have}} a statistically different post-race serum sodium compared with those without <b>cramping,</b> but the statistical effect was close to significant (p[*]=[*] 0.055). To further investigate whether a low serum sodium (below the reference range for normal of 135 – 145  mmol/L) might be linked to a higher incidence of <b>cramping,</b> we performed additional analyses. The serum sodium concentration among those with <b>cramping,</b> near <b>cramping,</b> and no <b>cramping</b> during the final segment of the race was compared and found to not be different. We also compared the proportion of runners with serum sodium concentrations below normal among those with <b>cramping</b> or near <b>cramping</b> and those without <b>cramping</b> during the final segment of the race and found no difference between groups. These analyses were performed under the presumption that the serum sodium concentration at the finish would relate best to any symptoms during the final segment of the race. Given the findings from these analyses, we conclude that <b>cramping</b> is not related to serum sodium concentration in this environment, a conclusion that supports prior studies of runners and triathletes [5, 15 – 17].|$|R

5|$|Scott broke George Pinkney's MLB {{consecutive}} games played streak of 577 on April 26, 1920. He again led AL shortstops in fielding percentage. The Red Sox named Scott team captain for the 1921 season, after the previous captain, Harry Hooper, {{was traded to}} the Chicago White Sox. During spring training in 1921, Scott dealt with leg <b>cramp</b> that threatened his playing streak, but he was able to continue playing. Scott had 62 runs batted in on the season, and stated that it was his goal to play in 1,000 {{consecutive games}}.|$|E
5|$|Two genetic health {{concerns}} {{seen in the}} breed are von Willebrand disease (vWD) and craniomandibular osteopathy (CMO); Scottie <b>cramp,</b> patellar luxation and cerebellar abiotrophy are also sometimes seen in this breed. Common eye conditions seen {{in a variety of}} breeds such as cataracts and glaucoma can appear in Scotties as they age. There are no specific conditions relating the skin that affect the breed, but they can be affected by common dog related conditions such as parasites and mange. Scotties typically live from 11 to 13 years.|$|E
5|$|USS Nicholson (Destroyer No. 52/DD-52) {{was laid}} down by William <b>Cramp</b> and Sons of Philadelphia in September 1913 and {{launched}} in August 1914. The ship was the second U.S. Navy vessel {{named in honor of}} five members of the Nicholson family who gave distinguished service in the American Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, and the American Civil War: brothers James, Samuel, and John Nicholson; William Nicholson, son of John; and James W.

30|$|The post-race {{questionnaire}} {{was completed by}} 280 (74.5  %) of the 376 starters. A post-race blood sample was provided by 181 (61.1  %) of the 296 finishers, and 157 (53.0  %) of finishers completed the post-race survey and also provided a post-race blood sample. Among those who completed the survey, the prevalence of <b>cramping</b> and near <b>cramping</b> was 14.3 and 26.8  %, respectively, with greatest involvement being in the calf (54  %), quadriceps (44  %), and hamstring (33  %) muscles. Those with <b>cramping</b> or near <b>cramping</b> {{were more likely to}} have a prior history of muscle <b>cramping</b> during an ultramarathon (p[*]<[*] 0.0001) and had higher blood CK concentrations (p[*]=[*] 0.001) than those without <b>cramping.</b> Weight change during the race, use of sodium supplements, intake rate of sodium in supplements, and post-race serum sodium concentration did not differ between those with and without <b>cramping.</b>|$|R
30|$|Muscle <b>cramping</b> is {{most common}} in those with a prior history of <b>cramping</b> and greater muscle damage during an ultramarathon, {{suggesting}} an association with relative muscular demand. Impaired fluid and sodium balance {{did not appear to}} be an etiology of muscle <b>cramping</b> during an ultramarathon.|$|R
30|$|Post-race serum sodium {{was further}} {{compared}} {{among those with}} <b>cramping</b> (mean[*]±[*]SD value 138 [*]±[*] 5  mmol/L), near <b>cramping</b> (140 [*]±[*] 4  mmol/L), and no <b>cramping</b> (140 [*]±[*] 3  mmol/L) during the last segment of the race and was found to not be different among groups (p[*]=[*] 0.51). Additionally, the proportion of runners with a serum sodium concentration at the finish below 135  mmol/L (reference range for normal is 135 – 145  mmol/L) was similar (p[*]=[*] 0.43) for those with <b>cramping</b> or near <b>cramping</b> (11.5  %) and those without <b>cramping</b> (7.0  %) during the final segment of the race, and the serum sodium concentrations for these two groups (range 125 – 133 and 131 – 134  mmol/L, respectively) were also similar (p[*]=[*] 0.16).|$|R
5|$|Balch was {{authorized}} in March 1911 {{as the last}} of four ships of the , which was almost identical to the s authorized at the same time. Construction of the vessel—like her three sister ships—was awarded to William <b>Cramp</b> and Sons of Philadelphia which laid down her keel on 7 May 1912. On 21 December, Balch was launched by sponsor Miss Grace Balch, daughter of the ship's namesake, George Beale Balch. The ship was the first U.S. Navy ship named for Balch, a US Navy officer who served in the Mexican-American War and the American Civil War and, as a rear admiral, served as Superintendent of United States Naval Academy from 1879–81.|$|E
5|$|Blakeley was {{launched}} 19 September 1918 by William <b>Cramp</b> and Sons Ship and Engine Building Company in Philadelphia and {{sponsored by the}} wife of Charles Adams Blakeley. The ship was commissioned 8 May 1919, {{under the command of}} Commander W. Brown, Jr.. She immediately joined the Atlantic Fleet. Blakely patrolled along the East Coast of the United States until she was decommissioned on 29 June 1922, and returned to Philadelphia. She was recommissioned from 1932 to 1937 to serve with the Scouting Fleet, and then was again decommissioned in Philadelphia. Low military budgets were the cause of these periods of inactivity, as the Navy did not have the funds or manpower to maintain a number of ships, including Blakeley.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool got {{the first}} half of extra time under way, but the start was slow as players {{suffered}} with <b>cramp,</b> Carragher in particular. In the 97th minute, Liverpool won a corner, which West Ham cleared to Liverpool defender John Arne Riise {{on the edge of the}} penalty area, but his shot went over the crossbar. Liverpool won another corner in the 99th minute, which was cleared by West Ham; the ball came back into the penalty area and Morientes headed down for Cissé, but he was unable to control the ball. Before the end of the half, Hyypiä had a chance to score after running past Scaloni and Harewood, but his shot went wide of the West Ham goal.|$|E
5000|$|Heat <b>cramps</b> are painful, often severe, {{involuntary}} spasms of {{the large}} muscle groups used in strenuous exercise. Heat <b>cramps</b> tend to occur after intense exertion. They usually develop in people performing heavy exercise while sweating profusely and replenishing fluid loss with non-electrolyte containing water. This is believed to lead to hyponatremia that induces <b>cramping</b> in stressed muscles. Rehydration with salt-containing fluids provides rapid relief. Patients with mild <b>cramps</b> can be given oral [...]2% salt solutions, while those with severe <b>cramps</b> require IV isotonic fluids.
