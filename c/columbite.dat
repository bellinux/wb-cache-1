5|$|Tantalum, always {{together}} with the chemically similar niobium, occurs in the minerals tantalite, <b>columbite</b> and coltan (a mix of <b>columbite</b> and tantalite).|$|E
5|$|Tantalum is {{estimated}} to make up about 1ppm or 2ppm of the Earth's crust by weight. There are many species of tantalum minerals, only {{some of which are}} so far being used by industry as raw materials: tantalite, microlite, wodginite, euxenite, polycrase. Tantalite (Fe, Mn)Ta2O6 is the most important mineral for tantalum extraction. Tantalite has the same mineral structure as <b>columbite</b> (Fe, Mn) (Ta, Nb)2O6; when there is more tantalum than niobium it is called tantalite and when there is more niobium than tantalum is it called <b>columbite</b> (or niobite). The high density of tantalite and other tantalum containing minerals makes the use of gravitational separation the best method. Other minerals include samarskite and fergusonite.|$|E
5|$|Niobium was {{identified}} by English chemist Charles Hatchett in 1801. He {{found a new}} element in a mineral sample that {{had been sent to}} England from Connecticut, United States in 1734 by John Winthrop F.R.S. (grandson of John Winthrop the Younger) and named the mineral <b>columbite</b> and the new element columbium after Columbia, the poetical name for the United States. The columbium discovered by Hatchett was probably a mixture of the new element with tantalum.|$|E

40|$|The {{pattern of}} minor {{elements}} incorporation in <b>columbites</b> from granitic pegmatites of Alto Ligonha, Mozambique, was disclosed {{on the basis}} of synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence (SRXRF) data. Major elements (Fe, Mn, Nb, Ta) were analyzed with an electron microprobe (EPMA). Minor and trace element contents display a common general trend pointing towards the preferential uptake of metals that minimize the stress induced in the host crystal structure by the non-commensurability of cations with distinct valences and ionic radii. The simultaneous incorporation of Ti, Zr, U, Pb, Y and W assures electrostatic equilibrium, being conditioned by the dominant presence of niobium, while Sc concentrates in solid solutions with low Nb/(Nb+Ta) ratios...|$|R
40|$|The Early Triassic marine {{deposits}} {{are distributed}} {{over a large}} area in the Western United State and are very rich in ammonoids. The detailed bed by bed study of their stratigraphic distribution allowed us to present a new very precise biochronological framework of the Spathian stage (Middle to Late Olenekian). Nineteen new ammonoid species belonging to the genera Pseudosvalbardiceras ?, Prohungarites, Silberlingeria, Bajarunia, Hemilecanites, Arctomeekoceras, Xenoceltites, Nordophiceratoides, Sibirites, <b>Columbites,</b> Hellenites and Svalbardiceras and eighteen new spathian ammonoid genera (Courtilloticeras, Yvesgalleticeras, Marcouxia, Jeanbesseiceras, Tapponnierites, Gaudemerites, Deweveria, Ceccaisculitoides, Coscaites, Eschericeratites, Carteria, Goricanites, Tardicolumbites, Cowboyiceras, Nordophiceratoides, Glabercolumbites) have been described in a recent preliminary report by Guex et al. (2005) {{on the basis of}} unpublished material collected in the western USA (Idaho, Utah, Nevada and California). In addition, one new genus (Rudolftruempyiceras) and four new species are also described in the present work. The precise stratigraphic description of the collected sections is given in the present Memoir and the stratigraphic distribution of 88 species belonging to 51 genera is established herein. Twenty-three new biochronological horizons are defined thanks to these new data. The Cowboy Pass section (Utah) records a very interesting terrestrial (red beds and very shallow water deposits) transition between the marine Late Smithian and the Earliest Spathian faunas. That worldwide short lived regression followed by a major transgression fits the model proposed by Guex et al. 2001 and Morard et al. 2003 for the Pliensbachian - Toarcian transition: major volcanic SO 2 emissions generating a short but major cooling and glaciation associated with an important sea level fall and large scale emersions, followed by a warming inducing a transgressive episode with some anoxic deposits...|$|R
5|$|Niobium, {{formerly}} columbium, is {{a chemical}} element with symbol Nb (formerly Cb) and atomic number 41. It is a soft, grey, ductile transition metal, {{often found in}} the minerals pyrochlore (the main commercial source for niobium) and <b>columbite.</b> Its name comes from Greek mythology, specifically Niobe, who {{was the daughter of}} Tantalus, the namesake of tantalum. The name reflects the great similarity between the two elements in their physical and chemical properties, making them difficult to distinguish.|$|E

500|$|German chemists Walter Noddack, Otto Berg, and Ida Tacke {{reported}} {{the discovery of}} element75 and element43 in 1925, and named element43 masurium (after Masuria in eastern Prussia, now in Poland, the region where Walter Noddack's family originated). The group bombarded <b>columbite</b> with a beam of electrons and deduced element43 was present by examining X-ray diffraction spectrograms. The wavelength of the X-rays produced {{is related to the}} atomic number by a formula derived by Henry Moseley in 1913. The team claimed to detect a faint X-ray signal at a wavelength produced by element43. Later experimenters could not replicate the discovery, and it was dismissed as an error for many years. Still, in 1933, a series of articles on the discovery of elements quoted the name masurium for element43. [...] Whether the 1925 team actually did discover element43 is still debated.|$|E
40|$|Nb and Ta are geochemically related {{elements}} {{which typically}} {{give rise to}} isomorphous series of oxides as accessory minerals in granitic pegmatites (e. g. <b>columbites,</b> pyrochlores, fergusonites, etc). However, {{in spite of the}} natural occurrence of orthorhombic alumotantite (AlTaO 4), its Nb counterpart is only known as a synthetic product. AlNbO 4 crystallizes with monoclinic symmetry (s. g. C 2 /m) and was early described with a strict ordering of Nb and Al, respectively over M 1 and M 2, the two non-equivalent octahedral sites in the structure [1]. This model was revised by successive refinements showing that a partial disorder occurs in AlNbO 4 with a ~ 20 % inversion degree [2, 3]. CrNbO 4 is a disordered MM'O 4 compound, crystallizing with the rutile structure (s. g. P 42 mnm) while FeNbO 4 crystallizes with wolframite (s. g. P 2 /c), orthorhombic α-PbO 2 -type, rutile, or AlNbO 4 -type structure as the temperature increases. This brief review shows that, even at room conditions, the chemical nature of the metal cations M 3 + strongly affects the crystal structure of MM'O 4 -type oxides. In order to better understand the substitution mechanisms, the cationic ordering, the structural stability, and the phase transition processes for (M 3 +) (Nb 5 +) O 4 compounds, six samples along the (Al 1 -xCrx) NbO 4 join (x: 0. 0 – 0. 5) were synthesized by the solid-state reaction process and investigated by means of a X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and electron absorption spectroscopy (EAS) combined approach. Monophasic up to x(Cr) = 0. 125 apfu (AlNbO 4 -type structure), the samples along the join become biphasic (the former plus the CrNbO 4 -type structure) for x(Cr) > 0. 125 apfu, indicating the impossibility to have a complete solid solution between (Al,Cr) NbO 4 oxides. The lattice parameters increasing with the Al–Cr substitution defines a structural expansion limit (x(Cr) > 0. 24 apfu) that is ascribed to the maximum chromium content that the structure can accept. The samples up to x(Cr) = 0. 25 also exhibit the typical optical spectra of Cr 3 + in 6 -fold coordination, involving d-d electronic transitions. Ascertained that the proposed octahedral ordering models were corrected [2, 3], through different refinement strategies, the global instability index, GII [4], was calculated over the un-doped structure by varying the Al/Nb ratio in the two metal sites. Unpredictably, even the minimal values of GII obtained are very close to the limit of 0. 20 v. u. that implies strained structures. With a crystal field strength that decreases moving from x(Cr) = 0. 06 to 0. 50 apfu, and both the Racah parameters and the nephelauxetic trends nearly constants, no significant change in the degree of covalency and polarization of the Cr–O bond are found. The 10 Dq decreasing suggests an elongation of the local Cr–O distance for Cr 3 + increasing at site M 2 and to a minor extent at site M 1, fitting well the structural data on the long-range mean bond distances. The degree of structural relaxation around Cr 3 + was also assessed by means of the relaxation coefficient ε, until the structure will maintain the same symmetry. The AlNbO 4 lattice has a limited propensity to relax (ε≈ 0) and the AlNbO 4 structure follows the Vegard’s law. In contrast with the well known Al–Cr joins in garnets, spinels, perovskites and corundum, the AlNbO 4 structure is strongly constrained by other factors, like cation ordering and electrostatic charge balance. Indeed, the M 2 site hosting Al 3 + is underbonded and Cr 3 + can be accommodated at this site without significant strain for that the lattice does not need to relax around the bigger ion.

40|$|Ammonoids were {{collected}} from the Chainman Formation (Mississippian) of southeastern Nevada and southwestern Utah, the Phosphoria Formation (Permian) of southeastern Idaho and westernmost Wyoming, and the Thaynes Formation (Triassic) of northeastern Nevada and southeastern Idaho. The collections are interpreted to represent unwinnowed, untransported death assemblages of ammonoids which were subject to chemical conditions of the nekto-benthic environment. Associated lithologies were sampled and geochemically analyzed for content of phosphate and organic matter. Ammonoid fossil collections, combined with ammonoids ilustrated in the literature, were subjected to the graphical W and D analysis of Raup (1967). The basic parameteres involved {{in the description of}} shell-coiling geometry are whorl expansion rate, W, and the distance of the generating curve from the axis of coiling of the shell, D. Values of W determined range from 1. 32 to 3. 96, which correspond to slight and rapid increases in whorl height during coiling. Values of D determined range from 0. 02 to 0. 55, which correspond to extremes of involute and evolute coiling· geometries, respectively. Body chamber length corresponds with shell coiling geometry. Values determined in this study range from 10 ° to 540 °. Corresponding W values are 3. 96 and 1. 50, whereas corresponding D values are 0. 02 and 0. 40, respectively. Average body chamber length in analyzed ammonoids is observed to decrease from 297 ° to 209 ° from Mississippian to Triassic time. Increase in apertural area accompanied this trend, and a possible consequence was that a greater range of prey sizes was afforded ammonoids with shorter body chambers. Life-orientation, described as the angle between the apertural plane and the gravitational vector, is calculated entirely on shell form and other geometrical considerations. Recent observations concerning Nautilus, combined with fossil evidence of epizoan encrustation suggest that ammonoids had an ability to control orientation, which is not observed from preservable morphology. From Mississippian to Triassic time, no trends in reconstructed life-orientation can be substantiated, based solely on Wand D values. Rotational stability during directed locomotion is important for conservation of the energy budget of this nektonic carnivorous organ­ ism. This property is calculated by the distance between the center of buoyancy and the center of gravity of the ammonoid. Values deter­ mined range from. 04 (very unstable) to. 16 (very stable). Corres­ ponding W values are 1. 50 and 4. 00 where corresponding D values are 0. 20 and 0. 02, respectively. A trend toward increasing average rota­tional stability (. 07 to. 10) is noted for amrnonoids from Mississippian to Triassic time. Efficiency in the utilization of calcium carbonate is the ratio of internal volume of the shell to volume of shell material. Values determined range from 5. 80 to 7. 25. Corresponding W values are 4. 00 and 1. 50, corresponding D values are 0. 02 and 0. 54, respectively. Abundant ammonoids found in black, phosphatic limestones rich in organic matter have an average efficiency value of 6. 2. Abundant ammonoids from corresponding light-colored crystalline carbonates have an average efficiency value of 6. 02, and indicate no correlation between effi­ciency and abundance. Size-frequency distributions are utilized in recognition of oppor­tunistic species of ammonoids. High numerical abundance, high mortality rate of juveniles, small size and conservation of calcium carbonate typifies the paleo-opportunistic species Cravenoceras, Psuedogastrio­ceras and Ophiceras. Biovolume-relative abundance distributions are useful in discerning the carrying capacity of the habitat both in number of individuals and species diversity. A large area under the biovolume-relative abun­dance profile indicates diversification under optimum environmental conditions; a small area under the profile indicates colonization of a stressful habitat. The Chainman, Phosphoria and Thaynes (<b>Columbites</b> Zone) Formations have ammonoid assemblages which show small areas under the biovolume-relative abundance profile, characteristic of anoxic environmental stress. The Permian stratigraphic units correlative with the Phosphoria Formation have ammonoid assemblages which show large areas under the profile and the associated lithologies, i. e., light­ gray,crystalline carbonates, suggest environments which could support a diversified ammonoid fauna, including large-sized species. Ontogenetic variation produces changes in the body chamber length, life orientation, rotational stability, and utilization of calcium carbonate of the analyzed genera of ammonoids. These ontogenetic variations usually resulted in the development of more involute shell-coiling geometries. Corresponding size-frequency distributions suggest increased mortality rates during ontogeny for some genera (Paracravenoceras, Medlicottia) which show decreasing efficiency in the utilization of calcium carbonate.

500|$|Niobium is {{estimated}} to be the 34th most common element in the Earth’s crust, with 20ppm. Some think that the abundance on Earth is much greater, and that the element's high density has concentrated it in the Earth’s core.

500|$|Tantalum was {{discovered}} in Sweden in 1802 by Anders Ekeberg. One year earlier, Charles Hatchett had discovered columbium (now niobium), and in 1809 the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston compared its oxide, <b>columbite</b> with a density of 5.918 g/cm3, to that of tantalum, tantalite with a density of 7.935 g/cm3. He concluded that the two oxides, despite their difference in measured density, were identical and kept the name tantalum. After Friedrich Wöhler confirmed these results, {{it was thought that}} columbium and tantalum were the same element. This conclusion was disputed in 1846 by the German chemist Heinrich Rose, who argued that there were two additional elements in the tantalite sample, and he named them after the children of Tantalus: niobium (from Niobe, the goddess of tears), and pelopium (from Pelops). The supposed element [...] "pelopium" [...] was later identified as a mixture of tantalum and niobium, and {{it was found that the}} niobium was identical to the columbium already discovered in 1801 by Hatchett.|$|E
