At <b>column</b> <b>temperatures</b> of up to 80 C, hydrophilic linear polyacrylamide (LPA) provides superior read length and separation speed compared to poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide) (PDMA) and a 70 : 30 copolymer of N,N-dimethylacrylamide and N,N-diethylacrylamide (PDEA 30). DNA-polymer and polymer intramolecular inter-actions are presumed {{to be a major}} cause of band broadening and the subsequent loss of separation efficiency with the more hydrophobic polymers at higher <b>column</b> <b>temperatures.</b> With LPA, these interactions were reduced, and a read length of 1000 bases at an optimum temperature of 70 – 75 C was achieved in less than 59 min. By comparison, PDMA produced a read length of roughly 800 bases at 50 C, which was close to the read length attained in LPA at the same temperature; however, the migra-tion time was approximately 20 % longer, mainly because of the higher polymer con-centration required. At 60 C, the maximum read length was 850 bases for PDMA, while at higher temperatures, read lengths for this polymer were substantially lower. With the copolymer DEA 30, read length was 650 bases at the optimum temperature of 50 C. Molecular masses of these polymers were determined by tandem gel per-meation chromatography-multiangle laser light scattering method (GPC-MALLS).

50|$|The {{increase}} in the B term, as related to longitudinal diffusion, {{is associated with the}} decrease in the solute diffusion coefficient in the mobile phase, DM, due to the presence of the micelles, and an {{increase in}} the capacity factor, k¢. Again, this is related to surfactant adsorption on the stationary phase causing a dramatic decrease in the solute diffusion coefficient in the stationary phase, DS. Again an increase in temperature, now coupled with an addition of alcohol to the mobile phase, drastically decreases the amount of the absorbed surfactant. In turn, both actions reduce the C term caused by a slow mass transfer from the stationary phase to the mobile phase. Further optimization of efficiency can be gained by reducing the flow rate to one closely matched to that derived from the Knox equation. Overall, the three proposed theories seemed to have contributing effects of the poor efficiency observed, and can be partially countered by the addition of organic modifiers, particularly alcohol, and increasing the <b>column</b> <b>temperature.</b>|$|E
