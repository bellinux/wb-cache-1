40|$|With the {{constant}} diversification of cropping systems and {{the constant}} increase in farm size, new trends are observed for agricultural machinery. The increase in size of the machinery and {{the increasing number of}} contractors has opened the market to selfpropelled forage harvesters equipped with headers that can harvest row crops in any direction, at any spacing. High-capacity pull-type forage harvesters are also in demand but no commercial model offers non-row sensitive corn headers. The objectives of this research were to collect data and develop models of specific energy requirements for a prototype non-row sensitive <b>corn</b> <b>header.</b> The ability to better understand the processes involved during the harvesting and the modeling of these allowed the formulation of recommendations to reduce the loads on the harvester and propelling tractor. Three sets of experiments were performed. The first experiment consisted of measuring specific energy requirements of a non-row sensitive header, in field conditions, and to compare them with a conventional header. The prototype tested was found to require approximately twice the power than a conventional header of the same width, mostly due to high no-load power. Some properties of corn stalk required for the modeling of the energy needs, that were not available in literature, were measured in the laboratory. Those include the cutting energy with a specific knife configuration used on the prototype header and the crushing resistance of corn stalk. Two knife designs were compared for required cutting energy and found not to be significantly different with values of 0. 054 J/mm 2 of stalk cross-section area and 0. 063 J/mm 2. An average crushing resistance of 6. 5 N per percent of relative deformation was measured. Three mathematical models were developed and validated with experimental data to predict and understand the specific energy needs of the non-row sensitive header. An analytical model was developed based on the analysis of the processes involved in the harvesting. A regression model was developed based on throughput and header speed and a general model suggested in literature was also validated with the data. All three models were fitted with coefficient of correlation between 0. 88 to 0. 90...|$|E
50|$|There is {{a variety}} of John Deere {{equipment}} to choose from such as the 7820, 9520 and 5303 tractors with numerous attachments, and the 9660 combine with a hydraflex and <b>corn</b> <b>headers.</b> There are also smaller vehicles such as the John Deere Gator and ATVs.|$|R
40|$|This NebGuide {{describes}} {{problems associated}} with inadequate distribution of crop residue behind the combine, and identifies techniques to obtain proper distribution. Uniform distribution of crop residue during harvest {{is essential to the}} successful use of conservation tillage systems. Crop residue on the soil surface reduces soil erosion and conserves soil moisture. However, the residue must be properly managed to achieve these benefits. Uniform distribution behind the combine {{is an important part of}} this management. Large capacity combines equipped with 24 - to 30 -foot grain platforms and 8 - to 12 -row <b>corn</b> <b>headers</b> complicate residue distribution. When crop material is collected from a 30 -foot width and deposited from the rear of the combine in a 6 -foot band or windrow, residue related problems can be expected. This is a common problem with wheat, but has also been experienced with corn and other heavy residue crops...|$|R
40|$|R. Douglas Hurt {{deals with}} the {{invention}} and development of American farm implements and machinery with a special emphasis on the nineteenth century. The material is organized around the functions of various agricultural machines used in the major grain-growing states. Ten chapters focus on the improvements made in plows, grain drills, corn planters, cultivators, reapers, binders, <b>headers,</b> <b>corn</b> binders, corn shellers, threshing machines, combined harvesters, mowing machines, hay stackers, feed mills, and steam traction engines. The author decided to describe certain lines of farm equipment without trying to catalogue all agricultural tools, implements, and machines. Therefore the reader will not find descriptions of such items as cotton gins, saw mills, blacksmith tools, windmills, irrigation pumps, wagons, buggies, washing machines, and hardware materials. Also, during the period 1892 to 1914, no mention is made of the manufacture of {{the internal combustion engine}} and its uses in stationary gas engines, the early tractors, automobiles, trucks, and electric light plants. The judicious use of 219 photographs and illustrations gives a visual presentation of the evolution of rural technology. The verbal descriptions of mechanical and technical matters can be readily understood by the general reader. The book includes a good bibliography and a helpful appendix to aid the reader in understanding the importance of metallurgy as an important factor in the manufacture of farm machinery. Better farm machinery had to wait until the making of steel had been perfected. Some readers would welcome more analysis and interpretation of rural technology. For example, virtually all historians mention that our colonial forefathers used the wooden plow, the sickle, and the flail to grow crops, the same tools used thousands of years earlier in Biblical times. Why was this progress so slow? Why were no new machines invented in colonial America in the 170 years prior to the Revolutionary War? Why did it take two hundred years of experimentation before the first successful track-type Caterpillar engines were built in 1904 ? Combines were widely used in the Pacific Coast states in the 1880 s, yet they were not adopted in the Midwest until the late 1920 s, a lag of forty years. Perhaps historians should give more attention to the factors that deter progress and to the obstacles that prevent the adoption of new ideas, to try to explain the inability of people to adopt new methods. Nevertheless, the narrative is informative and well written. American Farm Tools is a fine addition to the historical record...|$|R
