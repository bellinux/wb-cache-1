In sustainable architecture the recent movement of New Classical Architecture promotes a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops smart growth, architectural tradition and classical design. This in contrast to modernist and globally uniform architecture, as well as opposing solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl. Both trends started in the 1980s.

500|$|In practice, {{demand is}} likely to be only {{relatively}} elastic or relatively inelastic, that is, somewhere between the extreme cases of perfect elasticity or inelasticity. More generally, then, the higher the elasticity of demand compared to PES, the heavier the burden on producers; conversely, the more inelastic the demand compared to PES, the heavier the burden on consumers. [...] The general principle is that the party (i.e., consumers or producers) that has fewer opportunities to avoid the tax by switching to alternatives will bear the greater proportion of the tax burden. In the end the whole tax burden is carried by individual households since they are the ultimate owners of the means of production that the firm utilises (see <b>Circular</b> <b>flow</b> of income).|$|E
2500|$|Physiocrats, a {{group of}} 18th-century French thinkers and writers, {{developed}} {{the idea of the}} economy as a <b>circular</b> <b>flow</b> of income and output. Physiocrats believed that only agricultural production generated a clear surplus over cost, so that agriculture was the basis of all wealth. Thus, they opposed the mercantilist policy of promoting manufacturing and trade at the expense of agriculture, including import tariffs. Physiocrats advocated replacing administratively costly tax collections with a single tax on income of land owners. In reaction against copious mercantilist trade regulations, the physiocrats advocated a policy of laissez-faire, which called for minimal government intervention in the economy. • ...|$|E

Thus, the relative ease of migration between the United States and Puerto Rico makes this case particularly pertinent. In the 1970s, migration from Puerto Rico to the United States was surpassed by reverse migration back to the homeland. This <b>circular</b> <b>flow</b> of migration is facilitated by the establishment of [...] "mobile livelihoods" [...] by these migrants.

2500|$|A simple <b>circular</b> <b>flow</b> {{of income}} diagram is {{replaced}} in ecological economics {{by a more}} complex flow diagram reflecting the input of solar energy, which sustains natural inputs and environmental services which are then used as units of production. Once consumed, natural inputs pass out of the economy as pollution and waste. The potential of an environment to provide services and materials {{is referred to as}} an [...] "environment's source function", and this function is depleted as resources are consumed or pollution contaminates the resources. The [...] "sink function" [...] describes an environment's ability to absorb and render harmless waste and pollution: when waste output exceeds the limit of the sink function, long-term damage occurs. Some persistent pollutants, such as some organic pollutants and nuclear waste are absorbed very slowly or not at all; ecological economists emphasize minimizing [...] "cumulative pollutants". Pollutants affect human health and the health of the climate.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} types of kreisel tanks. In a true kreisel, a {{circular}} tank has a circular, submerged lid. Pseudokreisels are [...] "U" [...] or semicircle shaped, usually without a lid. Stretch kreisels are a [...] "double gyre" [...] kreisel design, where the tank length is at least twice the height. Using two downwelling inlets {{on both sides of}} the tank lets gravity create two gyres in the tank. A single downwelling inlet may be used in the middle as well. The top of a stretch kreisel may be open or closed with a lid. There may also be screens about midway down the sides of the tank, or at the top on the sides. It is possible to combine these designs; a circular shaped tank is used without a lid or cover, and the surface of the water acts as the continuation of <b>circular</b> <b>flow.</b> [...] It is now possible to start a jellyfish aquarium at home as easily as a regular fish tank.|$|E
30|$|A common {{assumption}} is that closing supply chains would drive the reduction in extracting virgin materials {{as a consequence of}} their replacement with secondary <b>circular</b> <b>flows</b> (Ferrer and Ayres 2000).

40|$|The linear {{stability}} {{properties of}} viscous <b>circular</b> <b>flows</b> in a rotating environment are studied {{with respect to}} symmetric perturbations. Through {{the use of an}} effective energy or Lyapunov functional, we derive sufficient conditions for Lyapunov stability with respect to such perturbations. For <b>circular</b> <b>flows</b> with swirl velocity V (r) we find that Lyapunov stability is determined by the properties of the function F(r) = (2 V/r + f) /Q (with f the Coriolis parameter, r the radius and Q the absolute vorticity) instead of the customary Rayleigh discriminant Φ(r) = (2 V/r + f) Q. The conditions for stability are valid for flows with non-zero Q everywhere. Further, the flows are presumed stationary, incompressible and velocity perturbations are required to vanish at rigid boundaries. For Lyapunov stable flows an upper bound for the increase of the total perturbation energy due to transient non-modal growth is derived which is valid for any Reynolds number. The theory is applied to Couette flow and the Lamb–Oseen vortex. 1...|$|R

40|$|Amsterdam has the {{ambition}} to develop as a competitive and sustainable European metropolis. The flows of energy, water and resources within the urban environment {{have a large}} potential to contribute to this ambition.
