50|$|By 1900, Gormully & Jeffery was the country's second-largest bicycle {{maker and}} Jeffery had gained fame for developing, among other things, the <b>clincher</b> <b>rim</b> that enabled {{pneumatic}} tires to be used.|$|E
50|$|To reduce both air {{resistance}} and rolling resistance on the road, tires are lightweight, narrow, {{and have a}} thin, smooth tread. They are inflated to a high pressure, typically around 8 bar (820kPa/120psi); track racing tires can be inflated up to circa 14 bar. Until recently, most racing bikes used tubular tires which have no beads: they are sewn around the tube and glued to the rim. These tires provide an advantage in weight (lacking the relatively heavy wire bead), rolling resistance, grip and pinch flat protection, but their greatest advantage lies {{in the ability to}} use a very lightweight simple box-section rim, rather than the U-shaped <b>clincher</b> <b>rim.</b> A U-shaped <b>clincher</b> <b>rim</b> must be made of relatively heavier gauge material to prevent the tire pressure from spreading the inherently weak U shape and allowing the tire to come off the rim. Advances in tire technology, however, have seen the far more practical (due to greater ease of changeability) clincher (beaded) tire close the gap.Some manufacturers create tubular-clincher tires, where the tires are sewn around the tubes and have a bead, but there is some debate as to the effectiveness of a tubular-clincher tire. Proponents believe that it has all the advantages of a tubular tire made to fit a <b>clincher</b> <b>rim,</b> but critics argue that the design includes disadvantages inherent to both systems---the rim weight is still high, the tire is more expensive than a standard clincher tire, and repairing a puncture on a tubular clincher is as inconvenient as it is with a standard tubular tire. However, a particular benefit of the tubular-clincher design is that the risk of pinch flats is very low (like the tubular tire), yet it allows the use of the more popular clincher wheel.|$|E
50|$|More recently, {{tubeless}} clincher tires {{have become}} popular after their successful presence on mountain bikes {{for the last}} several years. Advantages include lower overall wheel weight (no inner tube), lower tire pressures allowing for more traction without risk of a 'pinch flat' and no glue as required for tubular tires. It should be noted that not all <b>clincher</b> <b>rim</b> designs allow for tubeless tires as an air tight contact surface is required to prevent the unintended loss of tire pressure.|$|E
50|$|Mavic {{also makes}} <b>clincher</b> <b>rims.</b> The Mavic Open Pro is popular for {{everyday}} road use. CXP rims are the semi-aero counterparts.|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 2010, Zipp {{introduced}} two major new technologies: the company’s first full-carbon <b>clincher</b> <b>rims</b> and the Firecrest aero rim shape.|$|R
5000|$|Traditional <b>clincher</b> <b>rims</b> were straight-sided. Various [...] "hook" [...] (also called [...] "crochet") designs {{emerged in}} the 1970s to hold the bead of the tire in place, {{allowing}} high (6-10 bar, 80-150 psi) air pressure.|$|R
50|$|Zipp’s 2010 {{product line}} {{featured}} two new wheel models. The Super-9 is a flat-sided, 27.5mm disc that Zipp claims matches the Sub-9’s {{ability to generate}} forward lift, but avoids the interference issues that have occurred with the Sub-9’s bulged section on bikes with very narrow chainstays. The new 101 wheelset featured the first aluminum <b>clincher</b> <b>rim</b> with a fully toroidal profile and reaches a lower price point than Zipp’s carbon wheels. 2010 also saw a redesign of the 303 wheelset with claimed improvements to strength, durability, and aerodynamics.|$|E
50|$|French tire {{manufacturer}} Hutchinson {{has introduced}} a tubeless wheel system, Road Tubeless, that shares many similarities to the UST (Universal System Tubeless) that was developed in conjunction with Mavic and Michelin. Road Tubeless rims, like UST rims, have no spoke holes protruding to the air chamber of the rim. The flange of the Road Tubeless rim {{is similar to the}} hook bead of a standard <b>clincher</b> <b>rim</b> but is contoured to very close tolerances to interlock with a Road Tubeless tire, creating an airtight seal between tire and rim. This system eliminates the need for a rim strip and inner tube.|$|E

5000|$|Tubular tyres {{require more}} labour {{to repair a}} {{puncture}} than clincher tyres (wired-on in Britain). The tyre must {{be removed from the}} rim, opened up, patched, sewn back up, then finally glued back to the <b>rim.</b> <b>Clinchers</b> have largely replaced tubulars for amateur racing (although they have see a revival due to the carbon rim being better suited to tubular design), but tubulars are still commonly used for indoor track racing (where the closed track makes punctures from road debris less commonplace), professional [...] road racing, road time trials, and cyclo-cross racing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{resulting}} combination {{was either}} slightly lighter or stronger than more common clincher tyres [...] until the <b>clincher</b> tyres and <b>rims</b> technology {{caught up in}} recent years. Taken as a whole the total weight of a tubular rim and tyre is always lighter than its clincher equivalent. However, for all non-racing purposes the lightness advantage is somewhat offset {{by the need to}} carry at least one entire spare tubular tyre (only a patch kit or inner tube are needed if using clincher tyres). Yet the extra weight—and more importantly, rotational inertia—is off the wheel, which therefore accelerates more easily. Advances in tire sealant have made carrying an extra tire a bit outdated.|$|R
