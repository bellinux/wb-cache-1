Why {{lines of}} this kind are beautiful, I {{endeavored}} to show in the [...] "Modern Painters;" [...] but one point, there omitted, may be mentioned here,--that almost all these lines are expressive of action of force of some kind, while the circle is a line of limitation or support. In leafage they mark the forces of its growth and expansion, but some among the most beautiful of them are described by bodies variously in motion, or subjected to force; as by projectiles in the air, by the particles of water in a gentle current, by planets in motion in an orbit, by their satellites, if the actual path of the satellite in space be considered instead of its relation to the planet; by boats, or birds, turning in the water or air, by clouds in various action upon the wind, by sails in the curvatures they assume under its force, and by thousands of other objects moving or bearing force. In the Alisma leaf, q r, the lines through its body, which are of peculiar beauty, mark the different expansions of its fibres, and are, I think, {{exactly the same as}} those which would be traced by the currents of a river entering a lake of the shape of the leaf, at the end where the stalk is, and passing out at its point. Circular curves, on the contrary, are always, I think, curves of limitation or support; that is to say, curves of perfect rest. The <b>cylindrical</b> <b>curve</b> round the stem of a plant binds its fibres together; while the ascent of the stem is in lines of various curvature: so the curve of the horizon and of the apparent heaven, of the rainbow, etc.: and though the reader might imagine that the circular orbit of any moving body, or the curve described by a sling, was a curve of motion, he should observe that the circular character is given to the curve not by the motion, but by the confinement: the circle is the consequence not of the energy of the body, but of its being forbidden to leave the centre; and whenever the whirling or circular motion can be fully impressed on it we obtain instant balance and rest with respect to the centre of the circle.|$|E

40|$|Slip casting {{behavior}} of a cylindrical body was analyzed by FEM(finite element method). Based {{on the assumption that}} the cake is uniform and incompressible, Laplace equation for liquid pressure can be derived. Cake growth per unit time was calculated by a sequential combination of the Laplace equation, Darcy's law and mass balances. The profile of solid front(the interface between cake and slurry) changed with time from a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>curve</b> to a parabolic one. This three dimensional profile can be attributed to the interaction of filtration to the bottom and side-wall directions in the cylindrical mold. In the early stage of slip casting, the results of numerical analysis were in reasonable coincidence with the profiles experimentally obtained.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel {{technique}} to calibrate multiple casually aligned projectors on a fiducial-free <b>cylindrical</b> <b>curved</b> surface using a single camera. We impose two priors to the cylindrical display: (a) cylinder is a vertically extruded surface; and (b) the aspect ratio of the rectangle formed by {{the four corners of}} the screen is known. Using these priors, we can estimate the display’s 3 D surface geometry and camera extrinsic parameters using a single image without any explicit display to camera correspondences. Using the estimated camera and display properties, we design a novel deterministic algorithm to recover the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of each projector using a single projected pattern seen by the camera which is then used to register the images on the display from any arbitrary viewpoint making it appropriate for virtual reality systems. Finally, our method can be extended easily to handle sharp corners- making it suitable for the common CAVE like VR setup. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method that can achieve accurate geometric auto-calibration of multiple projectors on a cylindrical display without performing an extensive stereo reconstruction...|$|R

Also, he had difficulties in trying to determine the position of Stereosternum, reporting that some characteristic point it into Rhynchocephalia or into Sauropterygia.

40|$|The {{classical}} spinning {{particles are}} considered such that quantization of classical model {{leads to an}} irreducible massive representation of the Poincaré group. The class of gauge equivalent classical particle world lines is shown to form a [(d+ 1) / 2]-dimensional world sheet in d-dimensional Minkowski space, irrespectively to any specifics of classical model. For massive spinning particles in d= 3, 4, the world sheets are shown to be cylinders. The radius of cylinder is fixed by representation. In higher dimensions, particle's world sheet {{turn out to be}} a toroidal cylinder R×T^D, D=[(d- 1) / 2]. Proceeding from the fact that the world lines of irreducible classical spinning particles are <b>cylindrical</b> <b>curves,</b> while all the lines are gauge equivalent on the same world sheet, we suggest a method to deduce the classical equations of motion for particles and also to find their gauge symmetries. In d= 3 Minkowski space, the spinning particle path is defined by a single fourth-order differential equation having two zero-order gauge symmetries. The equation defines particle's path in Minkowski space, and it does not involve auxiliary variables. A special case is also considered of cylindric null-curves, which are defined by a different system of equations. It is shown that the cylindric null-curves also correspond to irreducible massive spinning particles. For the higher-derivative equation of motion of the irreducible massive spinning particle, we deduce the equivalent second-order formulation involving an auxiliary variable. The second-order formulation agrees with a previously known spinning particle model. Comment: references added, formulas in Section III. B include...|$|R

40|$|SummaryUsing echo-dynamography, {{systolic}} {{blood flow}} {{structure in the}} ascending aorta and aortic arch was investigated in 10 healthy volunteers. The blood flow structure was analyzed based on the two-dimensional (2 D) and 1 D velocity vector distributions, changing acceleration of flow direction (CAFD), vorticity distribution, and Doppler pressure distribution. To justify the results obtained in humans, in vitro experiments were done using straight and curved tube models of 20 mm diameter. The distribution of the CAFD showed a spiral staircase pattern along the flow axis line. In addition, {{the changes in the}} velocity profile in the short-axis direction, 2 D distribution of the vorticity, and velocity vector distribution on the aortic cross-section plane, all confirmed the presence of systolic twisted spiral flow rotating clockwise toward the peripheral part of the ascending aorta. The rotation cycle of this spiral flow correlated inversely with the maximum velocity of the aortic flow, so that this cycle was shorter in early systole and longer in late systole. The model experiments showed similar results. The spiral flow seemed to be produced by several factors: (i) anterior shift of the direction of ejected blood flow due to the anterior displacement of the projection of the aorta; (ii) accelerated high pressure flow ejected antero-upward; (iii) inertia resistance at the peripheral boundary of the sinus of Valsalva; and (iv) reflection caused by the concave spherical structure of the inner surface of the basal part of the aorta. Because the main spiral flow axis line nearly coincided with the center line of the aorta, it is concluded that the occurrence of the spiral flow {{plays an important role in}} maintaining the blood flow direction passing through the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>curved</b> aortic arch and thus in keeping the most effective ejection as well as in dispersing the shear stress in the aortic wall...|$|R
