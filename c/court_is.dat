5|$|Another {{reason that}} was put forward by Jayakumar to justify a limited role by the {{judiciary}} was that the judicial process is unsuitable for deciding preventive detention issues. Persons who are potential threats to national security may act covertly, hindering the collection of evidence to secure a conviction in a court trial. By its nature, however, preventive detention is a precautionary measure and involves making decisions on limited information to prevent threats to national security from materializing. Jayakumar said that the <b>court</b> <b>is</b> ill-equipped {{to determine whether there}} are suspicious circumstances which justify pre-emptive action. Tham agrees with this view, but argues that it applies only where the courts review the exercise of executive power. He distinguishes the objective test applied in Chng Suan Tze from the situation mentioned by Jayakumar, since the <b>court</b> <b>is</b> only interested in whether there is a national security issue involved.|$|E
