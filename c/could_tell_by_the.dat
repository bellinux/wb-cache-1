500|$|The {{town meeting}} {{attracted}} a packed crowd of over a thousand, with Nixon supporters distributing anti-Voorhis literature at the door. The Senate proxies spoke first for their candidates, followed by Voorhis. Nixon, who had notified organizers {{that he would}} be late due to another commitment, arrived during Voorhis's speech, and remained backstage until the congressman had completed his talk. He then came onstage, shook hands with Voorhis, and delivered a fifteen-minute address. A question-and-answer period then followed, with a Nixon supporter asking Voorhis about his onetime Socialist registration, and about his views on monetary policy. [...] After the representative responded, a Voorhis supporter asked Nixon why he was making [...] "false charges" [...] about the supposed Voorhis CIO-PAC endorsement. [...] In response, Nixon reached into his pocket and pulled out a copy of a Southern California NCPAC bulletin mentioning the group's endorsement of Voorhis. [...] The congressman was unaware of the endorsement; those of his aides in the know had [...] "completely forgotten" [...] to tell him. [...] Nixon walked halfway across the stage and displayed it to Voorhis, asking him to read it for himself. Voorhis came from his seat and took it, and (according to Bullock, who served as timekeeper at the debate) [...] "mumbled" [...] that this seemed to be a different organization from the CIO-PAC. [...] Nixon reclaimed the document, and began to read out names {{of the members of the}} boards of directors of the two groups, [...] "It's the same thing, virtually, when they have the same directors." [...] The crowd began to cheer Nixon, who later wrote, [...] "I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> audience reaction that I had made my point", and to jeer Voorhis, who wrote, [...] "They'd boo and laugh at my remarks, and this disturbed me." ...|$|E
2500|$|The March 15 {{meeting was}} held in the [...] "New Building" [...] or [...] "Temple", a 40 by 70 foot (12 by 21 m) {{building}} at the camp. [...] After Gates opened the meeting, Washington entered the building to everyone's surprise. [...] He asked to speak to the officers, and the stunned Gates relinquished the floor. [...] Washington <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> faces of his officers, who had not been paid for quite some time, that they were quite angry and did not show the respect or deference as they had toward Washington in the past.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the attack}} on Peck's ranch the Apaches {{continued}} on towards Sycamore Canyon and the nearby homesteads, some twenty miles south of Arivaca. One of the homesteads was the cattle ranch of John [...] "Yank" [...] Bartlett and his partner Henry [...] "Hank" [...] Hewitt, located {{at the head of}} the canyon. On April 28, the day after the attack at Peck's ranch, a local man named Phil Shanahan was visiting the Bartlett ranch where his ten-year-old son, Little Phil Shanahan, was staying with Johnny Bartlett, the son of Yank Bartlett. Eventually Shanahan decided to ride back to his ranch, a few miles away, leaving his son, Little Phil, at the Bartlett ranch. Shortly after that the boys heard gunfire in the distance and then Shanahan stumbled back into view of the ranch house saying he had been shot. Yank <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> wound that Shanahan needed a doctor so he told his son Johnny to ride to Oro Blanco to get help and alarm the townspeople. Yank also told Little Phil to go back to his home and warn his mother and his sisters. Phil made it to his house without incident and he took his family into the mountains where they hid until the following day. But, while the Shanahans were in hiding, the raiders attacked their house, stealing food, clothing and killing some cattle. Not long after Johnny left, he discovered three men [...] "dressed in black and acting as if they were drunk." [...] Afraid, Johnny turned around and went back, only to find that the Apaches had arrived and were firing into the house. Johnny rode through the firing to the door of the house, he was not hurt but his horse was wounded and died in the doorway. Yank returned the Apache's fire, while at the same time trying to tend to Shanahan's wound, and received a bullet to one of his shoulders, but he remained conscious and continued to fight. When it was dark, Yank sent Johnny out to ride to Oro Blanco again.|$|E

60|$|Until he {{returned}}, Mike <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> nobody. And <b>by</b> <b>the</b> time {{he returned}} the notice would probably be up in the Senior Block with the other cricket notices.|$|R

60|$|Creeper {{continued}} {{on up the}} trunk of the tree, picking here and picking there. Just then Peter caught sight of another friend whom he <b>could</b> always <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> black mask he wore. It was Mummer the Yellow-throat. He had just darted into the thicket of bushes along the old stone wall. Peter promptly hurried over there to look for him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> you roughly <b>by</b> <b>the</b> pay-list," [...] {{the manager}} answered. [...] "Yes," [...] he continued, after some turning over of pages, [...] "he was paid last on May 20th." ...|$|R
6000|$|For a {{long time}} the Indian {{remained}} silent, and I <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> expression of his grave face whether my reasoning weighed with him or not; I therefore offered up a brief prayer that the Spirit of God might open his eyes--as well as my own--to see, and our hearts to receive, the truth, whatever that might be. Then I said,--"The thoughts of Big Otter are deep, what do they lead to?" ...|$|R
60|$|Old Man Coyote {{is himself}} a tireless runner. He {{is not so}} heavy as is Bowser, so does not tire as easily. Then, too, he had not wasted his breath as had Bowser with his steady baying. Old Man Coyote <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sound of Bowser's voice when the latter was {{beginning}} to grow tired, and he <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that he often had {{a moment or two}} to sit down and rest before Bowser got dangerously near.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Who is that?' cried Mr Abney. I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{sound of}} his voice that his nerves were on wires. 'Who was that who spoke?' ...|$|E

60|$|Rod, the off-horse of the pair, {{had been}} {{standing}} with one hip lifted, like a tired cow; and you <b>could</b> only <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> quick flutter of the haw across his eye, from time to time, that he was paying any attention to the argument. He thrust his jaw out sidewise, as his habit is when he pulls, and changed his leg. His voice was hard and heavy, and his ears were close to his big, plain Hambletonian head.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course. I believe you're {{a sort of}} honorary dog yourself. I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> it <b>by</b> <b>the</b> way {{you stopped}} that fight at Roville. You plunged into a howling mass of about a million hounds of all species and just whispered in their ears and they stopped at once. Why, the more one {{examines}} this, the better it looks. I do believe it's {{the one thing you}} couldn't help making a success of. It's very paying, isn't it?" ...|$|R
60|$|The wail was {{immediately}} {{followed by a}} real scream of terror from the small lungs. Tarzan was electrified into instant action. Like an arrow from a bow he shot through {{the trees in the}} direction of the sound. Ahead of him he heard the savage snarling of an adult she-ape. It was Teeka to the rescue. The danger must be very real. Tarzan <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> that <b>by</b> <b>the</b> note of rage mingled with fear in the voice of the she.|$|R
6000|$|... "In another {{instant the}} Indian's knife {{would have been}} in my body!" [...] he cried. [...] "I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fierce gleam in his eyes that he counted on taking my life." ...|$|E

5|$|Watched by a {{crowd of}} 55,722, Ajax {{took the lead in}} the third minute when Cees de Wolf scored. They {{extended}} their lead in the 17th minute courtesy of a Johan Cruyff goal. Two more goals scored by forward Klaas Nuninga meant Ajax had a 4–0 lead at half-time. Liverpool responded late in the game when defender Chris Lawler scored in the 89th minute; however, Ajax scored a minute later through Henk Groot to win the match 5–1. The spectators could not really see much of the match due to the fog's density and at times <b>could</b> only <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> celebration of the team when a goal was scored.|$|R
60|$|Ye Tea Shoppe was artistic. You <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> that <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{fact that}} none of the arts and crafts wares exposed for sale were in the least useful. And it was too artistic, too far above the sordidness of commercialism, to put any prices on the menu-cards. Consequently Father was worried about his bill all the time he was {{encouraging}} his guests to forget their uncomfortably decorative surroundings and talk like regular people. But when he saw how skinny were the sandwiches and how reticent the cinnamon toast he was cheered. He calculated that the whole bill couldn't, in decency, be more than ninety cents for the six of them.|$|R
2500|$|The {{gravitational}} constant appears in Newton's law of universal gravitation, {{but it was}} not measured until seventy-one years after Newton's death by Henry Cavendish with his Cavendish experiment, performed in 1798 (Philosophical Transactions 1798). Cavendish measured [...] implicitly, using a torsion balance invented <b>by</b> <b>the</b> geologist Rev. John Michell. He used a horizontal torsion beam with lead balls whose inertia (in relation to the torsion constant) he <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> timing <b>the</b> beam's oscillation. Their faint attraction to other balls placed alongside the beam was detectable <b>by</b> <b>the</b> deflection it caused. Cavendish's aim was not actually to measure the {{gravitational constant}}, but rather to measure Earth's density relative to water, through the precise knowledge of the gravitational interaction. [...] In modern units, the density that Cavendish calculated implied a value for [...] of [...]|$|R

60|$|She saw {{him walking}} with brittle, blind steps {{along the path}} by the river. She <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> strange {{stiffness}} and brittleness of his figure {{that he was still}} crying. Hurrying after him, running, she took his arm.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not know Paisley shawls from Indian, madam?" [...] said Touchwood; [...] "why, a {{blind man}} <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{slightest}} touch of his little finger.

60|$|She <b>could</b> now <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> noises that Manston had {{completed}} his re-erection of the cupboard. She heard him replacing the articles it had contained--bottle by bottle, tool by tool--after which {{he came into}} the brewhouse, went to the window, and pulled down the cloths covering it; but the window being rather small, this unveiling scarcely relieved the darkness of the interior. He returned to the workshop, hoisted something to his back by a jerk, and felt about the room for some other article. Having found it, he emerged from the inner door, crossed the brewhouse, and went into the yard. Directly he stepped out she could see his outline <b>by</b> <b>the</b> light of the clouded and weakly moon. The sack was slung at his back, and in his hand he carried a spade.|$|R
60|$|The {{regiment}} {{to which}} our friend {{had been appointed}} was the 71st Highland Light Infantry, which wore the red coat and the trews, and had its depot in Glasgow town. There we went, all three, <b>by</b> coach: <b>the</b> Major in great spirits and full of stories about the Duke and the Peninsula, while Jim sat in the corner with his lips set and his arms folded, and I knew that he killed de Lissac three times an hour in his heart. I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> it <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sudden glint of his eyes and grip of his hand. As to me, I {{did not know whether}} to be glad or sorry; for home is home, and it is a weary thing, however you may brazen it out, to feel that half Scotland is between you and your mother.|$|R
60|$|Without {{waiting to}} reload, {{or even to}} look if {{the main body of}} the Zulus had seen the death of their two scouts, I turned my horse and drove my heels into his sides. As soon as I was down the slope of the rise I pulled a little to the right in order to {{intercept}} the waggons before the Zulus saw them. I had not gone three hundred yards in this new direction when, to my utter astonishment, I struck a trail marked with waggon-wheels and the hoofs of oxen. Of waggons there must have been at least eight, and several hundred cattle. Moreover, they had passed within twelve hours; I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> that <b>by</b> <b>the</b> spoor. Then I understood; the Impi was following the track of the waggons, which, in all probability, belonged to a party of emigrant Boers.|$|R
6000|$|As I listened, I saw the Inspector <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{answering}} {{flash in}} my eye that his words recalled SOMETHING to me, however vaguely.

6000|$|In {{the hall}} {{he found a}} man whom he {{recognized}} as Melmotte's butler, a ponderous, elderly, heavy man who now had a letter in his hand.

6000|$|MURRAY. He only {{smiled and}} said: [...] "We'll {{see if you}} gain weight to-morrow." [...] As if that mattered now! Why, I'm way above normal as it is!

6000|$|As {{he thought}} and wondered, he grew {{more and more}} restless and unhappy. He could imagine no reason for the silence, unless Mr. Edmonstone had {{absolutely}} forbidden any intercourse, {{and it did not}} seem probable that he would issue any commands in a manner to bind a grown-up son, more especially as there had been no attempt at communication with Amy. It was terrible thus, without warning, to be cut off from her, and all besides that he loved. As long as Charles wrote, he fancied her sitting <b>by,</b> perhaps sealing <b>the</b> letter, and he <b>could</b> even <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> kind of paper and envelope, whether they were sitting in the dressing-room or down-stairs; but now there was nothing, no assurance of sympathy, no word of kindness; they might all have given him up; those unhappy words were like a barrier, cutting him off for ever from the happiness of which he had once had a glimpse. Was the Redclyffe doom of sin and sorrow really closing in upon him? ...|$|R

He's a right down good fellow, {{and a little}} sociable with the photographer's boy and the caulker and the {{blacksmith}} that work in the navy yard, {{but not so much}} with the others. The fact is, though it's private, and the others don't know it, he's a kind of an aristocrat, his father being a doctor, and you know what style that is-- in England, I mean, because in this country a doctor ain't so very much, even if he's that. But over there of course it's different. So this chap had a falling out with his father, and was pretty high strung, and just cut for this country, and the first {{he knew he had to}} get to work or starve. Well, he'd been to college, you see, and so he judged he was all right--did you say anything?" ...|$|R
40|$|The {{lower classes}} in Portugal, {{particularly}} in the country, are as hard working, sober, peaceable, and well-mannered a people as one could hope to find. They are, however, incredibly ignorant. To {{me it was a}} joy and wonder to find in Lisbon that the servants <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> time <b>by</b> <b>the</b> clock, and that they thought the French tongue was merely an impediment of speech. I twas a temptation never before dreamed of and triumphantly endured, to discover that the washerwoman would accept with childlike faith whatever was offered her because she could not count money. As for reading and writing, they are -to these simple people something like miracles of cleverness...|$|R
