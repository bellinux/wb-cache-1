40|$|Although most rural {{households}} {{are involved in}} the farm sector, the nonfarm sector has grown significantly in recent decades, and its role in rural development has become increasingly important. This article examines the effect of participation in nonfarm activities on <b>crop</b> <b>expenses</b> of farm households in Nigeria. The relationship is modeled using a nonseparable agricultural household model that suggests that participating in nonfarm activities can relax the credit constraints facing farm households and reduce risk thereby helping households improve farm production and smooth consumption over time. The results show that participation in nonfarm activities by Nigerian farmers has a positive and significant effect on <b>crop</b> <b>expenses</b> and in particular on payments for hired labor and inorganic fertilizers. Separate analysis of the six geopolitical zones in Nigeria indicates that it is in the South-South and South-East zones where nonfarm participation appears to induce more hiring of labor. The results support the hypothesis that nonfarm participation helps relax liquidity constraints but suggests how that liquidity is used is zone-specific. In general, the results also indicate that liquidity is used more to pay for inputs into staple production as opposed to cash crops.

40|$|This NebGuide {{discusses}} {{the advantages and}} disadvantages of cash leasing cropland. It also provides guidelines for setting a fair cash rental rate. Each year, more than 4 million acres of Nebraska cropland are leased under a cash lease arrangement. A cash lease involves the landowner conveying use of the cropland and associated management responsibilities to the tenant operator in exchange for a negotiated amount of cash. The cash payment is usually made in two installments, half at the beginning of the crop season and half at the end. Under a typical cash lease, the tenant operator receives all the crop income (including farm commodity program payments), pays all the <b>crop</b> <b>expenses,</b> and makes all crop management decisions. The landowner is responsible for the property taxes on the land and facilities included with the land (buildings, irrigation equipment), although (s) he may not be responsible for insuring or replacing these facilities if they are no longer serviceable. The use of cash leasing cropland varies across Nebraska; however, its popularity has increased in recent years as both landowners and tenant operators have opted for cash leasing over crop share leasing. Approximately 40 percent of the cropland leases and leased acreage in Nebraska were estimated to be cash rented in 1996...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Increasing land {{scarcity}} forces Rwandan {{farmers to}} expand flie area under food <b>crops</b> at the <b>expense</b> of pasture, fallow, and forest. Since the non-cropping uses of land provide more vegetative cover against erosion than most food crops, land scarcity {{appears to be}} associated with unsustainable land uses. However, demographic pressure also pushes farmers to grow crops in dense associations, which increases vegetative cover on cultivated fields. The estimated relationship between farm size and protective crop cover depends crucially on how the measure of vegetative cover is adjusted to account for high cropping densities. Without any adjustment, the association between land scarcity and erosive land use is strong; with the adjustment used here, it disappears, except for high-altitude areas, where bananas, the only major food crop that protects land well against erosion, do not grow well...|$|R
40|$|Economic {{comparisons}} of income on highly erodible land (HEL) in Adams County were made utilizing {{five years of}} grazing data collected from a 13 - paddock intensive-rotational grazing system and a four-paddock rotational-grazing system and four years of data collected from an 18 -paddock intensive-rotational grazing system, all at the Adams County CRP Research and Demonstration Farm near Corning. Net income from the average grazing weight-gain of Angus-sired calves nursing crossbred cows was compared to the net income from grazing yearling steers, to the net income of eight NRCS-recommended crop rotations, and to the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) option. Results of these comparisons show the 13 -paddock intensive rotational grazing system with cow-calf pairs {{to be the most}} profitable alternative, with a net return of $ 19. 86 per acre per year. The second most profitable alternative is the CRP option, with a net return of $ 13. 09 per acre, and the third most profitable option is the fourpaddock rotation with cows and calves with a net return of $ 12. 53 per acre. An 18 -paddock system returned a net income of $ 2. 47 per acre per year with cows and calves in 1993, but lost an average of $ 107. 69 per acre each year in 1994 and 1995 with yearling steers. Each year, the steers were purchased high and sold low, contributing to the large loss per acre. The following recommended crop rotations all show net losses on these 9 - 14 % slope, Adair-Shelby Complex soils (ApD 3) : continuous corn; corn-soybean rotation; corn-soybean rotation with a farm program deficiency payment; corn-corn-corn-oats-meadow-meadow rotation with grass headlands; continuous corn to “T” with grass headlands and buffer strips; continuous corn to “T” with grass headlands, buffer strips, and a deficiency payment; corn-corn-oats-meadow rotation to “T”; and corn-soybeans-oats-meadow-meadow-meadow-meadow rotation to “T”. Per-acre yield assumptions of 90 bushels for corn, 30 bushels for soybeans, 45 bushels for oats, and four tons for alfalfa were used, with per-bushel prices of $ 2. 40 on corn, $ 5. 50 on soybeans, and $ 1. 50 on oats. Alfalfa hay was priced at $ 40. 00 per ton and grass hay at $ 33. 33 per ton. The calf weight-gain in the cow/ calf systems was valued at $. 90 per pound. All <b>crop</b> <b>expenses</b> except land costs were calculated from ISU publication Fm 1712, “Estimated Costs of Crop Production in Iowa - 1995. ” Land costs were determined by using an opportunity cost and actual property tax figures for the land at the grazing site.

40|$|The New Zealand dairy {{industry}} has experienced rapid intensification during recent decades {{in response to}} increasing land values. Incorporating forage crops on the milking platform is a potential strategy to increase dry matter production and milk production for greater profitability. However, in previous studies, intensification has increased the cost of milk production. This has diminished the low-cost competitive advantage that New Zealand dairy producers have had in international markets. Feeding low crude protein forage crops {{has also been shown}} to reduce the nitrogen (N) concentration in cow urine, which may help reduce N leaching. This study used farm system modelling to determine the profitability and N leaching on the 160. 1 ha (effective) Lincoln University Dairy Farm (LUDF) when fodder beet, wheat for feed and sales, and a double crop rotation of maize and oats silage was grown. The cash operating profit was calculated using FARMAX® Professional Dairy, assuming $ 6. 00 /kg MS. The projected N leaching was calculated using Overseer TM (version 6. 2. 0), which is now compulsory for all farms in Canterbury under the Environment Canterbury Land and Water Regional Plan. The only crop scenario that increased profitability was fodder beet. Incorporating 10 ha each of spring and autumn grazed fodder beet increased operating profit by 20. 0 % to $ 4, 782 /ha compared to the existing 100 % pastoral system ($ 3, 984 /ha). The other cropping scenarios had significant decreases in profitability. Incorporating 20 ha of maize and oats silage reduced operating profit by 10. 6 %, despite increased overall dry matter production. This was due to poor feed conversion efficiency (FCE) and increased feed <b>crop</b> <b>expenses.</b> Operating profit reduced by 3. 2 % and 13. 1 % when wheat was grown for feed and sales respectively. The wheat (fed) scenario had similar milk production to the existing scenario, however greater crop expenditure. The wheat (sold) scenario had significantly reduced overall revenue which impacted on profitability. A second simulation with fodder beet was done so than daily intakes were increased to the recommended maximum 6. 0 kg DM/cow/day. Harvested fodder beet was included in the rotation and fed at 4. 0 kg DM/cow/day during mid-lactation when there was no grazed fodder beet available. The total fodder beet area was increased to 33. 9 ha, which increased the operating profit by 34. 8 % to $ 5, 368 /ha. The projected nitrate leaching for the all proposed scenarios increased due to significant nutrient loss from the cropping blocks. The overall N leaching increased from 34 kg N/ha for the existing system to 41 kg N/ha for both the fodder beet (20 ha) and maize/oats silage scenarios. Leaching was 39 and 37 kg N/ha for the wheat (fed) and wheat (sold) scenarios respectively. Leaching increased to 44 kg N/ha when the fodder beet area was increased to 33. 9 ha. It was concluded that fodder beet was the only suitable crop to increase profitability, however the projected increase in N leaching will likely prevent the strategy from being implemented...|$|R

Numerical tools such as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can help predict the climate inside a greenhouse. CFD however is still scarcely applied in a dynamic way (Nebbali et al., 2011) and under night conditions (Montero et al., 2005). The aim {{of this study is to}} implement an unsteady 2 D CFD model to predict the time-evolution of greenhouse temperature and humidity distributions all night long in winter, taking account of both radiative transfers and crop interactions with the inside climate. Beyond the classical conservation equations, a radiative submodel and a crop-submodel were activated. The latter takes account of both the heat and transpiration fluxes induced by the plants and their associated mechanical resistances which depend on the transfer mechanisms from the plant to the air. The boundary conditions were modified at each time step. Simulations were performed for a clear night on the basis of data collected in winter 2011 inside a 100 m 2 Venlo glasshouse with Impatiens New Guinea crop grown on shelves. Numerical results were validated against data recorded inside the greenhouse: roof temperature, inside air temperature, transpiration flux and air humidity. They highlight the influence of the dynamic boundary conditions on the evolution of the microclimate inside the greenhouse. This study demonstrates the ability of the CFD code to simulate the greenhouse climate evolution with realism. It also suggests a potential exploitation for designing the heating devices in order to optimize the inside climate and energy consumption for various outside conditions...|$|R

From 1980 to 2003, common farmland bird numbers fell by 28%. The collapse in populations {{seems to have been}} particularly severe in Great Britain, where there was a 95% decline between 1970 and 1998, and Ireland, which had only 1,000–1,500 pairs in the late 1990s. In the British Isles, such declines may be due to natural fluctuations, to which tree sparrows are known to be prone. Breeding performance has improved substantially as population sizes have decreased, suggesting that decreases in productivity were not responsible for the decline and that survival was the critical factor. The large decline in tree sparrow numbers is probably the result of agricultural intensification and specialisation, particularly the increased use of herbicides and a trend towards autumn-sown <b>crops</b> (at the <b>expense</b> of spring-sown <b>crops</b> that produce stubble fields in winter).

The overall study design involved a cross-sectional survey of 178 households in three rural Mexican communities on two occasions spanning both agricultural seasons. On each occasion, data were collected on the following: (1) income by source and by earner; (2) migrant remittances; (3) gifts and loans; (4) subsistence and cash <b>crop</b> production, <b>expenses,</b> and earnings; (5) major nonfood purchases: (6) household composition; and (7) household food use (during the previous week). Stepwise multiple regression was used to determine the factors associated with the percentage of income allocated to food (PFX) and the percentage of the food budget allocated to (1) maize, beans, and chile (TRAD); (2) meat, milk, and fruit (LUX); and (3) bread, pasta, and snack foods (PROC). All regressions were run controlling for income. The proportion of income from migrant remittances was negatively associated with PFX (winter). Subsistence score was positively related to PFX (summer). Migrant remittances (winter) and subsistence score (both seasons) were negatively associated with TRAD. Subsistence score was positively related to LUX (both seasons). Father's absence (both seasons), store ownership (winter), and private source of income (summer) were all positively linked to PROC. Mother's contribution to total income and cash cropping income were not significantly related to any of the dependent variables.

40|$|We {{can obtain}} {{important}} results from short-term field studies, but they don’t always capture year-to year variability. Long-term research often provides more reliable results that farmers need,” says Agricultural Research Service horticulturist Eric Brennan. Brennan speaks from personal experience. In 2003, {{he and a}} team of University of California-Davis collaborators began a 2 -year field study that evolved into a unique long-term investigation of high value organic cropping. The project, the Salinas Organic Cropping Systems trial, is being conducted on an ARS research farm and is now in its 10 th year of certified organic production. Brennan, who works in the ARS Crop Improvement and Protection Research Unit in Salinas, California, is analyzing a huge collection of data to pinpoint findings that can benefit commercial producers of organic <b>crops.</b> Production <b>expenses</b> for high-value organic crops like lettuce and broccoli can exceed $ 7, 000 per acre. Producers who pay high land rent need to maximize profits with an annual two- to three-crop rotation that also includes either keeping fields fallow in the winter or planting winter cover crops. Many farmers keep winter fields bare because of the extra work and expense of tilling cover crop residues into the soil. Planting a cover crop also requires allowing enough time for its residue to decompose before planting cash crops—and production schedules can become very tight if prolonged spring rains keep farmers from plowing under the winter cover crops. Brennan designed a long-term investigation of several different cover cropping strategies for an annual lettuce-broccoli production system. Six of the strategies involved cover cropping every winter, and the other two involved cover cropping every fourth winter. Brennan selected three winter cover crops often grown in the area—rye, mustard, and a legume-rye mix—and planted each at either a typical seeding rate or a rate three times higher. Seeding rates can affect a cover crop’s ability to smother weeds. All systems received the same fertilizer and irrigation inputs and pest management.

40|$|Most Australian banana {{production}} {{occurs on}} the north-eastern tropical coast between latitudes 15 - 18 °S, and can experience summer cyclone activity. Damage from severe tropical cyclones has serious impact on banana-based livelihoods. The most significant impacts include immediate {{loss of production}} and income for several months, the region-wide synchronization of <b>cropping</b> and the <b>expense</b> of rehabilitating affected plantations. Severe tropical cyclones have directly affected the main production region twice in recent years Tropical Cyclone (TC) Larry (Category 4) in March 2006 and TC Yasi (Category 5) in February 2011. Based on TC Larry experiences, pre- and post-cyclone farm practices were developed to reduce these impacts in future cyclonic events. The main pre-cyclone farm practice focused on maintaining production units and an earlier return to fruit production by partially or completely removing the plant canopy to reduce wind resistance. Post-cyclone farm practices focused on managing the industry-wide crop synchronization using crop timing techniques to achieve a staggered return to cropping by scheduling production to provide continuous fruit supply. With TC Yasi in 2011, some banana producers implemented these practices, allowing them to examine their effectiveness in reducing cyclonic impacts. Additional research and development activities were conducted to refine our understanding of their effectiveness and improve their application for future cyclonic events. Based on these activities and farm-based observations, suggested practice-based management strategies can be developed to help reduce the impact of severe tropical cyclones in the future. Canopy removal maintained banana plants as productive units, and provided earlier but smaller bunches, generating earlier-than-expected income. Queensland producers expressed willingness to adopt canopy removal for future cyclone threats where appropriate, despite its labor-intensiveness. Mechanization would allow larger scale adoption. Implementing a staggered cropping program successfully achieved a consistent, continuous fruit supply after a cyclone impact. Both techniques should be applicable to other cyclone-prone regions...|$|R

Larger farms were found to be more likely to obtain financial success with their farm businesses. Farms with lower farmland ownership were found to have higher possibilities of insufficient cash balance to meet all financial obligations and have to either finance the cash insufficiency with further borrowing or shrink their farm business due to high cash rent expense crashing farm revenues. Farms with a capital structure of lower debt proportion were found to be more likely to meet all financial obligations with cash generated from farm operation, while a higher debt load made the farm business risker because the deviation in rate of return on equity increased and the possibility of having an insufficient cash balance was increased when the debt-to-asset ratio increased [...] ...|$|R

Animals mobilize soil fertility through manure production, graze crop by-products, and transfer nutrients from distant pastures to cropped areas. Yet in these systems various interacting factors, i. e. climate variability, poor soil fertility, poverty, and institutional constraints limit the capacity of agri culture {{to keep pace with}} the growing needs of an increasing human population. The major trends associated with population growth are (1) increasing area <b>cropped</b> at the <b>expense</b> of rangelands; (2) reduced availability of and access to good quality grazing resources, and (3) seasonal migration of labourers and transhumance of herds. These trends lead to co-evolution of farming systems towards increased privatisation of resource use. This study examines the implications of the development processes where farming systems co-evolve with their surroundings. It explores the impact of integrated management of livestock and crops in rural communities on both the livelihoods of differently. endowed farms, and on the-agro-ecosystem. Different scenarios explored the co-evolution of three site's situated in Western Niger with their environment. The sites differ in relative area cropped. The scenarios simulate-the different future outcomes for varying socio-economic and biophysical criteria with either current or more intensive management. Explorative bio-economic models are used to compare a range of farm, livelihood and ecological indicators, and to reveal social and ecological trade-offs. If current agro-ecosystems and their environments co-evolve towards increased privatisation of grazing resources, then soil fertility is likely to deteriorate on the lands managed by the agro-pastoral groups. Soil fertility may improve on lands managed by the livestock-scarce farmers settled in villages, at the cost of declining farm incomes. The agro-pastoral groups are likely to resort to more distant pastures for feed. The village-based, livestock-endowed farms will resort to feeding on on-farm crop residues. Intensification, though associated with relative decreases in real incomes, will enhance food security in these new systems, except for the poorer settled farmers. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Intention {{of this research is}} to know Effort Analysis of Windu Shrimp (Penaeus monodon) Seeding which in it there are production cost, acceptance, earnings, payback period and the factors that supporting and pursuing the effort of windu shrimp seeding in CV. Benur Agung during 1 year which consist of 6 times cycle. Material used of this research is datas concerning production cost which in it there are fixed cost (farm effort rent, purchasing the equipments of hatchery and purchasing the equipments of water analysis) and erratic expense or variable cost (purchasing the mother of shrimp, foods, chemicals and medicines, equipments of packaging and crop, employees salary, technician salary, expense of packaging and <b>crop,</b> transportation operating <b>expenses</b> and others) during 6 times harvest in one year in in CV. Benur Agung, Bletok countryside, Bungatan district, sup-province Situbondo, East Java. Result indicated that amount of the expense of invesment weared during 1 year is Rp 22. 263. 000 and fixed cost which used in one year is Rp 3. 438. 250. While for variable cost that used during 6 times cycle start from first cycle is Rp 20. 120. 450, Rp 16. 209. 625, Rp 19. 200. 525, Rp 21. 817. 525, Rp 20. 632. 025, and and for sixth cycle equal to Rp 21. 012. 025. For acceptance during 1 year equal to Rp 170. 424. 000 and for earnings during 1 year equal to Rp 48. 233. 575, 04. It can be conclude that the amount of earnings come from amount of acceptance during 1 year of Rp 170. 424. 000, lessened by total cost produce during 1 year of Rp 122. 190. 424, 96 can be obtained by result of Rp 48. 233. 575, 04. Based on result of research can be suggested that in executor effort of windu shrimp seeding is much better CV. Benur Agung still use the way of or technique which have been done during the time. To the quality of windu srhimp mains require to be paid attention because this matter can influence amount, quality, and egg amount of yielded to forwards in execution of effort seeding of prawn windu...|$|R
40|$|The {{stable isotope}} ratios of {{atmospheric}} CO 2 (18 O/ 16 O and 13 C/ 12 C) have been monitored since 1977 {{to improve our}} understanding of the global carbon cycle, because biosphere–atmosphere exchange fluxes affect the different atomic masses in a measurable way. Interpreting the 18 O/ 16 O variability has proved difficult, however, because oxygen isotopes in CO 2 are influenced by both the carbon cycle and the water cycle. Previous attention focused on the decreasing 18 O/ 16 O ratio in the 1990 s, observed by the global Cooperative Air Sampling Network of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Earth System Research Laboratory. This decrease was attributed variously to a number of processes including an increase in Northern Hemisphere soil respiration; a global increase in C 4 <b>crops</b> at the <b>expense</b> of C 3 forests; and environmental conditions, such as atmospheric turbulence and solar radiation, that affect CO 2 exchange between leaves and the atmosphere. Here we present 30 years’ worth of data on 18 O/ 16 O in CO 2 from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography global flask network and show that the interannual variability is strongly related to the El Niño/Southern Oscillation. We suggest that the redistribution of moisture and rainfall in the tropics during an El Niño increases the 18 O/ 16 O ratio of precipitation and plant water, and that this signal is then passed on to atmospheric CO 2 by biosphere–atmosphere gas exchange. We show how the decay time of the El Niño anomaly in this data set can be useful in constraining global gross primary production. Our analysis shows a rapid recovery from El Niño events, implying a shorter cycling time of CO 2 with respect to the terrestrial biosphere and oceans than previously estimated. Our analysis suggests that current estimates of global gross primary production, of 120 petagrams of carbon per year, may be too low, and that a best guess of 150 – 175 petagrams of carbon per year better reflects the observed rapid cycling of CO 2. Although still tentative, such a revision would present a new benchmark by which to evaluate global biospheric carbon cycling models. ...|$|R
