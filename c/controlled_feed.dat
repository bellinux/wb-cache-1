Several associations have been found between maternal psychopathology and use of <b>controlling</b> <b>feeding</b> practices, yet the mechanisms that underpin these relationships are unclear. The current study investigates {{the role of the}} transdiagnostic process of perfectionism and maternal use of <b>controlling</b> <b>feeding</b> practices. The study was in two parts. The first part of the study was a cross-sectional questionnaire design. One hundred and two mothers of young children aged between 18 and 47 months completed self-report measures assessing maternal perfectionism, mood and use of <b>controlling</b> <b>feeding</b> practices. For {{the second part of the}} study, mothers who reported scores in the upper and lower quartiles on the perfectionism measure were invited to participate in a recorded observation of a mealtime with their child. A between groups design was used to compare those in the upper (n= 8) and lower (n= 14) quartiles on their observed use of <b>controlling</b> <b>feeding</b> practices. Self-reported pressure to eat was significantly related to both maternal self-reported perfectionism and maternal self-reported depression. The relationship between maternal self-reported perfectionism and use of pressure to eat was robust when controlling for self-reported depression. Furthermore, self-reported depression was not related to pressure to eat when controlling for self-reported perfectionism. In the second part of the study, no significant differences were found between the two groups on observed use of <b>controlling</b> <b>feeding</b> practices. However, mothers in the upper quartile were observed to make more positive comments about food. The findings tentatively support the hypothesis that clinical perfectionism may play an important role in maternal use of <b>controlling</b> <b>feeding</b> practices...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{establish}} the best predictors of maternal use of <b>controlling</b> <b>feeding</b> practices at 1 and 2 years of age. Design: A longitudinal study {{from birth to}} 2 years. Participants: Sixty-two mothers of 2 -year-old children. Measures: Infant weight at birth, 6, 12 and 24 months, breastfeeding history, infant temperament and feeding difficulties at 6 and 12 months, maternal demographics at 12 and 24 months, maternal mental health at 6 and 12 months, maternal <b>controlling</b> <b>feeding</b> practices at 12 and 24 months. Results: <b>Controlling</b> <b>feeding</b> practices at 1 year were predicted by perceptions of infant temperament at 6 months, birth weight, length of breastfeeding, mental health at 6 months, and mealtime negativity at 6 months. Parental <b>control</b> over <b>feeding</b> when their child reached 2 years was predicted by the mother's tendency to use that particular strategy at 1 year {{in combination with the}} perceptions of infant temperament and feeding problems at 1 year, weight at 1 year, length of breastfeeding in infancy, and/or maternal mental health at 1 year.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Dietetics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007 Motivation: There is an {{increased}} tendency {{in the field}} of nutrition research to conduct human feeding studies in order to test diet-disease hypotheses. Using well <b>controlled</b> <b>feeding</b> approaches subjects consume only foods that have been precisely formulated and prepared in a research kitchen. The development of these accurate experimental diets is essential {{in order to meet the}} study objective and provide valid scientific data. Research dieticians use computerised nutrient databases to design these diets that meet the study protocol diet specifications. In most trials the developed experimental diet is chemically analysed to validate the menu. Chemical analysis is an expensive and time consuming procedure and if analysis presents with different nutrient content than planned, adjustments to the menu will follow and a possible repeat of the chemical analysis for verification, adding to the costs of the trial. Limited information has been published regarding the procedures for the planning and nutrient analysis of diets for <b>controlled</b> <b>feeding</b> trials thus, research teams are depending on trial and error experiences in order to guide them in the processes of planning and nutrient analysis for <b>controlled</b> <b>feeding</b> trials in free-living subjects. Objectives: The main aim of this study was to describe the processes of planning and nutrient analyses of diets for <b>controlled</b> <b>feeding</b> trials in free-living subjects. •	The first objective was to develop appropriate methodologies for the planning of diets for <b>controlled</b> <b>feeding</b> trials in free-living subjects. Subsequently these recommended steps were used in developing a seven day menu cycle for a <b>controlled</b> <b>feeding</b> trial. •	Secondly, the reliability of the two nutrient databases available in South Africa was tested by comparing the nutrient analysis of the menu as calculated by the databases with each other, as well as comparing it to the standard reference of chemical analysis. Methods: •	The appropriate menu design methodology to be used in <b>controlled</b> <b>feeding</b> trials: In this study a literature search was conducted using electronic scientific journal databases. This literature search was done in order to locate published <b>controlled</b> <b>feeding</b> trials which described the methodology used for menu design. The information was summarised and a flow diagram was compiled presenting the identified steps that will guide the research team. •	The process of nutrient analysis for <b>controlled</b> <b>feeding</b> trials: A comparative study of two South African nutrient databases with chemical analysis: A seven day menu providing 7500 kJ/day (35 % of the total energy as fat. 17 % as protein and 48 % as carbohydrates) was developed. The menu was then entered into FoodFinder 3 and Dietary Manager Software programmes and nutrient analysis was done. Food prepared in the research kitchen, North-West University. Potchefstroom, South Africa, according to this menu was then chemically analysed for the macronutrient profiles (carbohydrate, fat, protein and fibre, soluble and insoluble fibre) and fatty acid distribution (saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids and poly-unsaturated fatty acids) using standard methods. Differences between the different nutrient analyses were compared with non-parametric statistical tests by using the computer software program Statistica. Results: •	The appropriate menu design methodology to be used in <b>controlled</b> <b>feeding</b> trials: Ten steps were identified and described in detail that will guide the research team in menu development for <b>controlled</b> <b>feeding</b> trials in free-living subjects. •	The process of nutrient analysis for <b>controlled</b> <b>feeding</b> trials: A comparative study of two South African nutrient databases with chemical analysis: The nutrient content of the two nutrient databases did not differ significantly from each other, however, there were differences between the chemical analysed values and the databases calculated values. There were no significant differences between the amount of total energy, protein, carbohydrate, poly-unsaturated fatty acids and total fibre. The total fat, saturated fatty acids and mono-unsaturated fatty acids content using both FoodFinder 363 and Dietary Manager were statistically and practically significantly higher than the chemical analysed values (p 40. 05). FoodFinder 3 B produced significantly lower levels of insoluble and soluble fibre compared to the chemical analysis. The main factors that were identified that could have contributed to these variations include the use of recipes and combination dishes not available on the database; variations in the fat content of meat dishes, and incomplete data of key nutrients in nutrient databases Conclusion: The 10 recommended steps need to be followed by the research team in order to accurately formulate, plan, produce and deliver research diets. There are important considerations to remember that might influence the success of the menu and the feeding trial. The use of computerised nutrient databases in menu design for <b>controlled</b> <b>feeding</b> trials is functional and assists the research dietician with this challenging task. However, computer nutrient databases are not reliable enough to exclude the step of menu validation by chemical analysis. Master...|$|R

40|$|Issue: Windshields are {{manufactured}} with {{two layers of}} glass with a strong plastic (usually PVC) membrane sandwiched between the panes. This structure limits recyclability dramatically. Plate glass itself is challenging to recycle because of its different chemical composition from container glass. Plate glass and automotive glass can be successfully recycled into construction aggregate or other secondary markets if the glass can {{be separated from the}} film. Separating film plastic from windshield glass requires that the glass be broken adequately to free the film, while keeping the film in large enough pieces that it can be removed without fouling equipment.

Indonesia), corn, bran, oil, premix, CaCO 3 and synbiotics (Lactobacillus sp. and inulin prebiotics). The ratio of feed was based on isoprotein and isocalorie, with 19 % of protein and 2900 kcal/kg of metabolic energy. The research was under a fully randomized in vivo experimental method with 4 treatments and 5 replicates, using 3 drakes each. These treatments were R 0 : <b>controlled</b> <b>feed,</b> with 0 % of synbiotics; R 1 : feed with 2 % of synbiotics; R 2 : feed with 4 % of synbiotics; and R 3 : feed with 6 % of synbiotics.

Overall, the present findings suggest gender differences in the relationship between maternal feeding practices and children’s eating behaviours emerge early and should be considered in future research and intervention design...|$|R
40|$|We {{found that}} leptin receptors were {{expressed}} in hypothalamic astrocytes {{and that their}} conditional deletion led to altered glial morphology and synaptic inputs onto hypothalamic neurons involved in <b>feeding</b> <b>control.</b> Leptin-regulated <b>feeding</b> was diminished, whereas feeding after fasting or ghrelin administration was elevated in mice with astrocyte-specific leptin receptor deficiency. These data reveal an active role of glial cells in hypothalamic synaptic remodeling and <b>control</b> of <b>feeding</b> by lepti...|$|R
5000|$|Since the {{requirements}} of organic swine systems require outdoor access and greater space requirements per animal than conventional systems, breeds and breeding management are very important for producers. The environment (geographical location, housing, contact with other animals) of the animal {{is one of the}} most important determinants of disease risk and exposure for organic swine. Typical <b>controlled</b> animal <b>feeding</b> operation (CAFO) production is characterized by slatted flooring; no bedding, <b>controlled</b> <b>feeding,</b> and strict production sectioning and isolation between groups. Typical organic systems include the following: ...|$|R
