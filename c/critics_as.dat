5|$|The {{desert is}} {{generally}} {{thought of as}} a barren and empty landscape.

5|$|While later {{reviews of}} the album saw It Was Written in a {{different}} light than previous reviews had, the subject matter was still seen as a major flaw of the album. Music critics perceived Nas' violent, fantastical mafioso stories as lacking the emotion and truthfulness of his debut album. While Illmatic is often held as Nas's magnum opus, It Was Written was not only perceived by <b>critics</b> <b>as</b> part of a sophomore jinx, but was also the first of Nas's subsequent work to be heavily judged and compared to the former. However, It Was Written has been noted as his commercial breakthrough by <b>critics,</b> <b>as</b> it boosted the rapper's image in the mainstream and helped attract a much larger fan-base.|$|E
