5|$|Bill C-19 (previously Bill S-4) titled An Act {{to amend}} the Constitution Act, 1867 (Senate tenure) was a bill to limit new Senators' tenure to eight-year terms. Currently, {{senators}} can stay in office until they reach the age of 75. The bill was first introduced {{by the government in}} the Senate on May 30, 2006. After <b>consideration</b> <b>in</b> <b>committee</b> and making amendments to the bill, the Senate recommended that the bill not be proceeded with until such time as the Supreme Court of Canada had ruled with respect to its constitutionality, which had not occurred prior to dissolution. The bill was reintroduced in the second session as a Commons bill on November 13, 2007, but did not become law before the session ended.|$|E
6000|$|The prime {{minister}} meanwhile fought the battle as {{a battle for}} a high public design once begun should be fought. He took few secondary arguments, but laboured only to hold up to men’s imagination, and to burn into their understanding, the lines of central policy, the shame and dishonour from which it would relieve us, the new life with which it would inspire Ireland, the ease that it would bring to parliament in England. His tenacity, his force and resource, were inexhaustible. He was harassed on every side. The Irish leader pressed him hard upon finance. Old adherents urged concession about exclusion. The radicals disliked the two orders. Minor points for <b>consideration</b> <b>in</b> <b>committee</b> rained in upon him, as being good reasons for altering the bill before it came in sight of committee. Not a single constructive proposal made any way {{in the course of}} the debate. All was critical and negative. Mr. Gladstone’s grasp was unshaken, and though he saw remote bearings and interdependent consequences where others supposed all to be plain sailing, yet if the principle were only saved he professed infinite pliancy. He protested that there ought to be no stereotyping of our minds against modifications, and that the widest possible variety of modes of action should be kept open; and he “hammered hard at his head,” as he put it, to see what could be worked out in the way of admitting Irish members without danger, and without intolerable inconvenience. If anybody considered, he continued to repeat in endless forms, that there was another set of provisions by which better and fuller effect could be given to the principle of the bill, they were free to displace all the particulars that hindered this better and fuller effect being given to the principle.(209) ...|$|E
50|$|The Bill was {{introduced}} on 9 December 2010 and passed through all {{stages in the}} House of Commons on 15 December. This is unusual, and only ever occurs with short, emergency legislation.

A proposal is considered against {{the status quo}} <b>in</b> one <b>committee,</b> and only upon its approval advances for <b>consideration</b> <b>in</b> a second <b>committee.</b> Committee members (i) are privately and imperfectly informed about an unobservable state of nature which is relevant to their payoffs, and (ii) have a publicly observable bias with which they evaluate information. We show that the tally of votes <b>in</b> the originating <b>committee</b> can aggregate and transmit relevant information {{for members of the}} second <b>committee</b> <b>in</b> equilibrium, provide conditions for the composition and size of committees under which this occurs, and characterize all three classes of voting equilibria with relevant informative voting...|$|R
50|$|In the United States Senate, a bill {{is either}} {{referred}} to committee or {{placed on the}} Calendar of Business after second reading. No vote is held on whether to read the bill a second time. In U.S. legislatures where <b>consideration</b> <b>in</b> <b>committee</b> precedes second reading, the procedure varies as to how a bill reaches second reading. In Illinois, for example, legislation is automatically read a second time, after which amendments are in order.|$|E
50|$|Clause-by-clause {{consideration}} in Canada {{takes place in}} a committee designated to study the bill in question. Generally speaking, clause-by-clause <b>consideration</b> <b>in</b> <b>committee</b> takes place in-between the second and third readings of the bill; however, the House of Commons (or the Senate, as the case may be) do have the authority to refer a bill to a committee before the second reading stage has been completed. While studying the clauses of the bill, the committee can choose to adopt them, delete them, or amend them. However, any amendments made must remain true to the principal goal of the bill (unless the bill has not yet passed second reading in the House).|$|E

50|$|The {{legislative}} procedure goes through five stages. First, a bill is introduced to parliament either {{by a member}} of government or, {{in the case of a}} private member's bill, by any individual representative. Parliament will refer the bill to the relevant standing committee, where it will be subjected to detailed <b>consideration</b> <b>in</b> the <b>committee</b> stage. The first reading takes place when parliament debates the recommendation from the committee, and then takes a vote. If the bill is dismissed, the procedure ends. The second reading takes place at least three days after the first reading, in which parliament debates the bill again. A new vote is taken, and if successful, the bill is submitted to the King in Council for royal assent. If parliament comes to a different conclusion during the second reading, a third reading will be held at least three days later, repeating the debate and vote, and may adopt the amendments from the second reading or finally dismiss the bill.|$|R
5000|$|When {{adopting}} the laws the Parliament violated {{a number of}} its own procedural rules. The laws were voted mostly by showing of hands. This is allowed by the Rules of Procedureuk but only {{when there is no}} [...] "technical possibility" [...] to vote through the electronic system. Moreover, hands were [...] "counted" [...] within a few seconds, {{based on the number of}} MPs included in the parliamentary groups, while many MPs were in fact absent. Diplomas observing the votes counted only some 100 to 140 raised hands, while the laws would have needed to be adopted by a majority of 226 votes. Most of the laws were adopted without prior <b>consideration</b> <b>in</b> the parliament's <b>committees</b> as required and with no time for examining the laws even by the MPs.|$|R
50|$|The Atlanta Preservation Center {{published}} {{an article on the}} Atlanta Constitution Building in its newsletter, Preservation Times:The APC has been advocating for the city to consider this building as part of its multimodal rail system. Dispossession of this city-owned building was held for <b>consideration</b> <b>in</b> the <b>committee</b> headed by former city council member Clair Muller. The current administration has now released ownership of the building to the DoT.The review process concerning the proposed demolition of this building was a great concern to the APC, and the National Trust agreed that the process was problematic. Both organizations went on record to protest {{the manner in which the}} review had been conducted. The APC's executive director Boyd Coons was called by former city council member Mary Norwood to make statements about the value and possibilities of the building.The preservation community continues to hope that the building will be saved. It is currently the subject of a study by Tony Rizzuto, associate professor at Southern Polytechnic State University. Rizzuto, who is also chairman of the Midtown Land Use Committee and sits on the developmental review committee of DRC, SPI 16, is looking into how the building can be utilized as part of the rail transportation program being developed.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the middle}} of January, with the Bill having had eight days of <b>consideration</b> <b>in</b> <b>Committee</b> in the House of Lords, the Government voiced concern {{about the length of}} time being taken for a Bill which needed to be enacted by 16 February in order to allow the planned {{referendum}} to take place in May. Three of the Lords' four sitting days in the following week were set aside for the Bill and the Prime Minister's spokesman commented that some could be long days, with the House possibly sitting all night. The Leader of the House of Lords, Lord Strathclyde, complained that [...] "the Labour peers are on a go-slow" [...] and filibustering the Bill. He was reported to be considering introducing a guillotine motion to the debate, which would have been an unprecedented move for the House of Lords.|$|E
60|$|It {{is proper}} that his Majesty {{and all his}} people should be {{informed}} that the House of Commons have proceeded, {{with regard to the}} East India Company, with a degree of care, circumspection, and deliberation, which has not been equalled in the history of Parliamentary proceedings. For sixteen years the state and condition of that body has never been wholly out of their view. In the year 1767 the House took those objects into <b>consideration,</b> <b>in</b> a <b>committee</b> of the whole House. The business was pursued in the following year. In the year 1772 two committees were appointed for the same purpose, which examined into their affairs with much diligence, and made very ample reports. In the year 1773 the proceedings were carried to an act of Parliament, which proved ineffectual to its purpose. The oppressions and abuses in India have since rather increased than diminished, on account of the greatness of the temptations, and convenience of the opportunities, which got the better of the legislative provisions calculated against ill practices then in their beginnings; insomuch that, <b>in</b> 1781, two <b>committees</b> were again instituted, who have made seventeen reports. It was upon the most minute, exact, and laborious collection and discussion of facts, that the late House of Commons proceeded in the reform which they attempted in the administration of India, but which has been frustrated by ways and means the most dishonorable to his Majesty's government, and the most pernicious to the Constitution of this kingdom. His Majesty was so sensible of the disorders in the Company's administration, that the consideration of that subject was no less than six times recommended to this House in speeches from the throne.|$|R

2500|$|Additional action {{followed}} {{over the}} next several years. In July 1990, Senator Orrin Hatch proposed an amendment to the [...] "Senatorial Election Campaign Act of 1989" [...] (S. 137), a major campaign finance reform bill then under <b>consideration</b> <b>in</b> the U.S. Senate. The Hatch amendment was defeated on a close vote of 59-to-41. Senator David Boren then proposed a less restrictive amendment to S. 137, which was adopted by a vote of 57 to 43. Although the amended bill passed the Senate on August 1, 1990, it was never referred to the House and died {{at the end of the}} congressional session. DeLay reintroduced his Beck bill in 1991, where it died again without action. In 1996, Representative Harris W. Fawell introduced the [...] "Worker Right to Know Act" [...] (H.R. 3580), a bill to amend the NLRA to ban unions from charging any worker (member or nonomember) fees unrelated to collective bargaining, contract administration, or grievance adjustment unless the worker gave the union explicit, annual consent. Hearings on the legislation occurred, but the bill died <b>in</b> <b>committee.</b> <b>In</b> 1997, Senator Paul Coverdell introduced a bill (S. 497, the [...] "National Right to Work Act of 1997") which would have banned all compulsory union membership.

40|$|Background: Local ethical <b>committees</b> <b>in</b> medical {{sciences}} in Iran {{were established}} in 1999 {{in order to assess}} and evaluate the observance of ethical standards throughout the universities and research centers. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the situation of local ethical <b>committees</b> <b>in</b> order to develop research ethics guideline. Methods: For this cross-sectional study which has been conducted with the support of WHO, 40 local ethical <b>committees</b> <b>in</b> all universities of medical sciences were evaluated by use of determined questionnaires. Results: In this study, 40 universities of medical sciences participated; all of them have established local ethical committees. Each committee has 5 to 11 members and in more than 80 % cases, written guidelines for selecting the committee′s members are available. The minimum number of members for official session is at least 3 and replacement of absent members, did not take place in more than 85 % of the <b>committees.</b> Informed consent <b>in</b> 95 % of these local ethical <b>committees</b> is available. <b>In</b> all <b>committees,</b> researches regarding the use of human subjects are under ethical <b>consideration.</b> <b>In</b> half of the local ethical committees, penalties for non-compliance with the regulations are considered. The average number of research project evaluated in last session of these committees was 15. 2 and the <b>committees</b> <b>in</b> 50 % of cases have provided ethics training specifically for their members. Conclusions: Policymakers should develop a standard guideline for local ethical <b>committees</b> <b>in</b> medical science universities in Iran...|$|R
