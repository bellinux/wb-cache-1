25|$|Again and again, {{revert to}} your old principles—seek peace and ensue it; leave America, {{if she has}} taxable matter in her, to tax herself. I am not here going into the distinctions of rights, nor {{attempting}} to mark their boundaries. I do not enter into these metaphysical distinctions; I hate the very sound of them. Leave the Americans as they anciently stood, and these distinctions, born of our unhappy contest, will die along with it... Be content to bind America by laws of trade; you have always done it... Do not burthen them with taxes... But if intemperately, unwisely, fatally, you sophisticate and poison the very source of government by urging subtle deductions, and consequences odious to those you govern, from the unlimited and illimitable nature of supreme sovereignty, you will teach them by these means to call that sovereignty itself in question... If that sovereignty and their freedom cannot be reconciled, which will they take? They will <b>cast</b> <b>your</b> sovereignty in your face. No body of men will be argued into slavery.|$|E
500|$|In September, the Gold Democrats met in {{convention}} in Indianapolis. [...] Loyal to Cleveland, {{they wanted to}} nominate him. [...] However, the President ruled this out; his Cabinet members also refused to run. [...] Not even supporters thought the Gold Democrats would win; {{the purpose was to}} have a candidate who would speak for the gold element in the party, and who would divide the vote and defeat Bryan. [...] Illinois Senator John M. Palmer was eager to be the presidential candidate, and the convention nominated him with Kentucky's Simon Bolivar Buckner as his running mate. [...] Palmer was a 79-year-old former Union general, Buckner a 73-year-old former Confederate of that rank; the ticket was the oldest in combined age in American history, and Palmer the second-oldest presidential candidate (behind Peter Cooper of the Greenback Party; Bryan was the youngest). [...] The Gold Democrats received quiet financial support from Hanna and the Republicans. Palmer proved an able campaigner who visited most major cities in the East, and in the final week of his campaign, told listeners, [...] "I will not count it any great fault if next Tuesday you decide to <b>cast</b> <b>your</b> ballots for William McKinley." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the {{publication}} of their first book Generations, Martin Keller, {{professor of history at}} Brandeis University, said that the authors [...] "had done their homework". He said that their theory could be seen as pop-sociology and that it would [...] "come in for a lot more criticism as history. But it's almost always true that the broader you <b>cast</b> <b>your</b> net, the more holes it's going to have. And I admire [...] boldness." [...] Harvard sociologist David Riesman said the book showed an [...] "impressive grasp of a great many theoretical and historical bits and pieces". The Times Literary Supplement called it [...] "fascinating," [...] but also, [...] "about as vague and plausible as astrological predictions." [...] Publishers Weekly, though, called Generations [...] "as woolly as a newspaper horoscope".|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{personal}} reflection on the implementation of an online survey, highlighting the tradeoffs between the potential benefits and pitfalls. It is argued that <b>casting</b> <b>your</b> net out too wide, {{in a bid to}} maximise responses can result ultimately in a low response rate. We evaluate the experience of completing an online survey from the perspective of both the researcher and the respondent to outline the dynamics of the completion and submission process. Finally, in a bid to assist those interested, a review of some of the online survey tools is presented...|$|R
