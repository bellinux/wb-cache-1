50|$|Dead centre {{is rarely}} {{a problem for}} {{internal}} combustion engines, as these usually require cranking over to provide cylinder compression and so do not attempt to self-start from stationary. Some large stationary diesel engines, where these used a <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>starting</b> mechanism, have suffered from the problem of dead centres and so used a small manual barring gear.|$|E
50|$|The {{installation}} of these engines was somewhat unorthodox, necessitated by the limited funds for new work. The rear engine was started first by <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>starting,</b> then the front engine was started through a mechanical friction clutch. Once synchronised, they were locked {{together with a}} dog clutch for the record attempt. The car's last run was a demonstration circuit at Brooklands, running at slow speed on only one engine, with this dog clutch disconnected.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} diesel <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>starting</b> system {{calculation}} method {{based on the}} comparison between the compressed air efficient work and the work consumed by the air compression in the engine cylinder during the compression stroke. Approximate engine starting time duration depending on pressure in starting air receiver correlations were found, as well as compressed air consumption. The approximate correlations for calculating pressure drop in receivers depending on the receiver volume and the volume of air consumption at engine starting were given. The calculation of starting process using found out correlations was made for six cylinder slow speed engine as an example...|$|E

Duplicated electrical and <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> engine <b>start</b> systems are also used.

50|$|The {{vacuum brake}} is a braking system {{employed}} on trains and {{introduced in the}} mid-1860s. A variant, the automatic vacuum brake system, became almost universal in British train equipment and in countries influenced by British practice. Vacuum brakes also enjoyed {{a brief period of}} adoption in the United States, primarily on narrow-gauge railroads. Its limitations caused it to be progressively superseded by <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> systems <b>starting</b> in the United Kingdom from the 1970s onward. The vacuum brake system is now obsolete; it is not in large-scale usage anywhere in the world, other than in South Africa, largely supplanted by air brakes.|$|R

5000|$|The Gyroplane {{prototype}} first flew in Spring 1960. [...] It {{was later}} {{lost in a}} crash. The <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> jump <b>start</b> system was not a success, so the second prototype used the engine, connected via a belt, clutch and gear box. This aircraft was also made lighter than the first with more use of aluminium and fibreglass, increasing cruising speed by 25%. [...] It was followed by three pre-production aircraft. By the end of 1963 more than 300 flying hours were completed. In December 1964 Avian received a $540,000 Canadian government contract to build a modified Gyroplane that would take the type to Certification. This was achieved late in 1968.|$|R
50|$|At Oscarsborg the torpedo {{battery is}} a {{concrete}} construction inside a cave mined {{into the rock}} of the North Kaholmen island. Two torpedoes are loaded side by side, in two open steel frames. Then {{one of the two}} frames is lowered like an elevator down into the water to the tunnels below. After one shot, it took some time to swap frames and be ready for the next. When fired, the torpedo's own <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> engine was <b>started</b> and it propelled itself. The battery has three torpedo tunnels which could fire six torpedoes without reloading and a total of nine torpedoes was stored and ready for use. Each weapon carried a 100 kg TNT warhead and targets were spotted from three observation bunkers just above the battery.|$|R
50|$|The {{ship was}} fitted with two {{underwater}} torpedo tubes. These were cast-iron cylinders {{attached to a}} swivel joint in the hull, one on each bow. Inside the ship the opposite end was attached to a graduated scale for targeting. There was a watertight door {{at either end of}} the tube. The 14 in torpedoes were loaded inside a brass cylinder which slid into the iron casting. To fire the torpedo, the outer door was opened and a 10 ft guide was extended which helped the torpedo clear the currents around the ship. A piston in the brass cylinder forced out the torpedo when it was to be fired, and at the same time its own <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> motor was <b>started.</b>|$|R
50|$|Large Diesel {{generators}} {{and almost all}} Diesel engines used as the prime mover of ships use <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> acting directly on the cylinder head. This is not ideal for smaller Diesels, as it provides too much cooling on starting. Also, the cylinder head needs to have enough space to support an extra valve for the <b>air</b> <b>start</b> system. The <b>air</b> <b>start</b> system is conceptually very similar to a distributor in a car. There is an air distributor that is geared to the camshaft of the Diesel engine; {{on the top of}} the air distributor is a single lobe similar to what is found on a camshaft. Arranged radially around this lobe are roller tip followers for every cylinder. When the lobe of the air distributor hits one of the followers it will send an air signal that acts upon the back of the <b>air</b> <b>start</b> valve located in the cylinder head, causing it to open. <b>Compressed</b> <b>air</b> is provided from a large reservoir that feeds into a header located along the engine. As soon as the <b>air</b> <b>start</b> valve is opened, the <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> is admitted and the engine will begin turning. It can be used on 2-cycle and 4-cycle engines and on reversing engines. On large 2-stroke engines less than one revolution of the crankshaft is needed for starting.|$|R

40|$|A new cooling {{approach}} with cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> {{has been developed}} in order to cool the cutting tool edge during turning of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy. The cutting forces, chip morphology and chip temperature were measured and compared with those measured during machining with <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling and dry cutting conditions. The chip temperature is lower with cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling than those with <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling and dry machining. The combined effects of reduced friction and chip bending away from the cutting zone {{as a result of}} the high-speed air produce a thinner chip with cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling and a thicker chip with <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling compared to dry machining alone. The marginally higher cutting force associated with the application of cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> compared with dry machining is the result of lower chip temperatures and a higher shear plane angle. The tendency to form a segmented chip is higher when machining with cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> than that with <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> and dry machining only within the ranges of cutting speed and feed when chip transitions from continuous to the segmented. The effect of cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> on the cutting force and chip formation diminishes with increase in cutting speed and feed rate. The application of both <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> and cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> reduced flank wear and the tendency to form the chip built-up edge. This resulted in a smaller increase in cutting forces (more significantly in the feed force) after cutting long distance compared with that observed in dry machining...|$|R
