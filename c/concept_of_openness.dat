5000|$|Openness to {{experience}} is {{strongly related to}} the psychological construct of absorption defined as [...] "a disposition for having episodes of 'total' attention that fully engage one's representational (i.e. perceptual, enactive, imaginative, and ideational) resources.” The construct of absorption was developed in order to relate individual differences in hypnotisability to broader aspects of personality. The construct of absorption influenced Costa and McCrae's development of the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> {{to experience}} in their original NEO model due to the independence of absorption from extraversion and neuroticism. A person's openness to becoming absorbed in experiences seems to require a more general openness to new and unusual experiences. Openness to experience, like absorption has modest positive correlations with individual differences in hypnotisability. Factor analysis {{has shown that the}} fantasy, aesthetics, and feelings facets of openness are closely related to absorption and predict hypnotisability, whereas the remaining three facets of ideas, actions, and values are largely unrelated to these constructs. This finding suggests that openness to experience may have two distinct yet related subdimensions: one related to aspects of attention and consciousness assessed by the facets of fantasy, aesthetics, and feelings; the other related to intellectual curiosity and social/political liberalism as assessed by the remaining three facets. However, all of these have a common theme of ‘openness’ in some sense. This two-dimensional view of openness to experience is particularly pertinent to hypnotisability. However, when considering external criteria other than hypnotisability, it is possible that a different dimensional structure may be apparent, e.g. intellectual curiosity may be unrelated to social/political liberalism in certain contexts.|$|E

40|$|Marine species {{possessing}} widely dispersing larvae {{are often}} {{considered to have}} open populations. However, two concepts are covered by the phrase 2 ̆ 7 open population 2 ̆ 7.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Openness</b> <b>of</b> a {{software}} product or software producing and end-user organization {{is perceived as}} a binary concept: organizations are perceived to be closed, with its negative connotations, such as being dictatorial, undemocratic, and opaque, whereas an open organization is positively considered to be transparent and favorable to deal with. The binary view <b>of</b> <b>openness,</b> however, is harmful for the software industry, since wrong decisions are made on these qualifications, calling for a better definition <b>of</b> the <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> and closeness.

40|$|Background {{in music}} psychology. Emotion {{and meaning in}} music can in general be studied in two {{different}} ways. On the one hand, empirical aesthetics (e. g. Berlyne 1971) tries to explain responses to music such as pleasure, preference, or physiological responses (e. g. arousal) by analysing informational properties of the music (complexity, structure, tempo, mode etc.). On the other hand, researchers investigate the function of music and its emotional qualities in everyday life (e. g. Sloboda 2001). Both quantitative and qualitative methods in music psychology try to generate meaning and emotion in music {{at the expense of}} actual, individual experience. Some approaches (e. g. Imberty 1979, 1981), however, try to link musical structures, musical expressivity and psychoanalytical concepts. Background in music philosophy. Phenomenology and postmodern philosophy criticise traditional psychology’s construction of a subject as a closed entity. This concept was deconstructed by e. g. Nietzsche, Heidegger and Derrida, who argued that the separation of any phenomenon from the observer as rational/conscious entity (Kant, Descartes) is a metaphysic construction. Eco’s <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> of art and a postmodern concept of subjectivity give rise to a new way of describing music perception in which semiosis (motion of meaning) plays a major role (cf. Monelle 1992). Aims.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a systematic analysis}} of {{the similarities and differences}} between the fields of open innovation and open strategy. In particular, we examine the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> from a communication-centered perspective and compare processes of open innovation and open strategy with regard to the openness they exhibit. By distinguishing between openness in terms of sociality, factuality and temporality, we find that cases of open strategy tend to exhibit lower degrees of openness in the social dimension and higher degrees in the other two when compared to open innovation. Notwithstanding variation within and between the fields of open innovation and open strategy, opening up in one dimension of communication will generally result in pressures to decrease openness with regards to the other dimensions – unless particular tools are employed that help cope with the additional degrees of communicative complexity...|$|E

40|$|The <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> {{is usually}} {{discussed}} {{in relation to}} technological developments that facilitated its emergence (Peter and Deimann, 2013), in particular, the rise of digital technology and the Internet, which are changing the nature of information by making it more accessible to anyone and making it more ‘responsive’, allowing information to be enhanced or degraded by anyone (Peter and Deimann, 2013). Openness is being also driven by the fundamental philosophical claim that knowledge {{should be considered a}} common good and be accessible as openly as possible. In the context of high costs of education and the need to make education more accessible and aff ordable, it has been argued that, if education is paid for by the public, then research and content produced with those public funds should be publicly available (Wiley, Green, and Soares, 2012) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> in the {{technology}} domain. In contrast to the common notion of openness as transparent access, I define the concept as the degree of liberation or suppression of potentiality. To develop a theory of openness as potentiality, I draw on the works of Gilbert Simondon and Umberto Eco. Simondon’s theory of individuation explains the potentiality of incompatible relations between disparate domains. Resolving the incompatibilities actualizes the underlying potentiality, which is the energy source of constant, ambivalent changes in the lifeworld. Eco suggests that the semantic codes in contemporary art are unstable. They constantly oscillate between the rejection and the preservation of conventional systems. By appropriating Simondon’s and Eco’s theory {{to the realm of}} technology, I formulate a theory of openness in technology. I conclude with an inquiry on the significance of openness in practice and propose a design approach for developing open technologies...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose the useful {{theories}} for designing and evaluating the space <b>of</b> gardens. The <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> degree <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> for an element of space, the system of partition between one element and the other element, and edge of each element or space were defined and discussed. Each definition is following: degree of openness=(length of fittings such as sliding doors) /(perimeter length of building) Edge is the border between one physical element of space and the other physical element of space. The system of partition was defined by its material and stratum. Applicability and validity of the theory provided by these definitions to actual and concrete spaces were examined. The conclusion is following: 1. Degree <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> is related to the type and use of neighboring building. Which direction a garden was situated relates to degree <b>of</b> <b>openness.</b> 2. A personal habit and custom have an effect on partition system. The habit and custom should be forgotten to make garden spaces more interesting. 3. The person walking in a garden sometimes skips or avoids the edges...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, Karl Popper's {{paradigm}} <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> and closure {{is employed}} {{in order to}} investigate organisational culture in German corporations with respect to three issues: (1) whether organisational culture tends to correspond to or contradict the pattern of peer-group, or concertive, control that has recently been identified in organisations; (2) to what extent organisational cultures in Germany match German national culture; and (3) how German corporations react to the dilemma of being constrained by the extremes <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> and closure. In doing so, the position of German corporations are identified {{in relation to the}} <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> and closure. With regard to the first issue, the current discourse on concertive control in critical organisation studies is outlined, and fourteen German manufacturing companies are investigated employing a questionnaire. Two broad clusters of organisational cultures are identified and it is concluded that one cluster matches the pattern of concertive control, whereas the other does not. With regard to the second issue, German national culture is outlined on the basis of secondary sources. Drawing on the organisational cultures identified, it turns out that they considerably correspond to national culture. With respect to the third issue, two kinds of company-internal differentiation, interfunctional and interdimensional, are investigated as possible mechanisms of reacting to the dilemma. Interdimensional differentiation is ascertained to be the preferred strategy. The question of whether German corporations tend towards openness or closure is answered by referring to the two identified clusters of organisational culture. One cluster has considerable traits of closure, whereas the other is more open...|$|R
