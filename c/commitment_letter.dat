Ashley was having a tough time making the decision between UConn and Duke. Her AAU friends Maria and Diana had already committed to UConn so she decided to follow them there. Ashley’s freshman year at UConn started out great. She consistently got playing time until she was injured her elbow in a game against Miami.

50|$|In the U.S., market flex {{language}} drives initial pricing levels. Before formally {{launching a}} loan to these retail accounts, arrangers will often get a market read by informally polling select investors to gauge their appetite for the credit. After this market read, the arrangers will launch the deal at a spread and fee that it thinks will clear the market. Once the pricing, or the initial {{spread over a}} base rate (usually LIBOR), was set, it was largely fixed, except in the most extreme cases. If the loans were undersubscribed, the arrangers {{could very well be}} left above their desired hold level. Since the 1998 Russian financial crisis roiled the market, however, arrangers have adopted market-flex contractual language, which allows them to change the pricing of the loan based on investor demand— in some cases within a predetermined range— and to shift amounts between various tranches of a loan.

50|$|In the United States, {{depository}} {{institutions are}} subject to risk-based capital guidelines issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB). These guidelines are used to evaluate capital adequacy based primarily on the perceived credit risk associated with balance sheet assets, as well as certain off-balance sheet exposures such as unfunded loan <b>commitments,</b> <b>letters</b> of credit, and derivatives and foreign exchange contracts. The risk-based capital guidelines are supplemented by a leverage ratio requirement. To be adequately capitalized under federal bank regulatory agency definitions, a bank holding company must have a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 4%, a combined Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital ratio of at least 8%, and a leverage ratio of at least 4%, and {{not be subject to}} a directive, order, or written agreement to meet and maintain specific capital levels. To be well-capitalized under federal bank regulatory agency definitions, a bank holding company must have a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6%, a combined Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital ratio of at least 10%, and a leverage ratio of at least 5%, and not be subject to a directive, order, or written agreement to meet and maintain specific capital levels. These capital ratios are reported quarterly on the Call Report or Thrift Financial Report. Although Tier 1 capital has traditionally been emphasized, in the Late-2000s recession regulators and investors began to focus on tangible common equity, which is different from Tier 1 capital in that it excludes preferred equity.|$|R

USEC will have responsibility for the demonstration testing and commercial implementation of the plant. The demonstration testing and initial commercial implementation of the technology will be achieved by means of a USEC work authorization task with the Bechtel Jacobs Corporation.

All the large cities of the country, from New York City to Dubuque; from New Orleans to Quebec City, were to become witnesses of his zeal. New Orleans was the first conspicuous field of his success, as he preached the traditional sermons for Lent in the cathedral there. As would become the pattern of his mission, the preaching ended with the founding of a temperance society as a collective social <b>commitment.</b> In a <b>letter</b> to a friend he later noted that their success “exceeded all expectations,” despite his apprehensions. While on his way there, from his own personal funds he contributed one-third of the money with which the Fathers of Mercy bought Spring Hill College (later a Jesuit institution) near Mobile, Alabama, thereby establishing their presence in the country. Forbin-Janson then attended the Fourth Provincial Council of Baltimore, held May 1840, where the Council Fathers granted him a right to vote.|$|R
