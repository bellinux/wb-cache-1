50|$|The brand {{began in}} 1954 {{under the name}} realist, but was {{subsequently}} changed due to a prior camera trademark, Stereo Realist. The company's most notable products under the Realistic brand included the extensive line of TRC series <b>Citizens</b> <b>Band</b> radio <b>transceivers,</b> which dominated the CB Radio market during the 1970s, and included the Navaho series of CB base station units. A 1977 motion picture entitled Handle with Care was sponsored at the time by Tandy Corporation, in part to showcase the line. Also notable were their 8-track tape recorders under the TR- model line and their compact cassette decks under the SCT- model line. They are also the company responsible for the Realistic Mach speaker line. A very wide range of products was marketed under the Realistic brand. These included record players, stereo receivers, cassette decks, ham radios, musical synthesizers and a few quadraphonic receivers and shortwave radios.|$|R
