50|$|To form {{an image}} of the antenna above it, the ground plane need not be {{grounded}} to the Earth. Many antenna types, such as reflective array antennas, use flat surfaces of metal or metal screen to reflect radio waves from the antenna elements, and these can be analyzed using image antennas. If {{there is more than one}} reflective surface in the antenna, as in a <b>corner</b> <b>reflector</b> <b>antenna,</b> each surface forms its own image of the antenna elements. In order to form an image, the ground plane surface must generally have dimensions of at least a quarter-wavelength of the radio waves used.|$|E
50|$|All {{practical}} antennas are {{at least}} somewhat directional, although usually only the direction in the plane parallel to the earth is considered, and practical antennas can easily be omnidirectional in one plane. The most common types are the Yagi antenna, the log-periodic antenna, and the <b>corner</b> <b>reflector</b> <b>antenna,</b> which are frequently combined and commercially sold as residential TV antennas. Cellular repeaters often make use of external directional antennas to give a far greater signal than can be obtained on a standard cell phone. Satellite Television receivers usually use parabolic antennas. For long and medium wavelength frequencies, tower arrays are used in most cases as directional antennas.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>corner</b> <b>reflector</b> <b>antenna</b> {{is a type}} of {{directional}} antenna used at VHF and UHF frequencies. It was invented by John D. Kraus in 1938. It consists of a dipole driven element mounted in front of two flat rectangular reflecting screens joined at an angle, usually 90°. [...] Corner reflectors have moderate gain of 10-15 dB, high front-to-back ratio of 20-30 dB, and wide bandwidth. They are widely used for UHF television receiving antennas, point-to-point communication links and data links for wireless WANs, and amateur radio antennas on the 144, 420, and 1296 MHz bands. [...] They radiate linearly polarized radio waves and can be mounted for either horizontal or vertical polarization.|$|E
50|$|The single {{driven element}} can be {{replaced}} by a Yagi array. UHF Yagi television antennas very often use a <b>corner</b> <b>reflector.</b> These <b>antennas</b> actually function more like two separate antennas: the <b>corner</b> <b>reflector</b> and driven element serves to provide broad bandwidth gain {{at the lower end of}} the UHF band, while the Yagi array is cut to give extra gain at the high end of the band.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{introduces}} a low power transceiver based approach at extending Mobile communication services to rural areas {{without the use}} of conventional base stations. A hamlet cell arrangement is proposed for the clusters or hamlets of the rural areas eliminating the need of having coverage in unpopulated areas like rivers, mountains and forest. The system utilized a low power transceiver designed to be powered by solar cells. The Transceivers provide coverage to the hamlets by the use of <b>corner</b> <b>reflector</b> <b>antennas</b> and these hamlets are linked to the nearest base station by directional antennas.

40|$|Parabolic {{symmetric}} and offset <b>reflector</b> <b>antennas</b> adaptively illuminated using a novel triple-mode feedhorn (TE 11 +TM 01 +TE 21) {{with different}} mode combinations and impedance and radiation performances are presented. The {{combination of the}} radiating modes in a feedhorn with proper amplitude and fixed phase values helps in electronically pointing the main beam of the radiating patterns such as that obtained in a beam-steering antenna with limited beam-scan range. This type of radiation performance virtually creates a displaced phase center location for the feedhorn, which, consequently, adaptively illuminates the <b>reflector</b> <b>antenna</b> surface. Impedance-matching bandwidths are preserved for both <b>reflector</b> <b>antennas</b> similar {{to the case of}} feedhorn alone. The copolarization gain and peak cross-polarization levels are far better with the offset <b>reflector</b> <b>antenna</b> than the symmetric <b>reflector</b> <b>antenna.</b> Such <b>reflector</b> <b>antennas</b> find applications in ground moving target indicator (GMTI) and space based radars.

40|$|<b>Reflector</b> <b>antenna</b> {{design is}} a mature field and most aspects were studied. However, of that most {{previous}} work is distinguished {{by the fact}} that it is narrow in scope, analyzing only a particular problem under certain conditions. Methods of analysis of this type are not useful for working on real-life problems since they can not handle the many and various types of perturbations of basic antenna design. The idea of an integrated design and analysis is proposed. By broadening the scope of the analysis, it becomes possible to deal with the intricacies attendant with modem <b>reflector</b> <b>antenna</b> design problems. The concept of integrated <b>reflector</b> <b>antenna</b> design is put forward. A number of electromagnetic problems related to <b>reflector</b> <b>antenna</b> design are investigated. Some of these show how tools for <b>reflector</b> <b>antenna</b> design are created. In particular, a method for estimating spillover loss for open-ended waveguide feeds is examined. The problem of calculating and optimizing beam efficiency (an important figure of merit in radiometry applications) is also solved. Other chapters deal with applications of this general analysis. The wide angle scan abilities of <b>reflector</b> <b>antennas</b> is examined and a design is proposed for the ATDRSS triband <b>reflector</b> <b>antenna.</b> The development of a general phased-array pattern computation program is discussed and how the concept of integrated design can be extended to other types of antennas is shown.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{new techniques}} for simultaneous localization of multiple mobile robots using di-rectional received signal strength (RSS). The RSS data is {{collected from the}} XBee wireless module with ZigBee technology. Directional RSS was achieved by a <b>corner</b> <b>reflector</b> <b>antenna</b> installed {{on the top of}} each mobile robot. The design parameters of the antenna were chosen by experiments and physical constraints of the robots. To map the RSS data to physical distance values, we first filtered the data using the well-known RANdom Sample Consen-sus (RANSAC) technique and then applied the least square regression method to further remove a large amount of outliers. In addition, real-time multi-robot localization and path planning are achieved by using an online statis-tical filter. The algorithm first identifies well-conditioned RSS values and sets a dynamic step size for trajectory generation. The online statistical filter was experimentally evaluated by comparing with two other algorithms, i. e., the Kalman and particle filters, and showed better performance than the other filters in terms of processing time. Preliminary evaluation on the directivity achieved by the corner reflector revealed that the mean orientation error of − 4. 01 ◦.

40|$|PhDThis thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} the radiation characteristics of corner reflector antennas. The influence of the design parameters on the radiation characteristics are assessed using an analytical method and the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method. The FDTD method for corner reflector antennas which are electrically small to medium sized antennas is developed in detail. The important subject of the Absorbing Boundary Conditions (ABCs) is studied including a study of Mur ABC and Perfectly Matched Layers. It is shown that both methods reduce the reflections from the boundaries sufficient so that the far-field radiation pattern can be computed accurately. An analytical solution to compute the far-field radiation pattern for infinite comer reflector antennas is derived and used to understand the radiation mechanisms. Based on those results, the FDTD method is used to conduct a parametric study on finite sized comer reflector antennas. Experimental antennas have been built and measured in order to verify the computational predictions. Very good agreement is reported The novel idea of a variable beam-width comer reflector antenna is developed and practical designs of such an antenna are presented. The principle is to design the comer reflector antenna such that the beam-width of the antenna can be precisely modified. Data on the gain and beam-width are presented. This has been done both by computational and by an experimental model. The influence on the performance of the comer reflector antenna when substituting the solid reflector plates by rods has been investigated. The computational predictions have been verified by measurements of an experimental antenna. Very good agreement has been achieved. III[The possibility of modifying the shape of the comer reflector antenna is investigated.
