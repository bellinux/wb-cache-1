25|$|Cholesterol ratio: This ratio {{compares the}} levels of LDL to HDL. Trans fat behaves like {{saturated}} fat by raising the level of LDL, but, unlike saturated fat, it has the additional effect of decreasing levels of HDL. The net increase in LDL/HDL ratio with trans fat is approximately double that due to saturated fat. (Higher ratios are worse.) One randomized <b>crossover</b> <b>study</b> published in 2003 comparing the effect of eating a meal on blood lipids of (relatively) cis and trans fat rich meals showed that cholesteryl ester transfer (CET) was 28% higher after the trans meal than after the cis meal and that lipoprotein concentrations were enriched in apolipoprotein(a) after the trans meals.|$|E
50|$|A popular repeated-measures {{design is}} the <b>crossover</b> <b>study.</b> A <b>crossover</b> <b>study</b> is a {{longitudinal}} study in which subjects receive a sequence of different treatments (or exposures). While crossover studies can be observational studies, many important crossover studies are controlled experiments. Crossover designs are common for experiments in many scientific disciplines, for example psychology, education, pharmaceutical science and health-care, especially medicine.|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews {{nonparametric methods}} for the {{analysis}} of <b>crossover</b> <b>studies.</b> Primary attention is given to <b>crossover</b> <b>studies</b> to compare two treatments for a response variable that has a metric measurement level. For this situation, one can often test hypotheses or obtain confidence intervals for parameters of interest by applying well known univariate nonparametric rank methods (e. g., the Wilcoxon rank sum test, or the Wilcoxon signed rank test) to appropriately specified functions of the data. Related extensions are also available, to some degree, for <b>crossover</b> <b>studies</b> to compare more than two treatments or those for which the measurement level of the response variable is ordinal or has a censored time-to-event nature. Methods for several specific situations along these lines are discussed in terms of principles with potentially broader applicability. Several examples are provided to illustrate the performance of some of the methods...|$|R

We also excluded phase II studies, pilot <b>studies</b> and physiological <b>crossover</b> <b>studies</b> because studies at this stage of clinical research are expected to explore mainly physiological and feasibility outcomes.|$|R
40|$|During drug development, trough {{concentrations}} {{are usually}} monitored following repeated dosing {{to ensure that}} steady state has been achieved. Further utility of this information is explored in the estimation of intrasubject variability, Intrasubject variability {{is essential to the}} determination of sample sizes for planning within-subject (ie, <b>crossover)</b> <b>studies</b> of the effects of meals, concomitant drugs, or formulation changes (ie, bioequivalence). The utility of steady state trough concentration was evaluated as an indicator of intrasub-ject variability compared to a conventional approach of using a fraction of intersubject variability and to estimates obtained directly from <b>crossover</b> <b>studies.</b> Based on available data, estimates of intrasubject variabiliv by the trough concentration approach were comparable to those from the other two approaches...|$|R

40|$|Incomplete data {{is common}} in both {{observational}} studies and clinical trials. Ignoring missing data may produce seriously biased estimators and could lead to misleading results. During the last three decades, {{a vast amount of}} work has been done in this area. The approaches can be classified into the following main categories: imputation methods, likelihood-based methods and inverse probability weighting methods. Longitudinal and <b>crossover</b> <b>studies</b> with repeated measures are particularly subject to missing observations. Various methods, including generalized estimating equations (GEE) (Liang and Zeger, 1986), weighted GEE (WGEE) (Robins, Rotnitzky and Zhao, 1995) and multiple imputations, have been proposed to cope with missing data in longitudinal studies. However, very few researchers have explored the missing data issue in <b>crossover</b> <b>studies.</b> In addition to reviewing and critiquing the methods dealing with missing observations in general and in repeated measures, in this dissertation, we propose a new weighting approach for GEE to estimate the regression parameters in <b>crossover</b> <b>studies.</b> The proposed method provides consistent and asymptotically normally distributed estimators. Simulation and asymptotic efficiency results indicate that the proposed estimators are more efficient than both regular GEE and WGEE. Applications of the proposed method are illustrated with real data...|$|R

40|$|Crossover {{design is}} a type of {{longitudinal}} study with each subject receiving different treatments in different time periods. It has been used frequently in the pharmaceutical industry and other medical fields to investigate the safety and efficacy of new drugs or new treatments. For <b>crossover</b> <b>studies,</b> the treatment effects from the earlier period may be carried over to the later period, which is called the carry-over effect, the response may naturally change over different periods. How to assess treatment effect with accounting for all these features deserves further investigation. Linear mixed-effects (LME) model has been widely applied to analyze data resulted from longitudinal studies. In this project, we model treatment effects, period effects, and carryover effects using the LME for 2 x 2 <b>crossover</b> <b>studies,</b> where all subjects are randomly assigned to two sequences, and each subject is treated subsequently with two treatments, the order of the treatments depends on its sequence. We first investigated the simple 2 x 2 design, where each subject has only one response measurement under each treatment. Extensive simulations were carried out to compare the performance between LME and the traditional Grizzle 2 ̆ 7 s method. We extend the LME to the general 2 x 2 <b>crossover</b> <b>studies,</b> where the response under each treatment is taking over different time point. We applied our model to an endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) study, where each patient was exposed to either air (placebo) first then airborne particular matters (PM) or PM first then air. In each exposure condition, the EPC cells were measured right before the exposure (Pre), right after the exposure (Post), and the second day follow-up (FU).

For hematologic studies, dogs were exposed for 6 hr/day for 3 consecutive days with one receiving CAPs {{while the other}} was simultaneously exposed to filtered air; crossover of exposure took place the following week (<b>crossover</b> <b>studies).</b> Physicochemical characterization of CAPs exposure samples included measurements of particle mass, size distribution, and composition.
