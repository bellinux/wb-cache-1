5|$|Later test {{explosions of}} nuclear weapons with houses and other test {{structures}} nearby confirmed the 5 psi overpressure threshold. Ordinary urban buildings experiencing it will be crushed, toppled, or gutted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> of air pressure.

5|$|When a drop {{of falling}} water hits the {{interior}} of the cup with the appropriate angle and velocity, the peridioles are ejected into the air <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> of the drop. The force of ejection tears open the purse, and results in the expansion of the funicular cord, formerly coiled under pressure in {{the lower part of the}} purse. The peridioles, followed by the highly adhesive funicular cord and basal hapteron, may hit a nearby plant stem or stick. The hapteron sticks to it, and the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> of the still-moving peridiole. After drying out, the peridiole remains attached to the vegetation, where it may be eaten by a grazing herbivorous animal, and later deposited in that animal's dung to continue the life cycle.|$|E
5|$|Aside from rubber collection, {{violence}} in the Free State chiefly occurred in connection with wars and rebellions. Native states, notably Msiri's Yeke Kingdom, the Zande Federation, and Swahili-speaking territory in the eastern Congo under Tippu Tip, refused to recognise colonial authority and were defeated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Force</b> Publique with great brutality, during the Congo Arab war. In 1895, a military mutiny broke out among the Batetela in Kasai, leading to a 4-year insurgency. The conflict was particularly brutal and caused {{a great number of}} casualties.|$|E

5|$|Chlorine gas {{was also}} used during the Iraq War in Anbar Province in 2007, with insurgents packing truck bombs with mortar shells and {{chlorine}} tanks. The attacks killed two people from the explosives and sickened more than 350. Most of the deaths were caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> of the explosions rather than the effects of chlorine since the toxic gas is readily dispersed and diluted in the atmosphere by the blast. In some bombings, over a hundred civilians were hospitalized due to breathing difficulties. The Iraqi authorities tightened security for elemental chlorine, which is essential for providing safe drinking water to the population.|$|E
5|$|Dennis Oglesby and Martin Griffith, two United States Army {{soldiers}} {{who were in the}} lead train and were uninjured in the collision, helped passengers, most of whom appeared to have minor injuries, evacuate from their train. Oglesby and Griffith then noticed that six to eight people from the other train had been ejected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> of the collision and were more seriously injured. One person from the overtaking train had been thrown onto the roof of the stationary train and had suffered a severe head wound. The soldiers gave first aid to the more seriously injured victims until help arrived, and informed responding emergency personnel that the rails were still powered and needed to be shut down.|$|E
5|$|Dunbeth hill {{where the}} present local {{authority}} municipal buildings stand is {{a wedge of}} rock which was probably squeezed upwards <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> of two (now-extinct) fault lines.

5|$|During the Japanese {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, Arizona was bombed. After a bomb detonated in a powder magazine, the {{battleship}} exploded violently and sank, {{with the loss}} of 1,177officers and crewmen. Unlike many of the other ships sunk or damaged that day, Arizona was irreparably damaged <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> of the magazine explosion, though the Navy removed parts of the ship for reuse. The wreck still lies at the bottom of Pearl Harbor and the USS Arizona Memorial, dedicated on 30 May 1962 to all those who died during the attack, straddles the ship's hull.|$|E
5|$|In Fairfield, Idaho, two janitors witness an {{invisible}} force storm down a city street; a road worker is later killed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> on the highway.

The driver manages to stop in time, but the elephant soon collapses and dies, over forty miles away from where it disappeared the night before at the Fairfield Zoo.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes {{hit back}} in the second session on Friday night, with Nico Rosberg leading his {{teammate}} Lewis Hamilton by about a tenth of a second. The Ferraris were about half a second behind, with Räikkönen again the faster of the two. It was another dismal session for Jenson Button who had to park his car halfway through the session, though he was able to come back for a couple of laps {{towards the end of the}} session. A late red flag came out when Vettel, braking slowly into turn one, was clipped <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Force</b> India of Sergio Pérez, taking off part of his front wing endplate.|$|E

5|$|Mercedes {{were the}} only team to use the medium tyre in the first {{qualifying}} session (Q1), with all other teams using the faster soft tyre. Five drivers were eliminated in Q1, four of them being the two Marussia and McLaren cars, all of which had yet failed to go through to Q2. They were joined <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Force</b> India of Nico Hülkenberg, who was to start 16th on the grid.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} case {{of static}} equilibrium occurs when two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. For example, an object {{on a level}} surface is pulled (attracted) downward {{toward the center of}} the Earth <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> of gravity. At the same time, a force is applied by the surface that resists the downward force with equal upward force (called a normal force). The situation produces zero net force and hence no acceleration.|$|E
5|$|Downburst winds {{can produce}} {{numerous}} hazards to landscapes experiencing thunderstorms. Downburst winds are generally very powerful, {{and are often}} mistaken for wind speeds produced by tornadoes, due to the concentrated amount of force exerted by their straight-horizontal characteristic. Downburst winds can be hazardous to unstable, incomplete, or weakly constructed infrastructures and buildings. Agricultural crops, and other plants in nearby environments can be uprooted and damaged. Aircraft engaged in takeoff or landing can crash. Automobiles can be displaced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> exerted by downburst winds. Downburst winds are usually formed in areas when high pressure air systems of downdrafts begin to sink and displace the air masses below it, due to their higher density. When these downdrafts reach the surface, they spread out and turn into the destructive straight-horizontal winds.|$|E

5|$|Droits de l'Homme was irreparably damaged, {{and many}} of the men on board were {{soldiers}} with no training for what to do {{in the event of a}} shipwreck. Each successive wave swept more men into the water and desperate attempts to launch boats failed when the small craft were swept away by the waves and broken in the surf. Rafts were constructed, but several were swamped in attempts to carry a rope to the shore. The men on the one raft that remained upright were forced to cut the rope to prevent them from foundering in the heavy seas. Some of the men on this raft reached the beach, the first survivors of the wreck. Subsequent attempts were made by individuals to swim to shore with ropes, but they were either drowned or driven back to the ship <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> of the sea.|$|E
5|$|Leeboard: To avoid leeward drift caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> of wind while sailing, the {{leeboard}} was invented; {{it was a}} board lowered {{onto the}} side of the ship opposite to the direction of the wind, helping the ship to stay upright and on course. Paul Johnstone and Sean McGrail state that an odd-looking second paddle on a bronze drum of the Dong Son culture (centered in the Red River Delta of northern Vietnam) may depict a leeboard in use as early as 300 BC. Leeboards may have been invented in China as early as the 8th century during the Tang Dynasty and are featured shortly after in 9th century engraved artwork found at the Borobudur monument built during the Sailendra dynasty of Central Java (Indonesia). Leeboards were first used in the West by the Dutch, during the 15th to 16th centuries (possibly used on early Dutch cogs, or perhaps influenced by a Chinese origin).|$|E
5|$|Special {{abilities}} and actions are controlled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Force</b> Gauge, an energy meter which determines how long special {{skills can be}} active. Once drained, the skill cannot be activated until the meter refills, which it does during battles. Four skills can be equipped for each character. After battles, characters earn Enhancement Points (EP), {{which can be used}} to strengthen equipped armor, weapons and accessories, instead of using Gald (the in-game currency) as with previous Tales titles. EP can be transferred between weapons. An optional battle arena was added in the PSP version of the game with both single-player and multiplayer matches: in both modes, players need to defeat an enemy team (either AI-controlled enemies or an opposing team) within a time limit.|$|E

5|$|The Falcon {{journeys}} to the Rebel base at Yavin IV, {{where the}} Rebels analyze the Death Star plans {{and find a}} weakness. Luke joins the assault team while Han collects his reward for the rescue and prepares to leave. The Rebel fighters attack the Death Star but suffer heavy losses during the assault. During his run, Luke hears Obi-Wan's voice telling him to use the Force, and he turns off his targeting computer. Vader appears with his own group of fighters, {{and is about to}} fire at Luke's starfighter when Han arrives in the Falcon and attacks Vader and his men, sending Vader's ship off into space. Guided <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Force,</b> Luke fires into the port, destroying the Death Star, and he returns to the Rebel base with his friends to celebrate their victory.|$|E
5|$|The cone shaped fruiting body of Cyathus striatus {{makes use}} of a splash-cup {{mechanism}} to help disperse the spores. When a raindrop hits {{the interior of the}} cup with the optimal angle and velocity, the downward force of the water ejects the peridioles into the air. The force of ejection rips open the funiculus, releasing the tightly wound funicular cord. The hapteron attached {{to the end of the}} funiculus is adhesive, and when it contacts a nearby plant stem or stick, the hapteron sticks to it; the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> of the still-moving peridiole (similar to a tetherball). The peridioles degrade over time to eventually release the spores within, or they may be eaten by herbivorous animals and redeposited after passing through the digestive tract.|$|E
5|$|The first {{contingent}} of police enlisted for a three-year term of service, but later recruits enlisted for five year periods, {{with the possibility}} of their purchasing an early discharge. Early in the force's history, the training of recruits was carried out on an ad hoc basis at the police's headquarters; in response, a depot for training new recruits created in Regina in 1885, based on the Royal Irish Constabulary Depot in Dublin, which took a much more structured approach. The use of the depot declined in line with the reduced number of new recruits joining the force after 1895, and was ultimately replaced by the new School of Instruction in 1899. Efforts were taken throughout the 1880s and 1890s {{to improve the quality of}} recruits being accepted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>force,</b> and to tackle the related problems of early discharge and desertion, which was making staff retention a serious problem.|$|E
