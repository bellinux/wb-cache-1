5|$|Lafarge Aggregates owns various {{sites in}} the parish. In 1974 the village won an appeal against Pioneer Concrete's {{application}} for gravel extraction near the village. Similar events took place in March 2003 when hundreds of local residents protested against an application of gravel extraction by Lafarge. Larfarge's initial appeal, in April 2003, was turned down by West Berkshire Council. A further application to extract aggregate at the Wasing Estate was due to be decided in 2010. One former extraction site, Butts Lake Quarry, is now a nature reserve and the flooded lakes {{have been identified as}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest and is now operated by the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust. The reserve contains specimens of trees such as alder, cherry, hawthorn, oak, and willow. Examples of reeds present include typha latifolia, phragmites australis, mentha aquatica, and lythrum salicaria. Numerous species of <b>bird</b> <b>nest</b> in the reserve, including the common teal, shoveler, warbler, kingfisher, water rail, and nightingale.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, Teide National Park {{has only}} a limited variety of {{vertebrate}} fauna. Ten species of <b>bird</b> <b>nest</b> there, including the blue chaffinch (Fringilla teydea teydea), Berthelot's pipit (Anthus berthelotii berthelotii), the Atlantic canary (Serinus canaria) and a subspecies of kestrel (Falco tinnunculus canariensis).|$|E
500|$|The London Natural History Society {{suggest that}} London is [...] "one of the World's Greenest Cities" [...] {{with more than}} 40 percent green space or open water. They {{indicate}} that 2000 species of flowering plant have been found growing there and that the tidal Thames supports 120 species of fish. They also state that over 60 species of <b>bird</b> <b>nest</b> in central London and that their members have recorded 47 species of butterfly, 1173 moths and more than 270 kinds of spider around London. London's wetland areas support nationally important populations of many water birds. London has 38 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), two National Nature Reserves and 76 Local Nature Reserves.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to their use in soup, edible <b>bird's</b> <b>nests</b> {{can be used as}} an ingredient in many other dishes, they can be cooked with rice to produce <b>bird's</b> <b>nest</b> congee or <b>bird's</b> <b>nest</b> boiled rice, or they can be added to egg tarts and other desserts. A <b>bird's</b> <b>nest</b> jelly can be made by placing the <b>bird's</b> <b>nest</b> in a ceramic container with minimal water and sugar (or salt) and double steamed. Ready-to-eat <b>bird's</b> <b>nest</b> jelly is available in jars as a commercial product.|$|R

500|$|Charles Cohen, on {{the other}} hand, found traces of Horton Hatches the Egg in early Dr. Seuss works. In an early {{installment}} of Geisel's cartoon feature [...] "Boids and the Beasties", which began in Judge magazine in 1927, he juxtaposed a bird and an elephant. A few weeks later, he drew a story in which a whale ends up passed out in a catalpa tree. In a 1959 cartoon for Life magazine, he depicted a dachshund who sits on eggs for storks. In 1961, he drew an illustration for Judge that showed a walrus sitting in a tree, trying to hatch the eggs in a <b>bird</b> <b>nest.</b> Some of his earlier work also featured elephant-bird hybrids, which prefigured the elephant-bird that hatches {{at the end of}} Horton Hatches the Egg.|$|E
500|$|The video commences with {{formally}} dressed spectators {{entering a}} museum as a curator introduces [...] "a creature so rare {{it was believed}} to be extinct. In captivity for the first time, the rarest creature on Earth, Avis Cyrus. White curtains are pulled down to reveal Cyrus, dressed in a black leotard and expansive black CGI wings, asleep in a giant <b>bird</b> <b>nest</b> locked inside a giant cage. Cyrus rises and approaches the audience, but a camera flash startles her and causes her to shield her face with her wings. The music starts, and Cyrus unveils herself again and joins a large group of feathered dancers. As Cyrus sings, she and the dancers escape the cage and prowl the museum, shattering museum exhibits as they pass them. They perform provocative dances both inside the cage and in darkened museum halls. Cut-scenes feature Cyrus lying down, dressed in a silver corset attached to a bed of peacock feathers, or writhing alone in her nest in the cage. The video ends with Cyrus back in her cage and the museum empty and trashed.|$|E
500|$|Also, <b>bird</b> <b>nest.</b> Specialized types: burrow; cavity; cup (adherent [...] cup; statant cup); dome; dormitory; eyries (or aeries); hanging; ledge; mound; pendant; platform; roost (or winter-nest); scrape; saucer or plate; and sphere. The spot {{in which}} a bird lays and incubates its eggs and raises its young. Although the term popularly refers to a {{specific}} structure made by the bird itself—such as the grassy cup nest of the American robin or Eurasian blackbird, or the elaborately woven hanging nest of the Montezuma oropendola or the village weaver—for some species, a nest is simply a shallow depression made in sand; for others, it is the knot-hole left by a broken branch, a burrow dug into the ground, a chamber drilled into a tree, an enormous rotting pile of vegetation and earth, a shelf made of dried saliva or a mud dome with an entrance tunnel. The smallest bird nests are those of some hummingbirds, tiny cups {{which can be a}} mere [...] across and [...] high. At the other extreme, some nest mounds built by the dusky scrubfowl measure more than [...] in diameter and stand nearly [...] tall. Not all bird species build nests. Some species lay their eggs directly on the ground or rocky ledges, while brood parasites lay theirs in the nests of other birds, letting unwitting [...] "foster parents" [...] do all the work of rearing the young. Although nests are primarily used for breeding, they may also be reused in the non-breeding season for roosting and some species build special dormitory nests or roost nests (or winter-nest) that are used only for roosting. Most birds build a new nest each year, though some refurbish their old nests. The large eyries (or aeries) of some eagles are platform nests that have been used and refurbished for several years. In most species, the female does most or all of the nest construction, though the male often helps. In some polygynous species, however, the male does most or all of the nest building. The nest may also form a part of the courtship display such as in weaver birds. The ability to choose and maintain good nest sites and build high quality nests may be selected for by females in these species. In some species the young from previous broods may also act as helpers for the adults.|$|E
5000|$|Edible <b>bird's</b> <b>nests</b> are <b>bird</b> <b>nests</b> {{created by}} edible-nest swiftlets using {{solidified}} saliva, which are harvested for human consumption.

2500|$|A <b>bird</b> <b>nest</b> is {{the spot}} {{in which a}} bird lays and incubates its eggs and raises its young. Although the term popularly refers to a {{specific}} structure made by the bird itself—such as the grassy cup nest of the American robin or Eurasian blackbird, or the elaborately woven hanging nest of the Montezuma oropendola or the village weaver—that is too restrictive a definition. For some species, a nest is simply a shallow depression made in sand; for others, it is the knot-hole left by a broken branch, a burrow dug into the ground, a chamber drilled into a tree, an enormous rotting pile of vegetation and earth, a shelf made of dried saliva or a mud dome with an entrance tunnel.

2500|$|Federal {{regulation}} of falconry in North America is enforced under the statutes of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 (MBTA), {{originally designed to}} address the rampant commercial market hunting of migratory waterbirds during the early 20th century. Birds of prey suffered extreme persecution from the early 20th century through the 1960s, where thousands of birds were shot at conspicuous migration sites and many state wildlife agencies issued bounties for carcasses. [...] Due to widespread persecution and further impacts to raptor populations from DDT and other toxins, the act was amended in 1972 to include birds of prey (eagles are also protected under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act of 1959). Under the MBTA, it is illegal for people to [...] "take" [...] migratory birds, their eggs, feathers or nests. [...] Take is defined in the MBTA to [...] "include by any means or in any manner, any attempt at hunting, pursuing, wounding, killing, possessing or transporting any migratory <b>bird,</b> <b>nest,</b> egg, or part thereof". Falconers are allowed to trap, and otherwise possess certain birds of prey and their feathers with special permits issued by the Migratory Bird Office of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and by state wildlife agencies (issuers of trapping permits).|$|E
