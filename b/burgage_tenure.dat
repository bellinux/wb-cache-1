5000|$|Burgage is {{a medieval}} land term used in England and Wales, Ireland and Scotland, well {{established}} by the 13th century. A burgage was a town ("borough") rental property (to use modern terms), owned by a king or lord. The property ("burgage tenement") usually, and distinctly, consisted of a house on a long and narrow plot of land (Scots: toft), with a narrow street frontage. Rental payment ("tenure") was usually {{in the form of}} money, but each [...] "burgage tenure" [...] arrangement was unique, and could include services. As populations grew, [...] "burgage plots" [...] could be split into smaller additional units. (Amalgamation was not so common, until {{the second half of the}} 19th century.) <b>Burgage</b> <b>tenures</b> were usually money based, in contrast to rural tenures which were usually services based. In Saxon times the rent was called a landgable or hawgable.|$|R

5000|$|As {{for other}} urban centres during the medieval period in Cumbria, {{it has been}} said that [...] "urban life was hardly ever fully developed". Boroughs (defined by <b>burgage</b> <b>tenure),</b> were limited to a few places: Carlisle, Cockermouth, Keswick, Egremont, Ulverston, Dalton, Kendal, Brough, Appleby, and Penrith. There were other market centres which had urban, but non-borough, {{characteristics}} such as Brampton, Alston, Wigton, Workington, Kirkby Lonsdale, and Kirkby Stephen.|$|E
5000|$|A seigneurial borough was an {{administrative}} division of urban government within a manor of medieval England, that granted a town's citizens or burgesses rights of <b>burgage</b> <b>tenure</b> and {{a degree of}} self-government under a charter or prescription granted by the Lord of the Manor. [...] Unlike fully incorporated boroughs, which received their privileges directly from The Crown through a Royal Charter and thus had [...] "no lord but the King", seigniorial boroughs remained dependent on local manorial authority.|$|E
50|$|His brave, if futile conduct, won admiration. He was {{appointed}} a Lord of the Bedchamber to George I on 19 July 1717. He held the post for ten years, although he much preferred country life {{to that of}} London. He was sworn of the Privy Council and appointed Constable of the Tower of London in 1726, but he resigned the constableship in 1731, also because of his desire {{to live in the}} country. During this period, Lowther Hall was badly damaged by fire in 1718, and he spent little time there. In 1720, during the collapse of the South Sea Bubble, he may have lost as much as £30,000, worsening the condition of an estate already weakened by his gambling at cards and on the turf. He also spent significant sums to secure the <b>burgage</b> <b>tenures</b> of Appleby, bringing that borough under the family's control.|$|R

50|$|In the {{description}} of <b>burgage</b> <b>tenure</b> and tenure in villeinage, the life of which consists in the validity of ancient customs recognised by law, we recognise survivals of a time before the iron rule of feudalism had moulded the law {{of land in the}} interests of the king and the great lords. Finally he deals with the law of rents, discussing the various kinds of rents that may be reserved to the grantor upon a grant of lands and the remedies for recovery of rent, especially the remedy by distress.|$|E

5000|$|The {{development}} of the village began in earnest during the 10th century when Frithstan, the Bishop of Winchester, in a chartership dated 909, was granted [...] "Uferantun" [...] by King Edward the Elder. [...] Overton developed over the next century {{and by the time}} of the Doomsday Book the settlement included a large number of dwellings, the Church of St Mary and several corn mills primarily due to its location on the River Test. By the 12C Overton was a significant location with a royal residence, Tidgrove Kings House, being developed just north of Overton. The residence was built for Henry II for use on journeys between Windsor and either Winchester or Hamwych (Southampton) which was the customary port for travel to and from his French possessions [...] The importance and expansion continued throughout the 12th and 13th centuries facilitated in 1218 by Henry III providing a royal grant to the Bishop of Winchester for a market in [...] "his manor of Overton" [...] when <b>burgage</b> <b>tenure</b> was introduced. By this period Overton was becoming a major settlement on the north-south route to and from Winchester.|$|E

At that time alum was important for medicinal uses, in curing leather and for fixing dyed cloths and the Papal States and Spain maintained monopolies on its production and sale. Chaloner secretly brought workmen to develop the industry in Yorkshire, and alum was produced near Sandsend Ness 3 mi from Whitby in the reign of James I. Once the industry was established, imports were banned and although the methods in its production were laborious, England became self-sufficient.Whitby grew significantly as a port {{as a result of the}} alum trade and by importing coal from the Durham coalfield to process it.|$|E
