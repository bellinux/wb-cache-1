5000|$|There are {{therapeutics}} used clinically {{which can}} effect {{the activity of}} P-type calcium channels. However, the primary target of these therapeutics are not thought to be P-type channels. For example, calcium antagonists, which are used to treat coronary heart disease, hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmia, act by inhibiting L-type or T-type calcium channels. Some of these calcium antagonists include verapamil, diltiazem, amlodipine, benidipine, cilnidipine, nicardipine, and <b>barnidipine.</b> Although their main target is not P-type channels, these calcium antagonists also act to block the function of P-type channels. Moreover, flunarizine is another calcium antagonist {{which is used to}} treat migraines. Its main targets are voltage-gated calcium channels and sodium channels. Flunarizine inhibits the P-type channels that are located in the neocortical slices. It works to inhibit the inward flux of calcium. The migraines that it helps to prevent are due to mutations within the [...] "cacna1a" [...] gene of the P-type channel subunit. Also, compounds that block P-type channels are shown to help with seizures. Epileptic seizures are caused by increased neurotransmission, which is partially a result of P-type channels. Compounds such as levetiracetam, lamotrigine, and carbamazepine are known to block the P-type channels, which have helped to decrease the occurrence of seizures. Overall, there are various non-selective calcium channel blockers that help alleviate symptoms of hypertension, schizophrenia, cardiac arrhythmia, epilepsy, pain, asthma, bradycardia, angina pectoris and Alzheimer's disease. Although many of the therapeutic compounds' main target is not P-type channels, further research needs to determine if the clinical effects of these compounds are also influenced by the P-type channel blockage.|$|E

40|$|It {{is rather}} {{the rate of}} the {{vasodilator}} effect than its magnitude which determines the triggering of reflex tachycardia associated with dihydropyridine calcium antagonists (DHP-CA). We therefore compared {{the rate of the}} vasodilator effects of a series of CA (both DHP and non-DHP) in rat isolated mesenteric artery preparations (size 256 +/- 3 microns, length 2 mm) from male Wistar rats (weighing 300 - 350 g) in an isolated wire myograph according to Mulvany and Halpern [12]. The mean force of the KCl-induced contraction amounted to 2. 3 +/- 0. 1 mN/mm. Potency (given as IC 50 -values), differential time course of action and recovery of the contractile response of the vessels after wash-out were established. These three parameters adhere to the following sequences: (1. potency) <b>barnidipine</b> [corrected] > (S) -lercanidipine > <b>barnidipine</b> racemate [corrected]> amlodipine > nifedipine, lacidipine > (R) -lercanidipine > verapamil, mibefradil; (2. differential time course) lacidipine, amlodipine > (S) - and (R) -lercanidipine, <b>barnidipine</b> [corrected], <b>barnidipine</b> racemate [corrected] > mibefradil, verapamil, nifedipine; (3. recovery) nifedipine > verapamil, <b>barnidipine</b> [corrected], amlodipine > <b>barnidipine,</b> lacidipine > mibefradil, (R) -lercanidipine > (S) -lercanidipine. In conclusion, <b>barnidipine</b> [corrected] proved to be the most potent vasodilator agent; interestingly, <b>barnidipine</b> was 20 times less potent when applied as a racemic mixture. A slow onset of action in DHP is a very important mechanism in preventing reflex tachycardia. For non-DHP (verapamil, mibefradil) reflex tachycardia probably is prevented by a direct effect on the conductive tissue in the myocardiu...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>barnidipine</b> and {{nifedipine}} on L-type Ca 2 + current (ICa(L)) were investigated in ventricular cardiomyocytes from rats. Both <b>barnidipine</b> and nifedipine reduced ICa(L) in a concentration and voltage dependent manner; the EC 50 were 80 and 130 [*]nM at a holding potential of − 80 [*]mV, respectively, and 18 and 6 [*]nM at − 40 [*]mV, respectively. Both drugs induced a leftward {{shift of the}} steady-state inactivation curve of ICa(L). Using a twin pulse protocol, {{the relationships between the}} amount of block of ICa(L) by either drug, seen during the second pulse, and the length of the first pulse were described by monoexponential functions reflecting onset of block, dependent on drug concentration. The onset of block by <b>barnidipine</b> was three times faster than that by nifedipine. With both drugs, recovery of ICa(L) was 50 times slower than under control conditions and described by monoexponential functions reflecting offset of block (independent of drug concentration). The offset of block with <b>barnidipine</b> was three times slower than that with nifedipine. The time constants of block and unblock of ICa(L) by both drugs were used to calculate binding and unbinding and to predict their effects at two frequencies.

40|$|Background. In {{hypertensive}} patients, endothelial dysfunction {{is associated}} with an increased incidence of cardiovascular events. Calcium-channel antagonists can reverse impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation in different vascular districts, while confl icting results are found in the brachial artery. Aim. To investigate the effect of <b>barnidipine</b> in comparison with hydrochlorothiazide on endothelial function of hypertensives, as assessed by fl ow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) of the brachial artery. Methods. Patients with mild to moderate hypertension (age range 26 – 67 years) were randomized to receive <b>barnidipine</b> or hydrochlorothiazide. A thorough clinical examination, including blood pressure (BP) measurement, was performed at randomization as well as after 6, 12 and 24 weeks. FMD and 24 -h BP monitoring was performed at randomization, after 12 and 24 weeks. Results. After 12 and 24 weeks of treatment, a signifi cant reduction in clinic BP was observed in both groups. Furthermore, a signifi cant reduction in 24 -h SBP and DBP was observed in patients receiving <b>barnidipine</b> but not in those receiving diuretic. The percentage change in FMD was different between the two groups of patients treated with <b>barnidipine</b> (at 12 weeks 1. 2 2. 2 %, p 0. 023 and at 24 weeks 1. 25 3. 15 %, p 0. 16 from baseline) or with hydrochlorothiazide (at 12 weeks 1. 0 3. 0. p 0. 09 and at 24 weeks 1. 78 2. 9 %, p 0. 015 from baseline). A signifi cant difference in FMD changes between the two groups was confi rmed by analysis of covariance (p 0. 031). Conclusions. In presence of a similar clinic BP reduction, an improvement of endothelial function was observed during treatment with <b>barnidipine</b> but not with hydrochlorothiazide, suggesting that the <b>barnidipine</b> may exert a favourable effect on endothelial dysfunction in hypertensive patients...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that the number of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) refl ects the endogenous vascular repair ability, with the EPCs pool declining in the presence of cardiovascular risk factors. However, their relationship with hypertension and the effects of anti-hypertensive treatment remain unclear. We randomized 29 patients with mild essential hypertension to receive <b>barnidipine</b> up to 20 mg or hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) up to 25 mg. Circulating EPCs were isolated from peripheral blood at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of treatment. Mononuclear cells were cultured with endothelial basal medium supplemented with EGM SingleQuots. EPCs were identifi ed by positive double staining for both FITC-labeled Ulex europaeus agglutinin I and Dil-labeled acethylated low-density lipoprotein. After 3 and 6 months of treatment, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) were signifi cantly reduced. No difference was observed between drugs. An {{increase in the number of}} EPCs was observed after 3 and 6 months of anti-hypertensive treatment (p " 0. 05). <b>Barnidipine</b> signifi cantly increased EPCs after 3 and 6 months of treatment, whereas no effect was observed with HCT. No statistically signifi cant correlation was observed between EPCs and clinical BP values. Our data suggest that antihypertensive treatment may increase the number of EPCs. However, we observed a different effect of <b>barnidipine</b> and HCT on EPCs, suggesting that, beyond its BP lowering effect, <b>barnidipine</b> may elicit additional benefi cial properties, related to a healthier vasculature...|$|E

Objective: The aim of our study was to compare the antihypertensive effect of the dihydropyridine calcium antagonists <b>barnidipine</b> and amlodipine. Methods: This was a 24 -week, randomized, open-label, pilot study. Consecutive treatment-naive patients with grade I or II essential hypertension (office sitting systolic blood pressure [BP] of 140 – 179 mm Hg and diastolic BP of 90 – 109 mm Hg) were enrolled. The primary end points were the effect of treatment with either <b>barnidipine</b> 10 mg or amlodipine 5 mg once daily on office and ambulatory BP, left ventricular mass index (LVMI), and markers of cardiac damage, serum procollagen type I C-terminal propeptide, and plasma amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide concentrations. Patients were assessed at enrollment, and 12 and 24 weeks. During each visit, the prevalence of adverse events (AEs) was also monitored using spontaneous reporting, patient interview, and physical examination, the relationship to study drug being determined by the investigators. Compliance with treatment was assessed at each study visit by counting returned tablets. Results: Thirty eligible patients (20 men, 10 women; mean [SD] age, 47 [12] years) were included in the study; all patients completed the 24 weeks of study treatment. Twelve weeks after randomization, 6 patients in the amlodipine group had their dose doubled to 10 mg due to inadequate BP control. Mean BP reductions at study end were not significantly different between the <b>barnidipine</b> and amlodipine groups (office BP, − 10. 3 /− 9. 4 vs − 16. 6 /− 9. 1 mm Hg; ambulatory BP, 9. 4 / 6. 4 vs 8. 1 / 5. 1 mm Hg). Reductions in LVMI and markers of cardiac damage were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Significantly more patients in the amlodipine group reported drug-related AEs compared with those in the <b>barnidipine</b> group (9 [60 %] vs 2 [13 %]; P < 0. 05). Conclusion: In this small sample of treatment-naive hypertensive patients, the antihypertensive effect of <b>barnidipine</b> 10 mg once daily was not significantly different from that of amlodipine 5 to 10 mg once daily...|$|E
40|$|This open-label, {{blinded study}} was {{performed}} to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of <b>barnidipine</b> at a titrated dose of 10 – 15 mg once daily for 8 weeks {{in the treatment of}} essential hypertension in 40 Thai patients. ‘Office ’ blood pressure (BP) and 24 -h ambulatory BP measure-ments were recorded. A systolic BP/ diastolic BP (SBP/DBP) reduction of 18. 0 ± 13. 6 / 9. 1 ± 6. 6 mmHg was obtained. The full response rate among patients with systolic and diastolic hypertension was 63 % using either SBP or DBP criteria, and 54 % using both SBP and DBP criteria. One of the two patients with isolated systolic hypertension had a full response, and the BP in two of the three patients with isolated diastolic hypertension was normalized.

40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: Increasing {{the dose}} or adding a second {{antihypertensive}} agent are 2 possible therapeutic choices when blood pressure (BP) is poorly controlled with monotherapy. OBJECTIVE: This {{study investigated the}} effectiveness and tolerability of <b>barnidipine</b> 10 or 20 mg added to losartan 50 mg versus losartan 100 mg alone in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension whose BP was uncontrolled by losartan 50 -mg monotherapy. METHODS: This was a 12 -week, multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group study. Eligible patients (aged 30 - 74 years) had uncontrolled hypertension, defined as office sitting diastolic BP (DBP) > or = 90 mm Hg and/or systolic BP (SBP) > or = 140 mm Hg, and mean daytime DBP > or = 85 mm Hg and/or SBP > or = 135 mm Hg. All were being treated with losartan 50 mg at enrollment. After a 1 -week run-in period while taking losartan 50 mg, patients {{were randomly assigned to}} 6 weeks of treatment with open-label <b>barnidipine</b> 10 mg plus losartan 50 mg or losartan 100 -mg monotherapy. At the end of this period, patients with uncontrolled BP had <b>barnidipine</b> doubled to 20 mg and continued for an additional 6 weeks, whereas patients not achieving control on treatment with losartan 100 mg were discontinued. Office BP was measured at each visit, whereas 24 -hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) was performed at randomization and at the final visit (ie, after 12 weeks of treatment, or at 6 weeks for patients not controlled on losartan 100 mg). The intent-to-treat population included all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study treatment and had valid ABPM recordings at baseline and the final visit. The primary end point was the change in daytime DBP between baseline and 12 weeks of treatment, compared between the combination treatment and monotherapy.

40|$|AbstractBackground: <b>Barnidipine</b> {{is one of}} a new {{generation}} of dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers. Despite evidence of favorable effects on blood pressure (BP) and insulin sensitivity, this drug has rarely been tested in hypertensive patients with metabolic syndrome (MS). Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of <b>barnidipine</b> on BP and left ventricular (LV) diastolic function in patients with hypertension and MS. Methods: Consecutive subjects aged 18 to 75 years with systolic BP (SBP) of 140 to 179 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP (DBP) of 90 to 109 mm Hg and MS (based on Adult Treatment Panel III criteria) were assessed for inclusion in the study. Lifestyle changes according to current guidelines were recommended and <b>barnidipine</b> monotherapy 10 mg daily was initiated. All patients entered a 2 -week run-in period. After a 6 -week treatment period, the daily dosage was doubled for the remainder of the study in patients whose BP remained uncontrolled (≥ 140 /≥ 90 mm Hg). We assessed the glycolipidic profile and LV structure and function using standard Doppler and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) echocardiography before and after 12 weeks of treatment. Ambulatory BP records and electrocardiographic and echocardiographic tracings were coded and shipped to a central laboratory for blinded analysis. Possible adverse events (AEs) were recorded at predetermined intervals throughout the follow-up period and at unplanned intervals whenever an AE became known to the investigators. Results: Thirty-four consecutive patients were assessed for inclusion. Thirty consecutive patients (20 men, 10 women; mean {SD| age, 55. 9 { 10. 3 | years; 5 current smokers) were included in the study. At study entry, mean office SBP was 146 mm Hg, DBP was 87 mm Hg, and heart rate was 72 beats/min. At the study end, mean office SBP/DBP was < 140 / 90 mm Hg in 20 patients (66. 7 %). From baseline to study end, 24 -hour ambulatory BP decreased significantly by 12 and 8 mm Hg for SBP and DBP, respectively (both, P = 0. 001). The smoothness index was 0. 92 for SBP and 0. 82 for DBP. Fasting plasma glucose concentration decreased significantly from 110 to 104 mg/dL (P = 0. 001). Total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations did not change significantly. From baseline to study end, there were no significant changes in LV structure or systolic function (LV mass, 50. 7 vs 50. 6 g/ht 2. 7; LV diastolic/systolic diameters, 47. 50 / 29. 80 vs 48. 40 / 30. 76 mm; wall motion score index, 1. 0 vs 1. 0; ejection fraction, 61 % vs 60 %), while the peak E/A velocity ratio on TDI increased from 1. 078 to 1. 245 (P = 0. 009). No AEs (including AEs reflected by chemistry values) either unrelated or related to treatment were noted during the 12 -week duration of the study. Conclusions: In these hypertensive patients with MS, a 12 -week treatment period with <b>barnidipine</b> in addition to lifestyle modifications was associated with significant reductions in 24 -hour BP and BP variability, reduction in plasma glucose concentration, and improvement in LV diastolic relaxation.

Objective: The goal {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of a vasodilator-based therapy with the calcium channel blocker <b>barnidipine</b> on arterial stiffness, wave reflection, and left ventricular (LV) performance using an integrated cardiovascular ultrasound approach (including wave intensity analysis). Methods: Newly diagnosed, previously untreated patients with grade 1 or 2 essential hypertension (systolic blood pressure [BP] ≥ 140 and < 180 mm Hg, and/or diastolic BP ≥ 90 and < 110 mm Hg), and with no signs of clinical cardiovascular disease, were eligible for study. Carotid artery mechanics were investigated at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of <b>barnidipine</b> therapy (10 – 20 mg once daily, according to an open-label design) using a double-beam carotid ultrasound technique. This provided a simultaneous recording of diameter-derived pressure and flow velocity signals and allowed analysis of wave intensity. Indices of local arterial stiffness and wave reflection, as well as separated forward and backward pressure waves, were estimated. LV geometry, mass, and systolic and diastolic performance were also assessed using Doppler echocardiography. All ultrasound examinations and readings were performed by investigators blinded to patient demographics and treatment phase. Normotensive control subjects (office BP < 140 / 90 mm Hg) were included as a reference group.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Information on {{benefits}} and risks of drugs {{is a key}} element affecting doctors' prescribing decisions. Outreach visits promoting independent information have proved moderately effective in changing prescribing behaviours. OBJECTIVES: Testing the short and long-term effectiveness on general practitioners' prescribing of small groups meetings led by pharmacists. METHODS: Two cluster open randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were carried out in a large scale NHS setting. Ad hoc prepared evidence based material were used considering a therapeutic area approach [...] TEA, with information materials on osteoporosis or prostatic hyperplasia [...] and a single drug oriented approach [...] SIDRO, with information materials on me-too drugs of 2 different classes: <b>barnidipine</b> or prulifloxacin. In each study, all 115 Primary Care Groups in a Northern Italy area (2. 2 million inhabitants, 1737 general practitioners) were randomised to educational small groups meetings, in which available evidence was provided together with drug utilization data and clinical scenarios. Main outcomes were changes in the six-months prescription of targeted drugs. Longer term results (24 and 48 months) were also evaluated. RESULTS: In the TEA trial, one of the four primary outcomes showed a reduction (prescription of alfuzosin compared to tamsulosin and terazosin in benign prostatic hyperplasia: prescribing ratio - 8. 5 %, p =  0. 03). Another primary outcome (prescription of risedronate) showed a reduction at 24 and 48 months (- 7. 6 %, p =  0. 02; and - 9, 8 %, p =  0. 03), but not at six months (- 5. 1 %, p =  0. 36). In the SIDRO trial both primary outcomes showed a statistically significant reduction (prescription of <b>barnidipine</b> - 9. 8 %, p =  0. 02; prescription of prulifloxacin - 11. 1 %, p =  0. 04), which persisted or increased over time. INTERPRETATION: These two cluster RCTs showed the large scale feasibility of a complex educational program in a NHS setting, and its potentially relevant long-term impact on prescribing habits, in particular when focusing on a single drug. National Health systems should invest in independent drug information programs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Controlled-Trials. com ISRCTN 05866587...|$|E
40|$|Essential {{hypertension}} is {{a complex}} clinical condition, characterized by multiple and concomitant abnormal activation of different regulatory and contra-regulatory pathophysiological mechanisms, leading to sustained increase of blood pressure (BP) levels. Asymptomatic rise of BP may, indeed, promote development and progression of hypertension-related organ damage, which in turn, {{increases the risk of}} major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. A progressive and independent relationship has been demonstrated between high BP levels and increased cardiovascular risk, even in the high-to-normal range. Conversely, evidence from randomized controlled clinical trials have independently shown that lowering BP to the recommended targets reduces individual cardiovascular risk, thus improving event-free survival and reducing the incidence of hypertension-related cardiovascular events. Despite these benefits, overall rates of BP control remain poor, worldwide. Currently available guidelines support a substantial equivalence amongst various antihypertensive drug classes. However, several studies have also reported clinically relevant differences among antihypertensive drugs, in terms of both BP lowering efficacy and tolerability/safety profile. These differences should be taken into account not only when adopting first-line antihypertensive therapy, but also when titrating or modulating combination therapies, with the aim of achieving effective and sustained BP control. This review will briefly describe evidence supporting the use of dihydropyridinic calcium channel blockers for the clinical management of hypertension, with a particular focus on <b>barnidipine.</b> Indeed, this drug has been demonstrated to be effective, safe and well tolerated in lowering BP levels and in reducing hypertension-related organ damage, thus showing a potential key role for improving the clinical management of hypertension...|$|E
