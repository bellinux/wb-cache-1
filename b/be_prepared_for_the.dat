5|$|This planned {{attack against}} Hill 518 {{coincided with the}} {{defection}} of Major Kim Song Jun of the NK 19th Regiment, NK 13th Division. He reported that a full-scale North Korean attack was to begin at dusk that day. The NK 13th Division, he said, had just taken in 4,000 replacements, 2,000 of them without weapons, and was now back to a strength of approximately 9,000 men. Upon receiving this intelligence, Gay alerted all front-line units to <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> attack.|$|E
5|$|Simultaneous {{with their}} attack at Ka-san, UN and North Korean units were {{similarly}} deadlocked {{a short distance}} away in the Battle of Tabu-dong. In that sector, NK Major Kim Song Jun of the NK 19th Regiment, NK 13th Division had defected to the UN troops on September 1. He reported that a full-scale North Korean attack was to begin at dusk that day. The NK 13th Division, he said, had just taken in 4,000 replacements, 2,000 of them without weapons, and was now back to a strength of approximately 9,000 men. Upon receiving this intelligence, 1st Cavalry Division commander Major General Hobart R. Gay alerted all of his division's front-line units to <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> attack.

5|$|When the German Operation Nordwind {{offensive}} threatened Strasbourg, Pash {{ordered all}} captured documents to be removed. Papers indicating {{the nature of}} the Alsos Mission were removed or destroyed. Although Strasbourg was not abandoned by the Allies, and ultimately did not fall, the Alsos Mission departed the city on 8 January 1945. Pash even ordered an evacuation plan to <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Alsos Mission's main headquarters in Paris. The embarrassing series of intelligence failures that had led up to the Battle of the Bulge cast doubts on the Alsos Mission's own findings. A four-man team under Eckman was sent to investigate a suspiciously devastating V-2 explosion near Antwerp, and Fred Wardenburg had to confirm {{that it was not a}} small nuclear explosion. Rumors that Germany had an atomic bomb persisted as late as March 1945.|$|E

5|$|After docking in Kiel, the {{men from}} Asar-i Tevfik were {{transferred}} to İzmir, but with no funds to buy coal, the men were stranded in Germany. Germaniawerft stripped down Asar-i Tevfik, but then halted work to await the first Ottoman payment. By mid-1901, the men had accumulated significant debt and the Ottoman government had {{made no effort to}} return them or pay the installments for the modernization program. Even Kaiser Wilhelm II became involved in an attempt to press the Ottoman government to settle the debts incurred by the sailors. Instead, the Ottomans demanded that Krupp, the owner of the Germaniawerft shipyard, make an advance of 6,000lira so that İzmir could <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> voyage back to Constantinople. The Ottomans were at the time negotiating for a large armament contract with Krupp for the Army, and used this as leverage; by late 1901, Krupp conceded, rather than risk the lucrative contract. The debts in Kiel were paid and İzmir finally departed for home.|$|E
5|$|Rane, {{in command}} of {{a section of the}} 37th Assault Field Company, {{attached}} to the 4th Dogra Battalion, was sent forward to help clear a path for the battalion. As Rane and his team started clearing a minefield, mortar fire from the Pakistanis killed two sappers and wounded five others, including Rane. Despite this, by the evening of 8 April, Rane and his surviving men cleared the minefield which enabled the supporting tanks to move forward. A safe lane still had to <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> tanks as the road ahead was still dangerous; the Pakistani forces had yet to be cleared from the area. This lane was created by Rane through the night. The next day, his section worked for twelve continuous hours to clear mines and roadblocks. As the road was still too difficult to deal with, he made a diversion for the battalion to forward. Rane continued this work despite ongoing artillery and mortar fire from the Pakistanis.|$|E
5|$|Rovers' {{losing streak}} resumed in October {{with a loss}} at league leaders Bury. Tranmere finally scored a goal, which was only their second in seven games, in the League Trophy Second Round clash against Carlisle United. The game went to a shoot-out, won by Rovers 5–4 after Patrick Brough missed the sixth shot for the guests. On 11 October, after fourth {{consecutive}} league defeat at Plymouth Argyle, Tranmere Rovers reached {{the bottom of the}} League Two table with only nine points in 12 games. Two days later manager Rob Edwards had been sacked. On 16 November, ex-Port Vale manager Micky Adams was announced as his replacement, though the team was to <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next game by the assistant managers. Adams took charge after a fifth straight league defeat and announced the return to the club of Chris Shuker as assistant manager while Alex Russell left the club. Also, a double loan signing was made in order to strengthen the attack line: Armand Gnanduillet joined from Chesterfield and Danny Johnson signed from Cardiff City, while midfielder Steve Jennings, who was signed by Adams for Port Vale last summer, rejoined him at Tranmere on loan until January.|$|E

25|$|Many {{philosophers}} {{who initially}} read Kierkegaard, especially Kierkegaard's (written under the pseudonym of Johannes de Silentio) Fear and Trembling, often {{come to the}} conclusion that Kierkegaard supports a divine command law of ethics. The divine command theory is a metaethical theory which claims moral values are whatever is commanded by a god or gods. However, Kierkegaard is not arguing that morality is created by God; instead, he would argue that a divine command from God transcends ethics. This distinction means that God does not necessarily create human morality: it is up to us as individuals to create our own morals and values. But any religious person must <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> event of a divine command from God that would take precedence over all moral and rational obligations. Kierkegaard called this event the teleological suspension of the ethical. Abraham, the knight of faith, chose to obey God unconditionally, and was rewarded with his son, his faith, and the title of Father of Faith. Abraham transcended ethics and leaped into faith.|$|E
