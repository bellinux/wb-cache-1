40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides an}} up-to-date {{introduction to the}} Certamen Homeri et Hesiodi, a critical edition of the text, and the first commentary in English on it. The Certamen is an anonymous work composed around the second century AD. It gives {{an account of the}} lives of Homer and Hesiod and of their poetic contest by re-elaborating biographical anecdotes attested from the sixth century BC onwards. As a biographical work that draws on older texts and oral traditions which developed over hundreds of years, it yields unique insights into the reception of early Greek Epic in the course of classical antiquity. This thesis begins with an introduction to the tradition of the contest between Homer and Hesiod that collects and discusses the extant ancient accounts of that story. It argues that all versions <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> <b>authoritative</b> in principle, for they testify to different acts of reception of the poets in different contexts. The thesis then offers an up-to-date analysis of the manuscript witnesses of the Certamen and of their contribution {{to our understanding of the}} textual tradition of this text, and shows that the ancient biographies of the poets form a corpus that is naturally open to variation. The Edition provides a text that accounts for such an open tradition. The line-by-line Commentary offers a systematic analysis of both general and specific issues related to the text: this is a necessary and urgent task, not least because the Certamen is a stratified text, bringing together traditions of very different provenance, which can only be assessed and interpreted through a process of close reading. The ultimate aim of the thesis is to show how the story of the contest between Homer and Hesiod provides crucial insights into the processes of reception and canonisation of early hexameter epic from the archaic period to late antiquity...|$|R

40|$|Latin orthography {{among the}} Humanists {{was not that}} of the {{classical}} era. From this point of view, greater or smaller divergences can be seen, mainly of medieval origin, which vary from writer to writer, work to work, and which are not uncommon within {{the work of the}} same writer. This is mainly to do with a different or uneven or inconsistent way of recording many of the phonemes (e. g., cƒlum instead of caelum, sydera for sidera, nuncius for nuntius, solatium for solacium, bellua not belua, palium not pallium, and of doublets like aeger and eger, heres and haeres, martyr and martir, Holophernes and Olophernes, blasphemia and blasfemans, satiare and saciare and triplets like femina, faemina and foemina, Africa, Affrica and Aphrica, and so on). It is necessary to know these particular features because the quality of the editorial work of recent editions, which will be judged by the rigorous criteria of contemporary textual scholarship, largely depends on them. For this delicate work to be done the way it should, it is very useful to have the autographs, particularly of a given work that we wish to publish in a contemporary edition. To do with Marulić, we are in a better situation than we are in the case of many other Latin authors in Croatia, because we do actually possess autographs of many of his works. Thus to a large extent we have the relevant facts that adequately, although not everywhere completely, illustrate his habitual practice with respect to orthography. It should nevertheless be stated that not all Marulić’s autographs <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> <b>authoritative</b> for this work. Thus the autograph of his most extensive work, Repertorium, which consists of excerpts from a large number of heterogeneous sources, shows so many differences in grammar and spelling that it is justified to take them as being a reflection of the differences in his authors, rather than of Marulić’s own unevenness or inconsistence. Only in this way is it possible to explain the difference {{in the name of the}} prophet Isaiah -Isaias and Esaias, or the six-fold variation in the name of Abel’s brother: Cayn, Chayn, Chain, Cainus, Caym and Caim. However, from an analysis of the entire number of Marulić’s autographs it can be concluded that his orthography is only moderately uneven, and that the writer did actually aim at a certain unity of usage — even at the price of a certain lack of intelligibility (for example, he used M. as an abbreviation for both Marcus and Manius). It can also be stated that he is from this point of view in his approach nevertheless closer to today’s rules of spelling and grammar than most of his contemporaries (in, for example, the matter of writing upper or lower case letters) ...|$|R
5000|$|In Canada since 1891 the [...] "equal {{authenticity}} rule" [...] {{has held}} that the French and English versions of all federal laws <b>are</b> considered <b>equally</b> <b>authoritative.</b> Nevertheless, the English and French texts of important may not translate exactly, which leaves {{open the possibility that}} justices may understand the same law to mean two different things. This includes the problem of [...] "law" [...] versus [...] "droit". For example, Osgoode Hall scholar Robert Leckey argues that in the 2006 Multani case over the banning of kirpans (Sikh ceremonial daggers) by a school board in Quebec, the justices of the Supreme Court of Canada, despite all writing their reasons in French, disagreed over the meaning of the phrase [...] "ne peuvent être restreints que par une règle de droit" [...] in Section 1 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which appears in the English version of the text as [...] "not prescribed by law".

Lackey asserts that [...] "in administrative law from France, and in administrative law scholarship written in French in Quebec, a regulation is 'une règle de droit' and a decision is not 'une règle de droit'" [...] whereas in English-language scholarship the difference between [...] "prescribed by law" [...] and not [...] "prescribed by law" [...] {{has nothing to do with}} a distinction between general norms and individual decisions.|$|R

Emphasis on precise or probable simultaneity between intuitive knowing and a distant crisis, such as death or illness—whether such emphasis is literal or rhetorical in any given version—is a primary, and philosophically important, characteristic of these narratives. This characteristic distinguishes them, in many cases, from stories of prophecy and premonition. Whereas precognition accounts may portray tragedies which arrive some time more clearly after the moment of their anticipation—a day, a week, or a year later, perhaps—ESENs portray correspondences which approach precise simultaneity, separated at most by mere seconds, minutes, or hours within a day—if by any time at all. While premonition stories often describe human crises envisioned before they come to pass, ESENs emphasize the wonder of synchronicity, between crises and their intuitions elsewhere. As such, ESENs sustain a number oi fundamentally different philosophical explanations and beliefs about causality than do precognition stories. Unlike a premonition, an intuition of a distant simultaneous tragedy cannot be explained by folklorists' concept of foreknowledge or what a philosopher might regard, more skeptically, as “backward causation, for {{it is not the}} future which appears, so impossibly, to be known. Neither can the fleeting vision of a person dying at that very moment in a distant place be attributed confidently to the agency of any ghost—in time, a death has not yet occurred: the beliefs the stories inspire must conform to the stories' temporality. [...] Distinguishing between such story types on the basis of temporality (along with other general thematic features) allows hybrid versions—for example, a story about an ongoing feeling of nameless fear weeks prior to an unexpected death, culminating in a extraordinary simultaneous dream or vision—to be understood and discussed more clearly in terms of philosophical arguments and folk beliefs about causality. This kind of distinction also adds kindling to the interpretive debate surrounding all stories of extraordinary or supernatural experience, a debate in which scholars and storytellers <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> <b>authoritative</b> participants, {{on the subject of the}} stories' meanings and possible causes. [...] While I have found only one passage in the New Testament which matches the ESEN pattern, many New Testament passages demonstrate that beliefs about the holiness of coincidence existed in early Christianity. Narratives of holy simultaneities are more plentiful in medieval collections of exempla and legend, but these texts carry on the conventions of hour notation and envisioning death and suffering as a moment, conventions which are established in the New Testament. The persistence of these narratives in increasingly secularized contexts for centuries afterward, up to and including 20 th-century academic literature and informal North American oral narration, may be explained by the fact that the stories manage to sustain many different interpretations, sacred and secular—psychological and biological ones, alongside the religious and the supernatural.
