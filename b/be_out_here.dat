It’s something that I did with her voice. I mean, a lot or people who hear it, they might not even realize that it's her. I use textures when I do records and I just wanted her voice texture on this record, and she really made this song. Now she's been complaining saying she's been taken off the record, I don't know where that came from. She's really foolish to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> talking [...] I'm still gonna keep her on the song because she ain't {{know what she was}} doing".|$|E

2500|$|White {{told the}} Roanoke Times {{that he is}} not a racist or Nazi, {{describing}} himself as a [...] "libertarian socialist." [...] He admitted to being an antisemite: [...] "I wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> buying and fixing up houses if I had some agenda against the black community...The Jews, I despise. They hate me. I hate them." [...] He acknowledged calling some Roanoke residents [...] "local nig-rats" [...] and accused them of [...] "conspiring to test me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Only if I had <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> long. I {{said we had}} <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> a good bit, and {{had been}} hauling goods to the camps where we had been. I did not give any time, {{but it was a}} long list of camps, and they must have {{reckoned}} we had <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> some months. One of them said something about a reference, so as to be sure that I should bring the goods here when I got them, but I said--Reference be blowed. We had <b>been</b> hauling <b>out</b> <b>here</b> long enough, and as we had got a waggon and team it weren't likely we were going to risk them and being shot {{for the sake of a}} few pounds' worth of goods: so they did not say anything more about it. I said my mate was going to work here and was going to buy a claim, and that satisfied them a bit. I suppose you are going to have your grub here at one o'clock?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, what do {{you know}} about this?" [...] he exclaimed, turning to his companions. [...] "Those four young Rovers <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> right by the window!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{is it you}} <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> still? This <b>is</b> Thursday, isn't it? We {{meant to}} have been half way home, to be {{in time for the}} matches." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Kells, I'm much obliged," [...] replied Cleve, with {{a semblance}} of earnestness. [...] "I'm no good or I wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>here...</b> But I can't stand for these--these deals with girls." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know; of course, {{the lines}} can be run again by any one; {{but there must}} be a scheme in it, for Mr. Wright wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> unless {{something}} could be gained by it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have come}} for Maxon," [...] growled the creature. [...] "We have been penned up long enough. We want to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>here.</b> We {{have come to}} kill Maxon and you and all who have made us what we are." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "She met you, at the Fergusons', {{just for}} a moment, when she <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> last autumn. What really nice and simple people the Fergusons are, with all their money!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are awfully good," [...] said Cicely, [...] "but {{you must}} {{agree with me}} more prudently now that we <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> and I will not tell mother until Miriam knows." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sartain--Pete, Masser Ten Eyck's man, was {{put into}} a hole, near Masser Corny's hut, which must <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> four or five miles off; while masser {{surveyor}} and his men were buried by a spring, somewhere off yonder. Am I right, Injin?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no!" [...] {{interrupted}} Elsie. [...] "We must camp. Don't {{think of}} putting us under a roof." [...] A little later she said, {{in a low}} voice: [...] "Father is in Chicago, and expects to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> later. I mean, he's coming to make {{a tour of the}} State." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I tried it, but {{it needs}} a damp place, and our cold nights kill it. No, it won't grow in our old house; but I cover it with leaves, and the little green sprouts come up as hearty as can <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>here.</b> The shade, the spring, {{the shelter of the}} rock, keep it alive, you see, so it's no use trying to move it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You've {{struck the}} nail on the head, lad. And why not, seeing as how we <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> in {{fighting}} waters, and with no ship of our own to go aboard?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd {{made up my}} {{mind that}} 'most {{everybody}} knew I <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> on your case," [...] the amateur detective said, as if speaking to himself, and Plums asked, in surprise: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is my brother-in-law. He has <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> {{now nearly}} two years, and has seen {{enough of the}} doings of the murderers at Nantes to hate {{them as much as}} I do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense, Corny. Who hesitates about {{stopping}} at a gentleman's door, {{when he is}} travelling? Herman Mordaunt would have given us a hearty welcome, and I should {{have gone on to}} Lilacsbush, did I not know that the family is certain to be in town at this season. Easter came early this year, and to-morrow will be {{the first day of the}} Pinkster holidays. As soon as they are over, Herman Mordaunt and Anneke will <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> to enjoy their lilacs and roses." ...|$|E
6000|$|Claire was {{whispering}} to Milt, [...] "If {{we can get}} rid of your dreadful passenger, I do want you to meet Mr. Saxton. He may be of use to you some day. He's terribly capable, and really quite nice. Think! He happened to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> and he traced me by telephone--oh, he treats long-distance 'phoning as I do a hair-pin. He brought down the duckiest presents--divertissements for dinner, and that knitted robe, and some real René Bleuzet perfume--I was all out of it---- And after the grime of the road----" ...|$|E
6000|$|Cuthbert {{accepted}} the invitation willingly. [...] "Yes, {{you can come}} down with us, Mary," [...] he went on, in answer to a look of appeal from her. [...] "I will bring her back safely, Madame Michaud, the sight will be well worth seeing. Before I go I will have a look round and see if I can get a bed for the night, {{it is a long}} way out from my lodgings and I should like to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> by daylight, for if they mean to march on Versailles they are sure to start as soon as it is light." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{knew them}} all once," [...] Edgar said. [...] "We were at school together. I {{did not know}} that any of them <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>here.</b> I would not have them {{recognize}} me for anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now we {{had better}} come to an understanding," [...] said Dan Baxter, as he warmed his hands. [...] "We all know what we <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> for, {{so there is no}} use in mincing matters." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Three eggs," [...] said he. [...] "I think Dorothy has not <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> to-day. That <b>is</b> the {{beginning}} of your profits. You can take two of them; {{we have to leave}} one for the nest-egg." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The old chap,' he thought, 'is touched. He evidently oughtn't to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> by himself.' He debated, therefore, {{whether he}} should hasten away toward his car, or stand by in case his {{assistance}} should be needed. Being a kind-hearted man, who believed in his capacity for putting things to rights, and noticing a certain delicacy--a [...] "sort of something rather distinguished," [...] as he phrased it afterwards--in the old fellow's face and figure, he decided {{to see if he}} could be of any service. They walked along together, Mr. Purcey watching his new friend askance, and directing the march to where he had ordered his chauffeur to await him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you know, I shouldn't {{wonder if}} you were right; and it's a pity, too, for we shall have to live a good deal on such fare, I believe. However, I suppose we shall get used to it.--But I say, boys, isn't it jolly to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> living like savages? I declare {{it seems to me}} like a dream or a romance.--Just look, Ralph, at the strange wild creepers that are festooned overhead, and the great {{tropical}} leaves behind us, and the clear sky above, with the moon--ah! the moon; yes, that's one comfort--the moon is unchanged. The same moon that smiles down upon us through a tangled mesh-work of palm-leaves and wild vines and monkeys' tails, is peeping down the chimney-pots of London and Edinburgh and Dublin!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They will be {{some time}} before they make {{out what it is}} all about, Peters," [...] Captain Martin said. [...] "The galleys will be manned, and will row to the spot where the firing was heard. Some {{of the men in the}} boat are sure to be able to swim, and will meet them as they come out and tell them what has happened. The worst of it is, the moon will be up in a few minutes. I forgot all about that. That {{accounts}} for its being lighter. However, we have got a good start. One or two guard boats may <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> in a quarter of an hour, but it will take the galleys twice as long to gather their crews and get out. It all depends on the wind. It is lucky it is not light yet, or the batteries might open on us; I don't think now they will get sight of us until we are fairly out of range." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't seem {{to place}} it somehow," [...] said Prescott in alarm, seeing {{that if he were}} called upon to share any more reminiscences it might lead him into difficulties. [...] "You know I've <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> a while." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{sometimes}} {{feel as though}} it were," [...] he answered. [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> this morning, when the wind was at play," [...] and he pointed with his whip at a fantastic snowdrift, [...] "before I saw you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said (his {{invariably}} preliminary jocosity {{at every}} call I made), [...] "I suppose you <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> making kodak {{pictures of the}} mountains. It's the wrong {{time of the year}} to buy any hardware, of course." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know you}} don't get killed if you don't think you will. Now I never thought I should get killed. And I never knew a man get killed if he hadn't been {{thinking}} he would. I said to Wallace I'd rather <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> at the front, than at Chelsea. I hated Chelsea--I can't {{tell you how}} much. 'Oh no, sir!' he said. 'I'd rather be at Chelsea than here. I'd rather be at Chelsea. There isn't hell like this at Chelsea.' We'd had orders that we were {{to go back to}} the real camp the next day. 'Never mind, Wallace,' I said. 'We shall be out of this hell-on-earth tomorrow.' And he took my hand. We weren't much for showing feeling or anything in the guards. But he took my hand. And we climbed out to charge--Poor fellow, he was killed--" [...] Herbertson dropped his head, and for some moments seemed to go unconscious, as if struck. Then he lifted his face, and went on in the same animated chatty fashion: [...] "You see, he had a presentiment. I'm sure he had a presentiment. None of the men got killed unless they had a presentiment--like that, you know...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "According to {{your point}} of view, {{there is no doubt}} about it, Childee; but then there is equally no doubt the other way, {{according}} to the statements they put forward. But that is generally the way in all these land disputes. For good hard swearing your Hindoo cultivator can be matched against the world. Unfortunately there is nothing either in your grant or in your neighbors' that specifies unmistakably which of these ancient ditches is the one referred to. My present impression is that it is essentially a case for a compromise, but you know the final decision does not rest on me. I shall <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> again next week, and I shall write to the Talookdar to meet me here, and we will go over the ground together again, and see if we cannot arrange some line that will be fair to both parties. If we can do that, the matter would be settled without expense and trouble; whereas, if it goes up to Lucknow it may all have to be gone into again; and if the decision is given against you, and as far as I can see it is just as likely to be one way as another, it will be a serious thing for the village." ...|$|E
6000|$|Understand {{clearly that}} all racing is rotten--as {{everything}} connected with losing money must <b>be.</b> <b>Out</b> <b>here,</b> {{in addition to}} its inherent rottenness, it has the merit of being two-thirds sham; looking pretty on paper only. Every one knows every one else far too well for business purposes. How on earth can you rack and harry and post a man for his losings, when you are fond of his wife, and live in the same Station with him? He says, [...] "on the Monday following," [...] "I can't settle just yet." [...] "You say, [...] "All right, old man," [...] and think your self lucky if you pull off nine hundred out of a two-thousand rupee debt. Any way you look at it, Indian racing is immoral, and expensively immoral. Which is much worse. If a man wants your money, he ought to ask for it, or send round a subscription-list, instead of juggling about the country, with an Australian larrikin; a [...] "brumby," [...] with as much breed as the boy; a brace of chumars in gold-laced caps; three or four ekka-ponies with hogged manes, and a switch- tailed demirep of a mare called Arab because she has a kink in her flag. Racing leads to the shroff quicker than anything else. But if you have no conscience and no sentiments, and good hands, and some knowledge of pace, and ten years' experience of horses, and several thousand rupees a month, I believe that you can occasionally contrive to pay your shoeing- bills.|$|E
