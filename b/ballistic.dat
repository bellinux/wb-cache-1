5|$|The Commission to Assess the <b>Ballistic</b> Missile Threat to the United States, {{also called}} the Rumsfeld Commission, was an {{independent}} commission formed by the US Congress to evaluate the <b>ballistic</b> missile threat posed to the United States.|$|E
5|$|The TsKB-17 design bureau {{proposed}} {{variants of}} the design with both cruise and <b>ballistic</b> missiles. The <b>ballistic</b> missiles would have been launched from vertical tubes replacing the forward turrets, and in one version, the entire main armament. The proposal was dropped because both types would have needed a fully stabilized launching platform to give them any chance of hitting their targets and that the <b>ballistic</b> missiles would need three hours of preparation time.|$|E
5|$|The ZBGM-75 Advanced Intercontinental <b>Ballistic</b> Missile, {{also known}} as Weapons System 120A (WS-120A), was a program to develop an {{intercontinental}} <b>ballistic</b> missile (ICBM), proposed by the United States Air Force in the 1960s {{as a replacement for}} the LGM-30 Minuteman as the Air Force's standard ICBM. Funding was not allocated for the program and the project was cancelled in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} World War II Germany {{introduced}} the V-1 cruise missile and V-2 <b>ballistic</b> missiles in combat against the Allied forces. The missiles arrived too late to alter {{the course of the}} war, but after the fall of Nazi Germany the V-1 and V-2 rockets would form the foundations for the space race and for the policy of Mutually Assured Destruction by providing each superpower with <b>Ballistic</b> Missiles and Submarine Launched <b>Ballistic</b> Missiles that could carry nuclear warheads.|$|E
5|$|As of 2012 the Green Pine radar has {{a proven}} track record {{demonstrated}} in over 20 successful <b>ballistic</b> missile intercepts.|$|E

5|$|In 1953, the US Secretary of Defense, Charles E. Wilson, {{raised the}} {{possibility}} of a joint <b>ballistic</b> missile programme with the Minister of Supply, Duncan Sandys. This resulted in an agreement on collaboration being signed on 12 August 1954, and a British Medium Range <b>Ballistic</b> Missile (MRBM) development project codenamed Blue Streak. The United States pursued Intermediate Range <b>Ballistic</b> Missile (IRBM) development in parallel. Indeed, it had two IRBM projects: the US Army's Jupiter and the USAF's Thor. When Sandys, now the Minister of Defence, visited the United States in January 1957, he found the Americans anxious to deploy IRBMs in Britain. Macmillan and Eisenhower agreed to do so during their summit in Bermuda in March 1957, and a formal agreement was drawn up on 17 December 1957, although {{it was not until the}} end of the month that it was definitely determined that Britain would receive Thor and not Jupiter missiles. The deployment was codenamed Project Emily.|$|E
5|$|In testing {{conducted}} by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in 1999, the SS190 fired from the P90 {{at a distance of}} 25m (27yd) exhibited an average penetration depth of 25cm (9.85in) in <b>ballistic</b> gelatin covered with a Level II vest. The SS190 exhibited penetration depths ranging from 28 to 34cm (11 to 13.5in) when fired from the P90 into bare <b>ballistic</b> gelatin, in tests {{conducted by}} Houston Police Department SWAT. In testing, the SS190 and similar 5.7×28mm projectiles consistently turn base over point ("tumble") as they pass through <b>ballistic</b> gelatin and other media, using the 21.6-mm (.85in) projectile length to create a larger wound cavity. However, some are skeptical of the bullet's terminal performance, and it is a subject of debate among civilian shooters in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Space Race began, an early {{objective}} was to get a person into Earth orbit as soon as possible, therefore the simplest spacecraft that could be launched by existing rockets was favored. The US Air Force's Man in Space Soonest program considered many manned spacecraft designs, ranging from rocket planes like the X-15, to small <b>ballistic</b> space capsules. By 1958, the space plane concepts were eliminated {{in favor of the}} <b>ballistic</b> capsule.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ballistic</b> {{annihilation}} {{describes a}} {{process by which}} moving particles and antiparticles annihilate each other when they collide. In the simplest version of this process, the system consists of a single type of particle and antiparticle, moving at equal speeds in opposite directions in a one-dimensional medium.|$|E
5|$|Bond is {{tasked with}} {{investigating}} {{the disappearance of}} British and Soviet <b>ballistic</b> missile submarines and the subsequent offer to sell a submarine tracking system. Bond works alongside Major Anya Amasova of the KGB. The pair track the plans across Egypt and identify {{the person responsible for}} the thefts as shipping tycoon, scientist and anarchist Karl Stromberg.|$|E
5|$|Deurne {{airfield}} was to {{be destroyed}} by Jagdgeschwader 77 (JG 77). Antwerp housed the largest Allied contingent of nine Squadrons. It had been incessantly attacked by V-1 cruise missiles and V-2 SRBM <b>ballistic</b> missiles, and {{had been given a}} strong anti-aircraft defence.|$|E
5|$|Having {{brought in}} the project on time and on budget, Shea {{established}} a reputation in the aerospace community. In 1961 he was offered and accepted a position with Space Technology Laboratories, a division of TRW Inc., where he continued to work on <b>ballistic</b> missile systems.|$|E
5|$|Judge Appleby {{eventually}} cut off {{funds for}} any further expert defense testimony. Shakur, in her autobiography, and Williams, in Inadmissible Evidence, both {{claim that it}} was difficult to find expert witnesses for the trial, because of the expense and because most forensic and <b>ballistic</b> specialists declined on the grounds of a conflict of interest when approached because they routinely performed such work for law enforcement officials.|$|E
5|$|Project Emily was the {{deployment}} of American-built Thor intermediate-range <b>ballistic</b> missiles in the United Kingdom between 1959 and 1963. Royal Air Force (RAF) Bomber Command operated 60 Thor missiles, dispersed to 20 RAF air stations, {{as part of the}} UK nuclear deterrent.|$|E
5|$|Rule 184 can be {{understood}} in terms of <b>ballistic</b> annihilation, a system of particles moving both leftwards and rightwards through a one-dimensional medium. When two such particles collide, they annihilate each other, so that at each step the number of particles remains unchanged or decreases.|$|E
5|$|STRAT-X, or Strategic-Experimental, was a U.S. government-sponsored study {{conducted}} during 1966 and 1967 that comprehensively analyzed the potential {{future of the}} U.S. nuclear deterrent force. At the time, the Soviet Union was making significant strides in nuclear weapons delivery, and also constructing anti-ballistic missile defenses to protect strategic facilities. To address a potential technological {{gap between the two}} superpowers, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara entrusted the classified STRAT-X study to the Institute for Defense Analyses, which compiled a twenty-volume report in nine months. The report looked into more than one hundred different weapons systems, ultimately resulting in the MGM-134 Midgetman and LGM-118 Peacekeeper intercontinental <b>ballistic</b> missiles, the s, and the Trident submarine-launched <b>ballistic</b> missiles, among others. Journalists have regarded STRAT-X as a major influence on the course of U.S. nuclear policy.|$|E
5|$|The High Virgo, {{also known}} as Weapons System 199C (WS-199C), was a {{prototype}} air-launched <b>ballistic</b> missile (ALBM) jointly developed by Lockheed and the Convair division of General Dynamics during the late 1950s. The missile proved moderately successful and aided {{in the development of}} the later GAM-87 Skybolt ALBM. It was also used in early tests of anti-satellite weapons.|$|E
5|$|The Ohio {{class was}} {{designed}} in the 1970s to carry the concurrently-designed Trident submarine-launched <b>ballistic</b> missile. Both variants of the Tridents—the UGM-96 Trident I and the UGM-133 Trident II—are propelled by three-stage solid propellant rockets and are equipped with 8–14 nuclear warheads. The 73,000lb (33,100kg) UGM-96, {{with a range of}} 4,000mi (6,400km), served from October 1979, starting with the Benjamin Franklin-class USS Francis Scott Key, until 2006. The 130,000lb (59,000kg) UGM-133, with a range of 6,000mi (9,700km), is in service , having been introduced in 1990 with USS Tennessee. The primary self-defense weapon of the class is the Mk 48 ADCAP torpedo. Ohio-class submarines that carry <b>ballistic</b> missiles receive orders from the United States Strategic Command based in Nebraska.|$|E
5|$|The {{behavior}} of certain other systems, such as one-dimensional cyclic cellular automata, {{can also be}} {{described in terms of}} <b>ballistic</b> annihilation. There is a technical restriction on the particle positions for the <b>ballistic</b> annihilation view of Rule 184 that does not arise in these other systems, stemming from the alternating pattern of the background: in the particle system corresponding to a Rule 184 state, if two consecutive particles are both of the same type they must be an odd number of cells apart, while if they are of opposite types they must be an even number of cells apart. However this parity restriction does not {{play a role in the}} statistical {{behavior of}} this system.|$|E
5|$|The major {{development}} of {{weapons in the}} early modern and modern periods occurred with firearms, which became progressively more efficient. Gunpowder settled into its standard ratio in the 17th century, and general <b>ballistic</b> technology improved. Initially, iron round shot replaced the earlier stone balls for cannon then, latterly, different types of shot were invented.|$|E
5|$|With the {{background}} of a buildup in tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States, and the deployment of Soviet RSD-10 Pioneer <b>ballistic</b> missiles targeting Western Europe, NATO decided, under the impetus of the Carter presidency, to deploy MGM-31 Pershing and cruise missiles in Europe, primarily West Germany. This deployment would have placed missiles just 10minutes' striking distance from Moscow.|$|E
5|$|According to FN, the 5.7×28mm {{cartridge}} has {{an effective}} range of 200m (219yd) {{and a maximum}} range of 1,800m (1,969yd) when fired from the P90, and an effective range of 50m (55yd) and a maximum range of 1,510m (1,651yd) when fired from the Five-seven. In testing, the SS190 and similar 5.7×28mm projectiles consistently turn base over point ("tumble") as they pass through <b>ballistic</b> gelatin and other media, using the 21.6-mm (.85in) projectile length to create a larger wound cavity. However, some are skeptical of the bullet's terminal performance, {{and it is a}} subject of debate among civilian shooters in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Allegations of {{research}} misconduct or improprieties have received substantial press coverage. Professor David Baltimore, a Nobel Laureate, became {{embroiled in a}} misconduct investigation starting in 1986 that led to Congressional hearings in 1991. Professor Ted Postol has accused the MIT administration since 2000 of attempting to whitewash potential research misconduct at the Lincoln Lab facility involving a <b>ballistic</b> missile defense test, though a final investigation into the matter has not been completed. Associate Professor Luk Van Parijs was dismissed in 2005 following allegations of scientific misconduct and found guilty of the same by the United States Office of Research Integrity in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Although {{of little}} {{strategic}} value and undamaged {{during the early}} stages of World War II, {{in the final stages of}} the war a number of V-1 flying bombs and V-2 <b>ballistic</b> missiles struck the area. The worst attack occurred in February 1945, when a V-2 struck Westbeech Road, killing 17 and injuring 68. The bombsites were redeveloped with housing in then-current styles, rather than to Plumbe and Earle's designs.|$|E
5|$|Although {{previous}} Congress governments {{developed the}} capability {{for a nuclear}} weapons test, the Vajpayee government broke with India's historical strategy of avoiding it and authorised Pokhran-II, a series of five nuclear tests in 1998. The tests came soon after Pakistan tested a medium-range <b>ballistic</b> missile. They were seen {{as an attempt to}} display India's military prowess to the world, and a reflection of anti-Pakistan sentiment within the BJP.|$|E
5|$|An {{operation}} is {{launched by the}} task force {{to take back the}} site from Zakhaev’s forces via halo jump. However, Zakhaev promptly launches nuclear intercontinental <b>ballistic</b> missiles at the U.S. Eastern Seaboard, with the potential of causing 41 million casualties. The SAS and Force Recon, however, manage to breach the facility, seize the command room and remotely destroy the missiles over the Atlantic Ocean. They escape in military trucks with Zakhaev's forces in hot pursuit.|$|E
5|$|Another {{conversion}} {{project in}} early 1956 {{called for the}} installation of two Polaris nuclear <b>ballistic</b> missile launchers with a capacity for sixteen weapons. Also proposed were four RIM-8 Talos SAM launchers with eighty missiles per launcher and twelve RIM-24 Tartar SAM launchers with 504 missiles. A July 1956 estimate projected completing the ship by July 1961, {{but the cost of}} the conversion ultimately forced the Navy to abandon the project.|$|E
5|$|Bullets and casings {{found at}} a scene require a known example to compare {{to in order to}} match them to a weapon. Without a weapon, the {{striation}} pattern can be uploaded to a database such as the National Integrated <b>Ballistic</b> Identification Network (NIBIN) maintained by the ATF or the United Kingdom's National Ballistics Intelligence Service (NABIS). Information uploaded to these databases can be used to track gun crimes and to link crimes together. Maintainers of these databases recommend that every recovered firearm be test fired and the resulting known exemplar be uploaded into the database.|$|E
5|$|Defense systems play {{a smaller}} {{role in the}} industry. Ohio {{corporations}} were awarded around $5.5 billion of United States Department of Defense procurements. Notable defense contractors include Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company in Akron, Lockheed Martin in Akron, which won a contract to develop a space-ship in 2003 and produces the vertical launch ASROC missile, and Armor Holdings Aerospace and Defense Group in Fairfield. United Kingdom-based BAE Systems has a large facility in West Chester producing armored vehicles, armor kits, and <b>ballistic</b> glass.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, five Merlin Mk3s were {{operating}} in Afghanistan, transporting troops and supplies. The deployment to Afghanistan was criticised as the aircraft reportedly lacked protective Kevlar armour. By July 2010, the Merlin fleet was fully fitted with <b>ballistic</b> armour. The deployment of Merlins to Afghanistan allowed the detachment of Sea Kings {{to be withdrawn}} from the region in October 2011. As part of the UK drawdown in Afghanistan, Merlins were withdrawn from theatre in June 2013.|$|E
5|$|In April 1958, Eisenhower asked Congress for {{legislation}} {{to overhaul the}} Department of Defense. Over a decade had passed since the legislation which had established it, and {{he was concerned about}} the degree of inter-service rivalry, duplication and mismanagement that was evident in many programs. In <b>ballistic</b> missile development, the Soviet Sputnik program had demonstrated that country's technological lead over the United States. The Army and Air Force had rival programs, PGM-19 Jupiter and PGM-17 Thor respectively, and the additional cost to the taxpayers of developing two systems instead of one was estimated at $500million.|$|E
5|$|In early 1950, Saville {{served on}} the Guided Missiles Interdepartmental Operational Requirements Group (GMIORG), a {{military}} and civilian committee tasked with the coordination of research on guided missiles, {{as well as the}} development of tactics and overall strategy. In his role as USAF Deputy Chief of Staff for Development, Saville helped direct missile work, but soon replaced himself on the GMIORG with Major General Robert M. Lee, commander of TAC. Saville was more interested in air-to-air guided missiles than in ground-based <b>ballistic</b> missiles, which became the focus of the committee.|$|E
5|$|In {{his book}} A New Kind of Science, Stephen Wolfram {{points out that}} rule 184, when run on {{patterns}} with density 50%, {{can be interpreted as}} parsing the context free language describing strings formed from nested parentheses. This interpretation is closely related to the <b>ballistic</b> annihilation view of rule 184: in Wolfram's interpretation, an open parenthesis corresponds to a left-moving particle while a close parenthesis corresponds to a right-moving particle.|$|E
