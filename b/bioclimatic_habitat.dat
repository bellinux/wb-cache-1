40|$|The {{results of}} a multivariate morphometric study of leaf {{anatomical}} characters in different, geographically distant populations of the taxon Cephalaria laevigata from Serbia and Romania are presented with the aim to reveal the trends of population differentiation. Analyses were performed on a cross-section of 105 leaves collected from 10 populations. In order to establish the overall morphological variation and relationships between individuals from all populations, principal component analyses and canonical discriminant analysis were performed. Clustering analyses were carried out to explore whether the observed anatomical differences {{are a result of}} adaptive responses. Regression analysis was performed to identify the level of correlation between leaf anatomical characters and basic orographic, geological and <b>bioclimatic</b> <b>habitat</b> characteristics. Unexpectedly, in most of the characters there was discrepancy between leaf anatomy and climatic conditions, and the characters did not show significant regularities in the variability of their dimension neither in the vertical profile nor in relation to geological substrate.

40|$|Niche {{conservatism}} is {{the tendency}} of related species to retain ancestral tolerances after geographic separation. We used Ecological Niche Modelling and Principal Components Analysis of <b>bioclimatic</b> and <b>habitat</b> variables to describe {{the extent of the}} species niche, and degrees of bioclimatic–habitat niche conservatism within the mountain hare (L. timidus) clade. Mountain hare niche space was contrasted with that of the European hare (L. europaeus), to shed light on species interactions in contact zones throughout Europe. All five subspecies of mountain hare had quantifiably distinct niches. Fennoscandian (L. t. sylvaticus, L. t. timidus) and highland (L. t. scoticus, L. t. varronis) subspecies, however, were most similar, exhibiting greatest apparent niche conservatism. They inhabit tundra, boreal forest and uplands, and, hence are presumed most similar to the ancestral form. The Irish hare was distinct, being consistently distinguished from other mountain hares in both 2 D and nth dimensional (4 D) niche space. The ecological distinctiveness of the Irish hare provides further evidence that it is an Evolutionarily Significant Unit, particularly vulnerable to displacement by introduced European hares with which it competes and hybridises. Projections under global climate change suggest that, by 2070, bioclimatic space for invasive European hares in Ireland will expand (by 79 %) but contract for endemic Irish hares (by 75 %), further facilitating their replacement. The near complete species replacement of the heath hare (L. t. sylvaticus) in southern Sweden, where the European hare has also been introduced, may suggest a similar fate may be in store for the Irish hare...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} basic {{elements}} of ecology and conservation biology is knowing what species occur in what places. As conceptually simple as this may sound, it is an incredibly difficult and complex undertaking, although probably the single most important fact underpinning all of ecology. It is impossible to make informed decisions about conservation management without some knowledge on the general geographic distributions of species. The aim of this report is to provide readers with my best estimate of the distribution of as many species of rainforest vertebrates as possible at this time within the Wet Tropics bioregion. Understanding biodiversity necessitates understanding the factors that determine the distribution of each constituent species. Approximately 350 species of vertebrates occur in the rainforests of the Wet Tropics bioregion, however, only about 153 species have their core distributions in the rainforest. In this report, I present distribution maps for the 177 species of Wet Tropics vertebrates where there was sufficient data to produce a useful map (the vast majority of true rainforest species), and twelve species richness maps based on overlaid distribution maps (Appendix B). The distribution maps represent a combination of <b>bioclimatic</b> modeling, <b>habitat</b> preferences, biogeographic distributions and expert knowledge. Also included is a comprehensive species list of all vertebrates in the Wet Tropics bioregion (Appendix A), with information on the conservation status, range size (of the mapped species), habitat specialisation and summaries of species richness by taxa both in spatially continuous maps and in tabulated form. The CD-ROM enclosed in the back cover (Appendix C) provides a PDF version of this report, which is embedded with hyperlinks to enable easy viewing of any species maps from the Index to Maps and those mapped species listed in Appendix A...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Agricultural {{crops and}} their wild {{progenitors}} are excellent candidates for ecophysiologal research because germplasmcollections are often extensive andwell described, {{and in its}} dissemination the cropmayexplore newhabitats. The advent of high-resolution climatemodels has greatly improved our capacity to characterise plant habitats, and study species’ adaptive responses. The yellow lupin (Lupinus luteus) is ideal because it evolved as a Mediterranean winter-annual in relatively high-rainfall coastal regions, but was domesticated as a summer crop in temperate central Europe. Currently the crop is being developed for Mediterranean south-western Australia, raising an interesting ecophysiological problem: is it more appropriate to concentrate onwildmaterial fromMediterraneanhabitats,which are likely to bemore similar to the target environments, or on European germplasm domesticated for temperate summer cropping? Lupinus luteus collection sites across the natural and domesticated distribution range were characterised by calculating site-specific <b>bioclimatic</b> variables and <b>habitat</b> types defined using multivariate analysis. Germplasmwas evaluated in 2 field trials measuring a range of characters describing plant growth, phenology, architecture, and productivity. The earliest phenology andhighest vigour andproductivitywere recorded in domesticatedmaterial fromcentral Europe, characterised by short but unstressful growing seasons with reliable rainfall, long day-lengths, and rapidly rising vegetative-phase temperatures levelling out after flowering. Mediterranean habitats were classified by altitude, climate, and growing-season length. Early, productive germplasm came from warmer/low elevation sites with inconsistent rainfall and stronge...|$|R

40|$|An {{improved}} {{approach to}} predicting preferred habitat and targetting survey effort for threatened plant species {{is needed to}} aid discovery and conservation of new populations. This study employs several approaches {{to aid in the}} delineation of preferred habitat for the Leafless Tongue Orchid, Cryptostylis hunteriana Nicholls. BIOCLIM, a bioclimatic analysis and prediction system, is used initially to generate a <b>bioclimatic</b> <b>habitat</b> envelope within which the species can be expected to occur, based on all known sites in the Shoalhaven Local Government Area. Within the BIOCLIM envelope it is possible to further investigate {{the extent to which the}} species exhibits preferences for other habitat factors such as geology, soil landscapes and forest ecosystems. Multivariate techniques are used to compare floristic data from sites where Cryptostylis hunteriana is present, and sites from forest ecosystems where it has not been recorded historically. These techniques are also used to identify species which are diagnostic of each of these sets of sites. All 25 sites with Cryptostylis hunteriana populations are restricted to six forest ecosystems having a total area of 15 % of the Shoalhaven Local Government Area and 47 % of the BIOCLIM envelope. Within these forest ecosystems, ten plant species deemed indicative of the possible presence of the Cryptostylis hunteriana are identified...|$|E
40|$|Projected {{climate change}} at a {{regional}} level {{is expected to}} shift vegetation habitat distributions over the next century. For the sub-alpine species whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), warming temperatures may indirectly result in loss of suitable <b>bioclimatic</b> <b>habitat,</b> reducing its distribution within its historic range. This research focuses on understanding the patterns of spatiotemporal variability for future projected P. albicaulis suitable habitat in the Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA) through a bioclimatic envelope approach. Since intermodel variability from General Circulation Models (GCMs) lead to differing predictions regarding the magnitude and direction of modeled suitable habitat area, nine bias-corrected statistically down-scaled GCMs were utilized to understand the uncertainty associated with modeled projections. P. albicaulis was modeled using a Random Forests algorithm for the 1980 - 2010 climate period and showed strong presence/absence separations by summer maximum temperatures and springtime snowpack. Patterns of projected habitat change {{by the end of}} the century suggested a constant decrease in suitable climate area from the 2010 baseline for both Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 8. 5 and 4. 5 climate forcing scenarios. Percent suitable climate area estimates ranged from 2 - 29 % and 0. 04 - 10 % by 2099 for RCP 8. 5 and 4. 5 respectively. Habitat projections between GCMs displayed a decrease of variability over the 2010 - 2099 time period related to consistent warming above the 1910 - 2010 temperature normal after 2070 for all GCMs. A decreasing pattern of projected P. albicaulis suitable habitat area change was consistent across GCMs, despite strong differences in magnitude. Future ecological research in species distribution modeling should consider a full suite of GCM projections in the analysis to reduce extreme range contractions/expansions predictions. The results suggest that restoration strageties such as planting of seedlings and controlling competing vegetation may be necessary to maintain P. albicaulis in the GYA under the more extreme future climate scenarios...|$|E
40|$|Using <b>bioclimatic</b> belts as <b>habitat</b> and {{distribution}} predictors, {{the present study}} examines {{the implications of the}} potential distributions of the three Iberian damselflies, Calopteryx Leach (Odonata: Calopterygidae), with the aim of investigating the possible consequences in specific interactions among the species from a sexual selection perspective and of discussing biogeographical patterns. To obtain the known distributions, the literature on this genus was reviewed, relating the resulting distributions to bioclimatic belts. Specific patterns related to bioclimatic belts were clearly observed in the Mediterranean region. The potential distribution maps and relative frequencies might involve latitudinal differences in relative abundances, C. virgo meridionalis Sélys being the most abundant species in the Eurosiberian region, C. xanthostoma (Charpentier) in the northern half of the Mediterranean region and C. haemorrhoidalis (Vander Linden) in the rest of this region. These differences might explain some previously described latitudinal differences in secondary sexual traits in the three species. Changes in relative abundances may modulate interactions among these species in terms of sexual selection and may produce sexual character displacement in this genus. C. virgo meridionalis distribution and ecological requirements explain its paleobiogeography as a species which took refuge in Iberia during the Würm glaciation. Finally, possible consequences in species distributions and interactions are discussed within a global climate change context...|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} question in biological conservation and invasion biology is {{why do some}} populations go extinct? Allee effects, notably those caused by mate location failure, are potentially key factors leading to the extinction of sparse populations. Several previous {{studies have focused on}} the inability of males and females to locate each other in space when populations are at low densities but here we investigate the effects of differences in the timing of male and female maturation on mating success. We develop a generalized model to clarify the role of protandry (the appearance of males before female emergence) and variability in adult maturation times. We show that temporal asynchrony can substantially reduce the probability of successful mating. We then apply this generalized model to estimate mating success in invading populations of the gypsy moth in North America in relation to local climate and its associated seasonality. Considerable geographic heterogeneity was observed in simulated mating success and this variability was not correlated with previous evaluations of <b>bioclimatic</b> requirements and <b>habitat</b> suitability. Furthermore, we found that the generalized model of temporal asynchrony provided reliable predictions and that detailed modeling of gypsy moth development was not necessary. One of the key questions that is critical to under-standing biological invasions is why many invasions fail. Considerable evidence indicates that only a smal...|$|R
40|$|International audienceKnowledge {{about the}} phylogenetic history, genetic {{variation}} and ecological {{requirements of a}} species is important for its conservation and management. Unfortunately, for many species this information is lacking. Here we use multiple approaches (phylogenetics, population genetics and ecological modelling) to evaluate the evolutionary history and conservation status of Capra walie, an endangered flagship species of wild goat endemic to Ethiopia. The analysis of mitochondrial cytochrome b and Y-chromosome DNA sequences suggests that C. walie forms a monophyletic clade with Capra nubiana, but potentially has been isolated for up to 0. 8 million years from this closely related species. Microsatellite DNA analyses show that C. walie has very low genetic variation (mean heterozygosity= 0. 35) compared with other endangered mammals. This reduced variation likely derives from a prolonged demographic decline and small effective population size. Ecological niche modelling using the <b>bioclimatic</b> features of <b>habitats</b> occupied by C. walie, suggests ecological differences between C. walie and C. nubiana, and identifies the areas most suitable for future reintroductions of C. walie. The genetic and bioclimatic data suggest that C. walie is distinct and requires immediate conservation actions including genetic monitoring and reintroductions to establish independent populations. This study illustrates how combining noninvasive sampling along with genetic and ecological (bioclimatic) approaches can help assess conservation status of poorly known species...|$|R
40|$|International audienceUnderstanding {{the effects}} of {{landscape}} change and environmental variability on ecological processes is important for evaluating resource management policies, such as the emulation of natural forest disturbances. We analyzed time series of detection/nondetection data using hierarchical models in a Bayesian multi-model inference framework to decompose the dynamics of species distributions into responses to environmental variability, spatial variation in habitat conditions, and population dynamics and interspecific interactions, while correcting for observation errors and variation in sampling regimes. We modeled distribution dynamics of 14 waterbird species (broadly defined, including wetland and riparian species) using data from two different breeding bird surveys collected in the Boreal Shield ecozone within Ontario, Canada. Temporal variation in species occupancy (2000 - 2006) was primarily driven by climatic variability. Only two species showed evidence of consistent temporal trends in distribution: Ring-necked Duck (Aythya collaris) decreased, and Red-winged Blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) increased. The models had good predictive ability on independent data over time (1997 - 1999). Spatial variation in species occupancy was strongly related to the distribution of specific land cover types and habitat disturbance: Fire and forest harvesting influenced occupancy more than did roads, settlements, or mines. <b>Bioclimatic</b> and <b>habitat</b> heterogeneity indices and geographic coordinates exerted negligible influence on most species distributions. Estimated habitat suitability indices had good predictive ability on spatially independent data (Hudson Bay Lowlands ecozone). Additionally, we detected effects of interspecific interactions. Species responses to fire and forest harvesting were similar for 13 of 14 species; thus, forest-harvesting practices in Ontario generally appeared to emulate {{the effects of}} fire for waterbirds over timescales of 10 - 20 years. Extrapolating to all 84 waterbird species breeding on the Ontario Boreal Shield, however, suggested that up to 30 species may instead have altered (short-term) distribution dynamics due to forestry practices. Hence, natural disturbances are critical components of {{the ecology of the}} boreal forest and forest practices which aim to approximate them may succeed in allowing the maintenance of the associated species, but improved monitoring and modeling of large-scale boreal forest bird distribution dynamics will be necessary to resolve existing uncertainties, especially on lesscommon species...|$|R
