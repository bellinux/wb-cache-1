5|$|As Plato tells it, the heckler {{hails from}} the small island of Seriphus; Themistocles retorts that {{it is true that}} he would not have been famous if he had come from that small island, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> the heckler would not have been famous either if he had been born in Athens.|$|E

5|$|Bogin {{observes that}} Thompson {{originated}} {{the use of}} transformational grids to measure growth in two dimensions, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> without modern computers the method was tedious to apply and was not often used. Even so, the book stimulated and lent intellectual validity to the new field of growth and development research.|$|E

5|$|Campy performances, cheesy special effects, and downright awful {{dialogue}} all {{contribute to}} making Jaws 3 a truly dismal experience for just about everyone.

5|$|Carey Sublette of Nuclear Weapon Archive {{argues that}} Ulam {{came up with}} the {{radiation}} implosion compression design of thermonuclear weapons, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> on the other hand Teller has gotten little credit for being the first to propose fusion boosting in 1945, which is essential for miniaturization and reliability and is used in all of today's nuclear weapons.|$|E
