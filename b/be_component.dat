Erhard and his colleagues, Michael C.

In their introduction the editors write, [...] "Erhard, Jensen and Granger anchor this collection by taking dead aim at the <b>BE</b> <b>component.</b> In a highly provocative chapter titled 'Creating Leaders', this eclectic group of scholars argues for adopting a decidedly ontological approach to leadership education...For these authors, integrity, authenticity, and being committed to something bigger than oneself form the base of 'the context for leadership', a context that once mastered, leaves one actually being a leader. It is not enough to know about or simply understand these foundational factors, but rather by following a rigorous, phenomenologically based methodology, students have the opportunity to create for themselves a context that leaves them actually being a leader and exercising leadership effectively as their natural self-expression." ...|$|E
40|$|The O 1 s x-ray {{photoelectron}} spectroscopy spectrum for Al(111) /O at 300 K shows {{two components}} whose {{behavior as a}} function of time and variation of detection angle are consistent with either (a) a surface species represented by the higher binding-energy (<b>BE)</b> <b>component</b> and a subsurface species represented by the lower <b>BE</b> <b>component,</b> or (b) small close-packed oxygen islands with the interior atoms represented by the lower <b>BE</b> <b>component</b> and the perimeter atoms by the higher <b>BE</b> <b>component.</b> We have modeled both situations using ab initio Hartree-Fock wave functions for clusters of Al and O atoms. For an O atom in a threefold site, it was found that a below-surface position gave a higher O 1 s BE than an above-surface position, incompatible with interpretation (a). This change in the O 1 s BE could arise because the bond for O to Al may have a more covalent character when the O is below the surface than when it is above the surface. We present evidence consistent with this view. An O adatom island with all the O atoms in threefold sites gives calculated O 1 s BE's which are significantly higher for the perimeter O atoms. Further, the results for an isolated O island without the Al substrate present also give higher BE¿s for the perimeter atoms. Both these results are consistent with interpretation (b). Published scanning-tunneling-microscopy data supports the suggestion that the chemisorbed state consists of small, close-packed islands, whereas the presence of two vibrational modes in high-resolution electron-energy-loss spectroscopy data has been interpreted as representing surface and subsurface oxygen atoms. In light of the present results, we suggest that a vibrational interpretation in terms of interior and perimeter adatoms should be considered...|$|E
