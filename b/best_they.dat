5|$|According to Bradman, Fingleton and O'Reilly, Lindwall's {{performance}} in the final Test at The Oval {{was one of the}} <b>best</b> <b>they</b> had ever seen from any player. English skipper Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch, surprising most observers. The damp conditions necessitated the addition of large amounts of sawdust to allow the players to keep their grip. Along with the rain, humidity assisted the bowlers, particularly Lindwall, who managed to make the ball bounce at variable heights.|$|E

In 1995, Judge Sheindlin published {{her first}} book, “Don’t Pee On My Leg and Tell Me It’s Raining,” {{in which she}} offers her insight into {{how and why the}} family court fails in its mission to impact shattered families. “Beauty Fades, Dumb Is Forever,” her second book, was published in January 1999. A New York Times best seller, the book challenges women to be the <b>best</b> <b>they</b> can be.|$|E

5|$|At 4:00 am on 25 August, {{the newly}} erected French gun battery {{opened fire on}} Sirius and Iphigenia, which {{returned}} fire as <b>best</b> <b>they</b> could. Accepting that Sirius was beyond repair, Pym removed all her personnel and military supplies, setting fire to the frigate at 9:00 am, shortly after Iphigenia had pulled beyond {{the range of the}} battery, using a cannon as an anchor after losing hers the previous day. French boats attempted to reach Sirius and capture her before she exploded, although they turned back when Pym launched his own boats to contest possession of the wreck. The frigate's remaining munitions exploded at 11:00 am. During the morning, Duperré sent an official boarding party aboard Nereide, who wet the decks to prevent any risk of fire from the ships burning in the harbour and removed 75 corpses from the frigate.|$|E
5|$|Attachments between {{infants and}} {{caregivers}} form {{even if this}} caregiver is not sensitive and responsive in social interactions with them. This has important implications. Infants cannot exit unpredictable or insensitive caregiving relationships. Instead they must manage themselves as <b>best</b> <b>they</b> can within such relationships. Based on her established Strange Situation Protocol, research by developmental psychologist Mary Ainsworth in the 1960s and 1970s found that children will have different patterns of attachment depending primarily on how they experienced their early caregiving environment. Early patterns of attachment, in turn, shape — but do not determine — the individual's expectations in later relationships.|$|E
5|$|Charles XI {{had complained}} of stomach pains since 1694. In {{the summer of}} 1696, he asked his doctors for an opinion on the pain as it had {{continuously}} become worse, {{but they had no}} viable cure or treatment for it. He continued to perform his duties as usual, but, in February 1697, the pains became too severe for him to cope and he returned to Stockholm where the doctors discovered he had a large, hard lump in his stomach. At this point there was little the doctors could do except alleviate the King's pain as <b>best</b> <b>they</b> could. Charles XI died on 5 April 1697, in his forty-first year. An autopsy showed that the King had developed cancer and that it had spread through his entire abdominal cavity.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the outpost on {{the left}} around the Isurava {{ridgeline}} held on throughout 27 August, but as the Japanese began bypassing the position, the order was given to withdraw across the ridgeline to the west. After this, frontal attacks against the dug-in defenders in the main defensive position began, representing the start {{of what would be}} four days of violent attacks. The attack was supported by a mountain gun and mortars that had been manhandled up the track. As the first wave fell on the position, the Australians sought to conceal their positions as <b>best</b> <b>they</b> could, firing as late as possible. Humidity and physical exertion sapped the strength of the attacking Japanese and the initial assault was held. That night, as heavy rain fell, the assault on the 39th around Isurava resumed, with a force penetrating the Australian positions around the abandoned garden.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} day of the battle the Persian fleet was ready to attack the Allied lines in full force. Seeing the Persian fleet assemble, the Allies {{attempted}} to block the Straits of Artemisium as <b>best</b> <b>they</b> could, and waited for the Persians to attack. The Persians formed their ships into a semicircle and tried to enclose the Allied fleet, upon which the Allies rowed forward and joined battle. The battle raged all day long, with the Allies hard put to defend their line. When the fleets finally disengaged at nightfall, both sides had suffered roughly equal losses. However, the smaller Allied fleet could scarcely afford such losses; half the Athenian ships (the largest contingent in the fleet) were damaged or lost.|$|E
5|$|Public {{reaction}} to the Emperor's speech varied–many Japanese simply listened to it, then went {{on with their lives}} as <b>best</b> <b>they</b> could, while some Army and Navy officers chose suicide over surrender. At a base north of Nagasaki, some Japanese Army officers, enraged at the prospect of surrender, pulled some 16 captured American airmen out of the base prison and hacked them to death with swords. A large, weeping crowd gathered in front of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, with their cries sometimes interrupted by the sound of gunshots as military officers present committed suicide.|$|E

5|$|Rowell was {{promoted}} to colonel on 13 October 1939, and when the government decided to form I Corps in April 1940, Blamey was given the command and Rowell became brigadier, general staff (BGS), with the rank of brigadier. Blamey and Rowell prepared I Corps for operations as <b>best</b> <b>they</b> could, completing the force's structure and integrating new units as they arrived in the Middle East. Rowell strove to establish {{good relations with the}} British Army, while occasionally having to remind them that the AIF was answerable to its own commander in chief and its own government. Rowell's efforts to create an administrative headquarters to free the I Corps staff for operational duties foundered on Blamey's reluctance to delegate authority. The best that he could achieve was the creation of a Base and Line of Communications Units command under Brigadier Allan Boase but I Corps remained responsible for organisation and training.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after dark, around 7:00p.m., {{the first}} Ottoman counterattack {{came after a}} group from the 1st Battalion, 57th Regiment, under Major Zeki Bey, arrived to {{reinforce}} the battalions of the 47th. Attacking with hand grenades, the fighting {{took place in the}} complicated maze of the former Ottoman trench system. The close quarters meant that some of the grenades would travel back and forth up to three times before exploding. The Australians held the old Ottoman fire trench and had footholds deeper in Ottoman lines. They blocked the Ottoman communications trenches as <b>best</b> <b>they</b> could, often with the bodies of the dead, to thwart raids. Other bodies were moved to unused communication trenches and saps, and where possible the wounded were evacuated, however, the fighting was so intense, the conditions so cramped and the men so exhausted that in many cases they were left to lie {{at the bottom of the}} trench.|$|E
5|$|The {{main problem}} the crew faced was the cold; in the morning, the {{temperatures}} peaked at around −22°F, while by mid-afternoon it often dropped to −50°.

Ice caverns producer Jaffe had scouted partially melted before filming; with only two-and-a-third days of time to film, the crew had to do the <b>best</b> <b>they</b> could. Batteries drained after minutes of filming in the cold, and the lack of snow was compensated by dropping fake precipitation into the scene by helicopter.|$|E

5|$|Arriving at Algeciras on 9 July, the {{combined}} squadron {{was ready to}} sail again on 12 July, departing Algeciras to the westwards during the evening. The British squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir James Saumarez, having effected its own hasty repairs, set off in pursuit. Finding that his ships were falling behind, Saumarez instructed his captains to separate and attack {{the combined}} squadron as <b>best</b> <b>they</b> were able to. The fastest ship was HMS Superb under Captain Richard Goodwin Keats, which sailed through the Spanish rearguard as a moonless night fell. Superb fired on the rearmost ships, setting the 112-gun Real Carlos on fire and capturing the Saint Antoine. Unable to determine friend from foe in the darkness, Real Carlos inadvertently engaged the Spanish ship San Hermenegildo, spreading the fire to its compatriot. Both ships subsequently exploded with enormous loss of life. A second stage of the battle then developed, as HMS Venerable took {{the lead of the}} British line, attacking the rearmost French ship Formidable under Captain Amable Troude. In a furious and protracted engagement, Venerable suffered heavy damage and was driven ashore, allowing the remainder of the French force to return to Cadiz without further fighting.|$|E
5|$|During {{a family}} {{vacation}} to New York when Lawrence was 14, she was spotted on the street by a talent scout who arranged for her to audition for agents. Lawrence's mother was not keen on allowing her to pursue an acting career, but briefly moved {{to the city to}} let her read for roles. After Lawrence's first cold reading, the agents said that hers was the <b>best</b> <b>they</b> had heard from someone that young; Lawrence's mother convinced her that they were lying. Lawrence said her early experiences were difficult as she felt lonely and friendless. She signed on with the CESD Talent Agency, who convinced her parents to let her audition for roles in Los Angeles. Lawrence's mother agreed to let her pursue acting on the condition that she graduate from high school. Lawrence was eventually home-schooled in Los Angeles, and graduated two years early with good grades. Considering acting to be a natural fit for her, she turned down several offers for modelling assignments at the time. Between her acting jobs in the city, she made regular visits to Louisville, during which she served as an assistant nurse at her mother's camp.|$|E
5|$|Rockefeller {{and his son}} {{continued}} to consolidate their oil interests as <b>best</b> <b>they</b> could until New Jersey, in 1909, changed its incorporation laws to effectively allow a re-creation of the trust {{in the form of}} a single holding company. Rockefeller retained his nominal title as president until 1911 and he kept his stock. At last in 1911, the Supreme Court of the United States found Standard Oil Company of New Jersey in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. By then the trust still had a 70% market share of the refined oil market but only 14% of the U.S. crude oil supply. The court ruled that the trust originated in illegal monopoly practices and ordered it to be broken up into 34 new companies. These included, among many others, Continental Oil, which became Conoco, now part of ConocoPhillips; Standard of Indiana, which became Amoco, now part of BP; Standard of California, which became Chevron; Standard of New Jersey, which became Esso (and later, Exxon), now part of ExxonMobil; Standard of New York, which became Mobil, now part of ExxonMobil; and Standard of Ohio, which became Sohio, now part of BP. Pennzoil and Chevron have remained separate companies.|$|E
