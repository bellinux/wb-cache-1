500|$|McKinley {{was easily}} re-elected as {{governor}} in 1893. [...] Despite the poor economic times in Ohio, he remained popular, and spoke {{across much of}} the nation for Republican candidates. [...] He followed the usual Ohio custom and stepped {{down at the end of}} two two-year terms, returning home to Canton in January 1896 to municipal celebrations. [...] The Canton Repository stated, [...] "It is just plain Mr. McKinley of Canton now, <b>but</b> <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> little while." [...] To devote full-time to McKinley's presidential campaign, Hanna in 1895 turned over management of his companies to his brother Leonard. Mark Hanna was certain, as he stated as McKinley's campaign began, that [...] "nothing short of a miracle or death will prevent his being the nominee of the party in '96".|$|E

6000|$|... "That's the way {{you feel}} jest now 'cause you're off your base; <b>but</b> <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> couple of hours, an' then you'll talk different." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just <b>a</b> suggestion, perhaps. <b>But</b> <b>wait</b> <b>an</b> instant!" [...] He stood upon a chair, and, {{holding up}} the light in his left hand, he curved his right arm over the broad hat and round the long ringlets.|$|R
50|$|The book closes with Mary's {{death at}} the hand of Moses. Mary is expecting his arrival and is aware of her {{imminent}} death. Moses does not run from the scene as he originally intends <b>but</b> <b>waits</b> <b>a</b> short distance away {{for the arrival of}} the police.|$|R
6000|$|Captain Jenness {{looked hard}} at her, <b>but</b> <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> decent season after saying grace before {{offering}} his compliment, {{which he did}} in drawing the carving-knife slowly across the steel. [...] "Well, Miss Blood, that's right!" [...] Lydia blushed richly, and the young men made their obeisances across the table.|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{it strikes}} me deeper than I thought. <b>But</b> <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> little--between us we'll make it out. You'll judge for that matter yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Lady: [...] "No; he didn't say. I have no {{idea where}} he is going. <b>But</b> <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> moment! I think I know where he meant to send the flowers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My Winkie!' said Tegumai. 'That's true too. <b>But</b> <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> minute. I see a difficulty. SO means [...] "come {{and have}} dinner," [...] but sho means the drying-poles where we hang our hides.' ...|$|E
60|$|We {{have had}} no other letter from our Egyptians, <b>but</b> can <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> little longer without losing our patience.|$|R
5000|$|Ragsdale {{was awarded}} the first {{scholarship}} from Bryn Mawr College for the top scholar Guilford College. She studied physics at Bryn Mawr College, obtaining an A.B. degree in 1896. [...] She was elected European fellow for the class of 1896, <b>but</b> <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> year before traveling, working as an assistant demonstrator in physics and mathematics graduate student at Bryn Mawr.|$|R
60|$|Soon {{afterward}} the Fosters rose to go, <b>but</b> they <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> {{few moments}} in the hall while Millicent lingered with Blake in the drawing-room.|$|R
6000|$|Ulr. [...] Stralenheim {{knows nothing}} [...] Of me as aught of kindred with yourself. [...] I will <b>but</b> <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> {{day or two}} with him [...] To lull all doubts, and then rejoin my father.|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{could he}} {{if he was}} at the ranch? <b>But</b> <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> minute! He said {{something}} about going fishing in that brook that flows through the woods. Maybe he did come up that way, after all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do still," [...] said Father Knickerbocker. [...] "I've {{never left}} the place. I'll show you around. <b>But</b> <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> bit--don't carry that handbag. I'll get a boy to call a porter to fetch a man to take it." ...|$|E
60|$|These counsels prevailed. It {{was decided}} not to attack the rioters immediately, <b>but</b> to <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> little, and see what turn things would take.|$|R
5000|$|Landreth, at {{the time}} {{employed}} by Alias, was [...] "immediately inspired" [...] to create a film based on Larkin's life, <b>but</b> <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> few months before acting on it. He met Larkin again in September during the Ottawa International Animation Festival, {{and asked him if}} he would agree to be the subject of a film. Larkin agreed, and on 13 February 2001, Landreth decided to make the film.|$|R
6000|$|I {{wondered}} what {{the subject of the}} picture was, <b>but</b> <b>waited</b> <b>an</b> opportunity to approach the speaker, while, as I did so, a young man said: [...] "I should rather like to take up your sister's challenge. Pulling the big catboat across here inside an hour without an air of wind was not exactly play; but can you tell us anything more about these tireless Westerners, Miss Lucille?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right; <b>but</b> <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> minute. There's {{one more}} thing--a thing that NOBODY don't know but me. And that is, there's a nigger here that I'm a-trying to steal out of slavery, {{and his name}} is JIM--old Miss Watson's Jim." ...|$|E
6000|$|Macallister grinned. [...] "Then I {{know which}} it will be. It was not me who swam across the harbour last trip. <b>But</b> <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> moment. There's a dozen or two Spaniards among the baskets, an' I'm {{thinking}} nobody would miss one of them." ...|$|E
60|$|THE MAIDEN. <b>But</b> <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> moment. Why {{will you}} {{not tell us}} how you enjoy yourself? You must have secret pleasures that you hide from us, and that you never get tired of. I get tired of all our dances and all our tunes. I get tired of all my partners.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{afraid to}} give you more now, my poor old man; <b>but</b> <b>wait,</b> like <b>a</b> dear, and I'll let you take it again when you're on the horse." ...|$|R
6000|$|Frederick {{made quite}} a {{preparation}} for what was to him a great undertaking. He sat counting the hours all the morning; and when at length the time arrived, his heart beat so violently, {{that it seemed to}} take away all the little strength he had. His uncle came in, <b>but</b> <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> few moments; then said, with some hesitation, [...] "Fred, you must be prepared to see her a good deal altered." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{seemed to}} say that she had, to her own mind, been liberal and gone far; <b>but</b> she <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> little. [...] "Do you think very, very much?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is," [...] said Psmith. [...] "In Comrade Windsor's pre-dungeon days he was wont to sit where I {{am sitting}} now, while I bivouacked over {{there at the}} smaller table. On busy mornings you could hear our brains buzzing in Madison Square Garden. <b>But</b> <b>wait!</b> <b>A</b> thought strikes me." [...] He called for Pugsy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Shameful, White Man!" [...] gasped Maputa; [...] "your {{words are}} true indeed. <b>But</b> <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> while. I, Maputa, will roll that stone over, I will throw that bull upon its back. When next the harvest ripens, this I promise, that neither Nahoon nor Umgona, {{nor any of}} his kraal shall be left to gather it." ...|$|E
6000|$|She is {{the child}} of gentle people; look [...] At her white hands and at her pretty dress. [...] I've brought you some new milk, <b>but</b> <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> while [...] And I will {{put it to the}} fire to warm, [...] For things well fitted for poor folk like us [...] Would never please a high-born child like you.|$|E
50|$|She was {{released}} May 20, 2008, <b>but</b> she is <b>waitting</b> <b>a</b> trial.|$|R

6000|$|The {{old woman}} was very angry. 'Oh, what a good-for-nothing fellow {{to want to}} spend all the money himself! <b>But</b> just <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> bit and see what I shall do.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! yes," [...] said Gerard, [...] "I {{believe our}} spirit is {{sufficiently}} broken at Mowbray. Wages weekly dropping, and just work enough to hinder sheer idleness; {{that sort of}} thing keeps the people in very humble trim. <b>But</b> <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> bit, and when they have reached the starvation point I fancy we shall hear a murmur." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pardon!" [...] Sarelli said again, {{raising his}} hat, [...] "that girl--the white girl--I saw. You {{do well to}} get away!" [...] he swayed a little as he walked. [...] "That old fellow--what is his name-Trrreffr-ry! What ideas of honour!" [...] He mumbled: [...] "Honour is an abstraction! If a man is not true to an abstraction, he is a low type; <b>but</b> <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> minute!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go {{down and}} unbar {{the door and}} swing it partly open," [...] said Poke Stover. [...] "That will attract the {{attention}} of the Injuns, and they won't be a-lookin' at the roof. <b>But</b> <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> minit, till I'm ready fer ye!" [...] he added, as he laboured up the ladder with a second bucket of the precious water. The old coat was soused thoroughly, and Stover opened the shutter nearest to the fire.|$|E

6000|$|... "I'm {{not sure}} that I did," [...] rejoined Harry. [...] "It may be that seeing that {{schooner}} put the thing into my head, <b>but</b> we'll <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> little now that we're up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Thorn, {{with a hint}} of embarrassment. [...] "I want Grace. It's {{an awkward}} situation. I don't want to urge that I deserve my reward, <b>but</b> I've <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> long time and thought you approved." ...|$|R
