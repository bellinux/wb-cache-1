5|$|Diving {{cylinders}} {{should only}} be filled with suitably filtered air from diving air compressors or with other <b>breathing</b> gases using gas blending or decanting techniques. In some jurisdictions, suppliers of <b>breathing</b> gases are required by legislation to periodically test the quality of compressed air produced by their equipment and to display the test results for public information. The standards for industrial gas purity and filling equipment and procedures may allow some contaminants at levels unsafe for <b>breathing,</b> and their use in <b>breathing</b> gas mixtures at high pressure could be harmful or fatal.|$|E
5|$|In {{patients}} of normal intelligence, rumination {{is not an}} intentional behavior and is habitually reversed using diaphragmatic <b>breathing</b> to counter the urge to regurgitate. Alongside reassurance, explanation and habit reversal, patients are shown how to breathe using their diaphragms prior to and during the normal rumination period. A similar <b>breathing</b> pattern {{can be used to}} prevent normal vomiting. <b>Breathing</b> in this method works by physically preventing the abdominal contractions required to expel stomach contents.|$|E
5|$|Open circuit scuba systems {{discharge}} the <b>breathing</b> {{gas into}} the environment as it is exhaled, and consist {{of one or more}} diving cylinders containing <b>breathing</b> gas at high pressure which is supplied to the diver through a diving regulator. They may include additional cylinders for decompression gas or emergency <b>breathing</b> gas.|$|E

5|$|Other {{problems}} arise when {{the concentration of}} metabolically active gases is increased. These range from the toxic effects of oxygen at high partial pressure, through buildup of carbon dioxide due to excessive work of <b>breathing,</b> increased dead space, or inefficient removal, to the exacerbation of the toxic effects of contaminants in the <b>breathing</b> gas due to the increased concentration at high pressures. Hydrostatic pressure differences between {{the interior of the}} lung and the <b>breathing</b> gas delivery, increased <b>breathing</b> gas density due to ambient pressure, and increased flow resistance due to higher <b>breathing</b> rates may all cause increased work of <b>breathing</b> and fatigue of the respiratory muscles.|$|E
5|$|Some pugs {{are also}} born with {{stenotic}} nares {{which can also}} inhibit their <b>breathing.</b> In serious cases, the pinched nostrils make <b>breathing</b> even more difficult for this breed and put added pressure on the larynx. In some cases, the dog could pass out from blocked airways. If this happens, one should inquire with their veterinarian whether or not surgery is needed to modify the <b>breathing</b> passages.|$|E
5|$|The <b>breathing</b> gas {{mixtures}} {{appropriate to}} a dive depend {{to a large}} extent on the maximum depth and the decompression obligations incurred by the planned duration of the dive and the time spent at each depth. The quantity of gases required for scuba will depend on the time spent at each depth, the <b>breathing</b> rate of the diver, the type of <b>breathing</b> apparatus to be used, and reasonable allowances for contingencies.|$|E

5|$|A diving {{cylinder}}, scuba tank or {{diving tank}} is a gas cylinder used to store and transport the high pressure <b>breathing</b> gas required by a scuba set. It {{may also be}} used for surface-supplied diving or as decompression gas or an emergency gas supply for surface supplied diving or scuba. Cylinders provide gas to the diver through the demand valve of a diving regulator or the <b>breathing</b> loop of a diving rebreather.|$|E
5|$|A typical {{hyperbaric}} oxygen {{treatment schedule}} is the US Navy Table 6, which {{provides for a}} standard treatment of 3 to 5 periods of 20 minutes of oxygen <b>breathing</b> at 60fsw (18msw) followed by 2 to 4 periods of 60 minutes at 30fsw (9msw) before surfacing. Air breaks are taken between oxygen <b>breathing</b> {{to reduce the risk}} of oxygen toxicity.|$|E

5|$|Alive or Just <b>Breathing</b> is {{the second}} studio album by American metalcore band Killswitch Engage. It was {{released}} on May 21, 2002, through Roadrunner Records. Alive or Just <b>Breathing</b> was Killswitch Engage's first album on Roadrunner and was recorded from October 2001 to February 2002. Produced by drummer and guitarist Adam Dutkiewicz, this was the band's first album on a major label, which prompted them to write and record the album {{to the best of}} their abilities. Alive or Just <b>Breathing</b> has been viewed as a landmark album in the metalcore genre and was well praised upon its release by fans and critics. The lyrics, which were all written by vocalist Jesse Leach, were intended to bring a positive message through the music.|$|E

5|$|Although xenon has {{potential}} {{for use in}} computed tomography (CT) to assess regional ventilation, its anesthetic properties limit its fraction in the <b>breathing</b> gas to 35%. A <b>breathing</b> mixture of 30% xenon and 30% krypton is comparable in effectiveness for CT to a 40% xenon fraction, while avoiding the unwanted effects of a high partial pressure of xenon gas.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} to self-contained <b>breathing</b> systems is to supply <b>breathing</b> gases {{from the surface}} through a hose. When combined with a communication cable, a pneumofathometer hose and a safety line {{it is called the}} diver's umbilical, which may include a hot water hose for heating, video cable and <b>breathing</b> gas reclaim line. More basic equipment that uses only an air hose is called an airline or hookah system. This allows the diver to breathe using an air supply hose from a cylinder or compressor at the surface. <b>Breathing</b> gas is supplied through a mouth-held demand valve or light full-face mask. It is used for work such as hull cleaning and archaeological surveys, for shellfish harvesting, and as snuba, a shallow water activity typically practised by tourists and those who are not scuba-certified.|$|E

5|$|Deck {{decompression}} chambers {{are used}} for surface decompression, described in a previous section. Most deck decompression chambers are fitted with built in <b>breathing</b> systems (BIBS), which supply an alternative <b>breathing</b> gas to the occupants (usually oxygen), and discharge the exhaled gas outside the chamber, so the chamber gas is not excessively enriched by oxygen, which would cause an unacceptable fire hazard, and require frequent flushing with chamber gas (usually air).|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} in newborn infants with <b>breathing</b> difficulties is {{difficult in the}} first few weeks. However, if the infant's <b>breathing</b> does not improve during this time, blood tests and x-rays may be used to confirm {{bronchopulmonary dysplasia}}. In addition, an echocardiogram can help to eliminate other possible causes such as congenital heart defects or pulmonary arterial hypertension.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decade}} {{following}} World War II, Lambertsen et al. made further discoveries {{on the effects}} of <b>breathing</b> oxygen under pressure and methods of prevention.
