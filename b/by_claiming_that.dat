5|$|In May 1957, the Egyptologist Margaret Murray {{involved}} {{herself in}} the Gogmagog debate, championing Lethbridge's ideas against the academic fraternity in a letter she sent to The Times. W. F. Grimes responded <b>by</b> <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> {{she was out of}} touch with contemporary scholarship.|$|E
5|$|Booth {{worked his}} way into the company with a string of false claims about his influence, and finally became {{chairman}} of the Board of Directors <b>by</b> <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> {{it was the only way}} to avoid Gruban being interned due to his German origin. As soon as this happened, he cut Gruban out of the company, leaving him destitute, and eventually arranged for him to be interned. Gruban successfully appealed against the internment, and brought Booth to court.|$|E
5|$|Public opinion, {{based upon}} the {{immediate}} media furore resulted in (according to one BBC poll) 90% of respondents believing Hoddle should not continue as English coach. However, the BBC survey showed that while many considered his comments insensitive to the disabled, others defended his right to express his religious beliefs <b>by</b> <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> to sack him would constitute religious discrimination.|$|E

5|$|There was an {{unsubstantiated}} {{rumor that}} Lucasfilm pressured Paramount {{to change the}} film's original working title, The Vengeance of Khan, claiming {{that it was too}} close to the working title for their upcoming Star Wars film. However, as soon as the name change was made, Lucasfilm also changed their title to Return of the Jedi, justifying the change <b>by</b> <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> the Jedi did not seek revenge, only the Sith.|$|E
5|$|Even {{in ancient}} times these {{similarities}} were controversial. Non-Christians in the Roman Empire in the early centuries CE thought Christianity and the mystery cults resembled each other. Reacting to these claims by outsiders, early Christian apologists denied that these cults had influenced their religion. The 17th-century Protestant scholar Isaac Casaubon brought up the question again by accusing the Catholic Church of deriving its sacraments from the rituals of the mystery cults. Charles-François Dupuis, in the late 18th century, went further <b>by</b> <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> all Christianity originated in the mystery cults. Intensified by religious disputes between Protestants, Catholics, and non-Christians, the controversy has continued to the present day.|$|E
5|$|On January 28, Khánh {{flew from}} Huế to Saigon dressed in {{civilian}} clothes on a commercial airliner. He covered for his ruse <b>by</b> <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> he was travelling with United States military adviser Colonel Jasper Wilson and stating {{that he had come}} for a dental appointment. This came after Duc had arrived in I Corps earlier in the day with a message from the other plotters that Khánh was to be in Saigon to lead the coup on the day after. What Khánh had actually done was to send Wilson to Saigon earlier in the day to check with the embassy and confirm that Washington did support the coup.|$|E

25|$|This {{violence}} was fed <b>by</b> <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> Catholics were destroying {{the culture of}} the United States. Irish Catholic immigrants were blamed for raising the taxes of the country as well as for spreading violence and disease.|$|R
5|$|On May 19, 1993, Clinton fired seven {{employees}} of the White House Travel Office, causing the White House travel office controversy even though the travel office staff served {{at the pleasure of}} the president and could be dismissed without cause. The White House responded to the controversy <b>by</b> <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> the firings were done in response to financial improprieties that had been revealed by a brief FBI investigation. Critics contended that the firings had been done to allow friends of the Clintons to take over the travel business and the involvement of the FBI was unwarranted.|$|E
5|$|The Bill of Middlesex was a {{legal fiction}} {{used by the}} Court of King's Bench to gain {{jurisdiction}} over cases traditionally in the remit of the Court of Common Pleas. Hinging on the King's Bench's remaining criminal jurisdiction over the county of Middlesex, the Bill allowed it to take cases traditionally in the remit of other common law courts <b>by</b> <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> the defendant had committed trespass in Middlesex. Once the defendant was in custody, the trespass complaint would be quietly dropped and other complaints (such as debt or detinue) would be substituted.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} male over-representation {{in terms of}} total number of sports and athletes is structural. In the United Kingdom, for example, more male athletes than female ones receive {{financial}} support. Sports officials rationalise this uneven distribution <b>by</b> <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> there are more opportunities for men to win {{at the highest level}} than there are for women. The importance of being part of the Summer Olympics is illustrated by softball, and the benefits the sport derived from its inclusion. This included additional media coverage, especially during Olympic years. Olympic recognition plays an important part in getting sponsorship for local competitions around the world and providing new opportunities for females.|$|E
50|$|The 2011 Argentina-United States {{diplomatic}} {{crisis was}} caused by the temporary seizure of materials from a US military plane, followed <b>by</b> <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> the US may have been trying to smuggle weapons and drugs into the country.|$|R
5000|$|The disquotational {{principle}} is a philosophical theorem {{which holds that}} a rational speaker will accept [...] "p" [...] {{if and only if}} he or she believes p. The quotes indicate that the statement p is being treated as a sentence, and not as a proposition. This {{principle is}} presupposed <b>by</b> <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> hold that substitution fails in certain intensional contexts.|$|R

5|$|According to the Augustan History, Zenobia's {{descendants}} were Roman nobility {{during the}} reign of Emperor Valens (reigned 364–375). Eutropius and Jerome chronicled the queen's descendants in Rome during the fourth and fifth centuries. They may have been the result of a reported marriage to a Roman spouse or offspring who accompanied her from Palmyra; both theories, however, are tentative. Zonaras is the only historian to note that Zenobia had daughters; he wrote that one married Aurelian, who married the queen's other daughters to distinguished Romans. According to Southern, the emperor's marriage to Zenobia's daughter is a fabrication. Another descent claim is the relation of saint Zenobius of Florence with the queen; the Girolami banking family claimed descent from the fifth century saint, and the alleged relation was first noted in 1286. The family also extended their roots to Zenobia <b>by</b> <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> the saint was a descendant of her.|$|E
5|$|Demosthenes {{relied heavily}} on the {{difference}} aspects of ethos, especially phronesis. When presenting himself to the Assembly, he had to depict himself as a credible and wise statesman and adviser {{in order to be}} persuasive. One tactic that Demosthenes used during his philippics was foresight. He pleaded with his audience to predict the potential of being defeated, and to prepare. He appealed to pathos through patriotism and introducing the atrocities that would befall Athens if it was taken over by Philip. He was a master at “self-fashioning” by referring to his previous accomplishments, and renewing his credibility. He would also slyly undermine his audience <b>by</b> <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> they had been wrong to not listen before, however they could redeem themselves if they listened and acted with him presently.|$|E
5|$|For his part, Minh resented that he {{had been}} deposed by a younger officer whom he viewed as an unscrupulous upstart. Minh was also upset with the {{detention}} of his fellow generals and around 30 of his junior officers. The latter group was set free when Minh made this a condition for his serving as the figurehead chief of state. Khánh attempted to avoid the issue of substantiating the alleged neutralist plot {{for as long as he}} could, and then tried to revive it <b>by</b> <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> French agents were attempting to assassinate him and to enforce neutralism. Khánh offered no evidence, only claiming that the French had paid a hitman US$1300 to kill him, before later inflating the supposed reward for his assassination. American intelligence officials in Vietnam privately said that they were not aware of any such threat.|$|E
50|$|However, Azerbaijani-Lezgin {{relations}} {{continued to}} be complicated <b>by</b> <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> Islamic fundamentalism enjoyed disproportionate popularity among Lezgins. In July 2000 Azerbaijani security forces arrested members of Lezgin and Avar ethnicity of a group named the Warriors of Islam, which allegedly was planning an insurgency against the Azerbaijani state.|$|R
5000|$|One {{advocate}} of the democratic peace explains that his reason to choose a definition of democracy sufficiently restrictive to exclude all wars between democracies are what [...] "might be disparagingly termed public relations": students and politicians will be more impressed <b>by</b> such a <b>claim</b> than <b>by</b> <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> wars between democracies are less likely.|$|R
50|$|Amal {{reached its}} peak of {{influence}} in Lebanese affairs in 1985, but was challenged <b>by</b> Hezbollah <b>by</b> <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> Amal collaborated with Israel and the United States and was inefficient and corrupt. This rivalry reached a peak {{in the latter part}} of 1990 that required a ceasefire, effective in December 1990.|$|R
5|$|Milburn {{felt that}} the opening {{chapters}} (and introduction) did well to establish the volume, and was happy with {{the inclusion of the}} more empirical contributions, given their potential theoretical significance. He picked out the chapters by Driessen, Boyer and Wissenburg respectively as highlights, suggesting that the contributions of Driessen and Boyer seemed to challenge the volume's second stated goal, and noting that, though it was strong, he disagreed with the claims of Wissenburg's chapter. Garner highlighted the contributions of Flanders and Driessen, and commended the editors for putting together the book. Hooley concluded his review <b>by</b> <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> the book offered something to those interested in the place of animals in politics, but that much of its contents would be of more interest for those looking to read about environmental political theory.|$|E
5|$|The final victim, {{killed on}} 31 October 1828, was Margaret Docherty, a middle-aged Irish woman. Burke lured {{her into the}} Broggan lodging house <b>by</b> <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> his mother was also a Docherty from the same area of Ireland, and the pair began drinking. At one point Burke left Docherty {{in the company of}} Helen McDougal while he went out, ostensibly to buy more whisky, but {{actually}} to get Hare. Two other lodgers—Ann and James Gray—were an inconvenience to the men, so they paid them to stay at Hare's lodging for the night, claiming Docherty was a relative. The drinking continued into the evening, by which time Margaret Hare had joined in. At around 9:00pm the Grays returned briefly to collect some clothing for their children, and saw Burke, Hare, their wives and Docherty all drunk, singing and dancing. Although Burke and Hare came to blows {{at some point in the}} evening, they subsequently murdered Docherty, and put her body in a pile of straw at the end of the bed.|$|E
5|$|The prosecution's case rested {{largely on}} their {{contention}} that Kinne {{had been so}} interested in seeing her husband removed {{that she had been}} willing to pay for his murder, supported by the grand-jury testimony of John Boldizs. Boldizs, though nominally a witness for the prosecution, weakened his testimony on the stand during the trial <b>by</b> <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> Kinne's offer to pay him $1,000 in return for James Kinne's murder could have been a joke, and Hill was forced to attack his own witness's credibility. Further prosecution testimony alleged that the Kinne's marriage had been on the verge of dissolution at the time of James Kinne's death, that Sharon Kinne's adultery had been a cause of this, and that Sharon Kinne had known that she would collect her husband's $29,000 in life insurance policies only if she were still his wife.|$|E
50|$|On 26 April 1889, four Frenchmen {{and their}} two bears were making their way to Ruardean, having {{performed}} in Cinderford. They were attacked by an angry mob, enraged <b>by</b> <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> the bears had killed a child and injured a woman. The bears were killed and the Frenchmen badly beaten.|$|R

25|$|Mahathir's {{supporters}} {{insisted that}} it had liberated the Malaysian judiciary from a colonial mindset. The sacking of several justices was justified <b>by</b> <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> these judges had been abusing public funds for their personal expenses — such as the purchase of luxury furniture from Italy. It was also <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> the sackings had eliminated deadwood and improved efficiency in the courts, as evinced by a reduction in their backlog.|$|R
5|$|The {{themes of}} Reflections {{are similar to}} those of The Eolian Harp. They are set in the same location, and both {{describe}} Coleridge's relationship with his wife and sexual desire. The reflection on his life within the poem represent an unwillingness to accept his current idyllic life and a rejection of the conclusion drawn in The Eolian Harp. Although the land of Clevedon can bring one closer to God in Coleridge's view, he reflects on how one cannot simply exist in such an area but must actively seek out truth in order to fulfill God's will. The poem details how men feel a need to seek truth like a philosopher while also desiring to simply live in an idyllic natural state. The poem reconciles these desires <b>by</b> <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> the pursuer of truth can still reflect back on his time when he was simply enjoying nature and God's presence.|$|E
5|$|The {{thesis of}} eliminativism {{seems to be}} so {{obviously}} wrong to many critics, under the claim that people know immediately and indubitably that they have minds, that argumentation seems unnecessary. This sort of intuition pumping is illustrated by asking what happens when one asks oneself honestly if one has mental states. Eliminativists object to such a rebuttal of their position <b>by</b> <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> intuitions often are mistaken. Analogies {{from the history of}} science are frequently invoked to buttress this observation: it may appear obvious that the sun travels around the earth, for example, but for all its apparent obviousness this conception was proved wrong nevertheless. Similarly, it may appear obvious that apart from neural events there are also mental conditions. Nevertheless, this could equally turn out to be false.|$|E
5|$|Vietnamese {{migrant workers}} started to arrive from 1992 onwards {{due to the}} {{creation}} of new job opportunities by the UNTAC administration. At the same time, the UNTAC administration allowed the opening of political offices and political parties such as FUNCINPEC and the BLDP began to propagate anti-Vietnamese sentiments among the populace to shore up electorate support in the 1993 general elections. In November 1992, the Khmer Rouge which controlled northwestern parts of Cambodia, passed a resolution to target systematic killings of Vietnamese soldiers and civilians. The first guerrilla-style attacks by the Khmer Rouge on Vietnamese civilians started in December 1992, and Khmer Rouge soldiers justified the killings <b>by</b> <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> some of the civilians were Vietnamese soldiers in disguise. The spate of killings by Khmer Rouge prompted some 21,000 ethnic Vietnamese to flee to Vietnam in March 1993.|$|E
25|$|Those Christian groups {{regarded}} as heretics by the Roman Catholic Church were treated differently, with theologians arguing {{that they were}} deliberately worshipping the Devil. This was accompanied <b>by</b> <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> such individuals engaged in incestuous sexual orgies, murdered infants, and committed acts of cannibalism, all stock accusations {{that had previously been}} levelled at Christians themselves in the Roman Empire.|$|R
40|$|The Australian Labor Government {{has pursued}} a high {{migration}} policy since {{it came to}} office in late 2007.

50|$|The {{link with}} Scientology raised {{questions}} about the constitutional appropriateness of governmental bodies sponsoring a religiously affiliated organization (see Lemon v. Kurtzman).
