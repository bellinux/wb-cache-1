5|$|Péron did {{not report}} seeing any emus on the island himself, which might explain why he {{described}} them as being the size of mainland birds. Instead, most {{of what is known}} about the King Island emu today stems from a 33-point questionnaire that he used to interview a local English sealer, Daniel Cooper, about the <b>bird.</b> <b>In</b> accordance with a request by the authorities for the expedition to bring back useful plants and animals, Péron asked if the emus could be bred and fattened in captivity, and received a variety of cooking recipes. Péron's questionnaire remained unpublished until 1899, and very little was therefore known about the <b>bird</b> <b>in</b> life until then.|$|E
5|$|Subfossils {{were also}} {{recovered}} during the 1860s, but more complete remains were found during the 1874 transit of Venus, since an observation station was {{located on the}} island. Many of these excavations were requested by brothers Alfred and Edward Newton, who used them to describe the osteology of the <b>bird</b> <b>in</b> detail. Thousands of bones were excavated, and mounted skeletons were composed from the remains of several specimens. It {{has been suggested that}} the skeleton of this species is the best described after that of humans. In spite of this, some later scholars doubted Leguat's story, and the existence of the Rodrigues solitaire. In 1955, George Evelyn Hutchinson doubted aspects of the bird's biology mentioned by Leguat, and in 1921, G. Atkinson claimed the memoir was merely a novel, and that the man had never even existed. Today, it is widely accepted that Leguat's memoirs are credible observations of the <b>bird</b> <b>in</b> life.|$|E

5|$|A 1940 {{expedition}} by the American Museum of Natural History yielded more {{fossils of}} giant crocodilians, {{this time from}} Big Bend National Park in Texas.

Donald Baird and Jack Horner later assigned the Big Bend remains to Deinosuchus, which has been accepted by most modern authorities. The genus name Phobosuchus, which was initially created by Baron Franz Nopcsa in 1924, has since been discarded because it contained {{a variety of different}} crocodilian species that turned out to not be closely related to each other.|$|E
5|$|Albatrosses live {{much longer}} than other birds; they delay {{breeding}} for longer and invest more effort into fewer young. Most species survive upwards of 50 years, the oldest recorded being a Laysan albatross named Wisdom that was ringed in 1956 as a mature adult and hatched another chick in February 2017, making her at least 66 years old. She is the oldest confirmed wild bird {{as well as the}} oldest banded <b>bird</b> <b>in</b> the world.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} the adrenal response to handling stress of <b>birds</b> <b>in</b> different body conditions. In order {{to affect the}} birds’ body condition, young (73 -d old) female American kestrels (Falco sparverius) were maintained for 6 wk on one of three diets: a control diet (fed ad lib.) and two calorically restricted diets. To invoke a stress response, we removed birds from their cages and took repeated blood samples {{over the course of}} an hour. All birds responded to handling stress with an increase in plasma corticosterone, but control <b>birds</b> (<b>in</b> good body condition) showed a more rapid increase to maximum corticoste rone levels, followed by a decrease. Both groups of food-restricted birds had a slower rate of increase to maximum corticosterone levels and then maintained high corticosterone levels through 60 min. These results suggest that <b>birds</b> <b>in</b> good physical condition respond more quickly to stressors and adapt physiologically to stressful situations more rapidly than do <b>birds</b> <b>in</b> poor physical condition. This difference may reflect the ability of <b>birds</b> <b>in</b> good condition to mobilize fat for energy, while <b>birds</b> <b>in</b> poor condition must mobilize protein (i. e., muscle) ...|$|R
