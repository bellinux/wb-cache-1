5|$|In November 1978, Christina Crawford {{published}} Mommie Dearest, {{which contained}} allegations that her late adoptive mother was emotionally and physically abusive to Christina {{and her brother}} Christopher because she {{was more interested in}} her career than in <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>mother.</b> Many of Crawford's friends and co-workers, including Van Johnson, Ann Blyth, Marlene Dietrich, Myrna Loy, Katharine Hepburn, Cesar Romero, Gary Gray, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (Crawford's first husband), and Crawford's two other younger daughters—Cathy and Cindy—denounced the book, categorically denying any abuse. But others, including Betty Hutton, Helen Hayes, James MacArthur (Hayes' son), June Allyson, Liz Smith, Rex Reed, and Vincent Sherman stated they had witnessed some form of abusive behavior. Crawford's secretary, Jeri Binder Smith, confirmed Christina's account. Mommie Dearest became a bestseller and was made into the 1981 biographical film Mommie Dearest, starring Faye Dunaway as Crawford.|$|E

25|$|A {{report of}} the 1888 London press of Kelly <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> has led a {{minority}} of historians to suggest {{the birth of a}} younger Davies between 1879 and 1882.

25|$|The plaintiffs {{were seeking}} {{compensation}} from the Commonwealth for wrongful imprisonment and deprivation of liberty. For {{seven of the}} plaintiffs, Alec Kruger, Hilda Muir, Connie Cole, Peter Hansen, Kim Hill, George Ernest Bray, Janet Zita Wallace and Marjorie Foster, the claim was based on their removal from their families while they were children between 1925 and 1944. The claim of the eighth plaintiff, Rosie Napangardi McClary, was based on her <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> whose daughter had been removed.
