In order to improve the utilization of water resources in such regions, water storage engineering has been considered; however, site selection and cost associated with the special karstic geological structure have made this difficult. According {{to the principle of}} the Soil Plant Atmosphere Continuum, increasing both vegetation cover and soil thickness would change water cycle process, resulting in a transformation from leaked <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> (liquid form) into green <b>water</b> (<b>gas</b> or saturated <b>water</b> form) for terrestrial plant ecosystems, thereby improving the utilization of water resources. Using the Soil Vegetation Atmosphere Transfer model and the geographical distributed approach, this study simulated the conversion from leaked <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> (leakage) into green water in the environs of Guiyang, a typical degraded karst area. The primary results were as follows: (1) Green water in the area accounted for normal year > rainy year. Thus, increased soil thickness was shown effective in improving the utilization ratio of water resources and in raising the amount of plant ecological water use; (4) The transformation of <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> into green water, which avoids constructions of hydraulic engineering, could provide an alternative solution for the improvement of the utilization of water resources in degraded karst area. Although there are inevitable uncertainties in simulation process, it has important significance for overcoming similar problems...|$|R

Environmental flow requirements were estimated based on the presumptive standard for environmental flow protection as proposed by Richter et al. (2011), which can be regarded as a precautionary estimate of environmental flow requirements. Within the study period 1996 - 2005, in 223 river basins (55 % of the basins studied) with in total 2. 72 billion inhabitants (69 % of the total population living in the basins included in this study), the <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> scarcity level exceeded one hundred per cent during at least one month of the year, which means that environmental flow requirements were violated during at least one month of the year. In 201 river basins with in total 2. 67 billion people there was severe water scarcity, which means that the <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> footprint was more than twice the <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> availability, during at least one month per year. Global average <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> scarcity – estimated by averaging the annual average monthly <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> scarcity values per river basin weighted by basin area – is 85 %. This is the average <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> scarcity over the year within the total land area considered in this study. When we weight the annual average monthly <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> scarcity values per river basin according to population number per basin, global average <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> scarcity is 133 %. This is the average scarcity as experienced by the people in the world. This population-weighted average scarcity is higher than the area-weighted scarcity because the water scarcity values in densely populated areas – which are often higher than in sparsely populated areas – get more weight. Yet another way of expressing water scarcity is to take the perspective of the average water consumer. The global water consumption pattern is different from the population density pattern, because intensive water consumption in agriculture is not specifically related to where most people live. If we estimate global <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> scarcity by averaging monthly <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> scarcity values per river basin weighted based on the <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> footprint in the respective month and basin, we calculate a global <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> scarcity at 244 %. This means that the average <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> consumer in the world experiences a water scarcity of 244 %, i. e. operates in a month in a basin in which the <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> footprint is 2. 44 times the <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> availability and in which presumptive environmental flow requirements are thus strongly violated. The data presented in this report should be taken with care. The quality of the presented <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> scarcity data depends on the quality of the underlying data. The estimates of both monthly <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> footprint and monthly <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> availability per river basin can easily contain an error of ± 20 per cent, but a solid basis for making a precise error statement is lacking. This obviously needs additional research. Furthermore, improvements in the estimates can be made by including the effect of dams on the <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> availability over time, by accounting for inter-basin water transfers, by distinguishing between surface water, renewable groundwater and fossil groundwater, by improving estimates of environmental flow requirements, by looking at water scarcity at the level of sub-basins, and by considering inter-annual variability as well. Despite this great room for improvement and bringing in more detail, the current study is a milestone in global water scarcity studies by mapping water scarcity for the first time on a monthly basi...|$|R

5000|$|The most {{important}} use of manufactured {{gas in the}} early 19th century was for gas lighting, as a convenient substitute for candles and oil lamps in the home. Gas lighting became the first widespread form of street lighting. For this use, gases that burned with a highly luminous flame, [...] "illuminating gases", were needed, in contrast to other uses (e.g. as fuel) where the heat output was the main consideration. Accordingly some gas mixtures of low intrinsic luminosity, such as <b>blue</b> <b>water</b> <b>gas,</b> were enriched with oil {{to make them more}} suitable for street lighting.|$|E

Gas oil (an early form of gasoline) was the flammable waste product from kerosene refining, made from the lightest and most volatile fractions (tops) of crude oil.In 1875 Thaddeus S. C. Lowe invented the carburetted water gas process. This process revolutionized the manufactured gas industry and was the standard technology until the end of manufactured gas era. A CWG generating set consisted of three elements; a producer (generator), carburettor and a super heater connected in series with gas pipes and valves.|$|E
