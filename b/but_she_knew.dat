25|$|VanDerveer was {{determined}} to play basketball in college. Her first choice was Mount Holyoke, but as one of five children, it wasn't financially possible for her to attend Mount Holyoke, so she chose Albany where her father had studied for his doctorate. It wasn't a great team, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> the coach, which helped with the decision. The team turned out not be challenging enough. Although naturally a guard, she jumped center, and lead the team in many categories, despite being the freshman on the team. She decided she needed a bigger challenge so she talked some of her friends into attending the AIAW National Championship, where she watched many teams, took notes, and decided where she wanted to go. She chose Indiana where she transferred and spent three years, making the Dean's List {{each of the three}} years. In her sophomore year, 1973 she helped the team reach the Final Four of the AIAW championship, losing in the semi-finals to Queens College.|$|E
500|$|McIlwraith was an {{experienced}} magazine editor, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> little about weird fiction, and unlike Wright {{she also had}} to face real competition from other magazines for Weird Tales core readership. [...] Although Unknown folded in 1943, in its four years of existence it transformed the field of fantasy and horror, and Weird Tales was no longer regarded as the leader in its field. [...] Unknown published many successful humorous fantasy stories, and McIlwraith responded by including some humorous material, but Weird Tales rates were less than Unknown, with predictable effects on quality. [...] In 1940 the policy of reprinting horror and weird classics ceased, and Weird Tales began using the slogan [...] "All Stories New – No Reprints". [...] Weinberg suggests {{that this was a}} mistake, as Weird Tales readership appreciated getting access to classic stories [...] "often mentioned but rarely found". [...] Without the reprints Weird Tales was left to survive on the rejects from Unknown, with the same authors selling to both markets. [...] In Weinberg's words, [...] "only the quality of the stories [...] their work between the two pulps".|$|E
2500|$|A former student, Mary Peterson, {{recalled}} Kathryn Seller's kindness {{later in}} life: [...] "Mrs. Seller – Kathryn Seller – was my teacher. She {{was kind of}} old already, with gray, short hair. She was everything to us. She helped people that needed food...I don't know where she ordered them from, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> {{some of the people}} in the village who were in need because they had no money to buy food." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Dora!' said Helen; 'yes, she {{has always}} been tolerably good, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> nearly as much as I do. Lizzie says <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> the reasons of a {{multiplication}} sum, and I am sure I do not.' ...|$|R

2500|$|But Melbourne was not New York. King {{found it}} “almost Victorian”. Her first {{impression}} of her adopted country was: “Rather flat, like {{a can of}} flat beer.” But, she said, “I {{made up my mind}} I will not look back. You see, I had emigrated once, and the first emigration is the hardest to adjust to. I think people do not realise that. ... these experiences ... fundamentally it does something to your whole system.” She was unable to make sculpture for several years. <b>But</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that she could not go back to Germany to live.|$|E
2500|$|Along with Empower America co-directors William Bennett and Jack Kemp, {{she called}} on the Congress to issue a formal {{declaration}} of war against the [...] "entire fundamentalist Islamist terrorist network" [...] {{the day after the}} September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center. In 2003, she headed the US delegation to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. Kirkpatrick was appointed to the Board of Directors of IDT Corp. in 2004. It was revealed after her death that in 2003, she was sent as a US envoy, to meet an Arab delegation and attempt to convince them to support the Iraq War; she was supposed to argue that pre-emptive war was justifiable, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that it would not work and instead argued that Saddam Hussein had consistently gone against the UN. However she described George W. Bush as [...] "a bit too interventionist for my taste" [...] and felt that what she described as [...] "moral imperialism" [...] was not [...] "taken seriously anywhere outside a few places in Washington, DC." ...|$|E
2500|$|James P. Allen commented [...] "Sometimes you weren't {{sure whether}} Omm Sety wasn't pulling your leg. Not {{that she was}} a phoney in what she said or {{believed}} – she was absolutely not a con artist – <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that some people looked on her as a crackpot, so she kind of fed into that notion and let you go either way with it...She believed enough to make it spooky, and it made you doubt your own sense of reality sometimes." [...] Barbara Lesko wrote, [...] "She was a great help to Egyptian scholars, especially Hassan and Fakhry, correcting their English and writing English language articles for others. So this poorly educated Englishwoman developed in Egypt into a first rate draughtswoman and prolific and talented writer who, even under her own name, produced articles, essays, monographs and books of great range, wit and substance." [...] William Golding wrote of the Egyptologists he met in his travels through Egypt in the 1980s who were [...] "as well disposed to the Mystery as any child could have wished." [...] When [...] "the question arose of a dear lady who believed herself to have been a priestess of a particular temple, they did not dismiss her as a crackpot but agreed that she had something." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A folly--at such a time," [...] Sautron insisted. The Marquis {{looked a}} question. The Count {{answered}} it. [...] "Aline," [...] said he, pregnantly. [...] "She <b>knows.</b> How <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> I can't tell you, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows,</b> and <b>she</b> is deeply offended." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' said Albinia, 'one cannot but honour her motives, though I {{think she}} is mistaken; and I am sorry for her; <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> better than {{to be afraid of}} me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Just a woman's wiles. At {{this moment}} she can't hear us, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> pretty nearly {{what we are}} saying by the way our lips are going. Have you spoken to her?' ...|$|R

60|$|Wine, Feemy {{was going}} to say, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> she had none to offer.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that {{it would}} not be ladylike to do that: so she was silent.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{has left}} off trying to gloss {{it over with}} me, except {{so far as it}} is part of her nature. She did at first, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> it is of no use now." ...|$|R
50|$|At {{the garden}} meeting, Marthe flirts with Mephistopheles, {{and he is}} at pains to reject her unconcealed advances. Gretchen confesses her love to Faust, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> instinctively that his {{companion}} (Mephistopheles) has improper motives.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why can't she care? I suppose I'm nothing much, <b>but</b> <b>she's</b> <b>known</b> me all her life, and {{she used}} to like me. There's something--I can't make out. Could you do {{anything}} for me with her?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, {{it bought}} him the prettiest wife in England, {{and that was}} some good that {{he got out of}} it. She thought she would have the {{spending}} of it, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> the difference now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps; <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> {{absolutely}} {{nothing of the}} world, and her preference for you--for, as {{you say you are}} engaged to her, I presume she has shown a preference--may be a mistake, merely a young girl's romantic idea." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Neither can I, more's the pity; {{nor does}} Whipple's woman savve the lingo. I {{got it from}} her.

50|$|This poem also {{discusses}} {{the concept of}} money. During this time in history, those who had wealth were considered important in society. Amelia has money <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> that <b>she</b> had to sacrifice much {{in order to get}} the money.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a whit. She laughed, {{and said}} she was in jest," [...] {{answered}} Jenkin; [...] "but I know the she-devil's jest from her earnest too well to be taken in that way. <b>But</b> <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> I would never betray her.' ...|$|R

50|$|Odile is restless {{because her}} father seldom praises her, even though (or perhaps because) she is growing {{to be his}} equal in magic.
