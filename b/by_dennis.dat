5|$|Des McAnuff {{replaced}} Mann as director, and filming was {{rescheduled to}} December 1994. Screenwriter Horovitz was busy playwrighting in Europe, so McAnuff and producer Marvin Worth were constantly rewriting the script in July 1994. The budget {{was estimated at}} $20 million. McAnuff stepped down as director and was replaced <b>by</b> <b>Dennis</b> Hopper. Hopper {{was a close friend}} with Dean and co-starred with the actor in both Rebel Without a Cause and Giant. Hopper met with DiCaprio for the lead role, but the director eventually dropped out of the film. By May 1995, DiCaprio was still the top candidate to portray Dean with Milčo Mančevski in discussions to direct the film.|$|E
5|$|Species is a 1995 American {{science fiction}} horror film {{directed}} by Roger Donaldson and written <b>by</b> <b>Dennis</b> Feldman. It stars Natasha Henstridge (in her debut film role), Ben Kingsley, Michael Madsen, Alfred Molina, Forest Whitaker and Marg Helgenberger. In the film, a motley crew {{of scientists and}} government agents tries to track down a seductive alien played by Henstridge before she successfully mates with a human male. Due to her ruthlessness, the alien character was cited {{as an example of}} negative treatment of female sexuality and aliens by Hollywood. The design of Sil was also linked to a chupacabra sighting.|$|E
5|$|Werder Bremen were next {{up in the}} quarter-finals. Goals apiece by Thierry Henry and Fredrik Ljungberg {{helped them}} to a 2–0 victory at home.

5|$|When Indiana {{became a}} state in 1816, the capital was located in Corydon. The first capitol {{building}} was a humble, two-story limestone building constructed in 1813 to house the legislature of the Indiana Territory. The building was constructed by a company owned <b>by</b> <b>Dennis</b> Pennington, {{a member of the}} early territorial legislature. Construction cost $1,500, paid for by the citizens of Harrison County, and was completed in three years. It measured forty-feet square with walls two-feet-thick and ten-foot ceilings. The building was made of limestone cut from a nearby quarry and, {{at the time of its}} completion, was one of the largest buildings in the state.|$|E
5|$|Although the collector's pieces sold well, the new dollars {{failed to}} {{circulate}} to any degree, except {{in and around}} Nevada casinos, where they took the place of privately issued tokens. There are no dollars dated 1975; coins from that year and from 1976 bear a double date 1776–1976, and a special reverse <b>by</b> <b>Dennis</b> R. Williams {{in honor of the}} bicentennial of American independence. Beginning in 1977, the Mint sought to replace the Eisenhower dollar with a smaller-sized piece. Congress authorized the Susan B. Anthony dollar, struck beginning in 1979, but that piece also failed to circulate. Due to their modest cost and the short length of the series, sets of Eisenhower dollars are becoming more popular among collectors.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{qualified}} for the 2002 FA Community Shield as the holders of the FA Cup, beating Chelsea 2–0 in the 2002 FA Cup Final. The team later won the 2001–02 FA Premier League and completed the domestic double. The other Community Shield place went to league runners-up Liverpool, who secured second place {{on the final day}} of the season. The game marked Arsenal's 16th Charity Shield appearance and first since 1999, where they beat Manchester United by two goals to one. By contrast this was Liverpool's 20th, who incidentally played United and won by exactly the same scoreline to become holders of the trophy. The last meeting between the two teams was in the FA Cup; a goal <b>by</b> <b>Dennis</b> Bergkamp ensured Arsenal progressed into the fifth round of the competition.|$|E

5|$|As Thompson began porting {{the game}} to the new system, {{he decided not to}} base the code on any of the {{existing}} software for the computer, and instead write his own. As a result, he implemented his own base code libraries for programs to use, including arithmetic packages and graphics subsystems. These initial subsystems were coded in assembly language on the GECOS system and assembled, then the output physically put on punched tapes to be carried over and inserted into the PDP-7. Thompson then wrote an assembler for the PDP-7 to avoid this laborious process. The game ran very slowly on the new machine, causing Thompson to branch out from there to design his own file system based on some ideas <b>by</b> <b>Dennis</b> Ritchie and Rudd Canaday, rooted in their experience with the Multics file system, with which he then ran Space Travel.|$|E

5|$|Friedman {{spent the}} 1954–1955 {{academic}} {{year as a}} Fulbright Visiting Fellow at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. At the time, the Cambridge economics faculty was divided into a Keynesian majority (including Joan Robinson and Richard Kahn) and an anti-Keynesian minority (headed <b>by</b> <b>Dennis</b> Robertson). Friedman speculated that {{he was invited to}} the fellowship, because his views were unacceptable to both of the Cambridge factions. Later his weekly columns for Newsweek magazine (1966–84) were well read and increasingly influential among political and business people. From 1968 to 1978, he and Paul Samuelson participated in the Economics Cassette Series, a biweekly subscription series where the economist would discuss the days' issues for about a half-hour at a time.|$|E
