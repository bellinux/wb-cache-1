Ever since, novel impacts to regional farming, biodiversity conservation and public health have recurrently been associated to vole outbreaks. Here we present the first attempt to reconstruct recent changes of common vole dynamics and distribution in the NW of the Iberian Peninsula. We compile published information for the last 50 years and describe a new methodological approach based on semi-quantitative data obtained from complementary sources. Our results show how, from late- 1970 s, the entire lowland plains of Castilla y León region were rapidly (< 20 years) filled in by expanding populations. Analyses of outbreaks also suggest a 5 -year cyclic pattern from late- 1970 s onwards, contrasting with the typical 3 -year cycle described in most populations of this species. Our results contribute to improve the current knowledge of rodent dynamics in Europe and {{may serve as a}} baseline to local pest management programmes...|$|E
40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado al 11 th International Mammalogical Congress, celebrado en Belfast (Irlanda) del 11 al 16 de agosto de 2013. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>last</b> {{century the}} {{distribution}} range of Microtus arvalis in NW Spain greatly expanded to encompass agricultural lowlands (ca. 5 million ha), {{followed by the}} appearance of regular crop-damaging population outbreaks. We investigated plausible causal factors and found a strong association between an increase in irrigated crop surface and vole expansion, suggesting that colonization of (dry) lowlands from (humid) mountains was mainly due to recent changes in land uses. Evaluation of NDVI (greenness) patterns confirms this prediction. We also found that outbreaks tend to occur in years with high summer/autumn greenness pattern, which is mainly determined by spring rainfall. Thus, the 5 -year period detected for the occurrence of vole outbreaks at regional level could be the result of a periodicity in above spring rainfall. Colonization of lowlands by common voles has strongly influenced structure and functioning of ecological communities, including the recorded decline of endemic Mediterranean voles.

40|$|A current {{trend in}} {{neuroscience}} {{research is the}} use of stable isotope tracers in order to address metabolic processes in vivo. The tracers produce a huge number of metabolite forms that differ according to the number and position of labeled isotopes in the carbon skeleton (isotopomers) and such a large variety makes the analysis of isotopomer data highly complex. On the other hand, this multiplicity of forms does provide sufficient information to address cell operation in vivo. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>last</b> millennium, a number of tools have been developed for estimation of metabolic flux profile from any possible isotopomer distribution data. However, although well elaborated, these tools were limited to steady state analysis, and the obtained set of fluxes remained disconnected from their biochemical context. In this review we focus on a new numerical analytical approach that integrates kinetic and metabolic flux analysis. The related computational algorithm estimates the dynamic flux based on the time-dependent distribution of all possible isotopomers of metabolic pathway intermediates that are generated from a labeled substrate. The new algorithm connects specific tracer data with enzyme kinetic characteristics, thereby extending the amount of data available for analysis: it uses enzyme kinetic data to estimate the flux profile, and vice versa, for the kinetic analysis it uses in vivo tracer data to reveal the biochemical basis of the estimated metabolic fluxes...|$|E

On May 1, Greece {{agreed to a}} series of austerity measures that convinced the previously reluctant Germany to support a bailout package for Europe but also set off massive strikes throughout Greece.

Even this news did not prevent stock market drops worldwide. Spain too lost its AAA credit rating at the end of May, further fanning fears that the crisis could spread to the rest of Europe. Unfortunately, Greece faces two major obstacles to taking a truly proactive approach to recovering productivity. First, {{as a member of the}} Eurozone, which takes monetary policy out of national hands, Greece is unable to use monetary and fiscal measures in ways traditionally applied in such a situation. Second, this structural difficulty has been further exacerbated by the prevailing ideological approach to the European debt crisis, which has been framed in terms of restoring international creditworthiness and protecting foreign creditors, rather than in terms of ensuring employment and basic social needs for citizens...|$|E
