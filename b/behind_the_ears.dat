5|$|Slender {{with thin}} legs {{and a short}} tail, the four-horned {{antelope}} has a yellowish brown to reddish coat. The underparts and the insides of the legs are white. Facial features include black markings on the muzzle and <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>ears.</b> A black stripe marks the outer surface of each leg. Females have four teats far back on the abdomen. The hair feels coarse, more {{like that of a}} deer than the glossy hair typical of antelopes. The fetlocks are marked with white patches.|$|E
5|$|The caracal {{is often}} {{confused}} with the lynx, as both cats have tufted ears. However, a notable point of {{difference between the two}} is that the lynx is spotted and blotched, while the caracal shows no such markings on the coat. The African golden cat has a similar build as the caracal's, but is darker and lacks the ear tufts. The sympatric serval can be told apart from the caracal by the former's lack of ear tufts, white spots <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>ears,</b> spotted coat, longer legs, longer tail and smaller footprints.|$|E
40|$|A {{rare case}} of {{cochlear}} implant surgery complication is described: air collection <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear.</b> A 61 -year-old male with a 20 -year history of progressive bilateral profound {{sensorineural hearing loss}} underwent cochlear implant surgery on <b>the</b> left <b>ear</b> with Clarion Hi-Res 90 K (Advanced Bionics, Sylmar, CA, USA). Ten days after surgery, the patient presented visible tumefaction <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> corresponding to <b>the</b> receiver-stimulator. Ultrasonography, with a probe of 30 MHz, of <b>the</b> surface <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> showed formation of probable liquid content but aspiration with a 20 -gauge needle yielded 30 cm 3 of air without blood or pus. An unusual case is described of a minor complication occurring in an adult cochlear implant patient presenting a swelling <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> that {{was found to be}} collected air. Although ultrasonography can be useful to evaluate localization of swelling <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> and to differentiate between liquid and solid collection, it is not useful for identification of air collection. The Eustachian tube test can show an abnormally patent tube and prevent this complication...|$|R

5|$|Amphibian skin is {{permeable}} to water. Gas exchange {{can take}} place through the skin (cutaneous respiration) and this allows adult amphibians to respire without rising {{to the surface of}} water and to hibernate at the bottom of ponds. To compensate for their thin and delicate skin, amphibians have evolved mucous glands, principally on their heads, backs and tails. The secretions produced by these help keep the skin moist. In addition, most species of amphibian have granular glands that secrete distasteful or poisonous substances. Some amphibian toxins can be lethal to humans while others have little effect. The main poison-producing glands, the paratoids, produce the neurotoxin bufotoxin and are located <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>ears</b> of toads, along the backs of frogs, behind the eyes of salamanders and on the upper surface of caecilians.|$|E
5|$|The {{panel is}} the {{smallest}} extant work by van der Weyden and follows the tradition of a Madonna Lactans, with significant differences. Christ {{is dressed in a}} red garment, as opposed to the swaddling he usually wears in 15th-century Virgin and Child portrayals. This is one of two exceptions where he is fully clothed; the other is Robert Campin's Madonna in Frankfurt, where he is shown in blue clothing. Mary's unbound blond hair falls across her shoulders and down across her arms. Showing the influence of Campin, it is brushed <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>ears.</b> She wears a crown as Queen of Heaven and a ring on a finger as the Bride of Christ. Reinforcing this, the blue colour of her robe alludes to her devotion and fidelity to her son. The folds of her dress are reminiscent of the lengthy, crisp, curved intertwined gowns of Gothic sculpture.|$|E

40|$|Background: Here, we {{introduce}} {{our recent}} operative technique for ear elevation {{that results in}} (1) minimal morbidity for patients, (2) symmetric appearance, (3) clearer 3 -dimensional structure with a deep concha, (4) good aesthetic appearance by hiding <b>the</b> grafted area <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear,</b> and (5) maintenance of deep temporoauricular sulcus and angle. Methods: After a skin incision, <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> is elevated with temporoparietal fascia underlying the cartilage. On the conchal area, undermining is performed just below the skin so that the deep concavity can be maintained. Scalp and neck skin <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> is undermined subcutaneously and lifted up cranially to hide the entire area of grafted skin <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear.</b> <b>The</b> postauricular surface is covered by full-thickness skin from the lower abdomen. A protective splint is applied for 3 months while sleeping. Results: A total of 137 ears in 121 patients were corrected with our technique and followed up for at least 3 years. All of the scar tissue could be hidden <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear,</b> an aesthetically excellent result. Conclusions: Our technique {{made it possible to}} acquire an excellent and symmetrical shape of <b>the</b> <b>ear.</b> <b>The</b> important points in our procedure are as follows: (1) subcutaneous posterior undermining to enlarge the conchal cavity, (2) careful arrangement of the temporoauricular angle and auriculo-earlobe angle, (3) reduction in the area of temporally grafted skin to hide all scars <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear,</b> and (4) protection of <b>the</b> <b>ear</b> to maintain <b>the</b> shape using a postoperative splint...|$|R

25|$|This statue to {{the right}} speaks well for the {{equality}} of gender in ancient Egypt that a private lady could have a sculpture made for herself. The heavy tripartite wig frames the broad face and passes <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>ears,</b> thus giving the impression of forcing them forward. They are large {{in keeping with the}} ancient Egyptian ideal of beauty; the same ideal required small breasts, and also in this respect the sculpture is no exception. Whereas the natural curve of the eyebrows dips towards the root of the nose, the artificial eyebrows in low relief are absolutely straight above the inner corners of the eyes, a feature which places the bust early in Dynasty XII. Around 1900 B.C. these artificial eyebrows, too, began to follow the natural curve and dipped toward the nose.|$|E
25|$|Cohn {{also points}} out that while the {{identification}} of the disease as having buboes relies on accounts of Boccaccio and others, they described buboes, abscesses, rashes and carbuncles occurring all over the body, the neck or <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>ears.</b> In contrast, the modern disease rarely has more than one bubo, most commonly in the groin, and is not characterised by abscesses, rashes and carbuncles. This difference, he argues, ties in with the fact that fleas caused the modern plague and not the Black Death. Since flea bites do not usually reach beyond a person's ankles, in the modern period the groin was the nearest lymph node that could be infected. As the neck and the armpit were often infected during the medieval plague, it appears less likely that these infections were caused by fleas on rats.|$|E

25|$|The {{conventional}} {{application of}} pure perfume (parfum extrait) in Western cultures is at pulse points, such as <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>ears,</b> {{the nape of}} the neck, and the insides of wrists, elbows and knees, so that the pulse point will warm the perfume and release fragrance continuously. According to perfumer Sophia Grojsman behind the knees is the ideal point to apply perfume in order that the scent may rise. The modern perfume industry encourages the practice of layering fragrance {{so that it is}} released in different intensities depending upon the time of the day. Lightly scented products such as bath oil, shower gel, and body lotion are recommended for the morning; eau de toilette is suggested for the afternoon; and perfume applied to the pulse points for evening. Cologne fragrance is released rapidly, lasting around 2 hours. Eau de toilette lasts from 2 to 4 hours, while perfume may last up to six hours.|$|E
25|$|The forbidding of shaving {{the corners}} of the head was {{interpreted}} by the Mishnah as prohibiting the hair at the temples being cut so that the hairline was a straight line from <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>ears</b> to the forehead; thus it was deemed necessary to retain sidelocks, leading {{to the development of a}} distinctly Jewish form of sidelock, known as payot. As for the beard, more complicated views arose; {{the corners of}} the beard were explained to refer to five extremities in the Talmud. There are many opinions in mediaeval scholars as to what these five points are. For example, it may be a point on each cheek near the temples, a point at the end of the cheek bone towards the centre of the face, and the point of the chin. Or it may be 2 on the mustache, 2 somewhere on the cheek and one on the point on the chin. As a result, Shulchan Aruch prohibits the shaving of the entire beard and mustache.|$|E
500|$|... 1880: French {{neurologist}} Désiré-Magloire Bourneville had {{a chance}} encounter with the disease that would bear his name. He was working as an unofficial assistant to Jean Martin Charcot at La Salpêtrière. While substituting for his teacher, Louis J.F. Delasiauve, he attended to Marie, a 15-year-old girl with psychomotor retardation, epilepsy and a [...] "confluent vascular-papulous eruption of the nose, the cheeks and forehead". She {{had a history of}} seizures since infancy and was taken to the children's hospital aged three and declared a hopeless case. She had learning difficulties and could neither walk nor talk. While under Bourneville's care, Marie had an ever-increasing number of seizures, which came in clusters. She was treated with quinquina, bromide of camphor, amyl nitrite, and the application of leeches <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>ears.</b> On 7 May 1879 Marie died in her hospital bed. The post-mortem examination disclosed hard, dense tubers in the cerebral convolutions, which Bourneville named Sclérose tubéreuse des circonvolutions cérébrales. He concluded they were the source (focus) of her seizures. In addition, whitish hard masses, one [...] "the size of a walnut", were found in both kidneys.|$|E
