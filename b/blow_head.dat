50|$|Some dead blow hammers have {{completely}} solid heads, usually made of rubber or resilient plastic (such as ultra {{high molecular weight}} plastic, UHMW), and rely on the inherent properties of the material to absorb shock and reduce rebound. Commonly constructed of polyurethane, dead blow hammers regularly appear in solid orange or black. Composite heads and fiberglass handle models are also available, with optional shock-absorbent rubber grips. A variant design omits the handle entirely; the dead <b>blow</b> <b>head</b> is gripped directly in the hand, for use in tight locations.|$|E
40|$|Granular {{boom sprayer}} {{has been used}} by large scaled farmers for centuries. This machine is used to repel or {{fertilize}} their crops. In MARDI, they used 3 types of fertilizer that is Nitrogen, N, Phosphorus, P and Potassium, K. Those 3 types of particles have been simulated by using Ansys software and the results show that potassium, K fertilizer not scattered to the ground and the others 2 fertilizers are conversely. The uniformity of the distribution of granular fertilizer was carried out with a reasonable range of variables. Various methods have been used to study the efficiency of the spray boom design on through simulation software and lab approach. In this work, the simulation of the particles in the boom sprayer is performed from the boom sprayer entering until the exit and distributed to the ground. The simulation is performed by using ANSYS CFX based on the Taguchi method. Taguchi method have been used in this study. For the orthogonal array, since this case study consists of 4 level and 5 factor, L‟ 16 was used for the simulation process. This simulation utilize only one fertilizer that contained all types of the basic NPK fertilizer. The parameters are involved the granular diameter size, air velocity at the inlet, <b>blow</b> <b>head</b> distance, height of collecting plate and width of collecting plate. Results shows that the air velocity must be kept higher when the diameter of particle increases. Collecting plates with excessive height and width can cause the velocity fertilizer to drop and the particles fail to distribute well. Furthermore, furthers distance between the boom section can also cause the particles to scattered unevenly onto the ground. The most desired simulation result was achieved with 1. 5 mm diameter particles, air velocity 8 m/s, distance between boom section is 200 mm and height and width of collecting plate is 14 mm and 10 mm. Particle scattered well and the average of the particle at the first exit until last exit of boom section were observed to be evenly distributed...|$|E
5000|$|RPO LB7 (engine code [...] "1") {{was first}} {{introduced}} in 2001 and continued until early-2004. It is a 32-valve design with high-pressure common-rail direct injection and an experimental composite design cylinder head. The most common issue with the LB7 is injector failure, so common that a special policy bulletin was issued (#04039B). Fuel leaked and entered the crankcase, causing oil dilution. Early on, customers came forward complaining of severe overheating, and in some situations, <b>blown</b> <b>head</b> gaskets. Initially GM denied it was a problem, but after being sued by a consumer group, GM relented and included overheating and <b>blown</b> <b>head</b> gaskets as a warranted item.|$|R

40|$|<b>Blows</b> to the <b>head</b> {{and face}} occur {{commonly}} in competition Taekwondo. However, limited {{research has been}} done on <b>head</b> <b>blows,</b> particularly those that may result in concussion in competition Taekwondo. Therefore, {{the purposes of this study}} were to study the incidence and characteristics of <b>head</b> <b>blow</b> and concussion, and, through visual analysis of competition videotapes, to examine the situational and contextual factors surrounding <b>head</b> <b>blows,</b> with a view to making recommendations that might reduce their frequency. A prospective design with direct observation, interview and videotape recording was used. A total of 212 Canadian competitors (139 males and 73 females) participated in this tournament and ranged in age from 14 - 24 years. The incidence of <b>head</b> <b>blows</b> and concussions was 273 and 53 per 1, 000 athlete-exposures, respectively. None of the <b>head</b> <b>blow</b> recipients lost consciousness following impact to the head. Concussions occur more commonly when competitors adopt a closed sparring stance, and use a roundhouse kick. The most frequent site of impact is the temporal region of the head. In conclusion, the incidence of concussion and <b>head</b> <b>blows</b> is high in competition Taekwondo. This could be decreased with improved skill in blocking kicks to the head and face. ...|$|R

50|$|Hydrolock most {{commonly}} occurs in automobiles when driving through floods, either {{where the water}} is above {{the level of the}} air intake or the vehicle's speed is excessive, creating a tall bow wave. A vehicle fitted with a cold air intake mounted low on the vehicle will be especially vulnerable to hydrolocking when being driven through standing water or heavy precipitation. Engine coolant entering the cylinders through various means (such as a <b>blown</b> <b>head</b> gasket) is another common cause. Excessive fuel entering (flooding) one or more cylinders in liquid form due to abnormal operating conditions can also cause hydrolock.|$|R
