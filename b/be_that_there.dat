25|$|If a small, {{discrete}} stock had {{existed in the}} Bay of Biscay, then localized hunting by the Basques {{may have led to}} its over-exploitation and subsequent (near) disappearance there. A third possibility, perhaps the most plausible, would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are (or were) two populations, one in the western North Atlantic and the other in the eastern North Atlantic. Such a view would conform well with the mainly coastal distribution of right whales in the western North Atlantic today. Still, this possibility would result in the harvest of right whales not only in the Bay of Biscay, but in Iceland, Northern Norway, and the rest of Europe, which may have been enough to severely deplete this supposed stock.|$|E
25|$|Information on Kliper's beyond LEO mission {{capabilities}} were expanded {{further by}} RSC Energia, {{with a picture}} released in December 2005 of what a possible Kliper interplanetary configuration might have looked like. The design was entirely theoretical but made for a view of where RSC Energia saw the Kliper operating, and how it might have done so. This configuration was unlike anything seen so far for a manned space vehicle, with the solar arrays needed for electrical power vastly bigger than the habitable volume at the centre. It was also unclear what the mode of propulsion was. The very large solar array suggested an ion propulsion system might have been contemplated for such a mission, though it might also simply <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was another reason for such a large array, such as increased power for better telemetry transmission rates over large distances.|$|E

25|$|Each {{of these}} men participated in {{promoting}} the first settlement of Huguenots at New Rochelle along {{with the assistance of}} Jacob Leisler. An initial purchase of the tract including Davenport Neck and the adjacent island, now Davids'Island, with Leisler securing the largest share. This purchase proved too limited to handle the large number of refugees arriving in New York, thus resulting in the larger purchase of land from John Pell in 1687. No conveyance of the New Rochelle purchase, pursuant to the 1687 contract, was delivered until 1689, and John Pell conveyed it to Jacob Leisler alone, ignoring all others interested in the purchase. The explanation may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> had already developed among the Huguenot refugees considerable hostility to Leisler and opposition to his political activities and ambitions. Many of the prominent settlers of New Rochelle actively opposed Leisler. Minivielle was so hostile that he cast his vote in the Governor's Council in 1691 for Leisler's execution.|$|E
25|$|The Stackelberg and Cournot {{models are}} similar because in both {{competition}} is on quantity. However, as seen, {{the first move}} gives the leader in Stackelberg a crucial advantage. There is also the important assumption of perfect information in the Stackelberg game: the follower must observe the quantity chosen by the leader, otherwise the game reduces to Cournot. With imperfect information, the threats described above can be credible. If the follower cannot observe the leader's move, {{it is no longer}} irrational for the follower to choose, say, a Cournot level of quantity (in fact, that is the equilibrium action). However, it must <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is imperfect information and the follower is unable to observe the leader's move because it is irrational for the follower not to observe if it can once the leader has moved. If it can observe, it will so that it can make the optimal decision. Any threat by the follower claiming that it will not observe even if it can is as uncredible as those above. This is an example of too much information hurting a player. In Cournot competition, it is the simultaneity of the game (the imperfection of knowledge) that results in neither player (ceteris paribus) being at a disadvantage.|$|E
500|$|On the {{difference}} between the obscure and the renowned in the poem, scholar David Cecil argued, [...] "Death, he perceives, dwarfs human differences. There is not much to choose between the great and the humble, once they are in the grave. It may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> never was; it may be that in the obscure graveyard lie those who but for circumstance would have been as famous as Milton and Hampden." [...] However, death is not completely democratic because [...] "if circumstances prevented them from achieving great fame, circumstances also saved them from committing great crimes. Yet there is a special pathos in these obscure tombs; the crude inscriptions on the clumsy monuments are so poignant a reminder of the vain longing of all men, however humble, to be loved and to be remembered." ...|$|E

500|$|Noting the {{large-scale}} Mexican {{immigration to the}} Southwestern United States, Kennan said in 2002 there were [...] "unmistakable evidences of a growing differentiation between the cultures, respectively, of large southern and southwestern regions of this country, on the one hand", and those of [...] "some northern regions".

[...] Thompson called the game subtle, including jabs at the participants and gaming culture by using the language of games {{as a way to}} think about the killings. Writing for The Courier Mail, Paul Syvret's advice to those who found the game controversial and in bad taste was to [...] "lighten up". Bogost summed up his review of the game by writing [...] "this game is not fun, it is challenging, and difficult to play—not technically difficult, but conceptually difficult. We need more of that." [...] David Kociemba, a professor at Emerson College, agreed with Bogost and commented that [...] "the controversy should <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> aren't more games like Super Columbine Massacre RPG! that are as demanding and as artistically innovative."

2500|$|Bede {{implies that}} {{in the time of}} Augustine of Canterbury, British churches used a baptismal rite that was in some way at {{variance}} with the Roman practice.

There is no indication as to how the baptism was [...] "incomplete" [...] according to the Roman custom. It may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was some difference in the confirmation rite, or that there was no confirmation at all.

2500|$|Bortkiewicz's {{analysis}} nevertheless {{raised the}} very important {{question of what}} the point of Marx's value theory is. Is there is any real difference between Marx's [...] "values" [...] and theoretical prices? If {{there is no real}} difference, neo-Ricardians argued, then Marx's value theory is redundant; one could then just as well make all the same sorts of arguments in price terms. The advantage seemed to <b>be,</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> exists no [...] "transformation problem" [...] of converting values into prices through a quantitative adjustment anymore, and that value theory could be replaced with equilibrium theory to explain prices, since [...] "value" [...] then simply stood for [...] "equilibrium prices" [...] (such as the Smithian or Ricardian [...] "natural prices"). One could then create a system of equilibrium prices for the critical variables involved in production, to explain price relationships. However, then Marx's theory of the formation of a general rate of profit, and his theory of the TRPF, would no longer be valid.|$|E
2500|$|The name Sørvágur {{translates}} to [...] "The Bay of Sør". While {{the second half}} of the name makes sense given the fact that the village is located at a bay, the first half is more mysterious. Legend has it that the first man to settle at this place was called 'Sørli' and hence the village was named in honour of him. Another explanation on the origin of 'Sør' comes from the old-Norse 'Seyr' which is a word for sand (seyr is also a word for foggy rain). Sørvágur has quite a large sandbeach in comparison with other Faroese villages and towns, and therefore it was speculated that the original name of Sørvágur was Seyrvágur, and during the course of time, Seyrvágur became Sørvágur. During the first half of the 20th century local people in Sørvágur tried to correct this historical injustice and used the name Seyrvágur instead of Sørvágur. However, this trend died out again. One reason may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no proof in the Faroese historical records that justifies the name Seyrvágur.|$|E

[...] Legislatively enacted rules are surely entitled to more respect than this apparent presumption that, when nothing substantial hangs on the point, they do not apply as written." [...] At a minimum, Scalia believed it [...] "a nontrivial value in itself" [...] to [...] "observe the formalities of our adversary system" [...] by requiring the State to amend its own pleading. [...] Scalia also observed that in contrast to the [...] "novel regime" [...] adopted by the majority, there is already a well-developed body of law regarding whether a party should have leave to amend a pleading.

2500|$|A {{report on}} the track {{and its impact on}} traffic delays and {{congestion}} in the City of Glen Eira was presented to the Glen Eira City Council on 22 July 2008 following a meeting between representatives of council and VicRoads on 27 May 2008. VicRoads advised the council that it was unlikely a third track would be installed for the [...] "entire length" [...] of the line. The more likely outcome would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> would be three tracks for some sections and the existing two in others. It said modelling to deal with subsequent road traffic congestion was to be undertaken on three options: Grade separation on (1) none of Glen Eira's roads, (2) all of Glen Eira's roads and (3) some of Glen Eira's roads. The third option would have the effect of channelling further traffic volumes on to any roads that were grade separated from the railway lines. The council concluded that it was not in the interest of VicRoads or the council to have intolerable levels of traffic congestion, and that it expected there would be detailed impact statements prepared, public submissions sought and the range of options examined by an independent panel appointed by the Transport Minister.|$|E
