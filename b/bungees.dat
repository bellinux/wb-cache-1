50|$|<b>Bungee</b> balls were a fad in February 1991 {{and most}} <b>bungee</b> balls were sold {{during this time}} period. After March 2003, they started {{vanishing}} from stores partly due to controversy over what was contained inside them. They were also discontinued in many stores because often after about 4-7 hours of use, the <b>Bungee</b> Ball's <b>bungee</b> cord would snap, and the ball itself would break, releasing synthetic liquid. They were recalled in October 2003. By then, nearly all <b>Bungee</b> Balls had vanished from retail stores. <b>Bungee</b> Balls are now most available by online shopping.|$|R

50|$|The use of <b>bungees</b> for upper {{cylinder}} attachment and trim is a quintessential identifier of sidemount configuration. The bungee {{is attached to}} the rear upper harness/BCD and routes under the diver's armpits to the front shoulder webbing. Appropriate length and thickness <b>bungees</b> are critical to ensure that the sidemount cylinders remain in trim horizontally along the diver's side torso with the valves under the armpits. The cylinder/s should neither rise above, or drop below, the diver when they are in flat, horizontal trim position. The cylinder is secured by wrapping, or routing, the <b>bungees</b> around the cylinder valve handle, stem and/or cylinder neck. In addition to providing the desired cylinder positioning and trim, the <b>bungees</b> also provide the capacity to secure the cylinder top end to the diver while the cylinders are detached at the bottom and maneuvered into a forward position.|$|E

50|$|A <b>bungee</b> {{chair is}} a chair that has <b>bungee</b> cords or bands {{incorporated}} in its construction.

50|$|A <b>bungee</b> {{trampoline}} (also {{known as}} a bungy trampoline) is an attraction at many fairs, vacation resorts and several summer camps. There are many different designs of <b>bungee</b> trampolines, but most operate in the same fashion. The participant puts on a <b>bungee</b> trampoline harness and is then hooked to several <b>bungee</b> ropes. Those ropes are attached to poles or bars reaching an average of fifteen feet above the trampoline platform. As the participant jumps higher and higher the <b>bungee</b> ropes are moved up the poles allowing the participant to reach heights and do flips and other maneuvers {{that would otherwise be}} impossible on a regular trampoline.|$|R
5000|$|In another June 2016 flight review, Paul Bertorelli of AVweb said, [...] "The XCub has {{aluminum}} {{rather than}} steel or the Cub’s traditional bungee gear. This {{was a revelation}} for me because aluminum does a nice job of absorbing surplus touchdown energy; it’s far less energetic than steel or those blasted <b>bungees</b> in returning misdirected touchdown energy. This results in a unique feeling on touchdown. If you know you’re a little fast and you know you’re going to bounce, it’s just a small one and not the sharp-edged twang of steel or the slingshot of the <b>bungees,</b> but rather a firm pushback with no lateral wiggles at all. It’s quite confidence inducing because those small bounces don’t require the massive control inputs to arrest that a really bad spring-steel bounce would." ...|$|E

50|$|Silt screws are pegs {{which are}} {{inserted}} into soft bottom sediments to tie off the guide line {{when there are}} no suitable natural formations. A common style of silt screw is a length of rigid PVC tube cut to a point at one end, with a notch at the other to secure a wrap. These are lightweight and durable, and are easily transported by attaching them to a cylinder with <b>bungees.</b>|$|E
50|$|Continuous Bungee: This is {{a single}} length of <b>bungee</b> cord, routed from one {{shoulder}} D-ring to the other, via {{the rear of the}} diver and under the armpits.

5000|$|<b>Bungee</b> {{launch control}} systems for kited hang gliders {{has its own}} special details. The tug kite line is very elastic; when tensed, the line is long; during use for launch, the kite line shortens. Controlling the kite's wing attitudes {{is up to the}} piilot who {{frequently}} is hung from a short kite line while controlling a triangle control frame or other airframe part or even aerodynamic surface controls. Professional instruction is highly recommended. Inelastic portion of the <b>bungee</b> assembly is used to help guard against what can happen if the <b>bungee</b> breaks and snaps back toward the pilot; a tug-line parachute can be used to lower the speed that the released <b>bungee</b> will fall. <b>Bungee</b> launch is used most frequently for launch off slopes when free-foot-launch is not easy (site structure or pilots who have not the use of their legs), or for flatland short-flight demonstrations.
