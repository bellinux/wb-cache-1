5|$|Fishers have <b>been</b> <b>trapped</b> {{since the}} 18th century. They have been popular with trappers {{due to the}} value of their fur, which has been used for scarves and neck pieces. The best pelts are from winter {{trapping}} with secondary quality pelts from spring trapping. The lowest-quality furs come from out-of-season trapping when fishers are moulting. They are easily trapped, and the value of their fur was a particular incentive for catching this species.|$|E
5|$|Fishers {{have few}} predators besides humans. They have <b>been</b> <b>trapped</b> since the 18th century for their fur. Their pelts were in such demand {{that they were}} extirpated from several parts of the United States {{in the early part}} of the 20th century. Conservation and {{protection}} measures have allowed the species to rebound, but their current range is still reduced from its historic limits. In the 1920s, when pelt prices were high, some fur farmers attempted to raise fishers. However, their unusual delayed reproduction made breeding difficult. When pelt prices fell in the late 1940s, most fisher farming ended. While fishers usually avoid human contact, encroachments into forest habitats have resulted in some conflicts.|$|E
5|$|Ganteaume's expeditions of 1801 {{were three}} {{connected}} major French Navy {{operations of the}} spring of 1801 during the French Revolutionary Wars. A French naval squadron from Brest under Contre-amiral Honoré Ganteaume, seeking to reinforce the besieged French garrison in Egypt, made three separate but futile efforts to reach the Eastern Mediterranean. The French army in Egypt had <b>been</b> <b>trapped</b> there shortly {{after the start of}} the Napoleonic campaign in Egypt in 1798, when the French Mediterranean Fleet was destroyed at the Battle of the Nile. Since that defeat, the French Navy had maintained only a minimal presence in the Mediterranean Sea, while the more numerous British and their allies had succeeded in blockading and defeating several French bases almost unopposed.|$|E

Likewise, a pawn that reaches the far rank <b>is</b> <b>trapped,</b> as <b>is</b> a knight which captures there. A lance <b>is</b> also <b>trapped</b> at the far rank, but can escape if it captures there and thus demotes to a silver. A silver which captures in the far rank and therefore promotes to a lance <b>is</b> <b>trapped.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cass Cave is a cave {{located in}} Cass, West Virginia, on Cheat Mountain. On March 16, 1968, 8 people <b>were</b> <b>trapped</b> and later rescued {{in the cave}}.

5|$|It may {{always have}} been thinly spread, {{but there has been}} {{widespread}} deforestation within its range resulting in loss and fragmentation of suitable habitat. The rail has been protected under Indonesian law since 1972, and the large Lore Lindu and Bogani Nani Wartabone National Parks are within its range, but logging and rattan cutting occurs even in these protected areas, and human encroachment is also a problem at Lore Lindu. The rail has <b>been</b> <b>trapped</b> for food in the past, and is sometimes killed by dogs, cats and other introduced predators. A 2007 survey of protected areas of Sulawesi failed to find the rail, suggesting that it is genuinely rare even in reserves.|$|E
5|$|Judy (1936 – 17 February 1950) was a ship's dog {{on board}} HMS Gnat and HMS Grasshopper {{stationed}} on the Yangtze {{before and during}} World War II. She proved able to hear incoming aircraft, providing the crew with an early warning. After part of the crew transferred from the Gnat to the Grasshopper in June 1939 the ship was sent to Singapore after the British declaration of war on Germany. There she was on board the ship during the Battle of Singapore, which saw Grasshopper evacuate for the Dutch East Indies. It was sunk en route, and Judy was nearly killed having <b>been</b> <b>trapped</b> by a falling row of lockers. She was rescued when a crewman returned to the stricken vessel looking for supplies.|$|E

5|$|Within the Solar System, the nucleon {{fraction}} of xenon is , for {{an abundance of}} approximately one part in 630thousand of the total mass. Xenon is relatively rare in the Sun's atmosphere, on Earth, and in asteroids and comets. The abundance of xenon in the atmosphere of planet Jupiter is unusually high, about 2.6 {{times that of the}} Sun. This abundance remains unexplained, but may have been caused by an early and rapid buildup of planetesimals—small, subplanetary bodies—before the heating of the presolar disk. (Otherwise, xenon would not have <b>been</b> <b>trapped</b> in the planetesimal ices.) The problem of the low terrestrial xenon may be explained by covalent bonding of xenon to oxygen within quartz, reducing the outgassing of xenon into the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Bruce {{decides to}} reveal his secret identity. Before he can, however, Dent announces that he is Batman. Dent is taken into {{protective}} custody, but the Joker appears and attacks the convoy. Batman comes to Dent's rescue and Gordon, who faked his death, apprehends the Joker, securing a promotion to Commissioner. Rachel and Dent are escorted away by Michael Wuertz and Anna Ramirez, detectives on Maroni's payroll; Gordon later learns that they never arrived home.

5|$|In Arnhem {{at around}} 03:30, the leading units of 11 Para reached 1st Parachute Brigade and the 2nd South Staffords, {{just as they}} started a new attempt to fight through to the bridge. As the {{battalion}} had just arrived and had no appreciation of the ground, it was held in reserve and played no part in the attack. By dawn and under intense fire, the attack faltered and 11 Para were ordered {{to carry out a}} left flanking attack to relieve the pressure on the South Staffords. Only the intervention of Major-General Urquhart, just freed from where he had <b>been</b> <b>trapped,</b> stopped the 11 Para assault. Having recognised the futility of the battle Urquhart was not prepared to reinforce failure. At 11:00 the Major-General ordered 11 Para still in the outskirts of Arnhem to support the advance of 4th Parachute Brigade by occupying the high ground on the north-west outskirts of Arnhem. At 14:30 the battalion was caught in the open and subjected to a mortar attack. The attacked caused heavy casualties including the commanding officer lieutenant-Colonel George Lea, unable to proceed around 150 of the survivors were forced to withdraw towards Oosterbeek.|$|E

5|$|It {{is thought}} that these plants that have evolved protocarnivorous habits {{typically}} reside in habitats {{where there is a}} significant nutrient deficiency, but not the severe deficiency in nitrogen and phosphorus seen where true carnivorous plants grow. The function of the protocarnivorous habit, however, need not be directly related to lack of nutrient access. Some classic protocarnivorous plants represent convergent evolution in form but not necessarily in function. Plumbago, for example, possesses glandular trichomes on its calyces that structurally resemble the tentacles of Drosera and Drosophyllum. The function of the Plumbago tentacles is, however, disputed. Some contend that their function is to aid in pollination, adhering seeds to visiting pollinators. Others note that on some species (Plumbago auriculata), small, crawling insects have <b>been</b> <b>trapped</b> in the Plumbagos mucilage, which supports the conclusion that these tentacles could have evolved to exclude crawling insects and favor flying pollinators for greater seed dispersal or perhaps for protection against crawling insect predators.|$|E
5|$|McGann {{was cast}} as Walter Golic to appear with Ralph Brown, his co-star in Withnail and I. Alien 3 Assembly Cut expands on Golic's part in Alien 3, with Golic persuading Morse to unstrap {{him in the}} {{infirmary}} when he hears that the Alien has <b>been</b> <b>trapped.</b> He knocks Morse out, goes to the containment chamber containing the Alien, kills Arthur (who is guarding the door) and releases the creature—which promptly kills him. In an August 1992 Elle magazine article, McGann said that Golic intends to release the Alien {{in the hope that}} he can collaborate with it to kill the humans on Fury 161. Alien 3 editor Terry Rawlings said in the 2003 special-edition DVD release of the Alien Anthology that a parallel exists between Golic and Renfield in Dracula; both are deranged lunatics, who fall under the influence of a paranormal entity which they try to appease.|$|E
5|$|On the {{following}} loop, Crusher again has {{a feeling of}} déjà vu during the poker game, but when Data deals the next hand, all the cards are threes, followed by a hand where all players have three of a kind. The number 3 begins appearing throughout {{other parts of the}} ship's operations while, again, they determine they are stuck in a time loop. When they reach the anomaly and the ship appears from it, Data suddenly realizes that the 3 stands for the number of command pips on Riker's uniform, and executes Riker's option instead of his own. This allows Enterprise to safely clear the oncoming ship. The anomaly disappears and the time loop ends, and the crew realize they have <b>been</b> <b>trapped</b> in the loop for over 17 days, while the other ship, the USS Bozeman, has been missing for over 90 years.

5|$|There was {{a single}} fatality, 31-year-old Mosotho man Leshomo Makhaola, who died when a wall of an old mining house {{collapsed}} on him in Kanana, North West. An ER24 spokesperson said that miners had reportedly <b>been</b> <b>trapped</b> in 11 mine shafts at a mine in Orkney; however, subsequent inspections revealed that the miners at that location were safe. All 3,300 AngloGold Ashanti miners underground at its Great Noligwa and Moab Khotsong mines near Orkney {{had been brought to}} the surface by 19:30 SAST on 5August, including 34 who had been injured. All 34 miners were treated for minor injuries, including lacerations, contusions and a broken leg, and discharged from hospital on 6August. AngloGold Ashanti management had proceeded with the evacuation after their temporarily interrupted power supply was mostly restored, mine management had contacted the mine crew underground by telephone and mine engineers had ensured that the shaft infrastructure was in working order. AngloGold Ashanti emergency medical staff had treated injured miners, and counsellors had treated some employees for shock. Mining operations at their Great Noligwa and Moab Khotsong mines were subsequently suspended pending safety checks.|$|E
5|$|As {{day three}} dawned, the Staffords, and the 1st Parachute Battalion {{attacked}} at 04:00, their first objective being {{to link up}} with the 3rd Parachute Battalion trapped around St Elizabeth's Hospital. The attack failed but allowed Major-General Urquhart to rejoin the division from {{a position where he}} had <b>been</b> <b>trapped</b> by the Germans. This allowed Brigadier Hicks to resume command of the brigade, whereupon Urquhart dispatched Colonel Barlow to take over command of 1st Parachute Brigade and co-ordinate the attack in Arnhem. He left in a jeep and was killed in a mortar barrage just outside Arnhem. The 1st Airlanding Brigade, still holding landing zone 'L' for the expected Polish and resupply gliders, then came under attack from the west and north-west. During the night the KOSB had tried to take the high ground at Koepel, but were stopped by heavy machine gun fire and instead dug in. The remainder of 4th Parachute Brigade advancing north of the railway line also encountered a strong German defence line and were unable to progress any further. All three battalions were ordered to withdraw south of the railway line towards Wolfheze. Although the northern most battalion of the KOSB had thus far enjoyed a quiet morning, in the two hours it took them to advance south of the railway, two companies were now cut off and the entire battalion transport lost. Still under fire from the pursuing Germans, the battalions crossed landing zone 'L' just as the third lift gliders were landing. While attempting to unload the gliders the Poles came under fire. Assuming the approaching men were Germans, they opened fire and caused some casualties.|$|E
5|$|For {{extraordinary}} heroism {{while serving}} as a Leader of a Machine-Gun Section, Company C, 1st Battalion, 27th Marines, 5th Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces on Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands, 19 February 1945. Shrewdly gauging the tactical situation shortly after landing when his company's advance was held up by the concentrated fire of a heavily fortified Japanese blockhouse, Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE boldly defied the smashing bombardment of heavy caliber fire to work {{his way around the}} flank and up to a position directly on top of the blockhouse and then, attacking with grenades and demolitions, single handedly destroyed the entire hostile strong point and its defending garrison. Consistently daring and aggressive as he fought his way over the battle-torn beach and up the sloping, gun-studded terraces toward Airfield Number 1, he repeatedly exposed himself to the blasting fury of exploding shells and later in the day coolly proceeded to the aid of a friendly tank which had <b>been</b> <b>trapped</b> in an enemy mine field under intense mortar and artillery barrages, skillfully guiding the heavy vehicle over the hazardous terrain to safety, despite the overwhelming volume of hostile fire. In the forefront of the assault at all times, he pushed forward with dauntless courage and iron determination until, moving upon the edge of the airfield, he fell, instantly killed by a bursting mortar shell. Stouthearted and indomitable, Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE, by his intrepid initiative, outstanding skill, and valiant spirit of self-sacrifice {{in the face of the}} fanatic opposition, contributed materially to the advance of his company during the early critical period of the assault, and his unwavering devotion to duty throughout the bitter conflict was an inspiration to his comrades and reflects the highest credit upon Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE and the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life in the service of his country.|$|E
