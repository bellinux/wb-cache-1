He {{believes}} himself {{to be one of the}} greatest chessplayers in the world, and thinks that if everything had gone on to his liking he could have beaten all the champions at the tournament. He is a deliberate player, <b>but</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then he takes a nip from a flask of brandy that generally stands on his table. He complained that his chair was too low, and he once attributed a defeat to that. Finally, he got a large ledger and sat upon it. He did, in fact, seem to derive some inspiration from its contents, for he played two or three excellent games afterward.|$|E
25|$|Brigham Young formalized and anointed these assassins as the Danites, {{whose mission}} {{included}} espionage, suppression of information, and quietly, permanently disposing {{of people who}} threatened the Mormon prophet or the Latter-day Saint organization. Again, not many Mormons know this detail of Church history, <b>but</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then, Utah papers record murders with uniquely Mormon flavoring (death by temple-sanctioned methods, for example), and the word that goes out on the Latter-day grapevine is Danite.|$|E
2500|$|After {{violence}} at the Coronado and Emmet Mines in Leadville killed four strikers and one fireman, Smith {{wrote to a}} London business contact, [...] "The strikers got {{the worst of it}} in the raid on the Coronado and Emmet, there were 10 or 12 killed; {{we do not know how}} many, and a great number wounded; they take care of their wounded the same as the Indians <b>but</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then a fellow turns up that the rats have been eating or who has gone to decay that we know must have been shot..." [...] Philpott concluded the remarks suggest [...] "that Smith looked on the miners as almost subhuman. Certainly there is no hint of empathy in these words." ...|$|E

25|$|Although mostly nocturnal, {{they are}} {{occasionally}} active during the day. However, like deer, bongos may exhibit crepuscular behaviour. Bongos are both timid and easily frightened; after a scare, a bongo moves away at considerable speed, even through dense undergrowth. Once they find cover, they stay alert and face {{away from the}} disturbance, <b>but</b> peek <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then to check the situation. The bongo's hindquarters are less conspicuous than the forequarters, and from this position the animal can quickly flee.|$|R
60|$|Just {{then he came}} to a bridge, {{over the}} wall of which leaned an old man with a long white beard, looking down into the water. He was dressed richly <b>but</b> soberly, <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then he sighed and groaned, and as the prince drew near he saw the tears falling--drip, drip--from the old man's eyes.|$|R
2500|$|Bree then invites Reverend Sykes to dinner, {{who tries}} to {{convince}} Andrew to enroll in Christian counselling. He refuses, saying [...] "I'm not confused. I know exactly who I am." [...] This deeply upsets Bree, who tells him he has to change or {{he will not be}} with her in heaven; Andrew is shocked and agrees to meet the reverend. In his final scene of the season, after swearing the reverend to secrecy, Andrew states that, not only that he does not believe in God and lied to his parents about being gay {{to get out of the}} camp. This confuses the reverend, who asks him whether he is heterosexual or not: Andrew replies, [...] "Look, I love vanilla ice cream, okay? <b>But</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then I’m probably gonna be in the mood for chocolate." [...] He then says he will get revenge on Bree for rejecting him by pretending to be a model son and then doing something so awful it is [...] "going to really destroy her".|$|E
2500|$|Alternate identities {{presented}} include [...] "Damita Jo", {{an aggressive}} persona mentioned during the album's title track and [...] "Sexhibition", and [...] "Strawberry", a lascivious performer who emerges on [...] "Strawberry Bounce". Speaking about the personae, Jackson said [...] "She's {{another way to}} express and expose a deeper part of me." [...] "Damita Jo" [...] is [...] "a lot harsher, and quick {{to put you in}} your place. She doesn't sit and ponder about stuff, where I'll go, 'Should I or shouldn't I?' She's tougher than I am. Then there's Strawberry. She's the most sexual of them all, the wildest." [...] Blender magazine commented the latter identity represents [...] "a time when she doesn't need to be the polite, professional Janet, and can turn into raw, unrestrained Strawberry." [...] Jackson added [...] "It's not an everyday indulgence. Not even every week. <b>But</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then I like playing around in that mode." [...] Jackson said the characters [...] "absolutely" [...] live inside of her, exclaiming [...] "it feels wonderful" [...] to release them. The concept is further explored in [...] "Looking for Love", in which Jackson says every individual is composed of [...] "many people rolled into one," [...] unified by a similar motive of seeking love, companionship, or identity. Jackson previously desired to record an album which was a [...] "complete departure" [...] from what she is known for and title it after her middle name, but was convinced to use the title for the album by producer Dallas Austin. The title was initially used as self-acceptance; saying [...] "My mother made up [...] "Damita." [...] I presumed [...] "Jo" [...] was for Joseph, my father, even though I later learned it wasn't. Because he was emotionally withdrawn, I was never comfortable using it. For years I didn't. Now I love being called Jo. I've come to the point where I'm trying to accept - even embrace - everything that has happened to me. I believe that without acceptance there's no serenity." ...|$|E

5000|$|Stephanie Cronin of Oriental Institute, Oxford, {{describes}} corruption under rule of Reza Shah as [...] "large-scale". As {{oil prices}} rose in 1973, scale of corruption also rose, particularly among royal family, their partners and friends. According to Manouchehr Ganji who created a study group for Farah Pahlavi, Mohammad Reza Shah was not {{sensitive to the}} issue, <b>but</b> addressed <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then petty matters of low-ranking officials. As Ganji writes, the group submitted at least 30 solid reports within 13 years on corruption of high-ranking officials and the royal circle, but Shah called the reports [...] "false rumors and fabrications". Parviz Sabeti, a high-ranking official of SAVAK believed that the one important reason for success of regime's opposition is corruption.|$|R

6000|$|... "But {{as he ran}} forward he {{felt his}} flesh go cold and creepy all over. He had heard hounds run into foxes many times before, {{but he had never}} heard such sounds as these. They were not the cries of triumph, <b>but</b> of fear. <b>Every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then came a shrill yelp of mortal agony. Holding his breath, he ran on until he broke through the {{interlacing}} branches, and found himself in a little, clearing with the hounds all crowding round a patch of tangled bramble at the further end.|$|R

50|$|Magee, Sebastian, and Mary search {{a series}} of tunnels behind a bookcase. During their search, they get {{separated}} and Sebastian is hanged to death from the ceiling. Mary makes it back to Corrigan and Lionel while Magee remains lost in the tunnels. Corrigan soon reveals that he, in fact, is Roderick and that he escaped his prison decades ago, <b>but</b> returns <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then to make them think he was still trapped. He then proceeds to kill Lionel with a battle axe and chase Mary throughout the manor. Magee soon finds them and, after the ensuing fight, knocks Roderick down the stairs; during the fall, Roderick accidentally stabs himself with the axe. As Roderick is dying, his victims suddenly walk into the room, very much alive; it is revealed that all was a joke put on by Magee's publisher, even Roderick rises, his wound was also a fake.|$|R
60|$|In the {{meanwhile}} Lisle and Nasmyth {{were pushing}} on {{as fast as}} possible along the stony summit of the ridge. There was moonlight, which made it a little easier, <b>but</b> they stumbled <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then. Here and there they were forced to scramble down the sides of a gully and on reaching the bottom to plunge into water, and once they had to scramble some distance shut in by the rocks before they could find a means of ascending. Still, they were hard and inured to fatigue, and they never slackened the pace. When striding along a stretch of smoother ground Nasmyth gathered breath to speak.|$|R
60|$|Here Miss Knag {{paused to}} take breath, {{and while she}} pauses it may be observed--not that she was marvellously loquacious and marvellously deferential to Madame Mantalini, since these are facts which require no comment; <b>but</b> that <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then, she was accustomed, in the torrent of her discourse, to {{introduce}} a loud, shrill, clear 'hem!' the import and meaning of which, was variously interpreted by her acquaintance; some holding that Miss Knag dealt in exaggeration, and introduced the monosyllable when any fresh invention was in course of coinage in her brain; others, that when she wanted a word, she threw it in to gain time, and prevent anybody else from striking into the conversation. It may be further remarked, that Miss Knag still aimed at youth, although she had shot beyond it, years ago; {{and that she was}} weak and vain, and {{one of those people who}} are best described by the axiom, that you may trust them as far as you can see them, and no farther.|$|R
60|$|Armand {{walked with}} his hands buried in his {{breeches}} pockets, his head bent forward on his chest; <b>but</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> again he threw quick, apprehensive glances round him whenever a firm step echoed along the empty stage or a voice rang clearly through the now deserted theatre.|$|E
60|$|The {{little fellow}} was half-dozing, but words {{of prayer and}} faith kept {{dropping}} from his tongue.

60|$|The {{next meal}} came round. As they sat, Baptista would not suffer {{her eyes to}} turn towards him. He {{did not attempt to}} intrude upon her reserve, <b>but</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then looked under the table and chuckled with {{satisfaction}} at the aspect of affairs. 'How very well matched we be!' he said, comfortably.|$|E
60|$|She {{watched him}} write, without undue haste, <b>but</b> {{referring}} <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> {{then to the}} code-book by his side. If only he would {{get up and go}} into the bedroom for a moment, it might give her a chance. She could feel her heart beating underneath her gown. Every sense was thrilling with excitement; and then, all of a sudden, she had a great surprise. Almost a cry broke from her lips; almost she had taken that swift involuntary movement forward, for she realized suddenly that she {{was not the only one}} who was watching Norris Vine. Very softly a man, coatless and in his socks, had stolen out from the bedroom where he had lain concealed, and was looking in through the opening of the partly closed study door. Virginia felt her finger-nails dig into her flesh. She stood there rapt and breathless. Instinctively she felt that the cards had been taken from her hand, that she was to be a witness of events more swift and definite than any in which she herself could have borne the principal part.|$|R
40|$|Given {{a choice}} between two services, rest of the things being equal, it is natural to prefer the one with more stable Quality of Service(QoS). For certain applications, {{stability}} would weigh more than other factors. For example, {{in the case of}} a streaming media application that has a limited buffer, a server offering stable moderate bandwidth is preferred to one that offers high bandwidth most of time, <b>but</b> has outages <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then. In this work, we study the problem of a client choosing one out of a set of servers that offer time varying QoS, dynamically updating its choice, in order to achieve stable service. The QoS metric we consider in this work is bandwidth. ...|$|R
60|$|Alaric, when {{he heard}} the wheels roll off, shook from him his lethargy. It was not only that Neverbend would boast that he alone had gone through the perils of their {{subterranean}} duty, but that doubtless he would explain in London how his colleague had been deterred from following him. It was a grievous task, that of dressing himself, as youthful sinners know <b>but</b> too well. <b>Every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then a qualm would come over him, and make the work seem all but impossible. Boots, however, stuck to him like a man, poured cold water over his head, renewed his tea-cup, comforted him with assurances of the bracing air, and put a paper full of sandwiches in his pocket.|$|R
60|$|Lord Arranmore spoke again. Still he {{sat back}} in his high-backed chair, and still he spoke in measured, {{monotonous}} tones. But this time, if only their ears had been quick enough to notice it, there lay behind an emotion, held in check indeed, <b>but</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then quivering for expression. He had turned to Lady Caroom.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, you have!" [...] cried Dan, eagerly. [...] "I don't want to go, and I won't go, if I {{can help}} it; <b>but</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then I {{feel as if}} I must burst out somehow.

60|$|He {{accepted}} the rebuke lightly. He {{was far too}} happy in being with her to be troubled by vague limitations. The present {{was good enough for}} him, and he did his best to entertain her. He noticed with pleasure that she did not even glance at the pile of papers at her side. They talked without intermission. She was interested, even gay. Yet he could not <b>but</b> notice that <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then, especially at any reference to the future, her tone grew graver and a shadow passed across her face. Once he said something which suggested the possibility of her living always in England. She had shaken her head at once, gently but firmly.|$|R
60|$|The Black Prince, {{with the}} Lion, the Grace Marie {{and four other}} ships had swept round to turn the Spanish flank; but the {{movement}} was seen, and the Spaniards had ten ships with which to meet it, one of them their great carack the St. Iago di Compostella. To this ship the Prince had attached his little cog and strove desperately to board her, but her side was so high and the defense so desperate that his men could never get beyond her bulwarks but were hurled down again and again with a clang and clash to the deck beneath. Her side bristled with crossbowmen, who shot straight down on to the packed waist of the Lion, so that the dead lay there in heaps. But the most dangerous of all was a swarthy black-bearded giant in the tops, who crouched so that none could see him, <b>but</b> rising <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then with a huge lump of iron between his hands, hurled it down {{with such force that}} nothing would stop it. Again and again these ponderous bolts crashed through the deck and hurtled down {{into the bottom of the}} ship, starting the planks and shattering all that came in their way.|$|R
40|$|Graffiti is art, {{graffiti}} is crime, graffiti is beautiful, graffiti is ugly, graffiti is political, graffiti is style, graffiti is an ASBO, graffiti is Banksy. Regardless {{of where}} you sit in any debate {{on the value of}} graffiti, there is always one indelible truth: it exists. And to exist it must exist somewhere. It is in the study of this ‘where’ that we hope to learn something about the essence of these scribbles on walls. We ask: why is graffiti in this place and not in that place? We do this by taking a GIS approach to the question, in which we collect graffiti, digitise graffiti, analyse graffiti and visualise graffiti. We find that the physical factors which define the location of graffiti in the city centre are, for the most part, limited to perfunctory city constructs such as crossing guards, phone boxes and electricity boxes <b>but</b> that <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> again, city features come together {{in such a way as}} to create the opportunity for clusters of graffiti to exist. However, it is necessary that we not only locate graffiti in space, we also need to locate it within the motivations of the subculture to which it belongs. In the end we find graffiti to be a duel construct, made up of the desires of a global subculture and how the city allows these desires to be made manifest...|$|R
60|$|Hendry {{made his}} way into these gossips uninvited, for his {{opinions}} on dress were considered contemptible, though he was worth consulting on material. Jess and Leeby discussed many things in his presence, confident that his ears were not doing their work; <b>but</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then {{it was discovered that}} he had been hearkening greedily. If the subject was dress, he might then become a little irritating.|$|E
60|$|He stalked {{off with}} his 'ead in the air, and left me all alone {{in charge of a}} wharf with a ghost on it. I stayed outside in the street, of course, <b>but</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then I fancied I heard {{something}} moving about {{the other side of the}} gate, and once it was so distinct that I run along to the Bear's Head and knocked 'em up and asked them for a little brandy, for illness.|$|E
60|$|She {{hesitated for}} a moment and then, with a slight shrug of the shoulders, she yielded. There was a note in his tone not exactly insistent, and yet dominant, a note which she obeyed {{although}} secretly she wondered at herself for doing so. They passed inside the house and she followed him from room to room, leaving him to do all the talking. She seemed very little interested <b>but</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then she asked a languid question.|$|E
6000|$|Did {{he think}} of this as we journeyed up to town? I watched him, but could make but little of him. He was {{particularly}} gay, playing with his child, and turning to sport every word that was uttered. Perhaps he did this because he saw a cloud upon Perdita's brow. She tried to rouse herself, <b>but</b> her eyes <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then filled with tears, and she looked wistfully on Raymond and her girl, as if fearful that some evil would betide them. And so she felt. A presentiment of ill hung over her. She leaned from the window looking on the forest, and the turrets of the Castle, and as these became hid by intervening objects, she passionately exclaimed--"Scenes of happiness! scenes sacred to devoted love, when shall I see you again! and when I see ye, shall I be still the beloved and joyous Perdita, or shall I, heart-broken and lost, wander among your groves, the ghost of what I am!" ...|$|R
6000|$|We {{need not}} pursue the {{interview}} any further. By degrees {{they returned to}} the subject of the new promotion. Eleanor tried to prove to him, as the Grantlys had done, that his age could be no bar to his being a very excellent dean, but those arguments had now even less weight on him than before. He said little or nothing <b>but</b> sat, meditative. <b>Every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then he would kiss his daughter and say [...] "yes," [...] or [...] "no," [...] or [...] "very true," [...] or [...] "well, my dear, I can't quite agree with you there," [...] but he could not be got to enter sharply into the question of [...] "to be, or not to be" [...] Dean of Barchester. Of her and her happiness, of Mr. Arabin and his virtues, he would talk as much as Eleanor desired--and to tell the truth, that was not a little--but about the deanery he would now say nothing further. He had got a new idea into his head--why should not Mr. Arabin be the new dean? ...|$|R
40|$|Surely {{one of the}} {{key issues}} in historiography is how to account for those mind-boggling and {{sometimes}} extremely bloody events in which we enter something really, sublimely new. In this essay my point of departure is that retrospectively it is almost impossible even for the historical actors themselves to get access to the contingent, irrational, "sacrilegious" aspect of the sublime event they brought about. In order {{to get a grip on}} the evanescent essence of the historical sublime, I propose to bring to a head, instead of leveling down, the tension that characterizes all historical and biographical discontinuities: the tension between the fact that discontinuities are made by the participants, yet are portrayed by these very participants as having come as a surprise. I will argue that discontinuity is not a regrettable side-effect of our ambition to attain goals that are in line with our identity, <b>but</b> that <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then we give in to the urge to cut ourselves loose from our moorings. A key concept of the perspective that with sublime historical events "in the beginning is the deed" is vertigo. Vertigo may feel like a fear of falling, but really it is a wish to jump, covered by a fear of falling. Vertigo predisposes, as psychoanalysts say, to "counterphobic" behavior. Giving in to vertigo is a strategy for escaping from an unbearable tension by doing something-by breaking apart from what one used to cherish, by eating the apple, by committing an "original sin". Making history-in the sense of embarking upon something that is as sublimely new as the French Revolution or the First World War-thus is not a matter of pursuing some interest but of willfully fleeing forward into the unknown...|$|R
