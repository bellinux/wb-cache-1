He assumed the title of Celestial Emperor and designated an era name, named his oldest son Yelü Bei as his successor, and commissioned the construction of a Confucian temple. Two years later he established a capital city, Shangjing (上京), which imitated the model of a Chinese capital city.|$|E

25|$|The {{next two}} decades were a time of steady growth and {{prestige}} for Alpha Epsilon Pi, {{as well as other}} fraternities. Expansion was occurring at an incredible rate for the Greek system as a whole. However, with the onset of fighting in Vietnam in the early 1960s, fraternity life faltered. Liberal student bodies revolted against authority and the Greek system, which was seen as a conservative, elitist group. Membership plummeted and nearly half the chapter roll was lost. It almost looked as if it might have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> for Alpha Epsilon Pi. However the fraternity was able to reverse the trend and stabilize following the Vietnam War.|$|E

The agreement also led the UFW to end its boycott of lettuce, grapes, and wine in February 1978. Why did the two unions sign the agreement? UFW officials claimed the Teamsters {{were on the verge of}} losing a jurisdictional battle for 50,000 workers being decided by the ALRB, but at least one press report indicated that the scandal-scarred union wished to burnish its public image.|$|E

I will never forget the image of the two antagonists as they left the club: Einstein, with his tall and commanding figure, who walked tranquilly, with a mildly ironic smile, and Bohr who trotted along beside him, full of excitement...The morning after saw the triumph of Bohr.|$|E
500|$|There is some {{evidence}} that Terminus' associations could extend from property boundaries to limits more generally.

Diocletian's decision in 303 AD to initiate his persecution of Christians on February 23 has been seen as an attempt at enlisting Terminus [...] "to put a limit to the progress of Christianity".|$|E

They hypothesised that Phase II would have seen a similar decline in ratings as seen by Voyager {{during the course of the}} first season, except this decline would have resulted in the cancellation of Phase II at the time of first broadcast in 1970s.

500|$|In the First Victory Test, the Australian Servicemen scraped home by six wickets {{with only}} two balls and minutes to spare. The last pre-war series between England and Australia in 1938 had been an attritional and hard-nosed contest, but in the {{afterglow}} of the war victory, the cricketers played flamboyantly with abandon in front of packed crowds. The attractive, attacking style of play was widely praised by commentators and the match raised £1,935 for war relief charities. England then levelled the series by winning the Second Victory Test at Bramall Lane, Sheffield with a hard-fought battle, by [...] 41 runs. Australia won the Third Victory Test by four wickets late {{on the final day}} and drew the Fourth Victory Test at Lord's. That would have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the series, but because of the record attendance of 93,000 at Lord's, another match was appended. England drew the series by winning the Fifth Victory Test in front of another capacity crowd. The Victory Tests were regarded as an outstanding success, with a total attendance of 367,000 and bright and attacking play.|$|E

News of the singer's death reached Japan, where David Byrne first heard of the shooting. Univision and Telemundo were among the first national news stations to arrive at the crime scene. Carlos Lopez of KMIQ-105.1 told the Corpus Christi Caller-Times that [...] "Tejano music is dead for at least today" [...] and compared the reactions to Selena's death to reactions to the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and called March 31, 1995 [...] "Black Friday".

Robert Hilburn of Los Angeles Times was also negative in his review, calling it as an [...] "overwrought ballad" [...] and wrote it was un-listenable. Dara Cook of MTV Southeast Asia [...] named the song as [...] "a big-production tragicomedy of hilarious histrionics and absurdly dramatic lyrics." [...] While reviewing Carey's compilation The Ballads (2009), Chuck Campbell of The Press of Atlantic City wrote {{that at some point}} in Carey's career, the quality her songs got [...] "iffier" [...] and commented that [...] "Thank God I Found You" [...] is such an example. He {{went on to say that}} the song was a [...] "trifle".
