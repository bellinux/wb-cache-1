'It was left this evening,' says he, 'by a strange messenger, who went away directly. I told my servant to follow him; but it was too late--he was out of sight.' The letter was very short, and we thought it was in a woman's handwriting--a feigned handwriting, the clergyman said. There was no name signed, and no date at top or <b>bottom.</b> <b>Inside</b> it there was a ten-pound bank-note; and the person as sent it wrote that it was enclosed to bury the young woman decently. 'She was better dead than alive'--the letter went on--'after having disgraced her father and her relations. As for the child, it was the child of sin, and had no claim on people who desired to preserve all that was left of their good name, and to set a moral example to others. The parish must support it if nobody else would. It would be useless to attempt to trace them, or to advertise again. The baby's father had disappeared, they didn't know where; and they could hold no communication now with such a monster of wickedness, even if he was found. She was dead in her shame and her sin; and her name should never be mentioned among them she belonged to henceforth for ever.' ...|$|E

40|$|Differences in juice quality are {{associated}} with positional differences in canopy microclimate and exposure of individual fruit to light and temperature. Differences of internal fruit quality between fruit from different sectors of the tree were investigated. The trials were carried out with 'Mihowase' Satsuma and 'Nules' Clementine trees on Troyer citrange rootstock in Stellenbosch (34 °S; 19 °E) and 'Fairchild' and 'Temple' tangor trees on rough lemon rootstock in Citrusdal (32 ° 30 'S; 19 °E), South Africa. Fruit were harvested from four sectors in each tree, viz. north, south, east and west. Within each sector, fruit were harvested from three sub-sectors, i. e. the top, and the <b>inside</b> and outside <b>bottom</b> sub-sectors. Fruit from each sector were scored for colour, size, juice content, total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity (TA) and TSS:TA ratio. (i) Colour: 'Fairchild' fruit from all sub-sectors were fully coloured (orange) at harvest. There were no fruit colour differences between the sub-sectors in each sector {{for each of the}} other cultivars. The north sector had significantly greener fruit than the south sector for Satsumas, Clementines and 'Temple'. (ii) Fruit size: For Satsumas, Clementines and 'Temple' the top fruit were the largest and <b>inside</b> <b>bottom</b> fruit the smallest, but the opposite occurred for in 'Fairchild'. (iii) Juice content: The % juice content in all four cultivars was the lowest in top fruit and the highest in <b>inside</b> <b>bottom</b> fruit. (iv) Total soluble solids (TSS) : The TSS in all four cultivars was the highest in top fruit and the lowest in <b>inside</b> <b>bottom</b> fruit. The TSS in fruit from the north sector was significantly higher than fruit from the south sector for 'Fairchild' and 'Temple', with no differences for Satsumas and Clementines. (v) Titratable acidity (TA) : For Satsumas and Clementines the <b>inside</b> <b>bottom</b> fruit had the highest TA levels and outside bottom fruit the lowest levels, with no trends for 'Fairchild' and 'Temple'. (vi) TSS:TA ratio: Outside bottom fruit (Satsumas) and top fruit (Clementines, 'Fairchild' and 'Temple') had the highest TSS:TA ratios and <b>inside</b> <b>bottom</b> fruit the lowest. The north sector in all the cultivars had higher TSS:TA ratios than the south sector. Top and outside bottom fruit had the best quality.
