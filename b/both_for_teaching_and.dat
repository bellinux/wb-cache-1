For instance, in {{the arrangement of the}} smallest masses of color, the false idealist, or even the purist, depends upon perfecting each separate hue, and raises them all, as far as he can, into costly brilliancy; but the naturalist takes the coarsest and feeblest colors of the things around him, and so interweaves and opposes them that they become more lovely than if they had all been bright. So in the treatment of the human form. The naturalist will take it as he finds it; but, with such examples as his picture may rationally admit of more or less exalted beauty, he will associate inferior forms, so as not only to set off those which are most beautiful, but to bring out clearly what good there is in the inferior forms themselves; finally using such measure of absolute evil as there is commonly in nature, <b>both</b> <b>for</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> for contrast.|$|E

40|$|This project {{intends to}} find and {{implement}} a p 2 p overlay over the simctl platform. Simctl is used <b>both</b> <b>for</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> research in the network engineering department. P 2 P systems became an interesting area since early 2000. Researchers conducted {{a large amount of}} research in some challenging areas and, to check their experiments, several implementations and simulators were created. Over time, Internet has evolved and P 2 P has been widely used for file sharing, but the main structured P 2 P overlays were progressively abandoned. However, these overlays are still taught in network engineering courses. The aim of this master thesis is {{to find and}} implement a p 2 p overlay over the simctl platform, used <b>both</b> <b>for</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> research in the network engineering department. First, it is tried to locate and test the original structured P 2 P overlays source codes developed by the authors of the original publications.
