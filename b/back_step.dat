5|$|Dyer was {{a popular}} choice with boxing promoters, helped {{by the fact that}} after each bout he would sing Thora, a popular hit of the day to the audience. His careers as a pugilist and {{baritone}} earned him the nickname, 'The Singing Boxer'. His first few bouts were all held in south Wales, but by the autumn of 1910 he was travelling to England to fight, and on 10 October 1910 he was invited to fight at the National Sporting Club in Covent Garden, London. On 15 May 1911 Dyer was scheduled to fight Dick Emden at The Ring in Blackfriars, London. To date, Dyer had recorded over 15 bouts and was unbeaten but the fight with Emden ended in defeat and affected his future boxing career. Dyer was easily ahead in the bout, when in the fifth round he dislocated his knee and fell to the canvas in agony. Emden, who taunted the fallen Dyer, was given the victory and Dyer would not fight for another six months. The injury to his right knee plagued Dyer throughout his entire boxing career, and also stopped him serving in the armed forces during the First World War. After the injury, Dyer always fought with a protector strapped around his knee, and was forced to change his fighting style. He would always stand on the toes of his right foot, as a quick <b>back</b> <b>step</b> could possibly dislocate his knee again. His return bout in November 1911 was a win against Young Lilley at The Ring, but this was again followed by a long absence. Dyer did not fight again until 1 June 1912.|$|E

25|$|Kalân Mosque (Masjid-i Kalân), arguably {{completed}} in 1514, {{is equal to}} the Bibi-Khanym Mosque in Samarkand in size. The mosque is able to accommodate 12 thousand people. Although Kalyan Mosque and Bibi-Khanym Mosque of Samarkand are of the same type of building, they are different in terms of art of building. 288 monumental pylons serve as a support for the multidomed roofing of the galleries encircling the courtyard of Kalyan Mosque. The longitudinal axis of the courtyard ends up with a portal to the main chamber (maksura) with a cruciform hall, topped with a massive blue cupola on a mosaic drum. The edifice keeps many architectural curiosities, for example, a hole in one of domes. Through this hole one can see foundation of Kalyan Minaret. Then moving <b>back</b> <b>step</b> by step, one can count all belts of brickwork of the minaret to the rotunda.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{nonlinear}} and adaptive <b>back</b> <b>stepping</b> control of linear induction motors. Specifically, we present an exact model knowledge controller that ensures exponentially tracking of a time-varying velocity profile and an adaptive controller that ensures velocity tracking error signal converges to zero asymptotically.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{develops}} repetitive and iterative {{learning control}} design and analysis for <b>back</b> <b>stepping</b> controlled nonlinear systems. To precisely track periodic or finite duration trajectories for nonlinear systems, <b>back</b> <b>stepping</b> control is first designed to render closed loop stability and, in theory, asymptotic tracking performance. However, {{due to the}} sensitivity to the unmodelled dynamics plant variations, asymptotic tracking performance is usually not feasible. Thus, repetitive or learning control is applied over the <b>back</b> <b>stepping</b> controlled system to restore asymptotic tracking performance. This approach is applied to an electrohydraulic material testing system, in which the material specimen present substantial nonlinear force and displacement relationship. It will be shown that the <b>back</b> <b>stepping</b> control employs both feedback and feedforward actions to render linearized I/O plant and thus the outer loop repetitive and learning control design can {{be based on the}} compensated linear system. Experimental results will be given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|R
500|$|Players {{navigate}} linear {{levels with}} the selected character, able {{to interact with}} certain environmental elements and jump over obstacles or onto higher platforms. During combat, the player is able to move freely within the environment, and has access {{to a variety of}} moves including a <b>back</b> <b>step</b> and strafing to avoid attacks. Enemies encountered in areas include humans, hostile animals, machines, and supernatural entities. The player character, who can lock onto enemies during combat, has a standard attack option, with combos achieved through consecutive attacks. An [...] "EX Gauge" [...] can be charged up and released to trigger a powerful attack. The player can also leap over and strike an enemy from behind—these actions open the enemy up to a high-damage attack. The player can find several types of items within each level; these include various sizes of life capsules which replenish health, increase attack power for a limited time, and gain PSI points from defeated enemies. PSI points are essential when brainjacking new characters, as the Maken can only brainjack a character with a lower or equivalent PSI level.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{position}} {{control of a}} linear induction motor using adaptive fuzzy <b>back</b> <b>stepping</b> design with integral action is proposed. First, the indirect field oriented control for LIM is derived. Then, an integral <b>back</b> <b>stepping</b> design for indirect field oriented control of LIM is proposed to compensate the uncertainties which occur in the control. Finally, the fuzzy integral-back stepping controller is investigated, where a simple fuzzy inference mechanism is used to achieve a position tracking objective under the mechanical parameters uncertainties. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified by numerical simulation. The numerical validation results of the proposed scheme have presented good performances compared to the conventional integral <b>back</b> <b>stepping</b> control...|$|R
