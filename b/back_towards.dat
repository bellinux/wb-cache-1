5|$|Meanwhile, between March 13 and 15, the VPA 6th Regiment {{launched}} several {{attacks on}} Chuc Meo, La Son, Hill 300 and Hill 511 located west of Huế, forcing {{elements of the}} ARVN 1st Infantry Division to pull <b>back</b> <b>towards</b> Dong Tranh and Binh Dien.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 30 May, a British {{squadron}} sailing off La Havre spotted the French ships pulling {{to the west and}} gave chase, Captain Laforey leading in the 38-gun , followed by the bomb vessel , under Captain Robert Fitzgerald, and the 12-gun cutter , under Lieutenant Henry Garrett. Discovering the British in pursuit, Pevrieux ordered his squadron to retreat towards the shore, tacking in front of Hydra and opening an ineffective fire at long range. Laforey continued his approach, and a 06:00 successfully tacked Hydra into a position between Confiante and Vésuve, which had turned <b>back</b> <b>towards</b> the shore. Although the British frigate came under fire from both French ships, their attacks had little impact. Laforey was able to concentrate his broadside against Vésuve and rapidly forced the French corvette to turn inshore, pursued by Vesuvius and Trial. Laforey then set off in pursuit of Confiante, which was attempting to turn <b>back</b> <b>towards</b> Le Havre. The French cutter was unable to escape the British pursuit and its crew deliberately drove it ashore near the mouth of the Dives River.|$|E
5|$|The {{main body}} of Texian soldiers, under Collinsworth, became disoriented {{in the dark and}} wandered from the road. They were soon tangled in a {{mesquite}} thicket. While working their way <b>back</b> <b>towards</b> the road, the Texians met Ben Milam, a Texas colonist who had recently escaped from prison in Monterrey. Milam joined the militia as a private, and the group soon rejoined the vanguard.|$|E

5|$|The rebels, {{heading for}} Warminster {{got as far}} as Trowbridge, but royalist forces cut off the route and Monmouth turned <b>back</b> <b>towards</b> Somerset through Shepton Mallet, {{arriving}} in Wells on 1 July. The soldiers damaged the Bishop's Palace and west front of Wells Cathedral, tearing lead from the roof to make bullets, breaking the windows, smashing the organ and the furnishings, and for a time stabling their horses in the nave.|$|E
5|$|Albert of Aachen says William's second {{desertion}} {{occurred in}} June 1098, along with William of Grand-Mesnil, {{a relative of}} Bohemond. On the road away from Antioch, they joined Stephen of Blois, another leader of the crusade who had also fled the siege. They travelled <b>back</b> <b>towards</b> Constantinople, but on the way met Emperor Alexius I Comnenus, who was advancing to Antioch with a relief army. They convinced him of the futility of the crusader siege and the emperor turned back to Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|As {{the group}} left Plateros at 22:30 to trek <b>back</b> <b>towards</b> American lines, Pajota and his guerrillas {{continually}} sought out local villagers {{to provide additional}} carabao carts to transport the weakened prisoners. The majority of the prisoners {{had little or no}} clothing and shoes, and it became increasingly difficult for them to walk. When the group reached Balincarin, they had accumulated nearly 50carts. Despite the convenience of using the carts, the carabao traveled at a sluggish pace, only , which greatly reduced the speed of the return trip. By the time the group reached American lines, 106carts were being used.|$|E

5|$|At 05:00 on 23 April 1918, {{the entire}} High Seas Fleet, {{including}} Bayern and Baden, left harbor {{with the intention}} of intercepting one of the heavily escorted convoys. Wireless radio traffic was kept to a minimum to prevent the British from learning of the operation. However, at 05:10 on 24 April, the battlecruiser Moltke suffered severe mechanical problems and had to be towed back to Wilhelmshaven. By 14:10, the convoy had still not yet been located, and so Scheer turned the High Seas Fleet <b>back</b> <b>towards</b> German waters. In fact, there was no convoy sailing on 24 April; German naval intelligence had miscalculated the sailing date by one day.|$|E
5|$|By {{the second}} half of the 20th century, the {{pendulum}} had swung <b>back</b> <b>towards</b> road transport. The Cromford Canal was largely abandoned in 1944, and several of the rail lines passing through the Peak were closed as uneconomic in the 1960s as part of the Beeching Axe. The Woodhead Line was closed between Hadfield and Penistone. Parts of the trackbed are now used for the Trans Pennine Trail, the stretch between Hadfield and Woodhead being known specifically as the Longdendale Trail.|$|E
5|$|Despite ineffectual {{long-range}} gunfire {{towards the}} British ship by {{the remainder of}} the Spanish squadron, the isolated Santa Dorotea was rapidly forced to surrender, O'Neil eventually turning the other three frigates <b>back</b> <b>towards</b> Cartagena. Unopposed, Dixon was able to consolidate his prize and send it to St Vincent's fleet off Cadiz, where it was subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy. Lion remained in the Mediterranean during the year, later participating in the blockades of Malta and Alexandria. The Spanish, their seaports carefully guarded by Royal Navy squadrons, launched no further expeditions into the Mediterranean during the year.|$|E

5|$|During the day, {{the storm}} crossed 180°, {{entering}} the western Pacific basin and being re-designated as a typhoon. The storm tracked steadily northwestward, attaining a peak intensity of 125mph (205km/h), a high-end Category 3 storm, before turning <b>back</b> <b>towards</b> the east. The storm gradually weakened, transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on September17 and again crossing the International Date Line. The system dissipated shortly thereafter over open waters. Throughout its existence, Hurricane/Typhoon Della traveled roughly , the longest known track of any Pacific hurricane at the time.|$|E
5|$|Having {{failed to}} break through to Berlin, Wenck's XII Army made a {{fighting}} retreat <b>back</b> <b>towards</b> the Elbe and American lines after providing the IX Army survivors with surplus transport. By 6 May many German Army units and individuals had crossed the Elbe and surrendered to the US Ninth Army. Meanwhile, the XII Army's bridgehead, with its headquarters in the park of Schönhausen, came under heavy Soviet artillery bombardment and was compressed into an area eight by two kilometres (five by one and a quarter miles).|$|E
5|$|Herodotus {{says that}} when the Persians in Asia Minor heard {{of the attack on}} Sardis, they {{gathered}} together, and marched to the relief of Artaphernes. When they arrived at Sardis, they found the Greeks recently departed. So they followed their tracks <b>back</b> <b>towards</b> Ephesus. They caught up with the Greeks outside Ephesus and the Greeks were forced to turn and prepare to fight. Holland suggests that the Persians were primarily cavalry (hence their ability {{to catch up with the}} Greeks). The typical Persian cavalry of the time were probably missile cavalry, whose tactics were to wear down a static enemy with volley after volley.|$|E

5|$|None of the carpals (wrist bones) fit {{together}} precisely, suggesting {{the presence of}} a large amount of cartilage in the wrist, which would have stiffened it. All of the digits were able to hyperextend (bend backwards) until they nearly touched the wrist. When flexed, the middle digit would converge towards the first digit, while the third digit would twist inwards. The first digit of the hand bore the largest claw, which was permanently flexed so that it curved <b>back</b> <b>towards</b> the underside of the hand. Likewise, the middle claw may have been permanently flexed, while the third claw, also the smallest, was able to both flex and extend.|$|E
5|$|On June 24, 1832, Black Hawk {{and about}} 200 warriors {{attacked}} at the hastily constructed Apple River Fort, near present-day Elizabeth, Illinois. Local settlers, warned of Black Hawk's approach, {{took refuge in}} the fort, which was defended by about 20 to 35 militiamen. The Battle of Apple River Fort lasted about forty-five minutes. The women and girls inside the fort, {{under the direction of}} Elizabeth Armstrong, loaded muskets and molded bullets. After losing several men, Black Hawk broke off the siege, looted the nearby homes, and headed <b>back</b> <b>towards</b> his camp.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 22 June, Nelson's fleet passed the French in the darkness, {{overtaking}} the slow invasion convoy without realising how close they were to their target. Making rapid time on a direct route, Nelson reached Alexandria on 28 June and discovered that the French were not there. After {{a meeting with the}} suspicious Ottoman commander, Sayyid Muhammad Kurayyim, Nelson ordered the British fleet northwards, reaching the coast of Anatolia on 4 July and turning westwards <b>back</b> <b>towards</b> Sicily. Nelson had missed the French by less than a day—the scouts of the French fleet arrived off Alexandria in {{the evening of}} 29 June.|$|E

5|$|Rowley, {{stationed}} at Saint-Paul {{to the west}} of Saint-Denis, received word that Africaine had arrived at Saint Denis and immediately sought to drive off the French blockade. Sailing eastwards, Boadicea came within sight of Bouvet's squadron at 15:00 and the British flagship followed by the small brigs HMS Otter and HMS Staunch. Corbet recognised Rowley's intention and joined the attack, embarking 25 soldiers from the 86th Regiment of Foot to replace his losses at Grand Bay. The French, still believing Africaine to be Boadicea, assumed that Boadicea was an East Indiaman named Windham in disguise, and fell <b>back</b> <b>towards</b> Isle de France before the British force.|$|E
5|$|Ryu has {{the ability}} to jump on and off ladders and walls, and by using the {{directional}} pad, he can climb up or down ladders. Ryu can spring off walls by holding the directional pad in the opposite direction he is facing and pressing the jump button. He cannot attack while on walls or ladders. Players can use this technique to get Ryu to climb up spaces between walls and columns by holding down the jump button and alternating between left and right on the directional pad. Ryu can also vertically climb a single wall by springing off it and then quickly pressing the directional pad <b>back</b> <b>towards</b> the wall.|$|E
5|$|The Belgian expedition, led by Commandant Louis-Napoléon Chaltin, {{reached the}} {{position}} after a month-long advance north-east towards the Mahdist stronghold. The rebels, numbering two-thousand, {{had established a}} two-mile line {{across a range of}} hills, giving their numerically superior forces a tactical advantage over Chaltin's eight-hundred men. After a failed flanking maneuver by the Mahdists, Chaltin's forces stormed the heights and dislodged the rebel defenders. The Congolese companies pursued the retreating Mahdists <b>back</b> <b>towards</b> the town of Rejaf, where a final defense was made and similarly defeated.|$|E
