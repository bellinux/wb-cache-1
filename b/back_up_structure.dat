40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} neural net based on-line scheme for {{modelling}} discrete-time multivariable nonlinear dynamical systems. Taking {{the advantage of}} structural features of RBF (Radial-Basis-Function) neural nets, the method approaches the modelling problem by setting up a coarse RBF model structure {{in the light of}} the spatial Fourier transform and spatial sampling theory, then devising appropriate on-line algorithms to carry out refinements for both the RBF net structure and the associated weights. Main convergence results are established in the paper along with the analysis <b>backing</b> <b>up</b> the <b>structure</b> initialization and adaptation. The effectiveness of the scheme is illustrated with an simulation example. 1 Introduction The problem to be addressed in this paper is the following: Let an input sequence fu t g and the corresponding output sequence fy t g (t = 0; 1; : : :) of an unknown nonlinear discrete-time multivariable dynamical system of the form y t+ 1 = f(y t; y tΓ 1; [...] ...|$|R

Quite literally crackling with energy and dense with ideas from the first to the hidden 12th track, Freak In is one of the strongest CDs of his extraordinary career". On All About Jazz Matt Rand stated [...] "For years, Douglas has been involved in all sorts of breaking down and building <b>back</b> <b>up</b> of existing <b>structure.</b> But now Douglas has refined his approach, and has made a record that defines its own style".|$|R
50|$|After {{many years}} of decline a survey was {{commissioned}} by Natural England in 2002. It showed that the ecological condition of the river had declined. The principal reasons for this were water quality and siltation. Water quality has been addressed and was improving, but the physical character of the river needs to be restored. In 2008, a partnership known as the River Wensum Restoration Strategy (RWRS) was formed between; Environment Agency; Water Management Alliance and Natural England to restore the physical functioning of the Wensum. The 2002 report found that fourteen redundant water mills along the Wensum as having the most significant factor affecting morphology of the river channel, with 67% of the river <b>backed</b> <b>up</b> behind these <b>structures.</b> As a priority, the strategy recommended the lowering, removal or bypassing of these structures to allow more of the river to function naturally. Since 2008, the (RWRS) has made several improvements to the river. The holistic whole river approach with co-operation from land owners, fisheries managers and other organisations has seen ongoing projects ranging from restoring gravel glides to removing silt.|$|R
