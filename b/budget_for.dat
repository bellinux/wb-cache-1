5|$|The {{continuing}} {{success of}} the OAO program encouraged increasingly strong consensus within the astronomical community that the LST should be a major goal. In 1970, NASA established two committees, one to plan the engineering side of the space telescope project, {{and the other to}} determine the scientific goals of the mission. Once these had been established, the next hurdle for NASA was to obtain funding for the instrument, which would be far more costly than any Earth-based telescope. The U.S. Congress questioned many aspects of the proposed <b>budget</b> <b>for</b> the telescope and forced cuts in the <b>budget</b> <b>for</b> the planning stages, which at the time consisted of very detailed studies of potential instruments and hardware for the telescope. In 1974, public spending cuts led to Congress deleting all funding for the telescope project.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that public {{employee}} unions can affect the <b>budgets</b> <b>for</b> their municipal services. I determine the specific sources of these increased <b>budgets</b> <b>for</b> municipal services: increased wages, nonwage bargaining issues, or political activity. Using data from national, cross-sectional samples for police and fire departments, I show that increased union wages do not affect the size of police and fire budgets size whereas nonwage bargaining outcomes and union political activity do affect police and fire budgets. Thus, nonwage contract issues should be recognized as another important vehicle for public employee unions to affect the <b>budgets</b> <b>for</b> their services. ...|$|R

5|$|Alfonsín {{stayed on}} as {{president}} of the UCR, leaving after the party's defeat in the 1991 legislative elections. Suffering damage to its image because of the hyperinflation of 1989, the UCR lost in several districts. Alfonsín became president of the party again in 1993. He supported the creation of a special <b>budget</b> <b>for</b> the province of Buenos Aires, led by governor Eduardo Duhalde. The radical legislator Leopoldo Moreau supported the new budget even more vehemently than the Peronists. Both parties had an informal alliance in the province. Alfonsín also supported the amendment to the constitution of Buenos Aires that allowed Duhalde to run for re-election.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Lennig {{asserted}} that MGM's official <b>budget</b> <b>for</b> Greed was suspiciously high {{for a film}} with no stars, no built sets, a small crew and inexpensive film stock.

The Merry Widow ended up being a hit and earned more profits than Greed had lost; it cost $614,961 but earned $996,226 on its initial run.|$|E

5|$|During the General Assembly's 2005 session, Fletcher again {{proposed}} his {{tax reform}} plan, and {{late in the}} session, both houses passed it. The plan raised sin taxes on cigarettes and alcohol, as well as upping taxes on satellite television service and motel rooms. Businesses were also subjected to a gross receipts tax. In exchange, corporate taxes were lowered, as were income taxes for individuals who earned less than $75,000 annually; 300,000 low-wage earners were dropped from the income tax rolls altogether. The Assembly also passed a <b>budget</b> <b>for</b> {{the remainder of the}} biennium, abolished the state's public campaign finance laws, and passed new school nutrition guidelines.|$|E
5|$|During the war it {{had become}} clear that private {{patronage}} {{was no longer a}} practical means of sustaining Britain's musical life; a state body, the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts – the forerunner of the Arts Council – was established, and given a modest <b>budget</b> <b>for</b> public subsidy. The council made it a condition of sponsoring the LSO that the profit-sharing principle should be abandoned and the players made salaried employees. This renunciation of the principles for which the LSO had been founded was rejected by the players, and the offered subsidy was declined.|$|E

The company believed that the pair's humor matched well with that of Maniac Mansion and suggested working on a sequel. The two developers agreed and commenced production. Gilbert and Gary Winnick, the creators of Maniac Mansion, collaborated with Grossman and Schafer on the initial planning and writing. The total <b>budget</b> <b>for</b> the game was about $600,000, according to Schafer.|$|E
