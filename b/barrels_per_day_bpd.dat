30|$|High-severity fluid {{catalytic}} cracking (HS-FCC) is a breakthrough technology in the refining and petrochemicals industry. It allows refineries to produce petrochemicals from heavy oils by converting a low-value refinery stream into high-value products, suitable for integrated processes. The process’s main operating features are the down flow reactor system, high reaction temperature, short residence time, and high catalyst-to-oil (C/O) ratio with a modified separator system. The unique down flow reactor system in the HS-FCC process ensures plug flow without back-mixing, allowing more selectivity toward light olefins. HS-FCC produces four times more light olefins (propylene and butene) and higher octane gasoline than conventional FCC units. Since 1999, the HS-FCC has successfully passed several phases of testing with different types of feedstock at various feed capacities. The process has been proven in a 30 <b>barrel</b> <b>per</b> <b>day</b> (<b>bpd)</b> demonstration plant at Ras Tanura Refinery, Saudi Arabia. In 2011, a 3, 000 BPD HS-FCC semi-commercial plant started operating at JX Mizushima Refinery in Japan. The unit ran successfully, meeting all design objectives. A full-scale commercial unit study for a 30, 000 BPD HS-FCC plant was completed by JX and Chiyoda for HS-FCC commercialization.|$|R

In addition, he also exerted serious effort to ensure the members of the African Union and other countries such as Russia, China and other southeastern Asia of Libya's interest to maintain mutually beneficial political, security, and economic relationships and collaboration that are based on mutual respect and respect for national sovereignty and interests. His government called for and held a security conference that involved the ministers of defense and the security in the neighboring countries including Egypt, Sudan, Chad, Niger, Algeria, Tunis, Morocco, Mauritania, and Mali.

5000|$|The Alaska {{oil spill}} {{had a major}} impact on BP as it was a loss to its image as well as a {{financial}} loss. On March 15, the U.S. Transportation Department ordered BP to test its three low-pressure lines in Prudhoe Bay for corrosion using a smart pig. The western line had not been smart-pigged since 1998 and an eastern section of pipe had not been tested since 1992.

On August 7, BP announced data from a smart pig run completed in late July revealed severe corrosion and 16 anomalies in 12 locations in an oil transit line on {{the eastern side of the}} oil field. They said that that information along with another small spill prompted them to shut down the Prudhoe Bay oil field, which would reduce Alaska North Slope oil production by an estimated 400,000 <b>barrels</b> <b>per</b> <b>day.</b> [...] Later <b>BP</b> decided not to shut the western side of the field, meaning Prudhoe Bay would still produce about 200,000 barrels a day, half its normal total.

40|$|One of {{the largest}} oil {{reserves}} {{in the world is}} not in the Middle East or in Alaska, but in Canada. This fuel exists in the form of bitumen in Alberta's oil sands. While it takes a tremendous amount of energy to recover this bitumen and refine it into petroleum products, with oil prices nearing all time highs, it is profitable to do so. Oil sands recovery involves either strip mining the sands and extracting the oil, or pumping large quantities of steam into the ground in order to free the bitumen from the sand. Traditionally, the energy to produce the steam and hot water used in this process has come from natural gas. The use of natural gas for oil sands recovery presents a number of problems, among which are the environmental impact of the greenhouse gases and the price volatility of the natural gas market. This thesis explores the possibility of using nuclear energy to power oil sands recovery. Once operational, nuclear reactors produce no greenhouse gas emissions of carbon dioxide and offer relatively low and stable fuel and operation and maintenance costs. Uranium is not subject to the same market volatility as natural gas. There are, however, several trade-offs as well. This thesis compares the benefits and the drawbacks, and puts forth several complete scenarios for the introduction of nuclear technology into the oil sands recovery process. Nuclear energy used for steam production is found to be competitive with natural gas prices as low as $ 3. 75 /MMBtu (CAD). (cont.) For electricity production, nuclear becomes competitive at natural gas prices of $ 8. 50 /MMBtu (CAD). The greenhouse gas impact of nuclear is to reduce emissions in the oil sands region, as much as 3. 3 million metric tons per year avoided for a 100 k <b>barrel</b> <b>per</b> <b>day</b> (<b>bpd)</b> bitumen production Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) facility, or 2. 7 million metric tons per year for the replacement of 700 MWe of grid electricity with nuclear power. For a steam supply scenario, the PBMR reactor is found to be well-sized to supply a 50, 000 bpd SAGD plant, whereas the CANDU and ACR reactors considered are found to be too large, with too low pressure steam to be practical in that application. All of the reactors have potential for supplying heat and electricity for direct mining operations, however. In summary, nuclear energy applications appear to be well suited for long term oil sands production in an economically competitive, CO 2 emission free way which would greatly help Canada in meeting its Kyoto greenhouse gas emission commitments and to continue responsible development of its rich oil sands resources. Chapter One lays out the background information regarding the basic methods of production used in the oil sands today and the technologies that are being studied for possible future use. (cont.) Chapter Two describes the challenges that face the oil sands industry in the current development environment, while Chapter Three details the energy requirements of the oil sands industry and surveys the energy generation options available in the region. Chapter Four provides a description of the reactors that have been suggested for this application, and sets out their steam capacities for the SAGD application. Chapter Five proposes a set of possible scenarios for integrating nuclear energy into oil sands projects and sets forth the steps that need to be taken to accomplish that integration, as well as the requisite benefits and economic implications of doing so. Finally, Chapter 6 concludes with a discussion of the results and makes recommendations for future work. by Ashley Finan. Thesis (S. M. and S. B.)
