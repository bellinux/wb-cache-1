5|$|In Greek antiquity {{the ideas}} of {{celestial}} spheres and rings {{first appeared in the}} cosmology of Anaximander in the early 6th century BC. In his cosmology both the Sun and Moon are circular open vents in tubular rings of fire enclosed in tubes of condensed air; these rings constitute the rims of rotating chariot-like wheels pivoting on the Earth at their centre. The fixed stars are also open vents in such wheel rims, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> many such wheels for the stars that their contiguous rims all together form a continuous spherical shell encompassing the Earth. All these wheel rims had originally been formed out of an original sphere of fire wholly encompassing the Earth, which had disintegrated into many individual rings. Hence, in Anaximanders's cosmogony, in the beginning was the sphere, out of which celestial rings were formed, from some of which the stellar sphere was in turn composed. As viewed from the Earth, the ring of the Sun was highest, that of the Moon was lower, and the sphere of the stars was lowest.|$|E
25|$|Barking geckos {{were common}} in shrublands {{all around the}} Wellington region up until the 1960s and 1970s but populations have {{declined}} enormously since then. DOC has tried to establish populations of this species on Mana Island <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> few animals left in wild populations {{in the region that}} they have had to resort to transferring animals taken either from the jaws of pet cats or captive bred animals from private collections. Both the Naultinus released on Mana and a natural population on Kapiti Island have failed to thrive, which is mysterious, because these habitats are rodent free. One suggested cause about which little research has been done is vespid wasp predation, as these insects have been observed killing both adult and baby Naultinus. Naultinus gemmeus are known from the mainland of Southland from a few sightings by members of the public but despite numerous searches in recent years, not a single animal has been sighted or photographed here and it is speculated that this population is either critically endangered or already functionally extinct.|$|E

[...] One deputy complained, [...] "if {{there were only}} 30,000, {{it would be a}} simple matter of putting them all to the sword, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> many!" [...] Boullemer's written {{description}} of the event was published as a [...] pamphlet in November 1793, and the representative on mission, Jacques Garnier, sent a thousand copies to the Convention, the Executive Council and to all departments; it also served as a basis for the official report that François Toussaint Villers presented to the Convention.|$|E

While the {{solution}} {{comes with a}} shock of surprise, it is logical enough: the clues are there, one could fasten upon them and assess their importance. Perhaps it is another case of the reader being unable to see the wood for the trees; <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> many trees. Not this author's best crime novel, Appointment with Death is yet clever enough and convincing enough to stand {{head and shoulders above}} the average work of the kind." ...|$|E

2500|$|For the reboot film, Guillermo del Toro {{said his}} Frankenstein {{would be a}} {{faithful}} [...] "Miltonian tragedy", citing Frank Darabont's [...] "near perfect" [...] script, which evolved into Kenneth Branagh's Frankenstein. Del Toro said of his vision, [...] "What I'm {{trying to do is}} take the myth and do something with it, but combining elements of Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein without making it just a classical myth of the monster. The best moments in my mind of Frankenstein, of the novel, are yet to be filmed ... The only guy that has ever nailed for me the emptiness, not the tragic, not the Miltonian dimension of the monster, but the emptiness is Christopher Lee in the Hammer films, where he really looks like something obscenely alive. Boris Karloff has the tragedy element nailed down <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> many versions, including that great screenplay by Frank Darabont that was ultimately not really filmed." [...] He has also cited Bernie Wrightson's illustrations as inspiration, and said the film will not focus on the monster's creation, but be an adventure film featuring the character. Del Toro said he would like Wrightson to design his version of the creature. The film will also focus on the religious aspects of Shelley's tale. In June 2009, del Toro stated that production on Frankenstein was not likely to begin for at least four years. [...] Despite this, he has already cast frequent collaborator Doug Jones in the role of Frankenstein's monster. [...] In an interview with Sci Fi Wire, Jones stated that he learned of the news the same day as everybody else; that [...] "Guillermo did say to the press that he’s already cast me as his monster, but we’ve yet to talk about it. But in his mind, if that’s what he’s decided, then it's done ... It would be a dream come true." [...] The film will be a period piece. It is unclear what stage of development this film is in.|$|E
