40|$|We {{consider}} vertical price restrictions like Recommended Retail Prices (RRP) and Resale Price Maintenance (RPM), {{together with}} a retailer’s unit discount when purchasing the good from the manufacturer. We study how retailer’s <b>buyer</b> <b>power</b> affects {{the nature of the}} vertical price restriction occurring in equilibrium. A bit unexpectedly, it emerges that <b>buyer</b> <b>power</b> has got a non—monotonic relation with welfare: when it is either small or very large, welfare is at its lowest level. When <b>buyer</b> <b>power</b> is at an intermediate level, society is better off. The following trade—off explains these results: on the one hand, RPM eliminates double marginalization; on the other hand, to convince the retailer to accept it, a higher unit discount must be given. Our analysis suggests that antitrust authorities should take <b>buyer</b> <b>power</b> into account when assessing welfare effects of vertical price restrictions, and should be open to deal with its non—monotonic relation with welfare.

40|$|The study {{investigates the}} effect of <b>buyer</b> <b>power</b> on {{vertical}} price re-strictions such as Recommended Retail Prices (RRP) and Maximum Resale Price Maintenance (RPM). <b>Buyer</b> <b>power</b> affects both {{the level of the}} unit discount obtained by the retailer when purchasing goods from the manufacturer and the retail price control. We show that only when a retailer’s <b>buyer</b> <b>power</b> is small can RRP be an equilibrium so-lution while, if <b>buyer</b> <b>power</b> is high, Maximum RPM occurs. RRP is dominated, from a welfare point of view, by Maximum RPM, since the latter eliminates double marginalization. Hence we find no reason, unlike the current attitude of antitrust authorities, to prefer RRP to Maximum RPM. The presence of <b>buyer</b> <b>power</b> gives rise to a second distortion, the unit discount, which does not enable any vertical price restriction to achieve its first best outcome.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} <b>buyer</b> <b>power</b> in {{the presence}} of upstream competition to supply a homogeneous product. A likely consequence of upstream competition is that each supplier is uncertain of its final output, because it does not know how many downstream buyers will select it as a seller. We present a model where, for this reason, final volumes are uncertain for each seller. We find a new source of <b>buyer</b> <b>power</b> when the surplus function is nonlinear: the event of negotiation with a large buyer increases the seller's expected output, which changes the expected average net surplus from the deal; this increases <b>buyer</b> <b>power</b> when the seller's surplus function is concave (and diminishes it when convex).

40|$|In {{the basic}} model of {{transaction}} cost analysis (TCA), neither market power nor power based on resource-dependence plays a significant role. In this article, we extend the TCA-perspective by combining resource-dependence theory (RDT) and TCA, and examine whether the <b>buyer's</b> bargaining <b>power</b> influences the {{alignment of the}} contractual safeguarding of buyer-specific and supplier-specific investments. Data from a survey of 160 industrial purchasing relationships provide empirical support for our theoretical predictions. The empirical findings demonstrate that the <b>buyer's</b> bargaining <b>power</b> does interfere with the safeguarding of relations-specific assets. As the <b>buyer's</b> relative bargaining <b>power</b> increases, the safeguarding of buyer-specific assets is substantially reinforced. On the other hand, the contractual protection of supplier-specific assets is significantly relaxed as the <b>buyer's</b> bargaining <b>power</b> grows. Our findings indicate {{that there is a}} tension between the alignment of contractual safeguarding arrangements and structural power in inter-firm business, and that resource-dependence considerations offer an important complement to TCA when we consider the transacting parties' ability to provide contractual safeguards for assets at risk. Further, the findings indicate that the establishment of relational ties in long-term relationships is an important antecedent to governance structure. The empirical findings demonstrate that the longer a business-to-business relationship lasts, the more the contractual governance is relaxed. ...|$|R

40|$|The U. S. Departments of Justice and Agriculture {{have focused}} {{attention}} recently on rising levels of corporate concentration in agricultural {{markets and the}} challenges that may pose to U. S. anti-trust enforcement and agricultural policies. Both agencies have raised particular concerns about dominant firms’ exercise of <b>buyer</b> <b>power</b> over farmers, especially in livestock markets controlled by a shrinking number of large multinational meat packers. U. S. hog markets have undergone rapid concentration in the last 25 years, with the top four packers now controlling two-thirds {{of the market and}} Smithfield Foods, the industry leader, commanding 31 percent. Despite the rapid structural changes in the U. S. hog industry, the literature on <b>buyer</b> <b>power</b> in hog markets is quite limited. In this paper, we review the available literature, which has been generally presented as demonstrating that <b>buyer</b> <b>power</b> is not a significant problem. We find that interpretation to be poorly justified. Researchers have found well-documented evidence of market power on both the seller and the buyer sides of the market, though the studies have been less clear on the specific causes. Mirroring prevailing practices in Justice Department merger reviews, researchers have often discounted <b>buyer</b> <b>power</b> using methodologies more appropriate to seller power, then dismissed findings of seller power by pointing to offsetting “efficiency gains” from concentration. Yet such apparent efficiency gains in seller markets can include reductions in the prices concentrated firms pay for animals through their exercise of <b>buyer</b> <b>power.</b> We also raise the question of how <b>buyer</b> <b>power</b> in concentrated retail markets may compound the exercise of <b>buyer</b> <b>power</b> by packers. The paper concludes with a set of recommendations for further research, including the refinement of methodologies for the study of <b>buyer</b> <b>power,</b> and an assessment of proposed new USDA regulations on packer buying practices. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study a farmer-processor relationship, where market power is bidirectional: {{processors}} have buyer {{as well as}} seller market power. Farmers supply a homogeneous raw input to the processors, which, in turn, process it into a horizontally differentiated product. The analysis shows that the spread between prices that both parties receive can be decomposed into two components: one due to <b>buyer</b> market <b>power</b> in the agricultural input market and one due to seller market power in the differentiated processed market. Farmers receive a decreasing dollar share of the final price as concentration in the processed good market increases. On the other hand, the price spread due to processors' <b>buyer</b> (seller) market <b>power</b> decreases (increases) when farmers' transportation costs shrink and when consumers' strength for brand preference increases. We also examine welfare: while the surplus of farmers serving a specific processor is adversely affected in a more concentrated processed good market, the total surplus of farmers serving all processors is independent of the industry concentration. In addition, consumers are worse off when the processed good market is more concentrated and farmers' transportation costs are larger. While stronger brand preference implies a larger "travel cost" for consumers, it may encourage more processors to join the market and provide more varieties. <b>buyer</b> market <b>power,</b> horizontal differentiation, Agribusiness, Industrial Organization, Marketing, D 43, L 13, M 31, Q 13,...|$|R
