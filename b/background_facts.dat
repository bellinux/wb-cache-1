[...] In one final video he stated that one of his greatest pleasures was watching his female partners have orgasms. Episodes had a fairly standard format: A short interview with the female performer to establish some <b>background</b> <b>facts.</b> Whether these were somewhat fictionalized or not, the chat established the young lady as an individual. Then came a succession of sex acts, each with the female performer an avid participant, including in almost every case, her orgasm.

5000|$|FTT was {{initially}} {{proposed in the}} 1990s {{as an attempt to}} unify findings from the memory and reasoning domains that could not be predicted or explained by earlier approaches to cognition and its development (e.g., constructivism [...] and information processing). One of such challenges was the statistical independence between memory and reasoning, that is, memory for <b>background</b> <b>facts</b> of problem situations is often unrelated to accuracy in reasoning tasks. Such findings called for a rethinking of the memory-reasoning relation, which in FTT took the form of a dual-process theory linking basic concepts from psycholinguistic and Gestalt theory to memory and reasoning. More specifically, FTT posits that people form two types of mental representations about a past event, called verbatim and gist traces. Gist traces are fuzzy representations of a past event (e.g., its bottom-line meaning), hence the name fuzzy-trace theory, whereas verbatim traces are detailed representations of a past event. Although people are capable of processing both verbatim and gist information, they prefer to reason with gist traces rather than verbatim. This implies, for example, that even if people are capable of understanding ratio concepts like probabilities and prevalence rates, which are the standard for the presentation of health- and risk-related data, their choice in decision situations will usually be governed by the bottom-line meaning of it (e.g., [...] "the risk is high" [...] or [...] "the risk is low"; [...] "the outcome is bad" [...] or [...] "the outcome is good") rather than the actual numbers. More importantly, in FTT, memory-reasoning independence can be explained in terms of preferred modes of processing when one performs a memory task (e.g., retrieval of verbatim traces) relative to when one performs a reasoning task (e.g., preference for reasoning with gist traces).|$|E

But his views on love were never explicitly expressed in his other four novels except the Ni An. An important <b>background</b> <b>fact</b> is that Modern View of Love by Kuriyagawa Hakuson was very popular in Japan when he was writing this article. Though both of them prioritized love, TaoJingsun was consistent in insisting that traditional Plato's dualism between body and soul was very different from the pursuit of harmonious combination of minds and bodies by Kuriyagawa. To interpret Ni An in this paper, we can find his view of love is Platonic love, and further it's closely related to his growing experience in Japan...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) {{has been}} shown to be a viable {{approach}} to many problems in multi-relational data mining (e. g. bioinformatics). Link discovery (LD) is an important task in data min-ing for counter-terrorism and is the focus of DARPA's program on Ev-idence Extraction and Link Discovery (EELD). Learning patterns for LD is a novel problem in relational data mining that is characterized by having an unprecedented number of <b>background</b> <b>facts.</b> As a result of the explosion in <b>background</b> <b>facts,</b> the eÆciency of existing ILP al-gorithms becomes a serious limitation. This paper presents a new ILP algorithm that integrates top-down and bottom-up search in order to reduce search when processing large examples.
