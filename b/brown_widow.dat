5|$|The Girl {{made its}} {{television}} {{debut in the}} United States on 20 October 2012 on HBO and aired in the United Kingdom on BBC Two on 26 December. Jones and Miller were nominated for awards at the 2013 Golden Globe Awards and the British Academy Television Awards for their roles in the film, which received mixed reviews from critics. The Daily Mirror Jane Simon praised Miller's portrayal of Hedren. Although she endorsed the film, Hedren said its length kept it from showing some of {{the positive aspects of}} her relationship with Hitchcock. Others who knew (and worked with) Hitchcock criticised the film because of its portrayal of him as a sexual predator. Kim Novak (who starred in one of Hitchcock's films) and Nora <b>Brown</b> (<b>widow</b> of one of Hitchcock's close friends) disputed the film's version of events.|$|E
5|$|Although the 'kātĕpo' was {{reported}} to the Linnean Society as early as 1855, the spider was formally described as Latrodectus katipo by L. Powell in 1870. Spiders of the genus Latrodectus have a worldwide distribution and include all of the commonly known widow spiders: the North American black widow spider (Latrodectus mactans), the <b>brown</b> <b>widow</b> (Latrodectus geometricus), and the European black widow (Latrodectus tredecimguttatus). The katipo's closest relative is the Australian redback spider (Latrodectus hasseltii) Latrodectus katipo and L. atritus (black katipo) were previously thought to be two separate species, but {{research has shown that}} they are a single species, L. katipo, with colour variation that is clinal over latitude and correlated with mean annual temperature. The katipo is so closely related to the redback that it was at one stage thought to be a subspecies, with the proposed name Latrodectus hasseltii katipo. Further research has shown that the katipo is distinct from the redback, having slight structural differences and striking differences in habitat preference, and it remains its own species. The katipo's family Theridiidae has a large number of species both in New Zealand and worldwide and are commonly known as tangle-web spiders, cobweb spiders or comb-footed spiders.|$|E
25|$|Venomous spiders in California include Arizona recluse, baja recluse, chilean recluse, desert recluse, martha's recluse, russell's recluse, <b>brown</b> <b>widow</b> {{and western}} black widow.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>widows</b> can {{be located}} by finding their egg sacs, which are easily identifiable. They {{resemble}} a sandspur, having pointed projections all over, {{and they are}} sometimes described as [...] "tufted", [...] "fluffy", or [...] "spiky" [...] in appearance. Eggs hatch in approximately 20days. Female <b>brown</b> <b>widows</b> [...] "lay about 120-150 eggs per sac and can make 20 egg sacs over a lifetime." ...|$|R
25|$|L. geometricus is {{slightly}} smaller and generally lighter in color than the black widow species; the color {{can range from}} tan to dark brown to black, with shades of grey also possible. Like the black widow species in the United States, L. geometricus has a prominent hourglass-shaped marking {{on the underside of}} the abdomen; the <b>brown</b> <b>widow's</b> hourglass, however, is usually a vivid orange or a yellowish color. Unlike the black widow, L. geometricus has a black-and-white geometric pattern on the dorsal side of its abdomen. Although the Latin name comes from this pattern, a spider's coloring can and does darken over time and the pattern may become obscured. Also, they have stripes on their legs. <b>Brown</b> <b>widows</b> are often preyed on by mud daubers and sometimes by digger wasps.|$|R
5000|$|L. bishopi is {{believed}} to be venomous like the other Latrodectus members, though no bites by this spider are recorded in the medical literature; unlike cosmopolitan species such as the black and <b>brown</b> <b>widows,</b> it seldom comes into contact with humans. The [...] has been measured in mice as 2.20 mg/kg (with a confidence interval of 1.29-3.74), and each spider contains about 0.157 mg.|$|R
25|$|Furthermore, in 2012, {{researchers}} {{published a}} paper {{suggesting that the}} black widow's close relative, the <b>brown</b> <b>widow,</b> may be competing for territory with, and ultimately displacing black widows in Southern California.|$|E
25|$|As of 2012, {{researchers}} at the University of California, Riverside, suggested that the <b>brown</b> <b>widow</b> spider, newly established in Southern California, {{may in fact be}} displacing black widow spiders from the region, competing and/or fighting for territory. While certainly not definitive, this evidence does suggest that the <b>brown</b> <b>widow</b> is likely to be more hostile and aggressive towards its relative, the black widow, than the black widow is towards it. If that proves to be true, humans may be positively affected because, over time, brown widows will aggressively eradicate and replace the black widows from the areas they inhabit, and since brown widows are less venomous than black widows, this may have the effect of making those areas safer.|$|E
25|$|Like all Latrodectus species, L.geometricus has a {{neurotoxic}} venom. The venom acts on {{nerve endings}} causing the very unpleasant symptoms of latrodectism. However, <b>brown</b> <b>widow</b> bites {{are usually not}} very dangerous; usually much less dangerous than those of L.mactans, the black widow. The effects of the toxin are usually confined to the bite area and surrounding tissue, unlike the black widow's. Mere toxicity of the venom {{is not the only}} factor in dangerousness. <b>Brown</b> <b>widow</b> bites are minor compared to black widow bites because they cannot deliver the same amount of venom as the black widow. The LD50 of L. geometricus venom has been measured in mice as 0.43mg/kg, and separately again as 0.43mg/kg (with a 95% confidence interval of 0.31-0.53).|$|E

25|$|Latrodectus geometricus, {{commonly}} known as the <b>brown</b> <b>widow,</b> brown button spider, grey widow, brown black widow, house button spider or geometric button spider, is one of the widow spiders in the genus Latrodectus. As such, it is a 'cousin' to the more infamous Latrodectus mactans (black widow).|$|E

Represented species include leafcutter ant, flower mantis, Vietnamese walking stick, Atlas beetle, American burying beetle, sunburst diving beetle, water scorpion, <b>brown</b> <b>widow</b> spider, brown recluse spider, yellow garden spiders, Platymeris biguttatus, cobalt blue tarantula, Texas brown tarantula, and Egyptian fattail scorpion.|$|E
25|$|L. geometricus {{is found}} {{in many parts of}} the world (including in the United States where it is known as the <b>brown</b> <b>widow</b> spider); it is unknown where this species' origins are. L. rhodesienses is native to Africa. Both brown button species have the famed {{hourglass}} markings of the black widow on their abdomens, but are generally lighter in color. The brown button spiders' venom is less toxic to humans than the venom of the black buttons.|$|E

5000|$|Brown was the {{daughter}} of Emmeline V. <b>Brown,</b> a <b>widow</b> who supported her children as a dressmaker in Georgetown. The young Brown was a star student of Myrtilla Miner, an abolitionist who ran a school for black girls in the virulently proslavery Washington region. Brown was often frustrated with Miner's open condescension toward her black charges. But she supported Miner's overall mission: In the late 1850s, Brown briefly taught at the school alongside Emily Howland. She and Howland became longtime friends and correspondents.|$|R
25|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>widow</b> has a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution. It is thought by some researchers to originate in South Africa, {{although this is}} uncertain, as specimens were discovered in both Africa and South America. They are usually found around buildings in tropical areas. They can compete with populations of the black widow spider. It is found {{in many areas of}} South Africa, the United States (including Hawaii), Australia, Afghanistan, China, Japan, Dominican Republic, Cyprus, Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Brazil, and there have been sightings in the United Arab Emirates, Pakistan, India (Ahmedabad) and Thailand.|$|E
500|$|Nora <b>Brown</b> (<b>widow</b> of James H. Brown, first {{assistant}} director on The Birds and Marnie, who knew Hitchcock for several years) {{said that her}} husband would not have endorsed The Girls interpretation of events and the film's portrayal of Hitchcock would have saddened him. Gwyneth Hughes interviewed James Brown {{as part of her}} background research for the film, but he died before the film was completed. In October 2012, Nora Brown told The Daily Telegraph that she had written to Hughes expressing her anger. Hughes has said that James H. Brown backed up Hedren's claims of sexual harassment. Tony Lee Moral, author of two books about the making of the Hitchcock films in which Hedren starred, echoed Brown's comments. Writing for Broadcast in December 2012, Moral (who interviewed Jim Brown at length for his 2013 book, The Making of Hitchcock's The Birds) recalled a remark Brown made about Hitchcock. [...] "Some {{of the things that are}} expressed about [...] are highly over exaggerated. I think Hitch became upset because he thought Tippi wasn't fulfilling the star quality that he thought she had or was looking for." ...|$|E

50|$|One of the {{founding}} members of the Institute was a printer and typographer named Joseph Guibord. In 1869, Guibord died. Bourget refused to let Henrietta <b>Brown,</b> Guibord's <b>widow,</b> bury her husband's remains in the Catholic section of the Côte-des-Neiges cemetery {{because he was a}} member of the Institute. The widow did not accept the decision and decided to bring the case to court. Henrietta Brown's lawyer, Joseph Doutre, also a member of the Institute, ultimately won his case before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, at that time the court of last resort for the British Empire, on November 21, 1874. The Guibord case became a point of great political and religious controversy.|$|R
50|$|It {{was also}} very nearly {{the site of an}} {{official}} residence of the mayor of Washington, D.C., in 2001 when Betty <b>Brown</b> Casey, <b>widow</b> of millionaire Maryland real estate developer Eugene B. Casey, donated 17 acre of land at 1801 Foxhall Road to the city for the purpose of a mayoral mansion. However, the city was bogged down for nearly a year in attempting to purchase adjacent land from the National Park Service; additionally, many vocal city activists and residents felt that for a city marked by increasing gentrification and socioeconomic diversity, building a mayoral residence in such a wealthy enclave sent a bad message. The city ultimately gave up on the project in 2003 and ceded the land to the Salvation Army.|$|R
