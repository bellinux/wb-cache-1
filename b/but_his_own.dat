25|$|One of {{the first}} such moves {{involved}} the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee affair that commenced in October 1946 and {{eventually led to the}} murder of Solomon Mikhoels and the arrest of many other members.

25|$|Edwards {{may have}} {{committed}} other murders, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> account was inconsistent; while in prison {{he claimed to}} have killed 18 children, but {{in an interview with the}} Los Angeles Times he said the number was only six. The twelve-year interval between the disappearance of Baker and Howell, and the shooting of Rochet, led investigators to suspect Edwards may have committed similar crimes during that time.|$|E

25|$|After {{initially}} {{entering the}} church and becoming a cardinal on his father's election to the Papacy, {{he became the first}} person to resign a cardinalcy {{after the death of his}} brother in 1498. His father set him up as a prince with territory carved from the Papal States, but after his father's death he was unable to retain power for long. According to Machiavelli this was not due to his lack of planning for all possibilities, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> illness.|$|E
25|$|From 1920, Sanielevici was an {{isolated}} {{figure on the}} left, editing {{a new version of}} Curentul Nou and only affiliating with the popular daily Adevărul. He moved away from literary theory and, following his anthropological speculations, revived Lamarckism and scientific racism to formulate his own racial-sociological system. Himself a Jewish Romanian, Sanielevici attempted to undermine the racial assumptions of Nazi ideologists and local fascists, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> interpretations of natural history were universally ridiculed. Sanielevici placed human nutrition and mastication at the core of racial distinctions, and went on to stratify artistic temperaments into racial clusters.|$|E
25|$|The posthumous second series, {{edited by}} Jeanne de Salzmann is titled Meetings with Remarkable Men(1963) and {{is written in}} a {{seemingly}} accessible manner as a memoir of his early years, but also contains some 'Arabian Nights' embellishments and allegorical statements. His posthumous Third Series, written as if unfinished and also edited by Jeanne de Salzmann (Life Is Real Only Then, When 'I Am') contains an intimate account of Gurdjieff's inner struggles during his later years, as well as transcripts {{of some of his}} lectures. There is an enormous and growing amount written about Gurdjieff's ideas and methods <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> challenging writings remain the primary sources.|$|E

25|$|It is {{thereafter}} {{revealed that}} Roose Bolton engineered the defeat at Duskendale by sending Robb's soldiers {{into a trap}} set by the Lannisters, while holding his own forces in reserve, and arranging that all <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> forces would be slaughtered in rearguard. The combined effect was to kill off the forces of other Northern houses loyal to Robb while leaving the Bolton army unscathed. Tywin Lannister (the King's Hand and grandfather) rewards Roose by naming House Bolton the Great House of the North, in place of House Stark. The crown also legitimizes Roose's bastard son Ramsay Snow as a Bolton and the new Lord of Winterfell.|$|E
25|$|Doom’s honor code {{led him to}} save Captain America from {{drowning}} because Captain America {{had earlier}} saved his life, and on another occasion he thanked Spider-Man for saving him from terrorists attacking him in an airport by allowing him to leave alive despite Spider-Man subsequently insulting him. His code of honor also means {{that he will not}} attack a respected opponent who is weakened or at a severe disadvantage, as he regards any victory resulting from such circumstances as hollow and meaningless. He has even on several occasions battled opponents who were intent on killing the Fantastic Four, {{for no other reason than}} the fact that he does not want the ultimate defeat of the Fantastic Four to come from anyone’s hands <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>own.</b>|$|E
25|$|He sang {{well-known}} theme {{songs for}} many movie Western soundtracks, including , Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, and Blazing Saddles, {{although he was}} not a country & western singer. Laine sang an eclectic variety of song styles and genres, stretching from big band crooning to pop, western-themed songs, gospel, rock, folk, jazz, and blues. He did not sing the soundtrack song for High Noon, which was sung by Tex Ritter, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> version (with somewhat altered lyrics, omitting the name of the antagonist, Frank Miller) was the one that became a bigger hit, nor did he sing the theme to another show he is commonly associated with—Champion the Wonder Horse (sung by Mike Stewart)—but released his own, subsequently more popular, version.|$|E

25|$|Conrad's brother Boniface was {{the leader}} of the Fourth Crusade and a notable patron of troubadours, as was their sister Azalaïs, Marchioness of Saluzzo. Their {{youngest}} brother Renier was a son-in-law of Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus, and the eldest, William, had been the first husband of Sibylla and father of Baldwin V of Jerusalem. Conrad was also briefly Marquis of Montferrat, following his father's death in 1191. In Montferrat he was succeeded by Boniface, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> heiress was born posthumously: a daughter Maria of Montferrat, 'La Marquise', who in 1205 became Queen of Jerusalem on Isabella's death, but died young in childbirth. Conrad's ex-wife, Theodora, was still living in the mid-late 1190s, when she was having the monastery of Dalmatios converted into a convent, possibly for her own residence.|$|E
25|$|This version's major {{difference}} is Brainiac's role in Krypton's destruction. Brainiac {{is portrayed as}} the supercomputer that monitors Krypton and advises the planetary council on scientific matters. He senses the imminent destruction of the planet, but denies it so he can avoid the council's order to organize the planet's evacuation and instead focus on saving himself. Brainiac reasons {{that the loss of}} the planet itself and all its living inhabitants is part of the natural order, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> survival would ensure the preservation of Krypton's history and achievements. Because he goes against Brainiac and the Kryptonian Council, Jor-El becomes an outlaw in their eyes as he works to save his son. After the destruction of Krypton and Kal-El's arrival on Earth, Brainiac eventually becomes an enemy of Superman.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the 1977 season, the Warwickshire captain, David Brown, {{retired from}} {{full-time}} cricket and Whitehouse was picked to replace him. It was a difficult time for Warwickshire as several established players had retired and others, including the England Test player Dennis Amiss, were involved in the World Series Cricket breakaway group, and feelings within Warwickshire particularly ran high about their continued involvement in domestic cricket. Whitehouse won praise for steering the cricket team through these difficulties, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> form suffered and in neither 1978 nor 1979, the years of his captaincy, did he maintain his batting form: he failed to score 1000 runs in both seasons, and his average was barely above 20. He resigned from the captaincy after the 1979 season and returned to his best form in the 10 matches he played in 1980; these included the County Championship match against Glamorgan in which he finally beat his debut score of 1971 by making a second innings 197 to save the match. At {{the end of the}} 1980 season he retired from first-class and List A cricket.|$|E
