This paper shows that option positions with implicit borrowing—such as put sales and call purchases—are tax-disadvantaged relative to the equivalent synthetic option with explicit borrowing. Conversely, option positions with implicit lending—such as warrants—are tax-advantaged. I also show that firms are better off from a tax perspective issuing bifurcated convertible bonds—bonds plus warrants—rather than an otherwise equivalent standard convertible...|$|R

50|$|Most {{public offerings}} {{are in the}} primary market, that is, the issuing company itself is the offerer of {{securities}} to the public. The offered securities are then issued (allocated, allotted) to the new owners. If it is an offering of shares, {{this means that the}} company's outstanding capital grows. If it is an offering of other securities, this entails the creation or expansion of a series (of <b>bonds,</b> <b>warrants,</b> etc.). However, more rarely, public offerings take place in the secondary market. This is called a secondary market offering: existing security holders offer to sell their stake to other, new owners, through the stock exchange. The offerer is different from the issuer (the company). A secondary market offering is still a public offering with much the same requirements, including a prospectus.|$|R

30|$|A {{key feature}} of the {{chemical}} structure of wool keratin proteins is their high cystine content. These amino acids with disulfide cross-links are important for the structural integrity of the fibres [5, 6]. Weaker hydrogen bonds and salt bridges between COO− and NH 3 + ions also influence the structural properties of wool. In the assessment of wool degradation, the integrity of protein backbone and crosslinks are the “main chemical entities of interest” as noted by Weatherall [7]. For this reason, the cystine breakdown products formed from scission of disulfide <b>bonds</b> <b>warrant</b> study for historic tapestries and were investigated in this research. The intramolecular and intermolecular disulfide network is a significant component of the wool keratin cellular substructure [8].

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} use of public debt {{mezzanine}} instruments, which include participating bonds, subordinated bonds, convertible bonds and <b>bonds</b> with <b>warrants,</b> by non-financial corporations and financial corporations in the Czech Republic. It aims to analyse and evaluate use of mezzanine financing instruments {{in the form of}} public debt mezzanine by selected economic entities in the Czech Republic in 2006 – 2012, and identify factors affecting the scope of their utilization. The performed research implies that public debt mezzanine instruments are used in the Czech Republic marginally only. Within the monitored period, these instruments were issued in the total volume of CZK 13. 43 bn (i. e. about EUR 0. 49 bn), where subordinated bonds got a share of CZK 13. 26 bn (i. e. about EUR 0. 48 bn). The share of newly issued public debt mezzanine instruments in the total financial sources of non-financial corporations and financial corporations within the monitored period was on the top in 2009, when it amounted to 0. 08 %. Wider utilization of public debt mezzanine instruments is particularly prevented by the fact that potential issuers are afraid of high costs relating to the process of issuance, but also to the life cycle of such an issue, and they are also afraid of lack of interest of investors (in the case of subordinated bonds and participating bonds), the owners’ fear of extension of control (in the case of convertible bonds and <b>bonds</b> with <b>warrants),</b> or {{the fact that it is}} difficult to estimate the cost of capital (in the case of participating bonds) ...|$|R

In these circumstances, even the well managed and highly profitable businesses have limited options for financing growth or strengthening their equity resources. In these conditions, alternative forms of financing such as mezzanine finance {{are becoming more and more}} a supplement to the traditional forms of corporate financing. Mezzanine is a type of financing that combines elements of debt and equity financing, a hybrid construct that makes use of various longstanding instruments. The most important mezzanine financing instruments include: subordinated loans, participating loans, profit participation rights, convertible bonds and <b>bonds</b> with <b>warrants.</b> A common feature of the various instruments is that they can be structured flexibly in many different forms in order to provide solutions for the specific financing requirements of private and listed companies.
