5|$|The {{chemical}} {{reacts with}} moisture {{on the skin}} and in the eyes, causing a <b>burning</b> <b>sensation</b> and the immediate forceful and uncontrollable shutting of the eyes. Effects usually include tears streaming from the eyes, profuse coughing, exceptional nasal discharge that is full of mucus, burning in the eyes, eyelids, nose and throat areas, disorientation, dizziness and restricted breathing. It will also burn the skin where sweaty and/or sunburned. In highly concentrated doses it can also induce severe coughing and vomiting. Almost all of the immediate effects wear off within an hour (such as exceptional nasal discharge and profuse coughing), although the feeling of burning and highly irritated skin may persist for hours. Affected clothing {{will need to be}} washed several times or thrown away.|$|E
5|$|The {{clinical}} features of latrodectism are similar for all species of Latrodectus spiders and is generally characterised by extreme pain. Initially, the bite may be painful, but sometimes only {{feels like a}} pin prick or mild <b>burning</b> <b>sensation.</b> Within an hour victims generally develop more severe local pain with local sweating and sometimes piloerection (goosebumps). Pain, swelling and redness spread proximally from the site. Less commonly, systemic envenoming is heralded by swollen or tender regional lymph nodes; associated features include malaise, nausea, vomiting, abdominal or chest pain, generalised sweating, headache, fever, hypertension and tremor. Rare complications include seizure, coma, pulmonary edema, respiratory failure or localised skin infection. The duration of effects can range from {{a few hours to}} days, with severe pain persisting for over 24 hours after being bitten in some cases.|$|E

25|$|There {{are usually}} no {{symptoms}} {{other than the}} unusual appearance of the tongue, {{but in some cases}} persons may experience pain or burning e.g. when eating hot, acidic, spicy or other kinds of foods (e.g. cheese, tomatoes, fruit).

25|$|The {{fruit of}} most species of Capsicum {{contains}} capsaicin (methyl-n-vanillyl nonenamide), a lipophilic chemical {{that can produce}} a strong <b>burning</b> <b>sensation</b> (pungency or spiciness) {{in the mouth of}} the unaccustomed eater. Most mammals find this unpleasant, whereas birds are unaffected. The secretion of capsaicin protects the fruit from consumption by insects and mammals, while the bright colors attract birds that will disperse the seeds.|$|E

Lichen planus, particularly when concomitant oral or genital lesions occur, significantly affects patients’ quality of life.|$|E
25|$|White wine is {{regularly}} {{used as an}} ingredient. Its acidity balances well with fat taking away excess heaviness. This acidity also refines the meat or fish and it helps {{to break down the}} fibres of the meat to make it tender.

The vinegar combines acidity with a <b>burning</b> <b>sensation</b> that gives recipes where it is used a bittersweet side characteristic.|$|E

25|$|Lichen planus (LP) is {{a disease}} {{characterized}} by itchy reddish-purple polygon-shaped skin lesions on the lower back, wrists, and ankles. It may also present with a <b>burning</b> <b>sensation</b> in the mouth, and a lattice-like network of white lines near sites of erosion (Wickham striae).

25|$|Common {{manifestations of}} sensory issues include {{numbness}} or painful sensations {{in the arms}} and legs, abnormal sensations like “pins and needles,” and heat intolerance. Pain experienced by individuals depends on {{the severity of the}} polyneuropathy. It may be dull and constant in some individuals while being sharp and lancinating in others. In many subjects, tenderness is seen upon the palpitation of muscles in the feet and legs. Certain people may also feel cramping sensations in the muscles affected and others say there is a <b>burning</b> <b>sensation</b> in their feet and calves.|$|E

25|$|The {{burning and}} painful sensations {{associated}} with capsaicin result from its chemical interaction with sensory neurons. Capsaicin, {{as a member}} of the vanilloid family, binds to a receptor called the vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (TRPV1). First cloned in 1997, TRPV1 is an ion channel-type receptor. TRPV1, which can also be stimulated with heat, protons and physical abrasion, permits cations to pass through the cell membrane when activated. The resulting depolarization of the neuron stimulates it to signal the brain. By binding to the TRPV1 receptor, the capsaicin molecule produces similar sensations to those of excessive heat or abrasive damage, explaining why the spiciness of capsaicin is described as a <b>burning</b> <b>sensation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Geographic tongue, {{also known}} by several other terms, is an {{inflammatory}} {{condition of the}} mucous membrane of the tongue, usually on the dorsal surface. It is a common condition, affecting approximately 2–3% of the general population. It is characterized by areas of smooth, red depapillation (loss of lingual papillae) which migrate over time. The name comes from the map-like appearance of the tongue, with the patches resembling the islands of an archipelago. The cause is unknown, but the condition is entirely benign (importantly, it does not represent oral cancer), {{and there is no}} curative treatment. Uncommonly, geographic tongue may cause a <b>burning</b> <b>sensation</b> on the tongue, for which various treatments have been described with little formal evidence of efficacy.|$|E

50|$|Symptoms of A. baumannii {{infections in}} turn range from fevers and chills, rash, {{confusion}} and/or altered mental states, pain or <b>burning</b> <b>sensations</b> when urinating, strong urge to urinate frequently, sensitivity to bright light, nausea (with or without vomiting), muscle and chest pains, breathing problems, and cough (with or without yellow, green, or bloody mucus).
