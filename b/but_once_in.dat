5|$|Following an {{avalanche}} at San Carlos Minas in January 1992, Hermética joined a charity music festival {{held at the}} Chateau Carreras stadium. Hermética played only a few songs at a concert with Riffthe headline band, which ended with minor riots. Hermética were the opening act for Black Sabbath at Obras Sanitarias; Black Sabbath's frontman Ronnie James Dio thanked the band for playing with them. The band leased 25% of the copyright of their songs to Daniel Grinbank, the businessman who brought rock bands to Argentina to play with Black Sabbath. In October 1992, they were the supporting band for Motörhead in Obras. They were offered a concert in Paraguay, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> the country the show's producers tried to pay less money than had been agreed. Unable to find an alternative location, the band refused to play and returned to Argentina.|$|E
5|$|In March 1814, {{following}} {{with the}} collapse of the First French Empire, Ferdinand VII was restored to the Spanish throne. This signified an important change, since most of the political and legal changes made on both sides of the Atlantic—the myriad of juntas, the Cortes in Spain and several of the congresses in the Americas, and many of the constitutions and new legal codes—had been made in his name. Before entering Spanish territory, Ferdinand made loose promises to the Cortes that he would uphold the Spanish Constitution. <b>But</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> Spain he realized that he had significant support from conservatives in the general population and the hierarchy of the Spanish Catholic Church; so, on May 4, he repudiated the Constitution and ordered the arrest of liberal leaders on May 10. Ferdinand justified his actions by stating that the Constitution and other changes had been made by a Cortes assembled in his absence and without his consent. He restored the former legal codes and political institutions and promised to convene a new Cortes under its traditional form (with separate chambers for the clergy and the nobility), a promise never fulfilled. News of the events arrived through Spanish America during the next three weeks to nine months, depending on time it took goods and people to travel from Spain.|$|E

25|$|American {{labor leaders}} were {{initially}} happy with Brennan's appointment. Brennan was an outspoken advocate {{for a higher}} minimum wage, expanding the minimum wage to cover more workers, significant improvement in unemployment benefits, enhanced workplace safety, and worker training programs. <b>But</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> office, Brennan promoted a plan which would raise the minimum wages in small increments over four years with no {{increase in the number}} of covered workers. George Meany, the president of the AFL-CIO, was outraged and rarely mentioned Brennan's name or spoke to him again during Brennan's tenure in office.|$|E

25|$|Napoleon's {{original}} plan for 16 June {{was based on}} the assumption that the Coalition forces, who had been caught napping, would not attempt a risky forward concentration; and he intended therefore to push an advance guard as far as Gembloux, for the purpose of feeling for and warding off Blücher. To assist this operation the reserve would move at first to Fleurus to reinforce Grouchy, should he need assistance in driving back Blücher's troops; <b>but,</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> possession of Sombreffe, Napoleon would swing the reserve westwards and join Ney, who, it was supposed, would have in the meantime mastered Quatre Bras.|$|E
25|$|Kersaudy {{describes}} the events which then followed as: “On {{the morning of}} 9 April, however, the General obstinately refused to take the alert seriously {{and it was only}} with the greatest difficulty that the officer on duty at headquarters could prevail on him to leave his country home and return to Oslo. <b>But</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> Oslo, the General called the Minister of Defence and advised him to mobilize the four brigades stationed in southern Norway…” Sadly the mobilization plan for a partial mobilization at the time relied on the post office to order these brigades to mobilize, with an inherent delay of several days.|$|E
25|$|Judah possessed {{such great}} zeal for {{learning}} and such tireless energy that he even omitted daily prayer {{in order to secure}} more time for study, and prayed <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> thirty days (R. H. 35a). This diligence, together with a remarkably retentive memory, made it possible for him to collect and transmit the greater part of Rav's, as well as many of Samuel's, sayings; the Talmud contains about four hundred haggadic and halakic sayings by the former, and many by the latter, all recorded by Judah b. Ezekiel, while a number of other sayings of Rav's that occur in the Talmud without the name of the transmitter likewise were handed down by Judah (Rashi to Ḥul. 44a).|$|E

25|$|After this, Napoleon gave Spain to {{his brother}} Joseph Bonaparte and forced the Royal family into exile in Fontainebleau. Maria Luisa {{requested}} a separate residence and moved with her children to a house in Passy, but was soon moved to Compiegne on June 18. She was plagued by frequent sickness and shortage of money and, not owning any horses, was forced to walk wherever she needed to go. When at last Napoleon sent 12,000 francs as the promised compensation, the expenses of her trip to France were discounted. She wrote a letter of protest, saying that prisoners were never made {{to pay for their}} removal, but she was advised not to send it out. She was promised to retire to the Palace of Colorno in Parma with a substantial allowance, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> Lyon, under the pretext of conducting her to her destination, she was escorted to Nice, where she was kept under strict vigilance.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Festubert {{began on}} 15 May, and on 25 May the 47th Division {{extended}} the British offensive by launching an attack from Givenchy {{just north of}} the La Bassée Canal. 6th London Brigade (now entitled 142nd (1/6th London) Bde), was chosen to make the attack on a two-battalion front by the 1/23rd and 1/24th Londons, with the 1/21st in support. The brigade was harassed by artillery and machine-gun fire (during the Battle of Aubers) {{in the days before the}} attack, which went in at 18.30 on the 25th, against German trenches known as the 'S' Bend. The leading battalions swept across No-Man's Land with comparatively small losses, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> the German front-line trench came under fierce enfilading fire from German guns that had pre-registered their own trenches. The lead companies of the First Surreys (B and D), waiting in the British front trenches, were also heavily shelled, and then met with intense small-arms fire when they crossed No-Man's Land to support the attack. They then had to put the captured trenches into a defensible state to ward off counter-attacks, while A and C companies brought up supplies, evacuated wounded, and dug a communication trench from the old front line during the night. Daybreak on 26 May revealed that the left flank of the battalion was 'in the air', with a party of Germans behind it still inflicting casualties. It took all day to fortify this flank and build up parapets that could be handed over to the relieving battalion that night. The First Surreys lost two officers and 32 NCOs and men killed in this action, and three officers and 120 NCOs wounded, and won the battle honour Festubert 1915.|$|E

500|$|As regimental {{structures}} developed many units selected horses {{of uniform}} type and some, {{such as the}} Royal Scots Greys, even specified colour. Trumpeters often rode distinctive horses so they stood out. Regional armies developed type preferences, such as British hunters, Hanoverians in central Europe, and steppe ponies of the Cossacks, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> the field, the lack of supplies typical of wartime meant that horses of all types were used. [...] Since horses were such a vital component of most armies in early modern Europe, many instituted state stud farms to breed horses for the military. However, in wartime, supply rarely matched the demand, resulting in some cavalry troops fighting on foot.|$|E
500|$|Swift {{commenced}} composing [...] "White Horse" [...] {{almost a}} year before the release of Fearless, weeks after composing Fearless lead single [...] "Love Story", songs which are quite disparate lyrically. Swift first solely wrote the first verse. She then made a phone call to Liz Rose, co-writer of most tracks on Swift's eponymous debut studio album, Taylor Swift (2006), asking for her aid in finishing the song; the two completed writing the song in approximately forty-five minutes. The song was inspired by a boyfriend of Swift's who she perceived to be a Prince Charming and, in the downfall of the relationship, then realized he was not. She said he was the person who triggered the song, <b>but,</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> the midst of writing it, drifted in direction. It focused on the initial moment where she recognized the relationship was over. She said everything after that particular moment centered on recuperation and, because of that, considered it the most solemn aspect of a breakup: [...] "To me, 'White Horse' is about what, in my opinion, is the most heart-breaking part of a break-up – that moment when you realize that all the dreams you had, all those visions you had of being with this person, all that disappears." [...] About the difference in themes between [...] "White Horse" [...] and [...] "Love Story", Swift explained that in divergent scenarios, she regarded fairytales in different manners. She attributed the fact that because she did not expect to go through the event, then she became more inclined to come in terms with reality.|$|E
