50|$|Euclid also {{pioneered the}} high speed tractor belly dumper. This {{combined}} an off road tractor (with a fifth wheel) {{and a very}} large, up to 100-ton capacity, <b>belly</b> <b>dump</b> trailer. This machine, descended from bottom dump wagons drawn by crawler tractors, discharged its load through longitudinal gates {{in the bottom of}} the trailer. The first such trucks carried 13 cubic yards, but by the early 1960s capacities reached 110 tons.|$|E
50|$|A semi bottom dump or <b>belly</b> <b>dump</b> is a {{3-axle tractor}} pulling a 2-axle trailer with a clam shell type dump gate {{in the belly}} of the trailer. The key {{advantage}} of a semi bottom dump is its ability to lay material in a windrow, a linear heap. In addition, a semi bottom dump is maneuverable in reverse, unlike the double and triple trailer configurations described below. These trailers may be found either of the windrow type shown in the photo, or may be of the cross spread type, with the gate opening front to rear instead of left and right. The cross spread type gate will actually spread the cereal grains fairly and evenly from the width of the trailer. By comparison, the windrow type gate leaves a pile in the middle. The cross spread type gate, on the other hand, tends to jam and may not work very well with coarse materials.|$|E
50|$|Euclid also {{manufactured}} {{wheeled tractor}} scrapers, such as were invented by R. G. LeTourneau (later to become LeTourneau-Westinghouse, after {{the purchase of}} R. G LeTourneau, Inc. by Westinghouse Air Brake Company) and now almost singularly manufactured by Caterpillar. Euclid's tractor scrapers were powered by the same tractors as their <b>belly</b> <b>dumps.</b> Euclid {{was the first major}} manufacturer to commercialize the now ubiquitous articulated rubber tired loader; the mainstay of many heavy equipment manufacturers nowadays, particularly Caterpillar.|$|R
40|$|Earth-moving {{vehicles}} (e. g., <b>dump</b> trucks, <b>belly</b> <b>dumps)</b> commonly haul radiologically contaminated {{materials from}} a site being remediated to a disposal site. Traditionally, each vehicle must be surveyed before being released. The logistical difficulties of implementing {{the traditional approach}} {{on a large scale}} demand that an alternative be devised. A statistical method for assessing product quality from a continuous process was adapted to the vehicle decontamination process. This method produced a sampling scheme that automatically compensates and accommodates fluctuating batch sizes and changing conditions without the need to modify or rectify the sampling scheme in the field. Vehicles are randomly selected (sampled) upon completion of the decontamination process to be surveyed for residual radioactive surface contamination. The frequency of sampling is based on the expected number of vehicles passing through the decontamination process in a given period and the confidence level desired. This process has been successfully used for 1 year at the former uranium millsite in Monticello, Utah (a cleanup site regulated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act). The method forces improvement in the quality of the decontamination process and results in a lower likelihood that vehicles exceeding the surface contamination standards are offered for survey. Implementation of this statistical sampling method on Monticello projects has resulted in more efficient processing of vehicles through decontamination and radiological release, saved hundreds of hours of processing time, provided a high level of confidence that release limits are met, and improved the radiological cleanliness of vehicles leaving the controlled site...|$|R
5000|$|Virginia Bligh, {{the once}} and future Belly Raver, is a survivor. Sold by her parents, {{she was lucky}} to be merely a shill in a pickpocket {{operation}} instead of, say, a worker in a brothel. Lying her way into {{a job as a}} receptionist, she entices Norvell Bligh into marriage, carefully editing her past to elicit sympathy. She then persuades him to adopt her daughter Alexandra, creating a story of an abusive father. Alexandra is well on her way to becoming an obese parasite when Norvell is outfoxed by his subordinate, who is also being manipulated by a <b>Belly</b> Raver, <b>dumping</b> them back into the slum. Virginia kicks Alexandra out, telling her to join a gang and bring in some money. Alexandra joins [...] "Goering's Grenadiers", a group of neo-Nazis. Unfortunately their house is in [...] "Wabbit" [...] territory.|$|R
