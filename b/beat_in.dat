5|$|The orchestral ritornello punctuates the {{movement}} for a third and last time, the upper strings playing the semiquaver figures, with the detached quavers on the <b>beat</b> <b>in</b> the oboes and off the <b>beat</b> <b>in</b> the alto recorders. It leads directly into the homophonic coda {{in the last seven}} bars of {{the movement}}. With the same orchestral pairings as the fugato episode, the sopranos joyously sing out the beginning of the second fugue theme below trilling recorders before joining the polyphony of the other voices—with a last emphatic sospirans figure in the basses—for the final exultant rendition of the text.|$|E

She beat world No. 117, Mariana Duque, in the second round on Centre Court. In the third round, she came from a set down to beat Marina Erakovic to progress to the last 16 where she was beaten by Kaia Kanepi. Her performance pushed her up to 27 in the world, the first Briton in the top 30 since Jo Durie in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{when the}} player confronts an enemy officer, the officer will {{challenge}} {{them to a}} one-on-one duel. If the player accepts, they will be transported to a small arena away from the main battlefield where a one-on-one fight with the officer will take place until either is victorious or time runs out. If the player declines, your morale will drop. If the player wins, their morale will rise and the enemy officer will {{be removed from the}} battlefield. If you accept the officers challenge they do become more difficult to <b>beat</b> <b>in</b> the duel.|$|E

5000|$|If a {{performer}} {{starts with a}} 3 beat and completes these <b>beats</b> <b>in</b> 4 seconds (geometric speed), it is called an [...] "Onnam Kaalam" [...] (ഒന്നാം കാലം) of 3 beats.

5|$|The song uses two-measure phrases that, {{aside from}} the choruses, use a i–III–IV–VI chord progression. The B minor chord is held for 1⅓ of a beat, and a {{relative}} transformation is then used to produce a second-inversion D major chord, which is held for 1⅔ of a <b>beat.</b> <b>In</b> the second measure, a first-inversion E major chord with an added ninth precedes a G major major seventh chord; the chords are held for the same durations as the previous two.|$|E

5|$|Lobates {{have eight}} comb-rows, {{originating}} at the aboral pole and usually not extending beyond {{the body to}} the lobes; in species with (four) auricles, the cilia edging the auricles are extensions of cilia {{in four of the}} comb rows. Most lobates are quite passive when moving through the water, using the cilia on their comb rows for propulsion, although Leucothea has long and active auricles whose movements also contribute to propulsion. Members of the lobate genera Bathocyroe and Ocyropsis can escape from danger by clapping their lobes, so that the jet of expelled water drives them backwards very quickly. Unlike cydippids, the movements of lobates' combs are coordinated by nerves rather than by water disturbances created by the cilia, yet combs on the same row <b>beat</b> <b>in</b> the same Mexican wave style as the mechanically coordinated comb rows of cydippids and beroids. This may have enabled lobates to grow larger than cydippids and to have shapes that are less egg-like.|$|E

5|$|The Rockets have {{developed}} many rivalries within the Western Conference {{ever since the}} team returned there in 1980. Two are intrastate rivalries, with the San Antonio Spurs, who moved along with the Rockets after four years {{with them in the}} Eastern Conference, and the Dallas Mavericks, introduced that very season. Houston faced both Texas teams in playoffs since 1980, beating the Spurs three times and losing once. The Rockets lost twice to the Mavericks, while beating them once. Other famed rivalries were with the Los Angeles Lakers, who in the 1980s Showtime era only missed the NBA Finals when beaten by the Rockets, and the Utah Jazz, who the Rockets <b>beat</b> <b>in</b> both championship seasons but were defeated by Utah in five other occasions.|$|E

5|$|The game's story {{focuses on}} a group of evil creatures called Tikis known as the Tiki Tak Tribe that arrive on Donkey Kong Island, and hypnotize the island's animals to steal Donkey Kong's bananas. This forces him to {{retrieve}} the hoard {{with the help of his}} friend Diddy Kong. Donkey Kong Country Returns was the first traditional home console Donkey Kong game since the release of Donkey Kong Jungle <b>Beat</b> <b>in</b> 2005, and also the first Donkey Kong Country entry not to involve video game developer Rare. The game received critical acclaim, it has sold 6.53 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling games on the Wii. A sequel, , was released for the Wii U in February 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{levels in}} the game consist of galaxies filled with minor planets and worlds, with {{different}} variations of gravity, the central element of gameplay. The concept for the game's use of spherical platforms was first conceptualised from ideas used in Super Mario 128, a technology demonstration shown at Nintendo Space World in 2000. Development of Super Mario Galaxy began {{after the release of}} Donkey Kong Jungle <b>Beat</b> <b>in</b> late 2004, after Shigeru Miyamoto suggested that Nintendo should commission a large-scale Mario game. The game's soundtrack was composed by Mahito Yokota and Koji Kondo, using a symphony orchestra {{for the first time in}} the series.|$|E
5|$|The muscle {{weakness}} and {{increased risk of}} irregular heart <b>beat</b> <b>in</b> TPP result from markedly reduced levels of potassium in the bloodstream. Potassium is not in fact lost from the body, but increased Na+/K+-ATPase activity (the enzyme that moves potassium into cells and keeps sodium in the blood) leads to shift of potassium into tissues, and depletes the circulation. In other types of potassium derangement, the acid-base balance is usually disturbed, with metabolic alkalosis and metabolic acidosis often being present. In TPP, these disturbances are generally absent. Hypokalemia leads to hyperpolarization of muscle cells, making the neuromuscular junction less responsive to normal nerve impulses and leading to decreased contractility of the muscles.|$|E

5|$|Photographer Dick Matthews, {{a friend}} from the Jacaranda, heard about Harry's {{problems}} with Leach and introduced Harry to a local civil servant, Jim Anderson, who lent Harry £50. This enabled Harry to found Mersey <b>Beat</b> <b>in</b> 1961. Harry decided to publish the newspaper every two weeks, covering the music scene in Liverpool, Wirral, Birkenhead, New Brighton, Crosby and Southport, as well as Warrington, Widnes and Runcorn. He thought up the name Mersey Beat by thinking about a policeman's 'beat' (the area of duty), which {{had nothing to do}} with a musical beat. Virginia gave up her accountancy/comptometer operator job at Woolworth's and worked full-time for £2.10/- a week (also contributing a Mersey Roundabout article), while Harry lived on his Senior City Art Scholarship funding. Matthews photographed groups, while Anderson found a small attic office for £5 a week above David Land's wine merchant's shop at 81a Renshaw Street, Liverpool. Anderson and Matthews helped with the move to the new office, with Anderson providing a desk, chair and an Olivetti typewriter.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept for}} Super Mario Galaxys {{gameplay}} originated from ideas taken from Super Mario 128, a technology demonstration shown at Nintendo Space World in 2000 to exemplify the processing {{power of the}} GameCube. The demonstration's director (and future director of Super Mario Galaxy), Yoshiaki Koizumi, desired {{that one of its}} distinguishing features, spherical-based platforms, should be used in a future game, but was held back in belief that such a feature would be impossible for technical reasons. Super Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto suggested to work on the next large-scale Mario game after Nintendo EAD Tokyo finished development on Donkey Kong Jungle <b>Beat</b> <b>in</b> late 2004, pushing for the spherical platform concept to be realised. A prototype of the game's physics system took three months to build, where it was decided that the game's use of spherical platforms would best be suited to planetoids in an outer space environment, with the concept of gravity as a major feature. During development, the designers would often exchange ideas with Miyamoto from his office in Kyoto, where he would make suggestions to the game design. According to Koizumi, many ideas were conceived before development of the Wii console itself begun.|$|E
