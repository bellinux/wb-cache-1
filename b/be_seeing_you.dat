25|$|In 1944, David O. Selznick signed Shirley Temple to a {{four-year}} contract. She appeared in two wartime hits: Since You Went Away and I'll <b>Be</b> <b>Seeing</b> <b>You.</b> Selznick, however, became romantically involved with Jennifer Jones and lost interest in developing Shirley's career. Temple was then lent to other studios. Kiss and Tell, The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer and Fort Apache were her few good films at the time.|$|E
500|$|His next {{match for}} Victoria was against Wally Hammond's English tourists. After {{the fall of}} three early wickets, Harvey joined captain Lindsay Hassett. He {{dominated}} a partnership of 120, making 69 in his second match against the guileful leg spin of Doug Wright. His opponents {{had no doubt that}} he would become a Test player. English wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans congratulated him by proclaiming [...] "We'll <b>be</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> in England next year [...] ". He ended his debut first-class season with 304 runs at 50.66.|$|E
2500|$|Schwahn made Lucas and Peyton's {{love affair}} a {{central theme of}} the show, saying he [...] "designed a world where Peyton and Lucas {{were meant to be}} together" [...] and that [...] "the seeds were planted for [...] to pick Peyton in the pilot– in [...] first episode... When Lucas is at the Rivercourt {{at the end of that}} pilot, you know. I think we feel like this is the girl [...] is his soulmate. And, you know, the pilot ends with him saying, 'I'll <b>be</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, how {{you have}} changed! I've <b>been</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> every day all winter, and never knew you," [...] I said, shaking hands with my old patient, and very glad to see him.|$|R
6000|$|... "If your {{business}} {{with me is}} of any importance," [...] Anna said calmly, [...] "it does not matter in the least about the hour. Have you brought me a message from my sister? I understood, I believe, that she <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> last night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] said Mr. Moulder, {{having become}} very red about the cheeks and chin, [...] "I and this gentleman {{are going to}} have a bit of supper, and it ain't {{accustomed}} to smoke in commercial rooms during meals. You know the rules no doubt if you're commercial yourself;--as I suppose <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> in this room." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1963, Durante {{recorded}} the album of pop standards September Song. The album became a best-seller and provided Durante's re-introduction {{to yet another}} generation, almost three decades later. From the Jimmy Durante's Way of Life album came the gravelly interpretation of the song [...] "As Time Goes By", which accompanied the opening credits of the romantic comedy hit Sleepless in Seattle, while his version of [...] "Make Someone Happy" [...] launched the film's closing credits. Both are included on the film's best-selling soundtrack. Durante also recorded a cover of the well known song I'll <b>Be</b> <b>Seeing</b> <b>You,</b> which became a trademark song on his 60's TV show. This song was also featured in the 2004 film The Notebook.|$|E
6000|$|I assure you, my dear Madam, {{that one}} of the {{greatest}} pleasures I shall have on my return, will <b>be</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you,</b> and that I shall ever be ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] {{the doctor}} said quietly, [...] "just as you like, Ned. I shall <b>be</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> every day, and will give him news of you. I am {{going to see him}} now." ...|$|E
500|$|... Hello, how are you? – I'm doing great, thanks! – It <b>was</b> nice <b>seeing</b> <b>you,</b> but I've got to run! Take care! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And there I {{was while}} you were getting {{yourself}} alone, as you call it, wearing my poor little brains out to think of some story to tell people. I had to stuff them up you had a sprained knee at Chexington, and for all I knew any of them might have <b>been</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> that morning. Besides what has a boy like you to worry about? It's all nonsense, Poff." ...|$|R
60|$|DUKE. Well, well, I must {{go and see}} how Morris <b>is.</b> Pleasure of <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> later.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, Mrs. Soles, but I must {{be getting}} on. We must all look forward to meeting our beloved again, in God's mercy. And {{one of these days}} soon I shall <b>be</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> in church, shan't I." ...|$|E
6000|$|One {{day when}} he was having lunch by himself, and I was waiting on him, he says, raising his glass to his lips, [...] "Well, 'Enery, here's luck to yer! I won't <b>be</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> agen for some time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Entirely," [...] said Mr. Polteed, {{appearing}} suddenly {{between him}} and the door. [...] "I shall <b>be</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> in that other case before long. Good morning, sir." [...] His eyes slid unprofessionally over Soames once more, and he unlocked the door.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then do you hasten on, Edgar. I {{am not in}} {{the least}} afraid. I {{recognize}} now the part of the wood we are in and I can find my way back quite easily. I'll tell my father that we have made it up. I wish I had not kept our meetings so private, for it may vex him a little to know I have <b>been</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you.</b> He <b>is</b> getting old and irritable, that was why I did not. Good-by." ...|$|R
2500|$|My {{greatest}} {{pride and}} pleasure <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> {{as the head}} of the greatest orchestra in Germany. You may remember that I missed almost no performance which you conducted, saw only you and was happy. I believed that what I was hearing emanated from you only...the Ninth Symphony will be forever unforgettable to me on account of you. You appeared to me like a God governing all the powerful elements and working enchantments on men. See, dear Richard, you own the power, the glorious gift of creating something great even as a conductor...|$|R
5000|$|And mentionLot, {{when he said}} to his people, [...] "Do {{you commit}} immorality while <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeing?</b> Do <b>you</b> indeed {{approach}} men with desire instead of women? Rather, you are a people behaving ignorantly." [...] Quran ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'See you! We {{must always}} <b>be</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> of course. Let me think. [...] I've got three weddings and a funeral to-morrow, and Simpson coming about the meeting. Come to luncheon--all of you. Mrs. Fordyce will be delighted, {{and so will}} {{somebody}} else.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Allow me; I have a key. What may I--Oh, it's you!" [...] She turned. Mr. Wagge, in {{professional}} habiliments, was standing there. [...] "Come in; come in," [...] he said. [...] "I was wondering whether perhaps we shouldn't <b>be</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> after what's transpired." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will, if you're in earnest," [...] he answered. [...] "I'll {{give you}} twenty- four hours. Look in to-morrow afternoon, and see Finch. It {{will be for}} the Sunday Post--the Inset. We use {{surfaced}} paper for that and can do you justice. Finch will arrange about the photograph." [...] He held out his hand. [...] "Shall <b>be</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> again," [...] he said.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not the others. They are at Mr. Condamine's, I {{came last}} night--by way of Lescombe. Edda, dear, {{it is all}} right! Oh, I forgot you did not know! There <b>was</b> no <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> before we went away. Ah! by the by, how is my uncle?' ...|$|R
60|$|Your {{despatch}} of to-day received. When I shall wish {{to supersede}} you I {{will let you}} know. All the Cabinet regretted the necessity of arresting, for instance, Vallandigham, some perhaps doubting {{there was a real}} necessity for it; but, being done, all <b>were</b> for <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> through with it.|$|R
50|$|The next day, Scott goes {{to see an}} old {{mercenary}} friend named McCarn (Lee Van Cleef). Scott {{asks him}} if he knows about any ninja activity. However, McCarn tells him, “If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> ninja, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> ghosts.” McCarn tries to recruit Scott to join his cause in eliminating terrorists, but Scott declines.|$|R
6000|$|... "You'm little changed {{these four}} years," [...] {{went on the}} old man, {{in a voice that}} sounded to Stoner as {{something}} in a dream, far away and inconsequent; [...] "but you'll find us a deal changed, you will. There's no one about the place same as when you left; nought but me and your old Aunt. I'll go and tell her that you'm come; she won't <b>be</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you,</b> but she'll let you stay right enough. She always did say if you was to come back you should stay, but she'd never set eyes on you or speak to you again." ...|$|E
6000|$|Many {{experiments}} {{have been made}} in consciously transferring thoughts or emotions from one mind to another. These are very liable to be vitiated by bad observation, collusion and other causes. Meanwhile, intercommunication between mind and mind without the aid of the recognised senses--a supposed process of [...] "telepathy"--is a current explanation of the dreams in which knowledge is obtained that exists in the mind of another person, and of the delusion by virtue of which one person sees another who is perhaps dying, or in some other crisis, at a distance. The idea is popular. A poor Highland woman wrote to her son in Glasgow: [...] "Don't be thinking too much of us, or I shall <b>be</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> some evening in the byre". This is a simple expression of the hypothesis of [...] "telepathy" [...] or [...] "mental telegraphy".|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{want to ask}} any questions," [...] he said, [...] "about my patient. I {{have been}} called in by this Buriat to see a friend of his, {{and it does not}} concern me who or what he may be; but it is {{different}} with you. As a Russian officer I cannot <b>be</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> daily without reporting that I have met a person who scarcely appears to be what he seems. It is painful to me to be obliged to say so. I do not give advice any way. I only say that if you do not wish to be asked questions, it would be best for you to leave here after nightfall; until then, I shall not consider it necessary to make any report. I shall be back again once or twice to-day; you had better think the matter over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But what I {{want to know}} is this: Is it to Senor Perkins that {{we ought}} to <b>be</b> thankful for <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> here at all?" [...] asked Mrs. Markham impatiently.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, how {{can that}} <b>be,</b> your honour, <b>seeing</b> as your name is Kennedy? Though, except for that, you might well <b>be</b> so, <b>seeing</b> that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> so like my master." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A great name, my lord," [...] he said, bowing with grave {{ceremony}} to Wessex, [...] "and one {{familiar to me}} already, though I have not yet <b>been</b> honoured by <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> at Court." ...|$|R
6000|$|The man sat {{silent for}} a time. [...] "No," [...] he said at last, [...] "I thank you all the same. I should like it too, but I don't {{think it would be}} best in the end. Here all my mates live near, and I shall get on in time. The Christmas holiday season will soon be coming on and we shall be up working late. If you were always going to stop at the place you are going to, it would be different; but you will rise, never fear. I shall <b>be</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> in gentleman's clothes again some of these days. I've heard you say you were longing to get your books and to be {{studying}} again, and you'll soon fall into your own ways; but if you will let me, I'll come over sometimes and have a cup of tea and a chat with you. Now, look here, I'm going out with you now, and I'm going to buy you a suit of clothes, something like what you had on when I first saw you. They won't be altogether unsuitable in a shop. This is a loan, mind, and you may pay me off as you get flush." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{arranged}} it all. You'll {{stay here}} this spring, you'll {{come to my}} house on Monday, just as we planned, and later on you may go to Mrs. Case's, if it will make you feel more independent, and do typewriting until the spring term is over. I've told you about my little camp away up in Canada, {{in the heart of the}} wilderness, where I go in summer. We'll stay there until the autumn, until your baby comes, and, after that, I know it won't be difficult to get you a position in the west, where you can gain your living and have your child. I have a good friend in California who I'm sure will help you. And even if your secret should eventually be discovered--which is not probable--you will have earned respect, and society is not as stern as it used to be. And you will always have me for a friend. There, that's the bright side of it. Of course it isn't a bed of roses, but I've lived long enough to observe that the people who lie on roses don't always have the happiest lives. Whenever you want help and advice, I shall always be here, and from time to time I'll <b>be</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you.</b> Isn't that sensible?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear George--I shall <b>be</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> to-morrow, I hope; but I [...] {{think it}} is better, before we meet, to prepare you for a curious [...] {{situation}} that has arisen {{in connection with the}} legacy which [...] your father inherited from your Aunt Emily, and which you are [...] expecting me, as trustee, to hand over to you, now that you have [...] reached your twenty-fifth birthday. You have doubtless heard [...] your father speak of your twin-brother Alfred, who was lost or [...] kidnapped--which, was never ascertained--when you were both [...] babies. When no news was received of him for so many years, it [...] was supposed that he was dead. Yesterday, however, I received a [...] letter purporting that he had been living all this time in Buenos [...] Ayres as the adopted son of a wealthy South American, and has [...] only recently discovered his identity. He states that he is on [...] his way to meet me, and will arrive any day now. Of course, like [...] other claimants, he may prove to be an impostor, but meanwhile [...] his intervention will, I fear, cause a certain delay before I can [...] hand over your money to you. It will be necessary to go into a [...] thorough examination of credentials, etc., and this will take [...] some time. But I will go fully into the matter with you when we [...] meet.--Your affectionate uncle, ...|$|E
60|$|If it weren't for you I couldn't have lived. It <b>was</b> only by <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> that I {{gathered}} {{courage to}} go on with it. And each time I came here I loved you more passionately.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am {{glad you}} think so properly, sir,' {{returned}} Miss Ponsonby. 'Lord Ormersfield seems quite of another opinion. He <b>was</b> desirous of <b>seeing</b> <b>you,</b> Mary; but I have been telling him I could permit no more interviews to-day.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The mater'll be disappointed," [...] Paul said quietly. [...] "She <b>is</b> {{counting}} on <b>seeing</b> <b>you,</b> and it's some time {{since you were}} down, isn't it? Tell you what, old man! I'd try and manage it, if I were you!" ...|$|R
