5|$|The Calcutta High Court is {{the oldest}} High Court in the country, {{established}} on 2 July 1862. High Courts that handle {{a large number of}} cases of a particular region have permanent <b>benches</b> established there. <b>Benches</b> are also present in states which come under the jurisdiction of a court outside its territorial limits. Smaller states with few cases may have circuit <b>benches</b> established. Circuit <b>benches</b> (known as circuit courts {{in some parts of the}} world) are temporary courts which hold proceedings for a few selected months in a year. Thus cases built up during this interim period are judged when the circuit court is in session. According to a study conducted by Bengaluru-based NGO Daksh on 21 high courts in collaboration with Ministry of Law and Justice (India) in March 2016, it was found that average pendency of a case in High courts in India is 3 years.|$|E

5|$|In late July 2006, bus <b>benches</b> {{in several}} Californian cities were {{decorated}} with promotional artwork for Christ Illusion. City officials in Fullerton, California, demanded the artwork be immediately removed from seventeen bus <b>benches</b> located throughout the city, and contacted the hired company which had originally put the adverts {{in place to}} assume the task. The officials disliked the band's name, which they felt referred to a murderer. They also took offense to the antichrist and skull logo adorning the bench artwork.

40|$|Training the <b>bench</b> press {{exercise}} on a traditional flat <b>bench</b> does not induce {{a level of}} instability as seen in sport movements and activities of daily living. Twenty participants were recruited to test two forms of instability: using one dumbbell rather than two and lifting on the COR <b>bench</b> compared to a flat <b>bench.</b> Electromyography (EMG) amplitudes of the pectoralis major, middle trapezius, external oblique, and internal oblique were recorded and compared. Differences in range of motion (ROM) were evaluated by measuring an angular representation of the shoulder complex. Four separate conditions of unilateral <b>bench</b> press were tested while lifting on a: flat <b>bench</b> with one dumbbell, flat <b>bench</b> with two dumbbells, COR <b>Bench</b> with one dumbbell, and COR <b>Bench</b> with two dumbbells. The results imply {{that there are no}} differences in EMG amplitude or ROM between the COR <b>bench</b> and traditional <b>bench.</b> However, greater ROM was found to be utilized in the single dumbbell condition, both in the COR <b>bench</b> and the flat <b>bench...</b>|$|R
5|$|Parents of Amador Valley {{students}} {{became involved}} with student activities. In 1927, Pleasanton mothers decided to start a school lunch program {{to provide students with}} a better environment for learning. Parents donated pots and pans, and a newly hired cook prepared lunches, to be eaten at new tables and <b>benches.</b> The tables and <b>benches</b> were constructed by the custodian and the music teacher from wood of horse stalls formerly on the campus. This project {{led to the formation of}} a Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) chapter at Amador Valley in the late 1920s.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{perforated}} <b>bench</b> {{is to reduce the}} air humidity beneath the plant canopy without excessive energy consumption. A <b>bench</b> heating system with heating pipes under a perforated <b>bench</b> with skirts creates an airflow through the <b>bench</b> openings due to buoyancy forces. Because the heated air is relatively dry compared to the surrounding air, it has a moisture absorbing and transporting capacity. The moisture transporting capacity will be decrease, thereby reducing the advantages of the perforated <b>bench,</b> if airflow rate is impeded by the <b>bench</b> structure, plant shape or leaf area index. Thus the airflow rate is of importance for the performance of a perforated <b>bench.</b> In an experimental setup the airflow rate was determined for different perforated <b>bench</b> designs with and without plants. Measurements were carried out with five different plant types on four <b>bench</b> designs. It was found that the airflow rate was effected by the design of the perforated <b>bench,</b> but on the same type of <b>bench</b> the effect of plant type and leaf area index was insignificant. A model to predict the airflow rate for each <b>bench</b> design as a function of temperature difference created by the <b>bench</b> heating system for the investigated <b>bench</b> designs is presented...|$|R
