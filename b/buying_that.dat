60|$|The latter {{looked at}} him with {{intensified}} interest this morning, in the mood which is altogether peculiar to woman's nature, and which, when reduced into plain words, seems as impossible as the penetrability of matter--that of entertaining a tender pity for the object of her own unnecessary coldness. The imperturbable poise which marked Winterborne in general was enlivened now by a freshness and animation that set a brightness in his eye and on his cheek. Mrs. Melbury asked him to have some breakfast, and he pleasurably replied that he would join them, with his usual lack of tactical observation, not perceiving that they had all finished the meal, that the hour was inconveniently late, and that the note piped by the kettle denoted it to be nearly empty; so that fresh water had to be brought in, trouble taken to make it boil, and a general renovation of the table carried out. Neither did he know, so full was he of his tender ulterior object in <b>buying</b> <b>that</b> horse, how many cups of tea he was gulping down one after another, nor how the morning was slipping, nor how he was keeping the family from dispersing about their duties.|$|E
60|$|At {{the spot}} where she had paused there was a deep bend in the shore, and a small boat with a sail was moored there. In her longing to glide over the waters that were getting golden with the level sun-rays, she thought of a story which {{had been one of}} the things she had loved to dwell on in Boccaccio, when her father fell asleep and she glided from her stool to sit on the floor and read the `Decamerone.' It was the story of that fair Gostanza who in her lovelorn-ness desired to live no longer, but not having the courage to attack her young life, had put herself into a boat and pushed off to sea; then, lying down in the boat, had wrapt her mantle round her head, hoping to be wrecked, so that her fear would be {{helpless}} to flee from death. The memory had remained a mere thought in Romola's mind, without budding into any distinct wish; but now, as she paused again in her walking to and fro, she saw gliding black against the red gold another boat with one man in it, making towards the bend where the first and smaller boat was moored. Walking on again, she at length saw the man land, pull his boat ashore and begin to unload something from it. He was perhaps the owner of the smaller boat also: he would be going away soon, and her opportunity would be gone with him--her opportunity of <b>buying</b> <b>that</b> smaller boat. She had not yet admitted to herself that she meant to use it, but she felt a sudden eagerness to secure the possibility of using it, which disclosed the half-unconscious growth of a thought into a desire.|$|E

6000|$|... "Now we {{must begin}} to see about furniture," [...] Bob Grimstone said. [...] "The best plan, I think, will be for you two to go round of an evening to all the shops in the neighborhood, and mark off just what you think will suit you. You put down the prices stuck on them, and just what they are, and then the missis can go {{in the morning and}} bargain for them. She will get them five shillings in the pound cheaper than you would. It's {{wonderful}} how women do beat men down, to be sure. When a man hears what's the price of a thing he leaves it or takes it just as he likes, but a woman begins by offering half the sum. Then the chap says no, and she makes as if she was going away; he lets her go a little way and then he hollers after her, and comes down a goodish bit in the price. Then she says she don't particularly want it and shouldn't think of giving any such price as that. Then he tries again, and so they gets on till they hit on a figure as suits them both. You see that little tea-caddy in the corner? My wife was just three weeks <b>buying</b> <b>that</b> caddy. The chap wanted seven and six for it, and she offered him half a crown. He came down half a crown {{at the end of the}} first week, and at last she got it for three and nine. Now, the first thing you have got to do is to make out a list. First of all you have got to put down the things as you must have, and then the things you can do without, though you will get them if you can afford it. Mother will help you at that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell the dog," [...] {{said the}} poet to the messenger, [...] "that he who wrote these can write more." [...] But Tonson, {{perfectly}} satisfied with this single triplet, hastened {{to comply with}} the author's request, without requiring any further specimen of his poetical powers. It would seem, however, that when Dryden neglected his stipulated labour, Tonson possessed powers of animadversion, which, though exercised in plain prose, were not a little dreaded by the poet. Lord Bolingbroke, already a votary of the Muses, and admitted to visit their high priest, was wont to relate, that one day he heard another person enter the house. [...] "This," [...] said Dryden, [...] "is Tonson: you will take care not to depart before he goes away: for I have not completed the sheet which I promised him; and if you leave me unprotected, I shall suffer all the rudeness to which his resentment can prompt his tongue."[14] But whatever occasional subjects of dissension arose between Dryden and his bookseller appears always to have brought them together, after the first ebullition of displeasure had subsided. There might, on such occasions, be room for acknowledging faults on both sides; for, if we admit that the bookseller was penurious and churlish, we cannot deny that Dryden seems often to have been abundantly captious, and irascible. Indeed, as the poet placed, and justly, more than a mercantile value upon what he sold, the trader, on his part, was necessarily cautious not to afford a price which his returns could not pay; so that while, in one point of view, the author sold at an inadequate price, the purchaser, in another, really got no more than value for his money. That literature is ill recompensed, is usually rather the fault of the public than the bookseller, whose trade can only exist by <b>buying</b> <b>that</b> which can be sold to advantage. The trader, who purchased the [...] "Paradise Lost" [...] for ten pounds, had probably no very good bargain.[15] ...|$|E

[...] "Not least of our merchant-princes." [...] Dickie, that's me, your dad! [...] I didn't begin with askings. I took my job and I stuck; [...] And I took the chances they wouldn't, an' now they're calling it luck. [...] Lord, what boats I've handled--rotten and leaky and old! [...] Ran 'em, or--opened the bilge-cock, precisely as I was told. [...] Grub that 'ud bind you crazy, and crews that 'ud turn you gray, [...] And a big fat lump of insurance to cover the risk on the way.

[...] Over the world I drove 'em, married at twenty-three, [...] And your mother saving the money and making a man of me. [...] I was content to be master, but she said there was better behind; [...] She took the chances I wouldn't, and I followed your mother blind. [...] She egged me to borrow the money, an' she helped me clear the loan, [...] When we bought half shares in a cheap 'un and hoisted a flag of our [...] own. [...] Patching and coaling on credit, and living the Lord knew how, [...] We started the Red Ox freighters--we've eight-and-thirty now. [...] And those were the days of clippers, and the freights were [...] clipper-freights, [...] And we knew we were making our fortune, but she died in Macassar [...] Straits-- [...] By the Little Paternosters, as you come to the Union Bank-- [...] And we dropped her in fourteen fathom; I pricked it off where she sank. [...] Owners we were, full owners, and the boat was christened for her, [...] And she died out there in childbed. My heart, how young we were! [...] So I went on a spree round Java and well-nigh ran her ashore, [...] But your mother came and warned me and I wouldn't liquor no more. [...] Strict I stuck to my business, afraid to stop or I'd think, [...] Saving the money (she warned me), and letting the other men drink. [...] And I met McCullough in London (I'd saved five 'undred then), [...] And 'tween us we started the Foundry--three forges and twenty men: [...] Cheap repairs for the cheap 'uns. It paid, and the business grew, [...] For I bought me a steam-lathe patent, and that was a gold mine too. [...] "Cheaper to build 'em than buy 'em," [...] I said, but McCullough he shied, [...] And we wasted a year in talking before we moved to the Clyde. [...] And the Lines were all beginning, and we all of us started fair, [...] Building our engines like houses and staying the boilers square. [...] But McCullough 'e wanted cabins with marble and maple and all, [...] And Brussels and Utrecht velvet, and baths and a Social Hall, [...] And pipes for closets all over, and cutting the frames too light. [...] But McCullough he died in the Sixties, and---- Well, I'm dying [...] to-night.... I knew--I knew what was coming, when we bid on the Byfleet's keel. [...] They piddled and piffled with iron: I'd given my orders for steel. [...] Steel and the first expansions. It paid, I tell you, it paid, [...] When we came with our nine-knot freighters and collared the long-run [...] trade. [...] And they asked me how I did it, and I gave 'em the Scripture text, [...] "You keep your light so shining a little in front o' the next!" [...] They copied all they could follow, but they couldn't copy my mind, [...] And I left 'em sweating and stealing {{a year and a half}} behind. [...] Then came the armour-contracts, but that was McCullough's side; [...] He was always best in the Foundry, but better, perhaps, he died. [...] I went through his private papers; the notes was plainer than print; [...] And I'm no fool to finish if a man'll give me a hint. [...] (I remember his widow was angry.) So I saw what the drawings meant, [...] And I started the six-inch rollers, and it paid me sixty per cent. [...] Sixty per cent with failures, and more than twice we could do, [...] And a quarter-million to credit, and I saved it all for you. [...] I thought--it doesn't matter--you seemed to favour your ma, [...] But you're nearer forty than thirty, and I know the kind you are. [...] Harrer an' Trinity College! I ought to ha' sent you to sea-- [...] But I stood you an education, an' what have you done for me? [...] The things I knew was proper you wouldn't thank me to give, [...] And the things I knew was rotten you said was the way to live; [...] For you muddled with books and pictures, an' china an' etchin's an' [...] fans, [...] And your rooms at college was beastly--more like a whore's than a [...] man's-- [...] Till you married that thin-flanked woman, as white and as stale as a [...] bone, [...] And she gave you your social nonsense; but where's that kid o' your [...] own? [...] I've seen your carriages blocking the half of the Cromwell Road, [...] But never the doctor's brougham to help the missus unload.

At sea she had 'em--they died. [...] Only you, an' you stood it; you haven't stood much beside-- [...] Weak, a liar, and idle, and mean as a collier's whelp [...] Nosing for scraps in the galley. No help--my son was no help! [...] So he gets three 'undred thousand, in trust and the interest paid. [...] I wouldn't give it you, Dickie--you see, I made it in trade. [...] You're saved from soiling your fingers, and if you have no child, [...] It all comes back to the business. Gad, won't your wife be wild! [...] Calls and calls in her carriage, her 'andkerchief up to 'er eye: [...] "Daddy! dear daddy's dyin'!" [...] and doing her best to cry. [...] Grateful? Oh, yes, I'm grateful, but keep 'er away from here. [...] Your mother 'ud never ha' stood 'er, and, anyhow, women are queer.... There's women will say I've married a second time. Not quite! [...] But give pore Aggie a hundred, and tell her your lawyers'll fight. [...] She was the best o' the boiling--you'll meet her before it ends; [...] I'm in for a row with the mother--I'll leave you settle my friends: [...] For a man he must go with a woman, which women don't understand-- [...] Or the sort that say they can see it they aren't the marrying brand. [...] But I wanted to speak o' your mother that's Lady Gloster still. [...] I'm going to up and see her, without it's hurting the will. [...] Here! Take your hand off the bell-pull. Five thousand's waiting for [...] you, [...] If you'll only listen a minute, and do as I bid you do. [...] They'll try to prove me a loony, and, if you bungle, they can; [...] And I've only you to trust to! (O God, why ain't he a man?) [...] There's some waste money on marbles, the same as McCullough tried-- [...] Marbles and mausoleums--but I call that sinful pride. [...] There's some ship bodies for burial--we've carried 'em, soldered and [...] packed; [...] Down in their wills they wrote it, and nobody called them cracked. [...] But me--I've too much money, and people might.... All my fault: [...] It come o' hoping for grandsons and <b>buying</b> <b>that</b> Wokin' vault.

[...] I've thought it out on the quiet, the same as it ought to be done-- [...] Quiet, and decent, and proper--an' here's your orders, my son. [...] You know the Line? You don't, though. You write to the Board, and tell [...] Your father's death has upset you an' you're goin' to cruise for a [...] spell, [...] An' you'd like the Mary Gloster--I've held her ready for this-- [...] They'll put her in working order an' you'll take her out as she is. [...] Yes, it was money idle when I patched her and put her aside [...] (Thank God, I can pay for my fancies!)--the boat where your mother [...] died, [...] By the Little Paternosters, as you come to the Union Bank, [...] We dropped her--I think I told you--and I pricked it off where she [...] sank. [...] [Tiny she looked on the grating--that oily, treacly sea--] [...] Hundred and eighteen East, remember, and South just three. [...] Easy bearings to carry--three South--three to the dot; [...] But I gave McAndrews a copy in case of dying--or not. [...] And so you'll write to McAndrews, he's Chief of the Maori Line; [...] They'll give him leave, if you ask 'em and say it's business o' mine. [...] I built three boats for the Maoris, an' very well pleased they were, [...] An' I've known Mac since the Fifties, and Mac knew me--and her.

[...] Stiff-necked Glasgow beggar, I've heard he's prayed for my soul, [...] But he couldn't lie if you paid him, and he'd starve before he stole. [...] He'll take the Mary in ballast--you'll find her a lively ship; [...] And you'll take Sir Anthony Gloster, that goes on his wedding-trip, [...] Lashed in our old deck-cabin with all three port-holes wide, [...] The kick o' the screw beneath him and the round blue seas outside! [...] Sir Anthony Gloster's carriage--our 'ouse-flag flyin' free-- [...] Ten thousand men on the pay-roll and forty freighters at sea! [...] He made himself and a million, but this world is a fleetin' show, [...] And he'll go to the wife of 'is bosom the same as he ought to go. [...] By the heel of the Paternosters--there isn't a chance to mistake-- [...] And Mac'll pay you the money as soon as the bubbles break! [...] Five thousand for six weeks' cruising, the stanchest freighter afloat, [...] And Mac he'll give you your bonus the minute I'm out o' the boat! [...] He'll take you round to Macassar, and you'll come back alone; [...] He knows what I want o' the Mary.... I'll do what I please with my own. [...] Your mother 'ud call it wasteful, but I've seven-and-thirty more; [...] I'll come in my private carriage and bid it wait at the door.... For my son 'e was never a credit: 'e muddled with books and art, [...] And 'e lived on Sir Anthony's money and 'e broke Sir Anthony's heart. [...] There isn't even a grandchild, and the Gloster family's done-- [...] The only one you left me, O mother, the only one! [...] Harrer an' Trinity College! Me slavin' early an' late, [...] An' he thinks I'm dyin' crazy, and you're in Macassar Strait! [...] Flesh o' my flesh, my dearie, for ever an' ever amen, [...] That first stroke come for a warning; I ought to ha' gone to you then, [...] But--cheap repairs for a cheap 'un--the doctors said I'd do: [...] Mary, why didn't you warn me? I've allus heeded to you, [...] Excep'--I know--about women; but you are a spirit now; [...] An', wife, they was only women, and I was a man. That's how. [...] An' a man 'e must go with a woman, as you could not understand; [...] But I never talked 'em secrets. I paid 'em out o' hand. [...] Thank Gawd, I can pay for my fancies! Now what's five thousand to me, [...] For a berth off the Paternosters in the haven where I would be? [...] I believe in the Resurrection, if I read my Bible plain, [...] But I wouldn't trust 'em at Wokin'; we're safer at sea again. [...] For the heart it shall go with the treasure--go down to the sea in [...] ships. [...] I'm sick of the hired women--I'll kiss my girl on her lips!
