5|$|During {{the wartime}} years, Canadian apparel {{manufacturers}} {{were subject to}} quotas on materials. Elastics were unavailable, affecting the comfort and design of women's underwear.

5|$|A visibly {{pregnant}} McMahon also returned on the March 6, 2006 {{episode of}} Raw, approaching Shawn Michaels backstage and {{claiming to have}} abdominal pains. When Michaels left to get her some water, McMahon pulled out an unmarked substance out of her <b>brassiere</b> and poured it into his bottle of water. This substance caused him to become groggy during his match against Shane later in the night, which he lost as a result. McMahon also appeared at the WWE Hall of Fame induction ceremony on April 1, 2006 and in a backstage vignette with her immediate family at WrestleMania 22.|$|E
5|$|The visual {{then returns}} to the trailer park setting, where Azalea rides a lowrider bicycle through the area. She wears a {{perforated}} yellow visor, black <b>brassiere,</b> spiked yellow Louboutins and ethnic slim-fit pants. The video then enters a new scene where Azalea arrives at a dive bar and switches a jukebox on. At the bar, Azalea's two friends from the Freightliner Truck scene are seated at a table, and a long-haired man wearing dark sunglasses awaits her on {{a chair in the}} centre of building. Azalea, dressed in a palm tree bikini and yellow neon shorts, performs a lap dance for the man. She then steals his car keys and runs off with her friends, who drive the man's convertible out into the desert. Azalea is seen standing in the car, waving a thin piece of material in the wind. They drive through a day and night period before arriving in Hollywood in the morning. Azalea's friends then drop her off at a sidewalk, where the video ends with her walking in the city. She wears dark sunglasses, striped black-and-white shorts and a custom-made dalmatian-print blazer in the final scene.|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} requisites {{for evaluating}} the comfortable clothing pressure of <b>brassieres,</b> I measured changes in clothing pressure that felt comfortable at rest (normal standing posture) and subjective evaluation during movement. Clothing pressure data were measured at 0. 1 -second intervals, and the average of those was considered the synthetic value of the clothing pressure. The difference between the maximum and the minimum values of clothing pressure that varied according to respiration and movement was considered the change in clothing pressure. Changes in clothing pressure and subjective evaluation due to the removal of straps were also studied. Samples were four types of underwired <b>brassieres</b> of different designs including strapless <b>brassieres.</b> Points measured were the six points where thick fabric with wires or rubber tapes may tightly press the skin; the intersections of the lower hem and mammillary lines (points a and a 2 ̆ 7), those of the lower hem and side wires (points b and b 2 ̆ 7), {{and those of the}} upper hem and side wires (points c and c 2 ̆ 7). The results are reported as follows: 1) The <b>brassieres</b> that felt comfortable at rest were not necessarily comfortable during movement. It may be necessary to confirm subjective evaluation during movement to evaluate the comfortable clothing pressure. 2) The <b>brassieres</b> with small changes in clothing pressure tended to give a slightly tight impression. Thus, the changes in clothing pressure during movement should be studied when evaluating the comfortable clothing pressure. 3) The positions of straps tended to influence the distribution of clothing pressure at the lower hem of the <b>brassieres.</b> Therefore, it was difficult to determine a comfortable clothing pressure collectively for <b>brassieres</b> of different designs. The comfortable clothing pressure of <b>brassieres</b> should be determined in relation to their designs. 4) For strapless <b>brassieres,</b> movement caused a large shift and significantly ruined comfortableness. Rotation of the arms slightly increased pressure at points a and a 2 ̆ 7, and the change in clothing pressure at points b and b 2 ̆ 7 or c and c 2 ̆ 7 tended to be slightly small. The removal of straps may cause changes in the pressure applied to the body...|$|R

25|$|Convalescence — Post-operative care {{is minimal}} after a mastopexy procedure; the lifted breasts are {{supported}} with a porous, soft elastic tape, which is removed at 7–10 days post-operative, {{and then is}} reapplied to the mastopexy incisions for an additional 1–2 weeks during convalescence. For comfortable healing of the wounds, the woman wears a surgical <b>brassière,</b> and avoids wearing an underwire <b>brassière</b> until the breast implants have settled into position. The mastopexy outcome is photographed at 2–3 months post-operative.|$|E

25|$|The {{patient is}} {{discharged}} from hospital either {{the same day}} or {{the day after the}} breast reduction operation. Because the liposuction-only procedure featured only a few, small, surgical incisions, the woman quickly recovers her health, usually resuming daily life activities at 14 to 28 days post-operative — when the breast-molding dressings are changed; she also resumes her personal hygiene regimen to include washing under a water shower. In the initial convalescence period, the surgical-incision wounds are inspected at 1-week post-operative, during which time the woman has continuously worn a strapless <b>brassière</b> to contain and immobilize her corrected breasts; afterwards, she continuously wears a strapped <b>brassière</b> for 30 days after the breast-reduction operation.|$|E

25|$|The corset {{reached its}} longest length {{in the early}} 20th century. At first, the {{longline}} corset reached from the bust down to the upper thigh. There was also a style of longline corset that started under the bust, and necessitated the wearing of a <b>brassiere.</b> This style was meant to complement the new silhouette. It was a boneless style, much closer to a modern girdle than the traditional corset. The longline style was abandoned during World War I.|$|E
25|$|In {{the woman}} afflicted with gigantomastia (>1,000 gm {{increase}} per breast), the average breast-volume reduction diminished her oversized bust by three (3) <b>brassière</b> cup-sizes.

Afterwards, the woman's ability to comfortably perform physical activities previously impeded by oversized breasts improves her emotional health (self-esteem) by reducing anxiety and lessening psychological depression.|$|E
