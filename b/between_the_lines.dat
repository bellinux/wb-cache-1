5|$|As {{a casual}} {{actor in the}} early 1990s, Nesbitt mixed {{television}} and film roles; he appeared in episodes of Boon, The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, Covington Cross, Lovejoy, and <b>Between</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lines.</b> He also played roles in several Michael Winterbottom films, beginning with Loves Lies Bleeding in 1993 and continuing with Go Now in 1995, Jude in 1996 and Welcome to Sarajevo in 1997.|$|E
5|$|In an {{adjacent}} sector, a short truce {{to bury the}} dead <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> led to official repercussions; a company commander, Sir Iain Colquhoun of the Scots Guards, was court-martialled for defying standing orders to the contrary. While he was found guilty and reprimanded, the punishment was annulled by General Haig and Colquhoun remained in his position; the official leniency may perhaps have been because he was related to H. H. Asquith, the Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of nationalisation, {{interchanges}} were provided <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> previously belonging to the three different companies that built them (AATC, CHADOPyF and Lacroze) since previously only the CHADOPyF lines (C, D and E) had formal connections between them. However, the rate of expansion of the network during this period had slowed considerably and only one station was opened during the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the MR were {{rebuilding}} and resiting Quainton Road station, freeing {{space for}} a direct link between the former Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway and the O to be built. A curve <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> opened on 1 January 1897, allowing through running between the two lines.|$|E
5|$|Although {{built and}} {{initially}} operated as two separate stations {{by the two}} companies, the C and the CCE platforms were sufficiently close together that a deep level interchange was constructed between the passages of the two stations with a small ticket office for passengers changing <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines.</b> Another passage led to lifts that surfaced within the main line station itself. With the entrance within the main line station able to serve both sets of platforms satisfactorily, the separate station buildings were considered unnecessary, and they both closed on 30 September 1914. The CCE building remains (converted for use as an electrical substation), but the C's building was demolished in 1934 to enable the construction of Euston House for the London, Midland and Scottish Railway.|$|E
5|$|His role in The Widowmaker lead to {{him being}} offered and taking many obsessive {{character}} roles; he played {{police officers in}} Black and Blue, Framed, <b>Between</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lines</b> and Out of the Blue, and soldier Andy McNab in The One That Got Away (1996). Morrissey first met screenwriter Peter Bowker when he played Detective Sergeant Jim Llewyn in the second series of Bowker's Out of the Blue. In 1994, he played customs officer Gerry Birch in the first series of The Knock, and Stephen Finney in the six-part ITV series Finney. In Finney, Morrissey assumed the role originated by Sting in Stormy Monday (Mike Figgis, 1988). He was the first choice for the part and {{had to learn to}} play the double bass.|$|E

5|$|Located at the {{junction}} of two earlier tube railway schemes, the station was opened in 1906 by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP). The station entrances and below ground circulation were largely reconstructed for the introduction of escalators {{and the opening of}} Central line platforms in 1933, making the station the only interchange <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines.</b> Before 1994, Holborn was the northern terminus of the short and little-frequented Piccadilly line branch to Aldwych and two platforms originally used for this service are disused. One of the disused platforms has been used for location filming when a London Underground station platform is needed.|$|E
5|$|The next day, 20 May, {{the smell}} of rotting corpses in no man's land and the {{numerous}} wounded still located <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> convinced the New Zealand and Australian Division staff to suggest an armistice. Soon an informal truce began under the flags of the Red Cross and Red Crescent. Turkish stretcher-bearers headed into no man's land to collect the dead and wounded. Just after 19:00 {{it appeared that the}} Turks were massing troops for an attack while gathering their wounded, so the 9th Battalion opened fire on them. The Turks responded with their artillery bombarding the Australian trenches.|$|E
5|$|To {{construct}} the new Central line platforms, the larger diameter station tunnels were manually excavated around the existing running tunnels whilst trains continued to run. When the excavations were complete, the original segmental tunnel linings were dismantled. The new platforms came into use on 25 September 1933 replacing those of British Museum, which had closed the day before. As {{part of the}} modernisation the station was renamed Holborn (Kingsway) on 22 May 1933, but the suffix gradually dropped out of use and no longer appears on station signage or tube maps. The new platforms at Holborn led {{to the number of}} passengers switching <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> increasing tenfold by 1938.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{was known}} for his {{composure}} and ability to score several goals for his team as a forward, Bergkamp was also capable of playing behind a lone striker, where he essentially functioned in the number 10 role as a playmaking attacking midfielder or deep-lying forward, due to his ball skills and creative ability, which enabled him to drop deep <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> and link-up play. A quick, elegant, intelligent, and technically gifted player, his excellent first touch, quick feet, dribbling ability, and change of pace enabled him to beat defenders in one on one situations, while his attacking movement, physique, balance, and close control allowed him to hold up the ball and create space for teammates; his vision and passing range with both feet, despite being naturally right-footed, subsequently allowed him to provide assists for on-running strikers. Bergkamp often stated he preferred playing in this deeper role, as he derived more pleasure from assisting goals, rather than scoring them himself.|$|E
5|$|On February 13, {{several small}} probing attacks {{were carried out}} against the Confederate defenses, {{essentially}} ignoring orders from Grant that no general engagement be provoked. On the Union left, C. F. Smith sent two of his four brigades (under Cols. Jacob Lauman and John Cook) to test the defenses along his front. The attack suffered light casualties and made no gains, but Smith {{was able to keep}} up a harassing fire throughout the night. On the right, McClernand also ordered an unauthorized attack. Two regiments of Col. William R. Morrison's brigade, along with one regiment, the 48th Illinois, from Col. W.H.L. Wallace's brigade, were ordered to seize a battery ("Redan Number 2") that had been plaguing their position. Isham N. Haynie, colonel of the 48th Illinois, was senior in rank to Colonel Morrison. Although rightfully in command of two of the three regiments, Morrison volunteered to turn over command once the attack was under way; however, when the attack began, Morrison was wounded, eliminating any leadership ambiguity. For unknown reasons Haynie never fully took control and the attack was repulsed. Some wounded men caught <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> burned to death in grass fires ignited by the artillery.|$|E
5|$|On {{the south}} side of the outer defences, facing the river, are the West and East Lines of gun positions. These were built in the 18th century and have been subject to {{considerable}} erosion and silting; 12 of the original 14 gun positions on the West Line remain but only one of the East Line has survived. In <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> is a quay, designed to allow the delivery of supplies from the Thames, and the remains of the tracks from the narrow gauge railway built during the First World War. A sluice gate in the south-west corner managed the water in the moats, and allowed them to be drained completely should the surfaces begin to freeze over in winter and provide an advantage to any attackers. To the west of the outer defences is the World's End pub, originally the local ferry house, dating from 1788.|$|E

5|$|The Buenos Aires Underground has had {{among the}} longest serving and most varied rolling {{stock in the}} world, {{in part due to}} the network having been {{originally}} built and operated by three different companies in its early years, causing incompatibilities <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines.</b> The network began with uniform rolling stock, with the Anglo-Argentine Tramways Company Anglo-Argentine Line A using La Brugeoise cars (with {{the exception of a few}} UEC Preston cars), the three CHADOPyF lines (C, D and E) using Siemens-Schuckert Orenstein & Koppel stock and Lacroze's Line B using Metro Cammell cars. However, as the lines were expanded and passenger numbers increased, more rolling stock was needed, which made the network less uniform, particularly with regards to the problematic Line B, which used a different electrification system and measurements to the other lines. Line B also became the first line of the network to receive second-hand rolling stock in 1995.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} {{electric}} fields created by stationary charges is called electrostatics. The field may be visualised {{by a set}} of imaginary lines whose direction at any point is {{the same as that of}} the field. This concept was introduced by Faraday, whose term 'lines of force' still sometimes sees use. The field lines are the paths that a point positive charge would seek to make as it was forced to move within the field; they are however an imaginary concept with no physical existence, and the field permeates all the intervening space <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines.</b> Field lines emanating from stationary charges have several key properties: first, that they originate at positive charges and terminate at negative charges; second, that they must enter any good conductor at right angles, and third, that they may never cross nor close in on themselves.|$|E
5|$|With through running <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> in place, in June 1899 the MR {{inspected}} the O's carriages and locomotives, and had serious concerns. The original passenger carriage {{began as a}} horse tram and was shabby internally, and unsafe {{as part of a}} longer train. The passenger carriage from the 1870s was in a poor condition. The 1895 Bristol passenger carriages were unfit owing to their light construction. Eight of the O's nine goods wagons did not comply with Railway Clearing House standards and could not be used on other lines. On 4 October 1899 the MR loaned the O an eight-wheeled 70seat passenger carriage. As this had been built for the MR's standard height platforms rather than the O's low platforms, 80–100ft (24–30m) of each platform on the Tramway was raised to standard height to accommodate the MR carriage.|$|E

5|$|During the 1840s and 1850s, {{a flurry}} of railroad-building {{activity}} led to the completion of four separate railroads converging in Erie. A break of gauge between the the Erie and North East Railroad and the Franklin Canal Companyensured that the citizens of Erie profited from the delays necessary to transfer cargo <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines.</b> When it was proposed in 1853 to standardize the track gauge to allow through traffic, a conflict that {{became known as the}} Erie Gauge War ensued. The residents of Erie, who saw it as an affront to their desire that the city become a major lake port, dismantled railroad bridges and tore up railroad tracks in the city in an effort to prevent the impending standardization. As part of the dispute's settlement, both railroads provided financial support for the construction of the Erie and Pittsburgh and Sunbury and Erie railroads. The Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad acquired the Franklin Canal Company in 1854, and the Erie and North East was merged with the Buffalo and State Line to form the Buffalo and Erie Railroad a few years later. The Sunbury and Erie was renamed the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad in 1861. The Pennsylvania Railroad soon acquired the Sunbury and Erie through a 999-year lease and funded completion of the line by 1864.|$|E
25|$|The {{career of}} writer-producer Fred Barron began in 1975 {{when he used}} the history of Cambridge’s The Real Paper {{as the basis for}} a screenplay, <b>Between</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lines.</b> When Joan Micklin Silver brought Hester Street (1975) to the Welles Cinema, she was joined at the Welles Restaurant by Barron and others. When someone asked what she would direct next, she {{answered}} that she was looking at screenplays. Barron stood up, left the restaurant and returned with his screenplay. The success of <b>Between</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lines</b> (1977) led to a short-lived television series, also titled <b>Between</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lines.</b>|$|E
