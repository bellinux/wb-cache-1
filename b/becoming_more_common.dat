5|$|From a Neo-Darwinian perspective, {{evolution}} {{occurs when}} there are changes in the frequencies of alleles within a population of interbreeding organisms. For example, the allele for black colour in a population of moths <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> <b>common.</b> Mechanisms {{that can lead to}} changes in allele frequencies include natural selection, genetic drift, genetic hitchhiking, mutation and gene flow.|$|E
5|$|However, {{adaptation}} {{to climate change}} has been demonstrated in many cases. These are usually due to a shift in coral and zooxanthellae genotypes. These shifts in allele frequency have progressed toward more tolerant types of zooxanthellae. Scientists found that a certain scleractinian zooxanthella is <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> where sea temperature is high. Symbionts able to tolerate warmer water seem to photosynthesise more slowly, implying an evolutionary trade-off.|$|E
5|$|In {{traditional}} times, Māori had a rich {{knowledge of}} the cabbage tree, including spiritual, ecological and many practical aspects of its use. While much of that specialised knowledge was lost after the European settlement of New Zealand, {{the use of the}} tree as food and medicine has persisted, and the use of its fibres for weaving is <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> <b>common.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{subject of}} duelling was highly topical {{in the period}} the play originated; duels were <b>becoming</b> much <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in England, and King James's first {{proclamation}} against duelling was issued in October 1613.|$|R
5|$|Following the {{colonisation}} of Australia by the British, the 19th century saw {{the initial}} European exploration and {{settlement of the}} area and their encounters with the local indigenous peoples, beginning with the first explorations in 1820 and shortly followed by the first European settlements in 1824. At the outset the region was dominated by large properties used for sheep and cattle grazing, which had been granted to free settlers that had arrived in Australia from the United Kingdom and other European countries. These large properties were later broken up and subdivided in accordance with changes to land tenure arrangements, smaller farms and urban developments <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> <b>common.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gout affects around 1–2% of the Western {{population}} {{at some point}} in their lifetimes and is <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> <b>common.</b> Some 5.8 million people were affected in 2013. Rates of gout approximately doubled between 1990 and 2010. This rise is believed to be due to increasing life expectancy, changes in diet and an increase in diseases associated with gout, such as metabolic syndrome and high blood pressure. Factors that influence rates of gout, include age, race and the season of the year. In men over 30 and women over 50, rates are 2%.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, high scores in cricket matches were <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> as pitches improved, and in the summer of 1880, Roe gave a prelude to his record {{breaking}} of the following year when he hit 223 in a one-day match against his former school. In competitive, albeit second-class, county cricket, his scores remained significantly lower. Nor did he impress in the trial matches at Cambridge in his second year, resulting in him not appearing for the university that season.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the Hemophilus influenzae (Hib) vaccination in many Western countries, childhood incidence has decreased while adult incidence has remained the same; the disease is thus <b>becoming</b> relatively <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in adults than children.|$|R
50|$|It is <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> and <b>more</b> <b>common</b> {{for medical}} {{education}} {{around the world}} to be supported by online teaching, usually within learning management systems (LMSs) or virtual learning environments (VLEs).|$|R
25|$|Most commonly, {{drugs are}} organic small {{molecules}} produced through chemical synthesis, but biopolymer-based drugs (also known as biopharmaceuticals) produced through biological processes are <b>becoming</b> increasingly <b>more</b> <b>common.</b> In addition, mRNA-based gene silencing technologies may have therapeutic applications.|$|R
5|$|The first skyscrapers {{were mainly}} {{occupied}} by male workers, but this changed during the 1890s, with female employees <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> <b>common.</b> The percentage of female clerical workers in Chicago, for example, increased from 11 percent in 1880 to 21 percent by 1890, reaching 30 percent by 1900. Various moral concerns were raised about {{men and women}} mixing in such offices, which were characterized as being masculine spaces, full of tobacco smoke and profanity and therefore unsuitable for women. The new female workers typically worked as typists or stenographers, using the recently invented typewriter, which grew in number in U.S. offices from 146 in 1879 to 65,000 by 1890.|$|E
5|$|The {{rectangular}} west {{tower was}} a relatively short defensive structure, {{designed to protect the}} more vulnerable western slope of the ridge. A similar tower in the south overlooks the entrance to the castle. At {{the north end of the}} castle is the hall, stretching across the courtyard; in the east corner is an additional building, probably built by the English at the end of the 13th century. Although the hall is relatively large, 50 by 27feet (15 by 8m), these buildings follow a simpler design to those current in England at the time, where a combination of a hall, chamber and a service block in castles was <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> <b>common.</b>|$|E
5|$|With {{knowledge}} of his sexuality <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> beginning in the 1970s, some film historians and gay studies scholars have detected homosexual themes in Whale's work, particularly in Bride of Frankenstein in which {{a number of the}} creative people associated with the cast, including Ernest Thesiger and Colin Clive, were alleged to be gay or bisexual. Scholars have identified a gay sensibility suffused through the film, especially a camp sensibility, particularly embodied in the character of Pretorius (Thesiger) and his relationship with Henry Frankenstein (Clive).|$|E
50|$|Orchids are <b>becoming</b> {{increasingly}} <b>more</b> <b>common</b> as restoration {{work has}} been going on putting orchids back in their natural habitat. Purple pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea), while once common, has been poached from the area and no longer occurs.|$|R
5|$|In {{southern}} Chad, bitter {{conflicts over}} land are <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> and <b>more</b> <b>common.</b> They frequently turn violent. Long-standing community culture is being eroded – {{and so are}} the livelihoods of many farmers.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the last}} decade {{with the aid of}} science and technology, we are more {{familiar}} with the human brain and its function than ever before. Development in neuroimaging techniques has greatly enhanced the scope and outcome of neurorehabilitation. Now, scientists are using technology with neurorehabilitation to provide cutting edge improvements to therapies for patients with nervous system issues. In particular, the use of robotics in neurorehabilitation is <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> and <b>more</b> <b>common.</b>|$|R
5|$|Although both colour morphs {{occur in}} much of the European range, brown birds predominate in the more humid climate of western Europe, with the grey phase <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> further east; in the northernmost regions, all the owls are a cold-grey colour. Siberian and Central Asian {{subspecies}} have grey and white plumage, the North African race is dark grey-brown, and South and East Asian birds have barred, not striped, underparts, and fine lines around the facial disc. The Siberian and Scandinavian subspecies are 12% larger and 40% heavier, and have 13% longer wings than western European birds, in accordance with Bergmann's rule which predicts that northern forms will typically be bigger than their southern counterparts.|$|E
5|$|The Australian raven {{is common}} {{throughout}} eastern Australia, and southern Western Australia (the populations being {{connected by a}} narrow strip across the Nullarbor Plain), but it is rarer and more scattered in the north, with isolated sightings in Cape York at Coen, Windmill Creek and the Mitchell River, and <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> south of Rockhampton in central Queensland. It is found throughout New South Wales, though is uncommon in the northeast of the state. It is rare in the Australian Alps, being replaced there by the little raven. It occurs across Victoria and eastern South Australia, through the Eyre Peninsula and Nullarbor Plain into Western Australia, across the state north to the Wooramel River. It is found on some offshore islands such as Rottnest Island and Kangaroo Island. It is a rare vagrant to Lord Howe Island.|$|E
5|$|The Secret Speech, {{combined}} {{with the death of}} Polish communist leader Boleslaw Bierut, who suffered a heart attack while reading the Speech, sparked considerable liberalization in Poland and Hungary. In Poland, a worker's strike in Poznań developed into disturbances which left more than 50 dead in October 1956. When Moscow blamed the disturbances on Western agitators, Polish leaders ignored the claim, and instead made concessions to the workers. With anti-Soviet displays <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in Poland, and crucial Polish leadership elections upcoming, Khrushchev and other Presidium members flew to Warsaw. While the Soviets were refused entry to the Polish Central Committee plenum where the election was taking place, they met with the Polish Presidium. The Soviets agreed to allow the new Polish leadership to take office, on the assurance there would be no change to the Soviet-Polish relationship.|$|E

50|$|Engine sizes vary {{according}} to each forces vehicle procurement policies but range from 1.3 to 2.0. Although petrol-powered engines once dominated, diesel engines are now <b>becoming</b> much <b>more</b> <b>common</b> due to their superior fuel economy and therefore lower operating costs.|$|R
50|$|The ECTS grading {{scale is}} <b>more</b> and <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in the {{post-secondary}} education system, {{since it is}} the standard for comparing study performance throughout the European Union. The GPA grading scale is <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> and <b>more</b> <b>common</b> as well, since it eases the comparison with American students.|$|R
5|$|Farmer {{formed the}} Jazztet in 1959, with the {{composer}} and tenor saxophonist Benny Golson, after each man independently {{came to the}} conclusion that the other should be a member of his new sextet. The Jazztet lasted until 1962, recorded several albums for Argo and Mercury Records, and assisted in the early careers of pianist McCoy Tyner and trombonist Grachan Moncur III. In the early 1960s Farmer established a trio with guitarist Jim Hall and bassist Steve Swallow; his relationship with Hall lasted from 1962 to 1964, and included two tours of Europe, one of which had concerts recorded for the BBC's Jazz 625 programme, which were later released on DVD. Hall left the second tour while the quartet, which included Swallow and drummer Pete La Roca, was engaged in Berlin, and a pianist replaced him; this was ultimately Steve Kuhn. In 1964, this new quartet recorded the album Sing Me Softly of the Blues for the Atlantic label. These bands played laid back, melodious music during a period when avant-garde jazz was <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> <b>common.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dinosaur {{evolution}} {{after the}} Triassic follows changes in vegetation {{and the location}} of continents. In the late Triassic and early Jurassic, the continents were connected as the single landmass Pangaea, and there was a worldwide dinosaur fauna mostly composed of coelophysoid carnivores and early sauropodomorph herbivores. Gymnosperm plants (particularly conifers), a potential food source, radiated in the late Triassic. Early sauropodomorphs did not have sophisticated mechanisms for processing food in the mouth, and so must have employed other means of breaking down food farther along the digestive tract. The general homogeneity of dinosaurian faunas continued into the middle and late Jurassic, where most localities had predators consisting of ceratosaurians, spinosauroids, and carnosaurians, and herbivores consisting of stegosaurian ornithischians and large sauropods. Examples of this include the Morrison Formation of North America and Tendaguru Beds of Tanzania. Dinosaurs in China show some differences, with specialized sinraptorid theropods and unusual, long-necked sauropods like Mamenchisaurus. Ankylosaurians and ornithopods were also <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> <b>common,</b> but prosauropods had become extinct. Conifers and pteridophytes were the most common plants. Sauropods, like the earlier prosauropods, were not oral processors, but ornithischians were evolving various means of dealing with food in the mouth, including potential cheek-like organs to keep food in the mouth, and jaw motions to grind food. Another notable evolutionary event of the Jurassic was the appearance of true birds, descended from maniraptoran coelurosaurians.|$|E

30|$|Without {{expecting to}} be exhaustive, studies and {{researches}} developed worldwide have been examined, {{with reference to the}} countries (as European countries and Australia) where the roundabouts have an older tradition and schemes of turbo-roundabouts are already in operation. Reference is also made to non-European countries where in more recent times roundabouts are <b>becoming</b> <b>more</b> and <b>more</b> <b>common</b> as intersection control and great emphasis has been given to geometric design and the appropriate use of the many roundabout installations progressively realized.|$|R
