60|$|Fritz Muller {{formerly}} {{believed that}} a species <b>of</b> Oxalis, which <b>is</b> so abundant in St. Catharina that it borders the roads for miles, <b>was</b> dimorphic instead <b>of</b> trimorphic. Although the pistils and stamens vary greatly in length, as was evident in some specimens sent to me, yet the plants {{can be divided into}} two sets, according to the lengths of these organs. A large proportion <b>of</b> the anthers <b>are</b> <b>of</b> a <b>white</b> <b>colour</b> and quite destitute of pollen; others which are pale yellow contain many bad with some good grains; and others again which are bright yellow have apparently sound pollen; but he has never succeeded in finding any fruit on this species. The stamens in some <b>of</b> the flowers <b>are</b> partially converted into petals. Fritz Muller after reading my description, hereafter to <b>be</b> given, <b>of</b> the illegitimate offspring of various heterostyled species, suspects that these plants <b>of</b> Oxalis may <b>be</b> the variable and sterile offspring of a single form of some trimorphic species, perhaps accidentally introduced into the district, which has since been propagated asexually. It is probable that this kind <b>of</b> propagation would <b>be</b> much aided by there being no expenditure in the production of seed.|$|R
60|$|There {{are other}} {{and much more}} {{remarkable}} differences between the sexes of certain lizards. The male of Ceratophora aspera bears on the extremity of his snout an appendage half {{as long as the}} head. It is cylindrical, covered with scales, flexible, and apparently capable of erection: in the female it is quite rudimental. In a second species of the same genus a terminal scale forms a minute horn on the summit of the flexible appendage; and in a third species (C. Stoddartii, fig. 34) the whole appendage is converted into a horn, which <b>is</b> usually <b>of</b> a <b>white</b> <b>colour,</b> but assumes a purplish tint when the animal is excited. In the adult male of this latter species the horn is half an inch in length, but <b>is</b> <b>of</b> quite minute size in the female and in the young. These appendages, as Dr. Günther has remarked to me, may be compared with the combs of gallinaceous birds, and apparently serve as ornaments.|$|R
40|$|After {{exploring}} {{a large number}} of sparingly soluble systems, the author obtained good rings with the following materials in the agar agar gel a) Lead silicate, b) silver molybdate, c) thorium oxinate, d) cadmium oxinate, e) cupric chromate and f) thorium carbonate. Out of these systems, Liesegang rings <b>of</b> cupric chromate <b>are</b> found to be reported in the past literature. Since no quantitative studies were made on this system and this system was found to <b>be</b> one <b>of</b> the best, from the view point of possessing detailed macro and micro structures, it has been purposely included in this thesis to reflect more light on the mechanism of formation of Liesegang rings. Out of six systems, four systems <b>were</b> <b>of</b> <b>white</b> <b>colour</b> and two systems <b>were</b> <b>of</b> greenish yellow and scarlet red cum dark yellow <b>colour</b> respectively. <b>White</b> rings system <b>of</b> lead silicate and thorium carbonate were very similar to one another in appearance and in their large number, produced in the test tubes. These rings <b>were</b> <b>of</b> thin discs nature separated by medium spacing, just somewhat micro spicing reported in some systems. Contrary to these two systems, thorium and cadmium oxinate produced a few number somewhat thicker rings separated by large void spaces. Cupric chromate system produced one category of system with M/ 20 concentration of internal electrolyte, but largely different in the remaining lower concentrations of internal electrolyte. Rings obtained with M/ 20 internal electrolyte had all the combinations of the three types of structures, viz. Revert type alternate coloured band followed by clear spaces and in between these precipitate rings occurred the micro structure fringes. In these studies the distances between the consecutive rings were measured {{with the help of a}} cathetometer. The data obtained are processed as per equation 			Log (Xn – Xn- 1) = A + α Xn And plotted in various figures. These figures were used for the verification of the validity of logarithmic equation and thus the indirectly the validity of Mathur’s Damped Harmonic Wave Diffusion Theory. Different curves drawn for different concentrations of external and internal electrolytes for each system depicted the influence of the concentrations on the rings spacing obeying the following relationship. 			(Xn – Xn- 1) = [P(S/CoC’o) ] eαxn In some of the systems like lead silicate and thorium carbonate the number <b>of</b> rings <b>was</b> fairly large and uniformly distributed. Hence, in these two cases the ring points were falling more precisely on straight line curves than in some other systems in which the number <b>of</b> rings produced <b>were</b> less and the disturbance effect of temperature etc., sometime is more pronounced as in the case of silver molybdate. In some systems which produced broad rings separated by large void spaces such as the one thorium oxinate, it could be observed that even the thickness of the precipitate rings changes from ring to ring and also from test tube to test tube for the nth ring with respect to the concentration of the electrolyte. Data on thickness <b>of</b> the rings <b>are</b> also recorded in this particular case. The author investigated qualitatively and quantitatively in detail six different systems of periodic precipitations and verified the validity of Wave Harmonic Diffusion Theory of Mathur for Liesegang Rings are found that the data obtained on these few systems studied for under the present research work fits in the theory and the equations derived by Mathur...|$|R
6000|$|The Pleuronectidae, or Flat-fish, are {{remarkable}} for their asymmetrical bodies. They rest on one side--in the {{greater number of}} species on the left, but in some on the right side; and occasionally reversed adult specimens occur. The lower, or resting-surface, resembles at first sight the ventral surface of an ordinary fish; it <b>is</b> <b>of</b> a <b>white</b> <b>colour,</b> less developed in many ways than the upper side, with the lateral fins often of smaller size. But the eyes offer the most remarkable peculiarity; for they are both placed on the upper side of the head. During early youth, however, they stand opposite to each other, and the whole body is then symmetrical, with both sides equally coloured. Soon the eye proper to the lower side begins to glide slowly round the head to the upper side; but does not pass right through the skull, as was formerly {{thought to be the}} case. It is obvious that unless the lower eye did thus travel round, it could not be used by the fish while lying in its habitual position on one side. The lower eye would, also, have been liable to be abraded by the sandy bottom. That the Pleuronectidae are admirably adapted by their flattened and asymmetrical structure for their habits <b>of</b> life, <b>is</b> manifest from several species, such as soles, flounders, etc., being extremely common. The chief advantages thus gained seem to be protection from their enemies, and facility for feeding on the ground. The different members, however, of the family present, as Schiodte remarks, [...] "a long series of forms exhibiting a gradual transition from Hippoglossus pinguis, which does not in any considerable degree alter the shape in which it leaves the ovum, to the soles, which are entirely thrown to one side." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{number of}} living creatures of all Orders, whose {{existence}} intimately {{depends on the}} kelp, is wonderful. A great volume might be written, describing the inhabitants {{of one of these}} beds of seaweed. Almost all the leaves, excepting those that float on the surface, are so thickly incrusted with corallines as to <b>be</b> <b>of</b> a <b>white</b> <b>colour.</b> We find exquisitely delicate structures, some inhabited by simple hydra-like polypi, others by more organised kinds, and beautiful compound Ascidiae. On the leaves, also, various patelliform shells, Trochi, uncovered molluscs, and some bivalves are attached. Innumerable crustacea frequent every part of the plant. On shaking the great entangled roots, a pile of small fish, shells, cuttlefish, crabs of all orders, sea-eggs, starfish, beautiful Holothuriae, Planariae, and crawling nereidous animals of a multitude of forms, all fall out together. Often as I recurred to a branch of the kelp, I never failed to discover animals of new and curious structures. In Chiloe, where the kelp does not thrive very well, the numerous shells, corallines, and crustacea are absent; but there yet remain a few of the Flustraceae, and some compound Ascidiae; the latter, however, <b>are</b> <b>of</b> different species from those in Tierra del Fuego; we see here the fucus possessing a wider range than the animals which use it as an abode. I can only compare these great aquatic forests of the southern hemisphere with the terrestrial ones in the intertropical regions. Yet if in any country a forest was destroyed, I do not believe nearly so many species of animals would perish as would here, from the destruction of the kelp. Amidst the leaves of this plant numerous species of fish live, which nowhere else could find food or shelter; with their destruction the many cormorants and other fishing birds, the otters, seals, and porpoises, would soon perish also; and lastly, the Fuegian savage, the miserable lord of this miserable land, would redouble his cannibal feast, decrease in numbers, and perhaps cease to exist.|$|R

40|$|A conference {{paper on}} the {{chemistry}} of African aloes. The genus Aloe consists of more than 360 species distributed mainly in Tropical Africa, Madagascar and Southern Arabia (Mabberley 1987) and includes herbs, shrubs and trees. The leaves are fleshy, strongly cuticularized and are usually prickly at the margins. The flowers <b>are</b> <b>of</b> various <b>colours,</b> <b>white,</b> yellow, pink, greenish and red. The bitter leaf exudates of some Aloe species are commercially important sources of the laxative aloe drug and are also used in the cosmetics industry as additives in shampoos, shaving and skin care creams (Leung 1970) and {{in the treatment of}} skin disorder and in particular as topical medication for the treatment of burns (Rowe et at. 1941). The exudate has also been used as bittering agent in alcoholic beverages. The term aloe is derived from the Arabic word aHoeh which means a shining bitter substance (Tyler et al. 1976). Medicinally, the gel and dried leaf exudates of Aloe species have been used since ancient civilizations of the Egyptians, and Mediterranean peoples (Trease and Evans 1976). Egyptian copts used aloe to treat eye diseases, swellings and digestive disorders. Aloe was known to the Greeks for Alexander the Great {{is said to have been}} advised to conquer the island of Socotra near the East African shores to get aloe drug to treat his wounded soldiers (Maniche 1989).
