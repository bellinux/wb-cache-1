500|$|Following post war tests by the British Navy on German Type XXIII {{submarines}}, it {{was decided}} by the Admiralty to modify eight T-class submarines to enlarge the batteries, increase {{the power of the}} motors and streamline the hulls. In 1950, Tarbards pressure hull was cut at the after end of the engine room and the submarine was lengthened by [...] This gave enough room to add an additional battery compartment and a second pair of electric motors. The propulsion system was changed from direct to dieselelectric transmission. Along with , Tabard was one of two boats which were further modified by incorporating their bridge into a streamlined fin. Other streamlining adjustments were made to the hull with all external fittings removed, including the external torpedo tubes and gun. The periscopes, radar masts, snort mast and wireless mast were all incorporated into the new <b>bridge</b> <b>fin.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{submarine}} {{was presented}} with a totem pole by the Cowichan Tribes in 1945, which was stolen during the 1950s when the boat was visiting Halifax, Canada. The pole was fitted {{to the front of}} the <b>bridge</b> <b>fin</b> when the submarine was in harbour.|$|E
5000|$|Events include: dragon boat racing, lion dancing, Chinese wrestling, trampoline, dance sports, bridge, golf, aerobics, water skiing, parachuting, body {{building}} and fitness, billiards, chess, Chinese chess, mountaineering and climbing, squash, orienteering, hobby craft, wireless location hunt, bowling, roller sports, open water swimming, tug of war; fin swimming, goal ball, boules, <b>bridge,</b> <b>fin</b> swimming, billiards and [...] "Go (game)".|$|E
5000|$|On 5 October, Chicoutimi {{was running}} on the surface, through heavy seas 100 mi north-west of County Mayo, Ireland. Both hatches in the <b>bridge</b> <b>fin</b> {{lock-out}} chamber were left open and an estimated [...] of seawater entered the vessel. The seawater caused an electrical panel to short out, which in turn started a major fire and caused all power to cut out, leaving the submarine adrift. Nine crewmembers were affected by smoke inhalation and the submarine was left drifting without power in heavy seas.|$|E
5000|$|As Bridge Creek flowed {{toward the}} growing Colorado River {{during the last}} ice age, it carved first through softer rocks and veered away from the harder Triassic and Jurassic sandstones, {{eventually}} creating a wide hairpin bend that flowed around a solid [...] "fin" [...] of sandstone that would become Rainbow Bridge. The previous course of the creek is still visible above the bridge. Water flows back on itself at bends and wide spots, creating swirling eddies along the banks. As the creek flowed around Rainbow <b>Bridge</b> <b>fin,</b> these abrasive eddies formed on both the upstream and downstream sides and cut circular alcoves in the rock wall. The sediment in the creek eventually scoured the softer layers of sandstone away, leaving the harder layers behind.|$|E
50|$|The work on Totem {{was done}} between 1951 and May 1953 at Chatham Dockyard (which carried out all eight super T-conversions), and {{involved}} inserting an additional hull section 14 ft long to accommodate extra switchgear {{and an extra}} pair of electric motors and replacing the batteries. The hull was streamlined, which included {{the removal of the}} deck gun and the replacement of the <b>bridge</b> <b>fin</b> with one which was taller, enclosing the periscopes and masts. The radar and sonar were updated at the same time. After the submarine had returned to service, her top speed exceeded 18 kn, aided by the unofficial removal in the dockyard at Malta of the housing for the airguard radar aerial which added 3/4 knot to her top speed.|$|E
5000|$|The boats of the Astute {{class are}} {{powered by a}} Rolls-Royce PWR2 (Core H) (a {{pressurised}} water reactor) and fitted with a pump-jet propulsor. The PWR2 reactor was developed for the Vanguard-class ballistic missile submarines and has a 25-year lifespan {{without the need for}} refuelling. [...] As a result, the new submarines are about 30 per cent larger than previous British fleet submarines, which were powered by smaller-diameter reactors. Like all Royal Navy submarines, the <b>bridge</b> <b>fin</b> of the Astute-class boats is specially reinforced to allow surfacing through ice caps. These submarines can also be fitted with a dry deck shelter, which allows special forces (e.g. SBS) to deploy whilst the submarine is submerged. More than 39,000 acoustic tiles mask the vessel's sonar signature, giving the Astute class improved acoustic qualities over any other submarine previously operated by the Royal Navy.|$|E
50|$|Following post war tests by the British Navy on German Type XXIII {{submarines}}, it {{was decided}} by the Admiralty to modify eight T-class submarines to enlarge the batteries, increase {{the power of the}} motors and streamline the hulls. In 1950, Tarbards pressure hull was cut at the after end of the engine room and the submarine was lengthened by 20 ft. This gave enough room to add an additional battery compartment and a second pair of electric motors. The propulsion system was changed from direct to diesel - electric transmission.

40|$|A field {{investigation}} is conducted to strengthening of Karkhe Bridge with type of steel slab-ongirder in Khouzestan, Iran {{that it was}} damaged due to unusual loading and had been extra vibration. In the first, two types of truck are assigned {{that one of them}} has loading of Iranian code (40 -ton-truck), and other has unusual loading (90 -ton-truck) that used in field for transportation of materials. In the next step, this bridge is analyzed by finite element method under these two types of loading, and load distribution factors for different modes are determined. According to these factors, flexural and torsional moment and also displacements of bridge are calculated. In order to strengthening of <b>bridge,</b> <b>fin</b> sections are used to increasing the flexural stiffness for girders, and lateral bracings are used to increasing the torsional stiffness. Finally, results of analysis after strengthening of structure are compared with results before strengthening, that it shows improving in distribution of load between girders and decrease of displacements for bridge deck...|$|E
