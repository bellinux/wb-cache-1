500|$|Tyler {{pulled out}} of a planned South American tour {{at the end of}} 2009 and seemed intent on {{pursuing}} solo projects, including his autobiography Does the Noise in My Head <b>Bother</b> <b>You?.</b> Tyler told Classic Rock magazine, [...] "I don't know what I'm doing yet, but it's definitely going to be something Steven Tyler: working on the brand of myself â€“ Brand Tyler."

500|$|After the {{completion}} of composing [...] "Fifteen", Swift became very nervous to show Anderson the song, for {{she did not know}} how her friend would respond. [...] "It was a really personal song, especially from her angle of it." [...] However, when Swift performed the song for Anderson and asked whether she was comfortable with the song, Anderson confirmed: [...] "She said, 'Does it <b>bother</b> <b>you</b> that your name is in a song that's so personal?' And it really doesn't just because of the way Taylor and I feel about it. If one girl can kind of learn from it or connect to a song like that, it's totally worth it." [...] With Anderson's consent, Swift recorded [...] "Fifteen" [...] with producer Nathan Chapman, who produced all but one track on Swift's 2006 eponymous debut album, Taylor Swift. Recording the highly personal track caused Swift to cry. Swift attributed the event to {{the fact that she is}} most likely to cry over when her loved ones undergo pain, as she witnesses it, rather than her own experiences. She went to say [...] "Fifteen" [...] usually gets her every time.|$|E

2500|$|Krypto has a {{surprisingly}} violent reaction to Kara Zor-El {{when he first}} encounters her. The dog happens upon the girl while she was exploring the Fortress of Solitude and attacks, {{going so far as}} to use his heat vision and other potentially lethal attacks.

2500|$|Christie {{was tried}} {{only for the}} murder of his wife Ethel. His trial began on 22June 1953, in the same court in which Evans had been tried three years earlier.
