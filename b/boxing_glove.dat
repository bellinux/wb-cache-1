5|$|Monkey Fight: One to {{four players}} {{simultaneously}} engage in combat by rolling {{in any direction}} with the analog stick and using the A button to punch opponents with a <b>boxing</b> <b>glove</b> attached to their monkey's ball. Points are awarded for knocking opponents {{off one of the}} three available arenas, with more points being awarded when the player currently in the lead is knocked off. The player with the most points is declared the winner of a round when the in-game timer reaches zero.

5|$|Q*bert Rebooted {{contains}} a port {{of the classic}} arcade game alongside a new playing mode that uses hexagonal shapes, {{increasing the number of}} possible movement directions to six. Additionally, the 'Rebooted' mode features new enemy types, including a <b>boxing</b> <b>glove</b> that punches Q*bert off the levels and a treasure chest that tries to avoid him. The game has 5 different stage designs spread across 40 levels, which contain three rounds and a bonus round and have to be completed with 5 lives. Gems are collected to unlock different skins for the Q*bert character, and completing levels multiple times while reaching specific time and score goals is awarded with stars that enable access to more levels.|$|E

Stephen Hawking has shown up to see what the Mensa group is up to and makes it clear he is unimpressed; however, he saves Lisa from being seriously injured by the angry townspeople. In the end, Hawking and Homer meet at Moe's Tavern for a drink. Homer imitates Hawking in an attempt to make him pay the tab and gets punched by a <b>boxing</b> <b>glove</b> on a spring, which is concealed in Hawking's wheelchair.|$|E
25|$|<b>Boxing</b> <b>gloves</b> are {{cushioned}} gloves that fighters wear {{on their}} hands during boxing matches and practices.

Valiant then performs a comedic vaudeville act, causing the weasels to die of laughter; Valiant kicks their leader, Smart Ass, into the machine's Dip vat, killing him instantly. Valiant then fights Doom, who is eventually flattened by a steamroller, but survives. Eddie is shocked when Doom reveals that he is the toon who killed Teddy. Valiant uses a toon mallet with a spring-loaded <b>boxing</b> <b>glove</b> and fires it at a switch that causes the machine to empty its dip onto Doom, dissolving him.|$|E

Beginning the procedure, Lois objects to Dr. Hartman's method of embryonic insertion. In response, he replies, [...] "Well, {{perhaps you could}} tell them—if only you spoke Hovitos," [...] a reference to Raiders of the Lost Ark. Later, {{in an attempt to}} cause Lois to have a miscarriage, Peter lays down a series of Grey's Anatomy DVDs in order to lure Lois into being punched in the stomach by the [...] "Acme Miscarriage Kit", a <b>boxing</b> <b>glove</b> attached to a crossbow. In a reference to the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoon series Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner, Peter ultimately ends up missing with the crossbow, causing the glove to bounce and hit a large rock and land inches in front of him as he is standing on a narrow cliff. The ground then drops out from underneath his feet, causing him to fall like Wile E. Coyote.|$|E

2500|$|Originally the attire for UFC {{was very}} open. Many fighters still chose to wear tight-fitting shorts or boxing-type trunks, while others wore long pants or singlets. Several wore wrestling shoes.

[...] UFC president Dana White was so furious about the fighter's choice of attire that he awarded an honorary [...] "getting those horrifying shorts off TV as soon as possible" [...] bonus to Ebersole for finishing the fight in the first round, and in following post-fight interviews made it clear that speedo style shorts will no longer be tolerated.|$|E

Badd made his first appearance at the company's premier pay-per-view Starrcade later that month, where he was randomly placed with Arachnaman in a Lethal Lottery tag team match against Scott Steiner and Firebreaker Chip. Badd's team lost. Shortly after, he began using [...] "Badd Blaster", a confetti gun that he would fire before his matches. Badd continued to rack up wins against the likes of Richard Morton and Tracy Smothers {{in the first half}} of 1992. He feuded with Page and his teammate Scotty Flamingo and the two competed in a series of televised and non-televised matches throughout 1992, including a boxing match on the November 18 episode of Clash of the Champions, which Flamingo won in the third round after Page filled Flamingo's <b>boxing</b> <b>glove</b> with water.|$|E

2500|$|Particularly massive {{sperm whale}} {{specimens}} have also proven willing (on rare occasions) to attack comparably sized whaleships. In {{the most famous}} example, on November 20, 1820 a huge bull sperm whale (purportedly 85-ft in length) rammed the 87-ft Nantucket whaler Essex twice, staving in the hull under the waterline and forcing the crew to abandon ship. After months adrift in lifeboats, the crew eventually resorted to cannibalism, with only 8 out of the 20 sailors surviving until rescue; a 21st sailor had jumped ship in South America before the attack. The bull was unwounded and unprovoked {{at the time of}} the attack, but the crew of the Essex was in the process of hunting several smaller females from a nearby pod. Recent analysis suggests that the commotion and the bull's possible extreme size may have caused it to falsely identify the similarly-sized Essex as an intruding competitive male. Bull sperm whales, especially older, solitary bulls, are known to battle amongst themselves for dominance by ramming each other, with the heavy, spermaceti-filled head spaces providing the biological equivalent of a weighted <b>boxing</b> <b>glove.</b> Another proposed factor was the vibrations from repeated sledgehammer blows as the ship's hull was being repaired prior to the attack, which scientists suggest might have carried into the water and unintentionally mimicked the echolocation [...] "clicks" [...] that sperm whales generate to identify and communicate with each other.|$|E
60|$|In short, then, {{what has}} {{happened}} has been the virtual legalization of prizefighting under cover of the <b>boxing</b> <b>glove.</b> And {{this is exactly what}} public opinion desires. We do not like fighting; but we like looking on at fights: therefore we require a law which will punish the prizefighter if he hits us, and secure us the protection of the police whilst we sit in a comfortable hall and watch him hitting another prizefighter. And that is just the law we have got at present.|$|E
60|$|It {{was under}} these {{circumstances}} that the competitors for sparring championships concluded that they had better decide the bouts themselves by knocking their opponents out, and waste no time in cultivating a skill and style for which they got little credit, and which actually set some of the judges against them. The public instantly began to {{take an interest in}} the sport. And so, by a pretty rapid evolution, the dexterities which the <b>boxing</b> <b>glove</b> and the Queensberry rules were supposed to substitute for the old brutalities of Sayers and Heenan were really abolished by them.|$|E

60|$|Beric {{was much}} pleased {{when he heard}} from the master that he {{intended}} to confine his teaching to these two exercises only with regard to his companions; for although men were sometimes seriously hurt by blows given by the masses of leather and lead, which, wound round the fist, were used to give weight to the blows, a final termination to the contests was rare. In the exercises the men practised with many wrappings of wadding and cotton wound round the caestus, answering the purpose of the modern <b>boxing</b> <b>glove.</b> Beric himself was very partial to the exercise, and as it strengthened the muscles, and gave quickness and activity to the limbs, Scopus encouraged him in it.|$|E
60|$|While so engaged, Monsieur and Madame Duburg arrived, {{with their}} daughters, Julie and Justine. Monsieur Duburg--Mrs. Barclay's brother--was {{proprietor}} of a considerable estate, planted almost entirely with vines. His income {{was a large}} one, for the soil was favorable, and he carried on the culture with such care and attention that the wines fetched a higher price than any in the district. He was a clear-headed, sensible man, with a keen eye to a bargain. He was fond of his sister and her English husband, and had offered no opposition to his boys entering into the games and amusements of their cousins--although his wife was constantly urging him to do so. It was, to Madame Duburg, a terrible thing that her boys--instead of being always tidy and orderly, and ready, when at home, to accompany her for a walk--should come home flushed, hot, and untidy, with perhaps a swelled cheek or a black eye, {{from the effects of}} a blow from a cricket ball or <b>boxing</b> <b>glove.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{final step}} {{was taken by}} an American pugilist. He threw off the last shred of the old {{hypocrisy}} of the gloved hand by challenging {{the whole world to}} produce a man who could stand before him for a specified time without being knocked out. His brief but glorious career completely re-established pugilism by giving a world-wide advertisement {{to the fact that the}} <b>boxing</b> <b>glove</b> spares nothing but the public conscience, and that as much ferocity, bloodshed, pain, and risk of serious injury or death can be enjoyed at a glove fight as at an old-fashioned prizefight, whilst the strain on the combatants is much greater. It is true that these horrors are greatly exaggerated by the popular imagination, and that if boxing were really as dangerous as bicycling, a good many of its heroes would give it up from simple fright; but this only means that there is a maximum of damage to the spectator by demoralization, combined with the minimum of deterrent risk to the poor scrapper in the ring.|$|E

60|$|Thus Cashel Byron's {{plea for}} {{a share of}} the legal toleration accorded to the vivisector has been {{virtually}} granted since he made it. The legalization of cruelty to domestic animals under cover of the anesthetic is only the extreme instance of the same social phenomenon as the legalization of prizefighting under cover of the <b>boxing</b> <b>glove.</b> The same passion explains the fascination of both practices; and in both, the professors--pugilists and physiologists alike--have to persuade the Home Office that their pursuits are painless and beneficial. But there is also between them the remarkable difference that the pugilist, who has to suffer as much as he inflicts, wants his work to be as painless and harmless as possible whilst persuading the public that it is thrillingly dangerous and destructive, whilst the vivisector wants to enjoy a total exemption from humane restrictions in his laboratory whilst persuading the public that pain is unknown there. Consequently the vivisector is not only crueller than the prizefighter, but, through the pressure of public opinion, a much more resolute and uncompromising liar. For this no one but a Pharisee will single him out for special blame. All public men lie, as a matter of good taste, on subjects which are considered serious (in England a serious occasion means simply an occasion on which nobody tells the truth); and however illogical or capricious the point of honor may be in man, it is too absurd to assume that the doctors who, from among innumerable methods of research, select that of tormenting animals hideously, will hesitate to come on a platform and tell a soothing fib to prevent the public from punishing them. No criminal is expected to plead guilty, or to refrain from pleading not guilty with all the plausibility at his command. In prizefighting such mendacity is not necessary: on the contrary, if a famous pugilist were to assure the public that a blow delivered with a <b>boxing</b> <b>glove</b> could do no injury and cause no pain, and the public believed him, the sport would instantly lose its following. It is the prizefighter's interest to abolish the real cruelties of the ring and to exaggerate the imaginary cruelties of it. It is the vivisector's interest to refine upon the cruelties of the laboratory, whilst persuading the public that his victims pass into a delicious euthanasia and leave behind them a row of bottles containing infallible cures for all the diseases. Just so, too, does the trainer of performing animals assure us that his dogs and cats and elephants and lions are taught their senseless feats by pure kindness.|$|E
6000|$|In 1882, {{when this}} book was written, prizefighting seemed to be dying out. Sparring matches with boxing gloves, under the Queensberry rules, kept pugilism faintly alive; {{but it was not}} popular, because the public, which cares only for the {{excitement}} of a strenuous fight, believed then that the <b>boxing</b> <b>glove</b> made sparring as harmless a contest of pure skill as a fencing match with buttoned foils. This delusion was supported by the limitation of the sparring match to boxing. In the prize-ring under the old rules a combatant might trip, hold, or throw his antagonist; so that each round finished either with a knockdown blow, which, except when it is really a liedown blow, is much commoner in fiction {{than it was in the}} ring, or with a visible body-to-body struggle ending in a fall. In a sparring match all that happens is that a man with a watch in his hand cries out [...] "Time!" [...] whereupon the two champions prosaically stop sparring and sit down for a minute's rest and refreshment. The unaccustomed and inexpert spectator in those days did not appreciate the severity of the exertion or the risk of getting hurt: he underrated them as ignorantly as he would have overrated the more dramatically obvious terrors of a prizefight. Consequently the interest in the annual sparrings for the Queensberry Championships was confined to the few amateurs who had some critical knowledge of the game of boxing, and to the survivors of the generation for which the fight between Sayers and Heenan had been described in The Times as solemnly as the University Boat Race. In short, pugilism was out of fashion because the police had suppressed the only form of it which fascinated the public by its undissembled pugnacity.|$|E
6000|$|In the old prize-ring a round had no fixed duration. It was {{terminated}} {{by the fall}} of one of the combatants (in practice usually both of them), and was followed by an interval of half a minute for recuperation. The practical effect of this was that a combatant could always get a respite of half a minute whenever he wanted it by pretending to be knocked down: [...] "finding the earth the safest place," [...] as the old phrase went. For this the Marquess of Queensberry substituted a rule that a round with the gloves should last a specified time, usually three or four minutes, and that a combatant who did not stand up to his opponent continuously during that time (ten seconds being allowed for rising {{in the event of a}} knock-down) lost the battle. That unobtrusively slipped-in ten seconds limit has produced the modern glove fight. Its practical effect is that a man dazed by a blow or a fall for, say, twelve seconds, which would not have mattered in an old-fashioned fight with its thirty seconds interval,[1] has under the Queensberry rules either to lose or else stagger to his feet in a helpless condition and be eagerly battered into insensibility by his opponent before he can recover his powers of self-defence. The notion that such a battery cannot be inflicted with boxing gloves is only entertained by people who have never used them or seen them used. I may say that I have myself received, in an accident, a blow in the face, involving two macadamized holes in it, more violent than the most formidable pugilist could have given me with his bare knuckles. This blow did not stun or disable me even momentarily. On the other hand, I have seen a man knocked quite silly by a tap from the most luxurious sort of <b>boxing</b> <b>glove</b> made, wielded by a quite unathletic literary man sparring for the first time in his life. The human jaw, like the human elbow, is provided, as every boxer knows, with a [...] "funny bone"; and the pugilist who is lucky enough to jar that funny bone with a blow practically has his opponent at his mercy for at least ten seconds. Such a blow is called a [...] "knock-out." [...] The funny bone and the ten-seconds rule explain the development of Queensberry sparring into the modern knocking-out match or glove fight.|$|E
