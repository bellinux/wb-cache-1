2500|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>walleye</b> became {{extinct in}} the Great Lakes in the 1980s. [...] Until {{the middle of}} the 20th century, it was a commercially {{valuable}} fish, with about a half million tonnes being landed during the period from about 1880 to the late 1950s, when the populations collapsed, apparently through a combination of overfishing, anthropogenic eutrophication, and competition with the introduced rainbow smelt.|$|E
2500|$|Up {{until the}} end of the 1950s, the most {{commonly}} caught commercial fish (more than 50% of the commercial catch) was a subspecies of the walleye known as the <b>blue</b> <b>walleye</b> (Sander vitreus glaucus) sometimes erroneously called [...] "blue pike". In the 1970s and 1980s, as pollution in the lake declined, counts of walleyes which were caught grew from 112,000 in 1975 to 4.1 million in 1985, with estimates of the numbers of walleyes in the lake at around 33 million in the basin, with many of 8 pounds or more. Not all walleyes thrived. The combination of overfishing and the eutrophication of the lake by pollution caused the population to collapse, and in the mid-1980s, one species of walleye called the <b>blue</b> <b>walleye</b> was declared extinct. But the Lake Erie walleye was reportedly having record numbers, even in 1989, according to one report. There have been concerns about rising levels of mercury in walleye fish; a study by the Canadian Ministry of the Environment noted an [...] "increasing concentration trend" [...] but that limits were within acceptable established by authorities in Pennsylvania. It was recommended, because of PCBs, that persons eat no more than one walleye meal per month. Because of these and other concerns, in 1990, the National Wildlife Federation was on the verge of having a [...] "negative fish consumption advisory" [...] for walleyes and smallmouth bass, which had been the bread-and-butter catch of an $800 million commercial fishing industry.|$|E
50|$|There are {{occasional}} {{reports of}} <b>blue</b> <b>walleye</b> being caught from {{waters in the}} Great Lakes Basin, because many yellow walleye populations also contain a bluish colour variant. The actual <b>blue</b> <b>walleye,</b> however, {{was said to be}} distinguishable from the yellow walleye by various meristics and morphometrics which the blue colour variant of the yellow walleye seems not to share. Reportedly, though, some of the meristic and morphometric differences may simply have been artifacts of the different growth rates of yellow and blue walleyes. The clearest evidence, however, indicates that the <b>blue</b> <b>walleye,</b> whatever its taxonomic status, has been lost. Nonetheless, an investigation of genetic material from preserved <b>blue</b> <b>walleye</b> specimens is currently underway in several research facilities in an effort to decipher the true status of the populations.|$|E
50|$|Common {{freshwater}} {{targets are}} trout, salmon, perch, chub, Bream, pike, <b>Walleye,</b> <b>Blue</b> Kurper and Bass.|$|R

50|$|To date, {{none of the}} bluish-coloured walleyes {{recently}} captured {{has been}} shown to be a <b>blue</b> <b>walleye,</b> although at least one organization in the US is offering a reward for successful capture of a <b>blue</b> <b>walleye</b> specimen. A United States Fish and Wildlife Service recovery plan in the mid-1970s was unable to find any certain evidence of the blue walleye's existence at that time. Nine purported blue walleyes captured in 1975, including a number of gravid females, were inconclusive as to their subspecific designation and failed to produce any viable offspring through artificial propagation. The last known blue walleyes, to any degree of certainty, were captured in about 1983 from lakes Erie and Ontario. Subsequent exhaustive efforts to find a relict population have been entirely unsuccessful. The loss of the <b>blue</b> <b>walleye</b> is, arguably, an extinction event on par with the loss of the passenger pigeon and the near-extirpation of the American bison. Where once the subspecies numbered in the millions, all are now gone.|$|E

50|$|Walleye (Sander vitreus, synonym Stizostedion vitreum) is a {{freshwater}} perciform fish {{native to}} most of Canada and to the Northern United States. It is a North American close relative of the European Zander, {{also known as the}} pikeperch. The walleye is sometimes called the yellow walleye to distinguish it from the <b>blue</b> <b>walleye,</b> which is a subspecies that was once found in the southern Ontario and Quebec regions, but are now presumed extinct. However, recent genetic analysis of a preserved (frozen) 'blue walleye' sample suggests that the blue and yellow walleye were simply phenotypes within the same species and do not merit separate taxonomic classification.|$|E
