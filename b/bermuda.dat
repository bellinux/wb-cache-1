5|$|After retiring, Goater {{returned}} to <b>Bermuda,</b> receiving an official welcome from the Premier of <b>Bermuda</b> Alex Scott on his arrival. A week later, Southend played the <b>Bermuda</b> national team in an appreciation game for their former striker. Goater has expressed a wish to enter coaching following his retirement, and studied for the UEFA B coaching licence in 2005. Since 2003, Goater has organised the annual Shaun Goater Grass-roots Soccer Festival, a football coaching event {{for children in}} <b>Bermuda.</b> On 14 September 2006, Goater and the United Soccer Leagues announced that <b>Bermuda</b> would receive a professional football team that would play in the third division of American football, the USL Second Division. Goater had roles as both a director and player of the team, the <b>Bermuda</b> Hogges. Goater left <b>Bermuda</b> Hogges in 2008, to concentrate on youth coaching with North Village Rams in his home town.|$|E

5|$|Several {{days prior}} to Fabian {{striking}} <b>Bermuda,</b> computer models forecast a ridge of high pressure forcing the hurricane {{to the west of}} the island by 200miles (320km). Not expected to be a direct threat, a meteorologist at the <b>Bermuda</b> Weather Service expected gusty winds and potentially heavy rainfall. Each successive advisory brought the hurricane steadily closer to <b>Bermuda,</b> and 35hours before Fabian made its closest approach, the <b>Bermuda</b> Weather Service issued a hurricane watch for the island. When a track near <b>Bermuda</b> became more certain, a hurricane warning was issued for the island, approximately 29hours before Fabian made a direct hit on the island.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm George {{originated}} on September27 from {{a strong}} tropical wave {{northeast of the}} Lesser Antilles and southeast of <b>Bermuda.</b> A large system, it moved to the northwest and later west-northwest. George began strengthening on September30 as it decreased its forward speed. The next day, while remaining nearly stationary south of <b>Bermuda,</b> a nearby ship reported that George had reached hurricane status. It continued moving very slowly, passing only 100mi (160km) south of <b>Bermuda.</b> The island experienced winds of 30 to 40mph (40 to 65km/h). Aside from rainbands, little impact was reported on <b>Bermuda.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for <b>Bermuda</b> on August 25, and ultimately discontinued {{about three days}} later. Two cruise ships left <b>Bermuda</b> early to avoid the storm, and another two postponed their scheduled stops there. The threat of the storm, combined {{with a lack of}} passengers due to cruise ship diversions, resulted in the suspension of ferry service. Cristobal ultimately passed well to the northwest of the island, producing breezy conditions and heightened surf.|$|E
5|$|According to the <b>Bermuda</b> Weather Service, {{the islands}} of <b>Bermuda</b> {{experience}} a damaging tropical cyclone once every six to seven years, on average. Due to the small area of the island chain, landfalls and direct hits are rare. Strictly speaking, only nine landfalls have occurred during years included in the official Atlantic hurricane database, starting in 1851. When hurricanes Fay and Gonzalo struck <b>Bermuda</b> just days apart in October 2014, that season became the first to produce two landfalls. Two damaging storms impacted <b>Bermuda</b> in September 1899, but {{the center of the}} first storm narrowly missed the islands. Tropical cyclones, and their antecedent or remnant weather systems, have affected the territory in all seasons, most frequently in the late summer months. A study of recorded storms from 1609 to 1996 found that direct hits from hurricanes were most common in early September and late October, with an intervening relative lull creating two distinct 'seasons'.|$|E
5|$|After Hurricane Fay caused {{extensive}} {{power outages}} {{on the island}} just days before, residents of <b>Bermuda</b> were forced to complete preparations for Gonzalo in haste. Banks, businesses, schools, and government offices closed {{in advance of the}} storm, while the Royal Navy ship HMS Argyll left its post in the Caribbean to provide <b>Bermuda</b> with emergency assistance. The cyclone gradually weakened before crossing directly over central <b>Bermuda</b> at Category 2 strength around 00:30 UTC on October 18. Gonzalo battered the island with wind gusts as high as , downing hundreds of trees and creating widespread roof damage. At the height of the storm, about 31,000 out of 36,000 total electricity customers were without power; service was not fully restored until early November. Many roads were impassable immediately following the hurricane, and in many cases the damage done by Gonzalo was indistinguishable from that of Fay. <b>Bermuda</b> Regiment soldiers and sailors from the Argyll took part in initial cleanup and repairs on the territory, and preliminary assessments revealed that the storm did not compare to the devastation of Hurricane Fabian in 2003. Catastrophe modelling firms estimated that <b>Bermuda</b> suffered up to $400million in losses, and despite the heavy disruptions, no deaths or serious injuries were reported there.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Humberto was a {{moderately}} powerful hurricane that briefly affected <b>Bermuda</b> in September 2001. It was the eighth named storm of the season, {{as well as}} the fourth hurricane. It formed on September 21 between Puerto Rico and <b>Bermuda,</b> partially related to previous Hurricane Gabrielle. Humberto passed about 140 miles (225km) west of <b>Bermuda,</b> which spared the island with its strongest winds. After weakening and believed {{to be on the verge}} of dissipating, Humberto unexpectedly restrengthened to the southeast of Atlantic Canada. The intensification was short-lived and the storm dissipated on September 27. There were a series of significant observational flights into the hurricane that produced a wealth of data on the structure of hurricanes.|$|E
