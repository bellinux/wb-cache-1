Critical players over this half decade included receiver Arland Bruce III, defensive star Byron Parker, and all-star punter Noel Prefontaine. The team generated some controversy in 2006 when they lured running back Ricky Williams from the NFL. Williams had repeatedly violated NFL drug policies and was under suspension for the year; he played just one season with the Argos.|$|E
5|$|According to the Gallup Organization, Obama {{began his}} {{presidency}} with a 68% approval rating before gradually declining {{for the rest}} of the year, and eventually <b>bottoming</b> out at 41% in August 2010, a trend similar to Ronald Reagan's and Bill Clinton's first years in office. He experienced a small poll bounce shortly after the death of Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011. This bounce lasted until around June 2011, when his approval numbers dropped back to where they were previously. His approval ratings rebounded around the same time as his reelection in 2012, with polls showing an average job approval of 52% shortly after his second inauguration. Despite approval ratings dropping to 39% in late-2013 due to the ACA roll-out, they climbed to 50% in January 2015 according to Gallup.|$|E
5|$|Button {{scored the}} car's first points in Monaco, with an eighth-place finish. He later {{attributed}} the result to having {{confidence in the}} car, noting that he could raise the ride height at {{the front end of}} the car and brake heavily without locking the brakes or <b>bottoming</b> out and hitting the road, but without compromising the performance of the car when turning in to the apex of a corner. However, in the following races in Canada and Austria, the team's struggles came to a head as they were forced to reduce the power output of the engine to levels that had not been used since Australia, and could not therefore provide a competitive package for the long straights and slow corners of the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve and Red Bull Ring. In addition, with their arrival in Austria, both Button and Alonso had used up their quota of engine components for the season, which combined with unscheduled gearbox changes, resulted in both drivers receiving twenty-five place grid penalties. The team also introduced their first major aerodynamic updates for the season, replacing the snub nose of the original design with a squared-off front end similar to the designs of the Williams FW37 and Red Bull RB11. The rear of the floor was also revised, with a series of slots cut into the body in front of the rear wheels to change the air pressure flowing towards the diffuser. The team only saw limited running as Alonso retired on the opening lap after a collision with Kimi Räikkönen, but they were able to assess the new design at a post-race test. After enduring four consecutive retirements, Alonso scored his first point of the season with a tenth-place finish in Great Britain.|$|E

5|$|When {{thermoplastics}} are moulded, typically pelletised {{raw material}} is fed through a hopper into a heated barrel with a reciprocating screw. Upon {{entrance to the}} barrel, the temperature increases and the Van der Waals forces that resist relative flow of individual chains are weakened {{as a result of}} increased space between molecules at higher thermal energy states. This process reduces its viscosity, which enables the polymer to flow with the driving force of the injection unit. The screw delivers the raw material forward, mixes and homogenises the thermal and viscous distributions of the polymer, and reduces the required heating time by mechanically shearing the material and adding a significant amount of frictional heating to the polymer. The material feeds forward through a check valve and collects {{at the front of the}} screw into a volume known as a shot. A shot is the volume of material that is used to fill the mould cavity, compensate for shrinkage, and provide a cushion (approximately 10% of the total shot volume, which remains in the barrel and prevents the screw from <b>bottoming</b> out) to transfer pressure from the screw to the mould cavity. When enough material has gathered, the material is forced at high pressure and velocity into the part forming cavity. To prevent spikes in pressure, the process normally uses a transfer position corresponding to a 95–98% full cavity where the screw shifts from a constant velocity to a constant pressure control. Often injection times are well under 1 second. Once the screw reaches the transfer position the packing pressure is applied, which completes mould filling and compensates for thermal shrinkage, which is quite high for thermoplastics relative to many other materials. The packing pressure is applied until the gate (cavity entrance) solidifies. Due to its small size, the gate is normally the first place to solidify through its entire thickness. Once the gate solidifies, no more material can enter the cavity; accordingly, the screw reciprocates and acquires material for the next cycle while the material within the mould cools so that it can be ejected and be dimensionally stable. This cooling duration is dramatically reduced by the use of cooling lines circulating water or oil from an external temperature controller. Once the required temperature has been achieved, the mould opens and an array of pins, sleeves, strippers, etc. are driven forward to demould the article. Then, the mould closes and the process is repeated.|$|E

Transfer of heat energy from high temperature exhaust gas to water and steam takes place by a waste heat recovery boiler in the <b>bottoming</b> cycle.

In 2000, daytime viewership of the network peaked at 343,000, around the time the Nasdaq Composite crossed 5000.

From the bottom, the network, along with the markets, rebounded significantly – average daytime viewership (6 a.m. to 6 p.m.) reached a 7-year high of 310,000 viewers {{in the first quarter}} of 2008. Coinciding with the extreme market volatility of the ongoing global economic crisis, ratings hit an all-time high of 416,000 in Q3. Although the figures remain considerably less than those achieved by Fox News and CNN today, it has still had a 210% increase in viewership since the beginning of 2005. Despite the viewership slump at the turn of the decade, CNBC has remained extremely profitable: average annual revenues top $500 million while profits for the network exceeded $333 million in 2007, making CNBC a cash cow for NBC Universal and its parent company, Comcast.
