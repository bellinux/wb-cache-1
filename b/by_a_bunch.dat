25|$|There {{is also a}} {{well-known}} Romanian legend about {{a young man named}} Dragoș Vodă who went hunting for an aurochs or a wisent, followed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> of dogs. During the hunting expedition, all the dogs got tired and fell down, except for a female dog named Molda which ran to the wild animal all the time. After the wisent entered into a river, the female dog did the same thing, but unfortunately it got drowned and died in that way. Thanks to Molda, Dragoș finally killed the wisent and cut its head off, and in memory of his dog's sacrifice, he named the river and the land after MOLda – MOLdovA. That legend, which is a fictional story, explains the name of the territory and country's etymology and also explains why the symbol of Moldova is the wisent head.|$|E

Thompson also said, [...] "the 'social commentary' on this album is akin to a sociopath's discharging his AK-47 into a crowded schoolyard, with the machine gun bursts interrupted by Pee-wee Herman's views on politics".|$|E

500|$|A recent {{nickname}} for Town is [...] "The Tractor Boys", which was coined during the club's brief {{period in the}} Premiership (2000–01 and 2001–02) when the team regularly competed against more fashionable clubs. The nickname {{is an example of}} self-deprecating humour referring to Ipswich's agricultural heritage. The origins of the nickname are not certain, but the first generally accepted use of the nickname was created whilst playing at Leeds United in 2000–2001: Ipswich were winning the game 2–1 and the Leeds fans started chanting, 'We're being beaten <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> of tractor drivers.' Barracking by supporters of more established Premiership clubs during Town's spell in the Premiership lent the ironic chant '1–0 to the Tractor Boys' increased potency and publicity, and the nickname is commonly used by the media. Former Town manager Jim Magilton commented, in the local press, that he disliked the nickname and said that it conjured up, 'images of carrot-crunching yokels', while players such as Matt Holland accepted the chant with good humour.|$|E

40|$|International audienceHigh {{gradients}} {{of energy}} gain and {{high energy efficiency}} are necessary parameters for compact, cost-efficient and high-energy particle colliders. Plasma Wakefield Accelerators (PWFA) offer both, making them attractive candidates for next-generation colliders. In these devices, a charge-density plasma wave is excited <b>by</b> <b>an</b> ultra-relativistic <b>bunch</b> of charged particles (the drive bunch). The energy in the wave can be extracted <b>by</b> <b>a</b> second <b>bunch</b> (the trailing bunch), as this bunch propagates {{in the wake of}} the drive <b>bunch.</b> While <b>a</b> trailing electron <b>bunch</b> was accelerated in a plasma with more than a gigaelectronvolt of energy gain, accelerating <b>a</b> trailing positron <b>bunch</b> in <b>a</b> plasma is much more challenging as the plasma response can be asymmetric for positrons and electrons. We report the demonstration of the energy gain <b>by</b> <b>a</b> distinct trailing positron <b>bunch</b> in <b>a</b> plasma wakefield accelerator, spanning nonlinear to quasi-linear regimes, and unveil the beam loading process underlying the accelerator energy efficiency. <b>A</b> positron <b>bunch</b> is used to drive the plasma wake in the experiment, though the quasi-linear wake structure could as easily be formed <b>by</b> <b>an</b> electron <b>bunch</b> or <b>a</b> laser driver.

Williams described the song as being [...] "not unlike 'Bohemian Rhapsody' being played backwards <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> of Vietnam vets high on Kings Cross-quality crack".

Their personality, their characters, were very well-written, and so, the superstar in the film was Shahrukh Khan, who was the coach of the team; he doesn't sort of take over the whole film.
