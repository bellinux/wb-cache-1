50|$|The video cardotherwise {{called a}} {{graphics}} card, graphics adapter or video adapterprocesses the graphics output from the motherboard and transmits {{it to the}} display. It {{is an essential part}} of modern multimedia-enriched computing. On older models, and today on budget models, graphics circuitry may be integrated with the motherboard, but for modern and flexible machines, they are connected by the PCI, AGP, or PCI Express interface. When the IBM PC was introduced, most existing <b>business-oriented</b> personal <b>computers</b> used text-only display adapters and had no graphics capability. Home computers at that time had graphics compatible with television signals, but with low resolution by modern standards owing to the limited memory available to the eight-bit processors available at the time.|$|R
