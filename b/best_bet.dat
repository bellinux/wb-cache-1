25|$|By {{this time}} the world was in the thralls of an energy crisis. Beginning in 1973, {{the members of the}} Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries had taken {{advantage}} of tight world oil supplies to rapidly and regularly increase prices. Policy-makers in the oil consuming countries therefore considered it a matter of national urgency to develop stable, secure energy supplies. Because the resource was so large and development was clearly possible, the oil sands looked like Canada's <b>best</b> <b>bet.</b> As a result, the prospect that the Syncrude project would collapse was a matter of both political and economic concern.|$|E
25|$|The {{particular}} synthetic CDO {{that the}} SEC's 2010 fraud suit charged Goldman with misleading investors with was called Abacus 2007-AC1. Unlike {{many of the}} Abacus securities, 2007-AC1 did not have Goldman Sachs as a short seller, in fact, Goldman Sachs lost money on the deal. That position {{was taken by the}} customer (John Paulson) who hired Goldman to issue the security (according to the SEC's complaint). Paulson and his employees selected 90 BBB-rated mortgage bonds that they believed were most likely to lose value and so the <b>best</b> <b>bet</b> to buy insurance for. Paulson and the manager of the CDO, ACA Management, worked on the portfolio of 90 bonds to be insured (ACA allegedly unaware of Paulson's short position), coming to an agreement in late February 2007. Paulson paid Goldman approximately US$15 million for its work in the deal. Paulson ultimately made a US$1 billion profit from the short investments, the profits coming from the losses of the investors and their insurers. These were primarily IKB Deutsche Industriebank (US$150 million loss), and the investors and insurers of another US$900 million—ACA Financial Guaranty Corp, ABN AMRO, and the Royal Bank of Scotland.|$|E
25|$|The two started wearing {{identical}} {{outfits and}} develop the ”Fun loving pretty boy” gimmick they would be known for throughout their time together. After wrestling on {{the lower end of}} the card to get the fans familiar with the team the Midnight Rockers soon moved onto a feud with the team of Doug Somers and Buddy Rose who at the time were one of the top teams in the promotion. Their initial outing with Somers and Rose at the WrestleRock stadium show on April 20, 1986 did not go well for Jannetty and Michaels who lost in front of 22,000 fans. When Somers and Rose beat Scott Hall and Curt Hennig for the AWA World Tag Team Championship the Midnight Rockers suddenly found themselves chasing the main tag team title of the promotion. The Midnight Rockers teamed up with Curt Hennig to defeat Somer, Rose and Alexis Smirnoff at ”Battle by the Bay” on June 28, 1986 to prove that they were indeed capable of beating the champions. The Midnight Rockers would repeatedly challenge Somers throughout the rest of 1986 but never quite be able to get the win when the title was on the line. Finally near the end of that year, Jannetty and Michaels defeated the champions in a ”non-title” Steel cage match on December 25, 1986 on the AWA’s ”Brawl in St. Paul” show. A month later on January 27 1987 the Midnight Rockers defeated Rose and Somers for the AWA Tag Team title. Jannetty and Michaels realized that the AWA was a promotion in decline, in fact it would shut down completely by 1990, and they decided that their <b>best</b> <b>bet</b> was to work for the WWF. The Midnight Rockers got an offer from Vince McMahon while holding the AWA Tag Title. The Midnight Rockers even signed with the WWF while still holding the gold, necessitating the quick title change to the unproven duo of Boris Zhukov and Soldat Ustinov on May 25, 1987.|$|E

Hightower also cited that [...] "when you win at slots, the camera always goes {{to the bottom of the}} machine to show you the payout scale" [...] which [...] "becomes frustrating after a few credits because it is so slow. The act of leaving the table or machine is even slower". He also said that the advice the game gives you is [...] "Perhaps the most irritating 'feature' of this game" [...] because [...] "Each time you do something the computer wouldn't have done, a pop-up screen will appear that adds more time to the lengthy procedure of completing a bet". Hightower commented that [...] "The above-par graphics are quickly negated by the rock-bottom enjoyment factor" [...] and that [...] "this game doesn't have any of the character the real casino has".|$|E

2500|$|In April 1940 he {{was traded}} to the Detroit Lions in {{exchange}} for two rookie players. However, Smukler decided to leave football and join the United States Army. He said, “I got $3,000 a year for playing football professionally. It was great during the season. Everybody shook your hand, slapped you on the back, and told you what a swell fellow you were. But the rest of the time, I couldn’t get a job.” Between football seasons Smukler could only make money doing piecework as a glove cutter. “It was enough to discourage any man, and I kept thinking about what I was going to do when I couldn’t play football anymore.

2500|$|Maus {{was born}} and raised in Austin, Minnesota. As a teenager, he listened mainly to Nirvana and Syd Barrett. In 1998, he began his {{undergraduate}} in music composition at the California Institute of the Arts, by which time he had formed an appreciation for experimental music, such as the work of Michael Pisaro, as well as Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque music. When he befriended and began to work alongside classmate Ariel Pink (Ariel Rosenberg), he took a greater interest in pop music. The first time he heard Rosenberg play was at a concert put up by students from the visual arts department. He recalls thinking: [...] "You know, Okay, maybe I’m not going to do experimental music anymore, because I was ... doing all of these performances like [...] Feldman and [...] Cage. ... I left that aside and took up pop as the <b>best</b> <b>bet,</b> largely because of my encounter there with Ariel, and the early work he was doing." [...] After they became roommates, he recorded the material from his first album using a cassette multi-track recorder and an early 1990s synthesizer soundbank. He later completed his degree in experimental music composition in 2003.|$|E
2500|$|According to Philip D. Kenneson, to be [...] "religious" [...] conveys an {{institutional}} connotation, {{usually associated with}} Abrahamic traditions: to attend worship services, to say Mass, to light Hanukkah candles. To be [...] "spiritual," [...] in contrast, connotes personal practice and personal empowerment {{having to do with}} the deepest motivations of life. As a result, in cultures that are deeply suspicious of institutional structures and that place a high value on individual freedom and autonomy, spirituality has come to have largely positive connotations, while religion has been viewed more negatively. Abrahamic religions have been viewed as negative institutions because they propagate a certain way of believing. Abrahamic traditions emphasize that one’s <b>best</b> <b>bet</b> is to look outside to a higher power that can guide and correct one's corporeal misjudgements. In these traditions, God above is the source of wisdom and illumination. Robert Wuthnow argues that spirituality is about much more than going to church and agreeing or disagreeing with church doctrines. Scholar Robert Wuthnow argues that spirituality is the shorthand term used in Western society to talk about a person's relationship with God. For many people, how they think about religion and spirituality is certainly guided by what they see and do in their congregations. At a deeper level, it involves a person's self-identity—feeling loved by God, and these feelings can wax and wane.|$|E

40|$|The {{experience}} from five national environmental agreement schemes, all about energy efficiency in manufacturing industries, {{is discussed in}} relation to the potential for similar action at the European Community level. Agreements at the Community level could have significant advantages.
