40|$|An {{inhibition}} {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) for {{the detection}} of bovine rennet whey (BRW) solids in skim milk <b>powders</b> (SMP) and <b>buttermilk</b> <b>powders</b> is presented. The BRW content was determined in a neutralised trichloroacetic acid sample extract by binding of the dissolved caseinomacropeptide to an enzyme-labelled anti-bovine-¿-casein monoclonal antibody. Calibration curves were constructed by analysing SMP standards with different known concentrations of BRW (0 ¿ 5. 8 % (w/w)). The assay has a limit of detection of 0. 1 % (w/w) BRW powder in SMP and has high repeatability and reliability. The ELISA reached the sensitivity required for screening to conform with European Union (EU) legislation. It is easy to use, has a short assay time and is of low cost. The successful applicability of this new screening assay was demonstrated in comparison with chromatographic methods imposed by the EU, where 60 industrial samples taken by the Dutch General Inspection Service were analysed...|$|R
40|$|The climates of {{many areas}} in Asia, Central America, the Middle East and Africa make it {{difficult}} to support a dairy industry based on fresh milk. In these areas the shelf life of fresh, undried milk products is short. Concentrated and dry milk products have increased storage stability because of a lower water activity and are therefore desirable in regions with such climatic conditions. Concentrated milk products are obtained from milk by the application of one or a combination of water removal techniques. Drying of these products can reduce the water content to below 3 %. The reduction in water content of milk will increase shelf life and reduce transportation costs. This is particularly important for manufacturers that export products to distant markets. These products may be recombined (water and a combination of ingredients added) or reconstituted (just water added) and then packed and sold by a food retailer, or sold directly to the consumer as a dry or concentrated product, e. g. whole milk powder (WMP) or canned evaporated milk. The range of concentrated and spray-dried dairy powders commercially produced today is wide and includes ultra-high-temperature (UHT) treated concentrated milks, in-can sterilised milks, skim milk powder, WMP, formulated infant food powders, high protein powders and high fat <b>powders,</b> whey <b>powders,</b> <b>buttermilk</b> <b>powders,</b> cream powders, casein and caseinates.

Cheese making commenced at the factory in late 1942 in response to wartime demand, as occurred at the Kingaroy, Nanango and Wondai butter factories. While cheese making ended during or shortly after the war at most of these places, Murgon maintained this production until the 1990s. In 1948 pasteurised bottled milk sales commenced and in 1953, the earliest part of the complex was remodelled and a modern pasteurisation and bottling plant was installed. In 1950 the office was re-established in new brick and concrete premises opposite the factory in Macalister St, with the former office building operating as the co-operative's trading arm from 1951.

40|$|Milk fat is {{encapsulated}} in a {{milk fat}} globule membrane (MFGM) that contains bioactive glycoproteins and glycolipids. The MFGM inhibits infectivity of rotavirus (RV), activity {{that has been}} attributed to its glycoprotein and carbohydrate components. However, previous studies of proteins and oligosaccharides in the MGFM have not accounted for all the bioactivity associated with the complete MFGM. The lipid fraction of the MFGM accounts for half of its composition by weight, and we postulate that this fraction should be tested by itself to determine if it plays a role in antiviral activity. Herein, the anti-RV activity of an organic extract of MFGM was tested. Natural and whey <b>buttermilk</b> <b>powders</b> containing bovine MFGM enriched in polar lipids were prepared by microfiltration and supercritical fluid extraction treatment to reduce the triglyceride content of the powders. Lipid fractions were then extracted from the MFGM using both single- and dual-phase extraction methods. Whole MFGM and organic extracts were screened in MA- 104 cells for anti-infective activity against a neuraminidase-sensitive rotavirus using a focus- forming unit assay. Dose-dependent inhibition was observed for whole buttermilk and cheese whey MFGM against the rotavirus. In general, buttermilk MFGM exhibited greater RV percentage inhibition than cheese whey MFGM. Organic-soluble anti-RV compounds were identified in bovine MFGM. The most active fraction, isolated by dual-phase extraction and iatrobead chromatography, was free of proteins and highly nonpolar. Further separation of this fraction in a less polar solvent (30 : 1 chloroform:methanol) resolved at least 5 lipid-containing compounds, which likely contribute to the anti-RV activity associated with bovine MFGM. In summary, lipid components associated with MFGM appear to contribute {{in large part to the}} anti-RV activity associated with the bovine MFGM...|$|R

40|$|Almost 16 % of milk {{produced}} in European Union is being converted to butter. Buttermilk, {{is a low}} cost by-product from butter manufacture and available in large quantities but has been considered invaluable for many years. When cream is churned to butter the stable oil in water emulsion is destabilized and milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) is disrupted which is released in buttermilk. Thus, {{over the last two}} decades it has gained considerable attention due to its specific composition (proteins and polar lipids) attributed towards the MFGM.

Reducing initial adherence of such bacteria to teeth may delay onset of caries. Many foods, such as milk, can inhibit microbial adherence. In this investigation, the effect of untreated (UT) and enzyme-treated (ET) dairy powders on adherence of S. sobrinus and S. salivarius to hydroxylapatite (HA), an analogue of tooth enamel, was examined.

This study firstly compares the effect of untreated (UT) and enzyme-treated (ET) dairy powders on the adherence of S. mutans to hydroxylapatite (HA), an analogue of tooth enamel. A fluorescence-based method was used to quantify adherence of S. mutans to HA both in the presence (S-HA) and absence (PBS-HA) of saliva. Secondly, binding of proteins present in the test materials to HA was quantified using bicinchonic acid assays and SDS-PAGE. In addition, the effect of UT and ET dairy powders on growth of S. mutans was examined using an optical-density based assay.

40|$|Practically {{all of the}} 85, 000 hogs on {{the farms}} of Utah (as of August 1, 1934) are in the {{irrigated}} sections of the state where they fit in well with dairying. Utah, however, is a hog-deficient area and produces about 109, 000 hogs less than are slaughtered in the state for its own use. Large amounts of milk by-products such as skim milk, buttermilk, and whey are produced in Utah. Large amounts of alfalfa are also grown in the irrigated sections, thus providing excellent pasture for the growing out and feeding of market hogs. Barley is the principal feeding grain grown in this state. Much wheat, however, is grown, which {{in recent years has}} been fed extensively to livestock. The production and fattening of hogs in conjunction with dairy-farming has proved to be well adapted to the agricultural program in large dairy centers. By furnishing a ready market for dairy by-products (skimmilk, buttermilk, and whey), hogs help to strengthen the dairy industry, while home-grown grains and leguminous pastures complete an adequate swine-growing and fattening ration for hogs raised on the farm.

For comparison, a fat-free variant without TG or BMP and a full-fat yogurt were studied. Monitoring the pH drop during incubation time revealed that TG did not interfere with the pH reduction, while BMP addition accelerated the decline in pH. TG treatment or BMP addition substantially improved the water holding capacity functionality of the yogurt gel. Electrophoretic analysis revealed that the addition of BMP enhanced the reactivity of TG as indicated by the appearance of high molecular weight protein polymer bands. These results were confirmed by scanning electron microscope analysis. The addition of TG and BMP, either individually or in combination, showed a marked impact on gel network, resulting in a more compact and dense gel structure accompanied by irregular agglomerated clusters of protein aggregates. Fat-free yogurts of individually BMP addition exhibited the most desirable organoleptic attributes as indicated by a sensory panel and were perceived as similar to the full-fat yogurt perception. Overall, the addition of TG or BMP appeared to have potential as a valuable alternative in fat-free yogurt production, and BMP can be used as a source of extra protein, which in turn offers promising option to develop innovative functional fat-free yogurt...|$|E
40|$|Milk {{fat globule}} {{membrane}} (MFGM), {{due to its}} specific nature and composition, is known as material possessing advantageous nutritional as well as technological properties. In this study MFGM materials were produced from several dairy sources such as buttermilk (BM), butter serum (BS) and buttermilk whey (BMW) by microfiltration (MF). The obtained materials, depending on the sources, were called BM-MFGM, BS-MFGM and BMW-MFGM, respectively. The compositions of starting materials and the isolated MFGM materials {{as well as their}} emulsifying properties were analyzed and compared. As expected, the MF resulted in enrichment of polar lipids (PLs), major components of MFGM. On dry matter basis, BM-MFGM and BS-MFGM were about 2. 5 times higher in PLs compared to their beginning materials while BMW-MFGM was about 8. 3 times compared to <b>buttermilk</b> <b>powder</b> (BMP).

Emulsions of 35 % soya oil in water were prepared with the mentioned materials using a homogenizer at various pressures. Generally, emulsions prepared with BMP and butter serum powder had significantly higher particle sizes than those prepared with the MFGM materials.

In this study, a material enriched in MFGM fragments was isolated from a reconstituted solution of <b>buttermilk</b> <b>powder</b> (BMP) using microfiltration. The emulsifying properties of this MFGM material, which is also called BMP MFGM, was investigated in comparison {{with those of the}} original material, BMP, and skim milk powder (SMP). Mixtures of 35 % soybean oil were prepared in water and were supplemented with BMP MFGM, BMP or SMP at the same concentration of total protein (2. 3 g/ 100 g product). The oil-in-water emulsions from the mixtures were made at five different two-step homogenization pressures (0 / 20; 30 / 20; 90 / 20; 150 / 20 and 210 / 20 bar). Emulsions prepared with BMP MFGM showed good stability at pressures above 30 / 20 bar. The measurement of particle size distribution and microscopy observation indicated the occurrence of the aggregation of emulsion droplets, especially at high homogenization pressures, when BMP or SMP were used. With the use of BMP MFGM, no such aggregation was observed. For all samples, the average droplet diameters decreased with increasing pressures. At 210 / 20 bar, emulsions prepared with MFGM BMP showed a monomodal particle size distribution with an average droplet size of about 0. 7 µm, which was significantly smaller than that of emulsions made with BMP and SMP. In conclusion, BMP MFGM had superior emulsifying properties compared to the other two materials. This difference could be (mostly) attributed to the difference in composition of the three materials of which BMP MFGM contained highest concentration of phospholipids...|$|E
40|$|Pig meat {{production}} in New Zealand {{has traditionally been}} associated with the dairy industry, relying upon dairy by-products (principally skim-milk and whey) as major sources of protein and energy for pig feed. However, export market prospects for milk protein led to the diversification of dairy factory products, such as the ultra-filtration of whey protein and lactose extraction of whey. The prevailing economic climate also encouraged dairy farmers to change to whole milk,anker collection and large numbers of the supplementary pig enterprises were closed down. Despite fluctuations, market prices generally showed an increase and many farmers began investigating alternative food supplies in order to take advantage of these higher prices. Garbage and other edible waste provided only limited scope for expansion, and the main alternative appeared to be the use of cereal grains. The New Zealand pig industry, in the last 5 - 10 years, has therefore begun to move towards a specialised form of production based upon the use of diets containing a predominance of cereals, similar to what has prevailed in many overseas countries for a longer period. The local report of Kingma and Ryan (1971) illustrates the need for efficiency in the high cost system of production based upon meal feeding. Where skimmilk is the principal ingredient in the ration, the supply of dietary protein is generally adequate due to the high nutritive value of the protein in this feedstuff. However, when the major source of nutrients comes from cereal grains, although these provide a concentrated source of energy, the poor balance of amino acids becomes limiting to the utilization of such rations. In New Zealand there is a restricted range of feeds high in protein and suitable for incorporation into pig rations. They include skimmilk powder, <b>buttermilk</b> <b>powder,</b> meat meal, meat and bone meal, liver meal and fish meal.

SFE with ethanol as a co-solvent yielded a purified lipid extract with enriched PLs level of 56. 24 ± 0. 07 % on a dry matter basis. Industrial relevance: PLs have many associated health and nutritional benefits including those related to cognitive development and repair. Generation of an ingredient enriched in dairy PLs would be advantageous from an industrial view to allow fortification of nutritionals, both infant and geriatric, in promoting brain health. The present work demonstrates a novel pilot scale process for the generation of a PL enriched ingredient from a BMP substrate. Utilising a combined process of targeted protein hydrolysis followed by selective removal by ultrafiltration of the smaller molecular weight peptide material, an ingredient with 8. 5 fold increase in PL material was achieved. SFE technology was utilised to generate a purified lipid extract with greater PL levels for future applications in biological assays to determine these pathways. The need for investigate and further develop the knowledge relating to the modes of action of these bioactive compounds would be beneficial from a nutritional perspective...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to evaluate {{the usefulness of the}} Tetrahymena assay for predicting the available amino acid content of feeds for pigs. In collaborative studies the Tetrahymena lysine values were also compared with values from the Silcock technique for a series of feeds and attempts were made to evaluate which technique was more applicable to pigs. The pig experiments {{were conducted}} with pigs fed individually once daily during the 20 to 45 kg growth phase. Pig response was assessed in terms of live-weight gain, feed conversion efficiency and carcass lean as estimated by joint dissections. 1) The 4 -day incubation period for the assay of proteins by Tetrahymena as recommended by Stott and. Smith (1966) was found to be adequate for <b>buttermilk</b> <b>powder</b> but not for fish meal or meat and bone meal. By extending the incubation of the latter two meals to 7 days, complete hydrolysis was achieved. Experiments with pigs fed diets formulated with values from either the 4 -day or the 7. -day incubation periods for fish meal and meat and bone meal indicated that values obtained with the Tetrahymena assay after complete hydrolysis of the meals were more applicable to pigs than were those estimated after 4 -days. 2) For cereals a 10 -day incubation period for estimates of lysine and tryptophan with Tetrahymena was found necessary for maximum hydrolysis, and there was good agreement between these values and the response in pigs. 3) There was close agreement between Tetrahymena and Silcock estimates for lysine in samples of soyabean meal that were autoclaved for varying times. In a pig experiment the additions of lysine, methionine and tryptophan to diets containing the autoclaved soyabean meal restored only 43 % {{of the effects of the}} heat damage. 4) This raised the question as to whether the supplements of free amino acids had been efficiently utilised by the pigs. A pig experiment was conducted to examine the effect of feeding a ration containing free lysine either once daily or in six equal portions at three hourly intervals. The results indicated that only 43 % of the free lysine was utilised with once daily feeding relative to the frequent feeding regime. Thus the inability of the amino acids added to the autoclaved soyabean meal to compensate for the effects of heat damage may have been due to inefficient utilisation of the added amino ' acids by the pigs and not to inapplicability of the estimates of heat damage. 5) The amount of protein used in the Tetrahymena assay was found to govern the subsequent hydrolysis of the protein. Attempts to promote more vigourous hydrolysis of small amounts of protein by increasing the amount of inoculum were unsuccessful. Vigourous hydrolysis of the protein was obtained by the addition of 0. 25 mg L-lysine-HC 1 to each assay; this stimulated the initial growth of Tetrahymena, then vigourous hydrolysis resulted. 6) The rate of release of lysine from protein concentrates by Tetrahymena varied. <b>Buttermilk</b> <b>powder</b> and skim milk powder required 2 days, peanut meal 3 days, soyabean meal 4 days, safflower meal 5 days, rapeseed meal 6 days and fishmeal and meat meal 7 to 8 days. Free lysine was utilised within 4 days. 7) The Tetrahymena and Silcock lysine values for different protein concentrates showed no consistent pattern. For soyabean meal the Tetrahymena lysine values were greater than the Silcock values, for peanut meal the estimates were similar, and for the other proteins the Tetrahymena values were lower than the Silcock values. This was particularly so for a meat meal and rapeseed meal where the Tetrahymena values were approximately half the Silcock estimates. 8) An attempt was made to supplement cereal-based diets with protein-bound lysine to achieve diets of similar lysine content; both the Tetrahymena and the Silcock values were used to compute the amount of supplementary protein needed. Diets formulated according to these two values were then fed to pigs in an attempt to decide which value was the better indicator of lysine availability to pigs. This experiment proved inconclusive as factors other than lysine appeared to have influenced the results. This aspect of the comparison of the two methods of assay needs to be examined using feeding trials on a larger scale to eliminate these complicating factors. 9) In Appendix 1, the modifications made to the Tetrahymena assay to allow complete hydrolysis of proteins are Outlined.

40|$|Master of ScienceFood Science InstituteJayendra K. AmamcharlaIn recent years, the {{interest}} in functional components such as phospholipids (PLs) is increasing {{as a result of}} growing awareness of their health benefits. PLs affect several cell functions, such as growth, molecular transport system, memory processing, stress responses, and central nervous system myelination. Many {{studies have shown that the}} neutral lipids can be successfully extracted using supercritical carbon dioxide (SCO₂) from different types of foods such as egg, canola, pumpkin seed, fish and dairy powders. It is an alternative method to avoid the use of large quantities organic solvents. The SCO₂ is a safe, environmentally friendly and economical process to extract edible lipids from a variety of matrices. However, a modifier such as ethanol is needed to fractionate PLs due to limited solubility of PLs in SCO₂. The objectives of this study were to optimize the SFE process parameters and to determine the effect of pressure, temperature, and ethanol concentration on the extraction efficiency of PLs from whey protein phospholipid concentrate (WPPC) and <b>buttermilk</b> <b>powder</b> (BMP). Three different batches of WPPC and BMP were obtained from a commercial manufacturer and followed a unique two-step extraction process to isolate PLs from WPPC and BMP. In Step- 1, neat supercritical CO₂ was used to remove all the neutral lipids at 414 bar pressure, 60 °C sample temperature, and 5 L/min CO₂ flow rate. The spent solids, the powder left after the first step extraction, were used to extract PLs in the second step. The Step- 2 (SCO₂-Ethanol) process was optimized in terms of pressure (350, 414 and 550 bar), temperature (40 °C and 60 °C) and concentration of ethanol (10 %, 15 % and 20 %) as independent factors. All the lipid fractions were analyzed by high performance lipid chromatography (HPLC) and thin layer chromatography (TLC). For WPPC, only ethanol concentration had significant effect (P < 0. 05) on the amount of PLs extracted after the Step- 2. On the other hand, temperature and ethanol concentration were significantly (P < 0. 05) affected the efficiency of SFE for BMP. The optimal processing conditions for WPPC and BMP were 350 bar pressure, 60 °C sample temperature and 15 % concentration of ethanol, and 550 bar of pressure, 60 °C sample temperature and 15 % concentration of ethanol, respectively. This study allowed obtaining PLs from dairy co-products such as WPPC and BMP as a separate ingredient and this could be useful in nutraceutical and infant formulations as well as different food products formulations...|$|E
40|$|Probiotic {{bacteria}} are increasingly prevalent {{in food and}} nutritional products today. These remarkable microorganisms are capable of imparting exceptional health benefits on their host, including prevention of infection by pathogens and stimulation of immune system function. Their most common mode of delivery is through dairy products (e. g. yogurt), which are also one of their preferred habitats. The interactions between probiotic bacteria and dairy systems have been studied, but are still not well discerned. There {{is a need for}} better understanding of these associations, as well as those surrounding the mode of bacterial transfer from the food product to the human gastrointestinal tract. Discoveries into the optimal means of probiotic transport to the body may lead to great advancements in both the design of probiotic foods and their exploitation in the support of human health. Much of the previous research on probiotic bacteria has explored their possible means of adherence in the intestine, as well their strengths in the promotion of human health. Studies relating to their interaction with dairy products are lacking, however, thus this work aims to elucidate some of these aspects. The primary endeavor of this thesis was to develop a technique to quantify the binding affinity of probiotic lactic acid bacteria for milk phospholipids. An additional objective was to exploit these bacteria, as well as dairy ingredients rich in bioactive molecules, {{in the creation of a}} highly nutritious food product. In these experiments, a collection of methods were used in progression in order to arrive at a novel protocol to assess binding with excellent reproducibility and simplicity. These included various membrane blotting techniques, as well as thin-layer chromatography. Essentially, phospholipids from both animal-derived standards and milk extracts were applied to a surface (e. g. PVDF membrane), and bacteria were incubated with them to allow binding reactions. The lactic acid bacteria selected for the final assays consisted of four strains of Lactobacillus, including L. reuteri (SD 2112 and T- 1), L. acidophilus, and L. casei (LC- 10). Their adhesion to phospholipids was detected by either colorimetric or fluorescent labeling systems. To illustrate this, the final method developed was a procedure in which bacteria fluorescently stained with acridine orange were allowed to bind to dots of PVDF membrane coated with phospholipids. The results of this study showed that lactic acid bacteria undeniably exhibit selective binding affinity for phospholipids as opposed to other lipids such as triglycerides. The bacteria demonstrated significantly greater binding for a phospholipid extract from milk as opposed to individual phospholipid standards from other sources (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Nonetheless, adhesion to all phospholipids was substantially greater than that to triglycerides. These findings, as well as the development of this method, should prove valuable in future research regarding the associations of probiotics with dairy systems. An additional purpose of this thesis was to design a dairy-based food product containing ingredient sources rich in milk bioactives. A gel-type product was created using primarily colostrum, <b>buttermilk</b> <b>powder,</b> and whey protein isolate, as well as selected strains of Lactobacillus. With the inclusion of immunoglobulin-rich colostrum, the product was analyzed alongside fluid milk and colostrum in order to quantify and compare these bioactive molecules. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to complete this, and the results revealed concentrations that would be expected by the literature. Specifically, immunoglobulin G (IgG) was quantified by interpolation from a bovine IgG standard regression curve. The results showed that the concentration of IgG in the gel was nearly twice that of colostrum, and almost eight-fold higher than that of milk. This indicates that use of bioactive-rich substances, such as colostrum, in a food product may serve as a means of delivering more concentrated doses of bioactives than their respective ingredients. The research completed in this thesis is significant in that it contributes a valuable method to the elucidation of bacterial binding interactions with milk components, and also demonstrates the successful application of dairy ingredients to an innovative food product high in beneficial compounds. The insight provided by these studies could encourage further work in improving the understanding of probiotic delivery and advancing the development of bioactive-rich food products...|$|E
