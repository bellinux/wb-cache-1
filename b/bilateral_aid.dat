40|$|OBJECTIVE: Analyse the {{difference}} in school careers and secondary school qualification levels between unilateral hearing <b>aid</b> users and <b>bilateral</b> hearing <b>aid</b> users. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective questionnaire study. SETTING: Postal-based questionnaire. PARTICIPANTS: Names of adults {{known to have been}} fitted with unilateral or <b>bilateral</b> hearing <b>aids</b> during childhood were retrieved. This resulted in 292 names. Participants were selected using the following criteria: availability of the medical record, presence of bilateral hearing loss, completed secondary school education, normal IQ and a minimum aided word-recognition score of 70 % at 10 years of age. The questionnaire was sent to 50 potential participants of whom 40 responded, resulting in two groups comprising 19 unilateral and 21 <b>bilateral</b> hearing <b>aid</b> users. METHODS: A questionnaire was developed to obtain data on secondary school levels and aspects of the school careers, such as type of schools attended (mainstream versus special), repeating a school year and additional assistance (speech and language therapy, personal frequency modulation systems). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Comparison of the benefit of <b>bilateral</b> hearing <b>aid</b> fitting versus unilateral hearing aid fitting on secondary school qualification level, type of school the children attended, class failure and additional assistance used. RESULTS: The group of bilaterally fitted hearing aid users eventually completed secondary school at a superior level than the unilaterally fitted users. 33 % of binaural hearing aid users achieved qualifications giving access to a bachelors degree compared with 21 % of unilateral users. There were no differences between those fitted with unilateral and <b>bilateral</b> hearing <b>aids</b> in the type of schools attended, repeating a school year and additional assistance. CONCLUSIONS: The <b>bilateral</b> hearing <b>aid</b> users obtained superior secondary school qualifications than the unilateral users but their school careers were comparable...|$|R

40|$|The most logical {{solution}} if {{a person}} has a hearing impairment on both ears, seems to be <b>bilateral</b> bearing <b>aid</b> amplification in both ears. Numerous studies have shown the advantages of this fitting strategy. However, there were always some individuals not benefiting from bilateral hearing aids; until recently a neglected group of persons. The {{first part of the}} present work examines patterns of usage of <b>bilateral</b> hearing <b>aids</b> and situations where the users benefit most from <b>bilateral</b> hearing <b>aids.</b> Measurements of speech recognition in noise and localization with two, one and no bearing aids were performed. The second part of this work concentrates on persons rejecting <b>bilateral</b> bearing <b>aids</b> because of unspecified reasons, not related to practical or technical issues. Paper I describes an enquiry-based, retrospective study with questions on experienced advantages and disadvantages of <b>bilateral</b> hearing <b>aids</b> as well as the pattern in which the hearing aids were used. A majority of the 144 persons participating in the survey used <b>bilateral</b> bearing <b>aids.</b> Two hearing aids were mainly appreciated in complex listening situations with high demands on speech recognition. Improved sound quality {{was one of the reasons}} to use two rather than one hearing aid. The users of two bearing aids described better localization abilities than users of one hearing aid. lit the second study, paper II, 19 bilaterally hearing-impaired persons, provided with two hearing aids, participated in psychoacoustical measurements of speech recognition in noise and localization. Both measurements showed an advantage for <b>bilateral</b> hearing <b>aids.</b> Localization could not be improved beyond the score, that the participants reached without hearing aids, but the level of localization could at least he retained with two hearing aids whereas it deteriorated with a unilateral bearing aid. In the study described in paper III, methods to measure individual auditory performance with focus on binaural aspects of the auditory system were put together. An evaluation with normal-hearing subjects showed significantly different results for measurements of speech recognition in noise and signal analysis abilities under monaural and binaural listening conditions. A measurement of central auditory and cognitive function also was included in this evaluation. The final step of this work, paper IV, was the application of the methods developed in paper III on two groups of hearing- impaired persons, one group appreciating <b>bilateral</b> hearing <b>aids,</b> one group rejecting them and using unilateral amplification instead. The study had a diagnostic approach with all measurements performed unaided. Significant differences between the two groups were found in central auditory performance and cognition with an advantage for the group benefiting from <b>bilateral</b> hearing <b>aids.</b> To a less degree, also peripheral hearing might be degraded in the group preferring one bearing aid and they also might have been provided with too much amplification in their hearing aids. The binaural performance was about the same in both groups. This work has shown, in which situations it is advantageous to use <b>bilateral</b> bearing <b>aids.</b> Tests have been identified to provide better understanding and diagnostic possibilities for hearing-impaired persons, who are not able to benefit from bilateral amplification...|$|R

Through he always denied it in public, but Kishi saw the ADF as an economic version of the [...] "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" [...] that Japan had sought to establish in World War II, which contributed to the failure of the proposed ADF as memories of the Japanese occupation were too fresh in Southeast Asia. To many people in Southeast Asia, the slogan [...] "Economic Development for Asia by Asia" [...] sounded too much like the wartime Japanese slogan [...] "Asia for Asians!". During World War II, the Japanese state had always presented the war as a race war between Asians vs. the [...] "white devils", portraying the war as a Pan-Asian crusade to unite all of the peoples of Asia against the [...] "white devils". The Japanese had been generally welcomed as liberators from European imperialism when they arrived in Southeast Asia, but soon the peoples of Southeast Asia had learned the Japanese did not regard other Asians as equals, as the Japanese had a habit of slapping the faces of the peoples they ruled to remind them who were the [...] "Great Yamato race" [...] and who were not. [...] The Burmese Prime Minister U Nu had, like everyone else in the Burmese elite, been a Japanese collaborator in World War II. Precisely because of his past U Nu told Kishi during his visit to Rangoon that he was reluctant to join the ADF as it would remind the Burmese people of the days when he was shouting Pan-Asian rhetoric, praising Japan as the natural leader of Asia and declaring how happy he was to serve the Japanese. Even in countries that were not occupied by Japan like India, Ceylon and Pakistan, Kishi encountered obstacles. During his visit to Karachi, the Pakistani Prime Minister Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy told Kishi that he thought of himself as a [...] "human being rather than an Asian first", preferred bilateral over multilateral aid as it allowed Pakistan to play off rival nations for better terms, and that Pakistan would not join the ADF if India also joined. Suhrawadry made it clear that until the Kashmir dispute was settled to Pakistan's satisfaction that Pakistan would not be joining any organization that India was a member of. [...] The Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru told Kishi during his visit to New Delhi that he wanted his nation to be neutral in the Cold War, and that as Japan was allied to the United States, joining the ADF would be in effect aligning India with the Americans. In Colombo, the Ceylonese Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike, through not objecting to the ADF in principle, told Kishi that he preferred <b>bilateral</b> <b>aid</b> deals as it allowed Ceylon to play off the Soviet Union against the United States, and objected to the provision that joining the ADF would mean be [...] "locked in" [...] to only accepting aid from the ADF. Only during his visit to Taiping did Kishi receive outright acceptance of the ADF, through the Taiwanese press statement proclaiming the ADF would be most useful for stopping the rise of Communism in Asia proved embarrassing for Kishi as he had maintained in public that the ADF was supposed to be an organization for allowing Asians to help other Asians and had nothing to do with the Cold War. Because Japan was a much richer nation than all of the other nations of the proposed ADF combined, the ADF was generally as a vehicle for Japan to re-establish itself as a great power in Asia, as few had any doubt that Japan would be the dominant member of the ADF. Moreover, the fact that the United States was supporting the ADF led the proposed organization to be seen as siding with the United States in the Cold War, a struggle that many Asian nations wanted to be neutral in.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the evolution and pros and cons of bilateral amplification. Determining whether a <b>bilateral</b> hearing <b>aid</b> fitting is superior to that of a monaural hearing aid is a long-standing question; for this reason, the trend toward bilateral amplification has been slow. However, it is now assumed that bilateral amplification has significant advantages over monaural amplification in most cases, a view that is supported by our localization results. In this article, we will address the advantages of <b>bilateral</b> hearing <b>aids</b> and reveal some new localization data that show that most listeners with bilateral amplification, when tested unaided, as well as normal-hearing listeners manifested very high degrees of symmetry in their judgments of perceived angle while listeners who rou-tinely use monaural amplification and those with asymmetric hearing loss had relatively large asymmetries. These data show that asymmetry in localization judgments is a much more sen-sitive indicator of abnormal localization ability than the magni-tude of localization errors.

40|$|Objectives: Sequential and {{simultaneous}} bilateral cochlear implants {{are emerging}} as appropriate treatment options for Australian adults with sensory deficits in both cochleae. Current funding of Australian public hospitals {{does not provide}} for simultaneous bilateral cochlear implantation (CI) as a separate surgical procedure. Previous cost-effectiveness studies of sequential and simultaneous bilateral CI assumed 100 % of unilaterally treated patients' transition to a sequential bilateral CI. This assumption does not place cochlear implantation {{in the context of}} the generally treated population. When mutually exclusive treatment options exist, such as unilateral CI, sequential bilateral CI, and simultaneous bilateral CI, the mean costs of the treated populations are weighted in the calculation of incremental cost-utility ratios. The objective was to evaluate the cost-utility of <b>bilateral</b> hearing <b>aids</b> (HAs) compared with unilateral, sequential, and simultaneous bilateral CI in Australian adults with bilateral severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss. Research Design: Cost-utility analysis of secondary sources input to a Markov model. Setting: Australian health care perspective, lifetime horizon with costs and outcomes discounted 5 % annually. Intervention: Bilateral HAs as treatment for bilateral severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss compared with unilateral, sequential, and simultaneous bilateral CI. Main Outcome Measures: Incremental costs per quality adjusted life year (AUD/QALY). Results: When compared with <b>bilateral</b> hearing <b>aids</b> the incremental cost-utility ratio for the CI treatment population was AUD 11, 160 /QALY. The incremental cost-utility ratio was weighted according to the number of patients treated unilaterally, sequentially, and simultaneously, as these were mutually exclusive treatment options. Conclusion: No peer-reviewed articles have reported the incremental analysis of cochlear implantation in a continuum of care for surgically treated populations with bilateral severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss. Unilateral, sequential, and simultaneous bilateral CI were cost-effective when compared with <b>bilateral</b> hearing <b>aids.</b> Technologies that reduce the total number of visits for a patient could introduce additional cost efficiencies into clinical practice...|$|R

Although a lot of studies have been done on normal hearing and hearing impaired persons, little research has been done on directional hearing in <b>bilateral</b> hearing <b>aid</b> users. A person with <b>bilateral</b> hearing <b>aids</b> is wearing two independent digital signal processors with microphones often placed on behind the ear devices. Each device introduces a certain delay and has its own compression curve and noise reduction strategies. This could mean that the interaural cues (interaural level and timing differences) are not in agreement with the actual auditory scene. This can degrade binaural processing capabilities for hearing aid users. This study examined binaural capabilities in the frontal horizontal hemisphere of hearing impaired, <b>bilateral</b> hearing <b>aid</b> users. Localization and speech recognition in noise were studied. Localization tests were carried out using low frequency, high frequency and broadband signals, with and without hearing aids, omnidirectional configurations as well as adaptive directional microphone configurations were used. Results show that a) hearing aid users localize worse than normal hearing persons and a much larger standard deviation is noticed in this group, b) Most hearing aid persons score better without (with a louder stimulus) then with their hearing aids, c) without hearing aids, localization was worse than the normal hearing group, d) persons wearing hearing aids subjectively preferred their own ears for localization instead of their hearing aids, e) low frequency noise bands were localized more accurately then high frequency noise bands, and broadband signals were localized best, this in agreement with normal hearing persons, f) adding jammer noise sources degraded localization, with hearing aids this degradation was worse then without. status: publishe...|$|R
