50|$|The deep-water coral {{systems on}} the mounds are {{especially}} fragile. Unlike shallow-water coral reefs, {{they are not}} adapted to cope with minor disturbances such as wave action. The mounds also support significant populations of the xenophyophore Syringammina fragilissima. This is a giant single-celled organism (a protozoan) that is widespread in deep waters, but occurs in particularly high densities on the mounds and the tails. Individual xenophyophores can grow to be larger than 20 cm and are often very fragile. The corals themselves provide a habitat for a wide diversity of other marine life including sponges, worms, crustaceans and molluscs. Among these starfish, sea urchins and crabs. Various fish have been observed, including <b>blue</b> <b>ling,</b> roundnose grenadier, and the orange roughy.|$|E
40|$|Fishery catch data offer a rich {{potential}} source of information for management, if modelling can separate out the effects of fishing effort, species behaviour and population abundance. Here we model catch data from the <b>blue</b> <b>ling</b> fishery off the northwest coast of Scotland, using Generalized Additive Mixed Models with a space time interaction represented via a novel tensor product of a soap film smooth of space with a penalized regression spline of time. The use of soap film smoothers avoids imposing correspondences between spatially adjacent areas that are in fact separated by the stock boundary. The comparison {{of the performance of}} the soap film smooth for space-time with that of a thin plate regression spline (TPRS) based on root mean squared prediction errors and k-means cross-validation suggests that in this application the former is better overall and in particular for modelling local changes. Further, a model with continuous space-year interaction performed better compared to one with an additive space-year effect. After model selection, checking and validation there is evidence for increasing <b>blue</b> <b>ling</b> abundance from 2000 - 2010 in some spatial locations...|$|E

40|$|The {{possibilities}} of the refractive index (RI) of the eye fluid as a freshness test for fish were investigated. Procedure details were studied {{in order to improve}} the usefulness of the method. The following fishes were used : cod (Gadus morhua L), plaice (Pleuronectes platessa L), redfish (Sebastes marinus L) and <b>blue</b> <b>ling</b> (Molva byrkelange). It appears necessary to extract nearly the whole quantity of eye fluid. Checking the RI of left and right eye can be omitted. Centrifuging the eye fluid is not absolutely required but improves readability. Filtration has no practical value. Keeping the eye fluid during 24 hrs at I ° C results only in a very slight increase in RI : if necessary, determinations can be postponed without harm. The temperature of the refractometer must be maintained at 20 ° C ± 1, 5 o C. At fairly constant room temperature, no thermostat is required for routine analyses. A handrefractometer appears to be of little use. With redfish and <b>blue</b> <b>ling,</b> no satisfactory results are obtained. Spoilage curves of cod and plaice on the other hand agree fairly well with organoleptic judgment. The RI seems to be a useful freshness test with those species. Quality gradings are proposed. Advantages and limitations of the method were investigated. The RI can be determined very quickly with simple apparatus and by non specialised personnel. However, no determination is possible on beheaded of proccssed fish or on fish with very small eyes. As variations among individuals can be large, a sufficient number of fishes should always be taken for analysis...|$|E
40|$|The {{longline}} fisheries for ling (Molva molva) and tusk (Brosme brosme) {{have long}} traditions in Norway. <b>Blue</b> <b>ling</b> (Molva dipterygia) {{was always a}} by-catch in Norwegian slope waters but about 15 years ago this species became {{the target of a}} deep-water gill-net fishery. In recent years 5 - 10 % of the firsthand value of Norwegian landings was attributed to these species. This report provides an overview of the fisheries and population biology of the three species, with emphasis on aspects of relevance to future stock assessments, based on results from Norwegian investigations in 1993 - 95 and literature reviews. The Norwegian fleets which target ling, tusk and <b>blue</b> <b>ling</b> are the high-seas autoline vessels which operate in waters to the west and north of the British Isles, in the North Sea and at the Faroes and Iceland, and longline and gill-net vessels of various sizes fishing in home waters along the Norwegian slope. Exploitation occurs {{in all parts of the}} distribution area of the species. It is still unclear whether separate stocks occur in different sub-areas. Spawning areas are wide-spread, also the distribution of eggs and larvae. Very little is known about migrations. The age and size structure of the catches in various fishing areas show only minor variation. New studies by electrophoresis of tissue enzymes and hemoglobins indicate that tusk from all areas sampled in the northeastern Atlantic belong to the same gene pool, where the results for ling and <b>blue</b> <b>ling</b> are inconclusive. Estimates of mortality show that exploitation rates are high, and catch per unit of effort (CPUE) analyses of ling and tusk based on both private and official logbooks from the longliners indicate a considerable decline in the population sizes since the 1970 s. The catch per unit of effort may have declined by about 70 %. Strategies and requirements for future monitoring by improved CPUE measures and age-based assessement models are discussed. NORSK SAMMENDRAG:Linefisket etter lange og brosme har lange tradisjoner i Norge.

40|$|Investigations on gonatus fabricii (gonatus) in the Norwegian Sea {{and western}} Barents Sea {{continued}} during June-September 1982 and 1983. Materials were collected with pelagic trawls and from stomach contents of <b>blue</b> <b>ling</b> and Greenland halibut. Dorsal mantle lengths (DML) were mainly 20 - 50 mm, extremes 10 mm and 100 mm. Larger gonatus, DML 80 - 200 mm, {{were taken in}} deep pelagic and bottom hauls at 200 - 400 m. Gonatus with DML 95 - 255 mm were the main contents in stomachs of <b>blue</b> <b>ling</b> and Greenland halibut fished in April-June on the continental slope off western Norway. Age and growth were estimated from counts of primary growth rings in the statoliths. In the juveniles, linear relations were found between DML and number of growth rings, but with varying slopes of the regression lines, and correlation coefficients, r, varying from 0. 47 to 0. 67. In larger gonatus, the regression curve had a sigmoid shape. The assumption that larger gonatus, having. left the surface layers, grow considerably faster than the juveniles, seems to be confirmed. The relationship between total statolith length. (TLS) and DML, both in mm, was calculated for various length groups with the following results: DML 10 - 250 mm: TLS = 0. 131 DML 0. 47, n = 201, r²= 0. 93 DML 10 - 69 mm: TLS = 0. 104 DML 0. 53, n = 163, r²= 0. 93 DML 70 - 250 mm: TLS = 0. 328 DML 0. 26, n = 38, r²= 0. 74 There is a considerable change in the relationship for DML longer than 70 mm, indicating a slower growth of the stato 1 iths. The main spawning period seems to be from December to April, on, or near the bottom in 300 - 700 m depth or more on the continental slopes of the Norwegian Sea, from {{the west coast of}} Norway to West-Spitsbergen, and westwards to Iceland and Jan Mayen. The food of juvenile gonatus was dominated by amphipods, Parathemisto sp., but copepods, chaetognaths, euphausiids, pteropods and Pasiphaea sp. were also identified.

This is a multi-species fishery, carried out by stern bottom trawlers, mainly between June and September, in depths mainly between 800 m to 1600 m. The importance of the fishing activity {{in this area is}} increasing notably. This fishery has been monitored since the beginning in 1996, with the collaboration of the fishing industry, by means of a scientific observer programme. The observers on board provide data on catches, discards, location and depth, haul by haul. Length samples of the main species and biological material are also collected. The species composition of the catches is presented. In terms of weight, the roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris) and the bairdii smoothhead (Alepocephalus bairdi i) are the most important species in the catches. Other less important species are the Portuguese dogfish (Centroscymnus coelolepis) and the <b>blue</b> <b>ling</b> (Molva dypterygia). In addition to the total catch, the composition of the retained catch and the discard are studied.

40|$|The {{stocks of}} ling Molva molva L., <b>blue</b> <b>ling</b> Molva dipterygia (Pennant, 1784) and tusk Brosme brosme L. {{in the northeastern}} Atlantic support {{significant}} coastal and offshore bank and slope fisheries in several countries. In 1992, Iceland, the Faroes and Norway initiated a three-year project which should provide improved knowledge of the biology of the three species (Bergstad and Hareide 1996; Magnusson et al. 1997). In that project it was focused specifically on age determination methods which could form a basis for future stock assessments and further studies of biology. For all the three species {{there was a need}} for reconsidering the ageing methods applied in earlier studies, and on that basis, perform further technical development and inter-calibration of age readings. This manual summarises results of efforts made for two of the species, ling and tusk, in the period 1993 - 1996. The manual illustrates the agreed practices which should provide reasonably precise age estimates. Data from several inter-calibration exercises carried out during the nordic project were presented by Bergstad et al. (1997). The only structure useful for determining the age of ling and tusk are the sagittal otoliths, and the otoliths are extracted by the same procedures as used for other gadoids (e. g. Williams and Bedford 1974). This manual aims at assisting age readers who are inexperienced with the reading of ling and tusk otoliths. It should be used as an initial guideline and reference only. In order to achieve precise and stable age determination, {{there is a need for}} inter-calibrations of readings by different readers, and repeated reading by the same reader...|$|E
40|$|By far the {{majority}} of the investigated Gonatus fabricii were caught as bycatch by pelagic trawls fishing in the upper 60 m. Sampling took place in April/May, June/July and August/September in the period 1978 - 1991. The distribution of gonatus along the Norwegian coast south of 71 °N is clearly connected with Atlantic water with salinities above 35 ‰. The highest concentrations are found in the area between Jan Mayen and Spitsbergen, i. e. in the Polar front area. The biomass of young gonatus in the Norwegian Sea constituted at least 1, 5 mill tonnes in July 1994. Young gonatus begin to occur in the surface layers in May, and they seem to descend from the upper 60 m at a length of 50 - 60 mm. They might then live near the bottom or pelagically at depths of 200 - 600 m. Age and growth based on counts of primary growth rings should be treated with caution. At least in the eastem part of the Norwegian Sea prey items for gonatus are, in decreasing order of impoerance, amphipods, mainly Parathemisto spp., copepods, chaetognaths and euphausiids. Larger gonatus consume fry of Sebastes sp., Maurolicus miilleri, and small gonatus. Based on catch statistics are four spawning areas for gonatus suggested: West of Spitsbergen, off Vesterålen, off Møre and between Iceland and Jan Mayen. Hatching seems to take place throughout the year while the main spawning takes place from December to April. The growth rate of the statoliths decreases strongly in gonatus with DML 70 - 250 mm. The correlation between the rostral length of the gonatus beak and dorsal mantle length was calculated. Gonatus are important as food for the bottlenose whale.

40|$|Two {{surveys were}} carried out in 1995 {{as part of the}} {{continuing}} deep water fish research programme at the Fisheries Research Centre. The trawl survey fished areas on the eastern slopes of the Rockall Trough and on two seamounts of the mid-Atlantic ridge approximately 300 miles north of the Azores. The deep water longline trip was the first such survey carried out by the Fisheries Research Centre and concentrated on previously fished grounds in the Rockall Trough and on new areas along the slope of the Porcupine Bank. Both surveys {{were carried out}} in conjunction with an Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) and the objective was to locate commercial quantities of deep water fish and to obtain samples for biological analyses. The trawl survey was conducted on a chartered fishing vessel using a commercial otter trawl, fitted with a small mesh cod-end liner. Twenty-six trawling operations were carried out in the depth range 750 m- 1, 400 m, of which 21 produced fish catches. Longlines were set between 542 m and 1, 521 m and only one line was lost. Thirteen chondricthian and 38 species of teleost fish were recorded from the catches. The most abundant species in the catches were Portuguese shark, roundnose grenadier, black scabbard, Baird's smoothhead, <b>blue</b> <b>ling</b> and orange roughy. Length, weight, sex, maturity and catch data together with samples of otoliths and gonads were collected. Discards were monitored from both fishing methods. In comparison with the trawl, longline catches produced larger specimens of fewer species which were more dominated by sharks. Overall catch rates for the longlines were similar to Norwegian data for the Rockall area. Trawl catch rates showed a decrease since the last Irish survey in this area in 1993...|$|E

The excep-tion from this schedule is stocks from Va (Iceland) that have advice annually. Availa-ble time-series for international landings and discards, fishing effort, survey indices and biological information were updated and for all stocks and are presented in Sec-tions 4 to 14 of the report. Significant discrepancies found in previous years for some fisheries between official landings data supplied to ICES and scientific estimates of landings were lesser for 2014 landings. In order to maintain the consistency of time-series (which previously used only scientific estimates), some landings have been included in the data tables as “unallocated landing” (see Section 2. 2). The assessment of ling in VA using GADGET, developed as exploratory assessment in recent years, is now benchmark as a fully analytical model. The spawning stock of ling in Va is estimated to have reached in 2013 a highest observed level in 30 years, three times above the 1982 – 2002 average. The state of other ling stocks is diverse and overall less favourable. <b>Blue</b> <b>ling</b> stocks also showed different status amongst stock units with strong varia-tions in catch, recruitment and biomass in Va, a sustained increased in biomass in relation to a decrease fishing mortality in Vb, VI and VII, and a persistent low level in other areas. The updated assessment for areas Vb, VI and VII suggested that the stock has recovered to BMSY level and the exploitation rate in 2014 was well below FMSY. There is no directed fishery for <b>blue</b> <b>ling</b> in other areas. The landings are now only bycatches. All Subareas within the assessment unit other areas show a declining trend in landings and the stock seems to be depleted in ICES Subarea II. Assessment of tusk was carried out as described in the stock annex, the main pro-gress being made is the standardization of cpue series for many of the stock units and a new estimate of FMSY for tusk in Va. Estimates of biomass for tusk in Va from the GADGET model were revised downward the main reason being a significant drop in the tuning series in 2014 (Icelandic March survey). Until 2014, ICES advised on two stock units of greater silver smelt, in Va and other areas. Following proposal form the group to split the other areas GSS into three advi-sory units; Area I and II, Vb and VIa and finally other areas, assessment were carried out and advice will be delivered for these three units. In areas I and II, data from Norwegian fisheries do not show any negative trends in recent years. Larger and older fish are caught from Norwegian surveys than from the fisheries in the same area. Acoustic biomass estimates in 2012 show some reduction compared to 2009, but marked upward trend again in 2014. Trawl cpue series show an upward trend since 2004. The advice for greater silver smelt in Vb and VIa is based on trends in cpue (kg/hour) from the Faroese summer survey on the Faroe Plateau, which show a slight decrease in the latest years. In 2014, the Faroese authorities set a law of species-specific management of greater silver smelt for Faroese waters. The TAC in 2014 was 16 000 tons and the TAC for 2015 was 14 400 tons. Six trawlers have licences to direct fishery of greater silver smelt. The regulation also includes limitations in e. g. bycatch, mesh size and fishing area. The EU introduced TAC management in 2003. For 2013 the EU TAC was set to 4316 tons in area V, VI, VII. For 2014 and 2016 the EU TAC was set to the same as in 2013 (V, VI, VII = 4316 tons). Most, if not all, of theEU TAC is caught in ICES Division VIa, therefore from the Vb–VIa stock unit. The fishery is smaller in other areas where the species is also discarded by various fisheries in quantities that could not be estimated. Little new data and no new assessment were presented for orange roughy in 2015. The species appears is very small amount in discards of some fleets in EU waters. There is a Faroese fishery on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. For this particularly long-lived species, the results Productivity Susceptibility Analysis (PSA) presented in 2013 re-main appropriate and do no need yearly updating. The status of the roundnose grenadier stocks are varied. Roundnose grenadier in Vb, VI, VII and XIIb is assessed using a Bayesian surplus production model since 2010. The fishing pressure in recent years is estimated low, the biomass is slowly rebuild-ing after two decades of overexploitation. No advice is required in 2015. Exploratory assessments were carried out using the abundance indices from the Marine Scotland Deepwater Science Survey instead of the usual French tallybook indices (which was also run for comparison between models). Estimated trends in stock biomass using the survey of the tallybook indices are consistent. However, the stock biomass in re-cent years is estimated to increase at a substantially higher rate when the model is fit to the survey index. The survey covers the main distribution range of thee stock and the main fishing grounds. It is therefore most likely to provide a realistic index of the stock abundance. It may further be conservative as it does not cover the fully area of distribution part of which has not been fished in recent years. WGDEEP proposed the stock for benchmarking in 2017, in order to review the use of biomass indices and investigate alternative to the current assessment model. The fishery for roundnose grenadier in Division IIIa has been stopped since 2006 and landings are now insignificant. The bycatch from other fisheries is also low. The only information to assess this stock is now a Norwegian survey index from the same area. This index has shown a declining trend since 2006 and is now at the lowest level rec-orded during the time-series from 1984. The state of roundnose grenadier stocks on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is unclear owing to limited data. This stock was intensively exploited in the 1970 s and 1980 s, the fishery declined in the 1990 s and was insignifi-cant in the 2000 s and resumed in 2011. In other areas, roundnose grenadier is only a bycatch and catch are insignificant. An assessment and advice was requested for the roughhead grenadier (Macrourus berglax) in the Northeast Atlantic owing to landings reported in previous years. Data were compiled and a catch based advice was prepared. This species is caught and subject to TAC management in the NAFO area. In the ICES area, it occurs at a much lower level, it is however known to occur at east Greenland (Division XIVb, Iceland (Va), Faroe Islands (Vb), Northern North Sea (IVa), Norwegian and Barents Sea (I and II). The landings level reported in some previous years were not plausible as high densities are not known to occur in reported catch areas. An advice reflecting possi-ble level of sustainable catch was prepared. Similarly, an assessment and advice was requested for the roundsnout grenadier (Trachyrincus scabrus) in the Northeast Atlantic (see chapter 15). This species is con-sidered to have none or only minor commercial interest. The request for an advice came from landings reported in previous years. These landings were considered to be either minor bycatch or species misreporting. The advice is that the possible small landings of the species are counted against existing roundnose and roughhead gren-adiers TACs. The assessment of black scabbardfish was benchmarked at WKDEEP 2014. This spe-cies was formerly assessed in three units in the ICES area. Although no final conclu-sion is reached all available evidence suggest that a single stock does a large clockwise migrations in the Northeast Atlantic and further south in the CECAF areas where spawning occurs. Whether fish in Azorean waters and on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (ICES Subareas X and XII) belongs to the same widely distributed stock is un-certain and the picture in Subarea X is further blurred by the mixing with the closely related intermediate scabbardfish (Aphanopus intermedius). Greater forkbeard is caught mostly as a bycatch. Adults are a landed bycatch in slope fisheries for hake, monkfish, megrims and deep-water species and juveniles are a discarded bycatch in numerous fisheries. The assessment is based upon indices from four surveys. The increasing trend in abundance and biomass in recent years seems to be reverting. Time-series of survey indices display pluri-annual fluctuations, prob-ably related to recruitment variability. Alfonsinos are a mixture of two species (Beryx splendens and Beryx decadactylus. These species are oceanic demersal species occurring at the top of seamounts and along slopes, where they form local aggregations. They are widespread in the Northeast Atlantic from Iceland to the Azores and along the continental slope, in particular to the west of Iberia and Bay of Biscay. The stock structure is uncertain and data very limited. Although a longline survey is carried out in the Azores, where most of the catch occur, the reliably of survey indices is uncertain for these species owing to their large and patchy spatial distributions. As a consequence, the perception of the status of these stocks relies primarily on catch trends. Three stocks of blackspot sea bream are assessed by WGDEEP. In ICES Subarea IX Target fishery only take places in the Strait of Gibraltar, while the species is taken as a bycatch of artisanal fleets which uses mainly longlines. In 2014, landings and lpue from the Spanish “voracera” target fishery seemed increasing and the mean length in the catchwas slightly larger. However, the VMS-based lpue developed in recent years could not be updated and the assessment this stock is undermined by the lack of data from the Mediterranean and CECAF area as the same stockstraddles over ICES, CE-CAF and GFCM areas, where management regimes are different. Although no advice is given in 2015 for blackspot sea bream stocks, the WGDEEP report reminds that a recovery plan involving all parties is necessary for this stock. The stock of the same species in the Azores (ICES Subarea X) also showed signs of overexploitation. Ex-ploratory analyses of the natural and fishing mortalities were conducted using catch curves in order to investigate optimal exploitation reference points (yield-per-recruit analysis). Results show that modelling the fraction of population that change sex is a key issue to better estimating the trajectory of the spawning biomass. Data collection on sex ratio, maturity and sex change has been updated and analysed. Traditional models should be extended to incorporate the sex change issue. The third blackspot sea bream stock in ICES Subareas VI, VII and VIII remains at a low level, since it col-lapsed in the 1980 s. In response to a request from the NEAFC, the working group update descriptions of deep-water fisheries in the NEAFC and ICES areas by compiling data on catch/landings, fishing effort and known spawning areas and areas of local deple-tionat the finest spatial resolution possible by ICES subarea and division (Chapter 15) ...|$|E
40|$|Capture {{fisheries}} and aquaculture supplied {{the world with}} about 148 million tonnes of fish in 2010, of which about 128 million tonnes were utilized as food for people. The fishery market is becoming much more complex and stratified, with greater diversification among species and product forms {{and for this reason}} food safety remains a major concern facing the seafood industry. Along fish value chain {{there are a lot of}} concern regarding public health and for this reason the aim of this work was to propose an approach to antibiotic resistance and parasites risk assessment in fish production value chains. The main consequences of the use and the abuse of antibiotics is the development and diffusion of antibiotic resistance that become a serious global problem. The aim of this research was to evaluate the presence of antimicrobial residues and to assess the antimicrobial resistance in bacteria species isolated from different wild caught seawater fish and fishery products. Three antibiotic substances (Oxytetracicline, Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim) were detected (by screening and confirmatory methods) in Octopus vulgaris, Sepia officinalis and Thais haemastoma. All Vibrio strains isolated from fish were resistant to Vancomycin and Penicillin. In Vibrio alginolyticus, isolated in Octopus vulgaris, a resistance against 9 antibiotics was noted. Human fishery product-borne parasitic diseases include those caused by cestodes, trematodes and nematodes. These diseases are either caused by an infection following ingestion of viable parasites, or as an allergic (hypersensitivity) reaction against parasite antigens which occurs for nematodes of the family Anisakidae. Parasite risk assessment was evaluated in 3 different steps: •	Different infection indexes in european hakes (Merluccius merluccius) belonging from Atlantic ocean (FAO zone 27 IXa) and from Tyrrhenian sea (FAO zone 37. 1. 2) were assessed identifying and charactering species and populations of parasites. A total of 2990 larval specimens of A. simplex (s. l.) from Merluccius merluccius captured in the two different fishing grounds were collected: 2836 anisakids in hakes from FAO 27 fishing ground and only 154 anisakids in hakes from 37. 1. 2 fishing ground. A. simplex (s. s.) and A. pegreffii co-infected the same individual fish host, in viscera and in the fillets (hypaxial and epaxial) fished from the FAO 27 fishing ground; only A. pegreffii in hakes from FAO area 37. 1. 2 in viscera and in hypaxial flesh was found. •	The presence of nematodes in 33 fish species belonging from different FAO areas using artificial peptic digestion was evaluated and parasites identification using microscopical techniques and RT-PCR was performed. A total of 10897 anisakid larvae were found and collected in the flesh. The <b>blue</b> <b>ling</b> (Molva dypterygia), european conger (Conger conger) and Peter's fish (Zeus faber) were the most highly infected species respectively. A total of 27, 27 % of the species analyzed were anisakid-free; a monitoring tool for the evaluation of parasite infection in fish lots with the aim to assess parasites impact on marketed fish, as EFSA states in a recent report, was applied; 29 % of the evaluated fish lots had a score between 0 - 3, refering to serious weaknesses in the fish lots. •	The survival of Anisakis larvae, naturally present in fish, at different stages of ripening process in traditional salted anchovies was evaluated since a recent EFSA panel on risk assessment of parasites in fishery products stated that research on identification of alternative treatments for killing viable parasites in fishery products are needed. Viability was tested with different methods and the results showed that all larvae were not viable at the 15 th ripening day. The dry salting process at mean salt concentration of 24 % in all parts of the flesh at the end of the ripening period can be considered an effective method for devitalising anisakids larval forms present in the raw material and obtain a safe product for the consumer...|$|E
