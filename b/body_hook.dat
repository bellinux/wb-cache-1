5000|$|Tight First Operation Seam - Tight first {{operation}} seams {{can create}} flatness {{at the bottom}} of the first operation seam throughout its length. The cover hook may also be turned into the <b>body</b> <b>hook.</b> Overly tight first operation seams tend to create more reverse wrinkles in the cover hook.|$|E
5000|$|Cover Vee - [...] "Vees" [...] or [...] "lips" [...] are {{projections}} of the double seam below {{the bottom of a}} normal seam that resemble a [...] "V" [...] shape. There is usually no overlap of the cover hook with the <b>body</b> <b>hook</b> and these defects usually occur in small areas of the seam.|$|E
50|$|Probably {{the most}} {{important}} innovation since the introduction of double seams is the welded side seam. Prior to the welded side seam, the can body was folded and/or soldered together, leaving a relatively thick side seam. The thick side seam required that the side seam end juncture at the end curl to have more metal to curl around before closing in behind the <b>Body</b> <b>Hook</b> or flange, with a greater opportunity for error.|$|E
5000|$|Seam bump - Seam bumps are a {{relatively}} short area of the double seam, where the seam thickness suddenly increases by 0.004" [...] (0.1 mm) or more. They are predominantly found on welded and two-piece cans with long <b>body</b> <b>hooks</b> and are usually seen on the can filler's end when hot filled products exceed 185 degrees (Fahrenheit). The cover hook radius may be {{pulled away from the}} body wall.|$|R

5000|$|Traditional teardown. Although pretty rare, in {{this case}} the {{external}} measurements are made (usually consisting of seam length, seam thickness and countersink). Internal parameters are evaluated by tearing down the seam, then measuring the cover hook and <b>body</b> <b>hook</b> parameters mechanically. Then, various calculations are made to evaluate overlap. This procedure is generally considered bad form as it does not evaluate all the seam parameters on the same exact point, which can lead to missing serious defects (including false seams).|$|E
50|$|The {{seaming head}} then engages the second {{operation}} roller against the partly formed seam. The second operation presses all five steel components together tightly {{to form the}} final seal. The five layers in the final seam are then called; a) End, b) <b>Body</b> <b>Hook,</b> c) Cover Hook, d) Body, e) Countersink. All sanitary cans require a filling medium within the seam because otherwise the metal-to-metal contact will not maintain a hermetic seal. In most cases, a rubberized compound is placed inside the end curl radius, forming the critical seal between the end and the body.|$|E

5000|$|Since {{there are}} several {{parameters}} {{that can be used}} to judge seam quality, the FDA regulation specifies the most critical parameters: [...] "The most critical attributes to consider in judging the quality of the double seam are overlap and tightness (wrinkle). If one of the can seam measurements (i.e., <b>body</b> <b>hook)</b> is slightly beyond the specified guidelines but the rest of the seam is evaluated and the overlap and tightness (wrinkle) are within specified guidelines, then adjustments to the seamer can be made at the next scheduled shut-down. In this instance, the manufacturer should identify the out-of-guideline measurement and document they have evaluated the rest of the double seam, but did not find immediate corrective action necessary. However, if overlap measurement or tightness rating evaluation are below the minimum guidelines a resample from the questionable seaming station should be made. If the resample continues to show out-of-guideline measurements in overlap and/or wrinkle the machine should be stopped and adjusted." ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{rhinolith}} is a calculus {{present in}} the nasal cavity. The word {{is derived from the}} roots [...] and , literally meaning [...] "nose stone". It is an uncommon medical phenomenon, {{not to be confused with}} dried nasal mucus. A rhinolith usually forms around the nucleus of a small exogenous foreign body, blood clot or secretion by slow deposition of calcium and magnesium salts. Over a period of time, they grow into large irregular masses that fill the nasal cavity. They may cause pressure necrosis of the nasal septum or lateral wall of nose. Rhinoliths can cause nasal obstruction, epistaxis, headache, sinusitis and epiphora. They can be diagnosed from the history with unilateral foul smelling blood stained nasal discharge or by anterior rhinoscopy. On probing probe can be passed around all its corners. In both CT and MRI rhinolith will appear like a radiopaque irregular material. Small rhinoliths can be removed by foreign <b>body</b> <b>hook.</b> Whereas large rhinoliths can be removed either by crushing with luc's forceps or by Moore's lateral rhinotomy approach.|$|E
50|$|A liver punch {{is usually}} {{made with the}} left hand, or the left hook in infighting, or the regular short <b>body</b> <b>hook,</b> in a short and quick manner. The drive is usually made under and {{to the front of}} the ninth and tenth ribs upward to the base of the {{shoulder}} blade toward the spine. The punch shocks the liver, the largest gland organ, and a center of blood circulation, and causes the victim to lose focus and drive, and can cause a breathless feeling in the victim. It is usually delivered when feinting an opponent to lead with his right, which leaves the body exposed; the attacker then steps in and delivers a short, stiff uppercut, over the liver, which will likely leave the average man incapacitated. Most of the time, however, a liver punch is unintentional. It begins as a left hook to the body, but as the defending boxer puts his elbow down and begins to roll with the punch, the back is exposed. Thus, the attacking boxer is frequently offered either the arm or the back of the ribs, the latter of which he will usually take instead of the arm.|$|E

40|$|The flgM gene of Salmonella typhimurium encodes a {{negative}} regulator of flagellin synthesis that acts by inhibiting the flagellum-specific sigma factor FliA (sigma 28), {{but only when}} a mutation in a flagellar basal <b>body,</b> <b>hook,</b> or switch gene is present. We previously showed that FlgM is also necessary for the virulence of S. typhimurium in the mouse model of typhoid fever and proposed that FlgM is required to modulate {{the activity of the}} FliA sigma factor, which, in turn, regulates a gene involved in virulence. In this investigation, we observed that (i) the in vitro generation times of flgM mutant and wild-type strains of S. typhimurium were indistinguishable, as were the amounts of flagellin produced by the strains; (ii) the 50 % lethal doses of fliA mutant and wild-type strains of S. typhimurium were similar in orally infected mice; and (iii) inactivation of the FliA-regulated flagellin gene fliC in an flgM S. typhimurium mutant resulted in a virulent phenotype. Therefore, we now conclude that expression of the FliC flagellin subunit in an flgM strain is responsible for the attenuated phenotype of an flgM mutant and that FliA does not appear to positively regulate virulence genes in S. typhimurium. Our results suggest that the normal regulation of flagellum synthesis appears to be necessary for virulence and that there may be an advantage conferred in vivo by expression of a particular flagellar phenotype of S. typhimurium...|$|E
40|$|The {{bacterial}} pathogen Legionella pneumophila responds to environmental changes by differentiation. At least two forms are well described: replicative bacteria are avirulent; in contrast, transmissive bacteria express virulence traits and flagella. Phenotypic analysis, Western blotting, and electron microscopy of mutants {{of the regulatory}} genes encoding RpoN, FleQ, FleR, and FliA demonstrated that flagellin expression is strongly repressed and that the mutants are nonflagellated in the transmissive phase. Transcriptome analyses elucidated that RpoN, together with FleQ, enhances transcription of 14 out of 31 flagellar class II genes, which code for the basal <b>body,</b> <b>hook,</b> and regulatory proteins. Unexpectedly, FleQ independent of RpoN enhances the transcription of fliA encoding sigma 28. Expression analysis of a fliA mutant showed that FliA activates three out of the five remaining flagellar class III genes and the flagellar class IV genes. Surprisingly, FleR does not induce but inhibits expression of at least 14 flagellar class III genes on the transcriptional level. Thus, we propose that flagellar class II genes are controlled by FleQ and RpoN, whereas the transcription of the class III gene fliA is controlled in a FleQ-dependent but RpoN-independent manner. However, RpoN and FleR might influence flagellin synthesis on a posttranscriptional level. In contrast to the commonly accepted view that enhancer-binding proteins such as FleQ always interact with RpoN to fullfill their regulatory functions, our results strongly indicate that FleQ regulates gene expression that is RpoN dependent and RpoN independent. Finally, FliA induces expression of flagellar class III and IV genes leadin...|$|E
40|$|Flagella {{are complex}} {{structures}} with {{important roles in}} bacterial motility, virulence and protein secretion. As of yet, little work has been undertaken to characterise the function and regulation of flagella in Clostridium botulinum, an organism which produces an extremely potent neurotoxin which is the causative agent of botulism and is utilised for numerous pharmaceutical purposes. Genes encoding structural components of the flagellar basal <b>body,</b> <b>hook</b> and filament were inactivated using the ClosTron insertional mutation method, resulting in reduced swarming motility and reduced neurotoxin release from the cell into culture supernatant as determined by an ELISA method. To determine regulatory factors affecting flagellar assembly and secretion, sigD, the gene encoding δD, an alternative sigma factor that {{has been shown to}} be responsible for the expression of late flagellar genes in various bacterial species, was inactivated. The mutant strain was analysed by microarray and quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR methods. It was shown that δD positively regulates the expression of multiple genes including the late flagellar genes, the clostridiolysin S genes and an operon of secreted proteases. Phenotypic assays were performed on the sigD mutant and confirmed that it was null for motility and that proteolysis by secreted proteases was reduced. This reduced proteolysis phenotype was complemented back towards wild-type levels by the introduction of a plasmid containing the sigD gene from Clostridium sporogenes under the control of its native Pft 9 B promoter. To aid future work, a method for inducing and selecting for double homologous recombination events in C. botulinum was developed for the purpose of creating a strain in which the chromosomal botA gene is converted to a toxoid encoding sequence by allelic exchange. This work has therefore implicated flagella in the secretion of the neurotoxin, characterised the regulatory roles of δD and developed a novel method for allelic exchange in clostridia.

40|$|Leaf {{epidermal}} {{features are}} very important in grass systematics for characterization of broad groups, within subfamilies and tribes. Numerous species belonging to sub-tribe Ischaemineae, tribe Andropogoneae, family Poaceae are endemic to the Indian subcontinent, but their micromorphological reports were very scares. Therefore, foliar micromorphological characters of subtribe Ischaemineae have been studied in detail for 16 taxa of subtribe Ischaemineae from Gujarat, India. All the epidermal peels were prepared after following routine scraping method, representative areas were photographed and presented here. Structural diversity as well as metric values for both the epidermises has been recorded. In general, intercostals zones and costal zones are uniform in nature in terms of sinuous papillate long cells, cross-dumbbell-nodular shaped silica cells and triangular-low domed shaped subsidiary cells on stomata.
