5|$|Upon its {{designation}} {{the depression}} was still relatively weak and disorganized and, {{due to a}} number of factors, further strengthening was expected to be gradual. Outflow over the cyclone improved throughout the day on September19, however, as it drifted northward. At 0000UTC on September20 the depression was upgraded to the eighth named storm of the season, Tropical Storm Harvey, based on surface observations and reports from the Hurricane Hunters. Shortly thereafter the storm became nearly stationary while slowly <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> eastward. Harvey remained disorganized due to persistent wind shear. Despite the strong wind shear, the cyclone managed to reach its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 60mph (95km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 994 mbar (hPa; 29.35 inHg) late on September20.|$|E
5|$|Hours after {{attaining}} {{its peak}} intensity, Fred began to weaken as clouds {{began to fill}} the eye. By this time, the hurricane was <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> toward the northwest as a subtropical ridge to the north weakened. Continued weakening took place as dry air started to erode convection along {{the southern edge of}} the system and the eye was no longer present on satellite imagery and wind shear also increased. Convection gradually became elongated in response to the shear and outflow was mostly restricted to the northeast region of the hurricane. By September10, the mid-level circulation center was displaced from the low-level circulation center. On September11, the convective pattern of Fred had no organized shape to it and the NHC downgraded the hurricane to a tropical storm. Unrelenting shear and dry air finally took their toll on September12. By that time, no deep convection was associated with the main circulation of Fred, leaving the center fully exposed. The storm degenerated into a remnant-low later that day, corresponding with the final advisory from the National Hurricane Center.|$|E

25|$|The tide {{of public}} opinion was <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> in Kentucky, however. In a special congressional {{election}} held June 20, 1861, Unionist candidates won nine of Kentucky's ten congressional seats. Confederate sympathizers won only the Jackson Purchase region, which was economically linked to Tennessee by the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers. Seeing imminent defeat at the polls, many Southern Rights Advocates boycotted the election; {{the total number of}} ballots cast was just over half the number that had been cast in the previous year's election. Governor Magoffin was dealt a further blow in the August 5 election for state legislators. This election resulted in veto-proof Unionist majorities of 76–24 in the House and 27–11 in the Senate.|$|E

2500|$|Historian Paul Forman, in his seminal 1987 article, {{proposed}} {{that not only}} had military funding of science greatly expanded the scope and significance of American physics, it also initiated [...] "a qualitative change in its purposes and character." [...] Historians of science were <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> to the Cold War relationship between science and the military for detailed study, and Forman’s “distortionist critique” (as Roger Geiger has described it) served to focus the ensuing debates. [...] Forman and others (e.g., Robert Seidel, Stuart Leslie, and {{for the history of}} the social sciences, Ron Robin) view the influx of military money and the focus on applied rather than basic research as having had, at least partially, a negative impact on the course of subsequent research. [...] In turn, critics of the distortionist thesis, beginning with Daniel Kevles, deny that the military [...] "seduced American physicists from, so to speak, a 'true basic physics'." [...] Kevles, as well as Geiger, instead view the effects of military funding relative to such funding simply being absent—rather than put to alternate scientific use. [...] Most recent scholarship has moved toward a tempered version of Forman's thesis, in which scientists retained significant autonomy despite the radical changes brought about by military funding.|$|E
