Like many American children {{growing up in the}} turn of the century, Morgan had to quit school at a young age in order to work full-time. Morgan was privileged enough to hire a tutor and continue his studies while working in Cincinnati. In 1895, he moved to Cleveland, Ohio, where he began repairing sewing machines for a clothing manufacturer. This experience with repairing sewing machines was the impetus for Morgan's interest in how things work. His first invention, developed during this period, was a <b>belt</b> <b>fastener</b> for sewing machines. Throughout this period of time, before his first patent in 1912, he was slowly building his reputation in Cleveland for his skill at fixing things.|$|E

Hradec Králové). Most of the findings became a part of a depository of National Museum in Prague (56 finds). Eight graves with brooches, knifes, scissors and weapons are preserved. The disturbed graves have afforded a number of romanprovincial imports - bronze vessels (for example a service of a dipper and a strainer of a type Eggers 162 with a stamp of a producer C MANSVANNII) and brooches from eastern and western provinces. Distance contacts from territory of Baltic tribes are documented by a <b>belt</b> <b>fastener.</b> In the place of a present village a contemporary settlement is evidenced by field observations. The large number of imports evidently relate to a very good connection with a trade network...|$|E
