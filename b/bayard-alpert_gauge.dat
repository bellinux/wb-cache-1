30|$|In our {{previous}} work [22], we intentionally nitrided the Si substrate before {{the growth of}} GaN, and we observed GaN nanocolumns on this nitrided Si substrate. For the samples shown in this paper, we pre-deposited several monolayers of Al before igniting the N 2 plasma source to avoid nitridation of the substrate, followed by growth of an about 40 -nm-thick AlN buffer layer. Then, ten pairs of AlN (5 nm)/GaN (15 nm) multilayer were grown on the AlN buffer layer. Finally, six GaN samples were grown on the multilayer with various N/Ga ratios from 980 to 180 at 700 °C. Adjusting of N/Ga ratio was achieved by changing {{the temperature of the}} Ga cell while N 2 flow was kept constant. The N/Ga ratio is determined by the N flux/Ga flux. For convenience, Ga and N fluxes are given in terms of corresponding beam equivalent pressures measured by a <b>Bayard-Alpert</b> <b>gauge.</b> A Si-doped GaN nanowall network was also grown with a N/Ga ratio of 400 under the same growth procedure. Solid Si effusion cell heated at 1, 200 °C was used for Si doping.|$|E
5000|$|The {{low-pressure}} {{sensitivity of}} hot-cathode gauges {{is limited by}} the photoelectric effect. Electrons hitting the grid produce X-rays that produce photoelectric noise in the ion collector. This limits the range of older hot-cathode gauges to 10−8 Torr and the <b>Bayard-Alpert</b> <b>gauges</b> to about 10−10 Torr. Additional wires at cathode potential in the line of sight between the ion collector and the grid prevent this effect. In the extraction type the ions are not attracted by a wire but by an open cone. As the ions cannot decide which part of the cone to hit, they pass through the hole and form an ion beam. This ion beam can be passed on to a ...|$|R
40|$|The {{operation}} of the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at nominal beam parameters is expected for the next years. Increased synchrotron-radiation stimulated-desorption and electron-cloud build-up are expected. A deep understanding of the interactions between the proton beams and the beam pipe wall is mandatory to control the anticipated beam-induced pressure rise. A Vacuum Pilot Sector (VPS) {{has been designed to}} monitor the performance of the vacuum system with time. The VPS is installed along a double LHC room temperature vacuum sector (18 m long, 80 mm inner diameter beam pipes) and includes 8 standard modules, 1. 4 m long each. Such modules are equipped with residual gas analysers, <b>Bayard-Alpert</b> <b>gauges,</b> photon and electron flux monitors etc. The chosen modular approach opens the possibility of studying different configurations and implementing future modifications. This contribution will describe the apparatus, the control system designed to drive measurements and possible applications during the LHC Run 2...|$|R
40|$|When it {{switches}} on in 2008, the 26. 7 km Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, {{will have the}} world's largest vacuum system operating {{over a wide range}} of pressures and employing an impressive array of vacuum technologies. This system is composed by 54 km of UHV vacuum for the circulating beams and 50 km of insulation vacuum around the cryogenic magnets and the liquid helium transfer lines. Over the 54 km of UHV beam vacuum, 48 km of this are at cryogenic temperature (1. 9 K). The remaining 6 km of beam vacuum containing the insertions for "cleaning" the proton beams, radiofrequency cavities for accelerating the protons as well as beam-monitoring equipment is at ambient temperature and uses non-evaporable getter (NEG) coatings - a vacuum technology that was born and industrialized at CERN. The pumping scheme is completed using 780 ion pumps to remove noble gases and to provide pressure interlocks to the 303 vacuum safety valves. Pressure readings are provided by 170 <b>Bayard-Alpert</b> <b>gauges</b> and 1084 gauges (Pirani and cold cathode Penning). The cryogenic insulation vacuums while technically less demanding, impress by their size and volume: 50 km and 15000 m 3. Once cooled at 1. 9 K, the cryopumping allows reaching pressure in the 10 ^- 4 Pa range. This paper describes the vacuum systems and the challenges of the installation and commissioning phases...|$|R
30|$|First, Si (111) {{substrate}} was cleaned in {{the standard}} RCA cleaning process, then the native oxide of the Si substrate surface was removed and the Si surface was terminated with hydrogen by a diluted hydrogen fluoride solution (HF; H 2 O[*]=[*] 1 : 100). After substrate was dried by nitrogen blowing, the substrate was transferred in a vacuum chamber and hydrocarbons of Si substrate surface were removed by pre-heating around 10 − 5  Pa [20]. After the Si substrate {{was transferred to the}} growth chamber, several monolayers of aluminum were deposited to avoid nitridation of Si surface. Finally, nitrogen plasma was ignited and AlN nanowall structures were grown on the Si substrates at 700  °C. The RF plasma source power was fixed at 400  W. AlN crystals were grown in the N/Al flux ratios of 50, 200, 400, 550, and 660. The N/Al flux ratio was determined by the ratios of nitrogen flux and aluminum flux, which were beam equivalent pressures measured by <b>Bayard-Alpert</b> <b>gauge.</b> In order to vary the N/Al flux ratio, the aluminum flux was kept constant at 7.6 [*]×[*] 10 − 8  Torr and the nitrogen flux was changed.|$|E
30|$|The {{electron}} {{field emission}} has potential to overcome thermionic emission related problems [1 – 4] for merits such as room-temperature operation, low power consumption, and quick response capability. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) possess unique electrical, chemical, and mechanical {{as well as}} structural properties and are regarded as the most promising field emission material with low emission fields and good vacuum behaviors [5 – 14]. The “cold” cathode operation could help to reduce the outgassings, benefiting greatly the ultra-high vacuum/extreme-high vacuum (UHV/XHV) measurement. Many investigations have been conducted to employ the CNT field emission in ionization gauge applications. Murakami et al. presented a Bayard-Alpert type CNT field emission gauge and tested in 10 − 6 to 10 − 4  Torr range [15]. In 2004, Dong and Myneni developed an extractor type field emission gauge based on the MWNTs grown on Ni alloy. The gauge presented excellent measurement linearity from 10 − 10 to 10 − 6  Torr with the sensitivity of about 3  Torr− 1 [16, 17]. Huang et al. replaced thermionic filament of the <b>Bayard-Alpert</b> <b>gauge</b> (BAG) by a line-type CNT cathode, and the gauge performances were studied from 10 − 4 to 10 − 7  Torr with the sensitivity of 3.6  Torr− 1 [18]. Suto et al. developed the CNT electron source by screen printing and studied its ionization gauge application [19].The gauge responded linearly from 10 − 8 to 10 − 4  Torr with the sensitivity of 13  Torr− 1, close to the commercial gauge sensitivity. New gauge designs and structural modulations were also attempted. Sheng et al. constructed a saddle field gauge with a simple ring anode. The gauge was tested from 10 − 5 to 10 − 3  Pa with improved sensitivity of 1.7  Pa− 1 [20]. A simple triode type of CNT ionization gauge was investigated by several groups, {{but there were no}} UHV/XHV measurement results [21 – 25].|$|E
40|$|The room {{temperature}} vacuum {{system of the}} Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN {{has been designed to}} ensure vacuum stability and beam lifetime of 100 h with nominal current of 0. 56 A per beam at 7 TeV of energy. The requirements for the interaction regions are moreover driven to minimize the background noise of the experiments, to keep the equivalent hydrogen gas density below 1013 molecules of H 2 per m 3. the last two years, the LHC operated with proton beams at a maximum energy of 4 TeV, coasting for several hours each time, causing vacuum pressure increase owing to different effects: synchrotron radiation, electron cloud and localized temperature increase due to high order modes (HOMs). these phenomena liberated an important gas load from the vacuum chamber walls, which led in some cases to a partial or a total saturation of the NEG coating. To match the design vacuum performances and hence to schedule technical interventions for NEG vacuum reactivation, it is necessary to take into account all these aspects and to regularly evaluate the saturation level of the NEG coating. study analyses the saturation level of the NEG coated beam pipes in the LHC accelerator. Pressure reading variation of the <b>Bayard-Alpert</b> <b>gauges</b> without circulating proton beams are analysed and combined with laboratory studies of the NEG saturation behaviour. In addition, Vacuum Stability Code (VASCO) simulations are used to define the gas density profile change due to the saturation process in the NEG coated beam pipes...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} a CCM key comparison of absolute pressure at five National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) that {{was carried out}} from August 1998 to May 2002. The goal of the key comparison {{was to determine the}} degree of equivalence of NMI standards at pressures in the range of 3 × 10 - 6 Pa to 9 × 10 - 4 Pa. The primary standards were dynamic expansion standards at four of the NMIs and a series expansion standard at the fifth NMI. The transfer standard package consisted of two spinning rotor gauges (SRGs) and three <b>Bayard-Alpert</b> ionization <b>gauges.</b> Due to equipment malfunctions, only one of the ionization gauges was calibrated by all of the participants. The SRG measurements were used to compare NMIs at 9 × 10 - 4 Pa and to normalize the ionization gauge results at that same pressure. The ionization gauge measurements were used to compare NMIs at the lower pressures. The degrees of equivalence of the NMI standards were determined in two ways: deviations from the key comparison reference value (KCRV), and pairwise differences between those deviations. The standards of four of the NMIs show equivalence to the KCRV and each other over the full range of pressures relative to th...|$|R
40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{analysis of a}} large and representative sample of available data {{has been made to}} determine the best criteria for predicting the relative sensitivities of ionization-type vacuum gauges to different gases. The molecular property of the gas that correlates best with relative sensitivity is the ionization cross section (eV). For high-pressure ionization gauges, a cross section evaluated at 2 / 3 of the accelerating potential of the gauge is the best choice. For <b>Bayard-Alpert</b> and triode <b>gauges,</b> any of three choices are of approximately equal value. These are 100 eV cross section values, maximum cross section value for each gas, and a cross section evaluated at 2 / 3 of the accelerating potential for each gauge. For the Alphatron gauge, cross section values in the range 5000 - 10, 000 eV provide the best correlation...|$|R

The pressure map is performed with a rake consisting of five calibrated <b>Bayard–Alpert</b> hot-cathode ionization <b>gauges.</b> The plume expansion appears to be independent of anode flow rate and facility background pressure.

Comparison of axial pressure profiles on the LVTF’s centerline shows that the neutral density is nearly the same for cold flow and hot flow. The study shows that a cold flow neutral density background map accurately characterizes the neutral density in an operating Hall thruster plume...|$|R
