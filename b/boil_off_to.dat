This maximises the amount of LNG delivered but does allow tank temps to rise due to lack of evaporation. The high cargo temps can cause storage problems and offloading problems.|$|E
50|$|Recent {{advances}} in technology reliquefication plants to be fitted to vessels, allowing the <b>boil</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> be reliquefied {{and returned to the}} tanks. Because of this, the vessels' operators and builders have been able to contemplate the use of more efficient slow-speed Diesel engines (previously most LNG carriers have been steam turbine-powered). Exceptions are the LNG carrier Havfru (built as Venator in 1973), which originally had dual fuel diesel engines, and its sister-ship Century (built as Lucian in 1974), also built with dual fuel gas turbines before being converted to a diesel engine system in 1982.|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} NASA {{has had a}} renewed {{interest}} in oxygen and methane as propellants for propulsion. The drive for this combination comes from several factors including ease of land-based storage, handling safety, in situ resource utilization, and a relatively clean burning process when compared with the widely used hypergolic propellants. This project {{is part of a larger}} goal of the Center for Space Exploration Technology Research (cSETR) to better understand all aspects of using LOX/CH 4 propellants to create future hardware that is specially optimized for these propellants. This paper discusses the literature background and reasons that led to the design of a swirl torch igniter that uses a spark ignition system meant to be used as a main engine ignition source. The main goal is to create a flammability map for all phases of propellant inlet conditions to determine what temperature, pressure, and flow rate combinations will lead to reliable and repeatable ignition. This comes from the contemplation that the torch igniter will be fed from the main engine 2 ̆ 7 s tank <b>boil</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> eliminate the need for extra tanks and to reduce the overall weight of the propulsion system. The current data encompasses flammability maps for three out of six combinations as well as the discussion of design changes that lead to successful ignition of liquid propellants. Possible design changes as well as the goal of future tests are also discussed. ...|$|E
50|$|In LNG {{storage tanks}} if LNG vapours are not released, the {{pressure}} and temperature within the tank will continue to rise. LNG is a cryogen, and is kept in its liquid state at very low temperatures. The temperature within the tank will remain constant if the pressure is kept constant by allowing the <b>boil</b> <b>off</b> gas <b>to</b> escape from the tank. This is known as auto-refrigeration.|$|R

50|$|The insulation, as {{efficient}} as it is, will not keep LNG cold enough by itself. Inevitably, heat leakage will warm and vapourise the LNG. Industry practice is to store LNG as a boiling cryogen. That is, the liquid is stored at its boiling point for the pressure at which it is stored (atmospheric pressure). As the vapour <b>boils</b> <b>off,</b> heat for the phase change cools the remaining liquid. Because the insulation is very efficient, only a relatively small amount of <b>boil</b> <b>off</b> is necessary <b>to</b> maintain temperature. This phenomenon is also called auto-refrigeration.|$|R

50|$|The A-type package boiler has two water {{drums and}} one steam drum {{compared}} to the D-type package boiler. Water <b>boils</b> <b>off</b> in the water drums shared by a common header, then sent up the generating tubes, into the steam drum and up the dry pipe.

50|$|Achieving {{high vacuum}} is {{difficult}} {{because all of the}} materials exposed to the vacuum must be carefully evaluated for their outgassing and vapor pressure properties.

He describes how a Catholic saint, Hyacinth, bested an Arian rival by plucking a stone from a boiling cauldron.

50|$|Devil's venom was a {{nickname}} coined by Soviet rocket scientists for a liquid rocket fuel {{composed of a}} dangerous combination of nitric acid and hydrazine—specifically, hypergolic UDMH-nitric acid. Both propellants are extremely dangerous, nitric acid is highly corrosive, and the type used gives off nitrogen dioxide, while UDMH is toxic and carcinogenic, but is used in rocketry because this combination of fuel and oxidizer is hypergolic (it does not require an external ignition source), which makes rockets using these materials simpler. Further, both the fuel and oxidizer have high boiling points compared to other rocket fuels such as liquid hydrogen, and oxidizers such as liquid oxygen, allowing rockets to be stored ready for launch for long periods without the fuel or oxidizer <b>boiling</b> <b>off</b> and needing <b>to</b> be replenished.|$|R

50|$|In 1954 Test Laboratory {{director}} Karl Heimburg began {{construction of}} the Static Test Stand for Redstone testing. This was still under construction when it was re-purposed for Jupiter, and finally competed in January 1957. A Jupiter was installed in the stand that month, and fired {{for the first time}} on 12 February 1957. This almost ended in disaster when a small explosion went off in the liquid oxygen (LOX) pump, and as the missile sat there the LOX <b>boiled</b> <b>off</b> and threatened <b>to</b> burst the tanks. The day was saved when the foreman, Paul Kennedy, ran to the missile and connected a pressure line to drain the oxygen buildup in the tank. The problem was later traced to the lubricant used in the pump, which tended to burst into flames in contact with LOX. A new lubricant was introduced, along with a series of changes to the test stand to help retain control in these situations.|$|R

40|$|For NASA's Apollo program, McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Company, Huntington Beach, California, {{developed}} {{and built the}} S-IVB, uppermost stage of the three-stage Saturn V moonbooster. An {{important part of the}} development task was fabrication of a tank to contain liquid hydrogen fuel for the stage's rocket engine. The liquid hydrogen had to be contained at the supercold temperature of 423 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. The tank had to be perfectly insulated to keep engine or solar heat from reaching the fuel; if the hydrogen were permitted to warm up, it would have <b>boiled</b> <b>off,</b> or converted <b>to</b> gaseous form, reducing the amount of fuel available to the engine. McDonnell Douglas' answer was a supereffective insulation called 3 D, which consisted of a one-inch thickness of polyurethane foam reinforced in three dimensions with fiberglass threads. Over a 13 -year development and construction period, the company built 30 tanks and never experienced a failure. Now, after years of additional development, an advanced version of 3 D is finding application as part of a containment system for transporting Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) by ship...|$|R
50|$|<b>Boil</b> <b>off</b> rate {{is governed}} by heat leakage and by the {{quantity}} of propellant in the tanks. With partially filled tanks, the percentage loss is higher. Heat leakage depends on surface area, while the original mass of propellant in the tanks depends on volume.

25|$|The Mark I {{containment}} {{was used}} in those reactors at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant which {{were involved in the}} Fukushima I nuclear accidents. The site suffered from a combination of two beyond design-basis events, a powerful earthquake which may have damaged reactor plumbing and structures and 15 meter tsunami which destroyed fuel tanks, generators and wiring causing back up generators to fail, and battery-powered pumps also eventually failed. Insufficient cooling and failure of pumps needed to restore water lost <b>to</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>off</b> led <b>to</b> partial or possible complete meltdowns of fuel rods which were completely uncovered by water. This led to releases of significant amounts of radioactive material to the air and sea, and hydrogen explosions. However PWR reactors also require years of powered pumped cooling water. The thin secondary containments were not designed to withstand hydrogen explosions, and suffered blown out or destroyed roofs and walls, and destruction of all equipment on the refueling floor including cranes and refueling platform. Unit 3 suffered a particularly spectacular explosion which created a plume of debris over 300m high which resulted in a collapse of {{the north end of the}} top floor, and buckled concrete columns on its west side as can be seen by aerial photographs. Although they were fitted with modified hardened vent systems to vent hydrogen into exhaust stacks, they may have not been effective without power. Unit 2 had a large panel removed to vent gases, but suffered an explosion to the lower suppression area. Even before the Fukushima incident, Mark I containment had been criticized as being more likely to fail during a blackout.|$|R
