25|$|May 6, 2011, Boynton Beach, Florida, {{a female}} police officer is treated for hearing loss after a fellow officer {{deliberately}} places and activates a taser <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|E
25|$|Clinton was {{scheduled}} {{to return to work}} the week of December 31, but then on December 30 was admitted to New York-Presbyterian Hospital for treatment and observation after a blood clot related to the concussion was discovered. On December 31 it was announced that the clot was <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear</b> near her brain, specifically a right transverse sinus venous thrombosis, that she was being treated with anticoagulants, that she had not suffered any neurological damage, and that she was expected to make a full recovery.|$|E
500|$|Keable {{remained}} in Tahiti, his health worsening. He suffered weight loss, diabetes, {{high blood pressure}} and fever, all stemming from a kidney illness. Nonetheless, he completed the novel Numerous Treasure, which he had begun before Buck's death; the bittersweet tale of a Polynesian woman who shared her name with a cocktail and a brand of cigarettes was a commercial success, and has been considered a valuable portrait of early-century Tahitian life. His health and spirits rallied in the years after Buck's death: he completed a travel book, Tahiti, Isle of Dreams, and a book tour of the United States and Europe. On returning to Tahiti he struck up a relationship with a mixed-race islander named Ina, and made many new friends including the writers Alec Waugh (elder brother of Evelyn), who had been inspired to visit Tahiti by Numerous Treasure, Zane Grey, and James Norman Hall. Waugh described the Keable of this period [...] "reclined among cushions, clad only in a pareo, while his Tahitian princess, bare-shouldered and bare-footed, her black hair falling to her waist and a white flower <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear,</b> glided negligently about the house" [...] – and yet noted that, on suggesting a cup of tea, Keable's voice still took on [...] "the parsonical intonation with which fifteen years earlier he had summoned the parish children to a Sunday school treat." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{appearance}} she has {{brown hair}} similar {{in length and}} cut behind as Shoko Mataki, wearing it <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ears.</b> In front she has several wisps on her forehead. She wears glasses, and often her doctor's coat.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it all settled, Harry?" [...] said Fanny, {{stopping}} {{with her}} brother, and hanging over his chair. She was a pretty, gay-spirited girl, with bright eyes and dark brown hair, which fell in two curls <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ears.</b>|$|R
60|$|Philip drew a large miniature-case {{from his}} pocket, and opened it. Maggie saw her old self leaning on a table, with her black locks hanging down <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ears,</b> looking into space, with strange, dreamy eyes. It was a water-color sketch, of real merit as a portrait.|$|R
6000|$|Rose had by {{this time}} sprung up on the banquette, and flinging back her rich tresses of fair hair, had applied her hand <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear</b> to collect the distant sound. [...] "I hear it," [...] she cried, [...] "and it increases--Awake them, for Heaven's sake, and without a moment's delay!" ...|$|E
60|$|Armed {{with this}} virtuous resolution, Christie sternly {{replaced}} the pretty hat with her old brown one, fastened up a becoming curl, which of late {{she had worn}} <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear,</b> {{and put on a}} pair of stout, rusty boots, much fitter for rocks and sand than the smart slippers she was preparing to sacrifice. Then she trudged away to Miss Tudor, bent on being very quiet and reserved, as became a meek and lowly governess.|$|E
60|$|Dick murmured {{something}} about never wanting {{a friend or}} a bottle to give him, and also gasped forth his favourite allusion to the wing of friendship and its never moulting a feather; but his faculties appeared to be absorbed in the contemplation of Miss Sally Brass, at whom he stared with blank and rueful looks, which delighted the watchful dwarf beyond measure. As to the divine Miss Sally herself, she rubbed her hands as men of business do, and took a few turns {{up and down the}} office with her pen <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, bother, never mind! Come, it's {{time for}} me to learn my lessons. See here what I've got to do," [...] Tom went on, drawing Maggie towards him, and showing her his theorem, while she pushed <b>her</b> hair <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ears,</b> and {{prepared}} herself to help him in Euclid.|$|R
50|$|Betsy Ray (Elizabeth Warrington Ray)- {{the main}} {{character}} of the series, based on Maud Hart Lovelace herself as a child. Betsy is a gregarious, imaginative child who dreams of being a writer. She loves to tell stories above all else. She is described as chunky with brown braids that stick out from <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ears.</b>|$|R
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of Eulalia Arrita de Perez, Pasadena, [s. d]. The portrait shows the bust {{of an elderly}} woman in a button-down top, over which a shawl is draped. Her hair is combed back and falls <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ears.</b> The crenulations in her lips suggest that she is missing teeth. Her eyes are averted...|$|R
60|$|There was {{a little}} table near the fire, and beside it sat Lady Marchmont, writing notes, in the plainest and most {{becoming}} of morning dresses,--a sort of brown holland looking thing, with a plain, stiff, white collar, and a dark blue ribbon, her only ornament, except one large gold bracelet. Her hair was twisted in glossy sunny waves <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear,</b> as in some Greek statues; her blue eyes were bright and lustrous, and nothing was ever clearer and more delicate than the slight tinge of red on her cheeks. Lord Marchmont was standing leaning on the mantelshelf, apparently in consultation with her.|$|E
60|$|Racked {{by these}} {{conflicting}} impulses of self-preservation {{on the one}} hand and what seemed self-realization on the other, she started when, toward the middle of the afternoon, she heard Ditmar's voice summoning her to take his letters; and went palpitating, leaving the door open behind her, seating herself on the far side of the desk, her head bent over her book. Her neck, where her hair grew in wisps <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear,</b> seemed to burn: Ditmar's glance was focussed there. Her hands were cold as she wrote.... Then, like a deliverer, she saw young Caldwell coming in from the outer office, holding a card in his hand which he gave to Ditmar, who sat staring at it.|$|E
60|$|For {{one moment}} Shirley looked not quite certain {{whether she would}} obey the request or {{disregard}} it. A flicker of her eye beamed furtive on the professor's face. Perhaps {{if he had been}} looking at her harshly or timidly, or if one undecided line had marked his countenance, she would have rebelled, and the lesson had ended there and then; but he was only awaiting her compliance--as calm as marble, and as cool. She threw the veil of tresses <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear.</b> It was well her face owned an agreeable outline, and that her cheek possessed the polish and the roundness of early youth, or, thus robbed of a softening shade, the contours might have lost their grace. But what mattered that in the present society? Neither Calypso nor Eucharis cared to fascinate Mentor.|$|E
50|$|Since 2006, Marc Quinn {{has made}} {{numerous}} {{studies of the}} supermodel Kate Moss. In April 2006, Sphinx, a sculpture of Kate Moss by Quinn was revealed. The sculpture shows Moss in a yoga position with her ankles and arms wrapped <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ears.</b> This body of work culminated in an exhibition at the Mary Boone Gallery in New York in May 2007. The sculpture is on permanent display in Folketeatret in Oslo, Norway.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, then, {{come with}} me into the study, Maggie," [...] said Tom, as their father drove away. [...] "What do you shake and toss your head now for, you silly?" [...] he continued; for though her hair was now under a new dispensation, and was brushed {{smoothly}} <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ears,</b> she seemed still in imagination to be tossing {{it out of her}} eyes. [...] "It makes you look as if you were crazy." ...|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a {{half-tone}} print of {{a portrait of}} Señora Concepcion Lopez de Palomares, daughter of Claudia Lopez Palomares, Pomona Valley, ca. 1870 - 1879. From the chest up. She has a square jaw and narrowed eyes. Her straight hair is parted {{in the middle and}} drawn back <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ears.</b> She is wearing a scarf crossed at her neck and held with a cameo(?) brooch. She is turned slightly to her left. In an oval cutout...|$|R
60|$|He {{abruptly}} {{drew her}} head to his shoulder, smoothed her hair. She felt his fingers again communicate to her every nerve a tingling electric force. She felt his lips quest along her cheek and discover the soft little spot just <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear.</b> She followed the restless course of his hands across her shoulders, down her arm, lingeringly over her hand. His hand seemed to her to have an existence quite apart from him, to have a mysterious existence of its own. In silence they rested there. She kept wondering if his shoulder had not been made just for her cheek. With little shivers she {{realized that this was}} his shoulder, Walter's, a man's, as the rough cloth prickled her skin. Silent they were, and for a time secure, but she kept speculating as to what he would dare to do next--and she fancied that he was speculating about precisely the same thing.|$|E
6000|$|Another {{beautiful}} touch {{was that}} displayed by the [...] "Hopper" [...] and his [...] "ole woman." [...] He {{had been in}} line about half-an-hour when the [...] "ole woman" [...] (his mate) came up to him. She was fairly clad, for her class, with a weather- worn bonnet on her grey head and a sacking-covered bundle in her arms. As she talked to him, he reached forward, caught the one stray wisp of the white hair that was flying wild, deftly twirled it between his fingers, and tucked it back properly <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear.</b> From all of which one may conclude many things. He certainly liked her well enough to wish her to be neat and tidy. He was proud of her, {{standing there in the}} spike line, and it was his desire that she should look well {{in the eyes of the}} other unfortunates who stood in the spike line. But last and best, and underlying all these motives, it was a sturdy affection he bore her; for man is not prone to bother his head over neatness and tidiness in a woman for whom he does not care, nor is he likely to be proud of such a woman.|$|E
60|$|Such {{might have}} been the case with Mr. Smith, when, through the {{brilliant}} medium of his glass of old Madeira, he beheld three figures entering the room. These were Fancy, who had assumed the garb and aspect of an itinerant showman, with a box of pictures on her back; and Memory, in the likeness of a clerk, with a pen <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear,</b> an inkhorn at her buttonhole and a huge manuscript volume beneath her arm; and lastly, behind the other two, a person shrouded in a dusky mantle which concealed both face and form. But Mr. Smith had a shrewd idea that it was Conscience. How kind of Fancy, Memory and Conscience to visit the old gentleman just as he was beginning to imagine that the wine had neither so bright a sparkle nor so excellent a flavor as when himself and the liquor were less aged! Through the dim length of the apartment, where crimson curtains muffled the glare of sunshine and created a rich obscurity, the three guests drew near the silver-haired old man. Memory, with a finger between the leaves of her huge volume, placed herself at his right hand; Conscience, with her face still hidden in the dusky mantle, took her station on the left, so as to be next his heart; while Fancy set down her picture-box upon the table with the magnifying-glass convenient to his eye.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's only a joke, sir," [...] she said, coolly lifting {{herself to}} her feet by {{grasping}} his arm. [...] "I'm Mrs. Dall, the Indian agent's wife. They said you wouldn't let anybody see you--and I determined I would. That's all!" [...] She stopped, threw back <b>her</b> tangled curls <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ears,</b> shook the briers and thorns from her skirt, and added: [...] "Well, I reckon you aren't afraid of a woman, are you? So no harm's done. Good-by!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Utamaro {{portrays the}} geisha Rokō of the Tatsumi {{district}} ( [...] Tatsumi Rokō). She poses {{with her right}} hand placed <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> right <b>ear</b> and the cord to an incense pouch is visible around her neck.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, bother! never mind! Come, it's {{time for}} me to learn my lessons. See here! what I've got to do," [...] said Tom, drawing Maggie toward him and showing her his theorem, while she pushed <b>her</b> hair <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ears,</b> and {{prepared}} herself to prove her capability of helping him in Euclid. She began to read with full confidence in her own powers, but presently, becoming quite bewildered, her face flushed with irritation. It was unavoidable; she must confess her incompetency, and she was not fond of humiliation.|$|R
60|$|Let us {{illustrate}} the subject by an imaginary example. A venerable gentleman, one Mr. Smith, {{who had long}} been regarded as a pattern of moral excellence, was warming his aged blood with a glass or two of generous wine. His children being gone forth about their worldly business, and his grandchildren at school, he sat alone, in a deep, luxurious arm-chair, with his feet beneath a richly carved mahogany table. Some old people have a dread of solitude, and when better company may not be had, rejoice even to hear the quiet breathing of a babe, asleep upon the carpet. But Mr. Smith, whose silver hair was the bright symbol of a life unstained, except by such spots as are inseparable from human nature, he had no need of a babe to protect him by its purity, nor of a grown person to stand {{between him and his}} own soul. Nevertheless, either Manhood must converse with Age, or Womanhood must soothe him with gentle cares, or Infancy must sport around his chair, or his thoughts will stray into the misty region of the past, and the old man be chill and sad. Wine will not always cheer him. Such might have been the case with Mr. Smith, when, through the brilliant medium of his glass of old Madeira, he beheld three figures entering the room. These were Fancy, who had assumed the garb and aspect of an itinerant showman, with a box of pictures on her back; and Memory, in the likeness of a clerk, with a pen <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear,</b> an inkhorn at her buttonhole, and a huge manuscript volume beneath her arm; and lastly, behind the other two, a person shrouded in a dusky mantle, which concealed both face and form. But Mr. Smith had a shrewd idea that it was Conscience.|$|E
6000|$|MY DEAREST COLVIN, - I was sharply ill at Sydney, cut off, {{right out}} of bed, in this steamer on a fresh island cruise, and have already reaped the benefit. We are {{excellently}} found this time, on a spacious vessel, with an excellent table; the captain, supercargo, our one fellow-passenger, etc., very nice; and the charterer, Mr. Henderson, the very man I could have chosen. The truth is, I fear, this life {{is the only one}} that suits me; so long as I cruise in the South Seas, I shall be well and happy - alas, no, I do not mean that, and ABSIT OMEN! - I mean that, so soon as I cease from cruising, the nerves are strained, the decline commences, and I steer slowly but surely back to bedward. We left Sydney, had a cruel rough passage to Auckland, for the JANET is the worst roller I was ever aboard of. I was confined to my cabin, ports closed, self shied out of the berth, stomach (pampered till the day I left on a diet of perpetual egg-nogg) revolted at ship's food and ship eating, in a frowsy bunk, clinging with one hand to the plate, with the other to the glass, and using the knife and fork (except at intervals) with the eyelid. No matter: I picked up hand over hand. After a day in Auckland, we set sail again; were blown up in the main cabin with calcium fires, as we left the bay. Let no man say I am unscientific: when I ran, on the alert, out of my stateroom, and found the main cabin incarnadined with the glow of the last scene of a pantomime, I stopped dead: 'What is this?' said I. 'This ship is on fire, I see that; but why a pantomime?' And I stood and reasoned the point, until my head was so muddled with the fumes that I could not find the companion. A few seconds later, the captain had to enter crawling on his belly, and took days to recover (if he has recovered) from the fumes. By singular good fortune, we got the hose down in time and saved the ship, but Lloyd lost most of his clothes and a great part of our photographs was destroyed. Fanny saw the native sailors tossing overboard a blazing trunk; she stopped them in time, and behold, it contained my manuscripts. Thereafter we had three (or two) days fine weather: then got into a gale of wind, with rain and a vexatious sea. As we drew into our anchorage in a bight of Savage Island, a man ashore told me afterwards the sight of the JANET NICOLL made him sick; and indeed it was rough play, though nothing to the night before. All through this gale I worked four to six hours per diem, spearing the ink-bottle like a flying fish, and holding my papers together as I might. For, of all things, what I was at was history - the Samoan business - and I had to turn from one to another of these piles of manuscript notes, and from one page to another in each, until I should have found employment for the hands of Briareus. All the same, this history is a godsend for a voyage; I can put in time, getting events co-ordinated and the narrative distributed, when my much-heaving numskull would be incapable of finish or fine style. At Savage we met the missionary barque JOHN WILLIAMS. I tell you it was a great day for Savage Island: the path up the cliffs was crowded with gay islandresses (I like that feminine plural) who wrapped me in their embraces, and picked my pockets of all my tobacco, with a manner which a touch would have made revolting, but as it was, was simply charming, like the Golden Age.
