On the 3 July episode of NXT, Lynch {{teamed up with}} Bayley in a losing effort to the BFFs: Beautiful Fierce Females (NXT Women's Champion Charlotte and Sasha Banks) in a tag team match. Lynch spent {{the next few months}} in non-title matches against Charlotte, losing three in a row. On the 23 October episode of NXT, after <b>being</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> make herself relevant, Lynch aligned herself with Sasha Banks by attacking Bayley, turning into a villainess in the process. Known as Team B.A.E. (Best at Everything), the alliance started to disintegrate when Banks cost Lynch a match against Bayley in February 2015.|$|E
5|$|New {{locomotives}} {{were ordered}} from Stephenson's, {{but the first}} was too heavy when it arrived in February 1828. It was rebuilt with six wheels and hailed as a great improvement, Hackworth <b>being</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> convert the remaining locomotives as soon as possible. In 1828 two locomotive boilers exploded within four months, both killing the driver and both due to the safety valves being left fixed down while the engine was stationary. Horses were also used on the line, and they could haul up to four waggons. The dandy cart was introduced in mid-1828: a small cart {{at the end of}} the train, this carried the horse downhill, allowing it to rest and the train to run at higher speed. The S made their use compulsory from November 1828.|$|E
5|$|Rodrigues {{is taken}} to Nagasaki, where he is imprisoned with many Japanese converts. At a tribunal, he is told Catholic {{doctrine}} is anathema to Japan. Rodrigues demands to see governor Inoue Masashige, who he learns, to his dismay, is the old man seated before him {{in charge of the}} proceedings. Rodrigues is returned to prison, and Kichijiro soon arrives to be imprisoned as well. He explains to Rodrigues that court officials threatened him in order that he betray Rodrigues. Kichijiro then says he is a Christian and asks to be absolved of his betrayal through a confession, which Rodrigues reluctantly grants him. He later is released after <b>being</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> step on a fumi-e (a crudely carved crucifix), an act symbolizing rejection of the faith. Later, Rodrigues is brought under guard to the shoreline to await someone. In the far distance, he witnesses an emaciated Garupe and three other prisoners approaching on the shoreline under separate guard. Still in the distance, the three other prisoners are taken offshore on a small boat and are about to be drowned from the boat one-by-one as an inducement to get Garupe to renounce his faith. Rodrigues is restrained by guards on shore as he watches Garupe refuse to apostatize. He then sees the desperate Garupe drowned next to the other three prisoners when he attempts to swim offshore trying to rescue the last prisoner from being drowned.|$|E

25|$|Though {{air traffic}} was not heavy at Los Angeles airport, the local {{controller}} was distracted as Flight 1493 was on final approach {{by a series}} of abnormalities, including an aircraft that inadvertently switched off the tower frequency and a misplaced flight progress strip, which resulted in the SkyWest flight <b>being</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> taxi into takeoff position while the USAir flight was landing on the same runway without the Metroliner ever being given a takeoff clearance.|$|E
25|$|On 10 February 1975, the Provisional IRA and British {{government}} {{entered into}} a truce and restarted negotiations. The IRA agreed to halt attacks on the British security forces, and the security forces mostly ended its raids and searches. However, there were dissenters on both sides. Some Provisionals {{wanted no part of}} the truce, while British commanders resented <b>being</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> stop their operations against the IRA just when—they claimed—they had the Provisionals on the run. The security forces boosted their intelligence offensive during the truce and thoroughly infiltrated the IRA.|$|E

Pain can often be helped with drug or other treatment but the numbness is usually resistant to treatment.

[...] Named after his uncle Frederick, he was born on 28April 1938 and brought up in the historic Lancashire town of Bolton, then a predominantly industrial town with a history in the spinning and weaving of cotton. As a child, Dibnah was fascinated by {{the sights and sounds of}} industry and the dozens of chimney stacks visible around Burnden Park, and paid particular attention to the steeplejacks he saw on his way to school. [...] A popular pastime for local children was playing around the many mill lodges (industrial ponds) which once littered the area.

500|$|According to author John Tschohl, the tediousness of {{the phrase}} is {{exemplified}} by employees uttering the words so faintly as to be barely audible. The phrase is occasionally used in an ironic manner when others have been disrespectful or have negatively impacted the speaker. In Detroit, a supermarket started a program to have its cashiers tell every customer to [...] "have a nice day" [...] after completing their transactions. After conducting surveys, they realized {{that more than half}} of the customers were unaware of whether the clerk had said the phrase. In addition, a number of customers commented that they despised <b>being</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> [...] "have a nice day". In a 2006 study, researchers at Frankfurt University discovered that people who must smile and say [...] "have a nice day" [...] in their jobs are more prone to illness. Flight attendants, waiters, and call center operators, as well as others who are forced to act cheerfully, are more likely to become depressed. This can lead to decreased immune system function.|$|E

Despite this run-in he later befriends Victor, and they frequently chat in their gardens, where Victor is often surprised by Mr Swainey's activities, ranging from archery and preparing amateur dramatics props, to bizarre games he arranges for his bedridden senile mother, whom the audience never actually see. Despite his cheery demeanour, he does occasionally drop his guard, once displaying apparent depression at being nothing more than [...] "an overgrown boy-scout". Following his mother's death, he moved house near the end of the series, but only went as far as the Trenches'/McVitie's old house, claiming he'd always wanted to live in an [...] "end house, without leaving the area".

Pen and the Ice King fight while Jake remains outside flirting with Lady Rainicorn, ignoring the battle. Just when Pen seems to be gaining the upper hand, the Ice King uses his [...] "frozen lightning bolts" [...] to freeze Pen in a block of ice. For unexplained reasons, this transports Pen's mind back in time, and to Mars, where he has a short motivational conversation with Abraham Lincoln. After <b>being</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> believe in himself, Pen's mind is returned to the present, where he breaks out of the ice, {{just in time to see}} the Ice King fly away with Princess Bubblegum.

The Ice King then plummets off screen, yelling a long list of complex threats of things he will do when he returns. The story closes with Princess Bubblegum giving Pen a kiss; he enjoys it, but is also greatly embarrassed by the act. He attempts to leave, but Jake claims that they have nowhere else to go and that there are no adventures that need them. However, some nearby ninjas are stealing an old man's diamonds, and they both run off in pursuit.|$|E
500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{reviewed the}} episode, giving it high marks saying it [...] "proves yet again that 30 Rock {{is worthy of}} the Best Comedy Emmy" [...] and scored the episode a 9.2 out of 10. Sean Gandert of Paste magazine also reviewed [...] "Season 4", saying it did [...] "little to disappoint and in fact starts the show off on much stronger footing than the first couple episodes of season 3." [...] Gandert said the episode [...] "doesn't have quite as many truly classic moments as the show's peaks in seasons one and two" [...] but that [...] "it also never really hits a sour note." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad enjoyed the economic crisis, cutbacks, and corporate bonuses theme in the episode, explaining {{that one of the}} reasons he loves the show [...] "is because it can take something that's in the news and make it the plot of an episode without it feeling weird or forced." [...] Sassone wrote that despite [...] "Season 4" [...] not being the best episode of 30 Rock [...] "it was still very good." [...] TV Guides Michael Anthony commented that Steve Buscemi is [...] "so weird and yet does it in such an endearing way." [...] Mary McNamara for the Los Angeles Times called Kenneth's strike one of the more hilarious strikes in history. Entertainment Weeklys Margaret Lyons noted that this episode of 30 Rock had strong moments [...] "and was a solid start to the new season". David Zurawik, a contributor for The Baltimore Sun, liked the episode and enjoyed Buscemi's appearance, noting he [...] "brings just the right mix of sleaze and smiles to the role." [...] The Chicago Sun-Times Paige Wiser noted, [...] "...tonight's season premiere, the hype is warranted: 30 Rock is in all its glory."

500|$|Featuring [...] "multi-layered" [...] lyrics, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] {{has been}} the subject of various interpretations; common inferences range from an adventurous {{teenager}} seeking independence from overprotective parenting, to [...] "deeper meaning relating to gender" [...] and longing to be part of [...] "a different kind of society". The overall sentiment remains empowering. The line [...] "Bet you on land, they understand/Bet they don't reprimand their daughters/Bright young women sick of swimming, ready to stand" [...] has been widely interpreted as a feminist statement. Jenny Shelton, writing for Standard Issue Magazine, identified [...] "Part of Your World" [...] as [...] "a protest song" [...] that is both proactive and pro-feminist. Thought Catalogs Zaron Burnett III described the lyrics as [...] "feminist-sounding". One critic believes that since [...] "Part of Your World" [...] was released in 1989 during [...] "an uncertain time for women" [...] amidst backlash resulting from the women's movement, the song [...] "could represent the disillusionment of women in this decade – sick of <b>being</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> settle with their lot and placate their dreams of true liberation with capitalist consumerism; in the same way that Ariel has been forced to satiate her true desires with meaningless trophies by her father’s patriarchal subjugation." [...] A number of critics have also identified the song's lyrics as an allegory for the LGBT community seeking public acceptance and a place in which they feel as though they belong. BuzzFeed's Chris Hernandez wrote that closeted gay people can [...] "relate to Ariel's longing to be a part of a world that is immensely different than the one she's living in" [...] and [...] "that there is freedom in that world." [...] Writing for KQED, Tony Bravo agreed that [...] "Part of Your World" [...] discusses [...] "The longing that all gay kids feel to belong". Citing that Ashman himself was openly gay, Tinker Belles and Evil Queens: The Walt Disney Company from the Inside Out author Sean P. Griffin wrote that the lyricist uses the song to demonstrate [...] "a gay dilemma of trying to choose between different worlds" [...] by discussing [...] "fantasy, escape and forbidden romance." ...|$|E
