5|$|Greinke {{returned}} to the rotation in 2008 and performed well that season. He made 32 starts in 2008 and finished with a 13-10 record along with 183 strikeouts. His 3.47 ERA was the <b>best</b> <b>by</b> a full-time Royals starter in 11 years. On January 26, 2009, he agreed to a four-year contract with the Royals worth $38million.|$|E
5|$|In the Third Test against New Zealand in 2000, Gilchrist {{recorded}} the third best Test performance ever by a wicketkeeper, and the <b>best</b> <b>by</b> an Australian, taking ten catches in the match. Although Gilchrist's batting was modest, yielding 144 runs at 36.00, Australia took a 3–0 clean sweep. In two {{home and away}} ODI series against South Africa, Gilchrist had a quiet time, scoring 170 runs at 26.66. South Africa won three of the six matches, with one tie.|$|E

Minneapolis VA Medical Center, Shriners Hospitals for Children and Allina's Phillips Eye Institute also serve the city. The Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota is a 75-minute drive away.|$|E
5|$|After the crisis, superpower {{relations}} improved, as Kennedy gave a conciliatory {{speech at}} American University on 10 June 1963, recognizing the Soviet people's suffering during World War II, and paying tribute to their achievements. Khrushchev called the speech the <b>best</b> <b>by</b> a U.S. president since Franklin Roosevelt, and, in July, negotiated a {{test ban treaty}} with U.S. negotiator Averell Harriman and with Lord Hailsham of the United Kingdom. Plans for a second Khrushchev-Kennedy summit were dashed by the U.S. President's assassination in November 1963. The new U.S. President, Lyndon Johnson, hoped for continued improved relations but was distracted by other issues and had little opportunity to develop a relationship with Khrushchev before the premier was ousted.|$|E
5|$|At his father's urging after graduation, Coolidge {{moved to}} Northampton, Massachusetts {{to become a}} lawyer. To avoid the cost of law school, Coolidge {{followed}} the common practice of apprenticing with a local law firm, Hammond & Field, and reading law with them. John C. Hammond and Henry P. Field, both Amherst graduates, introduced Coolidge to law practice in the county seat of Hampshire County. In 1897, Coolidge {{was admitted to the}} Massachusetts bar, becoming a country lawyer. With his savings and a small inheritance from his grandfather, Coolidge opened his own law office in Northampton in 1898. He practiced commercial law, believing that he served his clients <b>best</b> <b>by</b> staying out of court. As his reputation as a hard-working and diligent attorney grew, local banks and other businesses began to retain his services.|$|E

5|$|Batesian mimicry {{is a case}} of {{protective}} or defensive mimicry, where the mimic does <b>best</b> <b>by</b> avoiding confrontations with the signal receiver. It is a disjunct system, which means that all three parties are from different species. Batesian mimicry stands in contrast to other forms such as aggressive mimicry, where the mimic profits from interactions with the signal receiver. One such case of this is in fireflies, where females of one species mimic the mating signals of another species, deceiving males to come close enough for them to eat. Mimicry need not involve a predator at all though. Such is the case in dispersal mimicry, where the mimic once again benefits from the encounter. For instance, some fungi have their spores dispersed by insects by smelling like carrion. In protective mimicry, the meeting between mimic and dupe is not such a fortuitous occasion for the mimic, and the signals it mimics tend to lower the probability of such an encounter.|$|E
5|$|England won the toss {{and elected}} to bat on an ideal batting pitch. Hutton and Washbrook {{put on an}} opening {{partnership}} of 168, the <b>best</b> <b>by</b> England in the series. Washbrook refrained from the hook shot, which had caused him to lose his wicket on earlier occasions in the series. The partnership was ended when Hutton was bowled by Lindwall. Washbrook reached his century and joined by Edrich, the pair batted {{until late in the}} first day, when Washbrook was dismissed by Johnston for 143 in the last over of the day. His innings had included 22 boundaries and ended a second-wicket partnership that yielded exactly 100 runs. Bedser was sent in as the nightwatchman and survived as England closed at 268/2, with Edrich on 41.|$|E

5|$|Entering 2008, the Bulls {{sought to}} build off of their 2007 season, where {{they shared the}} MAC East {{championship}} but did {{not appear in the}} championship game due to a 31–28 loss to fellow division co-champion Miami (Ohio). Their 5–7 final record, while not good enough to qualify for a bowl game, was still the <b>best</b> <b>by</b> a Buffalo team since they had moved up to Division I-A in 1999. With 10 starters returning on offense and eight on defense, the 2008 team was predicted to be perhaps the most talented team in Bulls history; however, due to their challenging schedule, their final record was predicted to be no better than 3–9.|$|E
5|$|In 1956–57, his {{penultimate}} {{season for}} Victoria, Loxton—aged nearly 36—scored 134 and took 2/30 to orchestrate an innings victory over South Australia {{in the second}} match of the summer. In the penultimate match of the season, which effectively determined {{the fate of the}} Sheffield Shield, the Victorian all-rounder took 4/44 to help dismiss New South Wales for 149 and take a 292-run first innings lead. However, the defending champions hung on for a draw to ensure the retention of their title. Loxton then surpassed his previous career <b>best</b> <b>by</b> taking 6/49 against Western Australia to set up a nine-wicket win in the last match of the season.|$|E
5|$|In {{his final}} Jamaican High School Championships, in 2003, he broke both the 200 m and 400 m records with times of 20.25 s and 45.35 s, respectively. Bolt's runs were a {{significant}} improvement upon the previous records, beating the 200 m <b>best</b> <b>by</b> {{more than half a}} second and the 400 m record by almost a second. While Bolt improved upon the 200 m time three months later, setting the still-standing World youth best at the 2003 Pan American Junior Championships. The 400 m time remains No. 6 on the all-time youth list, surpassed only once since, by future Olympic champion Kirani James.|$|E

5|$|John of Antioch and the Patriarch Nikephoros both {{report that}} Heraclius the Elder {{maintained}} correspondence with Priscus, the Count of the Excubitors and former {{commander of the}} army. By that time, Priscus was the son-in-law of Phocas but reportedly held a grudge against the emperor. He allegedly promised Heraclius the Elder support {{in case of a}} rebellion and confirmed it once the rebellion had started. The story is somewhat suspect. While there was major dissension in Constantinople and Priscus did in time defect to Heraclius the Elder, there is nothing to suggest that Priscus helped incite the revolt. Patriarch Nikephoros reports that Heraclius the Elder held council with his brother Gregoras before proclaiming his revolt, possibly indicating that Gregoras was acting as his advisor. He also reports that Gregoras hoped to promote his own son Nicetas to the throne, although this is considered unlikely at <b>best</b> <b>by</b> modern historians.|$|E
5|$|Lysacek {{began the}} 2007–2008 {{season at the}} 2007 Skate America. He underrotated and fell on an {{attempted}} quadruple toe loop-triple toe loop in the short program, receiving only one point for that element. He was in second place going into the free skate. He won the free skate, landing a clean quadruple jump, {{but was unable to}} pull up to first overall, due to Daisuke Takahashi's twelve point lead after the short program. He went on to the 2007 Cup of China, where he won the short program with a score of 81.55, improving his personal <b>best</b> <b>by</b> almost thirteen points. He placed second in the free skate after falling on his quadruple jump, and finished second overall to Johnny Weir.|$|E
5|$|Nurmi {{made his}} {{international}} debut in August at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium. He {{took his first}} medal by finishing second to Frenchman Joseph Guillemot in the 5000 m. This would remain {{the only time that}} Nurmi lost to a non-Finnish runner in the Olympics. He went on to win gold medals in his other three events: the 10,000 m, sprinting past Guillemot on the final curve and improving his personal <b>best</b> <b>by</b> over a minute, the cross country race, beating Sweden's Eric Backman, and the cross country team event where he helped Heikki Liimatainen and Teodor Koskenniemi defeat the British and Swedish teams. Nurmi's success brought electric lighting and running water for his family in Turku. Nurmi, however, was given a scholarship to study at the Teollisuuskoulu industrial school in Helsinki.|$|E

5|$|The 1966 {{legislative}} session {{was much more}} successful for Breathitt. His economic development program, which led to construction or expansion of 749 industries, 57,000 new jobs, and more than $1billion in new plant investment, was recognized as the nation's <b>best</b> <b>by</b> the Society of Industrial Investors in 1964 and generated an additional $100million in state revenue. The pro-administration majority in the legislature was expanded in the 1965 elections, and Waterfield, Breathitt's sometimes hostile lieutenant governor, was stripped of much of his authority. Former governor Lawrence Wetherby was selected president pro tempore of the senate, providing effective leadership in that house of the General Assembly. Wetherby introduced a budget which was 27 percent larger than the previous one and contained appropriations {{for most of the}} state's political districts. Wetherby's leadership was so effective that the budget passed both houses of the Assembly, virtually unchanged, by votes of 99–0 and 31–5 only ten days later.|$|E
5|$|The only {{occasion}} {{on which}} more than one player has taken a five-wicket haul on debut in the same match was during the first women's Test match in December 1934. During this match, three players achieved the feat; Myrtle Maclagan and Mary Spear for England, and Anne Palmer for Australia. Maclagan's bowling figures of seven wickets for 10 runs are the <b>best</b> <b>by</b> any woman on Test debut, {{and is one of}} three occasions on which a player has claimed seven wickets on their women's Test debut, along with Palmer and Lesley Johnston. Betty Wilson, who was the fourth player to take five wickets in an innings on debut, is the only woman to have taken ten wickets in a match on debut. Spear's five wickets for 51 runs was the most economical bowling when taking five wickets, conceding just 0.44 runs per over. Conversely, Shubhangi Kulkarni was the most expensive, allowing 4.11 runs per over. Isobel Joyce bowled the least overs in her innings when taking a five-wicket haul, six wickets for 21 runs from 11.1 overs.|$|E
5|$|Transvaal {{began their}} reply strongly; their openers, Monty Bowden and John Hickson put on 69 {{runs for the}} first wicket, the {{majority}} being scored by Bowden. Once they lost their first wicket, the team continued to lose wickets at regular intervals; the second-highest partnership of the innings was the 17 runs made for the tenth, or last, wicket. George Glover {{was the best of}} the bowlers, collecting six wickets. Glover and Albert Rose-Innes bowled the majority of the overs, and took nine of the wickets between them. Bowden's score of 63 was substantially the <b>best</b> <b>by</b> any batsman in the innings, only John Piton, Spranger Harrison and Hickson scored more than 10 runs, and none managed as many as 20.|$|E
