5|$|The {{first such}} effort, Cosgrove Hall's {{animation}} of The Invasion episodes 1 and 4, was released to DVD alongside the surviving episodes in November 2006. The animation had <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> by an earlier surplus in the Doctor Who website budget, {{allowing it to}} be used in the DVD release as a test for the concept, at no extra cost. Despite the DVD's success, the sales were not high enough to offset the animation cost for any future collaboration.|$|E
5|$|The same update {{released}} {{alongside the}} Fury expansion pack introduced in-game advertisements, {{found in the}} loading screens before a race. This move was met with criticism from gaming news outlets, particularly as the advertisements almost doubled the loading time between levels, and while the game content loads at the same speed, the advert must finish playing before the race can begin. The adverts were removed soon after numerous complaints were made by players. In addition to the load time problems, there had been consternation about advertising being retroactively added into a game that had already <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for.</b>|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Stalinist period, most Soviet {{workers had}} <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> their work {{based on a}} piece-rate system. Thus their {{individual}} wages were directly tied {{to the amount of}} work they produced. This policy was intended to encourage workers to toil and therefore increase production as much as possible. The piece-rate system led to the growth of bureaucracy and contributed to significant inefficiencies in Soviet industry. In addition, factory managers frequently manipulated the personal production quotas given to workers to prevent workers' wages from falling too low.|$|E

5|$|Denis Smith {{brought in}} two strikers who were {{experienced}} in the top division: Southampton's Paul Moody and Nottingham Forest's Nigel Jemson. Oxford finished seventh in 1994–95 season, and in the following season gained promotion by finishing runners-up to rivals Swindon Town, despite not winning an away game {{till the end of}} January. Robin Herd, co-owner of the March Racing Team, took control of the club in 1995. In June of that year, the board of directors unveiled plans for a new 16,000-seat stadium at Minchery Farm, to replace the dilapidated Manor Ground. The club had hoped to move into the new stadium near the Blackbird Leys housing estate by the start of the 1998–99 season, but construction was suspended during the preceding season, because construction company Taylor Woodrow had not <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> the work already undertaken.|$|E
5|$|In January 2014, Elite Systems, who {{produced}} a successful range of {{software for the}} original ZX Spectrum in the 1980s, announced plans for a Spectrum-themed bluetooth keyboard that would attach to mobile devices such as the iPad. The company provided a crowdfunding campaign in order to fund the project, which would be compatible with games already released on iTunes and Google Play. Elite Systems took down its Spectrum Collection application the following month, due to complaints from authors of the original 1980s game software {{that they had not}} <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> the content. Later that year, a £100 Sinclair ZX Spectrum Vega retro video game console was announced by Retro Computers and crowdfunded on IndieGogo, with the apparent backing of Clive Sinclair as an investor, but without a full keyboard and manufactured in a limited capacity.|$|E
5|$|In early 1957, Tubb persuaded Hamilton {{to switch}} the {{magazine}} from pocket-book to digest size format, {{in the hope}} that this would improve the magazine's visibility on bookstalls. The circulation did indeed rise, to about 14,000 copies per month—a surprisingly low figure given Landsborough's assertion that Authentic had been selling 30,000 copies in the early days. However, later that year, Hamilton made the decision to invest a substantial sum in the UK paperback rights of an American best-seller: it is not known for certain which book this was, but it is thought to have been Evan Hunter's The Blackboard Jungle. Hamilton could no longer afford to have cash tied up in Authentic, and in the summer of 1957 Tubb was given two months to close down the magazine, printing stories that had already <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for.</b> The last issue was dated October 1957.|$|E

5|$|In late 2000, Wail {{traveled}} to the United Arab Emirates, where he purchased traveler's checks, presumed to have <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> by Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi. Five other hijackers passed through the United Arab Emirates and purchased traveler's checks, including Majed Moqed, Saeed al-Ghamdi, Hamza al-Ghamdi, Ahmed al-Haznawi and Ahmed al-Nami. The 9/11 Commission believes {{that three of the}} future muscle hijackers, including Wail and Waleed, traveled in a group from Saudi Arabia to Beirut and then onward to Iran where they could travel through to Afghanistan without getting their passports stamped. An associate of a senior Hezbollah operative is thought to have been on the same flight, although this may have been a coincidence.|$|E
5|$|Lathrop House was {{the third}} {{residential}} quadrangle (quad) dormitory built {{on the campus of}} Vassar College in the town of Poughkeepsie, New York. The college built Lathrop during a period of rapid dorm construction spanning 1893–1902 during which the older seminary-style model of housing—a single large hall in which all a college's residents lived, in Vassar's case Main Building—was quickly waning in popularity in favor of smaller individual houses. The project began with the opening of Strong House in 1893 and continued with Raymond House in 1897; Lathrop followed in 1901, and Davison House's erection completed the quad in 1902. Construction of the dorm was paid for with Vassar's funds, unlike Strong House which had <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> by a gift from John D. Rockefeller.|$|E
5|$|On 11 December 1971, {{the bridge}} opened for traffic, {{and on the}} same day, the Alvøy–Brattholmen Ferry was terminated. In February 1972, there were twice as many cars as there {{had been on the}} ferry in February 1971. The {{official}} opening by King Olav V took place on 25 May 1972. The bridge cost NOK39.8 million to construct. This included NOK650,000 for the county road between Knarrevik and Brattholmen, which had <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> by the state. The cost the company had to pay was NOK23.45 million. The final estimates for the project were for NOK34 million, and the whole cost above this was covered by the state. When it opened, the bridge was the longest in Norway.|$|E

5|$|In March 1985, Partnair {{was granted}} {{concession}} for scheduled services from Fornebu via Notodden to Stavanger. The route was started on 15 August using a ten-seat Beechcraft 200 Super King Air and flew twice a day, {{five days a}} week. This route was made possible after an instrument landing system was installed at the airport. The NOK2 million cost had <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> by Norsk Hydro, while Tinfos had paid NOK100,000 for new landing lights. The upgrades also included a new terminal, which included a café in the second story and seating for 14 people. Ticket sales and check-in was managed by NSB Reisebyrå, {{a subsidiary of the}} Norwegian State Railways. After five months, Partnair had lost NOK1.2 million on the route. In average, they were selling three to four tickets per flight to Stavanger, and one to Oslo. From March 1986, the leg from Notodden to Oslo was dropped and the service to Stavanger reduced. However, the route proved unprofitable and was eventually terminated later the same month.|$|E
5|$|On June 15, 1994, the National Basketball Association's {{franchise}} relocation committee {{voted unanimously}} to block {{the sale of the}} franchise to Top Rank resulting in the Timberwolves remaining in Minneapolis through at least the 1994–95 season. Top Rank's offer was rejected by the league due to questions surrounding their financing plan. The $152 million purchase price would have <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> through $40 million from unknown investors; up to $76.25 million in loans from banks that had yet to make commitments; and $50 million or more from undisclosed sources based on projected revenues from the un-built arena in New Orleans. Also, the league filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis seeking an injunction against any transfer of the team from Minnesota. On June 21, 1994, the league officially denied sale of the franchise to Top Rank resulting in the Timberwolves remaining in Minneapolis. On June 28, 1994, Top Rank would file a counter-suit in Louisiana Civil District Court. The suit sought to have ownership fulfill their contractual obligation to sell the team to Top Rank. The following day, federal district court ruled that the franchise was to remain in Minneapolis through June 15, 1995.|$|E
5|$|The Governor of Oklahoma Brad Henry {{declared}} a State of Emergency in 17counties {{and described the}} outbreak as the worst natural disaster he had seen since becoming governor. On February 15, President Obama approved Henry's request for federal assistance in Carter, Logan and Oklahoma counties. A disaster recovery center {{was set up by}} the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on February20. Homeowners were allowed to borrow $200,000 to repair damages to their home or find a temporary or permanent shelter. They were also allowed to borrow up to $40,000 to replace lost property. Businesses were allowed to borrow up to $2million for damage repair, property loss, and economic loss. By February23, about $781,000 had been given in federal grants. On February 25, FEMA approved Governor Henry's request for public assistance in Carter, Coal and Love counties. The estimated cost to clear the 7,000 tons of debris in Lone Grove was placed at $500,000, of which $90,000 has <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> by FEMA. The Department of Homeland Security offered to assist with the reconstruction of homes and businesses and to support those who were left homeless.
