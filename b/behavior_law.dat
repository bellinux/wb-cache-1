25|$|Law is {{a system}} of rules that are created and {{enforced}} through social or governmental institutions to regulate <b>behavior.</b> <b>Law</b> as a system helps regulate and ensure that a community show respect, and equality amongst themselves. State-enforced laws {{can be made by}} a collective legislature or by a single legislator, resulting in statutes, by the executive through decrees and regulations, or established by judges through precedent, normally in common law jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} topological optimization of a structure with frictionless unilateral contact. The boundary conditions (zero displacements, loads) and the geometry of the contact surfaces being known, we {{consider the}} problem of minimization of the compliance of the structure {{in order to maximize}} its global rigidity. Within the assumption of small strains and small displacements, we assume that the available distributed material has a <b>behavior</b> <b>law</b> deriving from a degree 2 positively homogeneous thermodynamical potential. The contact is modeled as an interface on which the tangential component of the stress vector is imposed to zero on both surfaces and with a <b>behavior</b> <b>law</b> relating the normal component of the stress vector to the normal displacement jump with a high/small rigidity in the respective cases of effective contact/noncontact. The contact <b>behavior</b> <b>law</b> is chosen to derive from a degree 2 positively homogeneous potential. The variationnal formulation and the complementary energy theorem are written. With the assumption of the degree 2 homogeneity for each potential, the compliance is equal to the double of the complementary energy. The minimization of the sum of the compliance and a cost term is then put into the form of a double minimization and solved by successive FEM calculations and local minimizations with respect to the design parameters. Numerical examples with the SIMP approach are presented. 2. Keywords: Compliance, topology optimization, unilateral contact, homogeneous potential, nonlinear <b>behavior</b> <b>law...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{finite element}} model has been {{developed}} with Abaqus/Explicit to model the orthogonal cutting of Ti 6 Al 4 V. Experiments were carried out to validate its results. The experimental cutting conditions {{are the same as}} those used in the {{finite element model}}. They lead to the production of a saw-toothed chip, either numerically or experimentally. The comparison of the model results shows that the difference with the experimental RMS cutting force value is quite large (about 40 %). Both chips morphologies are similar although the teeth of the simulated one have smaller valleys and lengths. The numerical model could therefore be improved. The aim {{of this paper is to}} study the influence of the material <b>behavior</b> <b>law</b> and the damage value on the model results, in order to get closer to the experimental results. It shows that the difference between numerical and experimental cutting forces reduces drastically (it becomes of the order of 2 %) for stresses obtained with the modified <b>behavior</b> <b>law</b> similar to those observed in the literature. The teeth of the chip have a larger valley and are therefore closer to the experimental chip. These improvements do not interfere with the physics of the saw-toothed chip formation, which is still the same as the experimental one. An important point is that it turns out that the influence of the material <b>behavior</b> <b>law</b> and of the damage value are almost decoupled within the limits of the variations selected. Indeed, the material <b>behavior</b> <b>law</b> controls the level of the cutting force while the damage value acts mostly on the morphology...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} {{a new approach}} in order to formulate well-posed time-domain damping models able to represent various frequency domain profiles of damping properties. The novelty {{of this approach is}} to represent the <b>behavior</b> <b>law</b> of a given material directly in a discrete-time framework as a digital filter, which is synthesized for each material from a discrete set of frequency-domain data such as complex modulus through an optimization process. A key point is the addition of specific constraints to this process in order to guarantee stability, causality and verification of thermodynamics second law when transposing the resulting discrete-time <b>behavior</b> <b>law</b> into the time domain. Thus, this method offers a framework which is particularly suitable for time-domain simulations in structural dynamics and acoustics {{for a wide range of}} materials (polymers, wood, foam, etc.), allowing to control and even reduce the distortion effects induced by time-discretization schemes on the frequency response of continuous-time behavior laws...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{finite element}} model is {{proposed}} to determine the residual strength {{and the evolution of}} damage area of indented sandwiches structures with Nomex honeycomb core and metallic skins indented by a spherical indenter under longitudinal compression load (CAI). The honeycomb is represented by a grid of non-linear springs which its <b>behavior</b> <b>law</b> is obtained by performing simple transverse uniform compression test on a block of honeycomb alone. The comparisons between computation and test result show that the model can simulate accurately the form of damage geometry during indentation, its residual print when the load is relieved (relaxation) and the residual strength and the evolution of damage geometry during CAI. Introduction. The model used to simulate the behavior of indented sandwich structure under CAI loading is taken from a complete study from [1] and [2].
