40|$|Demosponges {{possess a}} leucon-type canal system which is {{characterized}} by a highly complex network of canal segments and choanocyte chambers. As sponges are sessile filter feeders, their aquiferous system plays an essential role in various fundamental physiological processes. Due to the morphological and architectural complexity of the canal system and the strong interdependence between flow conditions and anatomy, our understanding of fluid dynamics throughout leuconoid systems is patchy. This paper provides comprehensive morphometric data on the general architecture of the canal system, flow measurements and detailed cellular anatomical information to help fill in the gaps. We focus on the functional cellular anatomy of the aquiferous system and discuss all relevant cell types in the context of hydrodynamic and evolutionary constraints. Our analysis is based on the canal system of the tropical demosponge Tethya wilhelma, which we studied using scanning electron microscopy. We found a hitherto undescribed cell type, the reticuloapopylocyte, which is involved in flow regulation in the choanocyte chambers. It has a highly fenestrated, grid-like morphology and covers the apopylar opening. The minute opening of the reticuloapopylocyte occurs in an opened, intermediate and closed state. These states permit a gradual regulation of the total apopylar opening area. In this paper the three states are included in a theoretical study into flow conditions which aims to draw a link between functional cellular anatomy, the hydrodynamic situation and the regular body contractions seen in T. wilhelma. This provides a basis for new hypotheses regarding the function of <b>bypass</b> <b>element...</b>|$|E

In the classical model of flow the aquiferous system consists of incurrent –and excurrent canal system and choanocyte chambers. However, morphological {{studies in the}} last years revealed yet another architectural structure in leucon-type canal systems, the so called <b>bypass</b> <b>elements.</b> These structures lead to a direct connection between incurrent and excurrent canal system elements without passing choanocyte chambers. Due to their interconnected nature they are opening up alternative flow pathways. In order to study the fluid mechanics impact of <b>bypass</b> <b>elements</b> in Tethya wilhelma we investigated internal flow fields and canal system architecture. A virtual 3 D canal system model was developed based on SRµCT data. This model was utilized in FEM flow simulations. In vivo particle tracking velocimetry measurements of oscular outflow velocity served as initial boundary conditions. Microscopic investigations supplemented detailed morphometric information on the cellular level for various elements of the aquiferous system (e. g. apopylar and prosopylar openings). Results of the simulation were verified in an experimental setup making use of a rapid prototype model. Flow trajectories were visualized by high-speed videography. Our preliminary results indicate a recirculation of water within in the canal system. Within the FEM-models {{it was not possible to}} introduce passive flows. The same holds for the developed rapid prototype model. However, principle flow patterns observed in the FEM simulation could be verified. In contrast to a water flow being channeled through <b>bypass</b> <b>elements</b> leading to a reduced flow in the remaining parts of the canal system a recirculation is expected to result in an improved filtering efficiency...|$|R

Due to the extensive use of capacitors both as tuning and RF <b>bypass</b> <b>elements</b> in monolithic integrated circuit (MMIC) design, it becomes increasingly important to accurately predict the performance of such structures in terms of their losses and behavior as lumped elements. Many attempts have been proposed to predict shunt capacitor MIM behavior. However, past models are valid for 20 GHz or less and do not directly correspond to the physical structure of the element. The research presented here attempts to establish a model in which parameters are taken solely from the physical structure of the device or from material properties. Three shunt capacitors of values 0. 024 pF, 0. 18 pF, and 0. 90 pF have been fabricated on 50 [u]m GaAs. S-parameter data has been measured from 0. 5 GHz to 50 GHz and compared against the predicted response of each model. The research reports an evolution of six models, each attempting to incorporate more and more physical features into the mode. The final model, Model 6, has been shown to offer best accuracy of the six developmental models presented in this research. Model 6 incorporates actual physical dimensions into the model including physical gaps and approximating the capacitance with a parallel transmission line model.

By midnight, the two Japanese divisions fired starshells to indicate to their commander that they had secured their initial objectives, and by 01:00they were well established. Over the course of two hours, the three Australian battalions that had been engaged sought to regroup, moving back east from the coast towards the centre of the island. Despite being in contact this was completed mainly in good order. The 2/20th managed to concentrate three of its four companies around the Namazie Estate, although one was left behind; the 2/18th was only able to concentrate half its strength at Ama Keng, while the 2/19th also moved back three companies, leaving a fourth to defend Tengah airfield. Further fighting followed throughout the early morning of 9 February and the Australians were pushed back further, with the 2/18th being pushed out of Ama Keng and the 2/20th being forced to pull back to Bulim, west of Bukit Panjong. Meanwhile, <b>bypassed</b> <b>elements</b> attempted to break-out and fall back to the Tengah airfield to rejoin their units and in doing so received heavy casualties.

It is involved in ingestion, excretion, gas exchange, etc. Our knowledgeincludes general aspects of canal architecture, cellular anatomy and limited models onthe flow generated by choanocytes.

Our study aimed at analyzing thecanal system anatomy of Tethya wilhelma (Demonspongiae, Hadromerida) and atreconstructing the 3 D topology. We used synchrotron radiation based x-ray micro tomography scans (SR-µCT atGKSS/DESY, Hamburg) of canal system corrosion casts and virtual casts to generatehigh resolution 3 D reconstructions of canal system replicates using ImageJ and VGStudioMax. Hierarchical classification of canals and additional morphometric parameterswere calculated using a custom developed software. The 3 D topologies based on micro tomography image stacks were analyzedquantitatively and provided information on canal diameter, length, branching angle andspacing between branches in correlation to a hierarchical classification of canals. Due {{to the presence of}} larger <b>bypass</b> <b>elements</b> forming ring structures in the canals system,hierarchical classification of canals were applied only to a subsets of the data. Betweendifferent hierarchical levels the canal diameter scaled by varying factors. On anorganismic scale the aquiferous system resembles a highly efficient fluid transportsystem offering minimal resistance to flow. We assume that localized flow modificationsby the sponge occur. This is congruent with our 3 D-analysis, which demonstratedalternative flow-pathways on a more global scale. Our high resolution 3 D models ofpartial and entire canal systems are an important step towards the first computationalfluid dynamics models.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} design {{and implementation of the}} file system component of the Saguaro operating system for computers connected by a local-area network. Systems constructed on such an architecture have the potential advantage of increased file availability due to their inherent redundancy. In Saguaro, this advantage is made available through two mechanisms that support semi-automatic file replication and access: reproduction sets and metafiles. A reproduction set is a collection of files that the system attempts to keep identical on a "best effort" basis, relying on the user to handle unusual situations that may arise. A metafile is a special file that contains symbolic path names of other files; when a metafile is opened, the system selects an available constituent file and opens it instead. These mechanisms are especially appropriate for situations that do not require guaranteed consistency or a large number of copies. Other interesting aspects of the Saguaro file system design are also described. The logical file system forms a single tree, yet any file can be placed in any of the physical file systems. This organization allows the creation of a logical association among files that is quite different from their physical association. In addition, the broken path algorithm is described. This algorithm makes it possible to <b>bypass</b> <b>elements</b> in a path name that are on inaccessible physical file systems. Thus, any accessible file can be made available, regardless of the availability of directories in its path. Details are provided on the implementation of the Saguaro file system. The servers of which the system is composed are described individually and a comprehensive operational example is supplied to illustrate their interation. The underlying data structures of the file system are presented. The virtual roots, which contain information used by the broken path algorithm, are the most novel of these. Finally, an implementation of reproduction sets and metafiles for interconnected networks running Berkeley UNIX is described. This implementation demonstrates the broad applicability of these mechanisms. It also provides insight into the way in which mechanisms to facilitate user controlled replication of files can be inexpensively added to existing file systems. Performance measurements for this implementation are also presented...|$|R

This enhancer interference occurred {{at the level of}} enhancer–promoter communication. It occurred only between enhancers on opposite sides of an insulator and depended on enhancer activity.

40|$|Nowadays {{the growing}} {{necessity}} of high calculation speeds {{has taken to}} the computers’s engineers {{to work in the}} field of the massively parallel architectures. These are classified into two categories: multiprocessors and multicomputers. The multicomputers have become the best in the two options due to their excellent scalability. Synthetically the architecture of a multicomputer is composed of several processors (nodes), each one with its local memory, connected to each other through an interconnection network. The communication and synchronization among processes tasks are carried out by means of passing- messages through the interconnection network, so this element becomes a key issue in the determination of the reliability and robustness of these machines. Traditionally, the use of spare elements that allows the reconfiguration of the network and preserve the original topology has been the way to obtain the fault tolerance. An alternative consists on the use of several fault-tolerant routing algorithms that will <b>bypass</b> any faulty <b>element</b> of the network. However these algorithms present a great inconvenience, since their use leads to an important degradation of the performance of the network and, in consequence, of the multicomputer.

In both cases, the Variational Multi Scale (VMS) stabilization technique and, in particular, the Orthogonal Subgrid Scale (OSS) method allows the use of linear/linear interpolations for triangular and tetrahedral <b>elements</b> <b>bypassing</b> the strictness of the inf-sup condition on the choice of the interpolation spaces. These stabilization procedures lead to discrete problems which are fully stable, free of volumetric locking or stress oscillations.; This work exploits the concept of mixed finite element methods to formulate stable displacement/stress/pressure finite elements aimed for the solution of nonlinear problems for both solid and fluid finite element (FE) analyses. The final goal is to design a finite element technology able to tackle simultaneously problems which may involve isochoric behavior (preserve the original volume) of the strain field together with high degree of accuracy of the stress field. These two features are crucial in nonlinear solid and fluid mechanics, as used in most numerical simulations of industrial manufacturing processes.; Numerical benchmarks show that the results obtained compare very favorably with those obtained with the corresponding mixed displacement/pressure formulation.

40|$|What we {{perceive}} to be wilderness is in fact just a product: a physical manifestation of the force of wildness. Attempting to manufacture wilderness while <b>bypassing</b> this primary <b>element</b> (the force of wilderness) is why ‘emulated wilds’ often feel uncanny, fake. This thesis contrasts these forces, necessitating a new negotiation between people and the environment. The Kapiti Coast has seen substantial growth in the last 50 years, resulting in sprawling suburban and commercial development across the region. While areas of landscape close to the historic ecologies of the region remain, much {{of it has been}} lost around the town centre, where development has focused in recent decades. This thesis will explore historic representations of wilderness in picturesque and romanticist painting, drawing on both previous views of the wild, more modern interpretations as well as my own personal perceptions. The aim of this design-led research is to understand how to bring a sense of wilderness back into developed areas of the Kapiti Coast. In order to do this, I will explore how designing using digital painting can create a stronger sensory understanding of wilderness. I will use this medium of digital painting to explore what the picturesque means within the discipline of modern landscape architecture. Within the specific Kapiti Coast context, I will identify the elements of suburbia that are underperforming {{in the context of the}} larger landscape setting and finally establish a scenario-based methodology to explore site-specific definitions of wilderness within Kapiti...|$|R
40|$|Sessile filter feeding animals, {{including}} sponges (Porifera), rely on efficient fluid {{transport systems}} tokeep energy expenditure for water processing low. As {{a consequence of}} the sponge canal systemcomplexity only limited data on flow velocities and transport rates are available. This restricts ourunderstanding of this central anatomical structure and related physiological processes, functionalmorophological principles and ecology. Obtaining experimental measurements from internal parts ofthe canal system is almost impossible for most species. Therefore data are mainly based ontheoretical assumptions. This is linked to the limited availability of detailed morphometric andquantitative data on canal system architecture. Here I discuss experimental and in silico results onflow studies in marine and fresh water sponges. Canal system models based on SR-µCT data allowedfor the setup of finite element models to study flow inside the aquiferous system and the influence ofspecific canal system <b>elements</b> (<b>bypasses</b> and cellular structures). In order to calibrate the model andverify results flow velocity measurements by particle tracking velocimetry have been performed. Observed flow velocities in canal segments of diverse hierarchical orders differ from predictions basedon the classical hierarchical model of flow for sponges which reported much higher and fasterincreasing flow velocities towards the osculum. This is {{a consequence of the}} aquiferous systemarchitecture which displays a compensating increase in available canal volume. With the ability toactively change canal diameters and aperture openings in the canal system sponges are most likelyable to fine tune internal flow velocities and perfusion rates of specific areas of their body...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{technological}} evolution {{involves a}} higher number of physical defects in circuits after manufacturing. One of the future challenge {{is to find a}} way to use a maximum of defected manufactured circuits. In this paper, multiple techniques are proposed to avoid defects in the cluster local interconnect of a SRAM-based Mesh of Clusters FPGA. Using defect tolerance, area and timing metrics, two previous hardware redundancy strategies are evaluated on the Mesh of Clusters architecture : Fine Grain Redundancy (FGR) and Improved Fine Grain Redundancy (IFGR). We show that using these techniques on a cluster of a Mesh of Clusters architecture permits to tolerate 8 times more defects than on an industrial Mesh FPGA with a low area overhead (- 6 % for FGR and 22 % for IFGR) and a low increase of Critical Path Delay (CPD) (6 % for FGR and 2 % for IFGR). We also proposed three new redundancy strategies using spare resources : Distributed Feedbacks (DF) for crossbar down, Adapted Fine Grain Redundancy (AFGR) to avoid defective multiplexers and Upward Redundant Multiplexer (URM) for the crossbar up. Compared to the Mesh of Clusters architecture without defect tolerance techniques, the best trade off between defect tolerance (36. 4 %), area overhead (11. 56 %) and CPD (+ 7. 46 %) is obtained using AFGR. Using the other methods permits to considerably limit the area overhead (10. 4 % with URM) with a lesser number of defective <b>elements</b> <b>bypassed</b> (18 % max) ...|$|R
