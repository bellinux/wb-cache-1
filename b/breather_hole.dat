5000|$|The nib {{usually has}} a {{tapering}} slit cut down its centre, {{to convey the}} ink down the nib by capillary action, {{as well as a}} <b>breather</b> <b>hole</b> of varying shape. The <b>breather</b> <b>hole</b> allows air into the feed, and back up to the sac. The <b>breather</b> <b>hole</b> also acts as a stress relieving point, preventing the nib from cracking longitudinally {{from the end of the}} slit as a result of repeated flexing during use. Adding distance between the <b>breather</b> <b>hole</b> and the nib tip adds elasticity or flexibility to the nib.|$|E
5000|$|The nib {{usually has}} a {{tapering}} slit cut down its centre, {{to convey the}} ink down the nib by capillary action, {{as well as a}} [...] "breather hole" [...] of varying shape [...] The <b>breather</b> <b>hole</b> has no actual function regarding controlling the ink or air flow. Its main function is to provide an endpoint to the nib slit and forestall inaccuracies during nib slit cutting. Adding distance between the <b>breather</b> <b>hole</b> and the nib tip adds elasticity or flexibility to the nib.

50|$|In 1998, the Fireball EL was {{the first}} Fireball drive with an ATA-5 interface. This model had the spiral-shaped <b>breather</b> <b>hole</b> on the top cover. It quadrupled the Fireball SE's cache to 512 KB, while still having a 5400 RPM spindle speed. These drives were {{available}} in 2.5, 5.1, 7.6 and 10.3 GB capacities with up to four platters.|$|E
5000|$|In late 2015 Vurtego's latest pogo stick, the V4, was introduced. The V4 was {{the first}} major {{redesign}} since the V1. The entire design of the V4 was centered around the new Air Piston, which combined the spacer and piston designs from the V1-V3 in order to increase air volume by 10%. This additional air volume creates a smoother, softer bounce that feels very similar to a trampoline. The V4 jumps higher with less effort than its predecessors. In order to reduce friction during the bounce a smaller o-ring seal and new bushing were implemented. A much harder, 90a urethane donut with sound dampening nubs was integrated into the design, and four additional <b>breather</b> <b>holes</b> were added to the cylinder in order to increase the air flow. The stroke was extended by 1" [...] on the V4 and 3" [...] on the V4 Pro, allowing for riders to jump higher without bottoming out the stroke. The last major update was a round Grip Tip, which provides the same amount of surface area no matter what angle a rider lands at. The V4 is offered in white, and the V4 Pro is offered in a bright green.|$|R
2500|$|The HDD's {{spindle system}} relies on air density inside the disk {{enclosure}} {{to support the}} heads at their proper flying height while the disk rotates. HDDs require a certain range of air densities in order to operate properly. The connection to the external environment and density occurs through a small hole in the enclosure (about 0.5mm in breadth), usually with a filter on the inside (the breather filter). If the air density is too low, then {{there is not enough}} lift for the flying head, so the head gets too close to the disk, and there is a risk of head crashes and data loss. Specially manufactured sealed and pressurized disks are needed for reliable high-altitude operation, above about [...] Modern disks include temperature sensors and adjust their operation to the operating environment. <b>Breather</b> <b>holes</b> can be seen on all disk drives â€“ they usually have a sticker next to them, warning the user not to cover the holes. The air inside the operating drive is constantly moving too, being swept in motion by friction with the spinning platters. This air passes through an internal recirculation (or [...] "recirc") filter to remove any leftover contaminants from manufacture, any particles or chemicals that may have somehow entered the enclosure, and any particles or outgassing generated internally in normal operation. Very high humidity present for extended periods of time can corrode the heads and platters.|$|R
40|$|The inner {{surfaces}} of pressure vessels and hot gas ducts of gas-cooled nuclear power stations need internal insulation {{because of the}} high operating pressures and temperatures. They have to protect the pressure bearing walls from high temperatures. In addition, the thermal fluxes of the power stations should be low. Because of the high pressure the insulatiog systems have to be installed an the inner {{surfaces of}} the walls and not an the outer surfaces as in case of conventional stations. Therefore gas movement may occur within the insulation due to the elevated pressures and local axial pressure gradients thus decreasing their effectiveness. Consequently gas movements, e. g. natural or forced convection, must be excluded or reduced in any Gase by means of flow barriers within the insulation. By these means the flow resistance inside the thermal barriers will be increased. In case of rapid depressurization, however, the flow barriers must not hinder the gas to escape easily from the interior. Otherwise the inner parts of the insulation could be damaged by over-pressures. Therefore <b>breather</b> <b>holes</b> are provided. Their diameters must be optimized with respect to the depressurization rates. In the following at first the requirements for duct insulations and some designs will be described. After that test facilities and experimental results including thermal fluxes, effective thermal conductivities, temperatures and pressure loadings will be intensively discussed. As far as available in literature also thermal barriers for pressure vessels and ducts of reactors in Great Britain and France will be described...|$|R
5000|$|In October 1994 {{they issued}} an eight-track {{extended}} play, Boondoggle, {{as one of}} the first by new label, Candle Records. Raggett described it as an [...] "enjoyable romp... with the band again performing like they have a bunch of happy ants in their collective pants... and the group's upbeat and thoroughly enjoyable music galloping along." [...] The tracks were recorded by Dave Nelson in May-June 1994 at his Nelsonics studio in Kew. Guest musicians, generally for one track each, were Bob Donald on voice, cello by Michael Smallwood, lead vocals by Kirsty Stegwazi, <b>Breather</b> <b>Hole</b> on brass, and Tom Jackman on drums (for two tracks).|$|E
40|$|We {{prove the}} most general theorem about {{spectral}} stability of multi-site breathers in the discrete Klein-Gordon equation {{with a small}} coupling constant. In the anti-continuum limit, multi-site breathers represent excited oscillations at different sites of the lattice separated {{by a number of}} "holes" (sites at rest). The theorem describes how the stability or instability of a multi-site breather depends on the phase difference and distance between the excited oscillators. Previously, only multi-site breathers with adjacent excited sites were considered within the first-order perturbation theory. We show that the stability of multi-site <b>breathers</b> with one-site <b>holes</b> change for large-amplitude oscillations in soft nonlinear potentials. We also discover and study a symmetry-breaking (pitchfork) bifurcation of one-site and multi-site breathers in soft quartic potentials near the points of 1 : 3 resonance.
