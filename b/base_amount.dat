25|$|Another {{cause is}} {{the rate at}} which income is taxed coupled with the {{progressivity}} of the tax system. A progressive tax is a tax by which the tax rate increases as the taxable <b>base</b> <b>amount</b> increases. In a progressive tax system, the level of the top tax rate will often have a direct impact on the level of inequality within a society, either increasing it or decreasing it, provided that income does not change {{as a result of the}} change in tax regime. Additionally, steeper tax progressivity applied to social spending can result in a more equal distribution of income across the board. The difference between the Gini index for an income distribution before taxation and the Gini index after taxation is an indicator for the effects of such taxation.|$|E
