25|$|Staff {{turnover}} {{plagued the}} museum in 2011 and 2012. Veteran curator Bob Durden resigned {{in the fall of}} 2011. Laura Cotton was hired in March 2012 as his replacement. Executive Director Kathy Lear resigned effective April 5. Tracy Houck was hired full-time {{as executive director of the}} museum on November 1, 2012. However, the search for a new executive director was not a timely one. Houck took the reins of PGSMA too late for planning for the museum's popular Christmas Collection art show to begin. The event was cancelled for 2012, although Houck pledged to bring it back in 2013. In December 2012, the museum faced a major facility crisis. PGSMA had been aware since early in 2012 that it needed new boilers to replace its two aged heaters. Some fund-raising had already occurred. But on December 30, one of the museum's two boilers failed, and the second boiler came close to failing. PSGMA applied for an emergency grant from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> argued that block-grant support for city-owned buildings operated by nonprofits did not qualify for the block-grant (which was intended to support public agencies only). there was doubt that the museum would receive it.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} {{vehicular}} crossings {{of the lower}} Hudson River. The Holland Tunnel, opened in 1927, is minimally used for public transportation. The George Washington Bridge, opened in 1931, is used by suburban buses to GWB Bus Terminal. Its lower level, opened in 1962, is the last new river crossing. The Lincoln Tunnel, composed of three tubes opened in 1937, 1945 and 1954, {{is one of the}} busiest tunnels in the world. Its eastern terminus is connected via ramps to the Port Authority Bus Terminal, the gateway for most NJT bus traffic entering Manhattan. Despite the Lincoln Tunnel XBL (express bus lane) during the morning peak there are often long delays due to traffic congestion and the limited capacity of the bus terminal for deboarding passengers. The PANYNJ 2007–2016 Capital Plan included a new bus garage in Midtown, so empty buses could avoid unnecessarily returning through the tunnel <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> scrapped this feature in October 2011. More than 6,000 bus trips are made through the tunnel and bus terminal daily. In December 2011, the New Jersey Assembly passed a resolution calling upon the PANYNJ {{to address the issue of}} congestion. In May 2012, the commissioner of NJDOT suggested that some NJT routes could originate/terminate at other Manhattan locations, notably the East Side. The arrangement would require the approval of the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) to use bus stops.|$|E

In a letter to the memorial commission, CFA Secretary Thomas Luebke wrote that [...] "the competition designs appear to proceed from the underlying assumption that the existing park design is a failure, whereas its problems are the direct result of inadequate maintenance. They commented that many features of the park—such as the berms and other topographical elements which help create a sheltered space {{at the center of the}} park and which are eliminated in most of these schemes—are the very characteristics of the design that make the existing park an appropriate setting for a contemplative memorial. Thus, they criticized the competition program for understating the value and importance of the existing park design, and they encouraged conceiving of the project as a new memorial within an existing park." [...] Washington City Paper reporter Kriston Capps noted that [...] "none of the five finalist designs comes close to complying with the wishes of the CFA", but that it was still too early to say if the design process needed to be restarted.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2008, NASA Watch {{revealed}} that the first stage solid rocket of the Ares I could have created high vibrations {{during the first few}} minutes of ascent. The vibrations would have been caused by thrust oscillations inside the first stage. NASA officials had identified the potential problem at the Ares I system design review in late October 2007, stating in a press release that it wanted to solve it by March 2008. NASA admitted that this problem was very severe, rating it four out of five on a risk scale, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> was very confident in solving it. The mitigation approach developed by the Ares engineering team included active and passive vibration damping, adding an active tuned-mass absorber and a passive [...] "compliance structure" [...] – essentially a spring-loaded ring that would have detuned the Ares I stack. NASA also pointed out that, since this would have been a new launch system, like the Apollo or Space Shuttle systems, it was normal for such problems to arise during the development stage. According to NASA, analysis of the data and telemetry from the Ares I-X flight showed that vibrations from thrust oscillation were within the normal range for a Space Shuttle flight.|$|E
2500|$|As World War II ended, Fairless led U.S. Streel through {{yet another}} major steel strike. [...] The United Steelworkers demanded a {{significant}} pay increase {{in order to}} once more bring pay {{in line with the}} heavy inflation brought about by the war. [...] With prices still strictly regulated by the federal government, in November 1945 Fairless refused to grant any pay increase unless the government approved a $2 per ton increase in the price of steel. Secretary of Labor Lewis B. Schwellenbach urged the parties to come to an agreement out of a concern for national security, but Fairless refused without a price increase. Steel industry executives asked the National Labor Relations Board to prevent a strike, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> said it lacked the power. The Office of Price Administration on November 24 declined to permit a price increase, arguing it would violate its price regulations. But the union agreed to a 30-day cooling off period, and on December 31 President Harry S. Truman won agreement from Fairless and Murray to establish a fact-finding board to study the issue. One week later, the president conferred with OPA Administrator Chester Bowles, and Bowles agreed to consider a $2.50 per ton increase in the price of steel. But OPA's fact-finding was nowhere near complete. [...] With the steel strike scheduled to begin on January 13, Truman summoned Fairless and Murray to the White House on January 11. Truman convinced Murray to delay the strike one week, but the two sides were still far apart on the pay rise (Murray demanding 19 cents an hour, and Fairless offering just 15 cents an hour). On January 13, Fairless consulted with other steel industry executives about the talks. The following day, Truman indicated publicly that he would approve a $4 per ton price increase, but only if the two sides came to agreement via collective bargaining on a wage increase. Murray indicated he would accept Truman's offer. But Murray also reportedly said that the steel industry was engaged in a [...] "conspiracy" [...] to destroy the labor movement, a statement which outraged Fairless and led to a breakdown in talks. With no resolution, the strike occurred as scheduled on January 19. [...] Fairless denounced the strike as an attack on the president's wartime reconversion program, industry, and the public good. On January 24, Fairless asked the president to call a national wage and price conference covering all major industries to establish new national wage and price levels. But Truman rejected the plan, and reiterated that his basic proposal from January was the only one he would consider. On January 28, Fairless opened talks with the United Steelworkers. As the strike continued into February 1946 without resolution, Congress began holding hearings on the issue. [...] On February 9, Murray testified that Fairless had offered him a 19 cents per hour wage increase on January 12. Congressional and public opinion turned against Fairless, and on February 15 he and Murray agreed to an 18 cent an hour wage increase.|$|E

Company attorneys also stated that the PCB-contaminated pipes had been replaced in 1976, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>agencies</b> likewise filed suit, asking that the company be ordered to remove the contaminants from the harbor, and to pay a maximum penalty of about $20 million, reflecting a $10,000 fine for each day the PCB sources had been in place.
