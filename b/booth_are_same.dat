5000|$|Token {{issues were}} {{compounded}} when transit riders {{discovered in the}} early 1980s that tokens purchased {{for use in the}} Connecticut Turnpike toll <b>booths</b> <b>were</b> of the <b>same</b> size and weight as New York City subway tokens.

At that time, the MTA was paid 17.5 cents for each of more than two million tokens that had been collected during the three-year [...] "token war".|$|R

Booth, in addition to the above, understands hold and granting in a legal and financial sense as well.|$|R
