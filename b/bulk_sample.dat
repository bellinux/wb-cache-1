25|$|In the 1960s, {{the noble}} gases neon and xenon were {{discovered}} to have unusual isotopic ratios in primitive meteorites. Their origin {{and the type}} of matter that contained them was a mystery. These discoveries were made by vaporizing a <b>bulk</b> <b>sample</b> of a meteorite within a mass spectrometer, an instrument that is able to count the relative abundances of the isotopes of noble gases that are trapped in the meteorite sample. During the 1970s similar mass spectrometers discovered more components of trapped xenon isotopes. Competing speculations about the origins of the xenon isotopic components were advanced, all within the existing paradigm that the variations were created by processes within an initially homogeneous solar gas cloud.|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we have {{investigated}} changes in dielectric properties, electrical conductivity and complex impedance of Fe 2 TiO 5 nanopowder compacts and <b>bulk</b> <b>samples</b> {{as a function}} of elevated temperature (room to 423 K compacts, to 443 K <b>bulk</b> <b>samples),</b> frequency (100 Hz– 1 MHz) and composition (starting molar ratio of Fe 2 O 3 and TiO 2 1 : 1 —PSB 11 and 1 : 1. 5 —PSB 115). XRD, SEM and TEM analysis of PSB 11 and PSB 115 powders obtained by a simple solid state process from starting hematite and anatase nanopowders confirmed the formation of nanostructured orthorhombic pseudobrookite with small amounts of excess hematite and rutile. The dielectric constant decreased with frequency and temperature for both compacts and <b>bulk</b> <b>samples.</b> Higher values were determined for <b>bulk</b> <b>samples</b> also reflecting the influence of sample composition. Change in the dielectric loss also reflected the influence of sample composition showing one maximum at high frequencies for compacts, and two maxima at room temperature for <b>bulk</b> <b>samples.</b> Complex impedance was analyzed using equivalent circuits and showed in the case of compacts the influence of both grain and grain boundary components, while in the case of <b>bulk</b> <b>samples</b> the dominant influence of grain boundaries. The temperature dependence of the determined grain and grain boundary resistance for compacts and grain boundary resistance for <b>bulk</b> <b>samples</b> was analyzed using the adiabatic small polaron hopping model enabling determination of activation energies for conduction, while the temperature dependence of relaxation times enabled determination of activation energies for relaxation. Changes in electrical conductivity for compacts and <b>bulk</b> <b>samples</b> followed Jonscher’s power law. The change of the determined frequency constant with temperature showed that at elevated temperatures the quantum mechanical-tunneling model for the case of small polaron hopping explains the conduction mechanism occurring in both compacts and <b>bulk</b> <b>samples...</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>Bulk</b> <b>samples</b> of {{lanthanum}} polyphosphate were synthesized {{through a}} hydrothermal hot-pressing (HHP) process. In this process, pressing temperature, pressure and volume of water were varied {{in order to}} improve the density and strength of the resulting materials. The strength of the <b>bulk</b> <b>samples</b> was estimated through drilling and ultrasonic treatments. In order to improve the strength of the materials, the use of microwave irradiation was examined. Lanthanum polyphosphate formed porous <b>bulk</b> <b>samples</b> with a filling factor of approximately 70 %, which was calculated from real and theoretical densities. With respect to machinable strength, a drilled hole greater than 7.0 mm in diameter was obtained on some <b>bulk</b> <b>samples,</b> and the diameter of the samples was 14 mm. The HHP process is a useful method for obtaining <b>bulk</b> <b>samples</b> of lanthanum polyphosphate. Bulk lanthanum polyphosphate containing water crumbled easily to a powder form upon ultrasonication. However, these <b>bulk</b> <b>samples</b> retained their shape upon ultrasonication, despite containing water, after exposure to microwave irradiation, and also experienced minimal weight loss. Furthermore, to study the effect of microwave heating, bulk lanthanum orthophosphate, yttrium orthophosphate and polyphosphate were also examined.|$|R

2500|$|In 1991, Gwen Resources Limited {{performed}} a detailed program of diamond drilling, geological mapping, trenching and surveying at Beanland. After {{this work was}} completed, a 3,392 ton <b>bulk</b> <b>sample</b> was taken from an open pit in January 1992 to confirm old assay results on the Beanland Vein. Equipment consisted of a Caterpillar D6, a Gardner-Denver hydraulic track drill and a John Deere backhoe to remove the blasted material. The extracted ore was shipped to the Kerr-Addison Mine mill in Virginiatown for processing. All of the ore was stockpiled in the mill yard rather than being directly dumped into the crusher and therefore directly into the mill. Because the ore was stockpiled, where it froze {{and had to be}} blasted, it was handled twice which put up the costs of the milling. The mill results were not as high as expected. It was discovered that the ore had a higher percentage in silver than gold. The cause of this was probably due to a deposit of silver hidden in the very high erratic values of gold and silver. Such an occurrence is quite common in the Cobalt-Temagami area. Since the <b>bulk</b> <b>sample</b> was taken in January 1992, it was very cold and experienced a lot of dilution of ore due to overload of holes. Because of the cold weather, the test pit had to be [...] wide. Beanland Mine has remained idle since 1992.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of air-drying on the remineralization of demineralized bovine dentine was examined in wet <b>bulk</b> <b>samples,</b> in dried <b>bulk</b> <b>samples</b> {{as well as}} in wet thin sections. <b>Bulk</b> <b>samples</b> of bovine dentine were first demineralized in an acidic gel (pH = 5) at 37 degrees C for 3 weeks. After 24 -hour pre-treatment of either air-drying or immersion in water, the <b>bulk</b> <b>samples</b> were remineralized in a solution containing 1. 5 mM Ca, 0. 9 mM phosphate and 10 ppm F- (pH = 7) at 37 degrees C for 2, 4 or 8 days. Separately thin sections prepared from demineralized bulk dentine were immersed in water for 24 h and were also exposed to the remineralization solution for 2, 4 or 8 days. The results show that air-drying of the <b>bulk</b> <b>samples</b> increased remineralization of dentine considerably; the microradiographic parameters (1 (d), Delta Z and 1 (a)) show that the degree of remineralization ranks: thin wet sections > bulk dried > bulk wet. Especially, the remineralization inside lesions was greatly enhanced in thin sections and dried samples. It is presumed that the increased remineralization in dried samples is caused by a 'sponge effect', in which the remineralization fluid is sucked up in a dried shrunken lesion, resulting in fast and deep penetration of remineralization solution and/or presumably increased nucleation...|$|R

50|$|The test {{involves}} {{introducing a}} sample of the element or compound to a hot, non-luminous flame, and observing the color of the flame that results. The idea of the test is that sample atoms evaporate and since they are hot, they emit light when being in flame. <b>Bulk</b> <b>sample</b> emits light too, but its light is not good for analysis. <b>Bulk</b> <b>sample</b> emits light primarily due to motion of the atoms, therefore its spectrum is broad, consisting of a broad range of colors. Separate atoms of sample present in flame can emit only due to electronic transitions between different atomic energy levels. Those transitions emit light of very specific frequencies, characteristic of chemical element itself. Therefore, the flame gets the color, which is primarily determined by properties of the chemical element of the substance being put into flame. The flame test is a relatively easy experiment to set up, and thus is often demonstrated or carried out in science classes in schools.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{project has been}} focused on the preparation and characterization of Mg(b 1 -xCx) 2 powder and <b>bulk</b> <b>samples</b> using chemical vapour coated boron and silica coated boron by sol-gel method. The chemical vapour deposition of carbon on boron powder was achieved by reacting ethylene gas on high purity nano-sized boron particles (20 - 100 nm diameter) with varying deposition temperatures and partial pressures. Undoped and carbon doped boron was then reacted with magnesium rod to produce both Mg(b 1 -xCx) 2 powder and <b>bulk</b> <b>samples.</b> Transmission electron microscopy showed that the chemical vapour deposition achieved a uniformly thick carbon-rich layer on each particle, regardless of particle size. In addition, the analusis of the diffraction peaks and the characterization of the magnetisation has evidenced the coexistence of phases with different levels of carbon resulting in multiple current paths within the Mg(B 1 -xCx) 2 samples. The study of the preparation process for bulk Mg(B 1 -xCx) 2 samples has evidenced that reducing the difference between the time constant of reaction and the time constant of diffusion is crucial to opbtain well-sintered samples devoid of cracks. Doping with carbon has shown significant improvements in the field dependence of K for the MG(B 1 -xCx) 2 <b>bulk</b> <b>samples</b> reaching values com[parable with the best literature-reported data for <b>bulk</b> <b>samples.</b> However, the K values of the MG(B 1 -xCx) 2 <b>bulk</b> <b>samples</b> were observed to be noticeably lower when compared with the beszt liter 4 arture-reported data for wires and tapes, owing to the greater density achievable in the latter. In contrast to the carbon doping, the coating with silica via sol-gel process was found to impair the in-field Jc properties of Mg(B 1 -xCx) 2 <b>bulk</b> <b>samples,</b> presumably due to the huge amount of silica loaded onto the boron powder and to the formation of carbonate and silicate impuritis within their reacted microstructure. <br/...|$|R
