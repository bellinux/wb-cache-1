40|$|Excerpt] Congress was {{an active}} {{participant}} in the policy responses to the 2007 - 2009 recession and its aftermath and has an ongoing interest in macro-economic conditions. Current macroeconomic concerns include whether the economy is in a sustained recovery, rapidly reducing unemployment, and speeding a return to normal output and employment growth. Faced with fiscal consolidation and limited further impetus from monetary policy, the momentum of the current economic recovery will likely be determined by the strength of spending by the private economy, particularly the strength of consumer spending. In the aftermath of the deep 2007 - 2009 recession, involving a huge loss of net worth and a large increase in the burden of debt, households’ actions to repair their balance sheets is thought by many economists to be a key factor dissipating the strength of consumer spending and, in turn, slowing economy-wide recovery and job creation. Where households currently stand in repairing their balance sheets is likely to have a strong effect on the strength of consumer spending. If substantially complete, it would point to the prospect of stronger consumer spending and increased momentum of the economic recovery; but if substantial wealth building is still needed, it would diminish that prospect. This report begins with a discussion (accompanied by graphics) of the slower than normal pace of the ongoing economic recovery and the likely role in that of weak consumer spending forced by a sharp loss of household net worth during the recession and the subsequent need to rebuild that lost wealth. Next, the report examines (also accompanied by graphics) where <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>repair</b> currently stands, paying particular attention to the composition of assets that have been accumulated and the degree of debt reduction achieved.

The paper considers evidence of <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>repair</b> through debt repayment as well as changes {{in the composition of}} households' balance sheets and/or saving decisions to determine whether households' desire for holding or investing in riskier versus safer assets has changed. The data show relatively small and limited balance sheet adjustment - especially for those households considered the most likely to have been impacted by the economic collapse. The adjustment that did occur typically raised households' liquid asset holdings and/or saving and reduced their risky asset positions (stocks). There is also some evidence of increased nonhousing debt repayment and slower takeup of new nonhousing debt. Overall, the findings are inconsistent with major adjustments occurring in households' balance sheet behavior - especially to the extent where these shifts would have contributed substantially to the sluggish economic recovery...|$|E

The pace of the economic recovery has slowed, stalling progress in <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>repair</b> in many advanced economies.

Overall macroeconomic risks have increased, reflecting a significant rise in sovereign vulnerabilities in advanced economies.

40|$|The {{balance sheet}} {{adjustment}} {{in the household}} sector was a prominent feature of the Great Recession that is widely believed to have held back the cyclical recovery of the US economy. A key question for the US outlook is therefore whether household deleveraging has ended or whether further adjustment is needed. The novelty {{of this paper is}} to estimate a time-varying equilibrium household debt-to-income ratio determined by economic fundamentals to examine this question. The paper uses state-level data for household debt from the FRBNY Consumer Credit Panel over the period 1999 Q 1 - 2012 Q 4 and employs the Pooled Mean Group (PMG) estimator developed by Pesaran, Shin, and Smith (1999), adjusted for cross-section dependence. The results support the view that, despite significant progress in household <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>repair,</b> household deleveraging still had some way to go as of 2012 Q 4, as the actual debt-to-income-ratio continued to exceed its estimated equilibrium. The baseline conclusions are rather robust to a set of alternative specifications. Going forward, our model suggests that part of this debt gap could, however, be closed by improving economic conditions rather than only by further declines in actual debt. Nevertheless, the normalisation of the monetary policy stance may imply challenges for the deleveraging process by reducing the level of sustainable household debt...|$|E

40|$|Provides the Bank 2 ̆ 7 s {{assessment}} of the current condition of the financial system and potential risks to financial stability. Overview The global financial system continues to be buoyed by strong investor risk appetite. International financial markets have been remarkably stable {{for much of the}} past six months, with historically low volatility and ‘search for yield’ behaviour evident in many asset classes amid highly expansionary monetary policy. This environment has supported economic growth and an ongoing improvement in most banking systems. Nonetheless, a significant re{{assessment of}} risk could lead to a sharp repricing of assets, particularly if markets are less liquid than anticipated. Potential triggers for such a reappraisal include revised expectations for monetary policy in advanced economies. Up to this point, however, market prices have reacted remarkably little to credit and geopolitical events that might have been expected to affect investor risk appetite. Risks surrounding European banks and sovereigns have lessened but not disappeared, given the slow growth environment. European banks have made some progress with <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>repair</b> in the lead-up to the release of the European Asset Quality Review, though if the results are unexpectedly negative, it could impede these banks’ ability to raise additional capital. Conditions in many emerging markets have stabilised since early 2014. However, credit and property prices have grown strongly in some emerging economies, including China, which may have made these economies more sensitive to adverse shocks. Financial system stability in Australia is being underpinned by the continued strong financial performance of the banking system. Australian banks have improved their resilience to future shocks by increasing capital ratios, and their profitability remains robust, aided by further declines in bad and doubtful debt charges. They are also benefiting from improved wholesale funding conditions globally. This in turn has put downward pressure on deposit pricing and fostered an environment of stronger price competition in lending. Non-banks are also benefiting from the lower funding costs, with issuance of residential mortgage-backed securities by a wider range of entities (including mortgage originators) picking up and associated spreads narrowing.  ...|$|E
