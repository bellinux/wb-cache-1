5|$|Stephen had to {{intervene}} in the north of England immediately after his coronation. David I of Scotland invaded the north on the news of Henry's death, taking Carlisle, Newcastle and other key strongholds. Northern England was a disputed territory at this time, with the Scottish kings laying a traditional claim to Cumberland, and David also claiming Northumbria <b>by</b> <b>virtue</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> marriage to the daughter of the former Anglo-Saxon earl Waltheof. Stephen rapidly marched north with an army and met David at Durham. An agreement was made under which David would return most of the territory he had taken, with the exception of Carlisle. In return, Stephen confirmed David's son Prince Henry's possessions in England, including the Earldom of Huntingdon.|$|E
5|$|The rebel barons {{responded by}} {{inviting}} the French prince Louis to lead them: Louis had {{a claim to}} the English throne <b>by</b> <b>virtue</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> marriage to Blanche of Castile, a granddaughter of Henry II. Philip may have provided him with private support but refused to openly support Louis, who was excommunicated by Innocent for {{taking part in the}} war against John. Louis' planned arrival in England presented a significant problem for John, as the prince would bring with him naval vessels and siege engines essential to the rebel cause. Once John contained Alexander in Scotland, he marched south to deal with the challenge of the coming invasion.|$|E

5|$|After a long {{absence from}} politics, Marshall {{was called to}} one final act of public service. Upon the death of Martin D. Hardin who had been elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1823 but died before he could take office, Marshall pursued an {{abbreviated}} campaign for the vacant seat and defeated Jeptha Dudley {{by a margin of}} 3 votes. The primary issue of the day was the Old Court – New Court controversy, an attempt by the legislature to abolish the extant Court of Appeals {{and replace it with a}} new court in retaliation for overturning a replevin law passed in a previous legislative session. Marshall enjoyed a higher level of support in this election <b>by</b> <b>virtue</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> support for the Old Court, which was the prevailing sentiment in his district. His actions in the session, however, appear to have been unremarkable, and he did not seek reelection at the end of his term.|$|E

5|$|As a youth, John de la Pole married twice; {{his first}} {{marriage}} was annulled, but his second marriage, to Elizabeth of York, made him the brother-in-law of two kings, Edward IV and Richard III. It brought him eleven children, the eldest of whom, John, would eventually be named heir to Richard III in 1484 and die in battle in the Yorkist cause. John de la Pole, though, generally managed {{to steer clear of}} involvement in the tumultuous events of the Wars of the Roses. Although he was politically aligned to the House of York, <b>by</b> <b>virtue</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> marriage, he avoided participating in the battles of the 1450s, not taking up arms until Edward IV had claimed the throne. De la Pole appears to have spent much of this period, in fact, feuding with his East Anglian neighbours, the Paston family over an inheritance—even interfering in parliamentary elections, for example, in attempt to gain the upper hand.|$|E

5|$|In June 1315, Glarentza was {{captured}} by the Aragonese troops of the infante Ferdinand of Majorca, who claimed the princely title of Achaea for himself <b>by</b> <b>virtue</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> marriage to Isabella of Sabran, granddaughter of William II of Villehardouin. Ferdinand made Glarentza his residence, and soon seized all of Elis, aided by the defection of several Achaean barons dissatisfied with the Principality's rule by the Angevins of Naples. Ferdinand began minting coins with his name—the rarest issues of the Glarentza mint—but his reign was cut short {{with the arrival of}} the legitimate claimants, Matilda of Hainaut and Louis of Burgundy. In the Battle of Manolada, fought to the northeast of Glarentza on 5 July 1316, the Aragonese were defeated and Ferdinand was killed. The remainder of his army fled to Glarentza, and soon handed over the town and the other fortresses they had occupied and departed the Peloponnese, taking the corpse of Ferdinand with them.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the genre}} began, many shows have offered prizes of {{large sums of}} money to contestants; Teddy Nadler set the {{original}} monetary winnings record of $264,000 during his appearance on The $64,000 Challenge in 1957. Nadler was not surpassed until 1980, when Thom McKee won $312,700 on Tic-Tac-Dough. In 1999, John Carpenter won $1,000,000 on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, becoming the first person to win a seven-figure prize on an American game show. Since then, many players have gone on to win that amount and even surpassed it. As of 2015, Brad Rutter is the highest-earning American game show contestant of all time, having accumulated a total of $4,555,102.

5|$|<b>By</b> <b>virtue</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{performances}} {{with the}} Services team and his seniority in Australian cricket, Hassett appeared certain to succeed Bradman as captain; his only rival {{for the position}} was NSW captain Arthur Morris, the third selector during the tour of England. The season, which was purely domestic with no touring Test team, started with Bradman's testimonial match, in which Hassett led a team against the retiring Australian leader. Hassett scored 35 and 102 and the match ended with the scores tied. Bradman's outfit managed to fall short of the victory by the smallest possible margin, ending one run short of their target with one wicket remaining {{at the end of}} the final over. Hassett continued his liking for the Queensland attack, scoring 104 and 205 in Victoria’s two matches against their northern opponents for the year. Victoria did not do so well as a team, winning two and losing one of the six matches in which Hassett played, as New South Wales took the title. The summer finished with Hassett captaining a team against an eleven led by Morris. The match was designated as a trial for the selection of the Australian team to tour South Africa the following summer. Hassett scored 73 and 159 and top-scored in both innings; Morris 66 and 12. However, Hassett’s effort was not enough to stop an eight-wicket defeat after Morris’s men took a 377-run first innings lead. Morris and Hassett were the first and third highest run-scorers for the 1948–49 season. Hassett ended the season with 855 runs at 61.07.|$|E

50|$|<b>By</b> <b>virtue</b> both <b>of</b> <b>his</b> aristocratic {{status and}} his abilities, Orbeliani {{was able to}} resume his {{military}} career and would rise to high positions in the Caucasus Viceroyalty. He, like many other Georgian nobles who years earlier had plotted to overthrow the Russian hegemony, would make peace with the imperial autocracy, a change aided by liberal policies of the Russian viceroy Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov. A typical romanticist and patriot in his poetry, Orbeliani, like his older contemporary, fellow poet and general Alexander Chavchavadze, remained a loyal officer in the imperial service throughout his career.|$|R
5000|$|Burke's {{definition}} of man states: [...] "Man is the symbol-using (symbol-making, symbol-misusing) animal, {{inventor of the}} negative (or moralized by the negative), separated from his natural condition by instruments <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own making, goaded by the spirit of hierarchy (or moved by the sense of order), and rotten with perfection". Essentially, Burke's definition maintains that man is distinct from other creatures <b>by</b> the <b>virtue</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> use <b>of</b> symbols to communicate, <b>his</b> understanding <b>of</b> negation, <b>his</b> separation from nature by his own techniques, his existence in differing social structures, and his goal to become better than he presently is.|$|R
