The ship trembled, the mass of flame swayed as if ready to collapse, and the fore top-gallant-mast fell. It darted down like an arrow of fire, shot under, and instantly leaping up within an oar's-length of the boats, floated quietly, very black on the luminous sea. I hailed the deck again. After some time a man in an unexpectedly cheerful but also muffled tone, as though he had been trying to speak with his mouth shut, informed me, 'Coming directly, sir,' and vanished. For a long time I heard nothing but the whir and roar of the fire. There were also whistling sounds. The boats jumped, tugged at the painters, ran at each other playfully, knocked their sides together, or, do what we would, swung in a bunch against the ship's side. I couldn't stand it any longer, and swarming up a rope, clambered aboard over the stern.|$|R

40|$|Objective - To {{compare the}} use of two {{ophthalmic}} sponges for tear collection in dogs and cats. Animals studied - Ten healthy dogs and 10 healthy cats. Procedures - A strip (4 x 10 mm) of either cellulose or polyvinyl acetal (PVA) sponge was inserted into the ventral fornix of each eye for either 15, 30 or 60 seconds. The wetted strip was placed into a 0. 2 -mL tube that was first punctured at its <b>bottom.</b> <b>Tears</b> were eluted through the drainage hole into a 1. 5 -mL tube via centrifugation. Tear volume absorbed (VA) and tear volume recovered (VR) were calculated as the difference of the post- and pre- collection weight of the 0. 2 -mL tube and 1. 5 -mL tube, respectively. Recovery ratio (RR) was determined as the ratio between VR and VA. Results - Ophthalmic sponges were well tolerated by all subjects. In dogs and cats, median (95 % range) VA, VR and RR were: 44 μL (11 - 106 μL) and 16 μL (2 - 43 μL); 27 μL (1 - 84 μL) and 6 μL (0 - 29 μL); 64 % (7 - 91 %) and 35 % (0 - 86 %), respectively. PVA sponges achieved significantly greater VR in cats and RR in both species. All parameters were significantly greater with a collection time of 60 vs. 30 and 15 seconds. Body weight was associated with VA and VR in dogs but not cats. Conclusions – PVA is better than cellulose for tear collection given its superior recovery. Ophthalmic sponges could facilitate routine analysis of tear fluid in dogs and cats, although further {{studies are needed to}} evaluate the quality of tears obtained with this method...|$|R

40|$|L'acumulation de sédiments dans les retenues de barrages hydro-électriques nécessite de procéder à des opérations régulières de désenvasement indispensables à leur bon fonctionnement. Ces opérations de vidange ont le plus souvent un effet destructeur sur la faune et la flore aquatique. Cet effet destructeur est principalement lié à une {{diminution}} de la concentration en oxygène dissous et une augmentation de la teneur en matières en suspension. La méthodologie présentée a pour but d'estimer préalablement à toute vidange les risques écotoxicologlques correspondant à une telle opération. Elle implique d'une part la description et l'analyse physico-chimique des sédiments en place, d'autre part la mesure en laboratoire de la consommation en oxygène dissous des matériaux remis en suspension au cours du temps. La fiabilité d'une telle procédure a été montrée en particulier à l'occasion de vidanges de retenues situées sur le cours de l'Isère. Le protocole est décrit précisément de façon à pouvoir guider les exploitants de retenues à l'occasion des opérations de vidange qu'ils dirigent. Sediment {{silting up}} in hydroelectric dams Implies regular draining operations {{in order to}} prevent disfunction of the dams. These operations often lead to drastic lethal affects on aquatic fauna and flora. A toxicological study has clearly shown two main factors responsible for acute toxicological effects : dissolved oxygen deficit and suspended solids increase. These effects have been quantified by experimental tests on Brown trout fry (Salmo trutta fario) the results of which are summarized. The second step consisted in the prediction of water quality evolution downstream during dam draining operation, regarding both factors suspected, in order to assess ecotoxicological hazard. The proposed methodology based on a sedimentological study made in Grangent dam, located on river Loire and immediately downstream of St. Etienne urban area, and in St. Hilaire dam situated on the river Isère downstream partIt consists in sampling cored sediments and in measuring dissolved oxygen kinetic by mixing sediments with water In a reactor. The sample conservation as carried out in jar glasses kept at 4 °C. Results are reproducible as long as residual dissolved oxygen concentration is higher than 3 mg/l. If this condition is respected, oxygen consumption is strictly dependent on suspended sediment concentration. An increase in test water temperature makes the oxygen consumption rise. In accordance with these results, recommendations for dissolved oxygen measures are about 5 g/l suspended sediment concentration, with an experimental temperature reaching the temperature observed during dam draining. The variability of the results for different samples depends on the dam studied. Surface tore samples collected in St. Hilaire dam consume dissolved oxygen faster than the same <b>bottom</b> <b>tore</b> samples. However, in Grangent dam, only one surface core sample collected near the dam construction has clearly shown reducing properties. The difference between two dam sediments is very important : Grangent dam sediment have, on average, dissolved oxygen consumption three more times higher than St. Hilaire in the same duration. Taking into account dissolved oxygen kinetics by mixed sediments, and a simple aeration model using water and sediment deposits from downstream dam, may expert both suspended sediment and oxygen consumption evolution. Hazardous mortality of trout fario fry in downstream dam are quickly graphically visualized. Dam draining operator may so assess, for different suspended sediment land the harmful exposition to fish at any distance from it. This knowledge allows him to plan more strictly floodgate working : pointly dissolved oxygen continuous measurement on downstream dam is sufficient to give a mark related to model hazard assessment. The model reliability has been demonstrated by the examination of data collected during St. Hilaire dam draining operation...|$|R

50|$|Commercial fishing today uses {{a variety}} of {{techniques}} for fishing. Fishing rods with baited hooks and fishing lines used in various ways are used for fishing for some particular types of fish. Fishing using nets like cast nets, hand nets, drift nets, gillnets, seine nets, trawl nets, surrounding nets etc. of various sizes and construction as well as longline fishing with hundreds of hooks on a line fishing both for bottom and pelagic fish (near surface fish) are the most common devices used to catch high yields of fish. The crab fisheries uses crab pots baited with dead fish to catch crabs.In some parts of the Pacific Northwest, fishing with baited traps is also common. Common commercial methods for catching shrimp and prawns include bottom trawling, cast nets, seines, shrimp baiting and dip netting. <b>Bottom</b> trawling often <b>tears</b> up the ocean bottom and can be very destructive to all bottom dwelling fish. Trawling involves the use of a system of nets deployed on or near the sea floor. Benthic trawling is towing or dragging a net at the very bottom of the ocean. Demersal trawling is towing a net just above the benthic zone. Midwater trawling (pelagic trawling) is trawling, or net fishing nearer the surface of the ocean.|$|R
50|$|Alicia wakes {{before sunrise}} with two golden feline eyes staring at her. She ignores {{the animal and}} thinks about her friends in the city, as she gets dressed. Max {{knocks on the door}} to tell her Roland has arrived.She joins the boys outside and there is an instant {{connection}} between Roland and Alicia, who are the same age. Knowing there is an extra bike in the garage, Max enjoys the flirtatious scene, and tells Alicia she will have to balance on Roland’s handlebars down to the beach.At the beach, Roland shows them his shack, where he sleeps during the summers. The inside is filled with trinkets and treasures that Roland has recovered from his dives down to the shipwreck just off shore.The boys prepare for their dive and Alicia waits on shore. Max is mesmerized by the experience of the cool water, and the serene silence {{beneath the surface of the}} ocean, but he leaves the deep diving to his friend.Roland discovers some new treasures, while Max observes from a distance, noticing the ship’s name inscribed on the bow, the Orpheus. Through the water, he dimly sees an old, tattered flag ebbing with the current. As it unfurls, horror seizes Max as he recognizes the symbol he had seen in the garden of a six-pointed star enclosed in a circle. He immediately swims back to the beach.When Roland joins the Carver children on the beach, Alicia begins collecting seashells, and once she is out of earshot, Max tells Roland about the symbol and the circus figures.Alicia returns to the boys and begins to ask Roland about his grandfather and the ship. Roland invites them into the cabin and promises to tell them the full story there.Meanwhile, back at the Carver home, we learn that Irina has been hearing voices in the house, and now hears them in her room, much like a whisper in the walls. It seems to be coming from her wardrobe, and as she approaches it, she sees there is a key in the lock. She hurriedly turns it to the locked position, and steps back. The sound continues, and hearing her mother calling her, Irina turns to run from the room. An icy breeze sweeps past her and slams the door shut, and she struggles with the handle, looking over her shoulder. She sees the key slowly turning; the voices become louder, and she hears laughter…Back in Roland’s shack, Roland tells Alicia and Max more about the Orpheus, retelling all that his grandfather, Victor Kray, has told him about the accident, and the events leading up to it.The Orpheus began as a cargo ship with a bad reputation, operated by a corrupt Dutchman who rented the ship out to anyone who would pay, including smugglers and criminals. The Dutchman was also a gambler, and he had accumulated a lot of debt, which made him desperate to gamble more. He lost a big card game to a man named Mr. Cain, who owned a travelling circus, known for employing shady criminals. Knowing the police were closing in on he and his group’s criminal activities, Mr. Cain charged The Dutchman with transporting his evil posse across the Channel on his ship, and the man agreed.Roland’s grandfather had the misfortune of knowing Mr. Cain for some time, and had unfinished business of some sort with him. He did not want Mr. Cain to leave the town without settling things with Victor first, so hearing of his plot to escape the town, he boarded the Orpheus as a stowaway, not even sure what he would do when he confronted Mr. Cain.He wouldn’t have to, as it turned out, as the ship crashed, and Mr. Cain and all of the other passengers on the ship were killed, save Victor, who was spared thanks to the hiding place he had chosen - a lifeboat.But they never found any bodies.Max and Alicia point out that something seemed to be missing from Victor Kray’s story, and Roland agrees…Back at the Carver house, Irina feels her hands go numb, and she continues to fumble with the door, and she watches in horror as the key turns in the lock, finally stops moving, and is then pushed out of the keyhole, falling to the floor. The wardrobe begins to creak open, and Irina tries to scream as a shape emerges from the wardrobe - the cat. She kneels to pick it up, but then notices something behind the cat, deeper in the wardrobe. The cat opens its jaws and hisses at her, then retreats back into the wardrobe, and a giant smile filled with light appears in the darkness with two glowing golden eyes, and all of the voices she has been hearing say “Irina” in unison. Irina screams and throws herself against the bedroom door, which gives away, and she stumbles into the hallway, and hurls herself down the stairs.Downstairs, Andrea Carver has heard her daughter’s scream, and runs to the base of the stairs just in time to see her child tumbling down to the <b>bottom,</b> a <b>tear</b> of blood escaping from her forehead. Mrs. Carver feels her pulse, and finding it is weak, calls the doctor. Holding her unconscious child, she looks up the stairs to see the cat watching her coldly.|$|R
