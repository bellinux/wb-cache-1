But a major thank you is in order for {{everyone}} who's helped me this far. Everyone from Boe and Dre to Jimmy Iovine. All the graphic designers who have made covers, all the fans who uploaded my music, everyone. Thank you. My digital revolution has taken the Galaxy by storm, and I'm proud of it. It's just time to take things to a higher level. Hopefully, yall will support me. I'm not gonna throw the fact you've heard all my secrets for free in your face. But honestly, I would personally appreciate it if you went out and supported whatever I put in stores. More news to come, but once again, no free music indefinitely. Hold your head, kids...|$|E

40|$|Research on {{breaking}} <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> has extensively utilized undergraduates medical students, and physicians. No {{studies have}} examined how, or whether, psychologists are trained to break <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> and their current practice of breaking <b>bad</b> <b>news.</b> The purpose of this mixed method {{study was to explore}} the training and practices of psychologists in breaking <b>bad</b> <b>news.</b> Particular attention <b>was</b> paid to whether theory related to the “MUM effect” could explain the findings, and whether psychologists are being taught practical skills related to breaking <b>bad</b> <b>news.</b> ^ Results suggested that psychologists are more reluctant to break <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> than good news and support the existence of the “MUM” effect in a sample of psychologists. Anxiety was shown to moderate the breaking of <b>bad</b> <b>news,</b> with more anxious respondents being more reluctant, due to their concern for self/other and norms. Half the sample broke <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> at least monthly, indicated that they break diverse types of <b>bad</b> <b>news,</b> and that they received little training in breaking <b>bad</b> <b>news.</b> Psychologists also indicated that breaking <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> <b>was</b> an important skill to have and a need for training in this area. ^ The qualitative portion of the study examined the reluctancy of respondents in more detail. Reluctant respondents most frequently cited concern for self/others, context, and norms as the reasons. In contrast, respondents who were not reluctant to break <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> most frequently cited their concern for the recipient and experience as reasons. Both groups were asked about the positive/negative effects of breaking <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> and most indicated that it leads to intervention (+), positive coping (+), emotional distress (+) and it changes the therapeutic relationship (+ and −). Alternatively, the positive/negative effects of not breaking <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> <b>were</b> that the recipient is better off/keeps them safe (+), endangers the recipient/communicator (−), maintains denial (−), maintains unrealistic expectations (−), and changes the therapeutic relationship (−). Implications and suggestions for training and practices for breaking <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> <b>are</b> discussed. ...|$|R

This study {{explores the}} impact of how <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> <b>was</b> communicated to parents following a diagnosis of stillbirth. Qualitative in-depth {{interviews were conducted with}} 12 mothers and 5 fathers, bereaved following stillbirth at a tertiary maternity hospital where the perinatal mortality rate is 5. 2 / 1000. Data were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. How the diagnosis of stillbirth was communicated had a profound and lasting impact on parents. Dominant superordinate themes were Language used, Sensitivity and Diversionary techniques. Parents recalled in detail where and how <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> <b>was</b> broken and language used. Diversionary techniques created a sense of mistrust especially when parents felt information was being withheld. Bereaved parents valued privacy at the time of diagnosis of stillbirth. This study highlights the importance of language, sensitivity and environment where clinicians can learn from the experiences of bereaved parents who value open, sensitive and honest communication. The results of this study highlight the importance of patient-focused communication training for clinicians...|$|R

A consistent choice of index sets that matter is given by any free ultrafilter U on the natural numbers; these can be characterized as ultrafilters that do not contain any finite sets.

2500|$|After the Obama {{administration}} reduced federal immigration enforcement, Democratic counties {{reduced their}} immigration enforcement more than Republican counties; a paper by a University of Pennsylvania PhD candidate found [...] "that Democratic counties with higher non-citizen population shares saw greater increases in clearance rates, {{a measure of}} policing efficiency, with no increase in crime rates. The results indicate that reducing immigration enforcement did not increase crime and rather led {{to an increase in}} policing efficiency, either because it allowed police to focus efforts on solving more serious crimes or because it elicited greater cooperation of non-citizens with police." [...] A 2003 paper by two Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas economists found [...] "that while the volume of illegal immigration is not related to changes in property-related crime, there is a significant positive correlation with the incidence of violent crime. This is most likely due to extensive smuggling activity along the border. Border enforcement meanwhile is significantly negatively related to crime rates. The <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> that the deterrent effect of the border patrol diminishes over this time period, and the net impact of more enforcement on border crime since the late 1990s is zero." ...|$|E
40|$|Lack of {{knowledge}} on scientific behaving with patients during giving <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> involves most of physicians even experienced physicians. Interestingly, this hurts physicians mind {{and in some}} cases causes sadness and depression or reaction on dealing with patient. In a cross sectional-descriptive study, 203 clinical assistant were included in study from 2009 to 2010 at Tabriz university of medical sciences. Comments of residents about giving <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> <b>were</b> registered on valid and reliable questionnaire. State of awareness by considering positive answers of statistical population were categorized into three groups; first group: weak awareness (true questions fewer than 50 %), second group: medium awareness (true questions between 50 to 75 %), and third group: good awareness (true questions more than 75 %). Validity of questionnaire was assessed by evaluating contents and reliability using Cronbach's alpha. Stratified sampling was used based on academic year. Mean age of residents was 32. 01 ± 3. 25 years between the ranges of 26 to 43 years. Females were 76 individuals (37. 4 %) and 127 individuals (62. 6 %) males. Mean of physicians work experience was 2. 1 - 2. 9 (0 - 15 years range) at general period. Among residents, internal medicine residents agree on considering patients education before giving <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> much than other majors residents (P= 0. 004). Mean score for residents' awareness about patients' right for knowing disease were 4. 81 ± 1. 58 (min= 0, max= 7); the mean for female residents was 4. 9 ± 1. 49 and 4. 75 ± 1. 64 for male residents. There is statistically significant differences between majors.

By April 1965, Time featured the Peanuts gang on its magazine cover, perhaps prompting a call from John Allen of the New York-based McCann Erickson Agency. Mendelson imagined he would sell his documentary, and blindly agreed to Allen's proposal: an animated half-hour Peanuts Christmas special. The Coca-Cola Company was looking for a special for advertising during the holiday season. [...] "The <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> that today is Wednesday and they'll need an outline in Atlanta by Monday," [...] Allen remarked to Mendelson. He quickly contacted Schulz, and the duo got to work with plans for a Peanuts Christmas special. The duo prepared an outline for the Coca-Cola executives in less than one day, and Mendelson would later recall that the bulk of ideas came from Schulz, whose [...] "ideas flowed nonstop." [...] According to Mendelson, their pitch to Coca-Cola consisted of [...] "winter scenes, a school play, a scene to be read from the Bible, and a sound track combining jazz and traditional music."

The <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> that the book leaves out much that it ought to include and includes some that it ought to leave out." [...] As {{an example of what}} he felt should have been included, Cooper notes [...] "In spite of the book’s strength in depicting Wilson’s family life, it is also oddly unsatisfactory about one of its most important figures: his father." [...] As another example, Cooper states that [...] "Equally glaring is the lack of attention to Wilson’s thought." [...] Cooper questions Berg's inclusion of the memories of Wilson wife by saying [...] "Kristie Miller’s excellent biography of Wilson’s two wives could have raised red flags about Edith’s memory." [...] Cooper not only disputes Berg's framing of Wilson's racism but also his religious perspective, calling into question the use of Bible quotations {{at the beginning of each}} chapter: [...] "Other reviewers have found this practice tiresome; I found it unenlightening and strange." [...] Cooper ends by saying [...] "To sum up, this biography has much to recommend it, especially the pleasure it affords in reading it. Its shortcomings make it far from balanced or comprehensive, much less “definitive." ...|$|E

60|$|Persons {{suffering}} from excessive grief often seek relief by violent and almost frantic movements, {{as described in}} a former chapter; but when their suffering is somewhat mitigated, yet prolonged, they no longer wish for action, but remain motionless and passive, or may occasionally rock themselves to and fro. The circulation becomes languid; the face pale; the muscles flaccid; the eyelids droop; the head hangs on the contracted chest; the lips, checks, and lower jaw all sink downwards from their own weight. Hence all the features are lengthened; and {{the face of a}} person who hears <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> <b>is</b> said to fall. A party of natives in Tierra del Fuego endeavoured to explain to us that their friend, the captain of a sealing vessel, was out of spirits, by pulling down their cheeks with both hands, so as to make their faces as long as possible. Mr. Bunnet informs me that the Australian aborigines when out of spirits have a chop-fallen appearance. After prolonged suffering the eyes become dull and lack expression, and are often slightly suffused with tears. The eyebrows not rarely are rendered oblique, which is due to their inner ends being raised. This produces peculiarly-formed wrinkles on the forehead, which are very different from those of a simple frown; though in some cases a frown alone may be present. The corners of the mouth are drawn downwards, which is so universally recognized as a sign of being out of spirits, that it is almost proverbial.|$|E
