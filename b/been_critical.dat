These <b>critical</b> characteristics <b>are</b> electron flux, electromagnetic radiation, vacuum, and temperature. The electron flux <b>is</b> <b>critical</b> because the solar winds through space bombard spacecraft. The electromagnetic radiation has many critical aspects in itself. As {{can be seen in}} figure 10, the sun has a very broad range covering from the Visual/Infrared to Ultra Violet, specifically the Hydrogen Lyman Alpha emission at 121. 6 nm. A vacuum simulation <b>is</b> <b>critical</b> because space <b>is</b> a vacuum, meaning very few particles. The temperature <b>is</b> <b>critical</b> becaus...|$|R

5|$|Senator Powell favored Kentucky's {{neutrality}} policy {{during the}} Civil War, but nationally, the conflict {{put him in}} a tenuous political situation. On one hand, he favored a strong national government and a strict interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. On the other hand, he was an opponent of coercion, and due to Kentucky's proximity to the Southern states, maintained a more sympathetic view of the southern cause than legislators from more northern states. During his term as governor, Powell had <b>been</b> <b>critical</b> of Northern states that refused to abide by the Fugitive Slave Act.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} end of the 2002–03 season, Goater {{announced}} his intention to leave Manchester City when the season finished in order to seek regular first team football. In his final match for Manchester City, he was asked to captain the side in Manchester City's final game at Maine Road. In total, Goater scored 103 goals in 212 appearances for Manchester City. Since ending his footballing career, Goater has <b>been</b> <b>critical</b> of both Kevin Keegan, who he claims never praised him and Nicolas Anelka, who he feels wanted to be 'the daddy' of Manchester City.|$|E

One reviewer said that Merchants of Doubt is exhaustively researched and documented, and {{may be one of}} the most important books of 2010. Another reviewer saw the book as his choice for best science book of the year. It was made into a film, Merchants of Doubt, directed by Robert Kenner, released in 2014.|$|E
5|$|The Quatermass Experiment (1953) and Quatermass II (1955), both {{written by}} Nigel Kneale, had <b>been</b> <b>critical</b> and popular successes for the BBC, and in early 1957 the {{corporation}} decided to commission a third serial. Kneale {{had left the}} BBC shortly before, but was hired to write the new scripts on a freelance basis.|$|E
5|$|Evans became {{embroiled in}} several {{internal}} Klan conflicts that gained media exposure. In January 1921, {{he and a}} group of grand dragons expelled the publicist Clarke, who had <b>been</b> <b>critical</b> of Evans' efforts to involve the Klan in electoral politics. Evans also clashed with Henry Grady, a judge from North Carolina who served in the Klan from 1922 to 1927, reaching the rank of Grand Dragon. Before Evans gained control of the Klan, Grady had been considered a potential successor to Simmons. After Grady dismissed a Klan-backed law that would have banned the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic fraternal service organization, Evans revoked his membership. Grady subsequently leaked his correspondence with Evans to the media.|$|E

5|$|Jerry McAfee {{served as}} {{president}} of the Minneapolis chapter of the NAACP until 2015, at which point Levy-Pounds decided to run. She won the election unopposed on the ballot but faced criticism from McAfee who contended that she was too focused on issues of police brutality to the neglect of concerns such as crime perpetrated against African Americans by African Americans. Levy-Pounds stated that she hoped to increase youth engagement with the NAACP during her term with the organization. She has <b>been</b> <b>critical</b> of racial disparities in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul region, citing them as some of the nation's worst.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur {{was annoyed}} {{at the way}} that Royle, a Royal Navy officer, communicated {{directly}} with the Admiralty; he was also aware that Royle had <b>been</b> <b>critical</b> of SWPA's command arrangements, and {{of some of his}} decisions. MacArthur proposed that an Australian officer, Captain John Collins, replace Royle as CNS, an appointment that Carpender also supported. Over the Admiralty's objections, Curtin appointed Collins to replace Crutchley as Commander, Task Force 44, in June 1944, at the rank of commodore, with the intention that Collins would replace Royle when his term expired. This did not occur, because Collins was seriously wounded in Leyte Gulf on 21 October 1944.|$|E
5|$|The Sex Party was {{registered}} with Elections BC in March 2005 with its founder, John Ince, also {{acting as the}} party leader. Ince was a Vancouver lawyer, author and co-owner of a store that hosted educational seminars and artistic shows about human sexuality, as well as selling sex-themed merchandise. He had <b>been</b> <b>critical</b> of government laws that perpetuated or resulted in harmful attitudes towards sex-related issues. Ince previously authored a non-fiction book, The Politics of Lust, which addresses the impact of antisexual attitudes or erotophobia on a society's political organization. The party launched its election platform and candidates {{at a press conference}} at the Vancouver Public Library in April.|$|E

Some authors <b>were</b> <b>critical</b> of how the gay rights movement was trying to achieve its goals, some <b>were</b> <b>critical</b> of certain goals such as hate crime laws, and others <b>were</b> <b>critical</b> of both the ends and the means.|$|R
5|$|Tim Waterstone and James Daunt have <b>been</b> <b>critical</b> of tax {{avoidance}} by Amazon.com in the British press. Amazon has received sustained scrutiny {{for the amount}} of its overall sales that are reported by its UK subsidiary, in comparison to those 'processed offshore in Luxembourg to avoid UK tax'. In the 2012-13 financial year, Amazon paid £3.2 million in tax on sales of £4.2 billion and received £2.5 million in grants from the government. In the same period, it was revealed that Waterstones paid £11.9 million in tax, despite an operating loss of £25.4 million and sales of £410.4 million.|$|E
5|$|Who's Your City? was {{intended}} to be a self-help book, based on scholarly research and an academic theory, that provided a reader the mental framework necessary to match their personality and life situation with the optimum city to reside. Florida drew upon his past research on the geographical aspects of wealth generation and locational decisions of members of the creative class, as well as theories and opinions of other academics, like Jane Jacobs, and even those who have <b>been</b> <b>critical</b> of Florida's work, like Tim Harford. New research included a psychological aspect to his theory. Maps, graphs, tables, and indices illustrate the text.|$|E
5|$|Windows 10 {{received}} mostly positive reviews {{upon its}} original release in July 2015; critics praised Microsoft's decision {{to provide a}} desktop-oriented interface in line with previous versions of Windows, contrasting the tablet-oriented approach of 8, although Windows 10's touch-oriented user interface mode was panned for containing regressions upon the touch-oriented interface of Windows 8. Critics also praised the improvements to Windows 10's bundled software over Windows 8.1, Xbox Live integration, {{as well as the}} functionality and capabilities of Cortana personal assistant and the replacement of Internet Explorer with Microsoft Edge. However, media outlets have <b>been</b> <b>critical</b> of changes to operating system behaviors, including mandatory update installation, privacy concerns over data collection performed by the OS for Microsoft and its partners, and the adware-like tactics used to promote the operating system on its release.|$|E

5|$|After a hotel {{housing the}} {{remaining}} foreign nationals was attacked, Penfold organised a further evacuation, which {{was conducted by}} an American warship. The ship transported the evacuees—including Penfold—to Conakry in neighbouring Guinea. While in Conakry, Penfold advised Kabbah on re-establishing his government in exile, and leased a disused restaurant for the government's headquarters. Kabbah was restored in February 1998, but {{the role of the}} private military company Sandline International in assisting Kabbah created controversy in the United Kingdom, as its services were alleged to violate an arms embargo on Sierra Leone. After an HM Customs investigation, a parliamentary inquiry, and a select committee investigation, Penfold was reprimanded but allowed to return to his post. Later in the year, violence began to intensify again in Sierra Leone, and Penfold was ordered to evacuate foreign nationals (the eight evacuation of his career and the second in Sierra Leone) over Christmas 1998. He requested an extension to his term as high commissioner, but the request was denied and he left Sierra Leone in April 2000. He spent {{the last year of his}} career working for the Department for International Development and retired in 2001. In retirement, Penfold has spoken on issues concerning Africa, particularly Sierra Leone, and has <b>been</b> <b>critical</b> of the FCO. His support of Kabbah, and his role in returning him to power in 1998, earned Penfold folk hero status in Sierra Leone.|$|E
5|$|Support for Liddell's story {{came from}} Cecil Williamson, {{founder of the}} Museum of Witchcraft, {{who claimed to have}} known about Pickingill through his acquaintances with both Crowley and Gardner. However, Williamson was an {{unreliable}} source, and was known to repeatedly fabricate claims regarding past events. Another figure, known only as Colonel Lawrence, also supported Liddell's story, asserting that his own great-grandmother had studied under Pickingill and thus had been introduced to Crowley; as with Williamson's, however, Lawrence's claims are unreliable, particularly as he has made the unsupported claim that his great-grandmother studied witchcraft under the American folklorist Charles Leland. Also supporting Liddell's claims was the Wiccan Ralph Harvey, who, following the publication of Liddell's material, publicly declared that in the 1950s or 1960s he had been initiated into one of Pickingill's Nine Covens, located in Storrington, Sussex. Following the publication of Liddell's claims, a number of covens appeared in both the United States and Australia claiming to be practitioners of a tradition originating with Pickingill. Liddell himself has <b>been</b> <b>critical</b> of such groups, expressing his regret that the material he published led to their formation.|$|E
