25|$|Boric acid, {{also called}} {{hydrogen}} borate, <b>boracic</b> <b>acid,</b> orthoboric acid and , is a weak, monobasic Lewis acid of boron, {{which is often}} used as an antiseptic, insecticide, flame retardant, neutron absorber, or precursor to other chemical compounds. It has the chemical formula H3BO3 (sometimes written B(OH)3), and exists {{in the form of}} colorless crystals or a white powder that dissolves in water. When occurring as a mineral, it is called sassolite.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{heating process}} can be {{repeated}} three to four times, even applying different mixtures. When jewelry containing rubies is heated (for repairs) {{it should not be}} coated with <b>boracic</b> <b>acid</b> or any other substance, as this can etch the surface; it {{does not have to be}} [...] "protected" [...] like a diamond.|$|E
6000|$|... 780. The {{production}} of boron from fused borax (402. 417.) {{is also a}} case of secondary action; for <b>boracic</b> <b>acid</b> is not decomposable by electricity (408.), {{and it was the}} sodium evolved at the cathode which, re-acting on the <b>boracic</b> <b>acid</b> around it, took oxygen from it and set boron free in the experiments formerly described.|$|E
6000|$|... 675. Amongst {{powerful}} compounds {{which are}} not decomposed, <b>boracic</b> <b>acids</b> stand prominent (408.). Then again, the iodide of sulphur, and the chlorides of sulphur, phosphorus, and carbon, are not decomposable under common circumstances, though their elements are of a nature which {{would lead to a}} contrary expectation. Chloride of antimony (402. 690.), the hydro-carbons, acetic acid, ammonia, and many other bodies undecomposable by the voltaic pile, would seem to be formed by an affinity sufficiently strong to indicate that the elements were so far contrasted in their nature as to sanction the expectation that, the pile would separate them, especially as in some cases of mere solution (530. 544.), where the affinity must by comparison be very weak, separation takes place[A].|$|R
6000|$|... 1355. Another {{point is}} the {{facilitation}} of electrolytic conducting power or discharge {{by the addition of}} substances to the dielectric employed. This effect is strikingly shown where water is the body whose qualities are improved, but, as yet, no general law governing all the phenomena has been detected. Thus some acids, as the sulphuric, phosphoric, oxalic, and nitric, increase the power of water enormously; whilst others, as the tartaric and citric acids, give but little power; and others, again, as the acetic and <b>boracic</b> <b>acids,</b> do not produce a change sensible to the voltameter (739.). Ammonia produces no effect, but its carbonate does. The caustic alkalies and their carbonates produce a fair effect. Sulphate of soda, nitre (753.), and many soluble salts produce much effect. Percyanide of mercury and corrosive sublimate produce no effect; nor does iodine, gum, or sugar, the test being a voltameter. In many cases the added substance is acted on either directly or indirectly, and then the phenomena are more complicated; such substances are muriatic acid (758.), the soluble protochlorides (766.), and iodides (769.), nitric acid (752.), &c. In other cases the substance added is not, when alone, subject to or a conductor of the powers of the voltaic battery, and yet both gives and receives power when associated with water. M. de la Rive has pointed this result out in sulphurous acid[A], iodine and bromine[B]; the chloride of arsenic produces the same effect. A far more striking case, however, is presented by that very influential body sulphuric acid (681.): and probably phosphoric acid also is in the same peculiar relation.|$|R
2500|$|Boric acid {{can be used}} as an {{antiseptic}} {{for minor}} burns or cuts and is sometimes used in salves and dressings, such as <b>boracic</b> lint. Boric <b>acid</b> is applied in a very dilute solution as an eye wash. Dilute boric acid {{can be used as}} a vaginal douche to treat bacterial vaginosis due to excessive alkalinity, as well as candidiasis due to non-albicans candida. As an antibacterial compound, boric acid can also be used as an acne treatment. It is also used as prevention of athlete's foot, by inserting powder in the socks or stockings, and in alcohol solution can be used to treat some kinds of [...] (ear infection) in both humans and animals. The preservative in urine sample bottles in the UK is boric acid.|$|R
6000|$|... 834. ix. Compound ions are not {{necessarily}} composed of electro-chemical equivalents of simple ions. For instance, sulphuric acid, <b>boracic</b> <b>acid,</b> phosphoric acid, are ions, but not electrolytes, i.e. not composed of electro-chemical equivalents of simple ions.|$|E
6000|$|... 700. Then a biborate of soda was prepared; and this, I think, is an unobjectionable case. The salt, when fused, conducted, and was decomposed, and gas {{appeared}} at both electrodes: {{even when the}} <b>boracic</b> <b>acid</b> was increased to three proportionals, the same effect took place.|$|E
6000|$|... 408. <b>Boracic</b> <b>acid</b> {{was raised}} to the highest {{possible}} temperature by an oxy-hydrogen flame (401.), yet it gained no conducting powers sufficient to affect the galvanometer, and underwent no apparent voltaic decomposition. It seemed to be quite as bad a conductor as air. Green bottle-glass, heated in the same manner, did not gain conducting power sensible to the galvanometer. Flint glass, when highly heated, did conduct a little and decompose; and as the proportion of potash or oxide of lead was increased in the glass, the effects were more powerful. Those glasses, consisting of <b>boracic</b> <b>acid</b> on the one hand, and oxide of lead or potassa on the other, show the assumption of conducting power upon fusion and the accompanying decomposition very well.|$|E

6000|$|... 686. That these {{mineral acids}} should confer {{facility}} of conduction and decomposition on water, {{is no proof}} that they are competent to favour and suffer these actions in themselves. <b>Boracic</b> <b>acid</b> does the same thing, though not decomposable. M. de la Rive {{has pointed out that}} chlorine has this power also; but being to us an elementary substance, it cannot be due to its capability of suffering decomposition.|$|E
6000|$|... 697. Upon the whole, {{it appears}} {{probable}} {{that all those}} binary compounds of elementary bodies which are capable of being electrolyzed when fluid, but not whilst solid, {{according to the law}} of liquido-conduction (394.), consist of single proportionals of their elementary principles; and it may be because of their departure from this simplicity of composition, that <b>boracic</b> <b>acid,</b> ammonia, perchlorides, periodides, and many other direct compounds of elements, are indecomposable.|$|E
6000|$|... 831. vi. A body not decomposable when alone, as <b>boracic</b> <b>acid,</b> is not {{directly}} decomposable by the electric current when in combination (780.). It may act as an ion going wholly to the anode or cathode, but does not yield up its elements, except occasionally by a secondary action. Perhaps it is superfluous for me {{to point out that}} this proposition has no relation to such cases as that of water, which, by the presence of other bodies, is rendered a better conductor of electricity, and therefore is more freely decomposed.|$|E
6000|$|... 799. In one {{experiment}} of {{this kind}} I used borate of lead (408. 673.). It evolves lead, {{under the influence of}} the electric current, at the anode, and oxygen at the cathode; and as the <b>boracic</b> <b>acid</b> is not either directly (408.) or incidentally decomposed during the operation, I expected a result dependent on the oxide of lead. The borate is not so violent a flux as the oxide, but it requires a higher temperature to make it quite liquid; and if not very hot, the bubbles of oxygen cling to the positive electrode, and retard the transfer of electricity. The number for lead came out 101.29, which is so near to 103.5 as to show that the action of the current had been definite.|$|E
6000|$|... 664. I {{shall have}} {{occasion}} in these Researches, also, to class bodies together according to certain relations derived from their electrical actions (822.); and wishing to express those relations without {{at the same}} time involving the expression of any hypothetical views, I intend using the following names and terms. Many bodies are decomposed directly by the electric current, their elements being set free; these I propose to call electrolytes.[A] Water, therefore, is an electrolyte. The bodies which, like nitric or sulphuric acids, are decomposed in a secondary manner (752. 757.), are not included under this term. Then for electro-chemically decomposed, I shall often use the term electrolyzed, derived in the same way, and implying that the body spoken of is separated into its components under the influence of electricity: it is analogous in its sense and sound to analyse, which is derived in a similar manner. The term electrolytical will be understood at once: muriatic acid is electrolytical, <b>boracic</b> <b>acid</b> is not.|$|E
60|$|L. A {{little of}} {{everything}} there's always flint and clay, and magnesia in it, {{and the black}} is iron, according to its fancy, and there's <b>boracic</b> <b>acid</b> {{if you know what}} that is and if you don't, I cannot tell you today, and it doesn't signify and there's potash, and soda, and, on the whole, the chemistry of it is more like a mediaeval doctor's prescription, than the making of a respectable mineral but it may, perhaps, be owing to the strange complexity of its make, that it has a notable habit which makes it, to me one of the most interesting of minerals. You see these two crystals are broken right across, in many places, just as if they had been shafts of black marble fallen from a ruinous temple, and here they lie, imbedded in white quartz, fragment succeeding fragment keeping the line of the original crystal, while the quartz fills up the intervening spaces Now tourmaline has a trick of doing this, more than any other mineral I know here is another bit which I picked up on the glacier of Macugnaga; it is broken, like a pillar built of very flat broad stones, into about thirty joints, and all these are heaved and warped away from each other sideways, almost into a line of steps, and then all is tilled up with quartz paste. And here, lastly is a green Indian piece, in which the pillar is first disjointed, and then wrung round into the shape of an S.|$|E
60|$|Also, {{during the}} attack of fever, Charmian {{developed}} a Solomon sore. It {{was the last}} straw. Every one on the Snark had been afflicted except her. I had thought that I {{was going to lose}} my foot at the ankle by one exceptionally malignant boring ulcer. Henry and Tehei, the Tahitian sailors, had had numbers of them. Wada had been able to count his by the score. Nakata had had single ones three inches in length. Martin had been quite certain that necrosis of his shinbone had set in from the roots of the amazing colony he elected to cultivate in that locality. But Charmian had escaped. Out of her long immunity had been bred contempt for the rest of us. Her ego was flattered {{to such an extent that}} one day she shyly informed me that it was all a matter of pureness of blood. Since all the rest of us cultivated the sores, and since she did not--well, anyway, hers was the size of a silver dollar, and the pureness of her blood enabled her to cure it after several weeks of strenuous nursing. She pins her faith to corrosive sublimate. Martin swears by iodoform. Henry uses lime-juice undiluted. And I believe that when corrosive sublimate is slow in taking hold, alternate dressings of peroxide of hydrogen are just the thing. There are white men in the Solomons who stake all upon <b>boracic</b> <b>acid,</b> and others who are prejudiced in favour of lysol. I also have the weakness of a panacea. It is California. I defy any man to get a Solomon Island sore in California.|$|E
60|$|The Snark {{has been}} a {{hospital}} for months, and I confess that we are getting used to it. At Meringe Lagoon, where we careened and cleaned the Snark's copper, {{there were times when}} only one man of us was able to go into the water, while the three white men on the plantation ashore were all down with fever. At the moment of writing this we are lost at sea somewhere northeast of Ysabel and trying vainly to find Lord Howe Island, which is an atoll that cannot be sighted unless one is on top of it. The chronometer has gone wrong. The sun does not shine anyway, nor can I get a star observation at night, and we have had nothing but squalls and rain for days and days. The cook is gone. Nakata, who has been trying to be both cook and cabin boy, is down on his back with fever. Martin is just up from fever, and going down again. Charmian, whose fever has become periodical, is looking up in her date book to find when the next attack will be. Henry has begun to eat quinine in an expectant mood. And, since my attacks hit me with the suddenness of bludgeon-blows I do not know from moment to moment when I shall be brought down. By a mistake we gave our last flour away to some white men who did not have any flour. We don't know when we'll make land. Our Solomon sores are worse than ever, and more numerous. The corrosive sublimate was accidentally left ashore at Penduffryn; the peroxide of hydrogen is exhausted; and I am experimenting with <b>boracic</b> <b>acid,</b> lysol, and antiphlogystine. At any rate, if I fail in becoming a reputable M.D., it won't be from lack of practice.|$|E
