5|$|Wolves in Japan became extinct {{during the}} Meiji {{restoration}} period, an extermination known as ōkami no kujo. The wolf was deemed {{a threat to}} ranching, which the Meiji government promoted at the time, and targeted via a <b>bounty</b> <b>system</b> and a direct chemical extermination campaign inspired by the similar contemporary American campaign. The last Japanese wolf was a male killed on January 23, 1905 near Washikaguchi (now called Higashi Yoshiro). The now extinct Japanese wolves were descended from large Siberian wolves, which colonized the Korean Peninsula and Japan, before it separated from mainland Asia, 20,000 years ago during the Pleistocene. During the Holocene, the Tsugaru Strait widened and isolated Honshu from Hokkaidō, thus causing climatic changes leading to the extinction of most large bodied ungulates inhabiting the archipelago. Japanese wolves likely underwent a process of island dwarfism 7,000–13,000 years ago {{in response to these}} climatological and ecological pressures. C. l. hattai (formerly native to Hokkaidō) was significantly larger than its southern cousin C. l. hodophilax, as it inhabited higher elevations and had access to larger prey, as well as a continuing genetic interaction with dispersing wolves from Siberia.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{problems}} encountered with the cull, the farmers {{of the region}} once again requested military assistance in 1934, 1943, and 1948, only to be turned down by the government. Instead, the <b>bounty</b> <b>system</b> that had been instigated in 1923 was continued, and this proved to be effective: 57,034 bounties were claimed over a six-month period in 1934.|$|E
25|$|Former NFL coach Tony Dungy {{later told}} Profootballtalk.com {{he was certain}} that Williams {{operated}} a similar <b>bounty</b> <b>system</b> while he was defensive coordinator of the Oilers/Titans from 1997 to 2000. He also believes that Williams put a bounty on Indianapolis Colts quarterback Peyton Manning during Super Bowl XLIV, and targeted Manning on several occasions while with the Titans. The revelation of the <b>bounty</b> <b>system</b> also caused renewed speculation about a 2006 game between the Redskins and Colts, in which Manning was knocked down by a high-low hit from the Redskins' Phillip Daniels and Andre Carter and appeared to lose some feeling in his neck. While Dungy didn't speculate at the time about whether the Redskins targeted Manning on that play, he believes that hit ultimately caused the neck problems that sidelined Manning for the entire 2011 season and led to his departure for the Denver Broncos afterward.|$|E

Upon his suspension, Payton asked his former mentor Parcells {{if he would be}} interested in filling the head coaching vacancy. On April 11, 2012, Parcells revealed in an interview with Mike Tirico that he had decided against joining the Saints but would help Sean Payton in any way he could.|$|E
25|$|The Comanche {{conducted}} their raids in Mexico with no risk {{of retaliation}} by Mexico {{in their home}} territory north of the Rio Grande in Texas. Moreover, the Federal government of Mexico, embroiled in political disputes, gave little assistance to its northern states and their citizens {{to fend off the}} Comanche. Poorly-armed militia, organized by state and local governments and large ranchers, and hired scalp-hunters—often Anglo-Americans or other Indians—opposed the Comanche raids. Durango in 1847 adopted a <b>bounty</b> <b>system,</b> paying 50 pesos for the head of a hostile Indian. In 1849, the bounty was raised to 200 pesos per head, more than a laborer could make in wages in a full year.|$|E
25|$|Early European {{settlers}} often {{kept their}} livestock on eastern wolf-free outer islands, though animals kept in pasture {{on the mainland}} were vulnerable, {{to the point that}} a campaign against eastern wolves was launched {{in the early years of}} the Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay Colonies, in which both settlers and natives participated. A <b>bounty</b> <b>system</b> was put into effect, offering higher rewards for adult wolves, with their heads exposed on hooks in meetinghouses. Nevertheless, eastern wolves were still plentiful enough by the early 18th century to warrant the settlers of Cape Cod discussing the building of a high fence between Sandwich and Wareham to keep eastern wolves out of grazing lands. The scheme failed, though the settlers continued to utilize wolf pits, a wolf trapping technique learned from the region's indigenous peoples. Eastern wolf numbers declined noticeably shortly before and after the American Revolution, particularly in Connecticut, where the wolf bounty was repealed in 1774. Eastern wolf numbers however were still high enough to cause concern in the more sparsely populated areas of southern New Hampshire and Maine, with wolf hunting becoming a regular occupation among settlers and natives alike. By the early 19th century, few eastern wolves remained in southern New Hampshire and Vermont.|$|E

Unlike other British animals, wolves were unaffected by island dwarfism, with certain skeletal remains indicating that they may have grown as large as Arctic wolves.

25|$|Before {{the onset}} of the Meiji {{restoration}} period in 1868, wolves had a benign rather than noxious place in Japanese culture and folklore. Wolves were, however, occasionally hunted. Wolf bounties (shōkin) first appeared in Morioka where horse predation by wolves was frequent. Domain lords would pay 700 mon for males, and 900 for females, though peasants received much less. Wolves in Japan became extinct during the Meiji restoration period, an extermination known as ōkami no kujo. The wolf was deemed a threat to ranching which the Meiji government promoted at the time, and targeted via a <b>bounty</b> <b>system</b> and a direct chemical extermination campaign inspired by the similar contemporary American campaign. Starting August 1875, the Iwate Prefecture government offered bounties (shōreikin) of 7¥ for male wolves and 8 for females. In 1878 in Sapporo, it was decided to set higher bounties for wolves than bears in order to further motivate the ethnic Ainu people into killing wolves, which were once considered sacred to them. Hokkaido experienced significant development during this period and the Hokkaido wolf also suffered from resulting environmental disruption. The last Japanese wolf was a male killed on 23 January 1905 near Washikaguchi (now called Higashi Yoshiro). The carcass was bought by a man working for the Duke of Bedford, and was subsequently put on display in the British Museum of Natural History.|$|E
500|$|Further {{attempts}} of a pioneer government floundered until {{the numbers of}} American increased from travel over the Oregon Trail. Initiated by William Gray, the [...] "Wolf Meetings" [...] of early 1843 created a <b>bounty</b> <b>system</b> on predators of settler livestock. Further discussions began among the settlers until a gathering was held at Champoeg on May 2, with under 150 Americans and French-Canadians participating. The proposal for forming a provisional government was tabled and voted on twice. The first vote rejected the presented report due to {{the inclusion of a}} governor, with a second vote on each individual item proposed. On 5 July 1843 the Organic Laws of Oregon, modeled after Iowa's Organic Law and the Ordinance of 1787, were adopted by [...] colonists of the Willamette Valley, establishing the Provisional Government of Oregon.|$|E
500|$|Garfield {{not only}} favored {{abolition}} of slavery, but {{believed that the}} leaders of the rebellion had forfeited their constitutional rights. He supported the confiscation of southern plantations and even exile or execution of rebellion leaders as a means to ensure the permanent destruction of slavery. Garfield felt Congress was obliged [...] "to determine what legislation is necessary to secure equal justice to all loyal persons, without regard to color." [...] Garfield was more supportive of Lincoln when Lincoln took action against slavery. Early in his tenure, he differed from his party on several issues; his was the solitary Republican vote to terminate the use of bounties in recruiting. Some financially able recruits had used the <b>bounty</b> <b>system</b> to buy their way out of service (called commutation), which Garfield considered reprehensible. Garfield gave a speech pointing out the flaws in the existing conscription law: that of 300,000 called upon to enlist, barely 10,000 had, the remainder claiming exemption or providing money or a substitute. [...] Lincoln appeared before the Military Affairs committee on which Garfield served, demanding a more effective bill; even if it cost him re-election, Lincoln was confident he could win the war before his term expired. After many false starts, Garfield, with the support of Lincoln, procured the passage of a conscription bill that excluded commutation.|$|E
40|$|Beaver populations, extirpated in the {{previous}} century, {{have returned to the}} South often causing severe damage to timber and other resources. Many landowners perceive trapping programs as being ineffectual, perhaps because most programs are overwhelmed with immigrant beavers. To quantify immigration patterns, from November 1984 to May 1985, resident beaver were removed from a 1, 619 ha study area in west Tennessee and for the next 40 months immigrants were captured within one month of immigration. Removal patterns of the resident population (169 beavers) suggest that <b>bounty</b> <b>systems</b> may be ineffectual to protect natural resources. Immigration was low (5. 5 beavers) June to September and significantly (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) higher (46. 4 beavers) October to May...|$|R

2500|$|Dutch {{fishermen}} {{had been}} fishing for herring in the North Sea from the 15th century, and {{had developed a}} large scale system of [...] "Buss" [...] fishing in deeper waters using large boats which stayed at sea for several weeks and cured the fish aboard the vessels. To compete with this method, the Government of the day introduced a <b>bounty</b> <b>system</b> which initially rewarded fishermen for using larger vessels, but later paid the bounty based {{on the size of}} catch. This led to a gradual increase in the size of fishing vessel operating from the East Coast harbours, although open hulls were still favoured because this allowed the maximum possible catch to be accommodated.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the onset}} of the Meiji Restoration in 1868, Emperor Meiji officially ended Japan's long-standing {{isolationism}} through the Charter Oath, and sought to modernize Japan's agriculture by replacing its dependence on rice farming with American-style ranching. Ohio rancher Edwin Dun was hired as a scientific adviser in 1873 for the Kaitakushi (Hokkaido Development Agency), and began promoting ranching with state-run experimental farms. As wolf predation was inhibiting the propagation of horses in southeastern Hokkaidō and allegedly causing hardship to Ainu deer hunters, the Meiji government declared wolves as [...] "noxious animals" [...] (yūgai dōbutsu), entrusting Dun to oversee the animals' extermination. Dun began his work at the Niikappu ranch with a mass-poisoning campaign involving the use of strychnine-laced baits. This was supplemented by a <b>bounty</b> <b>system</b> established by the Kaitakushi.|$|E
2500|$|On March 6, Payton and Loomis {{issued a}} {{statement}} taking [...] "full responsibility" [...] for not stopping the alleged [...] "bounty" [...] program. Payton and Loomis also apologized to Benson and the Saints fans, and promised that such behavior would never happen again. Three days later, Drew Brees, the starting quarterback for the Saints, {{issued a statement}} denying any knowledge of or involvement in the program. On March 12, WWL-TV in New Orleans reported that Payton and Benson met with Goodell in New York {{for much of the}} morning to reiterate that the Saints would continue to cooperate fully with the NFL's investigation. On March 22, U.S. Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois announced he would invite Goodell and the heads of the other major American sports leagues to a hearing on <b>bounty</b> <b>systems.</b> He also said that unless the leagues themselves [...] "come up with standards to make sure this isn't going to happen again," [...] he may consider drafting legislation that would extend federal sports bribery laws to cover bounties.|$|R
5000|$|Williams {{was summoned}} to NFL {{headquarters}} after the investigation concluded in mid-February. He initially denied any involvement, but recanted and admitted everything {{in a meeting with}} NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. He issued a statement apologizing for his role, saying that he'd known it was wrong from the start. On March 21, 2012, the NFL suspended Williams indefinitely for [...] "conduct detrimental" [...] to the league, effective that day. In a statement, the NFL said that its investigation had found that Williams not only administered the bounty program and occasionally contributed some of his own money to the bounty pool, but lied to league investigators about his role. Consequently, the suspension would run {{until the end of the}} 2012 season at the earliest. When Williams applied for reinstatement, Goodell considered how much Williams cooperated with the NFL in its continuing investigation; Goodell also expected Williams to participate in league efforts to eliminate <b>bounty</b> <b>systems</b> altogether. The NFL is still investigating allegations that Williams ran a bounty program in Washington.|$|R

2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} Saints' <b>bounty</b> <b>system</b> came to light, four former Washington Redskins players, {{as well as}} a coach, told The Washington Post that Williams {{operated}} a similar system while he was the Redskins' defensive coordinator from 2004 to 2007. The players said that Williams paid his crew thousands of dollars for aggressive play, with the biggest payouts—as much as $8,000—coming for [...] "kill shots" [...] that knocked opposing players out of games. Chicago Tribune NFL analyst Matt Bowen, who played for the Redskins at the time, later wrote in one of his regular columns that the bounty pool was funded by fines for mistakes made during practice and in games, and insisted similar systems operated on other teams. On March 4, The Post reported that the NFL was investigating the allegations against Williams with the Redskins.|$|E

The committee's report supported the <b>bounty</b> <b>system,</b> recommended an increase in mounted police patrols and urged settlers to remain well armed and alert. Arthur, in turn, forwarded their report to Secretary of State for War and the Colonies Sir George Murray, pointing out that although [...] "lawless convicts" [...] and convict stock-keepers had acted with great inhumanity towards the black natives, [...] "it is increasingly apparent the Aboriginal natives of this colony are, and have ever been, a most treacherous race; and that the kindness and humanity which they have always experienced from the free settlers has not tended to civilize them to any degree." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several former Bills players {{subsequently}} told The Buffalo News of {{a similar}} system during Williams' tenure as Bills' head coach from 2001 to 2003. However, they didn't agree on whether there were rewards for intentionally injuring players. Coy Wire, a safety during Williams' tenure, said that Williams gave bonuses for hits that left opponents seriously injured, and two other players said that bonuses were also awarded for [...] "knockouts." [...] However, linebacker Eddie Robinson, who played for Williams in Houston and Tennessee {{as well as in}} Buffalo, acknowledged an incentive pool but said he never heard Williams favor deliberately injuring other players. Ruben Brown, a guard for the Bills during Williams's time as coach there, denied there was any sort of <b>bounty</b> <b>system</b> in place in Buffalo, a position reiterated by linebacker London Fletcher and then-general manager Tom Donahoe. Chidi Ahanotu, who played one year under Williams in Buffalo, indicated that such a program was not within his character at the time and that Williams was [...] "the softest coach I've been around." ...|$|E
2500|$|The NFL {{has long}} frowned upon bounties, or [...] "non-contract bonuses" [...] as it officially calls them; [...] but an {{underground}} culture of bounties {{is alleged to}} exist, with teams, it is claimed, [...] {{turning a blind eye}} to the practice. [...] The league constitution specifically forbids payment of bonuses based on performances against an individual player or team, as well as bonuses for on-field misconduct; the NFL holds that such practices undermine the integrity of the game, and also would allow teams to use such payments to circumvent the salary cap. The collective bargaining agreement with the NFL Players Association also forbids this practice, as does the standard NFL player contract. Every year, the NFL sends a memo reiterating this ban to every team before training camp opens. However, according to many former players, <b>bounty</b> <b>systems</b> of some sort have been around the NFL for decades, with the percentage of players participating non-scientifically estimated to be between 30 and 40 percent. [...] According to these players, such bounty programs were usually informal and often between players only, more with intent at locker-room braggadocio than systemic malice. [...] What would draw attention to the Saints' bounty program was the alleged practice of methodically organizing such a concept at the coaches' level, with the primary intent to systematically and routinely injure opposing star players.|$|R
40|$|The prize {{system for}} {{innovation}} {{has been criticized}} as impractical {{due to the lack}} of a workable formula or algorithm to determine the size of prizes. In this paper, a decentralized market mechanism via the intertemporal <b>bounty</b> (IB) <b>system</b> can function to duplicate Pareto optimality. Under this system, any bountiable innovation is placed in the public domain, and the prize of innovation is dynamically amortized in an infinitely time domain as periodic bounties paid to holders of bounty claims. Peri-odic bounties are calculated using a government-determined bounty rate times observed market sales. Two formulas are derived to calculate “long-run Pareto optimal bounty rate ” and “long-run suboptimal bounty rate. ” The former can correct monopoly distortions and externalities, while the latter can only address monopoly distortions. They are empirically computable and can serve as an upper bound and the lower bound of the bounty rate. This paper provides a dynamic general-equilibrium analysis of replacing finitely-lived patents with the IB system using either of these two bounty rates. Based on a non-scale growth model calibrated to the US economy, transition paths are worked out to compute welfare gains. [JEL Classification: C 63, O 31, O 34...|$|R

Unlockable classes are [...] "scout", [...] "trapper", [...] "gunsmith", [...] "hombre", [...] "spy", [...] "officer", [...] "duelist", and [...] "veteran".

This <b>bounty</b> <b>system</b> is used in all game modes, on all maps and with all character classes. Money earned during multiplayer games can be used to unlock character classes or to upgrade the class currently being used within the game. Upgrades feature two levels; the first level cancels out the classes' weaknesses, the second increases the classes' strengths. If the player switches classes mid-game having already upgraded another class, their upgrades will not carry across to the new class. However, if they switch back to the previously upgraded class, their upgrades will remain. Upgrades, however, do not carry across to different games.|$|E
