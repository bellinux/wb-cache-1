5|$|Born {{helpless}} {{and unable to}} move around (nidicolous and semi-altricial), the chicks are constantly brooded <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> until they are 3 to 5 days old, when they can thermoregulate their body temperature. They grow their first feathers—scapulars—at 13–15 days, followed by primaries at 24–27 days, tail feathers at 30–35 days and are fully feathered by 55 days. They are attended <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> more between the 30th and 60th days; a behavior possibly related to the greater food requirements of the chicks during those days. Semi-digested food is regurgitated and then fed to younger birds, with older birds being fed solid food. The parents {{can be seen at}} normal rates with the chicks up to about the 70th day, after which the attendance <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> falls rapidly. Chicks receive no care after fledging, with only about one out of seven chicks receiving food after the 80th day, and almost no chicks are visited after about 90 days. After fledging, the chicks will leave the nest, with few remaining after about 100 days.|$|E
5|$|The chicks are fed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> {{for several}} days after fledging. The family may travel as a group or the parents may divide the brood, taking one or two chicks each.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} novels in the series, aspects of Thunderball come from Fleming's own experiences: the visit to the health clinic was inspired by his own 1955 trip to the Enton Hall health farm and Bond's medical record, as read out to him by M, is a slightly modified version of Fleming's own. The name of the health farm, Shrublands, was taken {{from that of a}} house owned <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> of his wife's friend, Peter Quennell. Fleming dedicates a quarter of the novel to the Shrublands setting and the naturalist cure Bond undergoes.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} swallows, pairing and {{copulation}} displays are normally brief, taking {{just a few}} minutes. The male calls to a female and attempts to lead her to the nest, where he lands and continues calling while posing with lowered head, dropped wings and ruffled throat. If he is successful, the female calls and allows him to mount her, usually in the nest. Three or four white eggs are the normal clutch and all three species are frequently double-brooded. Both sexes build the nest, incubate the eggs and feed the chicks, although the female {{does most of the}} incubation, which normally lasts 14–16 days. The newly hatched chicks are altricial, and after a further 22–32 days, depending on weather, the chicks leave the nest. The fledged young stay with, and are fed <b>by,</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> for about a week after leaving the nest. Occasionally, young birds from the first brood will assist in feeding the second brood.|$|E
5|$|Bird predators may seize {{anywhere}} from 7% to 75% of the progeny in a breeding colony. The fish crow (Corvus ossifragus) is common raider of American white ibis nests, accounting {{for up to}} 44% of egg loss in a field study at Battery Island, North Carolina. Other predators of eggs and young include the boat-tailed grackle (Quiscalus major), black-crowned night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), gulls, and possibly vultures, {{as well as the}} common opossum (Didelphis marsupialis), raccoon (Procyon lotor), and rat snakes (Elaphe species). Egg predation rates of the American white ibis decline with nest age owing to increased nest attentiveness <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents,</b> especially during the last week of incubation. High nest densities and reduced synchrony increase egg predation rates because of the increased opportunities afforded by the longer incubation times, as well as the greater availability of nests available for predation.|$|E
5|$|By 24–28days after hatching, {{the young}} birds start to perch on {{branches}} near the nest {{and take their}} first flight. They are fed by their parents for a further 28–30days, staying close to the nest while growing and practicing flying. At this stage they are extremely vocal, and their cries to their parents can often be heard a considerable distance away. The young hawks disperse after their parents stop provisioning them. Though they receive {{the same amount of}} food, male chicks (roughly half the size of females) mature more quickly and seem to be ready to leave the nest sooner. In a study in the Forest of Ae, south-west Scotland, it was found that 21% of nestlings over two days old died, with the causes of death being starvation, wet weather, predation and desertion <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents.</b> The parasite Leucocytozoon toddi can be passed from parent to nestling at the nest, possibly {{because of the number of}} birds sharing a small space, thus allowing transmission.|$|E

5|$|In December 2006, the Kalpoes filed a slander and {{libel suit}} against Skeeters (who died in January 2007) and Dr. Phil. in Los Angeles. Holloway's parents responded by filing a {{wrongful}} death {{lawsuit against the}} Kalpoes in the same venue. The wrongful death suit was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction on June 1, 2007; the libel and slander case was initially set for trial on October 12, 2011 but was later set for April 2015. An earlier suit had been filed in New York City <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> against Paulus and Joran van der Sloot and served on them {{on a visit to}} New York. The case had been dismissed in August 2006 as filed in an inconvenient forum.|$|E
5|$|Incubation of {{the eggs}} lasts 11 to 13 days and is {{performed}} solely by the female. The hatchlings are naked and quills do not begin to show until the third day. Only females brood the nestlings, though both parents may bring whole insects to their young. When a young rufous-crowned sparrow leaves the nest after eight or nine days, it is still incapable of flight, though it can run through the underbrush; during this time it is still fed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents.</b> Juveniles tend to leave their parent's territory and move into adjacent habitat in autumn or early winter. Reproductive success varies strongly with annual rainfall and is highest in wet El Niño years, since cool rainy weather reduces the activity of snakes, the main predator of the sparrow's nests.|$|E
5|$|The clutch is {{two to five}} {{eggs that}} are white with brownish, ruddy or grey blotches {{particularly}} at the wide end. The egg size ranges from an average 20.2x14.0mm (0.80x0.55in) with a weight of 2.08g (0.073oz) for the Eurasian crag martin to 17.7x13.0mm (0.70x0.51in) with a weight of 1.57g (0.06oz) for the dusky crag martin. Both adults incubate the eggs for 13–19 days to hatching, and feed the chicks at least ten times an hour until they fledge 24–27 days later. The fledged young continue to be fed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> for some time after they can fly.|$|E

5|$|The female incubates for 12–14 {{days before}} the altricial chicks are hatched naked and blind. Fledging takes another 10–19 (average 13.6) days, with both parents feeding the young and {{removing}} faecal sacs. The nest is often ill-concealed {{compared with those of}} other species, and many breeding attempts fail due to predation. The young are fed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> for up to three weeks after leaving the nest, and will follow the adults begging for food. If the female starts another nest, the male alone will feed the fledged young. Second broods are common, with the female reusing the same nest if the brood was successful, and three broods may be raised in the south of the common blackbird's range.|$|E
5|$|The first egg {{is often}} laid when the nest {{is little more}} than a pad of grass, and a further egg is laid on each {{subsequent}} day. Both sexes incubate the eggs, which start hatching after about 14days; all hatch with 48hours despite the extended laying period. The black, downy precocial chicks soon leave the nest but are fed and protected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents.</b> Fledging occurs after four to six weeks, and the young can fly before they are fully grown. It is not known whether the African crake has a second brood, but the corn crake usually does. Where grass is not tall enough at the start of the season, the first nest may be constructed in herby or marsh vegetation, with the second brood in hay. The second nest may also be at a higher altitude that the first, to take advantage of the later-developing grasses further up a hill.|$|E
5|$|The {{length and}} nature of parental care varies widely amongst {{different}} orders and species. At one extreme, parental care in megapodes ends at hatching; the newly hatched chick digs itself out of the nest mound without parental assistance and can fend for itself immediately. At the other extreme, many seabirds have extended periods of parental care, the longest being that of the great frigatebird, whose chicks take {{up to six months}} to fledge and are fed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> for up to an additional 14 months. The chick guard stage describes the period of breeding during which one of the adult birds is permanently present at the nest after chicks have hatched. The main purpose of the guard stage is to aid offspring to thermoregulate and protect them from predation.|$|E

5|$|When hatched, {{the chicks}} are downy. Neither altricial nor precocial, the chicks {{begin to move}} around and explore their {{surroundings}} within one to three days after hatching. Usually they do not stray far from the nest. Chicks are brooded by the adults for the first ten days after hatching. Both parents care for hatchlings. Chick diets always include fish, and parents selectively bring larger prey items to chicks than they eat themselves. Males bring more food than females. Feeding <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> lasts for roughly a month before being weaned off slowly. After fledging, the juveniles learn to feed themselves, including the difficult method of plunge-diving. They will fly south to winter {{with the help of}} their parents.|$|E
5|$|After {{copulation}} it {{is generally}} the male who gathers sticks and the female that constructs the loosely woven nest. The nest is subsequently covered with (and cemented by) guano. Frigatebirds prefer to nest in trees or bushes, though when these are not available they will nest on the ground. A single white egg that weighs up to 6–7% of mother's body mass is laid, and is incubated in turns by both birds for 41 to 55 days. The altricial chicks are naked on hatching and develop a white down. They are continuously guarded <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> for the first 4–6 weeks and are fed on the nest for 5–6 months. Both parents take turns feeding {{for the first three}} months, after which the male's attendance tails off leaving the mother to feed the young for another six to nine months on average. The chicks feed by reaching their heads in their parents' throat and eating the part-regurgitated food. It takes so long to rear a chick that frigatebirds generally breed every other year.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} eight {{members of}} the parliament are elected from the twelfth constituency. It encompasses the entire country; candidates in this constituency are elected by voters belonging to 22 recognized minorities in Croatia: the Serb minority elects three MPs, the Hungarians and Italians elect one MP each, the Czech and Slovak minorities jointly elect one MP, and all other minorities elect the final two MPs. Minority MPs are elected by simple plurality system (candidates with the most number of votes are elected). The nationality of the voters is listed in the voter registry, which {{is provided by the}} registrar's office that maintains Croatia's vital records. Voter nationalities are normally officially declared <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> at birth, but any citizen may declare or change that information later on at the registrar's office at least 14 days ahead of elections (not at the polling station). The voter's nationality need not be declared or may be declared as unknown. During elections, voters who have officially declared they belong to one of the recognized minorities in Croatia may choose to vote for either a territorially applicable list or a corresponding national minority list; a voter of unknown or non-declared nationality may vote for either a territorially applicable list or any minority list; a voter who has declared a nationality other than Croat or a recognized minority may vote only for a territorially applicable list (the same as someone who has declared themselves a Croat).|$|E

5|$|Some birds, {{especially}} corvids and parrots, {{are among}} the most intelligent animals; several bird species make and use tools, and many social species pass on knowledge across generations, which is considered a form of culture. Many species annually migrate great distances. Birds are social, communicating with visual signals, calls, and bird songs, and participating in such social behaviours as cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking, and mobbing of predators. The vast majority of bird species are socially monogamous (referring to social living arrangement, distinct from genetic monogamy), usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, but rarely for life. Other species have breeding systems that are polygynous (arrangement of one male with many females) or, rarely, polyandrous (arrangement of one female with many males). Birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilised through sexual reproduction. They are usually laid in a nest and incubated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents.</b> Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching. Some birds, such as hens, lay eggs even when not fertilised, though unfertilised eggs do not produce offspring.|$|E
5|$|The eggs hatch {{after about}} three weeks and the young are {{attended}} by both parents. Males are present around the nest {{for most of the}} day, and females most of the night. The parents exchange nest duties in the morning and in the evening. Most of the feeding of the chicks occurs during the period where they swap nesting duties. Little feeding is done in the period of the day that is between the two duty swaps and no feeding is done between midnight and 6a.m. Chick mortality is highest in the first twenty days post hatching, with anywhere from 37 to 83% of hatchlings surviving to three weeks of age in the Everglades. During periods of food limitations and starvation events, the American white ibis tends to exhibit sex-dependent pre-fledgling mortality. For many bird species that have sexually dimorphic nestlings, mortality rates are higher for larger-sized male nestlings {{as a result of the}} parents' inability to meet its greater nutritional needs. However, in the case of the American white ibis, the male nestlings actually have a lower mortality rate as compared to the females despite being on average 15% greater in mass as compared to its female counterparts. Although current research has yet to discover the underlying factors to why the males tend to have better survival rates under such conditions, it is suspected that the parents tend to feed the larger male nestlings first because they are either perceived <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> to have a higher chance of survival, or, being generally larger, the male nestlings simply out-compete the small females for food.|$|E
5|$|Toivonen {{had strong}} ties to {{rallying}} at an early age. He was born in Jyväskylä, the city which has hosted the Rally Finland since 1951. His father, Pauli Toivonen, was a successful international rally driver who {{would go on to}} win the Monte Carlo, 1000 Lakes and Acropolis rallies and become the 1968 European Rally Champion. Henri Toivonen learned to drive when he was five years old, but despite his rallying connections, started competition in circuit racing. He began with karts and won the Finnish Cup in touring cars before switching to Formula Vee, winning one round of the Scandinavian Championship in his first year. Toivonen graduated to Formula Super Vee the following year and won a round of the European Championship, as well as becoming the 1977 Finnish Champion in the Formula Vee class. Due to his family's concerns about the safety of circuit racing, he switched to rallying full-time.
