5|$|As Zeke {{continued}} to be hampered by strong shear, it gradually <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> towards the north as the trough that caused it to weaken moved further east. Late on October27, convection redeveloped over the center of circulation, allowing the storm to re-attain tropical storm intensity. The strengthening followed {{the passage of a}} shortwave trough; however, shear over the system remained strong. Despite the unfavorable conditions, Zeke maintained its intensity, through intermittent bursts of convection, and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> towards the northeast. Late on October29, a large burst of deep convection over the center of the storm allowed for intensification. Around this time, the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of 50mph (85km/h) with a barometric pressure of 1000mbar (hPa; 29.53inHg).|$|E

5|$|The fifth {{storm of}} the season formed on September 3 in the western Atlantic. It drifted west-{{northwest}}ward, slowly gaining intensity, and turned northwest on September 8. However, the tropical storm then changed course and began to head west-northwest on September 11 as it slowly intensified. By September 12, the tropical storm had intensified to a minimal hurricane, and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> towards the north-northwest on September 13. It attained its peak winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) on September 14. As it maintained its intensity on September 15, the hurricane <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> westward while it continued to approach the coast of South Carolina on September 17. The hurricane made landfall near Myrtle Beach later on September 17, and quickly weakened to a tropical storm as it moved inland. The storm dissipated as a tropical depression on September 18 over Tennessee.|$|E

5|$|Late in {{the evening}} of September 18, Karl {{attained}} Category3 status, becoming the sixth major hurricane of 2004. On September 19, Karl continued to strengthen, maintaining a well-defined eye, and strengthening late that day into a Category4 hurricane with winds of 135mph (215km/h) and a minimum pressure of 948mbar. Early on September 20, the storm weakened slightly {{as a result of}} an eyewall replacement cycle, weakening back to a strong Category3 hurricane. At this time Karl <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> sharply northward into a weakness in the subtropical ridge.|$|E

5|$|A {{deepening}} trough {{over the}} eastern United States was forecast {{to turn the}} storm toward the north on August16. This turn took place earlier than forecasters anticipated. The storm slowly intensified as convection was displaced {{from the center of}} circulation; however, upper-level outflow was well-defined and intensification of the storm was expected as it tracked over the Gulf Stream. Later that day, Bob began to consolidate and a reconnaissance plane recorded hurricane-force winds at 1719UTC, following this reading, the NHC upgraded the storm to a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Shortly after, the hurricane <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> towards the north-northeast in response to a subtropical ridge over the Atlantic and the trough over the southeastern United States.|$|E
5|$|After {{moderate}} {{sales of}} their debut album Cheshire Cat (1995), released on independent record label Cargo Music, Blink-182 enjoyed {{a small amount}} of success. Throughout 1994 and 1995, the trio vigorously toured nonstop and grew in popularity, mostly in Australia, where audiences embraced the band's irreverent sense of humor and stage shows. When the trio grew frustrated when fans lamented the inability to purchase Cheshire Cat at their respective local record stores, they <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> toward other record labels to achieve wider distribution than Cargo. By the end of 1995, problems had become apparent between the trio and the label, who regarded the band as a joke not to be taken seriously.|$|E
5|$|Early on September 21, {{the motion}} {{shifted to the}} north as it moved along the {{northwest}} periphery of the subtropical ridge. That general motion continued throughout the day, however, Helene <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> more northeastward that evening {{along the edge of}} the subtropical ridge, east of Bermuda. A decrease in wind shear and relatively warm water around 81°F (27°C) kept the intensity mostly stationary, keeping Helene as a Category1 hurricane. The intensity held around 80mph (130km/h) before strengthening slightly late on September 22, despite losing some tropical characteristics (it was operationally downgraded to a tropical storm for a brief period) as it accelerated northeast in the north Atlantic. A QuikSCAT analysis early on September 23 confirmed a high-end Category1 hurricane with 90mph (145km/h) winds.|$|E

Brokamp, with no previous arts experience, <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> the school around. A new emphasis on academics, more Advanced Placement courses and more stringent audition standards that admitted only the most dedicated students led to better test scores and a higher level of artistic talent; Brokamp pushed to expand the school's vocational training programs in photography, stage management, and costume design by 50percent. Applications to audition more than tripled by 2001 and fund-raising rebounded.|$|E
5|$|Gomez proved {{his critics}} wrong {{when he arrived}} at the fight in prime {{condition}} and with aggression, determination and desire. The first two rounds started at a furious pace, with Arthur keeping Gomez at bay with stiff jabs and Gomez working inside with hooks and body punches. The match was turning into a clash of opposing styles, Arthur displaying control and boxing technique and Gomez storming forward with wild ferocity. From the third round the fight <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> Gomez's way. Gomez cut Arthur in the third and silenced the home crowd, who were not used to seeing the home-town hero being battered in this manner. Gomez dominated the fourth round and was in full control of the fight—he exposed Arthur's weak defence and at one stage landed 28 punches without reply.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Della {{was first}} {{identified}} on September1 southeast of Hawaii as a tropical depression. The depression quickly intensified into {{a tropical storm}} as it traveled northwest; however, operational advisories were not issued until September3. By that time, a ship reported they had encountered a storm and recorded winds of 100mph (155km/h). Radar images also depicted an eye had developed within the storm. After becoming a hurricane, Della began a gradual turn towards the southwest. During the day on September4, the storm passed roughly 10mi (15km) south of the French Frigate Shoals, bringing strong winds gusting up to 110mph (175km/h). During the storm's passage, a pressure of 980mbar (hPa) was recorded, the lowest {{in relation to the}} storm. By September9, Della <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> westward as it approached the International Date Line with winds of 85mph (140km/h).|$|E
5000|$|The {{circuits}} {{at right}} and left operate more efficiently from a single (V) supply. In both circuits, R1 allows Q1 <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> on and pass voltage and current to the load. When the current through R_sense exceeds the design limit, Q2 <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> on, which in <b>turn</b> <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> off Q1, thus limiting the load current. The optional component R2 protects Q2 {{in the event of}} a short-circuited load. When V is at least a few volts, a MOSFET can be used for Q1 for lower dropout voltage. Due to its simplicity, this circuit is sometimes used as a current source for high-power LEDs.|$|R

5|$|In 855, Michael III turned {{fifteen and}} thus came {{nominally}} of age. His mother and Theoktistos both underestimated the young emperor's desire to free himself from their custodianship, and antagonized him further when they arranged a bride show and selected Eudokia Dekapolitissa as his bride, disregarding Michael's attachment to his mistress, Eudokia Ingerina. Theodora's brother Bardas {{was able to}} use Michael's resentment for the high-handed manner in which he was treated and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> him against the regency. With Michael's backing, Bardas was allowed to return to the capital, and on 20 November 855, Theoktistos was murdered. Theodora was compelled to retire to a monastery a few months later, bringing the regency officially to an end.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the renewal of Arab invasions, and to a sequence of natural disasters such as the eruptions of the volcanic island of Thera, the Emperor Leo III the Isaurian concluded that the Empire had lost divine favour. Already in 722 {{he had tried to}} force the conversion of the Empire's Jews, but soon he <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> his attention to the veneration of icons, which some bishops had come to regard as idolatrous. In 726, Leo published an edict condemning their use and showed himself increasingly critical of the iconophiles. He formally banned depictions of religious figures in a court council in 730.|$|E

Together with Maria Trubnikova, Nadezhda Stasova and Evgenia Konradi, she lobbied the Emperor to create and fund higher education courses for women. She was also {{a founding member of}} the Russian Women's Mutual Philanthropic Society and responsible for helping to organize the All-Women's Congress of 1908.|$|E
