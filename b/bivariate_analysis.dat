50|$|The {{main reason}} for {{differentiating}} univariate and <b>bivariate</b> <b>analysis</b> is that <b>bivariate</b> <b>analysis</b> is not only simple descriptive analysis, but also it describes the relationship between two different variables.Quantitative measures of dependence include correlation (such as Pearson's r when both variables are continuous, or Spearman's rho if one or both are not) and covariance (which reflects the scale variables are measured on). The slope, in regression analysis, also reflects the relationship between variables. The unstandardised slope indicates the unit change in the criterion variable for a one unit change in the predictor. The standardised slope indicates this change in standardised (z-score) units.Highly skewed data are often transformed by taking logarithms. Use of logarithms makes graphs more symmetrical and look more similar to the normal distribution, making them easier to interpret intuitively.|$|E
5000|$|Graphs {{that are}} {{appropriate}} for <b>bivariate</b> <b>analysis</b> depend {{on the type of}} variable. For two continuous variables, a scatterplot is a common graph.

40|$|In this study, a {{framework}} {{to project the}} potential future climate change impacts on extreme hydrological drought events in the Weihe River basin in North China is presented. This framework includes a large-scale hydrological model driven by climate outputs from a regional climate model for historical streamflow simulations and future streamflow projections, and models for univariate drought assessment and copula-based <b>bivariate</b> drought <b>analysis.</b> It is projected by the univariate drought analysis that future climate change would lead to increased frequencies of extreme hydrological drought events with higher severity. The bivariate drought assessment using copula shows that future droughts in the same return periods as historical droughts would be potentially longer and more severe, in terms of drought duration and severity. This trend would deteriorate the hydrological drought situation in the Weihe River basin. In addition, the uncertainties associated with climate models, hydrological models, and univariate and <b>bivariate</b> drought <b>analysis</b> should be quantified in the future research to improve the reliability of this study...|$|R

This research presents the application of risk and uncertainty analysis to dam overtopping based on univariate and bivariate flood frequency analyses by applying Gumbel logistic distribution for the Doroudzan earth-fill dam in south of Iran. The <b>bivariate</b> frequency <b>analysis</b> resulted in six inflow hydrographs with a joint return period of 100 -yr.

40|$|International audienceOur {{specific}} aims were {{to evaluate}} the power of <b>bivariate</b> <b>analysis</b> and to compare its performance with traditional univariate analysis in samples of unrelated subjects under varying sampling selection designs.

Our simulation results confirmed that the power of <b>bivariate</b> <b>analysis</b> is affected by the size, direction and source of the phenotypic correlations between traits.

In addition, we demonstrated the efficacy of SUR-based bivariate test by applying it to a real Genome-Wide Association Study of Bone Mineral Density values measured at the Lumbar Spine and at the Femoral Neck in a sample of unrelated males with low Bone Mineral Density (LS Zscores 0. 5).
