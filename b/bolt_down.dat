2500|$|Crazy Horse's vision {{first took}} him to the South where, in Lakota spirituality, one goes upon death. He was brought back and was taken to the West in the {{direction}} of the wakiyans (thunder beings). He was given a medicine bundle to protect him for life. One of his animal protectors would be the white owl which, according to Lakota spirituality, would give extended life. He was also shown his [...] "face paint" [...] for battle, to consist of a yellow lightning <b>bolt</b> <b>down</b> the left side of his face, and white powder. He would wet this and put marks over his vulnerable areas; when dried, the marks looked like hailstones. His face paint was similar to that of his father, who used a red lightning strike down the right side of his face and three red hailstones on his forehead. Crazy Horse put no make-up on his forehead and did not wear a war bonnet. Lastly, he was given a sacred song that is still sung by the Oglala people today and he was told he would be a protector of his people.|$|E
6000|$|Campbell: [...] "Well, then, we {{must get}} the next out. No time to lose. Come! Keep shoving the pick in, and I'll scratch the <b>bolt</b> <b>down</b> with my knife. See? It's nothing." [...] They pull the drawer out {{and set it on}} the floor, and Roberts ruefully contemplates it.|$|E

Men of that class hate a traitor worse than they do crime, Captain Cuffe, and they'll ride <b>Bolt</b> <b>down</b> like the main tack." ...|$|E

There are more breastplates than gaberdines to be seen, I promise you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see," [...] said he. [...] "That trap-door {{was made}} to fall down, and not to lift up, and when I pulled the <b>bolt,</b> <b>down</b> it went, and the ladder, being on top of it, slipped into that hole. Heavens!" [...] he said, as a cold sweat burst out over him at the thought, [...] "suppose I had {{made up my mind}} to cut that bolt! Where would I have gone to?" ...|$|E
60|$|Peggy, who {{had been}} in the hall, now made a <b>bolt</b> <b>down</b> the back stairs into the {{basement}} regions, where was situated the kitchen. In this spacious apartment she found Aunt Judy, the cook, sitting before a large wood fire, and holding in her hand a long iron ladle. There was nothing near her which she could dip or stir with a ladle, and it was probably retained during her period of leisure as a symbol of her position and authority.|$|E
40|$|An {{engine bed}} for a 3 hp Acadia engine in a {{traditional}} wooden boat. The prop shaft would be <b>bolted</b> <b>down</b> first (it connects with the round piece of metal near the back) and then the engine would be <b>bolted</b> <b>down.</b> This is done {{to ensure that the}} proper alignment is used. It is easier to adjust the prop shaft with shimmies when the engine is free to move...|$|R

60|$|He fooled Daylight completely. At {{the end of}} {{half an hour of}} goodness, Daylight, lured into confidence, {{was riding}} along at a walk and rolling a cigarette, with slack knees and relaxed seat, the reins lying on the animal's neck. Bob whirled {{abruptly}} and with lightning swiftness, pivoting on his hind legs, his fore legs just lifted clear of the ground. Daylight found himself with his right foot out of the stirrup and his arms around the animal's neck; and Bob took advantage of the situation to <b>bolt</b> <b>down</b> the road. With a hope that he should not encounter Dede Mason at that moment, Daylight regained his seat and checked in the horse.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we did pretend {{as well as}} we could; but {{everybody}} hugged the port side o’ the ship, and was ready to <b>bolt</b> <b>down</b> below at the shortest notice; and at last, when the beast got craning its neck up over the side as though it was looking for something, we gave it some more grub. We thought if we didn’t give it he might take it, and take it off the wrong shelf, so to speak. But, as the mate said, it was encouraging it, and long arter it was dark we could hear it snorting and splashing behind us, until at last it ’ad such an effect on us the mate sent one o’ the chaps down to rouse the skipper.|$|E
6000|$|Campbell: [...] "Not at all. You {{just set}} the pick in {{here over the}} lock, and pry. I sha'n't leave a scratch." [...] They stoop down {{together}} {{in front of the}} bureau, and Campbell shows him how. [...] "But {{what are you going to}} do? You've got to have your clothes if you're going to the musicale. Ah, here we are! Thanks," [...] as Bella comes with the ice-pick, which he pushes in over the lock of the lowest drawer. [...] "We'll begin with the lowest, because that's where Amy keeps mine, and if Agnes has got onto it through her, she'll be sure to do exactly the same. Now, then, I just scratch the <b>bolt</b> <b>down</b> with my knife, and Open, Sesame! What do you say to bruising your old bureau now?" ...|$|E

60|$|Though {{amid all}} the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight, sharks will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship's decks, like hungry dogs round a table where red meat is being carved, ready to <b>bolt</b> <b>down</b> every killed man that is tossed to them; and though, while the valiant butchers over the deck-table are thus cannibally carving each other's live meat with carving-knives all gilded and tasselled, the sharks, also, with their jewel-hilted mouths, are quarrelsomely carving away under {{the table at the}} dead meat; and though, were you to turn the whole affair upside down, it would still be pretty much the same thing, that is to say, a {{shocking}} sharkish business enough for all parties; and though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships crossing the Atlantic, systematically trotting alongside, to be handy in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere, or a dead slave to be decently buried; and though one or two other like instances might be set down, touching the set terms, places, and occasions, when sharks do most socially congregate, and most hilariously feast; yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless numbers, and in gayer or more jovial spirits, than around a dead sperm whale, moored by night to a whaleship at sea. If you have never seen that sight, then suspend your decision about the propriety of devil-worship, and the expediency of conciliating the devil.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{ran like}} a buck, still keeping {{hold of my}} gun, however. My idea, so far as I {{could be said to}} have any fixed idea, was to <b>bolt</b> <b>down</b> the pathway up which I had come, like a rabbit down a burrow, trusting that he would lose sight of me in the {{uncertain}} light. I sped across the glade. Fortunately the bull, being wounded, could not go full speed; but wounded or no, he could go quite as fast as I could. I was unable to gain an inch, and away we went, with just about three feet between our separate extremities. We were at the other side now, and a glance served to show me that I had miscalculated and overshot the opening. To reach it now was hopeless; I should have blundered straight into the elephant. So I did the only thing I could do: I swerved like a course hare, and started off round the edge of the glade, seeking for some opening into which I could plunge. This gave me a moment's start, for the bull could not turn as quickly as I could, and I made the most of it. But no opening could I see; the bush was like a wall. We were speeding round the edge of the glade, and the elephant was coming up again. Now he was within about six feet, and now, as he trumpeted or rather screamed, I could feel the fierce hot blast of his breath strike upon my head. Heavens! how it frightened me! ...|$|E
6000|$|He was {{a middle-aged}} man with an inattentive manner, and {{apparently}} wrapped up in such a taciturn concern for his engines {{that he seemed to}} have lost the use of speech. When addressed directly his only answer would be a grunt or a hoot, according to the distance. For all the years {{he had been in the}} Sofala he had never been known to exchange as much as a frank Good-morning with any of his shipmates. He did not seem aware that men came and went in the world; he did not seem to see them at all. Indeed he never recognized his ship mates on shore. At table (the four white men of the Sofala messed together) he sat looking into his plate dispassionately, but at the end of the meal would jump up and <b>bolt</b> <b>down</b> below as if a sudden thought had impelled him to rush and see whether somebody had not stolen the engines while he dined. In port at the end of the trip he went ashore regularly, but no one knew where he spent his evenings or in what manner. The local coasting fleet had preserved a wild and incoherent tale of his infatuation for the wife of a sergeant in an Irish infantry regiment. The regiment, however, had done its turn of garrison duty there ages before, and was gone somewhere to the other side of the earth, out of men's knowledge. Twice or perhaps three times in the course of the year he would take too much to drink. On these occasions he returned on board at an earlier hour than usual; ran across the deck balancing himself with his spread arms like a tight-rope walker; and locking the door of his cabin, he would converse and argue with himself the livelong night in an amazing variety of tones; storm, sneer, and whine with an inexhaustible persistence. Massy in his berth next door, raising himself on his elbow, would discover that his second had remembered the name of every white man that had passed through the Sofala for years and years back. He remembered the names of men that had died, that had gone home, that had gone to America: he remembered in his cups the names of men whose connection with the ship had been so short that Massy had almost forgotten its circumstances and could barely recall their faces. The inebriated voice on the other side of the bulkhead commented upon them all with an extraordinary and ingenious venom of scandalous inventions. It seems they had all offended him in some way, and in return he had found them all out. He muttered darkly; he laughed sardonically; he crushed them one after another; but of his chief, Massy, he babbled with an envious and naive admiration. Clever scoundrel! Don't meet the likes of him every day. Just look at him. Ha! Great! Ship of his own. Wouldn't catch him going wrong. No fear--the beast! And Massy, after listening with a gratified smile to these artless tributes to his greatness, would begin to shout, thumping at the bulkhead with both fists-- ...|$|E

50|$|Willis then {{escaped from}} the {{hospital}} by turning herself into an electric current. Confronting Superman, she had rearranged the electrons of the hospital gown she was wearing into a black leotard with a lightning <b>bolt</b> <b>down</b> the front and black boots.

The two spacewalkers installed a computer network cable on the Unity node that was to permit astronauts in the U.S. segment of the station to command systems in the Russian segment and opened the Hydrogen vent valve on the Destiny laboratory installed by Mission Specialist James Reilly during EVA 3. Swanson and Forrester also attempted to <b>bolt</b> <b>down</b> two debris shield panels {{that could not be}} put back in place during an earlier spacewalk. since the two were also not able to get it anchored, they tethered the panels on the space station's service module.|$|E
5000|$|In Greek mythology, Lampetia (Λαμπετίη or Λαμπετία) (English translation: [...] "shining") was the {{daughter}} of Helios and Neaera; she was the personification of light.

She ran to her father when Odysseus' men slaughtered and sacrificed some of his ageless and deathless cattle. Her father, Helios, was enraged and asked the gods to avenge the deaths of his cattle, threatening to bring sunlight to the underworld if the men were not punished. Zeus then sent a lightning <b>bolt</b> <b>down</b> and a storm, killing all of Odysseus' men, a doom which was portended by the meat writhing and lowing on the spits.|$|E
