40|$|We have {{evaluated}} {{the performances of}} bidirectional optical amplifiers which were suited for the cost-effective implementation of amplified bidirectional passive optical networks (PONs). First, we measured the maximum gains of two simple bidirectional optical amplifiers implemented without using any optical components for the suppression of reflected signals. From the results, the maximum gains of two simple bidirectional amplifiers with a broadband light source (BLS) seeded optical source were limited to be 27 dB due to the reflection-induced in-band crosstalk, when the reflectance coefficients were measured to be- 33 dB in both directions. Then, we have also implemented a bidirectional optical amplifier with two <b>band</b> <b>splitters</b> for the amplified bidirectional PON where the two different wavelength bands were allocated to the downstream and upstream signals transmission. In our measurement, we confirmed that the maximum gain of bidirectional optical amplifier with two <b>band</b> <b>splitters</b> could be increased to more than 30 dB owing to the efficient suppression of in-band crosstalk...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{presents}} a W-band transmit-receive phased array and THz multiplier arrays in SiGe BiCMOS and CMOS technologies. First, a 4 x 4 transmit/receive SiGe BiCMOS phased array chip in an advanced SiGe technology (IBM 8 HP) at 90 - 100 GHz with {{vertical and horizontal}} polarization capabilities, 3 -bit gain control (9 dB) and 4 -bit phase control is presented. The 4 x 4 phased array fits into a 1. 6 x 1. 5 mm² grid, which is required at 94 GHz for wide scan-angle designs. The chip has simultaneous receive beam capabilities (V and H) and this is accomplished using dual -nested 16 : 1 Wilkinson combiners/divider with high isolation. The phase shifter {{is based on a}} vector- modulator with optimized design between circuit level and electromagnetic simulation and results in 10, 000 elements using polyimide redistribution layers on top of the chip and the application areas are in W-band radars for landing systems. Next, a CMOS amplifier-multiplier-antenna array capable of generating an EIRP of 3 - 4 dBm at 420 GHz is presented. The chip is built using a 45 nm CMOS SOI (IBM 12 SOI) process and efficient on-chip antennas are used to extract the power out of the chip. The design is based on a 90 - 110 GHz distribution network with splitters and amplifiers, and a balanced quadrupler capable of delivering up > 100 [mu]W of power at 370 - 430 GHz. The amplifier-multiplier concept is proven on a 2 x 4 array, and can be also scaled to any NxM array using additional W- <b>band</b> <b>splitters</b> and amplifiers. Finally, a 2 x 2 amplifier- multiplier array with on-chip antennas at 163 - 180 GHz in 45 nm CMOS SOI technology is presented. The measured EIRP is > 2 dBm at 165 - 175 GHz with a peak value of 5 dBm at 170 GHz meeting the stringiest metal-density rules for antennas. The design is based on a 80 - 100 GHz distribution network with splitters and amplifiers, and a balanced doubler capable of delivering up > 0. 5 mW of power at 170 - 190 GH...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{analysis and}} design of multilayer ultra wide <b>band</b> (UWB) power <b>splitter</b> suitable for wireless communications. An UWB power splitter is designed in suspended substrate stripline medium. The quarter wave transformer in the conventional Wilkinson power divider is replaced by broadside coupled lines to achieve tight coupling for broadband operation. The UWB power splitter is analyzed using circuit models of coupled lines and full wave simulator. Experimental results of 3 dB power splitter designed using the proposed structure have been verified against the results from circuit simulation and full wave simulation. The return loss is better than 12 dB across the band 3. 1 GHz to 10. 6 GHz. Size of the power splitter is 30 mm× 20 mm× 6. 38 mm...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{extremely}} broadband Rayleigh resonant reflector with sharp angular spectra operating in near infrared wavelength band, this device {{consisting of a}} single germanium resonant grating layer is designed and analyzed by using with the rigorous vector diffraction theory. At the Rayleigh angle, the first diffracted order can be appear from evanescent to a propagating one, thus, a very sharp angular spectrum characteristics can be presented in the device. Based on the guided mode resonant effect, high index material such as silicon and germanium can be designed as wide <b>band</b> reflector, beam <b>splitter</b> and polarizer in near infrared wavelength region. Through connecting Rayleigh phenomena and guided mode resonant effect, we can design {{a new kind of}} optical devices with versatile characteristics such as sharp angular spectra and extremely wide reflection band. In this paper, we present a Rayleigh resonant reflector with extremely high reflection (R> 99. 5 %) for TE polarization light over similar to 600 nm wavelength range and sharp angular spectral distribution. In addition, it is shown from our calculations that the high-index nano-layer located adjacent to the substrate is seen to critically affect the resulting spectra of Rayleigh resonant reflector.

40|$|Broadband laser {{sources are}} very {{attractive}} for optical communications and technologies requiring low-coherence laser sources. The supercontinuum (SC) {{is generated by}} ultra-short pulsed or continuous wave (CW) lasers that are injected into fibers with high nonlinearity. Mode-locked lasers and Raman fiber lasers are generally used in the two pumping regimes. Pumping with 975 -nm multimode laser diode is considered a low cost technology in the CW regime. However, {{it has not been}} well investigated. This thesis studies the SC generation process using low-cost 975 -nm multimode laser diodes, a piece of Erbium/Ytterbium co-doped fiber (EYDF) and two units of highly nonlinear fibers (HNLFs) with different dispersion properties around 1550 nm wavelengths. Three broadband and high optical power SCs extending to 2000 nm wavelength are successfully generated, one in ring and two in single-line structure. To our knowledge, they are the broadest SCs using this low cost technology. In addition, one of the two SCs in the single-line structure even covers a wavelength range from 1200 nm to more than 2000 nm by getting rid of the <b>band</b> limit of <b>splitter.</b> Moreover, the key role of four-wave mixing (FWM) in the broadness and flatness of CW pumped SC are demonstrated. The demonstration is more evident than previous works and convergence is obtained in the two pumping regimes on the importance of FWM in SC generation. Our designs realize fiber laser sources with high power, broad bandwidth and reduced cost...|$|R
40|$|Bolometers are {{the most}} {{sensitive}} detectors for measuring millimeter and submillimeter wavelength astrophysical signals. Cameras comprised of arrays of bolometers have already {{made significant contributions to}} the field of astronomy. A challenge for bolometer cameras is obtaining observations at multiple wavelengths. Traditionally, observing in multiple bands requires a partial disassembly of the instrument to replace bandpass filters, a task which prevents immediate spectral interrogation of a source. More complex cameras have been constructed to observe in several <b>bands</b> using beam <b>splitters</b> and dichroic filters, but the added complexity leads to physically larger instruments with reduced efficiencies. The SPEctral Energy Distribution camera (SPEED) is a new type of bolometer camera designed to efficiently observe in multiple wavebands without the need for excess bandpass filters and beam splitters. ^ SPEED is a ground-based millimeter-wave bolometer camera designed to observe at 2. 1, 1. 3, 1. 1, and 0. 85 mm simultaneously. SPEED makes use of a new type of bolometer, the frequency selective bolometer (FSB), to observe all of the wavebands within each of the camera’s four pixels. FSBs incorporate frequency selective dipole surfaces as absorbing elements allowing each detector to absorb a single, narrow band of radiation and pass all other radiation with low loss. Each FSB also contains a superconducting transition-edge sensor (TES) that acts as a sensitive thermistor for measuring the temperature of the FSB. ^ This thesis describes the development of the SPEED camera and FSB detectors. The design of the detectors used in the instrument is described as well as the the general optical performance of frequency selective dipole surfaces. Laboratory results of both the optical and thermal properties of millimeter-wave FSBs are also presented. The SPEED instrument and its components are highlighted and the optical design of the optics which couple SPEED to the Heinrich Hertz Telescope is given. This thesis concludes with an introduction to the jiggle mapping data analysis of bolometer instruments like SPEED. ...|$|R
