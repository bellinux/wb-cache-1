5|$|As {{lieutenant}} governor, Collins {{presided over}} the state Senate. Members of both major parties praised Collins for her impartiality and knowledge of parliamentary procedure in this role. She was twice called upon to break tie votes in the Senate, once on a bill allowing the state's teachers to engage in collective bargaining and another on a bill to allow branch banking across county lines within the state; in <b>both</b> <b>instances</b> she voted in the negative, killing the bill. During her tenure, she also chaired the National Conference of Lieutenant Governors, becoming {{the first woman to}} hold that position. In 1982, she was named to the board of regents of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville.|$|E
5|$|From 2012 to 2015, the {{two teams}} competed in the I-40 Cup Series, a season-long, 16-game series between the clubs. Whichever of the two won the most games played between them was {{declared}} the winner and received a trophy cup to keep until the next season. The losing team donated game tickets to a charity selected by the winner. The Sounds won the inaugural 2012 contest (9–7), and Memphis won the 2013 series (7–9). The teams tied the 2014 and 2015 series (both 8–8); the Redbirds retained the title in <b>both</b> <b>instances.</b> The teams discontinued the trophy cup, friendly wager, and promotional references to the Series after 2015.|$|E
5|$|In December 2009, Karthik was {{recalled}} to the ODI team {{during the}} Sri Lankan tour of India after Dhoni was banned {{after the second}} match for two matches because of slow over rates.

5|$|A {{recurring}} plot {{element is}} {{the depiction of}} Kyle as insecure about Jewish traditions and beliefs. Already regarding God as cruel for allowing him to suffer from a life-threatening hemorrhoid while Cartman enjoys a million-dollar inheritance, Kyle became further appalled after being read the story of Job. He also once feared damnation for not having grown up as a Catholic. During <b>both</b> <b>instances,</b> he renounced his affiliation with Judaism, only to have his faith restored by events occurring {{at the end of}} an episode. After watching The Passion of the Christ, a shameful Kyle suddenly felt that Cartman's anti-Semitism was justified, and suggested to angry members of his synagogue that the Jews apologize for the death of Jesus. Kyle's guilt is alleviated when he encounters Mel Gibson, the film's director, and perceives him to be a deranged masochist.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the mid-1930s, Orizaba {{often carried}} {{gold and silver}} bars from Veracruz to New York for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Chase National Bank, or for later {{transshipment}} to London. In October 1933 three short tons (2.7tonnes) of gold bars and coins were shipped on Orizaba for eventual delivery to London, prompting some to believe that gold was being smuggled into Mexico {{to take advantage of}} its policy of not charging duties on gold. In July 1934 Orizaba brought in 16cases of Mexican gold, and in January 1935, 20cases; in <b>both</b> <b>instances,</b> for delivery to Chase National Bank. Twice in 1935, the Ward liner delivered over 1,000bars of silver for the Federal Reserve Bank, bringing 1,390bars in March, and 1,933bars in July. Mexico was not the only place from which Orizaba delivered precious metals. In March 1934, she delivered 12cases of gold—consisting of 84 bars, and worth $1,624,000—from Havana for Chase.|$|E
5|$|During the season, Poulton {{also played}} in the Under-19 interstate tournament during the break in the WNCL, captaining her state. In five innings, she made three half-centuries, with a best of 73 against Queensland in the final, which New South Wales won by five wickets. She was unbeaten {{in the other two}} fifties after opening the batting; New South Wales {{completed}} ten-wicket wins in <b>both</b> <b>instances.</b> Poulton ended the competition with 191 runs at 63.66. She was rewarded with selection in and captaincy of the national Under-19 team during the season and played in two matches against England Under-19s, scoring 13 and 35 as Australia won both matches. At the end of the season, she was selected to lead an Australian Under-23 team to play against the senior England team. Poulton made 15 in her only innings.|$|E

5|$|In {{both the}} campaigns of 1796 and 1800, Napoleon had envisaged the Danube theater {{as the central}} focus of French efforts, but in <b>both</b> <b>instances</b> the Italian theater became the most important. The Aulic Council thought Napoleon would strike in Italy again. Napoleon had other intentions: 210,000 French troops would be {{launched}} eastwards from the camps of Boulogne and would envelop General Mack's exposed Austrian army if it kept marching towards the Black Forest. Meanwhile, Marshal Murat would conduct cavalry screens across the Black Forest to fool the Austrians into thinking that the French were advancing on a direct west-east axis. The main attack in Germany would be supported by French assaults in other theaters: Marshal Masséna would confront Charles in Italy with 50,000 men of the Armée d'Italie, St. Cyr would march to Naples with 20,000 men, and Marshal Brune would patrol Boulogne with 30,000 troops against a possible British invasion.|$|E

5|$|Small {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Trinidad on 11 November 1909, playing against a team chosen by WC Shepherd. Small scored 13 and 0 in the match and bowled two over {{without taking a}} wicket. The following January, Small made his first appearance for Trinidad in the Inter-Colonial Tournament; he scored seven runs in his only innings and took four for 16 in British Guiana's first innings. In the final against Barbados, he took one wicket {{in the game and}} scored 17 and 8 in his two innings. Trinidad won the match. Later that year, Small played against Barbados again, in the final of the next Inter-Colonial Tournament, but had little success in that match, nor in the 1912 tournament when his best score in two games was 15 runs, and he took a total of three wickets. In <b>both</b> <b>instances,</b> Barbados won the tournament.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. There is a {{comprehensive}} body of theory studying updates and schema evolution of knowledge bases, ontologies, and in particular of RDFS. In this paper we turn these ideas into practice by presenting a feasible and practical procedure for updating RDFS. Along the lines of ontology evolution, we treat schema and instance updates separately, showing that RDFS instance updates are not only feasible, but also de-terministic. For RDFS schema update, known to be intractable in the general abstract case, we show that it becomes feasible in real world datasets. We present for <b>both,</b> <b>instance</b> and schema update, simple and feasible algorithms. ...|$|R
5|$|Various {{specific}} cases of animal testing have drawn attention, including <b>both</b> <b>instances</b> of beneficial scientific research, and instances of alleged ethical violations by those performing the tests. The fundamental properties of muscle physiology were determined with work done using frog muscles (including the force generating mechanism of all muscle, the length-tension relationship, and the force-velocity curve), and frogs {{are still the}} preferred model organism due to the long survival of muscles in vitro {{and the possibility of}} isolating intact single-fiber preparations (not possible in other organisms). Modern physical therapy and the understanding and treatment of muscular disorders is based on this work and subsequent work in mice (often engineered to express disease states such as muscular dystrophy). In February 1997 a team at the Roslin Institute in Scotland announced the birth of Dolly the sheep, the first mammal to be cloned from an adult somatic cell.|$|E
5|$|The film's setting, {{which appears}} to be a major city, is never {{identified}} in The Brute Man, but {{it has been suggested that}} it is Manhattan, since that is where House of Horrors took place. Commentators have noted similarities between The Brute Man and other films, including the Charlie Chaplin silent comedy City Lights (1931), and the Universal Pictures horror film Bride of Frankenstein (1935). City Lights, like The Brute Man, included a protagonist (Chaplin's Tramp character) who falls in love with a blind girl and seeks money for an operation to restore her eyesight. Likewise, the scenes between the Creeper and Helen Paige share a similar premise and dialogue as the scenes between Frankenstein's monster and the blind hermit in Bride of Frankenstein. In both films, the protagonists are shunned by society based on their physical appearance, but find companionship in a blind loner who knows nothing about their deformities. In <b>both</b> <b>instances,</b> the protagonist is first drawn to their blind companions by music. The Creeper heard Helen playing the piano, while Frankenstein's monster heard the hermit playing the violin. Commentators have noted other similarities between the two films. For example, the Creeper smashes a mirror after looking at his misshapen face, much like the Monster lashes out at his reflection in a waterfall pool.|$|E
