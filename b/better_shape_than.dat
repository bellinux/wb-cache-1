5|$|The British Army during World War I was {{the largest}} {{military}} force that Britain had put into the field up to that point. On the Western Front, the British Expeditionary Force ended the war as the strongest fighting force, more experienced than the United States Army and its morale was in <b>better</b> <b>shape</b> <b>than</b> the French Army.|$|E
25|$|Armstrong {{retired after}} the Tour in 2005. Ullrich decided to ride {{one or two}} more years. Early reports said Ullrich was in <b>better</b> <b>shape</b> <b>than</b> {{previous}} years and could be ready for his second victory in the Tour. Ullrich finished 115th in the Tour de Romandie on 30 April. However, he injured his knee in the off-season, which could have limited his performance in the 2006 Tour, had he participated (see below).|$|E
25|$|The {{diamond-shaped}} False Cross {{is composed}} of the four stars Delta and Kappa Velorum (δ and κ Vel) and Epsilon and Iota Carinae (ε and ι Car). Although its component stars are not quite as bright {{as those of the}} Southern Cross, it is somewhat larger and <b>better</b> <b>shaped</b> <b>than</b> the Southern Cross, for which it was often mistaken, causing errors in astronavigation. Like the Southern Cross, three of its main four stars are whitish and one orange.|$|R

25|$|With the 1980 {{end of the}} Rock Island, the Regional Transportation Authority {{purchased}} the suburban territory and remaining Rock Island commuter equipment from the estate. LaSalle Street Station was torn down and replaced with the Chicago Stock Exchange building with a small station for commuters retained one block south of the old station. The RTA gradually rebuilt the track and added more new equipment to the service, leaving the property in <b>better</b> <b>shape</b> <b>than</b> {{it was in the}} Rock Island's heyday, albeit with less track. The Rock Island District, as the Rock Island's suburban service is now known, now operates as part of Metra, the Chicago Commuter Rail agency.|$|E
25|$|The {{division}} was subsequently sent to Nimes, France to rebuild, as many divisions mauled on the Eastern Front were. On 1 May 1944 it absorbed men and tanks of the 155th Reserve Panzer Division {{to return to}} its full strength. During this absorption it received 31 Panzer IIIs, 74 Panzer IVs, 20 assault guns, 15 Panther tanks and 200 other vehicles. The division then conducted training exercises up until June of that year. It was reassigned to an area on the Rhone River for a time. It was in <b>better</b> <b>shape</b> <b>than</b> {{many of the other}} divisions in the area, which were refitting, forming, or lacked transportation to move effectively.|$|E
25|$|The region's {{conservative}} social mores, climatic factors, {{and high}} levels of health spending in oil-producing states tend to limit some globally prevalent diseases, such as HIV/AIDS and malaria, but others, such as TB and hepatitis B and C, are more prevalent. The region's advantages are partially offset by the impact of war-related uprooting of populations, overcrowded cities with poor refrigeration and sanitation systems, and a dearth of water, especially clean drinking water. Health care capacity varies considerably within the region, according to the AFMIC typology. Israel and the Arabian Peninsula states minus Yemen are in far <b>better</b> <b>shape</b> <b>than</b> Iraq, Iran, Syria, and most of North Africa. Ninety to 100 percent of the Israeli population and 70 to 90 percent of the Saudi population have good access to health care. Elsewhere, access ranges from less than 40 percent in Yemen to 50 to 70 percent in the smaller Gulf states, Jordan and Tunisia, while most North African states fall into the 40- to-50-percent category.|$|E

50|$|After the war, {{the club}} took the unusual {{decision}} {{to tour the}} United States and Canada. It was Kay's theory that the climate and diet in North America would be extremely beneficial to the players. The punishing schedule of 10 matches {{in less than a}} month meant that the Liverpool squad started the first post-war season in far <b>better</b> physical <b>shape</b> <b>than</b> many of their competitors.|$|R
25|$|Many {{enterprises}} {{were taken}} over by the state or failed, small trade and production shops had to join cooperatives, but only a small proportion of peasant agriculture was made collective (over ten percent of the arable area) by {{the start of the war}} with Germany. Among the industrial installations dismantled and sent east were most of the Białystok textile industry factories. The results of the Soviet economic policies soon resulted in serious difficulties, as shops lacked goods, food was scarce and people were threatened by famine. Nevertheless, the conditions were better under the Soviets than in the German-run General Government. Industry was developed in Lviv and elsewhere and unemployment was officially eliminated by the spring of 1940. The living standards, following the initial collapse, kept gradually improving, many services were free or inexpensive and the poor and people with technical education fared better than under the Polish rule. The cities, of which Lviv and Białystok were particularly well-maintained by the Soviet authorities, were in much <b>better</b> <b>shape</b> <b>than</b> the countryside. The situation was very difficult for the Polish retirees, deprived of their pensions, and for the tens of thousands of war refugees who fled German-occupied Poland and settled in the eastern cities.|$|E
500|$|To {{the left}} of Dog Green sat Dog White, between the Vierville and Les Moulins strongpoints (defending draws D-1 and D-3); and here was a {{different}} story. As a result of earlier mis-landings, and now because of their own mis-landing, the troops of C/116 found themselves alone at Dog White, {{with a handful of}} tanks from the first wave in sight. The smoke from the grass fires covering their advance up the beach, they gained the seawall with few casualties, and were in <b>better</b> <b>shape</b> <b>than</b> any unit on the 116th RCT front so far. Although the 1st Battalion was effectively disarmed of its heavy weapons when D/116 suffered a disastrous landing, the buildup at Dog White continued. C/116 was joined by the 5th Ranger Battalion almost in its entirety. The Ranger commander, recognizing the situation at Dog Green on the run-in, ordered the assault craft to divert into Dog White. Like the C/116, the smoke covered their advance, although the 2nd Rangers were caught out on the right flank of the Ranger's landing. This was where the 116th RCT regimental command group, including the 29th Division assistant commander Brigadier General Norman [...] "Dutch" [...] Cota, was able to land relatively unscathed.|$|E

Though she believed that it was not Madonna's best video, nevertheless it was successful as a release. Christopher Farley from The Washington Post gave another positive review, saying that the singer [...] "appears to be in <b>better</b> <b>shape</b> <b>than</b> many college students, which is crazy" [...] and also complimented her for picking [...] "M.I.A. and Nicki Minaj–and getting them to literally serve as cheerleaders for the Madonna brand." [...] MTV News' Jocelyn Vena described it as [...] "funky, fun and surreal (and almost cartoony)" [...] as well as fun and light-hearted: [...] "Madonna looks like she's having an incredibly fun time throughout the visual, smiling and shimmying her way through this fictional, hyper-fantasy world. Watching the clip, one may wonder what doesn't happen in the video." ...|$|E

For a given triangular mesh of points with arbitrary topology, one cubic triangular Bézier patch surface is constructed. The resulting surfaces have G¹ continuity at the vertex points, but only requires approximate G¹ continuity along the macro-patch boundaries {{so as to}} lower the patch degree. While our scheme cannot generate the surfaces in as high quality as Loop’s sextic scheme, they are of half the polynomial degree, and of far <b>better</b> <b>shape</b> quality <b>than</b> the results of interpolating split domain schemes...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the outlook for the banking industry {{over the next few}} years, focusing on whether the prosperity and tranquility of the 1990 s will continue, or whether the industry faces a return of the banking problems of the 1980 s. Because banks are in much <b>better</b> <b>shape</b> now <b>than</b> in the 1980 s, the industry is unlikely to face the depth of problems suffered in the 1980 s even if the economic environment becomes less favorable.

In 1987 she recorded an album of Cohen songs, Famous Blue Raincoat. Cohen said that she sang backup for his 1980 tour, even though her career {{at the time was}} in much <b>better</b> <b>shape</b> <b>than</b> his. [...] "So this is a real friend", he said.

60|$|There is {{at present}} {{a party of}} Zulu Kaffirs exhibiting at the St. George's Gallery, Hyde Park Corner, London. These noble savages are {{represented}} in a most agreeable manner; they are seen in an elegant theatre, fitted with appropriate scenery of great beauty, and they are described in a very sensible and unpretending lecture, delivered with a modesty which is quite a pattern to all similar exponents. Though extremely ugly, they are much <b>better</b> <b>shaped</b> <b>than</b> such of their predecessors as I have referred to; and they are rather picturesque to the eye, though far from odoriferous to the nose. What a visitor left to his own interpretings and imaginings might suppose these noblemen to be about, when they give vent to that pantomimic expression which is quite settled to be the natural gift of the noble savage, I cannot possibly conceive; for {{it is so much}} too luminous for my personal civilisation that it conveys no idea to my mind beyond a general stamping, ramping, and raving, remarkable (as everything in savage life is) for its dire uniformity. But let us - with the interpreter's assistance, of which I for one stand so much in need - see what the noble savage does in Zulu Kaffirland.|$|R
