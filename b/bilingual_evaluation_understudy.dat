Following (Lapata, 2006), we use the information ordering task as a testbed for evaluating dialogue coherence models. This paper reports findings about the reliability of the information ordering task as applied to dialogues.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{multilingual}} unsupervised Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) task for {{a sample of}} English nouns. Instead of providing manually sensetagged examples for each sense of a polysemous noun, our sense inventory is built up {{on the basis of}} the Europarl parallel corpus. The multilingual setup involves the translations of a given English polysemous noun in five supported languages, viz. Dutch, French, German, Spanish and Italian. The task targets the following goals: (a) the manual creation of a multilingual sense inventory for a lexical sample of English nouns and (b) the evaluation of systems on their ability to disambiguate new occurrences of the selected polysemous nouns. For the creation of the hand-tagged gold standard, all translations of a given polysemous English noun are retrieved in the five languages and clustered by meaning. Systems can participate in 5 <b>bilingual</b> <b>evaluation</b> subtasks (English- Dutch, English- German, etc.) and in a multilingual subtask covering all language pairs. As WSD from cross-lingual evidence is gaining popularity, we believe it is important to create a multilingual gold standard and run cross-lingual WSD benchmark tests. ...|$|R

40|$|Evaluation {{of machine}} {{translation}} {{is an important}} step towards improving MT. One way to evaluate the output of MT is to focus on different types of errors occurring in the translation hypotheses, and to think of possible solutions to fix those errors. An error categorization is a rather beneficent tool that makes it easy to analyze the translation errors and can also be utilized to manually generate post-editing rules to be applied automatically to the product of machine translation. In this work, we define a categorization for the errors occurring in Swedish [...] Persian machine translation by analyzing the errors that occur in three data-sets from two websites: 1177. se, and Linköping municipality. We define three types of monolingual reference free evaluation (MRF), and use two automatic metrics BLEU and TER, to conduct a <b>bilingual</b> <b>evaluation</b> for Swedish-Persian translation. Later on, based on the experience of working with the errors that occur in the corpora, we manually generate automatic post-editing (APE) rules and apply them to the product of machine translation. Three different sets of results are obtained: (1) The results of analyzing MT errors show that the three most common types of errors that occur in the translation hypotheses are mistranslated words, wrong word order, and extra prepositions. These types of errors are placed in semantic and syntactic categories respectively. (2) The results of comparing the correlation between the automatic and manual evaluation show a low correlation between the two evaluations. (3) Lastly, applying the APE rules to the product of machine translation gives an increase in BLEU score on the largest data-set while remaining almost unchanged on the other two data-sets. The results for TER show a better score on one data-set, while the scores on the two other data-sets remain unchanged...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} {{in the era of}} big data use is how to ‘clean’ the vast amount of data, particularly from micro-blog websites like Twitter. Twitter messages, called tweets, are commonly written in ill-forms, including abbreviations, repeated characters, and misspelled words.

There are several existing techniques proposed to solve these issues, however each technique possess some limitations and therefore cannot achieve good overall results. This paper aims to evaluate individual existing statistical normalisation methods and their possible combinations in order to find the best combination that can efficiently clean noisy tweets at the character-level, which contains abbreviations, repeated letters and misspelled words.

This study reviewed the economic-based literature {{with respect to}} open and endovascular treatment of peripheral arterial disease. MethodsThis systematic review included economic analyses of open and endovascular treatment of lower extremity peripheral arterial disease, including claudication and critical limb ischemia. Studies were categorized as model-based, cost-consequences, or econometric cost-analyses. Clinical, financial, and time-based outcomes were examined. ResultsFrom a candidate list of 1351 studies, 19 were appropriate for the review, comprising 3 model-based, 12 cost-consequence, and 4 cost-analyses. Because of the small numbers, claudication and critical limb ischemia studies were analyzed together. There was a trend favoring initial cost-savings with endovascular therapy. Whether this benefit is sustained over time is unknown. We were prevented from drawing cost-efficacy inferences because of a noted lack of standardized patient-centric outcomes, longitudinal data, and reintervention data. ConclusionsThe existing lower extremity arterial revascularization economic literature is inadequate for drawing cost-efficacy conclusions and cannot inform guidelines for open vs endovascular treatment. Overcoming this limitation will require the inclusion of cost (initial and reintervention) and patient-centric outcomes in future studies evaluating lower extremity revascularization technologies.

40|$|Environmental {{education}} is a diverse field, carried out by {{many different types of}} organisations and individuals in a variety of formal and non-formal settings. In this era of accountability environmental educators are increasingly being asked to demonstrate the success of their projects through evaluation. In this thesis, I explore evaluation practice within environmental education in the UK from the perspectives of practitioners and their participants. I used a mixed-methods approach to discover what practitioners and participants feel are the outcomes of environmental education, comparing them with each other and the limited literature on the topic. Practitioners suggested a wide range of different outcomes, which I categorised into outcomes for the environment, for the individual, the wider community and the institution running the project. A particularly diverse range of outcomes for the individual were suggested by practitioners and their participants. Few studies have examined the evaluation practice of environmental education practitioners, but the literature suggests a lack of a culture of evaluation within the sector. Practitioners in my sample report evaluating their projects more frequently than is reported in the literature. However, I used the Kirkpatrick typology of evaluation to categorise the types of evaluation conducted by these practitioners and revealed that much of this is mainly a fairly superficial assessment of how much participants enjoyed the activities.

40|$|When two texts have an {{inclusion}} relation, {{the relationship}} between them is called entailment. The task of mechanically distinguishing such a relation is called recognising textual entailment (RTE), which is basically a kind of semantic analysis. A variety of methods have been proposed for RTE. However, when the previous methods were combined, the performances were not clear. So, we utilized each method as a feature of machine learning, in order to combine methods.

40|$|The vast {{majority}} of deaf schools in China use the oral approach – while internationally there is an increasing recognition of a bilingual approach based on local sign language as the first language and local spoken and written language as the second and supporting language. Science indicates that children exposed to sign language {{at an early stage}} will learn {{in the same way as}} their hearing peers and reach the same cognitive, social psychological development. The first bilingual experimental class was established by Amity Foundation back in 1996 in Nanjing. The SigAm project started 2004 after a period of feasibility studies. It is a three partite cooperative project between the Signo and the local partners. The project covered 5 deaf schools in the Jiangsu province in East China. From 2007 the project expanded to four more schools in the western provinces of Guizhou and Sichuan. Purpose/objective: The purpose of the evaluation is twofold: Findings and recommendations will be used by schools and participating provincial authorities to improve and further develop approaches and methods in <b>bilingual</b> education. The <b>evaluation</b> will also be used by Signo and Amity to discuss the need for follow up and preparation of a new programme proposal. Methodology: The evaluation has used three methods for collecting data and information – document review, interviews and observations. There are several threats to the reliability and validity of findings in such an evaluation. The findings and conclusions should be treated with caution. In other words, we will not be able to present a complete picture of SigAm, but hopefully an important part. Key findings: The project is clearly based on a rights approach to education for deaf children. The objectives of introducing bilingual and bicultural approach to the deaf are based on international conventions. Education is also related to democratization and human rights perspectives. The UN Millennium Development Goals “ensures that children everywhere, boys and girls alike, will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling” provide a basis and rationale for bilingual education. The Department of Basic and Special Education in the Ministry of Education is not yet ready to express a preference for sign languages and recognize Chinese Sign Language as an independent language, but supports a “dynamic” approach including use of flexible methods depending on the needs of the child. The SigAm project is in line with and supports such ongoing reform efforts in China. The project provides children with deaf role models and improves their teachers and parents communication skills. The children are able to access communication and social activities in school and at home and feel happy and confident. There are good reasons and support to conclude that the SigAm project has contributed to introduce and establish the concept and practice of bilingual education for the deaf – not only in a few project schools in Jiangsu Province, but in China. The SigAm project is known among people working in special education for the deaf all over China and the broad representation in the final conference May 2009 is a proof of its widespread reputation. Recommendations: • Prepare a brief and strategic paper describing alternative options for a second phase of the project based on this evaluation and previous discussions. • Future support should seek to address prevailing constraints in systems and include interventions like for instance: o technical assistance to policy reform, o curriculum development, o teacher training and other types of capacity building, o specialized training courses • Future options should be discussed with a broad range of stakeholders in China including CC members, relevant universities and colleges, Norwegian Embassy, as well as Norad/MFA in Norway. Other sources of funding should also be explored. • The possibilities for future university cooperation should be explored based on independent links between Chinese and Norwegian Universities with its own funding. Norwegian scholars should be involved, but focusing on higher level issues, like policy reform, teacher training, capacity building etc. Comments from the organisation: We appreciate the cooperation with Stein-Erik Kruse and Jun Hui Yang. A core value to the Signo Foundation is that the project target group is represented in the management of the project. In this project deaf people have contributed with lectures and guidance and through this they have become key role models and of great value for the project success...|$|R

The system translates official explanations into Spanish Sign Language (LSE: Lengua de Signos Espan¿ola) for Deaf people. The translation system {{is made up of}} a speech recognizer (for decoding the spoken utterance into a word sequence), a natural language translator (for converting a word sequence into a sequence of signs belonging to the sign language), and a 3 D avatar animation module (for playing back the hand movements). Two proposals for natural language translation have been evaluated: a rule-based translation module (that computes sign confidence measures from the word confidence measures obtained in the speech recognition module) and a statistical translation module (in this case, parallel corpora were used for training the statistical model). The best configuration reported 31. 6 % SER (Sign Error Rate) and 0. 5780 BLEU (<b>BiLingual</b> <b>Evaluation</b> <b>Understudy).</b> The paper also {{describes the}} eSIGN 3 D avatar animation module (considering the sign confidence), and the limitations found when implementing a strategy for reducing the delay between the spoken utterance and the sign sequence animation...|$|E
40|$|En col·laboració amb la Universitat de Barcelona (UB) i la Universitat Rovira i Virgili (URV) In recent years, Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has {{achieved}} state-of-the art performance in translating from a language; source language, to another; target language. However, {{many of the}} proposed methods use word embedding techniques to represent a sentence in the source or target language. Character embedding techniques for this task has been suggested to represent the words in a sentence better. Moreover, recent NMT models use attention mechanism where the most relevant words in a source sentence are used to generate a target word. The problem with {{this approach is that}} while some words are translated multiple times, some other words are not translated. To address this problem, coverage model has been integrated into NMT to keep track of already-translated words and focus on the untranslated ones. In this research, we present a new architecture in which we use character embedding for representing the source and target words, and also use coverage model to make certain that all words are translated. We compared our model with the previous models and our model shows comparable improvements. Our model achieves an improvement of 2. 87 BLEU (<b>BiLingual</b> <b>Evaluation</b> <b>Understudy)</b> score over the baseline; attention model, for German-English translation, and 0. 34 BLEU score improvement for Catalan-Spanish translation...|$|E
