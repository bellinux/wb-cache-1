5|$|According to Edward Trollope, {{the oldest}} {{tombstone}} {{in the church}} was from the 13th century; it was faded and illegible when he recorded it in or before 1872. A 14th-century slab, originally for a now-lost effigy, is in the church, and <b>brass</b> <b>plate</b> {{from the same period}} was discovered during the 1853 restoration. Richard Dokke, along with his wife Joanna and son John, are commemorated in a plaque dating to the 1430s, and a plaque to William Harebeter and his wife Elizabeth also dates to the 15th century.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} couple of years, Phillips made music {{compilation}} discs for local businesses such as the local ice rink or cinema, men singing songs for loved ones, children playing an instrument, or even a neighbour’s dog howling along to piano accompaniment. As the record shop and studio took over the business, he had a <b>brass</b> <b>plate</b> made which he put on the wall just outside the front door, and had labels made for the discs, but changed the design of the disc label every year. By 1957, Phillips was recording more and more groups of young men with guitars, basses, washboards and drums, who played skiffle.|$|E

25|$|Other {{works of}} art such as the crowns of light (circular chandeliers) made in cast bronze, dating from the Fatimid-Zirid period (around tenth-early {{eleventh}} century), originally belonged to the furniture of the mosque. These polycandelons, now scattered in various Tunisian museums including Raqqada, consist of three chains supporting a perforated <b>brass</b> <b>plate,</b> which has a central circular ring around which radiate 18 equidistant poles connected by many horseshoe arches and equipped for each of two landmarks flared. The three chains, connected by a suspension ring, are each fixed to the plate by an almond-shaped finial. The crowns of light are marked by Byzantine influence to which the Kairouanese artisan brought the specificities of Islamic decorative repertoire (geometric and floral motifs).|$|E

And so, paan (betel leaf) and pod (areca nut cut into small pieces), the seed of the {{tropical}} palm Areca catechu were generously supplied on all festive occasions. The spices were not mixed with chuno (Quick lime). In fact, in every house a copper or <b>brass</b> <b>plate</b> was always kept ready for a pan-pod party. Whenever a guest arrived at the house, it was customary to offer him this plate with a fresh betel leaf just picked from the vine. A betel nut known as tobak or dumti (Tobacco) was prepared and placed on the <b>brass</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E

500|$|The dining room's {{underwent}} {{an extensive}} remodel in 1898 because of Ellwood's rise to national prominence through his barbed wire partnership with Joseph Glidden. The room was enlarged through {{the addition of}} a semi-circular bay. Beyond the addition, the room was refurnished and redecorated to reflect the Georgian Revival alterations that were occurring on the home's exterior. Elements of Georgian Revival architecture that were incorporated into the Ellwood dining room remodel include, mahogany paneling with dentil molding around the windows and doors, a cornice with Classical details, and brackets. Almost all of the dining room's 1898 furniture and woodwork was custom made by Tobey & Company of Chicago and each piece is affixed with a dated <b>brass</b> <b>plate.</b> The main dining room table and chairs were cast in an early Georgian style and the table has twelve extra leaves which can extend it [...] the length of the room. The dining room's smaller table, situated within the bay addition, was used for Ellwood family breakfasts.|$|E

A circular cast <b>brass</b> <b>plate</b> {{with a red}} background on the smokebox door featured the word [...] "Southern" [...] and the date of manufacture. Bulleid advocated a continental style of numbering, basing this upon his experiences at the French branch of Westinghouse Electric before the First World War, and his tenure in the Railway Operating Division (R.O.D.) during that conflict. The Southern Railway number adapted the UIC classification system where [...] "2" [...] and [...] "1" [...] refer {{to the number of}} un-powered leading and trailing axles respectively, and [...] "C" [...] refers to the number of driving axles, in this case three.

These are the initials of William Bold, {{a member of the}} family owning an estate and house about [...] from the church. The east window has two lights with three trefoils in the decorative stone tracery at the top, set in an arched frame with a hoodmould on the outer wall. [...] Geometric patterns of stained glass, dating from about 1860, decorate the east window. A survey in 1937 by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire also noted a <b>brass</b> <b>plate</b> by the north nave window commemorating the 18th-century bequest of a Catherine Roberts to [...] "two old housekeepers of unblemished character".|$|E
500|$|Briarcliff Farms {{intended}} {{to prove that}} optimal farming practices could be profitable. Law believed that kind treatment would produce better cattle, and was intolerant of animal abuse: [...] "Cruelty to a cow {{is the same as}} cruelty to me, and shall never be permitted on this farm." [...] He knew everyone who lived at the farms, and the farm workers knew the name of each cow (which was on a <b>brass</b> <b>plate</b> {{at the front of the}} cow's stall). The cows were sponged several times a day, and workers wore white cotton suits which were sterilized daily by boiling. Law treated his workers as intelligent co-workers, rather than laborers. Each cow was groomed before milking, and a pail of warm water and a brush would then be used on her sides, flanks and udders. The flank and udder were washed again with a one-percent creolin solution, rinsed and dried. Workers would milk into a fine wire strainer placed over a pail; during milking no talking, laughing, smoking or spitting was permitted, since such behavior was claimed to have a [...] "perceptible effect upon their milk". The workers were required to wash their hands thoroughly after cleaning the udders and before milking each cow. Each worker had a set of towels and washed, cared for and milked 15 or 16 cows. The cattle grazed from early spring until late autumn, and were in the barns only for milking. In 1901, The Trained Nurse and Hospital Review said it doubted that any other large New York-area dairy did this.|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The wide use of wire-reinforced rubber products such as conveyor belts, hose and radial ply tyres has reawakened interest in the parameters affecting the adhesion of rubber to <b>brass</b> <b>plated</b> steel wire. My research work {{is an attempt to}} improve and explain the rubber to metal bonding technology; it is concerned with the effect of rubber compounding ingredients as well as wire surface factors on adhesion. This work pertains to show the role played by two of the recently introduced and widely used bonding systems namely (i) Hexamethylene tetramine-resorcinol system and (ii) the Triazine system (Vulcabond SW) * on the adhesion of the rubber to <b>brass</b> <b>plated</b> steel wire. Different carbon blacks, as well as different accelerators and silica are shown to have a great influence on the amount of rubber adhesion to <b>brass</b> <b>plated</b> steel wire. The state of the wire plating as well as the contamination of its surface affects bonding and these parameters were studied using the scanning electron microscope. XPS techniques are employed to explain the role of some accelerators in the mechanism of bonding rubber to <b>brass</b> <b>plated</b> steel wire. A relationship has been found to exist between bind strength and rubber fracture properties. Because of the widespread use of radial tyres in the automobile industry and in every field in which heavy types of tyres are used, this research considers in detail the phenomena of fatigue and pressure at various temperatures on bond life. Also wire ageing is considered to be very important and to effect the bond between the rubber and the <b>brass</b> <b>plated</b> steel. * Trade name of Vulnax International Ltd...|$|R
