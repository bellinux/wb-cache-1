30|$|Nonwoven cotton battings {{treated with}} boric acid {{have been used}} for many years as fire {{barriers}} in soft furnishings products, especially mattresses ([Wakelyn et al. 2005]). These materials are the least expensive FR barrier materials available on the market, since they usually contain cotton fibers that are procured from textile mills as by-products or waste products. Boric acid catalyzes dehydration reactions of the oxygen-containing fibers and facilitates char formation ([Dombrowski 1996]). When exposed to an open flame, the boric acid decomposes endothermically to release water and cool the flame. The glassy coating formed by the decomposition of boric acid suppresses the release of volatile species from the underlying fuel and acts as an oxygen barrier, thereby preventing further oxidation of volatiles. Because of the low intrinsic toxicity, <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> <b>and</b> <b>borates</b> can be safely used in consumer products ([Toxicological Risks of Selected Flame Retardant Chemicals et al. 2000]).

40|$|Abstract—Boron is an {{important}} micronutrient for plants, but high B levels in soils are often responsible for toxicity effects in plants. It is therefore important to understand reactions that may affect B availability in soils. In this study, Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy was employed to investigate mechanisms of <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> (B(OH) 3) <b>and</b> <b>borate</b> (B(OH) 4) adsorption on hydrous ferric oxide (HFO). On the HFO surface, <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> adsorbs via both physical adsorption (outer-sphere) and ligand exchange (inner-sphere) reactions. Both trigonal (<b>boric</b> <b>acid)</b> <b>and</b> tetrahedral (<b>borate)</b> boron are complexed on the HFO surface, and a mechanism where trigonal <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> in solution reacts to form either trigonal or tetrahedral surface complexes is proposed based upon the spectroscopic results. The presence of outer-sphere <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> complexes can be explained based on the Lewis acidity of the B metal center, and this complex {{has important implications for}} boron transport <b>and</b> availability. Outer-sphere <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> is more likely to leach downward in soils in response to water flow.

40|$|Boron is an {{essential}} element for plants but is toxic in excess. Therefore, plants must adapt to both limiting and excess boron conditions for normal growth. Boron transport in plants is primarily based on three transport mechanisms across the plasma membrane: passive diffusion of <b>boric</b> <b>acid,</b> facilitated diffusion of <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> via channels, <b>and</b> export of <b>borate</b> anion via transporters. Under boron -limiting conditions, <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> channels <b>and</b> <b>borate</b> exporters function in the uptake and translocation of boron to support growth of various plant species.

In addition, borate exporters, such as Arabidopsis BOR 4 and barley Bot 1, function in boron exclusion from tissues and cells under conditions of excess boron. Thus, plants actively regulate intracellular localization and abundance of transport proteins to maintain boron homeostasis.

30|$|Biologically derived and {{synthetic}} biodegradable polymers have attracted considerable attention {{for use as}} solid electrolytes in various fields [10, 11, 12]. Polymer electrolytes, such as polyethylene oxide-salt complexes, polyvinyl alcohol [13], chitosan [14], starch [15] and methyl cellulose [16] are prepared by doping of ionic salt to polymers. These {{are the most common}} SPEs employed in electrochemical devices, wherein ionic conductivity was reached up to 10 − 3  S cm− 1. Pradeep et al. [2] discussed the importance and stability of the naturally derived polymer as an electrolyte in electrochemical device. Hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) is a very important cellulose derivative due to its good viscosimetric, emulsifying, stabilizing, dispersing, and agglutinant properties as well as its high solubility in several organic solvents and water and its ability to form films with desirable mechanical properties. These characteristics make HEC suitable for applications in ink, paper, food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, ceramic, textile, and agricultural products [17] Machado et al. [18] studied HEC with different quantities of glycerol and lithium trifluoromethane sulfonate (LiCF 3 SO 3) salt, which showed ionic conductivity value of 1.07  ×  10 − 5  S cm− 1 at 30  °C. It is of great challenge to prepare proton conducting HEC since acid hydrolysis of intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bonding takes place, thereby losing its film-forming properties. Moreover, HEC is crystalline in nature and addition of plasticizers, cross-linkers and different dopants certainly improves the ionic conducting and stability of polymer electrolyte. It is well known that borax (or sodium tetraborate, Na 2 B 4 O 7) is a good buffer and cross-linker. At lower concentrations, the borax totally dissociates into equivalent amount of <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> <b>and</b> <b>borate</b> ion [19]. Usually <b>borate</b> ions <b>and</b> polymer molecules form complexes which induce electrostatic charges on the polymeric chains. The Na+ ions will have a shielding effect on the charges of polymer chains. [20]. In addition, the hydroxyl groups of HEC form hydrogen bonding with borate ions. Thus, stabilizing the polymer matrix and creating opportunity to add acid into the HEC system. H 3 PO 4 {{has proved to be a}} good proton conductor in poly(ethylenimine) [21], poly(vinyl alcohol) [22] and poly (silamine) [23] chitosan/iota-carrageenan [24]. The source of proton conduction can be obtained by self-ionization and self-dehydration of H 3 PO 4 [25]. H 3 PO 4 also acts as a plasticizer [26]. Addition of H 3 PO 4 may further induce esterification reaction with hydroxyl groups of HEC, but acid hydrolysis of β-glucoside bonds would be minimized in presence of borax.|$|R
30|$|The bait {{consisted}} of sucrose solution (20 & w/w) {{added with a}} toxicant offered in plastic tubes (5  ml and 10  mm diameter) with a plug of non-compacted cotton. It {{is important that the}} plug of cotton is set lightly so as not to dry on the outside, but does not drip when tilted down. This solution has low viscosity which is preferred for urban ant baits, because it does not present a mechanical difficulty for small species to ingest (Baker et al. 1985 Josens et al. 1998; Silverman and Roulston 2001; O’Brien and Hooper-Bui 2005; Medan and Josens 2005).

5000|$|<b>Boric</b> <b>acid,</b> oxides <b>and</b> salts (<b>borates)</b> are {{effective}} wood preservatives and are supplied under numerous brand names throughout the world. One {{of the most}} common compounds used is disodium octaborate tetrahydrate (commonly abbreviated DOT). Borate treated wood is of low toxicity to humans, and does not contain copper or other heavy metals. However, unlike most other preservatives, borate compounds do not become fixed in the wood and can be partially leached out if exposed repeatedly to water that flows away rather than evaporating (evaporation leaves the borate behind so is not a problem). Even though leaching will not normally reduce boron concentrations below effective levels for preventing fungal growth, borates should not be used where they will be exposed to repeated rain, water or ground contact unless the exposed surfaces are treated to repel water. [...] Zinc-borate compounds are less suspectible to leaching than sodium-borate compounds, but are still not recommended for below-ground use unless the timber is first sealed. Recent interest in low toxicity timber for residential use, along with new regulations restricting some wood preservation agents, has resulted in a resurgence of the use of borate treated wood for floor beams and internal structural members. Researchers at CSIRO in Australia have developed organoborates which are much more resistant to leaching, while still providing timber with good protection from termite and fungal attack. The cost of the production of these modified borates will limit their widespread take-up but {{they are likely to be}} suitable for certain niche applications, especially where low mammalian toxicity is of paramount importance.|$|R
40|$|Boron, {{a fairly}} simple atom {{in the first}} row of {{periodic}} table, makes remarkable dative bonds, which have inspired the curiosity of researchers for decades. Boron has three valence electrons and when in compounds the boron atom is often sp 2 hybridized and has a planar structure. An empty p-orbital, which has the capability of accepting an electron pair, makes boron a good Lewis <b>acid</b> <b>and</b> once the lone pair is gained the structure around the boron becomes tetrahedral. While Boron-Nitrogen, B-N dative bonds have been extensively studied throughout the years, other boron dative bonds such as B-O and B-P also have shown remarkable characteristics. Boron-Nitrogen containing compounds such as ammonia borane, metal amidoboranes, and organoboron boron compounds have shown to be promising hydrogen storage materials. These compounds release hydrogen upon heating, which, {{can be used as a}} clean energy source. Thermolysis of amino-boron compounds is an exothermic process. Once the initial hydrogen is released it will gives out enough energy for a self-sustained hydrogen release. But this ongoing exothermic reactions increase the temperature of the system and can even cause breaking of boron-nitrogen bond, forming low molecular weight byproducts such as borone, ammonia and borozine, that can pollute the proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEM fuel cells). This type of technological utility adds to the interest in carrying out studies to understand the B-N bond energies of different boron nitrogen compounds. Knowing the dissociation bond energies for B-N is useful in controlling the reaction temperatures of thermolysis process. Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a powerful form of radiotherapy, which incorporate 10 B-containing compounds into tumor cells, followed by the irradiation of tumor/cancer cells with thermal neutrons. Subsequent to absorbing the neutron, the resulting 11 B is unstable and decays into Li and 4 He, a high-energy reaction, which destroys tumor cells without damaging as many of the surrounding healthy cells as other forms of chemotherapy. The most important requirement for the boron neutron-capture therapy is the high and selective accumulation of boron in tumor cells, where the boron-containing molecule should adhere to both boron and to the targeted cancer cell. Finding boron compounds with high selectivity, water solubility and low toxicity in high concentrations is a major problem in the advancement of treatment using BNCT. Therefore studying of boron binding environments is essential in the field of radiotherapy. Phosphorous, which plays an important role in human body as phosphates is a good example of selective boron binding for treatment of cancer cells. In addition to its part as an essential building block in DNA and RNA and as an energy transporter in the form of nucleoside di- and triphosphate, it contributes strongly to the strength and integrity of the bone skeleton. Bisphosphonates, used as a treatment for diseases like osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis, can be strongly adsorbed to hydroxylapatite crystals. Hydroxylapatite crystals are substances that are found in increased quantities in bone cancer cells. Phosphorous makes dative bonds with boron. With an extended study of the strength of the boron-phosphorous bond strength; bisphosphonates might be used as a boron carrier for boron neutron capture therapy. In addition to phosphorous it has been found that both oxygen and nitrogen containing molecules also acts as selective boron carriers for BNCT. The pharmacological uses of boron compounds have also been known for decades. In animal cells at pH values that are present, almost all-natural boron exists as <b>boric</b> <b>acid,</b> which forms molecular additive compounds with many biological compounds such as, amino <b>and</b> hydroxy <b>acids,</b> nucleotides <b>and</b> carbohydrates through the formation of electron donor-acceptor interactions. Recent findings of boron analogous of amino <b>acids</b> <b>and</b> their derivatives express anti-inflammatory, antineoplastic, and hypolipidemic properties. Most available dietary boron supplements use boron chelated with amino acids or hydroxy acids (citric acid, aspartic acid or glycine) in combination with vitamins. However the molecular structure of these boron chelates is poorly understood. It is essential to understand the dative bond strength of a number of boron containing bonds, including B-N, since this bond strength can govern the possible structures for drug design for various diseases to aide in understanding its function in affected sites. <b>Boric</b> <b>acids</b> <b>and</b> <b>borate</b> anions can be combined with organic compounds to form molecules that contain B-O-C bonds (alcohols <b>and</b> carboxylic <b>acids)</b> so they are capable of forming organic esters. H 3 BO 3 + 3 R(OH) [...] 3 ̆e B(OR) 3 + 3 H 2 O As shown in the equation above, <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> reacts with an primary alcohol R(OH) in a reversible reaction gives out <b>borate</b> di-ester <b>and</b> water molecules. Both <b>boric</b> <b>and</b> boronic <b>acids</b> can form either neutral or anionic esters depending on the pH of the system. Diol binding by boron acids is favored at high pH values, whereas the esterification of boron by hydroxycarboxylic acids is favored at low pH ranges. At high pH values boron acids can also form an anionic, tetrahedral diester with a couple of diols or with a diol and a relevant divalent ligand. The reversible reaction of esterification of boronic acids has been used in the health industry for developing blood sugar monitoring techniques for diabetics and the same reaction with <b>boric</b> <b>acid</b> is used in the study of plant cell wall biosynthesis where the borate diol cross-linked to connect two side chains of Rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II) macromolecule which controls the growth of the plant cell wall. Boron-based glucose receptors for incorporation as sensors in blood sugar monitors for diabetics have developed during the past two decades. The relative affinity of boronates for diols in most carbohydrates follows the order of cis- 1, 2 -diol 3 ̆e cis- 1, 3 - diol 3 ̆e 3 ̆e trans- 1, 2 diol. Therefore it is clear that certain monosaccharides have an intrinsically higher affinity for boron acids. It has been found that the boron-binding site for a monosaccharide depends on both the type of boron <b>acid</b> <b>and</b> the type of monosaccharide. For an example, boronates has the ability to bind to the 1, 2 -diol and trans- 4, 6 - diol of glucose in its hexopyranoside form, boronic acid has an affinity for the furanoside form of free hexoes 18 and galactopyranoside has an affinity for cis- 3, 4 -diol and trans- 4, 6 -diol. Rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II) is a structurally complex pectic polysaccharide, which is conserved in the plant cell wall despite the evolutionary variation of plants. RG-II contains homogalacturonan backbone composed of at least eight 1 [...] 3 ̆e 4 linked alpha-d-galacturonic acid residues. Four different complex oligo glycosyl side-chains named side chain A, side chain B, side chain C and side chain D that contain twelve different glycosyl residues are attached to this backbone. RG-II may exist as a dimmer, which contributes to the strength of the plant cell wall. Covalently cross-linking two side chains by a borate diester lead to RG-II dimerization. The boron needed for the borate binding is absorbed by the plant from the soil solution in the form of either <b>boric</b> or borate <b>acids.</b> The boro-diester reaction occurs in between two alpha-d-apoise (3 -C-hydroxymethyl-D-erythrose) monomers in the side chain A of RG-II structure. The borate esterification is believed to be happened in cis- 2, 3 diol position. Structure of RG-II and its functions has been studied for more than four decades; still the structure and the functions of RG-II are not completely understood. Therefore the study of borate cross-linking carbohydrates can give some insights in to this complex macromolecule. Boron is acts as a Lewis acid abduct over a range of fields. The comparable size of boron atom to carbon atom and the strength of dative bonds and the ability to undergo reversible reactions makes a boron a good candidate for the fields of energy, biology, medicine and plant cell biology. As a whole, study of boron binding environments can give insights for many unanswered questions...|$|R
