5|$|The {{campaign}} {{was not entirely}} <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> <b>for</b> Vienna. At Haslach, Johann von Klenau arranged his 25,000infantry and cavalry in a prime defensive position and, on 11 October, the overly confident General of Division Pierre Dupont de l'Étang attacked Klenau's force with fewer than 8,000men. The French lost 1,500men killed and wounded. Aside from taking the Imperial Eagles and guidons of the 15th and 17th Dragoons, Klenau's force also captured 900men, 11guns and 18 ammunition wagons.|$|E

Þrymr sees Loki, and asks what could be amiss among the Æsir and the elves; why is Loki alone in Jötunheimr? Loki responds that he has <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> <b>for</b> both the elves and the Æsir—that Thor's hammer, Mjöllnir, is gone.

Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling, away from Jötunheimr and back to the court of the gods.|$|E
5|$|Later on that day, a deserter {{from the}} Persian fleet, a Greek called Scyllias, swam into the Allied camp. He brought <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> <b>for</b> the Allies — whilst {{most of the}} Persian fleet was {{undergoing}} repairs, the Persians had detached 200 seaworthy ships to sail around the outer coast of Euboea, to block the escape route of the Allied fleet. The Persians {{did not want to}} attack the Allies yet, because they thought the Allies would simply flee, and so they sought to trap them. The Allies resolved to go and meet this detachment, to prevent being trapped, though they planned to leave by nightfall to prevent the Persians becoming aware of their plans.|$|E

Nowhere is this more evident than at Castle Coole in Northern Ireland. The entire servant's quarters were put underground into cellars, lit only by windows at the bottom of grated pits. The only means of approach was through a single underground tunnel, the entrance of which was concealed by the brow of a landscaped hill some distance from the house.|$|E

25|$|Mussolini's {{entry into}} the war was at least <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> <b>for</b> the United Kingdom, as the Regia Marina would now oppose them in Mediterranean waters. Italian armies in Libya and East Africa could also {{potentially}} have knocked British troops completely out of Egypt, having half a million men in Africa compared to the United Kingdom's fifty thousand. However, British troops took the initiative in Africa while Italy was still having trouble pacifying Ethiopia and General Wavell kept up a constantly moving front of raids on Italian positions {{that proved to be}} successful. On 14 June a successful surprise attack was made on Fort Capuzzo by the British, though it was not meant as a permanent gain as the British were using far more mobile tactics at the time. By mid-September, casualty listings indicate that Italy had lost 3,000 troops where the United Kingdom had only lost slightly over 490, despite Italy's land numbers and air superiority at the time.|$|E

40|$|Breaking <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> is {{a complex}} and {{frequent}} clinical task for physicians working in oncology. It can {{have a negative impact}} on patients and their relatives who are often present during breaking <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> consultations. Many factors influence how the delivery of <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> will be experienced especially the communication skills used by physicians. A three-phase process (post-delivery phase, delivery phase, pre-delivery phase) has been developed to help physician to handle this task more effectively. Communication skills and specific breaking <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> training programs are both necessary and effective. A recent study conducted in Belgium has shown their impact on the time allocated to each of the three phases of this process, on the communication skills used, on the inclusion of the relative in the consultation and on physicians' physiological arousal. These results underscore the importance of promoting intensive communication skills and breaking <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> training programs <b>for</b> health care professionals.
