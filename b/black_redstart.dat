Exceptions to this are the birds, many of which migrate from the warmer parts of India to spend the summer in Ladakh.

Many species of finches, robins, redstarts (like the <b>black</b> <b>redstart),</b> and the hoopoe are common in summer. The brown-headed gull is seen in summer on the river Indus and on some lakes of the Changthang. Resident water-birds include the brahminy duck also known as the ruddy sheldrake and the bar-headed goose. The black-necked crane, a rare species found scattered in the Tibetan plateau, is also found in parts of Ladakh.

40|$|Gene flow between {{closely related}} species is not always impeded by hybrid inviability or {{sterility}} but may be limited by behavioural or ecological factors. European common redstarts, Phoenicurus phoenicurus, and <b>black</b> <b>redstarts,</b> P. ochruros, are insectivorous passerine bird species which regularly interbreed in the wild and produce viable and fertile progeny. Yet, the isolation barriers, which prevent extensive gene flow between these distinct species, are unknown. I studied prey-handling time and efficiency in both species and the F- 1 - hybrids incaptivity. All birds changed prey-handling mode from a single pick to more complex behaviour with increasing prey length and their handling time was a positive function of prey length. Common redstarts tended to handle their prey quicker than <b>black</b> <b>redstarts.</b> Hybrids appeared to be intermediate. However, individual differences were significant, but group membership was not. Handling efficiency decreased with increasing prey length and was determined by individual and family effects. Hybrid females handled their prey as efficient as hybrid males. Small differences in beak morphology could not explain individual differences in prey-handling behaviour. The {{results of this study}} suggest that prey-handling in F- 1 -hybrids is not a postzygotic barrier which prevent gene flow between common and <b>black</b> <b>redstarts</b> in the wild...|$|R
40|$|Competition elevates plasma {{testosterone}} in a {{wide variety}} of vertebrates, including humans. The ‘challenge hypothesis’ proposes that seasonal peaks in testosterone during breeding are caused by social challenges from other males. However, during experimentally induced male–male conflicts, testosterone increases only in a minority of songbird species tested so far. Why is this so? Comparative evidence suggests that species with a short breeding season may not elevate testosterone levels during territory defence. These species may even be limited in their physiological capability to increase testosterone levels, which can be tested by injecting birds with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). We studied two populations of <b>black</b> <b>redstarts</b> that differ in breeding altitude, morphology and the length of their breeding season. Unexpectedly, males of neither population increased testosterone in response to a simulated territorial intrusion, but injections with GnRH resulted in a major elevation of testosterone. Thus, <b>black</b> <b>redstarts</b> would have been capable of mounting a testosterone response during the male–male challenge. Our data show, for the first time, that the absence of an androgen response to male–male challenges is not owing to physiological limitations to increase testosterone. Furthermore, in contrast to comparative evidence between species, populations of <b>black</b> <b>redstarts</b> with a long breeding season do not show the expected elevation in testosterone during male–male challenges...|$|R
40|$|Testosterone {{has been}} {{suggested}} {{to be involved in}} the regulation of male territorial behavior. For example, seasonal peaks in testosterone typically coincide with periods of intense competition between males for territories and mating partners. However, some species also express territorial behavior outside a breeding context when testosterone levels are low and, thus, the degree to which testosterone facilitates territorial behavior in these species is not well understood. We studied territorial behavior and its neuroendocrine correlates in male <b>black</b> <b>redstarts.</b> <b>Black</b> <b>redstarts</b> defend territories in spring during the breeding period, but also in the fall outside a reproductive context when testosterone levels are low. In the present study we assessed if song output and structure remain stable across life-cycle stages. Furthermore, we assessed if brain anatomy may give insight into the role of testosterone in the regulation of territorial behavior in <b>black</b> <b>redstarts.</b> We found that males sang spontaneously at a high rate during the nonbreeding period when testosterone levels were low; however the trill-like components of spontaneously produced song contained less repetitive elements during nonbreeding than during breeding. This higher number of repetitive elements in trills did not, however, correlate with a larger song control nucleus HVC during breeding. However, males expressed more aromatase mRNA in the preoptic area – a brain nucleus important for sexual and aggressive behavior – during breeding than during nonbreeding. In combination with our previous studies on <b>black</b> <b>redstarts</b> our results suggest that territorial behavior in this species only partly depends on sex steroids: spontaneous song output, seasonal variation in trills and non-vocal territorial behavior in response to a simulated territorial intruder seem to be independent of sex steroids. However, context-dependent song during breeding may be facilitated by testosterone – potentially by conversion of testosterone to estradiol in the preoptic area...|$|R
2500|$|Industrial {{brownfield}} sites can {{be valuable}} ecosystems, supporting rare species of plants, animals and invertebrates. [...] Increasingly {{in demand for}} redevelopment, these habitats are under threat. [...] "Brown roofs", also known as [...] "biodiverse roofs", can partly mitigate this loss of habitat by covering the flat roofs of new developments {{with a layer of}} locally sourced material. [...] Construction techniques for brown roofs are typically similar to those used to create flat green roofs, the main difference being the choice of growing medium (usually locally sourced rubble, gravel, soil, etc...) to meet a specific biodiversity objective. In Switzerland, it is common to use alluvial gravels from the foundations; in London, a mix of brick rubble and some concrete has been used. [...] The original idea was to allow the roofs to self-colonise with plants, but they are sometimes seeded to increase their biodiversity potential in the short term. Such practices are derided by purists. The roofs are colonised by spiders and insects (many of which are becoming extremely rare in the UK as such sites are developed) and provide a feeding site for insectivorous birds.

40|$|Testosterone {{plays an}} {{important}} role in territorial behavior of many male vertebrates and the Challenge Hypothesis has been suggested to explain differences in testosterone concentrations between males. For socially monogamous birds, the challenge hypothesis predicts that testosterone should increase during male–male interactions. To test this, simulated territorial intrusion (STI) experiments have been conducted, but only about a third of all bird species investigated so far show the expected increase in testosterone. Previous studies have shown that male <b>black</b> <b>redstarts</b> (Phoenicurus ochruros) do not increase testosterone during STIs or short-term male–male challenges. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether <b>black</b> <b>redstarts</b> modulate testosterone in an experimentally induced longer-term unstable social situation. We created social instability by removing males from their territories and compared the behavior and testosterone concentrations of replacement males and neighbors with those of control areas. Testosterone levels did not differ among replacement males, neighbors and control males. Injections with GnRH resulted in elevation of testosterone in all groups, suggesting that all males were capable of increasing testosterone. We found no difference in the behavioral response to STIs between control and replacement males. Furthermore, there was no difference in testosterone levels between replacement males that had expanded their territory and new-coming males. In combination with prior work these data suggest that testosterone is not modulated by male–male interactions in <b>black</b> <b>redstarts</b> and that testosterone plays only a minor role in territorial behavior. We suggest that territorial behavior in species that are territorial throughout most of their annual life-cycle may be decoupled from testosterone...|$|R

40|$|In many {{vertebrates}} testosterone increases during aggressive {{interactions and}} the surges in this hormone {{may be responsible}} for the winner effect. So far studies on this relationship have been done in captivity only, because simulating a winning situation for a territory owner in the field is difficult. However, an increasing number of studies show that territorial aggression is not necessarily accompanied by elevated testosterone after a single simulated territorial intrusion (STI) and therefore it has been proposed that STIs may even create a losing experience. We examined whether free-living male <b>black</b> <b>redstarts</b> (Phoenicurus ochruros) show changes in androgens, corticosterone and behavior following repeated STIs of high or low intensity and in contrast to being challenged only once. Repeated intrusions had no influence on androgen and corticosterone levels regardless of intrusion intensity. In contrast, the behavioral response changed over days depending on the intensity of the intrusion. Only birds challenged with high-level intruders approached the decoy significantly faster during the third intrusion than during the first one, stayed closer to the decoy, and sang more songs than males challenged with low-level intruders. Thus, although <b>black</b> <b>redstarts</b> reacted differently to STIs varying in frequency and intensity, these behavioral differences were not reflected in androgen or corticosterone levels. Our data show that it is unlikely that STIs induce a losing experience. Furthermore, they indicate that a hormonal effect of winning an encounter may not be universal in vertebrates and may depend on the ecological or life-history context...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Many {{studies in}} {{behavioural}} endocrinology attempt to link territorial aggression with testosterone, but the exact relationship between testosterone and territorial behaviour {{is still unclear}} and may depend on the ecology of a species. The degree to which testosterone facilitates territorial behaviour is particularly little understood in species that defend territories during breeding and outside the breeding season, when plasma levels of testosterone are low. Here we suggest that species that defend territories in contexts other than reproduction may have lost the direct regulation of territorial behaviour by androgens even during the breeding season. In such species, only those components of breeding territoriality that function simultaneously as sexually selected signals may be under control of sex steroids. Results: We investigated <b>black</b> <b>redstarts</b> (Phoenicurus ochruros), a species that shows periods of territoriality within {{and outside of the}} breeding season. We treated territorial males with an anti-androgen and an aromatase inhibitor during the breeding season to block both the direct and indirect effects of testosterone. Three and ten days after the treatment, implanted males were challenged with a simulated territorial intrusion. The treatment did not reduce the overall territorial response, but it changed the emphasis of territoriality: experimental males invested more in behaviours addressed directly towards the intruder, whereas placebo-treated males put most effort into their vocal response, a component of territoriality that may be primarily directed towards their mating partner rather than the male opponent. Conclusions: In combination with previous findings, these data suggest that overall territoriality may be decoupled from testosterone in male <b>black</b> <b>redstarts.</b> However, high levels of testosterone during breeding may facilitate-context dependent changes in song...|$|R

50|$|Hiddensee is {{especially}} {{well known for}} its many breeding birds. The briars are home to wheatear, lesser whitethroat, whitethroat, red-backed shrike, skylark, yellowhammer and icterine warbler; the Dornbusch Forest to chaffinch, song thrush, blackcap, wood warbler, great spotted woodpecker and wood pigeon. Sand martins and <b>black</b> <b>redstarts</b> nest on the cliff slopes, the redstarts often using abandoned martin holes. Ravens also breed on the cliffs {{in the vicinity of}} the Klausner. The wren and the rosefinch prefer the vegetated slopes on the Hucke. The prominent uplands of the Dornbusch are of great importance to migrating birds as an orientation point. On the outer coastline, after strong northwest storms in autumn and winter, Nordic ducks, petrels and shearwaters, and auks are occasionally blown ashore here. For example, there are records of Leach's storm petrel (one bird on 31 December 1961 and one on 17 November 1977), king eider (spring 1901 and 7 to 17 December 1988), Razorbills (e.g. around 20 examples on 1 December 1852) and many others. The sunny slopes attract Mediterranean species; confirmed spots include alpine swift, bee-eater, blue rock thrush und hoopoe.|$|R
40|$|During migration, birds {{spend more}} than 80 % of the time at {{stopover}} sites to rest and refuel before and after crossing ecological barriers such as deserts or seas. Since stopover has intrinsic costs in terms of energy and time, birds should try to minimize its duration, which {{is dependent on the}} combined effects of environmental factors, endogenous programmes, and physiological conditions. Previous studies on long-distance migrants caught after crossing an ecological barrier have indicated that body condition strongly influences the decision whether to prolong stopover or resume migration, with lean birds staying longer than fat birds. In short-distance migrants, evidence is still scarce regarding a determinant role for physiological condition in stopover behaviour after crossing an ecological barrier. Here, we studied whether migratory restlessness (Zugunruhe) at a stopover site is dependent on physiological condition in three European short-distance migratory passerines: <b>black</b> <b>redstarts,</b> European robins, and European stonechats. In all species, an integrated measure of condition based on body mass, amount of subcutaneous fat, and thickness of pectoral muscles predicted the intensity of Zugunruhe. Overall, our results confirmed the importance of energy reserves in determining stopover duration, illustrating similar stopover strategies in short- and long-distancemigrants...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{describe}} an approach {{based on an}} individual's hormonal reactive scope to study short-term effects of hormones on behavior. The control of territorial aggression has been traditionally linked to testosterone. Males of some vertebrate species show an increase in testosterone during territorial interactions and implantation studies suggest that such an increase in testosterone enhances the intensity and persistence of aggression. Here, we tested whether a short-term maximum release of testosterone – based on an individual's hormonal reactive scope – affects the intensity or persistence of territorial aggression in male <b>black</b> <b>redstarts,</b> a bird species in which testosterone does not increase during territorial encounters. An injection with gonadotropin-releasing-hormone (GnRH) induced a physiological peak in plasma testosterone that was specific for each individual (= individual reactive scope). However, such short-term surges in an individual's testosterone concentration {{did not affect the}} intensity or persistence of aggression. In conclusion, this study demonstrated (1) that a species that naturally does not increase testosterone during male–male encounters would not benefit from such an increase in terms of being more aggressive, (2) that behavioral studies using GnRH-injections represent a promising approach to study species differences in androgen responsiveness, and (3) that injections of releasing or tropic hormones in general may be a suitable approach to study short-term influences of hormones on behavior. These injections effectively mimic the potential short-term changes in hormones that can occur in the real life of individuals and enable us to study the effects of hormonal changes on behavior or other traits within an ecological and evolutionary framework...|$|R

50|$|The {{white stork}} breeds in open {{farmland}} areas {{with access to}} marshy wetlands, building a large stick nest in trees, on buildings, or on purpose-built man-made platforms. Each nest is 1 - 2 m in depth, 0.8 - 1.5 m in diameter, and 60 - 250 kg in weight. Nests are built in loose colonies. Not persecuted as it {{is viewed as a}} good omen, it often nests close to human habitation; in southern Europe, nests can be seen on churches and other buildings. The nest is typically used year after year especially by older males. The males arrive earlier in the season and choose the nests. Larger nests are associated with greater numbers of young successfully fledged, and appear to be sought after. Nest change is often related to a change in the pairing and failure to raise young the previous year, and younger birds are more likely to change nesting sites. Although a pair may be found to occupy a nest, partners may change several times during the early stages and breeding activities begin only after a stable pairing is achieved.Several bird species often nest within the large nests of the white stork. Regular occupants are house sparrows, tree sparrows, and common starlings; less common residents include Eurasian kestrels, little owls, European rollers, white wagtails, <b>black</b> <b>redstarts,</b> Eurasian jackdaws, and Spanish sparrows. Paired birds greet by engaging in up-down and head-shaking crouch displays, and clattering the beak while throwing back the head. Pairs copulate frequently throughout the month before eggs are laid. High-frequency pair copulation is usually associated with sperm competition and high frequency of extra-pair copulation; however, extra-pair copulation is infrequent in white storks.|$|R
