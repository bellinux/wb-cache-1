50|$|When the vasectomy is complete, sperm cannot {{exit the}} body through the penis. Sperm are still {{produced}} by the testicles, but they are soon broken down and absorbed by the body. Much fluid content is absorbed by membranes in the epididymis, and much solid content is broken down by the responding macrophages and reabsorbed via the blood stream. Sperm is matured in the epididymis {{for about a month}} before leaving the testicles. After vasectomy, the membranes must increase in size to absorb and store more fluid; this triggering of the immune system causes more macrophages to be recruited to break down and reabsorb more solid content. Within one year after vasectomy, sixty to seventy per cent of vasectomized men develop antisperm antibodies. In some cases, vasitis nodosa, a benign proliferation of the ductular epithelium, can also result. The accumulation of sperm increases pressure in the vas deferens and epididymis. The entry of the sperm into the scrotum can cause sperm granulomas to be formed by the body to contain and absorb the sperm which the body will treat as a foreign <b>biological</b> <b>substance</b> (much like a virus or bacterium).|$|E

50|$|Urea was {{crystallized}} {{and identified}} between 1797 and 1808. Urea was hypothesized {{to be the}} source of urinary ammonia during this time and was confirmed in 1817. It was hypothesized that excess urea may lead to specific disorders. Later in 1821, it was confirmed that the body did produce urea and that it was excreted by the kidneys. In 1827, urea was first synthesized in the lab, confirming the composition of urea and making it the first <b>biological</b> <b>substance</b> synthesized. In 1856, urea was produced in vitro via oxidation of proteins. Remarkably, it was in 1850 that Thomas Dutrochet seeded the idea of dialysis with the discovery of separating smaller molecules from larger molecules through a semipermeable membrane. It was in 1829 and 1831 when convincing proof was obtained that in certain patients, blood urea was elevated. They also suggested that harm may be caused by this. Later research suggested that major neurological disorders like coma and convulsions did not correlate with physical findings which included generalized edema of the brain. This suggested that uremia was a form of blood poisoning. In 1851, E.T. Frerich described clinical uremic syndrome and suggested that a toxicity was the mechanism of its cause. It was in 1856 that J. Picard developed a sensitive method to reproducibly measure blood urea. He was able to detect a 40% decrease of urea concentration between the renal artery and the renal vein. This work solidified the fact that renal failure coincided with an increase in blood urea. It was J. Picard with E.T. Frerich's work that made the term uremia popular.|$|E
40|$|Methods {{to obtain}} nucleic acid ligands that photocrosslink to target {{molecules}} {{associated with a}} disease state are provided. The methods presented are variations on the photoSELEX methods for obtaining nucleic acid ligands. In one method, a candidate mixture of photocrosslinkable nucleic acids is contacted with a <b>biological</b> <b>substance</b> obtained from a source associated with a disease state suspected of containing a target molecule to form nucleic acid-target molecule complexes, the complexes are irradiated to form crosslinked complexes, the photocrosslinked complexes are partitioned from {{the remainder of the}} candidate mixture; and the nucleic acid ligands that photocrosslink to molecule are retained. These nucleic acids are then contacted with a second <b>biological</b> <b>substance</b> of the same type as the first, but obtained from a source not associated with a disease state. This removes nucleic acids with affinity to molecules that are not associated with the disease state. In another method, photocrosslinkable nucleic acids are not incorporated in the initial candidate mixture, but rather are incorporated in an enriched candidate mixture obtained by contacting a <b>biological</b> <b>substance</b> associated with a disease state containing a target molecule to form nucleic acid-target molecule complexes, partitioning the complexes away from the candidate mixture.
