5|$|The first {{published}} account appeared in 1888, written by Gustav Bruhl. The German ethnologist and naturalist Karl Sapper described Stela1 in 1894 after {{he saw it}} <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> he was travelling. Max Vollmberg, a German artist, drew Stela 1 and noted some other monuments, which attracted the interest of Walter Lehmann.|$|E
5|$|There is also {{a fallen}} {{standing}} stone known as the Broad Stone which measures 2 metres (6.6 feet) in length and which lies <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> about 1.5kilometres (0.9 miles) {{to the west of}} the Nine Stones. As it was recorded in the 19th century it measured 3 metres (10 feet) in length, 2 metres (6 and a half feet) in breadth, and 0.6 metres (2 feet) in thickness. The monument was protected from passing cars by several bollards which were later removed by the highways authority, prompting statements of concern that the stone was unprotected in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{stone was}} already in a ruined state when Rogberg {{depicted}} the stone in 1763. Rogberg noted {{that it had been}} used as a bridge across a brook and because of this the runes had been worn down so much that most of them were virtually illegible, a statement that is contradicted by later depictions. Since the runestone had passed unnoticed by the runologists of the 17th century, it is likely that it was used as a bridge. In a traveller's journal written in 1792 by Hilfeling, the bottom part of the stone is depicted for the first time, though the artist {{does not appear to have}} realised that the two parts belonged together. In 1822, Liljegren arrived to depict it. A surviving yet unsigned drawing is attributed to Liljegren (see illustration). In 1922, the runologist Kinander learnt from a local farmer that some 40 years earlier, the runestone had been seen walled into a bridge that was part of the country road, and the inscription had been upwards. Someone had decided to remove the runestone from the bridge and put it <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> Kinander wanted to see the stone and was shown a large worn down stone in the garden of Eriksstad. However, according to Kinander it was not possible to find any remaining runes on what was supposed to be the runestone.|$|E

5|$|The British had {{determined}} the Tug Argan gap {{the best possible}} place to make a stand out of the three roadways, and also the most likely invasion route, and thus positioned {{the bulk of the}} army around it. On the British right, to the north of Tug Argan, were three companies of the 3/15 Punjab Regiment, set upon a group of west-facing strongpoints overlooking the rough wilderness that lay <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> South of them lay the gap itself, manned by a contingent of Rhodesian troops. They sat upon a line of small hills, named from north to south Black, Knobbly, Mill, Observation, and Castle Hills. These hills, positioned in a row with 2,000–2,500 yard gaps in between, housed machine-gun nests surrounded with light rings of barbed wire and served as the Rhodesians' defensive strongholds and the main defense for the British of the pass. On the British left were another group of Indian troops, located upon the aptly named 'Punjab Ridge' facing directly to the south. Unfortunately for the British, the front was too wide for the troops available, and the gaps between hills too large, leaving the defenses prone to infiltration. Also, due to the hills being in a single line, the position lacked depth. Meanwhile, De Simone, arriving {{at the site of the}} impending battle on 10 August, set his forces directly opposite the British positions. On the left, II Brigade prepared to advance through the wilderness towards the Punjab troops in the north. In the Italian center, XIV Brigade faced the Rhodesian hilltop positions within the pass, and XV Brigade looked north towards Punjab Ridge on the Italian right. Behind them were XIII Brigade and the armored vehicles.|$|E

25|$|The temple, {{which is}} {{relatively}} narrow, has an unusual design. It is 41.5 metres long and 14.2 metres wide, and is situated <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> that descends from the forum to the Aïn Doura Bath. The temple {{is associated with}} a triumphal arch over the road. The temple can be accessed via a semi-circular staircase; in each corner of the courtyard in front of the staircase is a reservoir for rain water. The cella inside the sanctuary features six lateral niches which are designed to hold the bases of statues of Apollo, Liber, Neptune, Mercury and of two other gods that can no longer be identified.|$|E
25|$|Cristobal de Ovalle, {{seeing that}} he would be cut off from the town, took up a new {{position}} covering the town gates, whilst his cavalry threatened the English flank and rear under cover of a herd of cattle. Carleill however placed his pikemen and musketeers on every side, so that the Spanish were driven back and the cattle simply ran into the jungle. With both columns still advancing they received the fire of the Spanish guns at very close quarters. An ambuscade of Spanish musketeers <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> had no better success as these were quickly driven back by English fire. Within half an hour, the landing party had reached the western walls of Santo Domingo, and the majority of the Spanish troops and militia were in flight.|$|E
25|$|The {{footpath}} rejoins the trackbed {{briefly at}} Low Sikes, {{where there was}} a level crossing over the Ramsgill to Lofthouse road. Lofthouse station was to the south of Lofthouse, sandwiched between the road and the river. The railway crossed the river on a bridge <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> bridge, and turned north. There is a picnic spot beside the southern portal of the tunnel. After a short distance, both the river and trackbed turn to the west, to reach Scar Village, where there is another picnic spot and a car park. The railway followed the most northerly of the two tracks at this point. Another track down to the weirs follows the course of one of the zig-zag tracks across the valley. A footpath crosses the dam to {{the north side of the}} lake, where the incline to the quarry is still clearly visible. Another footpath follows the trackbed along the southern edge of Scar House Reservoir, to reach Angram dam. The course of the railway is clearly visible on the modern 1:25,000 Ordnance Survey map for almost the entire length of the railway.|$|E

25|$|Beyond {{this point}} the area is at present geologically less stable. This {{instability}} is presently {{in the course of}} being corrected with a circa £100M project co-ordinated by Telford & Wrekin District Council, repairs intended to safeguard the Ironbridge Gorge World Heritage site for the next 100 years, although these repairs are not designed to cope with the extra loads imposed by the reinstatement of the railway through the Gorge civil engineering consultants opine that these additional loads are insignificant in relation to those to be carried by the present design. At present a road occupies the route of the railway formation for a distance at Jackfield built to replace the original road damaged {{as a result of the}} 1954 land instability. At this point utility services for the area are carried on runners <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> as the instability makes it impossible to maintain them underground. For all these reasons, reopening is not being actively pursued by the SVR itself, particularly since recovery from the effects of the 2007 floods damage will take time. The promoters recognise that investment for any extension will need to come from outside sources since the SVR feels any funds it has are required for improvements to existing visitor and staff facilities in order to achieve the standards expected nowadays.|$|E
25|$|Major Remington then {{ordered his}} squad {{to charge the}} Confederate force, which Dagwell had just told him must be an entire brigade of Confederate cavalry and had {{correctly}} estimated as being a minimum of 2,000 men. The advance Confederates broke {{into the woods and}} Dagwell followed, only to soon find that he was alone. When he came out to the point the New Yorkers had formed their line, he found only five Union men but also saw several dead and wounded Confederates, including a dead Confederate major <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> Major John H. Whitaker, commander of the 1st North Carolina Cavalry was killed during the action. Sergeant Charles A. Hartwell stated that the New Yorkers killed 5 Confederates and took 14 prisoners in the initial action. Hartwell soon found himself with about a dozen men, including Major Remington, cut off from the other Union troops. Remington and a few others, including Sergeant H. O. Morris, in the face of overwhelming numbers, had retreated from the nearby hill to which Remington had moved most of the men after their initial charge. When he saw the Union movement, Hampton thought they were trying to position themselves to attack the rear of his force and sent a squadron to outflank them, virtually surrounding the majority of the Union men. Sergeant Morris shot a Confederate officer who assaulted Major Remington during the melee that ensued during the fight for escape of the New Yorkers not trapped on the hill.|$|E
500|$|The inquest in August 1971 was {{not able}} to {{establish}} the exact sequence of events. [...] It was established that all three were shot at very close range, probably in a line. All had been drinking, and Joseph was found to be severely intoxicated. The jury was told that the three were probably shot whilst relieving themselves <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> The coroner commented: [...] "You may think that this was not only murder, but one of the vilest crimes ever heard of in living memory". The bodies were heaped {{on top of each other}} with two beer glasses lying near to them. After failing to return to their barracks by 18:30 the three were listed as AWOL. Their bodies were found by children at 21:30.|$|E

500|$|During {{the night}} of 4/5 November 1950, the Chinese and North Koreans mounted a {{full-scale}} assault on US 24th Infantry Division. Before dawn, US 19 RCT had become heavily engaged, and was pushed back nearly [...] The Chinese force turned west to advance between the Taeryong and Chongchon rivers, threatening {{the rear of the}} 27th British Commonwealth Brigade by cutting the Pakchon–Sinanju road. The previous afternoon a patrol from the Middlesex had clashed with a large Chinese patrol [...] to the north-east and suffered a number of casualties, yet the main Chinese attack did not come until early the next morning. Meanwhile, large numbers of refugees continued to move south, causing the British and Australians further concern given the possibility that they might be used by the Chinese to cover the infiltration of their positions. At 08:00 on 5 November a group of around 200 Chinese attacked C Battery, US 61st Field Artillery Battalion, which was attached to the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade. The American guns had been supporting the brigade from a position <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> about [...] south of Pakchon, and were protecting the vital concrete bridge [...] south of the Argyll's battalion headquarters at Kujin.|$|E
500|$|On December 21, 1965, the [...] Trinity Site was {{declared}} a National Historic Landmark district, and on October 15, 1966, was {{listed on the}} National Register of Historic Places.

One of the old instrumentation bunkers is visible <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> just west of ground zero. An inner oblong fence was added in 1967, and the corridor barbed wire fence that connects the outer fence to the inner one was completed in 1972.

500|$|One {{kilometre}} {{from the}} summit, Simpson fell off his bike. Taylor and Hall {{arrived in the}} team car to help him. Hall tried to persuade Simpson to stop when he fell, saying, [...] "Come on Tom, that's it, that's your Tour finished." [...] But Simpson {{said he wanted to}} go on. Taylor was informed and said, [...] "If Tom, wants to go on, he goes." [...] Noticing that his toe straps were still undone, Simpson said, [...] "Me straps, Harry, me straps!" [...] They got him on his bike and pushed him off. Simpson's last words, as remembered by Hall, were 'On, on, on.' The words 'Put me back on my bike!' were invented by Sid Saltmarsh, covering the event for The Sun and Cycling– now Cycling Weekly. Saltmarsh was not there at the time and was in a reception black-spot for live accounts on Radio Tour. Simpson managed to ride a further [...] before he began to wobble. He was held upright by three spectators who then helped him to the ground on side of the road. He was unconscious with his hands locked to the handlebars. Hall shouted for the other mechanic, Ken Ryall, to pry them loose and the pair laid the lifeless Simpson <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> Hall and a nurse from the Tour's medical team took turns giving Simpson mouth-to-mouth resuscitation before Dumas came with an oxygen mask.|$|E
500|$|The hajduk force {{consisted}} of [...] fighters, including also Montenegrins, Mainjani and Primorci, commanded by over-intendant Bošković, harambaša Pivljanin, and the guvernadur of Grbalj. The large Ottoman force crossed the Morača and headed towards Cetinje. The hajduks carried a war flag with Venetian symbols. The hajduks were {{defeated by the}} Ottomans, and Pivljanin was killed in battle. Süleyman had Pivljanin's head sent to the Ottoman Sultan, Mehmed IV, as a great war trophy. The importance of the battle {{is evident in the}} fact that the heads of Pivljanin and his hajduks decorated the entrance hall of the seraglio in Constantinople, and that Süleyman was elevated to pasha following the victory. The severed heads were taken to Constantinople as proof of finishing the task and that the enemy was triumphally defeated. Only heads of worthy, more prominent outlaws, of names and work that was well-known, had this treatment. Heads of hajduks were otherwise put on town palisades or on poles <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> or crossroads. The fact that multiple other hajduk heads were sent to Constantinople along with Pivljanin's could primarily be explained as that the Ottomans wanted to visibly display the defeat of a notable movement, which had brought much grief to them. The news of the battle was recorded in Rome on 27May 1685, in this way: [...] "two courageous leaders, one named Bajo, friend of captain Janko, and the other, captain Vuković the Arbanas, died"; the source states that the defeat was due to a betrayal by Montenegrins in the battle.|$|E
500|$|The {{next move}} for the 4th Division {{was to begin}} {{movement}} down the three causeways through the flooded farmland behind the beach to link up with the 101st Airborne, who had dropped behind enemy lines before dawn. 2nd Battalion and several tanks headed down Causeway 1 towards Poupeville, which they discovered had already been captured by the 3/501st Parachute Infantry Regiment. A dozen German infantrymen, trapped between the two Allied forces, surrendered. Causeway 2, directly behind La Grande Dune, eventually became the main exit road off the beach. Securing this causeway required the capture of Ste. Marie du Mont, about [...] inland. The Germans had blown a small bridge over a culvert, and movement was delayed while engineers made a repair and cleared two inoperable tanks from the road. Causeway 2 quickly became congested, so some units opted {{to walk through the}} flooded areas <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> Several hundred defenders were positioned in and around Ste. Marie du Mont, including 6th Fallschirmjäger Regiment of the 91st Infantry Division. Members of the 506th Parachute Infantry successfully attacked batteries at Holdy and Brécourt Manor and took Ste. Marie du Mont in house-to-house and street combat, clearing the way for 8th Infantry, 3rd Battalion to advance up Causeway 2 practically unopposed. 8th Infantry, 1st Battalion headed up Causeway 3 towards Audouville-la-Hubert, which had already been captured by the 502nd Parachute Infantry. As at Poupeville, enemy soldiers (in this case several dozen) were caught between the two converging forces and had to surrender.|$|E
