5|$|In 2002 LeMond {{joined with}} his parents-in-law David and Sacia Morris, friend Michael Snow and J.P. Morgan & Co. fund manager Jorge Jasson {{to invest in}} the {{exclusive}} Yellowstone Club, a <b>Big</b> <b>Sky,</b> Montana private ski and golf community founded by timber baron Tim Blixseth and his wife Edra. Each of the five partners paid Blixseth $750,000 for one percent shares in the exclusive resort. LeMond also purchased several building lots and maintained a property at the resort. Four years later LeMond and partners sued Blixseth in 2006 following reports of a Credit Suisse loan to the resort of $375million from which Blixseth reportedly took $209million in a disputed partial payout for his ownership stake. The Credit Suisse loan was based on a $1.16billion Cushman & Wakefield valuation of the resort, for which LeMond and partners each sought $11.6million for their one-percent shares. In 2007, LeMond settled his suit with the Blixseths for $39million; however, he and his partners remained creditors as the Blixseths defaulted on a $20million payment (after having already paid the group $18 million), followed by their divorce and the bankruptcy of the Club in 2009.|$|E

40|$|The Fens are a {{naturally}} marshy region in eastern England. Most {{of the area}} was drained several centuries ago, resulting in a flat, damp, low-lying agricultural region. The Fens are a fertile arable region for grains and vegetables, containing around half of the grade 1 agricultural land in England. Despite years of promotion, the Fens are still to develop a positive destination brand and {{the economic impact of}} tourism is low compared to, say, the nearby city of Lincoln. Of 34 visitor attractions in the Fens, only four have attendances over 60, 000 per year. This study examines the attributes of the Fens that form its essence in tourists’ ‘eyes’, which will facilitate the positioning of the proposed area as a destination. Given that people often already have elaborate images about places, destination managers have to link even more sensitively to consumers’ prior images than do brand managers of consumer brands. The authors use a method that combines the advantages of segmentability and comparability offered by attribute-based approaches with the Gestalt-like qualities of qualitative approaches: cognitive causal mapping. The method aims to find those attributes that people believe to be inherently core to the destination brand. It elicits the causal relations people perceive to exist between a destination’s attributes. The causal map shows how and to what extent visitors perceive other attributes to flow from these core attributes. The method demonstrates how people view those attributes that make the area more authentic than attributes that have a less central position in their cognitive causal map. By consequence, these central attributes are identified as more unique for “The Fens”. A pre-study was conducted in which twenty respondents (a convenience sample drawn from visitors selected by intercept sampling at two major visitor destinations: Springfield shopping centre in heart of the Fens; and in Lincoln city centre just beyond the northern edge of the Fens) were asked which attributes come to mind when thinking of “The Fens” as a destination. These served as input for the questionnaire. For the main study, a self-completion questionnaire was distributed to visitors to the two areas by again employing intercept sampling, n = 400 total (200 at each). The main attributes identified by participants as most characteristic of the Fens are: agriculture, countryside, <b>big</b> <b>skies</b> and flatland. The participants like most the features countryside, <b>big</b> <b>skies,</b> flatland, relaxed and friendly whereas they do not like a boring atmosphere. The causal relations which achieved a statistically-significant net proportion of agreement were plotted on a cognitive causal map using Hierarchical Linear Modeling, estimating average regression coefficients for the population. The most significant include: •	The Fens are not boring because they are friendly and have shopping and cathedrals •	The Fens have <b>big</b> <b>skies</b> because they have countryside and flatland •	The Fens are relaxed because they have countryside and <b>big</b> <b>skies.</b> The cognitive causal maps can facilitate the design of campaigns to attract more visitors in the area. For example, the feature ‘boring’, which is not liked by visitors, can be mitigated by marketing communications indicating that the Fens are not boring because they are friendly and have shopping and cathedrals. Marketing communications can be designed to emphasise the most characteristic features of the Fens that are most liked, for example demonstrating that the Fens have <b>big</b> <b>skies</b> because they have countryside and flatland; and are relaxed because they have countryside and <b>big</b> <b>skies...</b>|$|R
