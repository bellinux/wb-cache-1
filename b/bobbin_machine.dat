50|$|John Heathcoat (1783-1861), {{inventor}} and industrialist, {{operated a}} textile mill in Hathern (where, in 1808-9, he invented the <b>bobbin</b> net <b>machine,</b> for weaving a lace-like hexagonal net), before moving his business first to Loughborough, {{and later to}} Tiverton, Devon.|$|R
40|$|Winding is a {{key process}} in the {{manufacturing}} process of textile industry. The normal and effective operation of winding process plays {{a very important role}} on the textiles’ quality and economic effects. At present, a large proportion of bobbins which collected from winder still have yarn left over. The bobbin recycling is severely limited and quick running of winder is seriously restricted, the invention of the the automatic <b>bobbin</b> sorting <b>machine</b> has solved this problem. The ability to distinguish bobbin which has yarn left over from the rest and the classification accuracy of color are the two important performance indicators for <b>bobbin</b> sorting <b>machine.</b> According to the development and application of the color recognition technology and the artificial intelligence method, this study proposes a novel color recognition method that based on BP neural networks. The result shows that the accuracy of color recognition reaches 98 %.  </p...|$|R
5000|$|Bobbinet tulle or genuine tulle is a {{specific}} type of tulle which has been made in the United Kingdom since the invention of the bobbinet machine [...] Heathcoat coined the term [...] "bobbin net", or bobbinet as it is spelled today, to distinguish this machine-made tulle from the handmade [...] "pillow lace". Pillow lace, called so because of the pillow used to produce handmade <b>bobbin</b> lace. <b>Machines</b> based on his original designs are still in operation today producing fabrics in Perry Street, Chard, Somerset, UK.|$|R
5000|$|Standards of {{industrial}} production were not introduced until the 1990s, when the Chenille International Manufacturers Association (CIMA) was formed {{with the mission}} to improve and develop the manufacturing processes. [...] From the 1970s each machine head made two chenille yarns straight onto <b>bobbins,</b> a <b>machine</b> could have over 100 spindles (50 heads). Giesse {{was one of the}} first major machine manufacturers. Giesse acquired Iteco company in 2010 integrating the chenille yarn electronic quality control directly on their machine. Chenille fabrics are also often used in Letterman jackets also known as [...] "varsity jackets", for the letter patches.|$|R
500|$|The reel, {{originally}} {{developed for the}} silk industry, now has multiple uses. The earliest surviving depiction of a European spinning wheel is a panel of stained glass in the Cathedral of Chartres. [...] <b>Bobbins</b> and warping <b>machines</b> appear together in the stained glass at Chartres and in a fresco in the Cologne Kunkelhaus (ca 1300). It {{is possible that the}} toothed warping machine was created by the silk industry; it allowed the warp to be more uniform and allowed the warp to be of a longer length.|$|R
25|$|Twisting is {{the process}} in which two or more single-spun yarns are united to produce a yarn of greater {{strength}} for use as warp threads in the weaving process and for normal knitting purposes. This is done by rollers delivering the yarns to a revolving spindle which twists or folds the single yarns around one another. The machines used are similar to spinning frames in their method of applying twist, but differ in that they have only one set of delivery rollers {{instead of the usual}} complement of drafting rollers. This machine is an early example of a flyer twisting frame. On the flyer twister, twist imparted to the yarn in a similar manner as on the flyer spinner. A weighted band, running in a groove {{at the base of the}} bobbin, retards the revolving bobbin creating enough tension for the flyer to wind the yarn evenly onto the <b>bobbin.</b> The <b>machine</b> is hand doffed.|$|R
40|$|We {{proposed}} {{a new type}} of tactile sensor that is capable of determining the surface morphology of skin lesions. The sensor consists of a brass cylinder with an axial bore. Three peripheral <b>bobbins</b> were <b>machined</b> in the cylinder around which three coils have been wound. An iron core can easily move inside the bore. One of the coils acts as primary and the other two are secondary coils. Change in the position of the core due to surface peaks and valleys causes the induced voltage in the secondary coils to vary. This change in the voltage is a measure of core position and reveals the morphological features of the surface (surface profile). Experiments show that the proposed sensor is capable of discriminating between the models of two different types of skin lesions, namely, anetoderma and nodule, which resemble each other in visual inspection but behave differently when being touched. Thus, this sensor could be used as an assist device for diagnosis purposes in teledermatology systems...|$|R
50|$|The {{trade of}} making lace by hand was a {{well-established}} cottage {{industry in the}} East Midlands by the late 16th century, and the earliest record of it in Helmdon dates from 1718. Makers around Towcester and Buckingham {{had a reputation for}} the finest lace, and although mechanised competition began with Heathcoat's <b>bobbin</b> net <b>machine</b> in 1808, quality lace-making by hand thrived for several more decades. Helmdon had lace-making schools that taught girls the trade from an early age. Lace-making in the parish peaked {{in the middle of the}} 19th century, when the 1851 Census recorded that 94 women and girls — more than 30% of all Helmdon's female inhabitants — worked in the trade, and the youngest workers were under 10 years old. Thereafter mechanical lace-making did reduce the market for hand-made lace. The 1891 Census recorded only six women in Helmdon employed in the trade, and only one of those was aged under 40.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this study, we have {{proposed}} {{a new type of}} tactile sensor that is capable of detecting the stiffness of soft objects. The sensor consists of a brass cylinder with an axial bore. An iron core can easily move inside the bore. Three peripheral <b>bobbins</b> were <b>machined</b> in the cylinder around which three coils have been wound. One of the coils was excited with an alternating current which caused a voltage to be induced in two other coils. A return spring was used to return the core to its initial position after it has been moved. The sensor was pressed against the surface of the object whose stiffness was going to be measured. The position of the core in this state was depended on the stiffness of the given object and the spring constant and was measured by measuring the change in the induced voltage in secondary coils. The proposed sensor was capable of measuring two contact parameters namely the applied force and the stiffness of the object. Using the data of this sensor, three different objects, made of polyurethane, silicon rubber and paraffin gel were discriminated. Thus, this sensor could be used in robot hands and minimally invasive surgery tools to improve their operation...|$|R
25|$|The next {{process is}} to draw the slivers out further, and to give the fibres a small twist to {{strengthen}} the resulting slubbing such {{that it can be}} wound onto a bobbin. At Coldharbour Mill, this is demonstrated on a Price Smith and Stells draw box of 1959. The <b>bobbins</b> from this <b>machine</b> are then placed in a further draw box by Prince Smith and Stells, this time an 1898 machine, and the thread from a pair of bobbins is drawn out to a seventh of its diameter, and given a light twist. If this output is to be used for Aran yarn production, it is termed a roving, and is sent on to the spinning frame. However, if the slubbing is for double knitting yarn, the slubbing must go through another reduction on a draw box.|$|R
5000|$|Overlock {{stitching}} {{was invented}} by the Merrow Machine Company in 1881.J. Makens Merrow and his son Joseph Merrow, who owned a knitting mill established in Connecticut in 1838, developed a number of technological advancements {{to be used in}} the mill’s operations. Merrow's first patent was a machine for crochet stitching, and the Merrow Machine Company still produces crochet machines based on this original model. This technology was a starting point for the development of the overlock machine, patented by Joseph Merrow in 1889. Unlike standard lockstitching, which uses a <b>bobbin,</b> overlock sewing <b>machines</b> utilize loopers to create thread loops for the needle to pass through, in a manner similar to crocheting. Merrow's original three-thread overedge sewing machine is the forerunner of contemporary overlocking machines. Over time, the Merrow Machine Company pioneered the design of new machines to create a variety of overlock stitches, such as two- and four-thread machines, the one-thread butted seam, and the cutterless emblem edger.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} of its closure in April 1981, Coldharbour Mill still had its textile {{machinery}} in position. The majority of these machines have been preserved (though not all are exhibited), and have been augmented with weaving machines rescued from the closure of the Tonedale site. The lowest part of the site, the level 1 combing shed, dealt with the initial cleaning and combing of the unwashed wool. The process involved a number of separate stages, each with a specialised machine. The eight opening gill machines (made by Taylor Wadsworth & Co)opened up the fleeces and prepared the wool for washing in a large back-washer with steam heated rollers. Following the washing, further gill boxes produced successively combed fibres, which were passed to a circular Noble combing machine. This machine separated the fibres into long [...] "Tops" [...] and the short poor quality fibres. Although these machines are preserved on site, they are no longer in use today. British wool tops are purchased in, dyed into standard colours, and then up to ten strands of tops are fed into the Intersecting Gill Box (manufactured by Prince Smith and Stells in 1959). The gill box starts the process of drawing out the fibres, and also enables new colours to be created by blending together the standard colours. The output of the gill box is termed a sliver. This particular machine has a mechanism to ensure the weight of the sliver is constant, which is important to ensure the final yarn thickness is constant. The next process is to draw the slivers out further, and to give the fibres a small twist to strengthen the resulting slubbing such that it can be wound onto a bobbin. At Coldharbour Mill, this is demonstrated on a Price Smith and Stells draw box of 1959. The <b>bobbins</b> from this <b>machine</b> are then placed in a further draw box by Prince Smith and Stells, this time an 1898 machine, and the thread from a pair of bobbins is drawn out to a seventh of its diameter, and given a light twist.

However, if the slubbing is for double knitting yarn, the slubbing must go through another reduction on a draw box.|$|R
40|$|At last {{have made}} a {{wonderful}} discovery in valley, a magnificent tomb with seals intact”: Howard Carter described the opening of Tut’s tomb. Carter’s experience is so familiar to me, I need only to change a few words: “Darkness and blank space—but presently, as my eyes grew accustomed to the light, details of the room within emerged slowly... strange <b>machines,</b> <b>bobbins,</b> and silk—everywhere the gloss of silk... Packed tightly were scores of objects, any one of which would have filled us with excitement. ” One hundred forty miles northwest of Washington, D. C., where Dans Mountain stands about 3, 000 feet above Western Maryland’s bituminous coal fields, the Georges Creek Coal and Iron Company established the town of Lonaconing in 1835. Seventy-five years later the population of mostly coal miners and their families exceeded 2, 000. The Klots Throwing Company erected a silk mill in Lonaconing in 1905, which closed its doors in 1957, and has stood for nearly a hundred years to become both monument and tomb for the Queen of fibers. This field report describes early twentieth-century silk yarn production in situ. Silk industry barons of the Gilded Age chose remote mountain locations for their mills, and the Allegheny Mountains sheltered the Lonaconing mill {{for nearly half a}} century. Dark windows in its red brick building obscure the treasure within: 48, 000 square feet of mill floor supporting over 360 machines built for twisting, winding, and spinning silk filaments, with yarn still wound on their bobbins and swifts; substantial steam and drying chambers and heavy iron centrifugal extractors, tons of parts, and millions of accessories. Provenance is etched on steel and cast in iron: “The Columbian” single- and double-deck Atwood winders; Toledo Scales; Westinghouse motors, and Crouse Hinds conduit; centrifugal pump and humidifying system by Buffalo Forge, and extractor from Tolhurst Foundry in Troy, New York. Paperwork is stacked in drawers, tacked to beams, and wedged between things: with soaking formulae, production notes, or just repair schedules. A calendar-sized board nailed to a beam has tiny lot-numbered skeins hung all over the surface; the gloss of rayon or the pearl of silk shine through fifty years of soot. The machine shop lathe reads 2 ̆ 21861. 2 ̆ 2 Accessories read 2 ̆ 21880. 2 ̆ 2 Work benches, tables, and chests of drawers are stocked with sundry medicines like eyewash, mercurochrome, and spirits of ammonia. Even the workers’ toilets suggest something of their world: eight stalls shared two rolls of paper, mounted on the outside. Faded, gaudy, umbrellas are tucked everywhere and women 2 ̆ 7 s shoes—perhaps thirty pair—are hung on spindles and tossed into tag bins. They are all early fifties style, with pointed toes, chunky heels, and well-creased insteps, thrown aside by workers after eight or more hours of moving up and down the mill aisles.
