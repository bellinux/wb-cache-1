40|$|Making {{accurate}} voltage {{and current}} noise measurements on op amps in the nano volt and femto amp range can be challenging. This problem is often addressed by two different approaches. Both approaches concentrate on reducing {{the noise of the}} amplifiers used to measure the Device Under Test (DUT). The 1 st approach uses conventional cross-correlation techniques to remove un-correlated noise and a procedure to remove the correlated noise contributions made by the amplifiers used to measure the DUT [1]. The 2 nd approach, and the subject of this Application Note, consists of designing a test platform with an effective background noise at least 10 dB lower than the DUT. To obtain a test platform with this level of performance requires: the removal of environmental electrical disturbances, the use of batteries for low noise voltage sources, the use of a Post Amplifier (PA) to raise the DUT noise above the measurement system’s noise floor, control software to measure accurate noise data down to 0. 1 Hz and processing software to eliminate external noise and generate the DUT’s voltage (e n) and current (i n) noise plots.

40|$|The {{visual system}} {{continually}} adjusts its sensitivity, or ‘adapts’, {{to the conditions}} of the immediate environment. Adaptation increases responses when input signals are weak, to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, and decreases responses when input signals are strong, to prevent response saturation. Retinal ganglion cells adapt primarily to two properties of light input: the mean intensity and the variance of intensity over time (contrast). This review focuses on cellular mechanisms for contrast adaptation in mammalian retina. High contrast over the ganglion cell's receptive field centre reduces the gain of spiking responses. The mechanism for gain control arises partly in presynaptic <b>bipolar</b> cell <b>inputs</b> and partly in the process of spike generation. Following strong contrast stimulation, ganglion cells exhibit a prolonged after-hyperpolarization, driven primarily by suppression of glutamate release from presynaptic bipolar cells. Ganglion cells also adapt to high contrast over their peripheral receptive field. Long-range adaptive signals are carried by amacrine cells that inhibit the ganglion cell directly, causing hyperpolarization, and inhibit presynaptic bipolar terminals, reducing gain of their synaptic output. Thus, contrast adaptation in ganglion cells involves multiple synaptic and intrinsic mechanisms for gain control and hyperpolarization. Several forms of adaptation in ganglion cells originate in presynaptic bipolar cells...|$|R
40|$|In most {{applications}} of high speed op amps, {{it is the}} total output rms noise that is generally of interest. Because of the high bandwidths involved, the chief contributor to the output rms noise is therefore the white noise, and the 1 /f noise is negligible. Typical high speed op amps have bandwidths greater than 150 MHz or so, and bipolar voltage feedback (VFB) input stages have input voltage noises ranging from about 1 to 20 nV/√Hz. For a VFB op amp, the inverting and non-inverting input current noise are typically equal, and almost always uncorrelated. Typical values for wideband VFB op amps range from 0. 5 to 5 pA/√Hz. The input current noise of a <b>bipolar</b> <b>input</b> stage is increased when input bias-current compensation generators are added, because their current noise is not correlated, and therefore adds (in a root-sum-square manner) to the intrinsic current noise of the bipolar stage. However, bias current compensation is rarely used in high speed op amps. The input voltage noise in current feedback (CFB) op amps tends to be lower than for VFB op amps having the same approximate bandwidth. This is because the input stage in a CFB op amp is usually operated at a higher current, thereby reducing the emitter resistance and hence the voltage noise. Typical values for CFB op amps range from about 1 to 5 nV/√Hz...|$|E

We identified the site of ON-cone <b>bipolar</b> <b>input</b> onto DA cells in transgenic mice in which both types of catecholaminergic amacrine (CA) cells were labeled with green fluorescent protein or human placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP). In confocal Z series of retinal whole mounts stained with antibodies to tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), DA cells gave rise to varicose processes that descended obliquely through the scleral half of the inner plexiform layer (IPL) and formed a loose, tangential plexus {{in the middle of this}} layer. Comparison with the distribution of the dendrites of type 2 CA cells and examination of neurobiotininjected DA cells proved that their vitreal processes were situated in stratum S 3 of the IPL. Electron microscope demonstration of PLAP activity showed that bipolar cell endings in S 3 established ribbon synapses onto a postsynaptic dyad in which one or both processes were labeled by a precipitate of lead phosphate and therefore belonged to DA cells. In places, the postsynaptic DA cell processes returned a reciprocal synapse onto the bipolar endings. Confocal images of sections stained with antibodies to TH, kinesin Kif 3 a, which labels synaptic ribbons, and glutamate or GABAA receptors, confirmed that ribbon-containing endings made glutamatergic synapses onto DA cells processes in S 3 and received from them GABAergic synapses.

40|$|Glaucoma is {{associated}} with excitotoxicity in which increased glutamate release leads to apoptotic death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Acetylcholine (ACh) has shown neuroprotection of RGCs through the stimulation of RGCs’ nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). The cholinergic amacrine cells are the only cells in retina which synthesize and release ACh. They get excitatory inputs from bipolar cells. The presence of α 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α 7 nAChRs) on the cholinergic amacrines, bipolar cells and RGCs is documented. Recently, stimulation of presynaptic nAChRs of cholinergic cells was shown to enhance ACh release in the rat superior cervical ganglion. Therefore, we hypothesized that α 7 nAChRs stimulation by tropisetron and PNU 282987 (α 7 nAChR agonists) could induce ACh release through either direct stimulation of cholinergic amacrine α 7 nAChRs or indirect stimulation of bipolar α 7 nAChRs. For ACh release studies, pig eyes were dissected and cholinergic amacrine cells were labeled with 40 μCi of 3 H-choline in which the retina was flashed with light (3 Hz) for 30 minutes to maximize 3 H-choline uptake. Then, the eyecup was transferred to a perfusion chamber, washed for 20 minutes. 1 minute output fractions were collected into vials and prepared for liquid scintillation counting. To assess {{the viability of the}} preparation, light and kainate were applied. Light (2 - 3 fold increase), kainate (3 - 4 fold; 10 - 100 μM), α 7 nAChR agonists (2 - 4 fold; 0. 01 - 100 nM) evoked ACh release greater than the baseline in the absence of DNQX (a glutamate receptor antagonist). In the presence of DNQX, which blocked <b>bipolar</b> <b>input</b> to cholinergic cells, α 7 nAChRs stimulation did not increase ACh release from baseline. Hence, the possibility of indirect input of bipolar α 7 nAChRs for ACh release was supported. Our results indicate that ACh release through α 7 nAChRs stimulation is possible and specifically the bipolar α 7 nAChRs release of ACh via an indirect positive feedback mechanism. During excitotoxicity, ACh released by amacrine cells, might feedback on bipolar nAChRs to increase ACh release. The neuroprotective effect of tropisetron on α 7 nAChRs on isolated RGCs is documented. Our study suggests that tropisetron might also protect RGCs through increased ACh release by possible indirect modulation. This study indicates the possibility of dual therapeutic targets of α 7 nAChRs in the retina for neuroprotection against RGC excitotoxicity...|$|E
40|$|The {{schematics}} of two novel reference-regulator circuits {{have been}} presented. These use lateral PNP transistors {{that are available}} in standard CMOS technologies. The accuracy performance of these references over conventional designs is enhanced due {{to the use of}} <b>bipolar</b> devices as <b>input</b> stages of the amplifier. The low Early voltage and β-variation, characteristic of these devices, has been accounted for in the designs. GEDC Industry Advisory Board, April 2004. © 2004 Georgia Electronic Design Center.

40|$|AbstractThis review {{summarizes}} {{recent work}} relevant to receptive field structure of {{cells of the}} parvocellular (PC) and (MC) magnocellular pathways in the primate. In the PC-pathway, recent data suggest that different color- and cone-opponent ganglion cells make up specific anatomical classes with specific cone connectivities and <b>bipolar</b> cell <b>input.</b> For example, blue-on ganglion cells have been identified anatomically as the small bistratified ganglion cell class. For the midget ganglion cells, which appear to be red-green opponent, {{there seems to be}} only one mosaic for red and green on-center and one for red and green off-center cells. This mixture of cell type within a retinal cell mosaic is unusual, as is the fact that dendritic trees of neighboring midget cells do not overlap. Physiologically, all PC-cells lack a contrast gain control mechanism and show a high degree of spatial and temporal linearity of their responses. In the magnocellular pathway, on- and off-center cells, corresponding to parasol cells with dendritic trees ramifying in the inner and outer sublaminae of the inner plexiform layer, show properties familiar from studies of cat ganglion cells, e. g. a contrast gain control is present. However, a chromatic input to the receptive field surround gives their responses an additional order of complexity...|$|R
40|$|The {{correlation}} between cholinergic sensitivity {{and the level}} of stratification for ganglion cells was examined in the rabbit retina. As examples, we have used ON or OFF alpha ganglion cells and ON/OFF directionally selective (DS) ganglion cells. Nicotine, a cholinergic agonist, depolarized ON/OFF DS ganglion cells and greatly enhanced their firing rates but it had modest excitatory effects on ON or OFF alpha ganglion cells. As previously reported, we conclude that DS ganglion cells are the most sensitive to cholinergic drugs. Confocal imaging showed that ON/OFF DS ganglion cells ramify precisely {{at the level of the}} cholinergic amacrine cell dendrites, and co-fasciculate with the cholinergic matrix of starburst amacrine cells. However, neither ON or OFF alpha ganglion cells have more than a chance association with the cholinergic matrix. Z -axis reconstruction showed that OFF alpha ganglion cells stratify just below the cholinergic band in sublamina a while ON alpha ganglion cells stratify just below cholinergic b. The latter is at the same level as the terminals of calbindin bipolar cells. Thus, the calbindin bipolar cell appears to be a prime candidate to provide the <b>bipolar</b> cell <b>input</b> to ON alpha ganglion cells in the rabbit retina. We conclude that the precise level of stratification is correlated with the strength of cholinergic input. Alpha ganglion cells receive a weak cholinergic input and they are narrowly stratified just below the cholinergic bands...|$|R
