50|$|In most cases, {{integrated}} e-commerce {{is in one}} way {{or another}} acknowledged by the supplier of the <b>back-end</b> <b>system,</b> such as SAP ERP or Microsoft Dynamics.Although many B2B e-commerce suppliers claim to be integrated, most web stores are interfaced. With integrated e-commerce, the software solution is installed on top of the <b>back-end</b> <b>system.</b> This means that the connection between the business logic and database of a <b>back-end</b> <b>system</b> is set up manually. Information that is available in the <b>back-end</b> <b>system</b> is being duplicated into the e-commerce software. An interfaced e-commerce software product thus has their own database and business logic that are being synchronized constantly through a connection to a certain <b>back-end</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
50|$|Integrated {{e-commerce}} is upcoming. With integrated e-commerce, part of {{the software}} solution is installed inside the ERP <b>back-end</b> <b>system.</b> This means that {{the connection between the}} business logic and database of a <b>back-end</b> <b>system</b> is configured automatically. Information that is available in the <b>back-end</b> <b>system,</b> for example article numbers, prices and current stock availability of products, is leveraged, without being copied to another system, and displayed in the front/back end of the e-commerce system. An integrated e-commerce software solution thus does not require investments in recreating and maintaining a separate database or business logic. Instead, it re-uses those of the <b>back-end</b> <b>system,</b> so all data are stored in one, single place. This can prevent input redundancy, errors and synchronization time.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a new {{information}} architecture for real-time data exchange between intelligent products and <b>back-end</b> <b>systems</b> is presented. As intelligent {{products that are}} capable of recording data about their surroundings become part of daily life, privacy protection must be addressed.

Guidelines are presented for designing information systems involving intelligent products so that the consumer’s right to privacy is taken into account. The applicability of state-of-the art security technologies for protecting the confidentiality of transactions in the information architecture is demonstrated through concrete demonstrator scenarios involving intelligent products and <b>back-end</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

This paper explores smart and thin client architectures that have been successfully used by enterprises to build mobile solutions with new technologies in database management systems and different programming languages. The paper will also explore the differences between smart client and thin client mobile architectures, and when people would want to use each. It will then examine the details of common smart client architectures, including what type of <b>back-end</b> <b>systems</b> they integrate with, the types of devices they support, how data is managed within the architecture, and development languages {{that can be used}} to build the application...|$|R

40|$|Contemporary Web sites {{typically}} {{consist of}} front-end Web servers, application servers, and <b>back-end</b> information <b>systems</b> such as database servers. There {{has been limited}} research on how to provide overload control and service differentiation for the <b>back-end</b> <b>systems.</b> In this paper we propose an architecture called tiered service (TS) for these purposes. In TS, there are several heterogeneous <b>back-end</b> <b>systems</b> to serve the Web applications. The Web applications communicate with a routing intermediary to intelligently route the queries to the appropriate back-end servers based on various policies such as client profiles and server load. In our system the back ends may store different qualities of data; lower quality data typically requires less overhead to serve. The main contributions of this paper include (i) a tiered content replication scheme that replicates tiered qualities of data on heterogeneous back ends with different capacity to satisfy clients with diverse requirements for latency and quality of data (ii) an application-transparent query routing architecture that automatically routes the queries to the appropriate back ends. The architecture was implemented in our test bed, and its performance was benchmarked. The experimental results demonstrate that TS offers significant performance improvement...|$|R

50|$|In general, Beacon {{was viewed}} as a mistake because it {{appeared}} to be too explicit about the intentions inscribed in its protocol. By learning from its unsuccessful experience, Facebook has been seeking other ways to monetize their user database through social advertising.

In this way, a lot of resistance from the user population could be largely removed. To be more specific, some argue that Facebook Beacon had paved way for its subsequent service, Facebook connect, both adopting the idea of utilizing third-party data.|$|E
