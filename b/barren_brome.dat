5000|$|Bromus sterilis is {{an annual}} or {{biennial}} species of bromegrass known as <b>barren</b> <b>brome,</b> poverty brome, and sterile brome.|$|E
50|$|The {{plant is}} pollinated by the grizzled skipper (Pyrgus wyandot), {{a species of}} {{butterfly}} which is declining in numbers. Its decline in some areas {{has been attributed to}} the use of the pesticide Dimilin to control gypsy moth (Limantria dispar). Other threats to the species are loss of shale barren habitat to the construction of railroads, hiking trails, and a dam. Many populations are heavily browsed by deer. It is not a successful competitor against introduced species such as <b>barren</b> <b>brome</b> (Bromus sterilis) and tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima).|$|E
40|$|Bromus sterilis L. (<b>barren</b> <b>brome)</b> spreads {{rapidly in}} many European regions. In the Czech Republic, its {{importance}} {{has increased dramatically}} over the past 10 years. <b>Barren</b> <b>brome</b> is reported as a problem weed in winter crops such as winter wheat, winter barley and oil seed rape, in vineyards and in other cultivated places. <b>Barren</b> <b>brome</b> has been becoming troublesome weed of winter cereals mainly in reduced soil tillage systems. The factors, that are important for its spreading and adaptability under different environmental conditions, are dormancy and germination. Optimal timing for seed germination varies with respect to natural conditions and it is determining for plant development. These traits are adapted to different conditions and habitats; therefore the dormancy and germination response patterns to those conditions vary significantly. Recently {{there are not many}} information available on germination behaviour, therefore this study was focused on seeds of <b>barren</b> <b>brome</b> and its characteristics, which were collected in different regions of the Czech Republic. Seeds were investigated under different temperatures, light regimes and water stress {{in a wide range of}} conditions. The following characteristics of seeds were studied the dormancy, the dynamics of germination, the temperature optimum, the age of seeds and dynamics of emergence from different depths and persistence in the soil profile under field conditions. Dormancy and germination are influenced by external conditions. The dormancy of seeds <b>barren</b> <b>brome</b> is very short or missing. The germination is influenced by light; the seeds germinated better under darkness than under light regime. The primary dormancy of B. sterilis was short and the seeds needed only three weeks for after-ripening. The seeds of B. sterilis showed broad ecological valence to hydrothermal factors germinating in the wide range of 3 to 35 °C. The temperature optimum is 5 - 23 °C. The germination was only slightly influenced in an environment with low water potential. Germination was limited under water stress only at lower temperatures under 10 °C. The response to light at various temperatures showed that seeds germinated better in darkness in all temperatures regimes, than in alternating light regime, especially at lower temperatures. The emergence declined significantly with burial depth (under 40 mm). The seeds were not able to survive in the soil seed bank for a longer time and fall seeds lost viability after 1 year burial in soil profile. These results may be of value for development of predictive models and understanding period when weed control may be most feasible...|$|E
5000|$|Vulpia bromoides, squirreltail fescue, <b>barren</b> fescue or <b>brome</b> fescue, is a winterannual grass species {{native to}} Europe, North Africa, and Asia Minor. It has been {{introduced}} to North America, the Hawaiian Islands, Puerto Rico and other places.|$|R
40|$|Bromus sterilis L. (<b>barren</b> <b>brome)</b> {{has become}} a {{troublesome}} weed of winter cereals in reduced tillage systems, mainly in South and North America, middle and Western Europe. In the Czech Republic, its importance has increased dramatically over the past 10 years. <b>Barren</b> <b>brome</b> is reported as a problem weed in other winter crops such as oil seed rape, in vineyards and in other cultivated places. In this study, the dormancy and germination under different temperatures, water and light regimes were investigated. Emergence from different depths and persistence in the soil profile were investigated under field conditions. The seeds of Bromus sterilis showed broad ecological valence to hydrothermal factors germinating in {{the wide range of}} 5 to 35 °C. Similarly, no strong effect on the germination in an environment with low water potential was observed. The response to light at various temperatures showed that seeds germinated better in darkness. The emergence declined significantly with burial depth (under 40 mm). The loss of primary dormancy was rapid in time and only 50 % of the seeds germinated within 8 weeks after collecting from maternal plants. The seeds were not able to survive in the soil seed bank for a longer time and fall seeds lost viability 1 year after burial in a soil profile...|$|E
40|$|This {{experiment}} set out {{to examine}} which, if any, practical management regimes applied to land taken out of arable cropping are most effective in enhancing biodiversity whilst controlling the pernicious weed <b>barren</b> <b>Brome</b> Anisantha sterilis. Of seven treatments, six comprised a sown, species-rich mixture of native grasses and forbs, and one was left to regenerate naturally. Five of the sown treatments were oversown with A. sterilis to examine the role of this aggressive weed in preventing the establishment of sown species. Under various cutting regimes, the abundance of individual sown species was variable in year 1, but increased and converged by year 3. The exception was the treatment to which fertiliser was added, in which coarse grasses including A. sterilis were abundant, {{and the establishment of}} sown species correspondingly poor. At one of the sites examined, establishment appeared to be enhanced by the spring application of graminicide at a sufficiently low rate to control A. sterilis whilst remaining sub-lethal to finer-leaved sown grasses. The natural regeneration plots, in which naturally-occurring A. sterilis was present in all three years, had many fewer plant species than those sown with native seed mixtures...|$|E
40|$|Verticillium longisporum is a soil-borne fungal {{pathogen}} causing {{vascular wilt}} of Brassica crops. This {{study was conducted}} to enhance our knowledge on the host range of V. longisporum. Seven crop species (barley, oat, oilseed rape, pea, red clover, sugar beet and wheat) and five weed species (<b>barren</b> <b>brome,</b> black-grass, charlock, cleavers and scentless mayweed) all common in southern Sweden were evaluated for infection by response to V. longisporum. Oat, spring wheat, oilseed rape, scentless mayweed and charlock inoculated with V. longisporum in a greenhouse showed stunting to various degrees close to the fully ripe stage. Based on the extent of microsclerotia formation, explants were separated into four groups: for pea and wheat, 80 %. The results suggest that plant species outside the Brassicaceae can act as reservoirs of V. longisporum inoculum. Soil inoculum densities in nine fields were monitored over a period of 12 months, which ranged from 1 to 48 cfu g¿ 1 soil. Density of microsclerotia was lowest just after harvest, reaching its maximum six months later. No significant correlation between inoculum density in soil and disease incidence on oilseed rape plants was found. However, the data suggest that a threshold of 1 cfu g¿ 1 soil is needed to cause disease on oilseed rape. Species identification based on microsclerotia morphology and PCR analysis showed that V. longisporum dominated in soil of seven, and V. dahliae in two of the nine fields studied...|$|E
40|$|The project {{investigated}} {{whether it}} would be possible to remove the main technical hindrance to precision application of herbicides to arable crops in the UK, namely creating geo-referenced weed maps for each field. The ultimate goal is an information system so that agronomists and farmers can plan precision weed control and create spraying maps. The project focussed on black-grass in wheat, but research was also carried out on barley and beans and on wild-oats, <b>barren</b> <b>brome,</b> rye-grass, cleavers and thistles which form stable patches in arable fields. Farmers may also make special efforts to control them. Using cameras mounted on farm machinery, the project explored the feasibility of automating the process of mapping black-grass in fields. Geo-referenced images were captured from June to December 2009, using sprayers, a tractor, combine harvesters and on foot. Cameras were mounted on the sprayer boom, on windows or on top of tractor and combine cabs and images were captured with a range of vibration levels and at speeds up to 20 km h- 1. For acceptability to farmers, it was important that every image containing black-grass was classified as containing black-grass; false negatives are highly undesirable. The software algorithms recorded no false negatives in sample images analysed to date, although some black-grass heads were unclassified and there were also false positives. The density of black-grass heads per unit area estimated by machine vision increased as a linear function of the actual density with a mean detection rate of 47...|$|E
40|$|Many weeds {{occur in}} patches but farmers {{frequently}} spray whole fields {{to control the}} weeds in these patches. Given a geo-referenced weed map, technology exists to confine spraying to these patches. Adoption of patch spraying by arable farmers has, however, been negligible {{partly due to the}} difficulty of constructing weed maps. Building on previous DEFRA and HGCA projects, this proposal aims to develop and evaluate a machine vision system to automate the weed mapping process. The project thereby addresses the principal technical stumbling block to widespread adoption of site specific weed management (SSWM). The accuracy of weed identification by machine vision based on a single field survey may be inadequate to create herbicide application maps. We therefore propose to test the hypothesis that sufficiently accurate weed maps can be constructed by integrating information from geo-referenced images captured automatically at different times of the year during normal field activities. Accuracy of identification will also be increased by utilising a priori knowledge of weeds present in fields. To prove this concept, images will be captured from arable fields on two farms and processed offline to identify and map the weeds, focussing especially on black-grass, wild oats, <b>barren</b> <b>brome,</b> couch grass and cleavers. As advocated by Lutman et al. (2002), the approach uncouples the weed mapping and treatment processes and builds on the observation that patches of these weeds are quite stable in arable fields. There are three main aspects to the project. 1) Machine vision hardware. Hardware component parts of the system are one or more cameras connected to a single board computer (Concurrent Solutions LLC) and interfaced with an accurate Global Positioning System (GPS) supplied by Patchwork Technology. The camera(s) will take separate measurements {{for each of the three}} primary colours of visible light (red, green and blue) in each pixel. The basic proof of concept can be achieved in principle using a single camera system, but in practice systems with more than one camera may need to be installed so that larger fractions of each field can be photographed. Hardware will be reviewed regularly during the project in response to feedback from other work packages and updated as required. 2) Image capture and weed identification software. The machine vision system will be attached to toolbars of farm machinery so that images can be collected during different field operations. Images will be captured at different ground speeds, in different directions and at different crop growth stages as well as in different crop backgrounds. Having captured geo-referenced images in the field, image analysis software will be developed to identify weed species by Murray State and Reading Universities with advice from The Arable Group. A wide range of pattern recognition and in particular Bayesian Networks will be used to advance the state of the art in machine vision-based weed identification and mapping. Weed identification algorithms used by others are inadequate for this project as we intend to collect and correlate images collected at different growth stages. Plants grown for this purpose by Herbiseed will be used in the first instance. In addition, our image capture and analysis system will include plant characteristics such as leaf shape, size, vein structure, colour and textural pattern, some of which are not detectable by other machine vision systems or are omitted by their algorithms. Using such a list of features observable using our machine vision system, we will determine those that can be used to distinguish weed species of interest. 3) Weed mapping. Geo-referenced maps of weeds in arable fields (Reading University and Syngenta) will be produced with advice from The Arable Group and Patchwork Technology. Natural infestations will be mapped in the fields but we will also introduce specimen plants in pots to facilitate more rigorous system evaluation and testing. Manual weed maps of the same fields will be generated by Reading University, Syngenta and Peter Lutman so that the accuracy of automated mapping can be assessed. The principal hypothesis and concept to be tested is that by combining maps from several surveys, a weed map with acceptable accuracy for endusers can be produced. If the concept is proved and can be commercialised, systems could be retrofitted at low cost onto existing farm machinery. The outputs of the weed mapping software would then link with the precision farming options already built into many commercial sprayers, allowing their use for targeted, site-specific herbicide applications. Immediate economic benefits would, therefore, arise directly from reducing herbicide costs. SSWM will also reduce the overall pesticide load on the crop and so may reduce pesticide residues in food and drinking water, and reduce adverse impacts of pesticides on non-target species and beneficials. Farmers may even choose to leave unsprayed some non-injurious, environmentally-beneficial, low density weed infestations. These benefits fit very well with the anticipated legislation emerging in the new EU Thematic Strategy for Pesticides which will encourage more targeted use of pesticides and greater uptake of Integrated Crop (Pest) Management approaches, and also with the requirements of the Water Framework Directive to reduce levels of pesticides in water bodies. The greater precision of weed management offered by SSWM is therefore a key element in preparing arable farming systems for the future, where policy makers and consumers want to minimise pesticide use and the carbon footprint of farming while maintaining food production and security. The mapping technology could also be used on organic farms to identify areas of fields needing mechanical weed control thereby reducing both carbon footprints and also damage to crops by, for example, spring tines. Objective i. To develop a prototype machine vision system for automated image capture during agricultural field operations; ii. To prove the concept that images captured by the machine vision system over a series of field operations can be processed to identify and geo-reference specific weeds in the field; iii. To generate weed maps from the geo-referenced, weed plants/patches identified in objective (ii). ...|$|E
