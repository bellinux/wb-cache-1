50|$|A {{case that}} deals with the limited powers of a <b>bare</b> <b>trustee</b> to deal with trust assets is Caterpillar Financial Australia Ltd v Ovens Nominees Pty Ltd 2011 FCA 677 which {{considered}} the law relating to the duties, powers and rights of a <b>bare</b> <b>trustee</b> in a winding up. This case is an important reminder to practitioners {{of some of the}} difficulties that can arise where an insolvent company owns property as a corporate trustee. Care should be taken to carefully review the trust deed on appointment to ensure the trustee retains its powers to sell trust assets.|$|E
50|$|The House of Lords, {{by three}} to two, found that Vandervell was indeed liable to pay {{tax on the}} £245,000 of {{dividends}} given to the Royal College of Surgeons. The House of Lords held that the Law of Property Act 1925, section 53(1)(c), was not applicable to situations where a beneficiary directs his trustees, by way of his Saunders v Vautier right to do so, to transfer full legal and equitable ownership to someone else. The case is a proposition that an oral declaration to a <b>bare</b> <b>trustee</b> to transfer the trust property to a third party absolutely for his own benefit is a valid disposition. However, Vandervell had not successfully divested himself of ownership (legal and equitable) in the shares, since the Trust Company had an option to purchase the shares back from the RCS. If the settlor does not divest himself adequately as in Vanderwell v IRC a resulting trust would operate. The option to purchase a substantial fraction of the company for only £5000 was extremely valuable. As such, Vandervell was liable to pay surtax on the option.|$|E
5000|$|Towards {{the end of}} his life, and of the king's, {{when the}} Privy Chamber {{financial}} system was in operation, Hugh Denys purchased interests in several manors, in some possibly as a <b>bare</b> <b>trustee</b> for another beneficial owner. A <b>bare</b> <b>trustee</b> is someone who holds assets for the benefit of a third party purely on personal trust, no legal agreement or documentation existing. It is interesting to speculate who the beneficial owner might have been; one possibility is Henry VII himself. Denys {{does not seem to have}} been a rich man himself, being a second son he would have had no inheritance, and his wife was the daughter of a younger son too. Yet he purchased ostensibly in his own name for his own beneficial interest, some very substantial properties, via a large group of [...] "feoffees" [...] or trustees, especially those purchased from Lord Gray. One of the feoffees in the Shenley purchase was Edmund Dudley, who was the first president of the [...] "Council Learned in the Law" [...] set up by the king in the last years of his life, which David Starkey explains as a private slush fund for the king, reducing his need to consult Parliament in order to raise revenues. The funds were generated by the imposition of [...] "bonds" [...] on those who were fined, often arbitrarily, for offences real or imaginary. Records exist which show these large sums were handed over regularly to Denys, the head of the Privy Chamber. Naturally the money needed investing somewhere, to generate income. A manor was then the closest equivalent to a stock exchange company. It was a going concern, with tenants, managers (i.e. stewards, bailiffs, etc.) and was fully staffed. The steward had only to redirect the stream of net profits to the new owner, as companies alter their dividend payments today to the bank accounts of new shareholders. Denys and his feoffees would receive the income directly into the Privy Purse, controlled by the head of the Privy Chamber, Denys himself, who, of course, was completely trusted by the king in handling his personal money. Thus, the king's revenue from extra-parliamentary fines was capitalised in real estate producing an income received directly by officers of the Privy Purse. It is significant that on Denys's death the properties held under this system of feoffees, in Denys's name, did not descend to Denys's heir, John Denys of Pucklechurch (as did apparently only Purleigh), but went to religious institutions with royal connections. This may have been the feoffees carrying out the secret wishes of the king, expressed to them verbally as his bare trustees. Such a system, based on trust alone, could clearly only function if staffed by the king's closest, most trusted aides. Hence the Groom of the Stool was the perfect candidate to control the operation, as a man of discretion, an intimate companion of the king, long in his confidence, probably without strong personal ambition, therefore trustworthy.|$|E
5000|$|The Tudor {{historian}} David Starkey {{describes this}} system, and Denys's role in it, as follows:In 1493 Henry VII had broken with tradition {{and set up}} a new department of the Royal Household. Historically there were 2 of these, the Lord Steward's dept. which provided food and drink, and the Lord Chamberlain's which dealt with both ceremony and the King's personal service. To these Henry added a third: the secret or Privy Chamber. This took over responsibility for the King's body service. It was also used, as its name indicates, to enforce a much more rigorous separation between the King's public and private lives. The establishment of the secret chamber greatly expanded the Groom's importance and his portfolio. Denys became the head officer of the new department. He controlled access to the King and assumed responsibility for the King's everyday necessities. Denys became the King's personal treasurer, running an account that later became known as the Privy Purse. In the last few years of Henry's reign, avarice was erected into a policy and the result was a reign of terror. The means employed were two financial instruments known as bonds and recognisances, which are agreements with penalty clauses for non-compliance. Individuals were fined for offences real or imaginary, forced pay part immediateley and to enter into bonds to pay the balance the terms imposed were broken. He was therefore at the King's mercy. The arrangements were assessed and enforced by a sub-committee of the King's Council called the Council Learned in the Law, headed by Edmund Dudley, with Sir Richard Empson as a powerful member. In the Autumn of 1508, Denys moved centre stage as the King recovered from a serious illness and decided on a wholesale extension of his policy of fiscal terrorism. Henry decided to cast his net wider than just the elite, and created the post of Surveyor of the King's Prerogative, charged with the rigorous and universal enforcement of the King's rights as head of the feudal system. Local commissioners were appointed under Edward Belknap to enforce the policy on a county by county basis. All the elements of an alternative system of taxation were in place, permanent, nation-wide and exempt from either parliamentary authority or scrutiny. The terms of Belknap's appointment are silent on what became of his profits, but it soon became clear they were to be paid over directly to Denys as a kind of private royal slush fund. Where they were paid is interesting, some at Greenwich Palace, but some at the private royal residences of Wanstead (of which Denys was the official keeper) and Hanworth. The last recording of such a paying-over of [...] "fines assessed by the King's highness" [...] was that paid by Belknap to Denys at Hanworth in February 1509, at which date the account book breaks off, incompleteIt is clear that Denys re-invested these funds in real-estate as a <b>bare</b> <b>trustee</b> for the King, using a group of feoffees many of whom were close to the King. That is to say the King must have had absolute confidence in him that he would not misappropriate the funds, for as a <b>bare</b> <b>trustee</b> no written agreement would have existed.|$|E
40|$|In {{commercial}} structures {{legal title}} to assets is often held in bare trust. There are various reasons for doing so. The motivation {{may be a}} desire for anonymity. An express trust bare trust can be an efficient entity for pooling income yielding assets. In all instances it is intended {{that the benefits of}} ownership will pass more-or-less seamlessly to the beneficiary, {{who may or may not}} also be the settlor. The issue from a GST perspective is whether this goal may be attained. There are no statutory references to bare trusts in the GST Act. This raises the first issue. What is, or is not, a bare trust largely depends on the statutory context in which the term appears. There are several possibilities. If the term does not appear in the GST Act, which meaning does it take for GST purposes? Further uncertainties are apparent. Can a <b>bare</b> <b>trustee</b> also be regarded as an agent at law? Is a <b>bare</b> <b>trustee</b> an entity for GST purposes? Can a <b>bare</b> <b>trustee</b> carry on an enterprise and hence be registered? Is the settlement of legal title in bare trust "a supply" by the settlor? If so, is there consideration for that supply such that it could be a taxable supply? Can input tax credits be claimed on third party supplies to the <b>bare</b> <b>trustee?</b> If so, which entity can claim them? Further, what is the Australian Taxation Office's published view on these issues? There is, at least, a known answer to that question: it does not have one. Therefore, how does it administer the GST law...|$|E
