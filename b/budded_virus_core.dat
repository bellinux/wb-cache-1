40|$|AbstractAutographa californica M nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) open {{reading frame}} 109 (ac 109) is conserved in all known {{baculovirus}} genomes, suggesting {{a crucial role in}} virus replication. Although viruses lacking ac 109 have been previously characterized, the phenotypes differ from production of non-infectious virions to lack of virion production. To re-examine ac 109 function, we constructed a recombinant AcMNPV bacmid, AcBAC 109 KO, with a deletion in ac 109. We did not detect infectious <b>budded</b> <b>virus</b> after transfection of AcBAC 109 KO DNA into cells. In the nucleus, nucleocapsids had envelopment defects and polyhedra lacked virions. DNA synthesis and gene expression between AcBAC 109 KO and a control virus were similar. However, lower levels of non-infectious <b>budded</b> <b>virus</b> were detected from AcBAC 109 KO DNA-transfected cells compared to the parental virus using Q-PCR to detect viral DNA or by immunoblotting to detect a <b>budded</b> <b>virus</b> protein. Therefore, deletion of ac 109 affects envelopment of nucleocapsids in the nucleus and the production of infectious <b>budded</b> <b>virus...</b>|$|R

It also synthesized less polyhedra, but displayed enhanced <b>budded</b> <b>virus</b> formation in TN- 368 cells. This phenotype resulted from dual mutations in p 35 and FP- 25. In {{this study we}} showed that enhanced <b>budded</b> <b>virus</b> production occurs because the hourly rate of release of virus from AcdefrT-infected cells is higher than that for AcMNPV and it continues for longer. This may be the trigger for the induction of apoptosis late in AcdefrT-infected TN- 368 cells. However, laddering of host DNA was absent in TN- 368 cells infected with AcdefrT, but was observed in Spodoptera frugiperda cells. Very late polyhedrin protein production and occlusion body formation was reduced in AcdefrT-infected TN- 368 cells, but chitinase and capsid late gene expression remained unchanged. The AcdefrT was rescued {{with a copy of}} a baculovirus iap 3, to replace the absent p 35. This modification abolished most plasma membrane blebbing in AcdefrT-infected TN- 368 cells, but did not affect enhanced <b>budded</b> <b>virus</b> production.

Marker rescue mapping and DNA sequencing correlated a single nucleotide substitution within the baculovirusgp 41 gene with the temperature-sensitive phenotype oftsB 1074. The product of thegp 41 gene, GP 41, is an O-glycosylated protein found in occluded but not budded virions [M. Whitford and P. Faulkner (1992) J. Virol. 66, 3324 – 3329]. However, <b>budded</b> <b>virus</b> was not produced intsB 1074 -infected cells at the nonpermissive temperature of 33 °, indicating an additional role for GP 41 in <b>budded</b> <b>virus</b> formation.

We evaluated early predictive efficacy of serum hepatitis C <b>virus</b> <b>core</b> antigen kinetics on sustained virologic response in patients with genotype 1 hepatitis C virus during pegylated interferon plus ribavirin treatment. For 478 patients recruited, hepatitis C virus RNAs were detected at baseline, and at weeks 4, 12, 24, 48, and 72 using Cobas TaqMan. Architect hepatitis C <b>virus</b> <b>core</b> antigen was performed at baseline, and weeks 4 and 12. Predictive values of hepatitis C <b>virus</b> <b>core</b> antigen on sustained virologic response were compared to hepatitis C virus RNA. In the first 12 weeks after treatment initiation the dynamic patterns of serum hepatitis C <b>virus</b> <b>core</b> antigen and hepatitis C virus RNA levels were similar in sustained virologic response, relapse, and null response patients groups. Although areas under the receiver operating characteristics curves of hepatitis C <b>virus</b> <b>core</b> antigen were {{lower than those of}} hepatitis C virus RNA at the same time points, modeling analysis showed that undetectable hepatitis C <b>virus</b> <b>core</b> antigen (rapid virological response based on hepatitis C <b>virus</b> <b>core</b> antigen) had similar positive predictive value on sustained virologic response to hepatitis C virus RNA at week 4 (90. 4 % vs 93. 3 %), and hepatitis C <b>virus</b> <b>core</b> antigen decrease greater than 1 log 10 IU/mL (early virological response based on hepatitis C <b>virus</b> <b>core</b> antigen) had similar negative predictive value to hepatitis C virus RNA at week 12 (94. 1 % vs 95. 2 %).

When added after 4 hr of infection, the drug {{had no effect}} on the rate of viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis, although marked inhibition of protein synthesis was seen. All of the previously identified forms of SFV RNA were seen in the drug-treated cells at higher concentrations than were present in untreated controls. The latter observation appeared to result from a failure to form viral “cores” or nucleocapsids in the cycloheximide-treated cells, resulting in sequestration of viral RNA intracellularly. The failure to form new <b>virus</b> <b>cores</b> was correlated with the failure of type II cytopathic vacuoles to appear in thin sections. <b>Virus</b> <b>budding</b> from the cell surface and the formation of type I cytopathic vacuoles persisted in cycloheximide-treated cells.

In order to investigate the intracellular localization of Hepatitis C <b>virus</b> <b>core</b> protein, we have used a lentiviral system to transduce Jurkat T cells and subsequently localize the protein using immunoelectron microscopy techniques.

This analysis showed that the cellular protein, β-tubulin, co-purified with EXON 0 which was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. In addition, immunofluorescence showed that EXON 0 and β-tubulin co-localized during virus infection. The microtubule inhibitors colchicine and nocodazole were used to treat AcMNPV infected Sf 9 cells and results showed that BV production was reduced by over 85 %.

40|$|Mammalian {{cells are}} capable of {{delivering}} multiple types of membrane capsules extracellularly. The limiting membrane of late endosomes can fuse with the plasma membrane, leading to the extracellular release of multivesicular bodies (MVBs), initially contained within the endosomes, as exosomes. <b>Budding</b> <b>viruses</b> exploit the TSG 101 protein and endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery used for MVB formation to mediate the egress of viral particles from host cells. Here we report {{the discovery of a}} virus-independent cellular process that generates microvesicles that are distinct from exosomes and which, like <b>budding</b> <b>viruses,</b> are produced by direct plasma membrane budding. Such budding is driven by a specific interaction of TSG 101 with a tetrapeptide PSAP motif of an accessory protein, arrestin domain-containing protein 1 (ARRDC 1), which we show is localized to the plasma membrane through its arrestin domain. This interaction results in relocation of TSG 101 from endosomes to the plasma membrane and mediates the release of microvesicles that contain TSG 101, ARRDC 1, and other cellular proteins. Unlike exosomes, which are derived from MVBs, ARRDC 1 -mediated microvesicles (ARMMs) lack known late endosomal markers. ARMMs formation requires VPS 4 ATPase and is enhanced by the E 3 ligase WWP 2, which interacts with and ubiquitinates ARRDC 1. ARRDC 1 protein discharged into ARMMs was observed in co-cultured cells, suggesting a role for ARMMs in intercellular communication. Our findings reveal an intrinsic cellular mechanism that results in direct budding of microvesicles from the plasma membrane, providing a formal paradigm for the evolutionary recruitment of ESCRT proteins in the release of <b>budding</b> <b>viruses...</b>|$|R

The m. o. i. appeared to influence the magnitude but not timing of early events in the viral infection cycle (gp 64 expression and DNA synthesis) and also influenced the initial levels of BV production and the percentage of cells containing occlusion bodies. The m. o. i, had little influence on the final rates of BV production and the time of detection of p 39 and polyhedrin on Western blots...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{concentration}} of double-stranded RNA within the bluetongue <b>virus</b> <b>core</b> renders the genome segments liquid crystalline. Powder diffraction rings confirm this local ordering with a 30 Å separation between strands. Determination {{of the structure}} of the bluetongue <b>virus</b> <b>core</b> serotype 10 and comparison with that of serotype 1 reveals most of the genomic double-stranded RNA, packaged as well-ordered layers surrounding putative transcription complexes at the apices of the particle. The outer layer of RNA is sufficiently well ordered by interaction with the capsid that a model can be built and extended to the less-ordered inner layers, providing a structural framework for understanding the mechanism of this complex transcriptional machine. We show that the genome segments maintain local order during transcription...|$|R
