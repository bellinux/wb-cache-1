The enhanced model was used to numerically analyze the physiological balance between the processes of bone apposition and resorption and material resorption in a bone sample under plain stress state. The specimen was constituted by a portion of bone living tissue and one of bio-resorbable material and was acted by an in-plane loading condition. The signal intensity between sensor cells and actor cells was assumed to decrease exponentially with their distance; the effects of adopting two different laws, namely an absolute and a quadratic functions, were compared. Ranges of load magnitudes were identified within which physiological states are established. A parametric analysis was carried out to evaluate the sensitivity of the model to changes of some critical quantities within physiological ranges, namely resorption rate of <b>bio-material,</b> load level and homeostatic strain.

40|$|An {{optically}} active <b>bio-material</b> {{is created}} by blending natural silk fibers with photoisomerizable chromophore molecules—azobenzenebromide (AzBr). The material converts the energy of unpolarized light directly into mechanical work with a well-defined direction of action. The feasibility of the idea to produce optically driven microsized actuators {{on the basis of}} <b>bio-material</b> (silk) is proven. The switching behavior of the embedded AzBr molecules was studied in terms of UV/Vis spectroscopy. To test the opto-mechanical properties of the modified fibers and the structural changes they undergo upon optically induced switching, single fiber X-ray diffraction with a micron-sized synchrotron radiation beam was combined in situ with optical switching as well as with mechanical testing and monitoring. The crystalline regions of silk are not modified by the presence of the guest molecules, hence occupy only the amorphous part of the fibers. It is shown that chromophore molecules embedded into fibers can be reversibly switched between the trans and cis conformation by illumination with light of defined wavelengths. The host fibers respond to this switching with a variation of the internal stress. The amplitude of the mechanical response is independent of the applied external stress and its characteristic time is shorter than the relaxation time of the usual mechanical response of silk...|$|E

40|$|The {{studies were}} {{undertaken}} to generate bio-char from crop residues using {{two different types}} of heating systems, namely external and internal, of pyrolysis. Char from different crop residues like, pigeon-pea, cotton and soybean residues were produced and characterized. For experiments on pyrolysis of crop residues at different temperature, an externally heated vertical cylinder bio-char reactor was developed. The effects of temperature on the yield and the stability of the char were investigated. It could be established that the stability of the char is positively correlated with the pyrolysis temperature; higher pyrolysis temperature gives more stable bio-char. Pigeon pea stalks were found as better <b>bio-material</b> for bio-char generation than the cotton stalk and soybean straw. The carbon contents of the char from the pigeon pea stalk and soybean straw were similar. The pyrolysis process temperature was found appropriate in the range of 350 to 450 °C for obtaining the stable char to act as bio-char. The stability of bio-char was found maximum for bio-char prepared at temperature 450 °C. The gain of carbon in soil due to incorporation of soybean char was found as 91 % higher in comparison to add the raw <b>bio-material.</b> This gain was highest for soybean straw char amongst three crop residues studied.
