40|$|The {{research}} {{detailed in}} this thesis is {{an investigation of the}} chemistry, applications, and methods for the synthesis of graphene oxide (GO), GO derivatives, graphite derivatives, carbon <b>black</b> <b>derivatives,</b> and activated charcoal derivatives, with an emphasis on applications relevant to the oil and gas industry. More particularly, the research involves a method for the rapid purification of GO; the use of GO and GO derivatives in oil-drilling fluids; the use of activated charcoal and carbon black for asphaltene inhibition; and the synthesis of nanoplatelets from an H 2 SO 4 /SO 3 /SO 5 - graphite intercalation compound and their application as conductivity enhancers in oil-based drilling fluids. Although many applications for GO {{have been reported in the}} literature, development of these applications on an industrial scale is held back by the lack of scalable procedures for the purification of GO after synthesis. A scheme for scalable purification is presented in Chapter 1. Suspensions of the resulting GO were tested for rheology and radionuclide uptake. One of the many possible industrial applications of GO and GO-derived products are their use in oil-drilling formulations also known as “drilling muds”. In Chapter 2, the performance of GO and chemically converted graphene as fluid loss control (FLC) agents and rheological modifiers in water-based mud (WBM) is investigated. Large-flake GO was found to be the best FLC additive in fresh-water mud (FWM), and five times more efficient as a rheological modifier than materials used in current FWM formulations. When WBM cannot be used for drilling, and oil-based mud (OBM) needs to be used instead, the reduced performance of resistivity-based imaging tools is of concern. In order to improve their performance, the electrical permittivity of the oil-based medium needs to be improved without disrupting the chemical equilibrium of the drilling formulation. For this purpose, a new method for the synthesis of graphite-derived nanoplatelets was studied (Chapter 3), and their performance as conductivity enhancers in OBM was investigated (Chapter 4). As an additional application of carbonaceous nanoparticles to the oilfield, the use of carbon black and activated charcoal particles for the inhibition, prevention or remediation of asphaltene deposition was investigated (Chapter 5). It was found that these nanoparticles can help stabilize, or controllably precipitate, asphaltenes by virtue of their high surface area, and by being a thermodynamically preferable surface for asphaltene deposition. Early collaborative works with a significant contribution by the author are included in Chapter 6 and Chapter 7.

The total phenolics content ranged from 3. 2 (green gooseberries) to 13. 5 (black currants) mg/g fruit fresh weight. No correlation was found between total phenolics and antioxidant activity. The major phenolic compounds were quercetin <b>derivatives</b> (<b>black</b> currants and green gooseberries) and chlorogenic acid (red currants and red gooseberries). Red currants had the highest alpha-glucosidase, alpha-amylase and ACE inhibitory activities. Therefore red currants could be good dietary sources with potential antidiabetes and antihypertension functionality to compliment overall dietary management of early stages of type 2 diabetes.

However, <b>derivatives</b> of gab are not close to derivatives of g (0) ab, so there can be significant differences in the behavior of geodesics and huge differences in curvature. Consequently, observable quantities in the actual universe may differ significantly from the corresponding observables in the FLRW model.

40|$|Inspired by {{possibility}} that the Schwarzschild black hole {{may not be the}} unique spherically symmetric vacuum solution to generalisations of general relativity, we consider black holes in pure fourth order higher derivative gravity treated as an effective theory. Such solutions may be of interest in addressing the issue of higher derivative hair or during the later stages of black hole evaporation. Non-Schwarzschild solutions have been studied but we have put earlier results on a firmer footing by finding a systematic asymptotic expansion for the black holes and matching them with known numerical solutions obtained by integrating out from the near horizon region. These asymptotic expansions can be cast in the form of trans-series expansions which we conjecture will be a generic feature of non-Schwarzschild higher <b>derivative</b> <b>black</b> holes. Excitingly we find a new branch of solutions with lower free energy than the Schwarzschild solution, but as found in earlier work, solutions only seem to exist for black holes with large curvatures meaning that one should not generically neglect even higher derivative corrections. This suggests that one effectively recovers the non-hair theorems in this context. Comment: 31 pages, 14 figures, v 2 : references added, v 3 : some typos corrected, clarifications adde...|$|R

40|$|Interior {{temperature}} of automobiles and buildings may reach an uncomfortable level during hot weather, which requires {{the use of}} air-conditioners. The solar heating of automobiles and buildings can be partly reduced if the incident solar radiations can be reflected back to the atmosphere. One way to achieve this is to replace the traditional pigments used in surface coatings by NIR (near infrared) -reflective pigments as they keep the surface cool by rejecting significant amounts of NIR-radiations of the solar spectrum. There are many commercially available NIR-reflecting pigments to date but most of them are inorganic, heavy metals based and are not environment friendly. Among the organic pigments, the use of perylene pigments in the NIR-reflective coatings has been described in few patents. However there is no systematic study in the open literature regarding the influence of different factors such as particle size, pigment concentration, electronic influence of different substituents and degree of crystallinity on their NIR-reflectance. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop understanding of the effect of these factors on the NIR-reflectance of perylene based pigments which would help to develop perylene based pigments with significant reflectance in the NIR-region. Therefore five different perylene derivatives P 1, P 2, P 3, P 4 and P 5 were synthesized and their NIR-reflectance was measured and compared with each other as well as with some commercially available pigments such as carbon black, lumogen and titanium dioxide after their dispersion in polypropylene. The relative reflectance of different diimide derivatives (P 1 -P 4) varied from 38 to 65 at 980 nm wavelength and from 37 to 54 at 1300 nm wavelength; P 1 has shown the highest NIR-reflectance among these derivatives. On the other hand derivative P 5 has shown the least reflectance in the NIR-region. The reflectance of synthesized <b>black</b> coloured <b>derivative</b> P 1 is comparable to that of Lumogen® (LG) at 1300 nm, whereas reflectance of LG drops radically in the wavelength region of 700 - 1000 nm. The particle size and particle size distribution do not seem to be the only contributing factor for this observed difference as all the perylene diimides derivatives (P 1 -P 4) have similar particle size and particle size distribution, yet they show significant variation in their NIR-reflectance. Similarly PTCA and P 5 have similar particle size range but exhibit dramatic difference in their NIR-reflectance. Computational study performed on these derivatives has shown that two of the derivatives P 2 and P 5 have a considerable amount of net dipole moments and low reflectance compared to that of P 1, P 4 and PTCA which have zero net dipole moment and higher NIR-reflectance. This demonstrates the direct impact of the development of net dipole moment in reducing the NIR-reflectance. The results of degree of crystallinity for these derivatives indicate the following order of increasing crystallinity: PTCA&gt;P 3 &gt;P 2 &gt;P 1 &gt;P 4 &gt;P 5 A combination of the effect of three factors i. e. particle size, dipole moment and degree of crystallinity, means that PTCA having smallest particle size, zero dipole moment and high degree of crystallinity has the highest ability to reject NIR-radiations...|$|R
