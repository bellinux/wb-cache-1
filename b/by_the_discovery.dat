5|$|A {{trend towards}} greater {{authenticity}} began after Hammond's orchestrations in the 1970s provided {{a basis for}} staging the work in its original form. This process was further aided <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> in the 1990s of Bizet's 1863 conducting score. In this, the orchestral parts were reduced to six staves, but notes and other markings in the manuscript provided additional clues to the original orchestration.

5|$|After Palmyra's {{destruction}} in 273, {{it became a}} market for villagers and nomads from the surrounding area. The city regained some of its prosperity during the Umayyad era, indicated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of a large Umayyad souq in the colonnaded street. Palmyra was a minor trading center until its {{destruction in}} 1400; according to Sharaf ad-Din Ali Yazdi, Timur's men took 200,000 sheep, and the city was reduced into a settlement on the desert border whose inhabitants herded and cultivated small plots for vegetables and corn.|$|E
5|$|After the Iron Age {{occupation}} {{may have}} {{continued into the}} Roman era indicated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of pottery fragments, a small stone statue of Mars possibly from a Roman temple and coins of Claudius Gothicus and Valentinian II. The site may still have been occupied into the Anglo-Saxon period. Several of the finds were uncovered during excavations by Harold St George Gray in 1922, although the coin dating from around 370 was discovered in 1945 and a Romano-British relief in the inner defensive ditch in 1974. The relief was given to North Somerset Museum, and loaned to Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery.|$|E
5|$|Although {{traditionally}} {{depicted as}} a biped, {{it has been suggested}} since the mid-1970s that Spinosaurus was at least an occasional quadruped. This has been bolstered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of Baryonyx, a relative with robust arms. Because of the mass of the hypothesized fatty dorsal humps of Spinosaurus, Bailey (1997) was open to the possibility of a quadrupedal posture, leading to new restorations of it as such. The hypothesis that Spinosaurus had a typical quadrupedal gait has fallen out of favor, though spinosaurids may have crouched in a quadrupedal posture.|$|E

5|$|Dromaeosaurid fossils {{have been}} found across the globe in North America, Europe, Africa, Japan, China, Mongolia, Manchuria, Madagascar, Argentina, and Antarctica, with fossilized teeth giving {{credence}} {{to the possibility that}} they inhabited Australia as well. They first appeared in the mid-Jurassic Period (late Bathonian stage, about 167 million years ago) and survived {{until the end of the}} Cretaceous (Maastrichtian stage, 66 ma), existing until the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.

5|$|That same year, J.J. Thomson {{conducted}} {{an experiment in}} which he channeled a stream of neon ions through magnetic and electric fields, striking a photographic plate at the other end. He observed two glowing patches on the plate, which suggested two different deflection trajectories. Thomson concluded this was {{because some of the}} neon ions had a different mass.

5|$|The caves {{have been}} used by humans for around 45,000 years, {{demonstrated}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of tools from the Palaeolithic period, along with fossilised animal remains. Evidence of Stone and Iron Age occupation continued into Roman Britain. A corn-grinding mill operated on the resurgent waters of the River Axe as early as the Domesday survey of 1086. The waters of the river are used in a handmade paper mill, the oldest extant in Britain, which began operations circa 1610. The low, constant temperature of the caves means that they can be used for maturing Cheddar cheese.|$|E

Observations of these disks show that the dust grains inside them grow in size on short (thousand-year) time scales, producing 1centimeter sized particles.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Green Line past Anacostia Station was {{complicated}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> {{of a potential}} toxic waste site {{in the path of}} the subway. In June 1991, WMATA discovered that the District of Columbia had dumped 426,000 tons of possibly hazardous incinerator bottom ash in an unused exposed culvert along the subway's potential path near St. Elizabeth's Hospital between 1977 and 1989. The city continued to dump the ash at the site for four years after it learned that WMATA planned to use the site for the Green Line. Experts were concerned that the ash dump contained pockets of methane gas and soluble acid, which would make the site unusable by Metrorail.|$|E
5|$|Even {{with the}} Byzantine {{production}} of silk {{starting in the}} 6th century AD, Chinese varieties were still considered to be of higher quality. This theory is supported <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of a Byzantine solidus minted {{during the reign of}} Justin II found in a Sui-dynasty tomb of Shanxi province in 1953, among other Byzantine coins found at various sites. Chinese histories offer descriptions of Roman and Byzantine coins. The Weilüe, Book of the Later Han, Book of Jin, as well as the later Wenxian Tongkao noted how ten ancient Roman silver coins were worth one Roman gold coin. The Roman golden aureus was worth about twenty-five silver denarii. During the later Byzantine Empire, twelve silver miliaresion was equal to one gold nomisma. The History of Song notes that the Byzantines made coins of either silver or gold, without holes in the middle, with an inscription of the king's name. It also asserts that the Byzantines forbade the production of counterfeit coins.|$|E

5|$|Excavations at {{the pyramid}} of Sahure in Abusir under the {{direction}} of Miroslav Verner and Tarek El-Awady in the early 2000s provide a picture of the royal family of the early 5th Dynasty. In particular, reliefs from the causeway linking the valley and mortuary temples of the pyramid complex reveal that Sahure's mother was queen Neferhetepes II. She was the wife of pharaoh Userkaf, as indicated by the location of her pyramid immediately adjacent to that of Userkaf, which makes Userkaf the father of Sahure in all likelihood. This is further confirmed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of Sahure's cartouche in the mortuary temple of Userkaf at Saqqara, indicating that Sahure finished the structure started most probably by his father.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{short-lived}} relationship with physiotherapist Justin Fuller (Ben Richards), Donna {{moves on to}} date hospital manager Bradley Hume (Scott Adkins).

After entering into a scratchcard syndicate at work, Donna wins £20,000. She refuses to share her winnings with the others and resigns from her job, making plans to travel to Australia.

She goes on to begin an affair with consultant general surgeon Michael Spence (Hari Dhillon), despite the fact he is married. When Michael's wife Annalese (Anna-Louise Plowman) begins working at the hospital as a locum anaesthetist, she suspects that Michael has been unfaithful to her and confronts Donna, who confesses the affair and apologises profusely.|$|E
5|$|In 1945 Deir al-Balah had a {{population}} of 2,560, all Arabs, with 14,735 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 327 dunams were for citrus and bananas, 472 plantations and irrigable land, 14,438 used for cereals, while 39 dunams were built-up land. In the lead-up to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, residents of Deir al-Balah participated in a local attack against the nearby kibbutz of Kfar Darom, despite being discouraged by Egyptian Army officers, but they were repelled and suffered casualties. During the war, Egypt captured the town along with other towns {{in an area that}} became known as the Gaza Strip. The Egyptians later established a sharia court system that held jurisdiction over personal affairs. Egyptian rule introduced relative prosperity to Deir al-Balah. The town witnessed a booming citrus industry made possible <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> of a substantial reservoir of ground water in the vicinity.|$|E
