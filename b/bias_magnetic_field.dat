50|$|Hence, a DC SQUID {{can be used}} as a flux-to-voltage transducer. However, {{as noted}} by the figure, the voltage across the {{electrodes}} oscillates sinusoidally with respect to the amount of magnetic flux passing through the device. As a result, alone a SQUID can only be used to measure the change in magnetic field from some known value, unless the magnetic field or device size is very small such that Φ < Φ0. To use the DC SQUID to measure standard magnetic fields, one must either count the number of oscillations in the voltage as the field is changed, which is very difficult in practice, or use a separate DC <b>bias</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> parallel to the device to maintain a constant voltage and consequently constant magnetic flux through the loop. The strength of the field being measured will then be equal to the strength of the <b>bias</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> passing through the SQUID.|$|E
50|$|Operation of a {{scanning}} SQUID microscope {{consists of}} simply cooling down the probe and sample, and rastering the tip across {{the area where}} measurements are desired. As the change in voltage corresponding to the measured magnetic field is quite rapid, {{the strength of the}} <b>bias</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> is typically controlled by feedback electronics. This field strength is then recorded by a computer system that also keeps track of the position of the probe. An optical camera {{can also be used to}} track the position of the SQUID with respect to the sample.|$|E
50|$|In {{polycrystalline}} material, the magnetostriction {{response is}} very complicated. It {{is affected by}} direction of the bias field, direction of the field from AC electric coil, the strength of bias field, and the amplitude of the AC current. In some cases, one or two peak response may be observed {{with the increase of}} bias field. In some cases, the response can be improved significantly with the change of relative direction between <b>bias</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> and AC magnetic field. Quantitatively, the magnetostriction may be described in a similar mathematical format as piezoelectric constants. Empirically, a lot of experience is needed to fully understand the magnetostriction phenomenon.|$|E

50|$|Although it is {{possible}} to read the DC voltage between the two terminals of the SQUID directly, because noise tends to be a problem in DC measurements, an alternating current technique is used. In addition to the DC <b>bias</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> an AC magnetic field of constant amplitude, with field strength generating Φ << Φ0, is also emitted in the bias coil. This AC field produces an AC voltage with amplitude proportional to the DC component in the SQUID. The advantage of this technique is that the frequency of the voltage signal can be chosen to be far away from that of any potential noise sources. By using a lock-in amplifier the device can read only the frequency corresponding to the magnetic field, ignoring many other sources of noise.|$|E
50|$|The {{resolution}} and {{sensitivity of the}} device are both proportional {{to the size of}} the SQUID. A smaller device will have greater resolution but less sensitivity. The change in voltage induced is proportional to the inductance of the device, and limitations in the control of the <b>bias</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> as well as electronics issues prevent a perfectly constant voltage from being maintained at all times. However, in practice, the sensitivity in most scanning SQUID microscopes is sufficient for almost any SQUID size for many applications, and therefore the tendency is to make the SQUID as small as possible to enhance resolution. Via e-beam lithography techniques it is possible to fabricate devices with total area of 1 - 10 μm2, although devices in the tens to hundreds of square micrometres are more common.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two basic}} {{components}} in an EMAT transducer. One is a magnet {{and the other is}} an electric coil. The magnet can be a permanent magnet or an electromagnet, which produces a static or a quasi-static magnetic field. In EMAT terminology, this field is called <b>bias</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> The electric coil is driven with an alternating current (AC) electric signal at ultrasonic frequency, typically in the range from 20 kHz to 10 MHz. Based on the application needs, the signal can be a continuous wave, a spike pulse, or a tone-burst signal. The electric coil with AC current also generates an AC magnetic field. When the test material is close to the EMAT, ultrasonic waves are generated in the test material through the interaction of the two magnetic fields.|$|E
