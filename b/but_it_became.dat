5|$|In 2007, the {{brothers}} spoke to director Stephen Hopkins about {{moving forward with}} an adaptation again, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> stuck in development hell. The Lunas were still in talks for an Ultra television project in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Extant {{bears are}} found in sixty {{countries}} primarily in the Northern Hemisphere and are concentrated in Asia, North America, and Europe. An exception is the spectacled bear; native to South America, it inhabits the Andean region. The sun bear's range extends below the equator in Southeast Asia. The Atlas bear, a subspecies of the brown bear was distributed in North Africa from Morocco to Libya, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> extinct around the 1870s.|$|E
5|$|The Senne/Zenne (French/Dutch) was {{historically}} {{the main}} waterway of Brussels, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> more polluted and less navigable {{as the city}} grew. By {{the second half of}} the 19th century, it had become a serious health hazard and was filled with pollution, garbage and decaying organic matter. It flooded frequently, inundating the lower town and the working class neighbourhoods which surrounded it.|$|E

5|$|The castle {{remained}} in military ownership, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> {{more of a}} museum from the 1920s onwards. During the Second World War, the castle was still in service {{as part of the}} Magazine Establishment and was damaged by two enemy bombs which fell in 1941. The bombing dislodged pieces of plaster in the castle's south tower and gatehouse, under which were discovered old graffiti, including a drawing of a ship dated to around 1700.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Egyptian was a {{synthetic}} language, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> more analytic later on. Late Egyptian developed prefixal definite and indefinite articles, which replaced the older inflectional suffixes. There {{was a change}} from the older verb–subject–object word order to subject–verb–object. The Egyptian hieroglyphic, hieratic, and demotic scripts were eventually replaced by the more phonetic Coptic alphabet. Coptic is still used in the liturgy of the Egyptian Orthodox Church, and traces of it are found in modern Egyptian Arabic.|$|E
5|$|Belle Vue was {{the first}} privately financed zoo in England, and grew to become the third-largest in the UK. Jennison's {{original}} idea was that the gardens should be primarily a botanical excursion, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> clear that the public {{was interested in the}} animals as an attraction in their own right. The initial collection had consisted of domestic birds and a few exotic parrots, but Jennison probably also acquired those animals that could not be sold after the Manchester Zoological Gardens closed in 1842. By 1856, the Jennisons had added kangaroos, rhinos, lions, bears and gazelles.|$|E

5|$|Both Sherman and McKinley {{sought a}} {{peaceful}} resolution to the Cuban War, preferably involving an independent Cuba without American intervention. The United States and Spain began negotiations on the subject in 1897, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> clear that Spain would never concede Cuban independence, while the rebels (and their American supporters) would never settle for anything less. In January 1898, Spain promised some concessions to the rebels, but when American consul Fitzhugh Lee reported riots in Havana, McKinley agreed to send the battleship USS Maine there to protect American lives and property. On February 15, the Maine exploded and sank with 266 men killed.|$|E
5|$|Harveys Lake was accidentally {{discovered}} by Benjamin Harvey in 1781. The first settlers {{arrived at the}} lake in the 1790s and 1800s. Early industries in the area included lumbering and farming, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> well known as a summer resort {{in the latter part}} of the 1800s and into the 1900s. It was also used as a water supply in the early 1900s. However, the lake began to develop significant environmental problems in the 1960s and a total maximum daily load was created for it in 1994. Since 1968, the lake has been located in the borough of Harveys Lake.|$|E
5|$|Jose Sarria's mother {{continued}} {{to work for the}} Jost family <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> increasingly difficult for her to fulfil her job responsibilities and care for an infant. Maria made arrangements for him to be raised by another couple, Jesserina and Charles Millen. Jesserina had recently lost her youngest child to diphtheria and suffered severe depression. Her doctor suggested she take in another child to raise and after meeting with her Maria agreed to let her raise José. José came to consider the Millens and their children to be his second family. Maria bought a house and moved the Millens and José into it.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the release}} of Ghosts I–IV and The Slip, a 25-date tour titled Lights in the Sky, was {{announced}} in several North American cities, and was later expanded to include several more North American dates as well as dates in South America. Cortini and Josh Freese returned as members from the previous tour, while Robin Finck rejoined the band and Justin Meldal-Johnsen was added on bass guitar. Freese and Cortini left the live band, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> a quartet {{with the addition of}} Ilan Rubin on drums.|$|E
5|$|The Duke {{occupied}} {{the post of}} Lord Warden until 1765, save for two periods when it was filled by James Butler, the Duke of Ormonde and John Sidney, the Earl of Leicester. He carried out extensive work to make the castle more habitable, building extensions towards the north bastion and constructing a small house in the south bastion for the soldiers. Under the subsequent Lord Wardens, the politicians Robert Darcy, the Earl of Holderness, and Francis North, the Earl of Guildford, the castle continued to house artillery <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> increasingly less military in character.|$|E
5|$|The NK 12th Division was {{operating}} in the valley west of P'ohang-dong {{and was able to}} push back Task Force P'ohang and the ROK Capital Division. At the same time, the NK 766th Infantry Regiment and elements of the NK 5th Division fought Task Force Bradley at and south of P'ohang-dong. U.S. naval fire was able to drive NK troops from the town, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> a bitterly contested no man's land as fighting moved to the hills around the town.|$|E

5|$|The St. Procopius Academy {{football}} team played its first game against Downers Grove High School on Thanksgiving Day, 1917. At first some faculty members {{did not approve}} of American football, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> respected on campus in the 1920s {{under the direction of}} Rev. Benedict Bauer. Bauer served as Athletic Director until 1927 while also coaching basketball, baseball, and football, and planned {{the construction of a new}} gymnasium in 1925. The college's varsity baseball team won conference championships in 1924 and 1925, and the {{football team}} defeated the University of Notre Dame freshman team in 1925.|$|E
5|$|The depot {{was located}} in Sporveisgata, between Bergsliens gate and the street {{junction}} Pilestredet–Sporveisgata. The street Sporveisgata was in the beginning only a branch from Pilestredet, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> a street {{in its own right}} in 1879, after the tramway installations had been constructed. While it {{was located in}} a branch to Pilestredet, the depot had Pilestredet 75 as its address. After the branch had its name changed to Sporveisgata, the address was renamed Sporveisgata 8.|$|E
5|$|To {{continue}} the research {{where it would}} not pose a public health hazard, the reactor was disassembled {{and moved to the}} Argonne Woods site. There Fermi directed experiments on nuclear reactions, revelling in the opportunities provided by the reactor's abundant production of free neutrons. The laboratory soon branched out from physics and engineering into using the reactor for biological and medical research. Initially, Argonne was run by Fermi as part of the University of Chicago, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> a separate entity with Fermi as its director in May 1944.|$|E

5|$|Warner Brothers′ {{succession}} of gangster movie hits, in particular Little Caesar with Edward G. Robinson, culminated with the 1931 film The Public Enemy. Due {{to the strong}} reviews in his short film career, Cagney was cast as nice-guy Matt Doyle, opposite Edward Woods as Tom Powers. However, after the initial rushes, each was reassigned the other's part. The film cost only $151,000 to make, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> {{one of the first}} low-budget films to gross $1million.|$|E
5|$|Although Elgar {{is often}} {{regarded}} as a typically English composer, most of his musical influences were not from England but from continental Europe. He felt himself to be an outsider, not only musically, but socially. In musical circles dominated by academics, he was a self-taught composer; in Protestant Britain, his Roman Catholicism was regarded with suspicion in some quarters; and in the class-conscious society of Victorian and Edwardian Britain, he was acutely sensitive about his humble origins even after he achieved recognition. He nevertheless married {{the daughter of a}} senior British army officer. She inspired him both musically and socially, but he struggled to achieve success until his forties, when after a series of moderately successful works his Enigma Variations (1899) became immediately popular in Britain and overseas. He followed the Variations with a choral work, The Dream of Gerontius (1900), based on a Roman Catholic text that caused some disquiet in the Anglican establishment in Britain, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>became,</b> and has remained, a core repertory work in Britain and elsewhere. His later full-length religious choral works were well received but have not entered the regular repertory.|$|E
5|$|At the outset, the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and USCG {{agreed to}} recruit and to train the members of their {{respective}} women's reserves together, using existing Navy facilities. For recruiting purposes, the SPARS would utilize the Offices of the Naval Officer Procurement. Their first recruiting efforts got underway in December 1942, but they were hampered somewhat {{by the absence of}} SPAR recruiting personnel. Their absence resulted from the agreement between the Navy and the USCG, whereby the SPARS would receive its first personnel by transfer from the WAVES. A total of 15 WAVE officers and 153 WAVE enlisted women requested and were discharged from the WAVES to become the first SPARS. Eventually, SPAR officers were assigned to most of the Naval Officer Procurement offices. The recruiting information about SPARS was disseminated with WAVES publicity materials and it was also done separately. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> apparent that the job of selling the SPARS included selling the USCG as well.|$|E
