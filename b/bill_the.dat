5|$|The hookbill's {{distinguishing}} characteristic was a heavy, parrotlike <b>bill.</b> <b>The</b> {{upper mandible}} hooked sharply downwards, while the heavy lower mandible hooked sharply upwards towards {{the middle of}} the upper mandible. This structure left a gap between the two mandibles when the bird held its beak closed. It is believed that the bill was pale pink in coloration. The jaw muscles were particularly well developed around the <b>bill.</b> <b>The</b> hookbill's tongue was primitive and nontubular.|$|E

5|$|The Indian subcontinent is {{the range}} of {{subspecies}} N. p. ginginianus, {{the smallest of the}} three subspecies, which is identifiable by a pale yellow <b>bill.</b> <b>The</b> subspecies name is derived from Gingee in southern India where the French explorer Pierre Sonnerat described it as Le Vautour de Gingi and it was given a Latin name by John Latham in his Index Ornithologicus (1790).|$|E
5|$|The bill {{then goes}} through a third reading. At this stage, only {{amendments}} not of a material character may {{be made to the}} <b>bill.</b> <b>The</b> minister moving the third reading may also make a speech outlining the changes made to the <b>bill.</b> <b>The</b> bill is then put to the vote. In most cases, a simple majority of Parliament is all that is needed for the bill to be approved. However, bills seeking to amend the Constitution must be carried by a special majority: not less than two-thirds of all MPs on the second and third readings.|$|E
5|$|The other subspecies, sclateri, has {{slightly}} longer wings {{and a smaller}} <b>bill.</b> <b>The</b> plumage is less golden, with the forehead and uppertail-coverts being blue-green, and with both the wings and tail being blue-black.

50|$|This bird {{is often}} mistaken for the double-crested {{cormorant}} {{due to its}} similar size and shape, although the two species can be differentiated by their tails and <b>bills.</b> <b>The</b> tail of the anhinga is wider and much longer than that of <b>the</b> cormorant. <b>The</b> <b>bill</b> of <b>the</b> anhinga is pointed, while <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> of <b>the</b> cormorant has a hook-tip.|$|R

Next, the origin and distribution of the species are discussed, with notes or quotations from authorities such as John Ray, Gilbert White and Buffon.|$|E
5|$|This {{pay raise}} {{proposal}} was submitted as {{an amendment to}} the government's general appropriations bill.

5|$|With the {{entering}} of the Green Party into Government in 2007, {{a commitment}} to legislation introducing civil partnerships was agreed in the Programme for Government in June of that year.

5|$|A {{bill was}} passed by both the Dewan Rakyat and Dewan Negara on 19 and 20 January 1993 respectively. The bill, which {{proposed}} to remove legal immunity was approved by six out of nine sultans—but saw stiff opposition from three, two of which included the Ismail Petra, the Sultan of Kelantan and the Sultan Iskandar himself. Sultan Iskandar took up the initiative to obtain more royal support to stall {{the implementation of the}} proposed <b>bill.</b> <b>The</b> bill, which proposed to strip rulers and members of the royal families of legal immunity, would make them prosecutable by the law in any cases of proven criminal wrongdoings.|$|E
5|$|A major {{accomplishment}} of the Johnson administration was {{the passage of}} a legislative redistricting bill. Despite the fact that the U.S. Constitution requires redistricting after every decennial census, Kentucky's legislative districts had remained virtually unchanged between 1893 and 1941. He asked the 1942 legislative session to adjourn early so he could call a special session {{for the sole purpose of}} considering a redistricting <b>bill.</b> <b>The</b> legislators obliged, and passed a bill by the end of the special session.|$|E
5|$|A {{radical change}} of tactics, which {{involved}} {{the introduction of}} a bill to ban British subjects from aiding or participating in the slave trade to the French colonies, was suggested by maritime lawyer James Stephen. It was a shrewd move, since the majority of British ships were now flying American flags and supplying slaves to foreign colonies with whom Britain was at war. A bill was introduced and approved by the cabinet, and Wilberforce and other abolitionists maintained a self-imposed silence, so as not to draw any attention to the effect of the <b>bill.</b> <b>The</b> approach proved successful, and the new Foreign Slave Trade Bill was quickly passed, and received royal assent on 23 May 1806.|$|E
50|$|The Patriots stay at {{home for}} a matchup against <b>the</b> Tyrod Taylor-led <b>Bills.</b> On <b>the</b> first play of scrimmage, Brissett hit Edelman on a 90-yard catch-and-run to <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> 1, but <b>the</b> play was nullified by a holding penalty on former Buffalo Bills player, Chris Hogan.

Starting from their own 35, <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> marched 65 yards in over 7 minutes, scoring on a 7-yard {{touchdown}} pass from Taylor to LeSean McCoy. After a Patriots three-and-out, <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> marched to <b>the</b> Patriots 16, but settled for Dan Carpenters 34-yard field goal on the second play of the second quarter, making the score 10-0. After forcing the Patriots to punt, <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> drove 71 yards and Carpenter ended the drive with a 43-yard field goal, extending the lead to 13-0. The Patriots drove {{all the way to}} <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> 18 on their ensuing possession, but Brissett was strip-sacked by Zach Brown with Preston Brown recovering for <b>the</b> <b>Bills.</b> Starting at their own 9, <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> drove to their own 42, but punted. The Patriots punted as well, and <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> led 13-0 at halftime. After forcing <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> to punt on the opening drive, the Patriots drove to <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> 30, but Gostkowski missed a 48-yard field goal. <b>The</b> <b>Bills</b> countered, reaching <b>the</b> Patriots 29, but then Carpenter missed a 47-yard field goal. After yet another Patriots punt, Ben Tate returned the punt 18 yards to <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> 30. <b>The</b> <b>Bills</b> reached <b>the</b> Patriots 26, and Carpenter nailed a 44-yard field goal stretching the score to 16-0.
