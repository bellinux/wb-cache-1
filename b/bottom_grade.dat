We know {{all too well}} the spatial notions of top and <b>bottom</b> <b>grades,</b> of ‘under’ graduate, ‘foundation’ level, and ‘higher’ education. We assess in different fields and have learned about the ‘spiral’ curriculum’, ‘scaffolded’ learning and ‘zones’ of proximal development (Vygotsky, 1962). There is ‘open’ learning and ‘distance’ learning, ‘threshold’ concepts, ‘core’ subjects, and ‘peripheral’ learning (Lave & Wenger, 1991). Students engage in both ‘vertical’ and ‘horizontal’ learning (Shulman, 1987) and we strive for ‘breadth’ of understanding, ‘depth’ of knowledge and ‘deep’ learning to counteract ‘surface’ learning. Sometimes the language betrays the very social structures we are trying to eradicate: ‘inclusive’ learning suggests the persistence of ‘exclusive’ learning, an ‘in’ to be included into and an’out’ to which others are relegated. Indeed the hierarchical, height-privileged notions of ‘upper’ class, ‘higher’ degrees and ‘foundation’ degrees or ‘bridging’ courses reveal how spatial language ‘can capture us, almost unthinking, in particular, pernicious discourses…’ (Paechter, 2004, p. 458).

50|$|Graded bedding is a sorting of {{particles}} according to clast {{size and shape}} on a lithified horizontal plane. The term is an explanation as to how a geologic profile was formed. Stratification on a lateral plane is the physical result of active depositing of different size materials. Density and gravity forces in the downward movement of these materials in a confined system {{will result in a}} separating of the detritus settling with respect to size. This will result in less dense, higher porosity clasts at the top and denser, less porous clasts consolidated on the bottom, in what is called normal grading. Inversely graded beds are composed of large clasts on the top, with smaller clasts on the <b>bottom.</b> <b>Grades</b> of the bedding material are determined by precipitation of solid components compared to the viscosity of the medium in which the particles will precipitate from. Steno’s Principle of Original Horizontality explains that rock layers form in horizontal layers over an underdetermined time scale and depth. Nicholas Steno first published his hypothesis in 1669 after recognizing that fossils were preserved in layers of rock (strata).|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{development}} and succession of British Electricity Industry executives (top managers) during the half-century from 1948, and examines the reasons why few female employees became senior managers, and none became board members. In response to the continuing need for professional engineers, the industry operated a policy of internal promotion in parallel with systematic procedures for recruiting, training, developing and promoting employees and managers. The shortage of technical trainees resulted in the recruitment of apprentices with qualifications below the required standard; together with talented manual workers who were also perceived as potential engineers. Training facilities and career development opportunities were biased in favour of technical employees whose occupations were horizontally and vertically segregated. The term 'manager' was strictly limited to an elite of 1 in 100 employees, distinguished from the 1000 s of supervisors (1 in 14 employees). The career trajectory to management was multifaceted until a standard was introduced in 1968. The federal nature of the industry resulted in inequalities with particular biases in training and selection to attend business schools. Managers who attended the Administrative Staff College at Henley were more successful in achieving promotion, especially {{to the level of}} chairmen, when compared with managers who attended an internal course. Using questionnaire results the thesis highlights differences between managers and top managers in relation to their personal characteristics, career development (including motivation and managing), and techniques for management selection and succession. The impact of privatisation on career development is also considered. An analysis of management succession over five decades shows that early entry to the industry was correlated with success; the long tenure of the first entrants hindered subsequent succession except for the most mobile. Like the industry's leaders, membership of decision-making committees which influenced female development was also male dominated. This belied the fact that females formed one in ten of non-executive board members. There is a substantial literature on the historical problems of women in work, their concentration in low-paid, low-status posts, employability and exclusion from higher graded posts. The electricity industry is a case in point. In electricity the focus was on boys and young men to fill the horizontally segregated technical training posts at a time when females were actively encouraged to follow a 'feminine' curriculum in schools. In addition, workshop and practical training facilities for females were non-existent in an industry which, unsurprisingly, perceived they would find its workplaces 'unattractive'. Females were concentrated in lower grade clerical work and in the <b>bottom</b> <b>grades</b> of the higher graded administrative structure. Due to the federal nature of the industry the finding that females were discriminated against remained unresolved. Privatisation did nothing to improve the gender imbalance in managerial opportunity. Some females now perform manual jobs previously confined to men, and two women became executive board members. However, by 1998, despite the more widespread use of the term 'manager' a number of electricity companies had still not appointed any senior female managers...|$|R
40|$|Classic {{theories}} depict adolescence as {{a period}} of emotional "storm and stress". Empirical evidence, mostly from cross-sectional studies, suggests that emotional development presents a mixture of continuity, swings, and resilience. We examined longitudinally the average grade trends in components of self-concept and experiential components of self-worth and affect across adolescence. We followed 1, 165 6 th through 12 th graders for 4 years using a 3 -wave, accelerated longitudinal design. Participants completed self-concept scales (global self-esteem and locus of control), and the Experience Sampling Method, which provided daily self- reports on self-worth (living up to one’s own expectations, to the expectations of others, feeling successful, and feeling {{in control of the}} situation) and affect (feeling good about oneself and feeling happy). Multilevel modeling indicated that both self-esteem and locus of control grow linearly over time. Self-worth components of experience showed a concave-up trend <b>bottoming</b> around <b>Grade</b> 10, suggesting a pubertal swing and partial readjustment by the end of adolescence. Affect declined quadratically across adolescence. Compared to White students, less positive grade trends were found for Hispanics, Asian Americans, and adolescents from nontraditional families. A mixed pattern emerged for African Americans. Behind the stable growth of components of self-concept, adolescents experience a certain degree of discontinuity as to how they evaluate their capability to meet everyday life demands and their affect declines. The modifications in grade trends due to ethnicity and family structure call for studies on the possible influence exercised by family processes and school environments...|$|R
40|$|The {{lack of an}} {{engaging}} pedagogy and the highly competitive atmosphere in introductory science courses tend to discourage students from pursuing STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) majors. Once in a STEM field, academic and social integration has been long thought to be important for students' persistence. Yet, it is rarely investigated. In particular, the relative impact of in-class and out-of-class interactions remains an open issue. Here, we demonstrate that, surprisingly, for students whose grades fall in the "middle of the pack," the out-of-class network {{is the most significant}} predictor of persistence. To do so, we use logistic regression combined with Akaike's Information Criterion to assess in- and out-of-class networks, grades, and other factors. For students with grades at the very top (and <b>bottom),</b> final <b>grade,</b> unsurprisingly, is the best predictor of persistence [...] these students are likely already committed (or simply restricted from continuing) so they persist (or drop out). For intermediate grades, though, only out-of-class closeness [...] a measure of one's immersion in the network [...] helps predict persistence. This does not negate the need for in-class ties. However, it suggests that, in this cohort, only students that get past the convenient in-class interactions and start forming strong bonds outside of class are or become committed to their studies. Since many students are lost through attrition, our results suggest practical routes for increasing students' persistence in STEM majors.

Also, in a pusher role, it was possible for the helper/banker to easily separate once the train had crested the grade. Once separated, the banker would return to a siding or stub so as to clear the mainline and get ready for the next train. A common practice with knuckle couplers was to remove the knuckle from the front coupler. The locomotive would be brought up behind the last car of the train while the train was moving slowly. The air brake hose would not be coupled.

50|$|Snow tubing {{is rumored}} to have begun {{as far back as}} the 1820s in the Alpine Mountains. Tubing on snow is a wintertime {{activity}} that is similar to sledding. This kind of tubing is almost always performed on a hill or slope, using gravity to propel the rider to the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>grade.</b> The rider often returns to the top of the slope with the tube to repeat the process. The low amount of friction between most tubes and snow allows tubers to reach considerable speeds while riding, especially on steep slopes. Because of the circular shape of snow tubes, controlling the course and speed of a tube while riding on snow is extremely difficult. While a sled rider can drag their arms on the snow to brake or steer to a degree, attempting this on a tube will often cause the tube to spin. This lack of control has led to injuries, some serious, when riders have struck obstacles such as trees while tubing on snow.|$|R
2500|$|Early freight {{operations}} {{consisted of}} trains {{of fewer than}} twenty cars, for the cars were weak and the locomotives small. The hilly terrain over which the BR routes ran posed problems, especially {{in the days before}} steel rolling stock. To negotiate these grades, the railroad needed to use helpers and pushers. If the second (or third) engine were put {{at the head of the}} train, then too much weight aft might result in a broken coupler and the lethal problem of a runaway. If the additional power were at the back end, then the soft wood cars tended to buckle under the compression. Occasionally, a compromise would put the helper locomotive at or near the center of the train. Using helpers brought an additional problem. Since these engines were needed only on steeper grades and since the railroad would never countenance the expense of a second engine and crew on the entire run, the helpers had to return to the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>grade</b> for the next heavy train needing a push. At first, this meant running backward after uncoupling from the rear of the train. The BR discouraged backward running as bad practice, a problem that eventually was solved with the construction of wyes for turning around. Additionally, care had to be exercised to avoid placing a caboose between a pusher and a train, as this crushed the soft cabooses.|$|R
