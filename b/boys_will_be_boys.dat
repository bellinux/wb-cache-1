2500|$|His {{first film}} {{for the film}} studio was <b>Boys</b> <b>Will</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Boys,</b> in which the {{screenplay}} was written by Hay himself, the film's satirical approach towards {{the public school system}} was loosely based on the humor of the Daily Express columnist, Beachcomber. The film was widely {{regarded as one of the}} most subversive of its time due to the satire towards how authority is portrayed in the film, and was granted an A (adult) certificate by the British Board of Film Classification. <b>Boys</b> <b>Will</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Boys</b> is widely regarded as Hay's break-out film, writing for The Spectator, Graham Greene characterised the film as [...] "very amusing", describing Hay's portrayal of Dr. Smart as [...] "competent" [...] and praised Claude Dampier's portrayal of Second Master Finch (Hay's adversary) as the film's [...] "finest performance". Several years later, the Radio Times Guide to Films gave <b>Boys</b> <b>Will</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Boys</b> three stars out of five, observing that the film contains [...] "the blend of bluster and disthonesty that makes his films irresistible".|$|E
2500|$|The {{prosecution}} {{alleged that}} Jackson showed pornography to children at Neverland, including the accuser and his brother. [...] The raids on Neverland produced {{an accumulation of}} ten years' worth of heterosexual adult magazines such as Playboy, Penthouse and Hustler along with various heterosexual pornographic videos and websites on his computer. The prosecution alleged these were used for grooming young victims. [...] Brett Barnes and Wade Robson, two {{men who had been}} friends with Jackson since childhood, testified that they had not been [...] "aware that [...] possessed sexually explicit material" [...] until the trial. There were also a few books seized (from a library of thousands) that the prosecution suggested were evidence of homosexuality and/or pedophilia. [...] <b>Boys</b> <b>Will</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Boys</b> included pictures of boys, many naked, in various non-sexual activities such as climbing a tree or sitting on a bench. The book had an inscription reading, [...] "To Michael: From your fan. Love XXXOOO Rhonda – 1983, Chicago." [...] Wade Robson testified he considered <b>Boys</b> <b>Will</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Boys</b> [...] "not a pornographic book," [...] and said he would not be concerned about its owner being in the same bed with a 12-year-old. Another book, The Boy: A Photographic Essay, was inscribed, [...] "Look at the true spirit of happiness and joy in these boys' faces. This is the spirit of boyhood, a life I never had and will always dream of. This is the life I want for my children. MJ." [...] The book contained pictures of boys in various situations by different photographers, including pictures taken during the filming of the 1963 Lord of the Flies film and showed the boys on the set, usually clothed but sometimes nude, playing in the sand, reading comic books, and having pillow fights. The only book depicting male sex acts was a rare, out-of-print book called A Sexual Study of Man which featured many images of adult men engaged in all kinds of homosexual intercourse. [...] Robson said he would be concerned if the book's owner were to share his bed with a boy, but amended that he would not mind if he considered the total picture of all the material in question. [...] Robson testified that he believed Jackson had a [...] "sexual interest in women," [...] and that he had never seen [...] "anything that suggested pedophilia" [...] at Neverland. [...] Jackson's multiple residences were searched numerous times by various agencies over a period of days, without any child pornography ever being found. The FBI analyzed sixteen computers and found [...] "nothing notable" [...] contained in their files.|$|E

As labour <b>boys</b> <b>are</b> put under persistent/severe {{physical}} stress, we hypothesised, {{that it may}} result in higher levels of cortisol and exhaust glycogen, fats and protein. Depletion of fats may result in lower body weight, and insufficient leptin concentrations could excite gonadotropic releasing hormone (GnRH) at normal time of puberty in working boys. Moreover, lower testosterone levels in working boys, due to delayed puberty, may result in suppression of somatotropic axis. Short/weak stature and failure of onset of puberty may cause poor performance, inferiority complex and psychological disorders. Therefore, {{the present study is}} designed to find out the timing of onset of puberty in working <b>boys.</b> The study <b>will</b> include 10 – 18 years of working boys as case and non-working boys of the same age group as control. Working <b>boys</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> labour <b>boys,</b> while the control group <b>will</b> not <b>be</b> involved in physical work.

This article analyz. es the effects of wartime reorganisation of labor processes on the hierarchies of gender and skill that shaped the metalworking factories of France and Britain. Pressed by the soaring demand for weapons at the very moment when much of their traditional (skilled male) workforce had left for the front, wartime employers found themselves experimenting with new technologies of work even as they introduced female workers en masse. Employers thus reorganized productive hierarchies and allocated tasks between the sexes in accordance with their understanding {{of the ways in which}} male-female difference manifested itself on the assembly line or at the machine. The result was a structure of inequality that was taken to be both inevitable and economically rational, anchored in the solid bedrock of "natural" difference and articulated through a newly gendered language of job skill.
