5|$|The IUCN has {{assessed}} the sicklefin lemon shark globally as Vulnerable; it is harvested using anchored and floating gillnets, beach nets, and longlines. The meat is sold fresh or dried and salted for human consumption, the fins used for shark fin soup, and the liver oil is processed for vitamins. The sicklefin lemon shark is highly susceptible to local overfishing, {{due to its}} slow reproductive rate and limited movements. Off Southeast Asia, this shark has become scarce {{under the pressure of}} expanding, unmonitored, and unregulated fisheries, and has been assessed there as Endangered by the IUCN. Widespread habitat degradation, including pollution and <b>blast</b> <b>fishing</b> on coral reefs and deforestation in mangroves, poses an additional threat to the survival of this species in the region. Already, the sicklefin lemon shark has been extirpated in parts of India and Thailand, and has not been reported from Indonesian markets in recent years despite being historically abundant there. Off Australia, the sicklefin lemon shark is taken in only small numbers intentionally and as bycatch, and has been listed under Least Concern.|$|E

Farm production reached a high of 146, 500 mt of dried seaweeds in 1997 from an initial harvest of 500 mt in 1973. In 1997, the ASEAN region produced about 90 % of the world s production of carrageenophyte seaweed, providing raw materials for the US$ 35 O million world carrageenan market. Two species of carrageenophytes, Kappaphycus alvarezii (=Eucheuma cottonii) and Eucheuma denticulatum (=Eucheuma spinosum), constitute {{the base of the}} seaweed industry in the region.

40|$|From 1994 to 1998, EEPSEA {{approved}} some 65 {{research projects}} in environmental economic analysis. Of these, 38 related to "brown" environmental issues, 23 to "green" issues, and four to other issues. None pertained to coral reefs. This relative dearth of coral reef analysis is mirrored {{in the broader}} literature; only seven separate environmental economic studies have been undertaken that address policy concerns in SE Asia or nearby areas on Papua New Guineas and Australias Great Barrier Reef. This paper calls on researchers to pay greater attention to the "blue" dimension of our global environment, commencing with the coral reef ecosystems. Coral reefs in SE Asia represent about 30 % of the worlds reefs. They are currently undergoing unprecedented levels of degradation from stresses such as sedimentation, pollution, <b>blast</b> and cyanide <b>fishing,</b> and coral bleaching. Institutional weakness is pervasive {{and the proliferation of}} "paper parks" marine protected areas with no effective protection is alarming. Economic valuation of the coral reef asset, and of the damages wrought by institutional failures and various direct stresses, is thus of substantial policy interest. The paper provides a simple "benefit transfer" calculation using conventional methods, calculating a value of US$ 1. 4 trillion for SE Asias coral reefs. The flaws inherent in such an analysis, however, are discussed in some detail; they underline a greater need for original site-specific empirical studies that reflect local system complexities and local policy needs. The paper summarizes conditions in the EEPSEA maritime countries Cambodia, China (including Taiwan), Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Vietnam and outlines potential policy priorities in each of these. Environmental economic analysis can assist in addressing some of these priorities through: (i) increasing awareness of absolute and relative economic values; and, (ii) providing valuation estimates that can assist in coral reef management.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} paradox that many coastal communities {{in developing countries}} are resource rich but income poor. Another aspect of this paradox {{is the belief that}} local communities possess traditional knowledge that respects nature. This belief contrasts the fact that major tropical coastal ecosystems, namely coral reefs and mangroves, are being destroyed at rapid and increasing rates, in many cases by the people whose livelihoods depend on them. These paradoxical circumstances lead to a central question: if the sustainability of coastal resources is vital for the livelihood of local communities, why are these resources being degraded, often to the point of complete destruction? This study explores the motives and consequences of destructive methods of coastal resource utilisation and examines the potential for sustainable livelihoods based on coastal resources currently under threat from destructive use patterns. The analysis is based on a field study conducted in 2006 and 2008 in eleven sites around the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia. This area is characterised by great biodiversity, including one of the highest marine biodiversities in the Asia-Pacific region. Coral and mangrove ecosystem resource use was found to be driven by different processes and activities; hence the destructive practices impacting both ecosystems were also different. <b>Blast</b> and poison <b>fishing</b> were the most widespread destructive resource use methods found for coral reefs whereas large-scale habitat conversion was responsible for mangrove ecosystem reduction. In the field both resources were found to be under enormous anthropogenic pressures, with published data suggesting that only 5. 8 % of Indonesian coral reefs are currently in excellent condition and only 38 % of mangrove cover remaining in Sulawesi relative to that of 25 years ago. The dynamics of these coastal resources, and of their destruction, are classic examples of the ’tragedy of the commons’. Research findings further indicate that formal institutions tasked with managing these resources {{have not been able to}} promote their effective conservation. An array of competing demands and conflicting interests, coupled with inefficient institutional arrangements and under-investment, have rendered inadequate many resource management efforts, including the externally-imposed concepts, allowing destructive patterns of resource utilization to persist. Local communities are disempowered when confronted with (1) the intricate network of destructive-fishing actors targeting coral reefs, or (2) large company-government bureaucracy collusions allowing mangrove conversion. The existence of this collusive network must be considered in any effort to address problems of effective management. Empirical insights suggest that conservation at local level has to face the challenges of market-driven resource extraction at a global scale. Only when a coastal community manages to overcome the dilemma in managing common-pool resource, conservation measures can be implemented and a degree of sustainability attained. Findings from this research have important implications for the discourses on coastal resource policy and research. This research advances the discussions to the area where the core of conflict of interests among stakeholders took place, and yet has rarely been addressed previously. The synthesis from this study provides a strong basis to understand the nature of asymmetric relations amongst the resource stakeholders, and therefore will help in generating effective policies for a fairer coastal resource management regime...|$|R

40|$|How {{did those}} of us in the {{transportation}} industry suddenly find ourselves in need of knowing about underwater pressure waves and fish barotrauma? On October 17, 1989, a portion of the East Span of the San Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge collapsed. That event was the catalyst for the State of California to institute a comprehensive seismic retrofit program for its bridge structures. The bridge is considered a “vital lifeline structure” to San Francisco. Therefore, the bridge was to be designed to withstand the maximum expected credible quake with a design-life of 150 years. The criticality of the structure, the design life, and the soil conditions in San Francisco Bay precipitated the need for an innovative foundation design that was the nexus to use steel piles as the preferred structural support material. Ultimately, there was no structural alternative. When we began driving the steel piles, we realized that underwater pressure waves were being generated that caused stunning and even death to fish near the pile. Pressure waves are generated when the hammer strikes the pile, imparting a flexural wave that moves down the pile at approximately 5000 feet per second. As the wave does this, it interacts with the air, creating a localized pressure perturbance, resulting in airborne noise. It then moves through the water column creating compressional waves. This results in what we refer to as a hydroacoustic pulse. Finally, the energy moves down into the more-resistant substrate, where it is dissipated through the physical displacement of soil particles. A wave travels down, then back up, and it continues to reverberate until all of the energy has been dissipated, into the air, water, and soil. Our efforts to develop a better understanding of the acoustic properties of pile driving and its effects on fish began with examining the findings from past research for their relevance and applicability while looking at a variety of wave forms. The U. S. Army Corp of Engineers, Canada’s Department of Fisheries, the US Navy, and others have done many studies on the effects of explosive <b>blasts</b> on <b>fish.</b> There is a relatively small, but high-quality, body of literature that exists for effects of long-term continuous noise exposure on fish, such as that found in active sonar arrays. There is almost no information on pile driving impacts. We have also been designing and testing various noise-attenuation technologies. The bubble-tree attenuation device used to surround piles being driven for the Benicia-Martinez Bridge Project successfully reduced peak noise levels to an approximate 20 m radius around the pile. This equated to a 99. 8 % reduction in radiated energy compared to an unattenuated pile. What are some of the lessons we have learned so far? First, one needs to understand the ramifications of permit terms and conditions for these types of projects. These have to be meaningful and measurable criteria. They need to be biologically relevant and technologically possible conditions. For instance, underwater noise-monitoring equipment needs to be able to measure the target frequencies committed to within the permit. Second, one needs to develop and follow monitoring protocols with specific objectives and study controls. In other words, don’t go out and collect a bunch of data and then try and make something of it. Third, one needs to obtain incidental take authorization to avoid unanticipated work stoppages. Last and most important, avoid jeopardy and avoid and minimize the incidental effect of take to the extent practicable. What else have we learned? This is a highly complex issue, and we need to be very careful to ensure we base decisions on credible and relevant information. Just because it is in print does not mean it is useful, credible, or relevant. As the Endangered Species Act (ESA) clearly states: “The best available information is to be used in the implementation of the ESA and this information must be reliable, credible, and represent the best scientific and commercial data available. ” We soon realized other states and industries were struggling similarly with this issue and that by working together we could be more effective in our efforts. Therefore, two years ago we formed the Fisheries and Hydroacoustic Working Group. The three key goals of the Fisheries and Hydroacoustic Working Group are to summarize: 1) what we currently know (what is the best available science); 2) what we need to know (define future research needs); and, 3) what is the best application of current information for consistent interim standards. As new information is developed, the cycle repeats itself, and we will continue to update our summary of current understanding, re-evaluate further research needs, and re-evaluate and possibly modify noise-criteria standards based on what we have learned. In support of this effort, Caltrans funded preparation of the report titled “Effects of Sound on Fish” by Mardi C. Hastings, Ph. D., and Arthur N. Popper, Ph. D., that was completed in January 2005. The final report constitutes a comprehensive literature review and analysis of relevant research, recommendations for preliminary guidance, areas of uncertainty, and recommended research. On the Road to Stewardship 25 Acoustics Ecology Caltrans also submitted a proposal to the Transportation Research Board, National Cooperative Highway Research Program to fund a national research study to evaluate hydroacoustic impacts on fish from pile installations. That proposal was accepted and is underway. It is Project 25 - 28, Hydroacoustic Impacts on Fish from Pile Installation. The Federal Highway Administration has also sponsored a pooled-fund project titled “Structural Acoustic Analysis of Piles. ” The study’s goals are to develop and validate models of sound fields and the effects of attenuation systems, to develop and validate acoustical source models of pile driving, to synthesize information from this project with other pertinent research, and to develop a guidance document for practitioners. The three most recent efforts that Caltrans has underway are: 1) the development of an Interim Guidance Manual that identifies procedures for assessing and mitigating effects of pile driving sound on fish; 2) the development of an underwater sound-pressure compendium; and, 3) development of a methodology for measuring and reporting underwater sound pressure...|$|R
