40|$|Labour market {{flexibility}} {{is an issue}} that has been much debated but remains controversial. It is argued in this thesis that the lack of theoretical and empirical clarity which has impeded the study of flexibility has resulted from two main deficiencies. The first is that although the public sector has been identified as a major site of flexible forms of labour, the systematic study of this phenomenon has been largely absent. The second is that flexibility as a concept has obscured forms of employment relations that are distinct. One aim of this thesis was therefore to refocus the theoretical debates by drawing together a number of literatures that have so far remained discrete. This analysis provided the basis for a clearer empirical study by identifying the relationship between restructuring public sector employment, specifically in social services and schools, and one aspect of labour market flexibility: temporary labour. A review of previous research indicated that temporary work is likely to affect women, minority ethnic groups and young workers {{to a greater extent than}} the wider population. The literature also highlighted the statistical and managerial bias in the debates and in doing so indicated the need for new perspectives and methods to be adopted to further an understanding of issues that surround flexibility. The research for this thesis therefore examined temporary labour in the public sector from the perspective of employers, workers and trade unions in two case study local authorities and LEAs using qualitative methods. By adopting this approach the research data indicated that employers' conflicting motivations to use temporary labour are exacerbated <b>by</b> <b>decentralised</b> <b>management</b> functions. Personalised and arbitrary management associated with devolved powers highlighted a number of characteristics associated with temporary employment contracts. The central feature was the enhanced power imbalance in favour of employers created by the insecurity inherent in this form of employment, which resulted in forms of control that were gendered and racialised. The experience of temporary workers reflected these findings and emphasised the vulnerability of their situation. The trade union position on temporary work was however ambivalent, displaying a combination of responses even within branches of the same union, raising serious questions for trade union democracy...|$|E

40|$|What {{explains}} Germany’s superb export performance? Is Germany’s export behaviour very distinct {{compared to}} other European countries? The authors explore the organisational responses to competition of 14, 000 exporting firms in seven European countries. The paper examines the export business model of the median exporter and of the top one percent exporters in each country, accounting for 20 percent to 55 percent of total exports. What do these firms do to become superstars? The authors find, first, that the export market share of the median exporter {{in each of the}} countries to the world more than tripled (in some cases the export market share increases tenfold) for firms that combine <b>decentralised</b> <b>management</b> with offshoring of production to low-wage countries. Exporters which abstain from any organisational adjustment do very badly. <b>Decentralised</b> <b>management</b> provides incentives for workers for product improvements allowing exporters to compete on quality. Offshoring production to low-wage countries reduces costs allowing exporters to compete on price. Second, we find that Germany is the leading quality exporter in Europe followed by Austria and Spain. Among the top 10 percent of exporters there is no single firm with low quality in Germany and Austria, which suggest that <b>decentralised</b> <b>management</b> has provided incentives for quality in these countries. Third, Germany’s exports are less vulnerable to price increases, while exports from France and Italy respond strongly to price changes, and thus costs reductions via offshoring benefits these countries most...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{advantages and disadvantages}} with internal markets and different degrees of internal trading of services and supplies in the Norwegian Armed Forces. Different degrees of internal trading in armed forces relate mainly to the grade of internal pricing and centralised versus <b>decentralised</b> <b>management</b> of internal trading. The policy of internal pricing is common, but the level of management of internal markets varies between military capabilities and services. Overall, the support side, consisting of the Norwegian Defence Logistic Organisation and Norwegian Defence Estates Agency, seem to have advantages with this model, independent from degree of internal trading. On the other side, the operational side seems generally to have disadvantages with the internal markets. Furthermore, significant disadvantages were discovered for the units that have <b>decentralised</b> <b>management.</b> Additionally the organisation model derived {{by the process of}} creating internal markets seems to have some negative effects on the efficiency of the operational capabilities. The recommendation is to compensate the internal markets with more vertical management and less internal pricing. In addition, a restrictive policy of decentralised organisation of the internal markets seems to mitigate the negative effects...|$|R

40|$|By {{the end of}} {{the last}} century many {{countries}} including Tanzania moved from centralised towards <b>decentralised</b> forest <b>management</b> but little empirical evidence exists on how such changes have influenced forest conditions. The objective of this study was to provide insights on how decentralised approaches might influence forest resource conditions. Forest cover analyses from satellite images (1993, 2000 and 2009) and systematic sample plot inventories (2009) in two state forest reserves under joint forest management (JFM) and two village forest reserves under community-based forest management (CBFM) in Babati District, Tanzania were carried out. Based on the results, it was not possible to claim that the <b>decentralised</b> <b>management</b> had been successful in improving forest conditions. Proportions of closed woodland decreased significantly over time (from over 80 to 50 – 60 % under JFM and from around 70 to almost 0 % under CBFM. In all forests, numbers of regenerants were high, but proportions of larger trees were low and levels of removals (legal and illegal) were relatively high. In general the situation under JFM was better than under CBFM. Results of this study can be used by policymakers to assess the influence of <b>decentralised</b> forest <b>management</b> in Tanzania. The study was done as a part of the project 'Assessing the impact of forestland tenure changes on forest resources and rural livelihoods in Tanzania' (No. NUFUTZ- 2007 / 10226) under the Tanzania–Norway NUFU Programme 2007 – 2012.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} Cameroon’s {{model of}} forest-management decentralisation by characterising its organisational infrastructure and by assessing – and anticipating – the ecological effects of those policy changes. The essay {{is based on}} nvironmental governance research conducted in Cameroon {{during the last three}} years. Five Community Forests, one Council Forest and nine forestry fee management committees were covered by the study. Methods of data collection included participant observation, analysis of historical trends, semi-structured interviews at the regional level, focus group meetings, historical transects of landscape and future scenarios. The first section describes the key reforms put in place by the new forest management regime, including the institutional and socio-organisational choices legally prescribed for outlying actors in the <b>decentralised</b> <b>management</b> of forests and their revenues. The mechanisms connecting these institutional and socio-organisational choices to implementation – that is, the management of Community Forests, Council Forests and forestry revenues – are examined {{in the second part of}} the essay. The third section assesses the social outcomes of these processes. Ecological risks and uncertainties due to the way <b>decentralised</b> <b>management</b> is conducted at both the local and the regional levels are addressed in the fourth section. The Cameroonian decentralisation model, already registered some positive infra-outcomes. After all, decentralisation is not mechanical. It is not only explainable by laws and institutional arrangements: its implementation depends on many variables. It requires sufficient time to develop due to the complexity of human and institutional behaviour and because of unpredictability, variability, contingency and change, as well as many other stimuli. In sum, it is a ‘story’ of adaptation, with successes and failures. Policy innovations and reforms are in themselves experiments and should not be perceived as victories or crises, but, instead, as arenas of ongoing lessons and progressive learning...|$|R
