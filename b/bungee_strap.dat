50|$|Cylinder straps: Sidemount {{cylinders}} are {{secured to}} the diver's butt-plate or rear harness D-rings via a cam-band or worm clamp {{to which a}} bolt-snap is attached via cord. The placement of the cam-band/worm clamp along the cylinder length is determined by characteristics needed to ensure cylinder trim {{in line with the}} diver's torso. The upper cylinder may be secured directly via the <b>bungee</b> <b>strap,</b> or by using a choker into a ring-bungee configuration.|$|E

25|$|The choreography {{incorporates}} {{several types}} of acrobatics and martial arts, including fight scenes using the Wushu style of martial arts, Chinese opera, Poi for manipulating staves and batons, Brazilian Capoeira dance, <b>bungees,</b> aerial <b>straps,</b> swing poles, and a wheel of death.|$|R
2500|$|Underwater slates {{are useful}} {{when there is}} more {{detailed}} information to communicate or remember. [...] A large variety of designs are available – some that clip to the divers BCD, some that fit into pockets, some integrated with other units such as the compass and some which are held on the wrist or forearm by <b>bungee</b> <b>straps.</b> [...] The basic parts comprise just an underwater pencil attached to a plastic board by a short tether to prevent accidental loss, {{and a way to}} attach them to a convenient point on the diver's equipment. [...] Slates are particularly useful if information needs to be written down prior to a dive and referenced during a dive – elements of the dive plan (depths, durations, decompression schedule) or a drawn map of the area to be dived.|$|R
50|$|Rear Basket system: This {{method has}} been around for a while and allows the user to attach a tray to the back of their PWC on the landing ramp. The basket is held on by <b>bungee</b> clamps, <b>straps</b> and clips. This basket allows the {{attachment}} of steel tubes for rods and the basket allows a cooler to be installed onto the back of the machine. The basket and cooler can be an obstacle when re-boarding the jet ski.|$|R
50|$|Open heel fins are {{secured to}} the foot by a strap which passes {{around the back of}} the ankle. These are usually elastic and may be adjustable. Early fins used rubber straps {{connected}} to the fin by a wire buckle, and were not readily adjustable. Later versions incorporated swivels, buckles, quick release connectors and adjustable tension, but the increased complexity and decreased reliability, and tendency of the loose strap ends to hook on things triggered a return by some manufacturers and aftermarket accessory manufacturers to simpler systems. These include stainless steel spring <b>straps</b> and <b>bungee</b> <b>straps,</b> which once set up, are not adjustable, and which reduce the number of potential failure points and places where the fin can snag on obstructions like net, line and seaweed. Some heel straps have a loop for better grip with wet hands or gloves.Some fins designed for surf use have integral straps which can neither be replaced nor adjusted, but are simple and have no projections which can snag or scratch the swimmer's legs. They are much like full foot pocket fins without the back part of the sole, but do not trap as much sand when used in the surf.|$|R
25|$|To prevent some {{of these}} adverse {{physiological}} effects, the station is equipped with two treadmills (including the COLBERT), and the aRED (advanced Resistive Exercise Device) which enables various weightlifting exercises which add muscle but do not compensate for or raise astronauts' reduced bone density, and a stationary bicycle; each astronaut spends {{at least two hours}} per day exercising on the equipment. Astronauts use <b>bungee</b> cords to <b>strap</b> themselves to the treadmill.|$|R
5000|$|In 2001 Brett Hemphill {{designed}} the Armadillo Side-Mount Harness. The Armadillo innovated several features {{that would be}} utilized in many future side-mount harness designs Butt anchoring rear attachment pad, Cylinder bungee attachment located under the wing, cylinder <b>bungee</b> location <b>straps</b> for quick location of bungees and primary BCD inflation located {{at the bottom of}} the harness instead of the top. Widespread popularity of sidemount diving systems did not truly emerge until the mid-2010s, when the growing popularity of technical and cave diving became exposed to sidemount proponents on the internet who were offering an alternative approach that matched the minimalism and functionality of the popular 'DIR/Hogarthian' back-mounted systems, whilst offering advantages in flexibility, comfort, accessibility and - highly debated online - safety.|$|R
500|$|To prevent some {{of these}} effects, the station was {{equipped}} with two treadmills (in the core module and Kvant-2) and a stationary bicycle (in the core module); each cosmonaut was to cycle the equivalent of [...] and run the equivalent of [...] per day. Cosmonauts used <b>bungee</b> cords to <b>strap</b> themselves to the treadmill. Researchers believe that exercise is a good countermeasure for the bone and muscle density loss that occurs in low-gravity situations.|$|R
50|$|The treadmills are {{intended}} to help astronauts stay fit, fighting off the bone loss (spaceflight osteopenia) and muscle decay that otherwise comes with space travel. Astronauts use <b>bungee</b> cords to <b>strap</b> themselves to the treadmill {{in order to remain}} in contact with the equipment while in micro-gravity. Researchers believe that exercise is a good countermeasure for the bone and muscle density loss that occurs when humans live for a long time without gravity.|$|R
50|$|To prevent some {{of these}} effects, the station was {{equipped}} with two treadmills (in the core module and Kvant-2) and a stationary bicycle (in the core module); each cosmonaut was to cycle the equivalent of 10 km and run the equivalent of 5 km per day. Cosmonauts used <b>bungee</b> cords to <b>strap</b> themselves to the treadmill. Researchers believe that exercise is a good countermeasure for the bone and muscle density loss that occurs in low-gravity situations.|$|R
25|$|To prevent some {{of these}} adverse {{physiological}} effects, the ISS is equipped with two treadmills (including the COLBERT), and the aRED (advanced Resistive Exercise Device), which enable various weight-lifting exercises which add muscle but do nothing for bone density, and a stationary bicycle; each astronaut spends {{at least two hours}} per day exercising on the equipment. Astronauts use <b>bungee</b> cords to <b>strap</b> themselves to the treadmill. Astronauts subject to long periods of weightlessness wear pants with elastic bands attached between waistband and cuffs to compress the leg bones and reduce osteopenia.|$|R
