40|$|Introduction. In {{the last}} 10 - 15 years a {{dominant}} {{position in the}} market of medium voltage circuit breakers, vacuum circuit breakers have taken in which as an actuator mono- or bistable actuators with permanent magnets are used. Such circuit breakers are characterized by simplicity of design, high reliability, require preventive maintenance for many years. Development, research and improvement of vacuum circuit breakers are carried out at the Department for Electrical Apparatus, National Technical University «Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute». While working on the circuit breakers, developers {{have to deal with}} two related objectives – electrical and mechanical. This paper considers the solution of one of these problems – calculation of mechanical forces in the drive shaft of the vacuum circuit breaker in static and dynamic modes. This work was preceded by the failure of the results of measurements of the prototype circuit breakers’ contacts. Measurements have shown that these values do not match the expected values (there were less than the value of 0. 8 to 1 mm). The assumption about the reasons for this discrepancy needed to be detailed checked. The results of the work done are presented in this paper. Purpose. Investigation of static and dynamic mechanical stresses and strains in the drive shaft of the vacuum circuit <b>breaker</b> <b>mechanism</b> to determine its characteristics and material selection. Methods. The investigation of mechanical processes is performed by the finite element method in the COMSOL software package. Results. We obtain the static and dynamic characteristics of the circuit breaker drive shaft: deformations, reaction forces, stresses. These characteristics made it possible to determine the actual course of the contacts, select shaft material and calculate the forces acting on the bearings. Conclusions. It is shown that the contact velocity and contact pressure are different from the theoretical value due to the deformation of the shaft. The forces acting on the thrust bearings dynamically are by 16 - 39 % higher than the static ones. It is assumed that further refinement of the mathematical model takes into account the traction insulators and housing, as well as dynamics of the circuit breaker...|$|E
40|$|A vacuum {{interrupter}} is a switching device used in vacuum circuit breakers, which are widely employed in medium voltage circuits for interrupting the short-circuit fault currents. The {{vacuum interrupter}} is the chamber {{in which the}} arc extinction and hence the current interruption takes place. On the occurrence of a fault, the <b>breaker</b> <b>mechanism</b> separates the contacts of the vacuum interrupter. As the contacts separate, an arc is established between the contacts. The arc evolves in the contact space and extinguishes {{at or near the}} current zero, thus interrupting the current. The processes of arc ignition, evolution and extinction are very complex. These processes are fundamental to the design and the performance of the vacuum interrupter and hence the circuit breaker. The evolution of the arc predominantly depends on the short-circuit current, the design and metallurgy of the contacts. The evolution of the vacuum arc has been the focal point of considerable research activity. Significant effort has been concentrated to understand the various modes of the arc, the transition between the modes, the arc movement and the dependency on the contact design and finally the effect of the arc evolution on the current interruption performance of the vacuum interrupter. The voltage across the contacts during the arcing, termed as the arc voltage, has been a focal point of several research projects. Research has shown that the arc voltage depends strongly on the mode and the evolution process of the arc. The dependency is observed with respect to the magnitude {{and the nature of the}} arc voltage. This dependency has been established through the comparison of the arc voltage trace and the actual arc photographs. The arc voltage is thus an important parameter in understanding the arcing process in the interrupter. Arc voltage could also be utilised to compare the arcing behaviour in vacuum interrupters with different contact geometries and metallurgies. Having understood how the arc voltage depends on the arc modes and how it can be used to analyse the arcing performance of the interrupter, this work aims to establish experimentally the dependency of the arc voltage on fundamental parameters of the short-circuit current and the contact design. The variation of the arc voltage is studied with respect to the magnitude of the short-circuit current. It is seen that the magnitude of the arc voltage is higher, for a higher short-circuit current. This dependency is also reflected in the nature of the arc voltage waveform. The effect of cumulative short- circuit operations has been understood through the study of arc voltage variation with respect to the accumulated arcing time. It has been found that the arc voltage consistently decreases as the accumulated arcing time increases. The effect of the contact diameter on the arc evolution has been studied by comparing the arc voltage variations for contacts of different diameters for the same short-circuit current. It is observed that the variation of arc voltage with respect to the contact diameter depends on the type of contact. In the case of radial magnetic field contacts, it has been observed that the arc voltage is lower for a contact with lower diameter. Whereas in the case of axial magnetic field contacts there is an inverse relation between the contact diameter and the arc voltage. Finally, the effect of the type and distribution of the magnetic field on the arc voltage variation as well as the contact erosion has been studied. In general, the observations show that the arc voltage magnitude for the radial magnetic field geometry is higher than the axial magnetic field geometry. Also, there is a significant difference in the appearance of the arc voltage waveforms for the arcs under the two types of magnetic fields. Finite element simulations and short-circuit evaluations have shown that the axial magnetic field contact system with 90 deg coil orientations yield a more uniform distribution of the flux density and hence lower erosion of the contacts. These results show a clear dependence of the arc voltage on the various above mentioned parameters. Thus the arc voltage could be utilised as a diagnostic parameter during the evaluation of the vacuum interrupter. In the present scenario, significant research is being done to increase the breaking capacity of the interrupters. This calls for optimization of design of the existing contacts and the design of novel contact geometries. The arc voltage would be used as an important diagnostic tool in this process. Also, the utilization of vacuum interrupter in high voltage and extra high voltage circuits is being explored. This application requires increase in the contact gap or series connection of gaps. The arc behaviour in longer gaps and gaps connected in series would be an important research area. Again the arc voltage could be used to study the arc evolution in these specialised conditions. The experiments in this research work have been performed on commercial vacuum interrupters. For a dedicated research on vacuum arcs and vacuum interrupter contacts, development of a vacuum arc research facility has also been attempted as a part of this research work...|$|E
40|$|A {{circuit breaker}} {{is widely used}} to protect {{electric}} power system from fault currents or system errors; in particular, the opening mechanism in a circuit breaker is important to protect current overflow in the electric system. In this paper, multibody dynamic model of a circuit <b>breaker</b> including switch <b>mechanism</b> was developed including the electromagnetic actuator system. Since the opening mechanism operates sequentially, optimization of the switch mechanism was carried out to improve the current breaking time. In the optimization process, design parameters were selected from length and shape of each latch, which changes pivot points of bearings to shorten the breaking time. To validate optimization results, computational results were compared to physical tests with a high speed camera. Opening time of the optimized mechanism was decreased by 2. 3 [*]ms, which was proved by experiments. Switch mechanism design process can be improved including contact-latch system by using this process...|$|R
40|$|When water waves {{break on}} a beach, in deep water, {{or under the}} bow of a ship, and in many {{industrial}} and environmental processes where strong mixing is sought or develops, there is turbulence that causes the free surface to be strongly deformed or to break up. Such turbulence is often generated at the free surface, as in a <b>breaker,</b> by <b>mechanisms</b> {{that have yet to}} be fully identified. The aim of this proposal is to support a research student to study one particular aspect of such flows in conjunction with a team already working on the TAFS project, i. e. an EPSRC funded project on strong Turbulence At a Free Surface being a collaborative project with both Bristol and Southampton Universities. The foundation for the TAFS project is set out in two papers: BP 1 and BP 2 (Brocchini & Peregrine 2001 a, b). In the TAFS project we have determined that we need to consider some “standard ” flows. That is, as for turbulence in a homogeneous fluid where certain standard flows have been studied in depth: such as boundary layers, mixing layers, etc. For the free-surface case the most obvious such flow is the hydraulic jump, and we also intend to look at flows caused by submerged and impacting jets. A further less wellknown example is the flow at a scar. We consider that investigation of scars forms a well prescribed topic within the overall project where a research student can get good training in research and make a worthwhile contribution, hence this grant proposal...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, {{soldiers}} positioned at Tacoma's military bases provided {{the foundation for}} a growing hip-hop fan base in the Northwest. This increased demand for hip-hop coincided with some of the first hip-hop dances in Seattle, which were held at public-housing recreation centers and featured the Emerald Street Boys and Anthony [...] "Sir Mix-A-Lot" [...] Ray. Simultaneously, [...] "Nasty Nes" [...] Rodriguez launched the Northwest's first all-rap radio program, Fresh Tracks, and soon Nasty Nes began airing self-produced tracks by Sir Mix-A-Lot, as well as the Emerald Street Boys, MC LeRap, PDQ, and Andy Hamlin. Fresh Tracks was a 30-minute show that played on Sunday nights on KKFX 1250 ("KFOX" [...] and formerly KKDZ), and consisted of a mix of new songs and a mastermix created by Nasty Nes (Stranger article). These mixes were made up of songs by The World's Famous Supreme Team, Malcolm McLaren, Run-D.M.C. and others (Stranger article). Due to the show's popularity, the station's producer allowed Nes to expand it to a Monday through Friday, 9pm to midnight show called NightBeat that featured prominent R&B songs as well as intermixed rap songs (Stranger article). As Seattle's music scene evolved, so did the Seattle breakdance and graffiti crews, including B-Boy groups like Silver Chain Gang, Circuit <b>Breakers,</b> and Breaking <b>Mechanism,</b> and graffiti writers such as Spaide, DadOne, and Spraycan. At this time the Northwest was considered an empty canvas, which lagged behind other regions in creating a unique identity that was associated with hip hop. With this space there was room for an eclectic group of identities to form, however none were successful in formulating a Seattle identity.|$|R
40|$|Wave {{breaking}} is {{an important}} coastal process, influencing hydro-morphodynamic processes such as turbulence generation and wave energy dissipation, run-up {{on the beach and}} overtopping of coastal defence structures. During breaking, waves are complex mixtures of air and water (“white water”) whose properties affect velocity and pressure fields {{in the vicinity of the}} free surface and, depending on the <b>breaker</b> characteristics, different <b>mechanisms</b> for air entrainment are usually observed. Several laboratory experiments have been performed to investigate the role of air bubbles in the wave breaking process (Chanson & Cummings, 1994, among others) and in wave loading on vertical wall (Oumeraci et al., 2001; Peregrine et al., 2006, among others), showing that the air phase is not negligible since the turbulent energy dissipation involves air-water mixture. The recent advancement of numerical models has given valuable insights in the knowledge of wave transformation and interaction with coastal structures. Among these models, some solve the RANS equations coupled with a free-surface tracking algorithm and describe velocity, pressure, turbulence and vorticity fields (Lara et al. 2006 a-b, Clementi et al., 2007). The single-phase numerical model, in which the constitutive equations are solved only for the liquid phase, neglects effects induced by air movement and trapped air bubbles in water. Numerical approximations at the free surface may induce errors in predicting breaking point and wave height and moreover, entrapped air bubbles and water splash in air are not properly represented. The aim of the present thesis is to develop a new two-phase model called COBRAS 2 (stands for Cornell Breaking waves And Structures 2 phases), that is the enhancement of the single-phase code COBRAS 0, originally developed at Cornell University (Lin & Liu, 1998). In the first part of the work, both fluids are considered as incompressible, while the second part will treat air compressibility modelling. The mathematical formulation and the numerical resolution of the governing equations of COBRAS 2 are derived and some model-experiment comparisons are shown. In particular, validation tests are performed in order to prove model stability and accuracy. The simulation of the rising of a large air bubble in an otherwise quiescent water pool reveals the model capability to reproduce the process physics in a realistic way. Analytical solutions for stationary and internal waves are compared with corresponding numerical results, in order to test processes involving wide range of density difference. Waves induced by dam-break in different scenarios (on dry and wet beds, as well as on a ramp) are studied, focusing on the role of air as the medium in which the water wave propagates and on the numerical representation of bubble dynamics. Simulations of solitary and regular waves, characterized by both spilling and plunging breakers, are analyzed with comparisons with experimental data and other numerical model in order to investigate air influence on wave breaking mechanisms and underline model capability and accuracy. Finally, modelling of air compressibility is included in the new developed model and is validated, revealing an accurate reproduction of processes. Some preliminary tests on wave impact on vertical walls are performed: since air flow modelling allows to have a more realistic reproduction of breaking wave propagation, the dependence of wave breaker shapes and aeration characteristics on impact pressure values is studied and, on the basis of a qualitative comparison with experimental observations, the numerical simulations achieve good results. ...|$|R
