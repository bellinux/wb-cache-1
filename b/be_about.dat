5|$|Although {{thallium}} is a modestly abundant {{element in}} the Earth's crust, with a concentration estimated to <b>be</b> <b>about</b> 0.7mg/kg, mostly in association with potassium-based minerals in clays, soils, and granites, thallium is not generally economically recoverable from these sources. The major source of thallium for practical purposes is the trace amount that is found in copper, lead, zinc, and other heavy-metal-sulfide ores.|$|E

5|$|Comet Hale–Bopp's {{activity}} and outgassing were not spread uniformly over its nucleus, but instead came from several specific jets.

5|$|MU5 was {{designed}} to <b>be</b> <b>about</b> 20 times faster than Atlas, and was optimised for running compiled programs rather than hand-written machine code, something that contemporary computers were unable to do efficiently. A {{major factor in the}} MU5's much-improved performance over its predecessors was its incorporation of associative memory, which greatly speeded up access to its main store.|$|E
