40|$|Breeders {{of sugar}} beet (Beta vulgaris L.) {{use a variety}} of {{conventional}} <b>breeding</b> <b>methods</b> and novel techniques striving to protect, maintain and expand the genetic variability of the crop, develop superior hybrids, and multiply their seed. In recent years, a new methodology of genetic transformations has been extensively used in sugar beet breeding. The new methodology is used with the intention of introducing desirable genes, those that cannot be introduced by the classical <b>breeding</b> <b>methods</b> or which take a lengthy process to be introduced due to genetic barriers occur­ring during crossing. Conventional <b>breeding</b> <b>methods</b> and genetic engineering methods have been used to improve the sugar beet genome by the introduction of genes for resistance to Cercospora, rhizomania and nematodes. Presently, genes that modify the carbohydrate metabolism and genes that confer resistance to the active substances in certain herbicides may be introduced only by means of genetic engineering methods. ...|$|R
50|$|Very {{little is}} known about the Cordillera ground warblers <b>breeding</b> <b>method.</b> The nest are mostly found on rock cliffs, made up of wet sticks, branches, and leaves.

50|$|However, {{there are}} {{disadvantages}} to this process. Because a single experiment done in selective breeding {{cannot be used}} to assess an entire group of genetic variances, individual experiments must be done for every individual trait. Also, because {{of the necessity of}} selective breeding experiments to require maintaining the organisms tested in a lab or greenhouse, it is impractical to use this <b>breeding</b> <b>method</b> on many organisms. Controlled mating instances are difficult to carry out in this case and this is a necessary component of selective breeding.|$|E
50|$|If two {{compatible}} {{animals are}} found at different zoos, the animals may be transported for mating, {{but this is}} stressful, which could in turn make mating less likely.

Artificial fertilization (by shipping semen) is another option, but male animals can experience stress during semen collection, and the same goes for females during the artificial insemination procedure. Furthermore, this approach yields lower-quality semen because shipping requires the life of the sperm to be extended for the transit times.|$|E

Soybean breeders {{have been successful in}} producing a large number of varieties using conventional <b>breeding</b> <b>methods,</b> the Single Seed Descent method in particular. In recent decades, with the increased use of genetic transformations, backcrossing is more frequent though the only trait that has been commercialized is glyphosate tolerance. Physiological breeding poses a particular challenge, as well as phenotyping and development of useful criteria and techniques suitable for plant breeding. Using modern remote sensing techniques provides great opportunity for collecting a large amount of physiological data in real environment, which is necessary for physiological breeding.

40|$|The <b>breeding</b> <b>method</b> {{has been}} {{implemented}} in the NASA Seasonal-to-Interannual Prediction Project (NSIPP) Coupled General Circulation Model (CGCM) {{with the goal of}} improving operational seasonal to interannual climate predictions through ensemble forecasting and data assimilation. The coupled instability as cap'tured by the <b>breeding</b> <b>method</b> is the first attempt to isolate the evolving ENSO instability and its corresponding global atmospheric response in a fully coupled ocean-atmosphere GCM. Our results show that the growth rate of the coupled bred vectors (BV) peaks at about 3 months before a background ENSO event. The dominant growing BV modes are reminiscent of the background ENSO anomalies and show a strong tropical response with wind/SST/thermocline interrelated {{in a manner similar to}} the background ENSO mode. They exhibit larger amplitudes in the eastern tropical Pacific, reflecting the natural dynamical sensitivity associated with the presence of the shallow thermocline. Moreover, the extratropical perturbations associated with these coupled BV modes reveal the variations related to the atmospheric teleconnection patterns associated with background ENSO variability, e. g. over the North Pacific and North America. A similar experiment was carried out with the NCEP/CFS 03 CGCM. Comparisons between bred vectors from the NSIPP CGCM and NCEP/CFS 03 CGCM demonstrate the robustness of the results. Our results strongly suggest that the <b>breeding</b> <b>method</b> can serve as a natural filter to identify the slowly varying, coupled instabilities in a coupled GCM, which can be used to construct ensemble perturbations for ensemble forecasts and to estimate the coupled background error covariance for coupled data assimilation...|$|E

One hundredand fifty randomly taken F 2 plants originated the segregating populations, which were conducted until the fifth generation bythe following breeding procedures: Single Seed Descent (SSD), Bulk and Bulk within F 2. The total grain protein content of theF 5 families was then analyzed. It was concluded that there was enough genetic variability in the cross under study.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the <b>breeding</b> <b>method</b> in determining growth and decay characteristics of certain solutions to the Kortweg-de Vries (KdV) equation and the Nonlinear Schrödinger equation is investigated. Bred vectors are a finite amplitude, finite time generalization of Leading Lyapunov Vectors (LLV), and breeding {{has been used to}} predict large impending fluctuations in many systems, including chaotic systems. Here, the focus is on predicting fluctuations associated with extreme waves. The bred vector analysis is applied to the KdV equation with two types of initial conditions: soliton collisions, and a Gaussian distribution which decays into a group of solitons. The soliton solutions are stable, and the breeding analysis enables tracking of the growth and decay during the interactions. Furthermore, this study with a known stable system helps validate the use of <b>breeding</b> <b>method</b> for waves. This analysis is also applied to characterize rogue wave type solutions of the NLSE, which have been used to describe extreme ocean waves. In the results obtained, the growth rate maxima and the peaks of the bred vector always precede the rogue wave peaks.
