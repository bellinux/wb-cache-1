5|$|Philosophy of {{perception}} {{is concerned with}} the nature of perceptual experience and the status of perceptual objects, in particular how perceptual experience relates to appearances and <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> world.

He {{documented}} Roman <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> onion's ability to improve vision ailments, aid in sleep, and heal everything from mouth sores and toothaches, to dog bites, lumbago and even dysentery. Archaeologists unearthing Pompeii long after it was buried in a volcanic explosion found gardens of Pliny's detailed narratives, where onions had grown.|$|E
40|$|This {{chapter is}} {{organized}} around four central questions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> role of reasons in the epistemology of perception.

The 'how?' question: how does perception provide us with reasons for <b>belief</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> external world? The 'when?' question: when does perception provide us with reasons for <b>belief</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> external world? The 'what?' question: what are the reasons that perception provides us with for <b>belief</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> external world...|$|R

The data are from Len Frobisher, who conducted a pair of surveys of English schoolchildren. Frobisher was interested in how knowledge of single-digit parity translates to knowledge of multiple-digit parity, and zero figures prominently in the results.|$|E
5|$|Archaeoastronomy uses {{a variety}} of methods to uncover {{evidence}} of past practices including archaeology, anthropology, astronomy, statistics and probability, and history. Because these methods are diverse and use data from such different sources, integrating them into a coherent argument has been a long-term difficulty for archaeoastronomers. Archaeoastronomy fills complementary niches in landscape archaeology and cognitive archaeology. Material evidence and its connection to the sky can reveal how a wider landscape can be integrated into <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> cycles of nature, such as Mayan astronomy and its relationship with agriculture. Other examples which have brought together ideas of cognition and landscape include studies of the cosmic order embedded in the roads of settlements.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{knowledge}} of Egyptian <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> gods is mostly drawn from religious writings {{produced by the}} nation's scribes and priests. These people were the elite of Egyptian society and were very distinct from the general populace, {{most of whom were}} illiterate. Little is known about how well this broader population knew or understood the sophisticated ideas that the elite developed. Commoners' perceptions of the divine may have differed from those of the priests. The populace may, for example, have mistaken the religion's symbolic statements about the gods and their actions for literal truth. But overall, what little is known about popular religious belief is consistent with the elite tradition. The two traditions form a largely cohesive vision of the gods and their nature.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese {{were able}} to finish landing their troops, which {{may have contributed to}} the {{impression}} of significant forces in front of the Australian defenders and their subsequent withdrawal. The heavy losses suffered by the Allied aircraft and aircrew virtually eliminated their ability to influence the subsequent ground battles. Moran's report on Japanese incompetence at night fighting was the most important result of the battle. Since few details about the subsequent night combats off Java survived, Moran's assessment influenced Allied thinking about the IJN until the stunning victory during the nighttime Battle of Savo Island in August flipped the Allied <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Japanese ability at night fighting on their heads.|$|E
5|$|The {{roles of}} each deity were fluid, and each god could expand its nature {{to take on}} new characteristics. As a result, gods' roles are {{difficult}} to categorize or define. But despite their flexibility, the gods had limited abilities and spheres of influence. Not even the creator god could reach {{beyond the boundaries of}} the cosmos that he created, and even Isis, though she was said to be the cleverest of the gods, was not omniscient. Richard H. Wilkinson, however, argues that some texts from the late New Kingdom suggest that, as <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> god Amun evolved, he was thought to approach omniscience and omnipresence and to transcend the limits of the world in a way that other deities did not.|$|E
5|$|The spells of the Book of the Dead {{made use}} of several magical {{techniques}} which {{can also be seen}} in other areas of Egyptian life. A number of spells are for magical amulets, which would protect the deceased from harm. In addition to being represented on a Book of the Dead papyrus, these spells appeared on amulets wound into the wrappings of a mummy. Everyday magic {{made use of}} amulets in huge numbers. Other items in direct contact with the body in the tomb, such as headrests, were also considered to have amuletic value. A number of spells also refer to Egyptian <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> magical healing power of saliva.|$|E

5|$|Traditional Western <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{spotted hyena}} {{can be traced}} back to Aristotle's Historia Animalium, which {{described}} the species as a necrophagous, cowardly and potentially dangerous animal. He further described how the hyena uses retching noises to attract dogs. In On the Generation of Animals, Aristotle criticised the erroneous belief that the spotted hyena is a hermaphrodite (which likely originated from the confusion caused by the masculinised genitalia of the female), though his physical descriptions are more consistent with the striped hyena. Pliny the Elder supported Aristotle's depiction, though he further elaborated that the hyena can imitate human voices. Additionally, he wrote how the hyena was held in high regard among the Magi, and that hyena body parts could cure different diseases, give protection and stimulate sexual desire in people.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{based on the premise that}} {{knowledge}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> alphas of one set of funds will influence an investor's <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> other funds. This will be true insofar as an investor's expectation <b>about</b> <b>the</b> performance of a fund is partly a <b>belief</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> abilities of mutual fund managers as a group and, more generally, a <b>belief</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> degree to which financial markets are efficient. We develop a simple framework for incorporating this prior dependence' and find that it can have a substantial impact on the cross-section of posterior <b>beliefs</b> <b>about</b> fund performance as well as asset allocation. Under independence, the maximum posterior mean alpha increases without bound as the number of funds increases and 'extremely large' estimates are randomly observed. This is true even when fund managers have no skill. In contrast, with prior dependence, investors aggregate information across funds to form a general <b>belief</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> potential for abnormal performance. Each fund's alpha estimate is shrunk toward the aggregate estimate, mitigating extreme views. An additional implication is that restricting the estimation to surviving funds, a common practice in this literature, imparts an upward bias to the average fund alpha. ...|$|R
