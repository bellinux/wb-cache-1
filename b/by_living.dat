30|$|Among female participants, {{binge eating}} scores were {{significantly}} predicted by anxiety caused <b>by</b> high-density <b>living</b> conditions (P =  0.008), and similarly, {{the frequency of}} compensatory behaviors was significantly predicted by anxiety caused <b>by</b> high-density <b>living</b> conditions (P =  0.000) and self-control (P =  0.003). Furthermore, the Internet Addiction Test scores were significantly predicted by the anxiety caused <b>by</b> high -density <b>living</b> conditions (P =  0.000) and self-control (P =  0.000). Among male participants, {{not only were the}} binge eating scores significantly predicted by the anxiety caused <b>by</b> high-density <b>living</b> conditions (P =  0.000) and self-control (P =  0.000), but the frequency of compensatory behaviors was also significantly predicted by the anxiety caused <b>by</b> high-density <b>living</b> conditions (P =  0.000) and self-control (P =  0.01). Furthermore, Internet Addiction Test scores were significantly predicted by anxiety caused <b>by</b> high-density <b>living</b> conditions (P =  0.000) and self-control (P =  0.000). It was further found that for both genders, subjective factors such as self-control, and the anxiety caused <b>by</b> high-density <b>living</b> conditions had a stronger impact on Internet addiction than objective factors, such as the size of the student’s dormitory room. Moreover, self-control was found to act as a moderator in the relationship between anxiety and Internet addiction among male participants.|$|R

5|$|There are two known {{examples}} of molecular-scale rotating structures used <b>by</b> <b>living</b> cells. ATP synthase is an enzyme {{used in the}} process of energy storage and transfer. It bears some similarity to the flagellar motors discussed below. ATP synthase is thought to have arisen by modular evolution, in which two subunits with their own functions have become associated and gained a new functionality.|$|E
5|$|A second {{option is}} to {{increase}} the amount of well-watered vegetation. These two options can be combined with the implementation of green roofs. Green roofs are excellent insulators during the warm weather months and the plants cool the surrounding environment. Air quality is improved as the plants absorb carbon dioxide with concomitant production of oxygen. The city of New York determined that the cooling potential per area was highest for street trees, followed <b>by</b> <b>living</b> roofs, light covered surface, and open space planting. From the standpoint of cost effectiveness, light surfaces, light roofs, and curbside planting have lower costs per temperature reduction.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas where}} the least weasel is {{sympatric}} with the stoat, the two species {{compete with each other}} for rodent prey. The weasel manages to avoid too much competition <b>by</b> <b>living</b> in more upland areas, feeding on smaller prey and being capable of entering smaller holes. It actively avoids encounters with stoats, though female weasels are less likely to stop foraging in the presence of stoats, perhaps because their smaller size allows them to quickly escape into holes.|$|E

5|$|Many {{anthozoans}} are {{colonial and}} consist of multiple polyps {{with a common}} origin joined together <b>by</b> <b>living</b> material. The simplest arrangement is where a stolon runs along the substrate in a two dimensional lattice with polyps budding off at intervals. Alternatively, polyps may bud off from a sheet of living tissue, the coenosarc, which joins the polyps and anchors the colony to the substrate. The coenosarc may consist of a thin membrane from which the polyps project, as in most stony corals, or a thick fleshy mass in which the polyps are immersed apart from their oral discs, as in the soft corals.|$|E

5|$|The {{first line}} of defence {{consists}} in avoiding detection, through mechanisms such as camouflage, living underground, or nocturnality. Alternatively, prey animals may ward off attack, whether by advertising the presence of strong defences in aposematism, by mimicking animals which do possess such defences, by startling the attacker, by signalling to the predator that pursuit is not worthwhile, by distraction, by using defensive structures such as spines, and <b>by</b> <b>living</b> in a group. Members of groups are at reduced risk of predation, despite the increased conspicuousness of a group, through improved vigilance, predator confusion, and {{the likelihood that the}} predator will attack some other individual.|$|E
5|$|The {{genetic code}} is {{the set of}} rules by which {{information}} encoded within genetic material (DNA or mRNA sequences) is translated into proteins <b>by</b> <b>living</b> cells. Translation is accomplished by the ribosome, which links amino acids in an order specified by mRNA, using transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules to carry amino acids and to read the mRNA three nucleotides at a time. The genetic code is highly similar among all organisms and can be expressed in a simple table with 64 entries.|$|E

5|$|The main sub-traditions of Jainism have {{historically}} disagreed, with Digambaras (sky-clad, naked mendicant order) stating {{that a woman}} is by her nature and her body unable to practice asceticism, such as <b>by</b> <b>living</b> naked, and therefore she cannot achieve spiritual liberation because of her gender. She can at best, state the Digambara texts, live an ethical life so that she is reborn as {{a man in a}} future life. In this view, she is also viewed a threat to a monk's chastity. In contrast, Svetambaras (white-clad, wear clothes) have interpreted Mahavira's teaching as encouraging both males and females to pursue a mendicant ascetic life with the possibility of moksha (kaivalya, spiritual liberation) regardless of gender.|$|E
5|$|The two living non-archosaurian reptile taxa, {{testudines}} (turtles) and lepidosaurians (lizards and tuataras), {{along with}} choristoderes (semi-aquatic archosauromorphs that would die {{out in the}} early Miocene), survived across the K–Pg boundary. More than 80% of Cretaceous turtle species passed through the K–Pg boundary. Additionally, all six turtle families in existence {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous survived into the Paleogene and are represented <b>by</b> <b>living</b> species. Living lepidosaurs include the tuataras (the only living rhynchocephalians) and the squamates. The rhynchocephalians were a widespread and relatively successful group of lepidosaurians during the early Mesozoic, but began to decline by the mid-Cretaceous, although they were very successful in the Late Cretaceous of South America. They are represented today by a single genus, located exclusively in New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Wong {{stated that}} most people take for granted what they possess, and may be without {{identity}} or culture. Wong says his self-awareness, and what Hong Kong represents to him, stem from the years he spent abroad.

5|$|Young female tigers {{establish}} their first territories {{close to their}} mother's. The overlap between the female and her mother's territory reduces with time. Males, however, migrate further than their female counterparts and set out {{at a younger age}} to mark out their own area. A young male acquires territory either by seeking out an area devoid of other male tigers, or <b>by</b> <b>living</b> as a transient in another male's territory until he is older and strong enough to challenge the resident male. Young males seeking to establish themselves thereby comprise the highest mortality rate (30–35% per year) amongst adult tigers.|$|E
5|$|Animals may avoid {{becoming}} prey <b>by</b> <b>living</b> out {{of sight}} of predators, whether in caves, underground, or by being nocturnal. Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.|$|E
5|$|Biogeographical {{patterns}} and range distributions are explained or predicted through {{knowledge of a}} species' traits and niche requirements. Species have functional traits that are uniquely adapted to the ecological niche. A trait is a measurable property, phenotype, or characteristic of an organism that may influence its survival. Genes {{play an important role}} in the interplay of development and environmental expression of traits. Resident species evolve traits that are fitted to the selection pressures of their local environment. This tends to afford them a competitive advantage and discourages similarly adapted species from having an overlapping geographic range. The competitive exclusion principle states that two species cannot coexist indefinitely <b>by</b> <b>living</b> off the same limiting resource; one will always out-compete the other. When similarly adapted species overlap geographically, closer inspection reveals subtle ecological differences in their habitat or dietary requirements. Some models and empirical studies, however, suggest that disturbances can stabilize the co-evolution and shared niche occupancy of similar species inhabiting species-rich communities. The habitat plus the niche is called the ecotope, which is defined as the full range of environmental and biological variables affecting an entire species.|$|E
