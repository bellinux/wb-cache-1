40|$|Studies {{suggest that}} the {{physical}} environment can be important for patient comfort, patient safety, patient privacy, family integration with patient care, and staff working condition in adult intensive care units (ICUs). In {{the absence of any}} measuring scales, however, evaluations of the physical environment of ICUs in terms of any of these dimensions have remained vague. For rigorous evaluations of ICU designs from the viewpoint of clinical staff, a self-report instrument with several multiple-item scales was created. These scales were tested in a pilot survey that was administered among a small group of nurse managers and ICU directors at several <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> <b>example</b> sites. Reliability analysis of the survey data showed some scales to be internally consistent. For the other scales, factor analysis revealed multiple components, which were then combined to create additional subscales.

The results, limitations, and the future directions of the study are discussed.

40|$|Under today 2 ̆ 7 s {{competitive}} {{environments and}} globalisation trend, {{supply chain management}} has {{emerged as one of}} the <b>best</b> <b>practices</b> for corporations to gain competitive advantages.

In this paper, we extend the SCOR model by integrating collaborative product commerce and project management to propose a comprehensive collaborative supply chain operations reference model (CSCOR).

The conceptualization {{is based on}} a review of popular Open Data definitions and business ecosystem theories, which are applied to qualitative empirical data. The work is informed by a combination of discourse analysis and a content analysis of in-depth interviews, undertaken during the summer of 2013. Drawing on the UK as a <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> <b>example,</b> the authors examine a set of structural business ecosystem properties: circular flow of resources, sustainability, demand that encourages supply, and dependence developing between suppliers, intermediaries, and users. The authors identify that gaps and shortcomings remain. Most prominently, demand is not yet fully encouraging supply and actors have yet to experience fully mutual interdependence...|$|R
40|$|As Australia {{is moving}} towards a {{national}} curriculum {{there are also}} activities to nationalise teacher education.

These agencies are producing models and principles which aim on establishing standards of <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> for how they want teachers to teach. Within all of this activity the term ‘pedagogy’ is often employed to represent aspects of these <b>best</b> <b>practices.</b> <b>Examples</b> include ‘productive pedagogies’, ‘new pedagogies’, ‘pedagogical content knowledge’ and ‘pedagogical strategies’. However these are all means only without any end purposes which identify them as being valuable for education. In this paper I will argue that in order to have educative value teachers themselves must exercise a degree of professional autonomy to bring their own end purposes to their choice of pedagogy...|$|R
