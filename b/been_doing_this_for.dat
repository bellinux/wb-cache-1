According to a report by the Dawn newspaper, [...] "a black goat is {{slaughtered}} almost daily to ward off the 'evil eye' and protect President Zardari from 'black magic.'

500|$|The {{group also}} held an improvisational {{approach}} to live performances, which connected the band with jam band culture. [...] "Jazz and blues musicians have <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> decades, but I {{think they really}} brought that sense that anyone onstage can inspire anyone else {{at any given time}} to rock music," [...] said Haynes. [...] "We sure didn’t set out to be a [...] "jam band" [...] but those long jams just emanated from within the band, because we didn’t want to just play three minutes and be over," [...] said Allman. Rolling Stone referred to the group as [...] "without question the first great jam band, and they took the jam to heights that it had not previously reached." ...|$|E
500|$|Interested in a directorial career, Affleck shadowed John Frankenheimer {{throughout}} pre-production of {{the action}} thriller Reindeer Games (2000). Frankenheimer, directing his last feature film, described Affleck as having [...] "a very winning, likable quality about him. I've <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> {{a long time and}} he's really one of the nicest." [...] He starred opposite Charlize Theron as a hardened criminal, with Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times enjoying the unexpected casting choice: [...] "Affleck often suggests one of the Kennedys playing Clark Kent ... He looks as if he has never missed a party or a night's sleep. He's game, though, and his slight dislocation works to the advantage of Reindeer Games." [...] He then had a supporting role as a ruthless stockbroker in the crime drama Boiler Room (2000). A.O. Scott of The New York Times felt Affleck had [...] "traced over" [...] Alec Baldwin's performance in Glengarry Glen Ross, while Peter Rainer of New York Magazine said he [...] "does a series of riffs on Baldwin's aria, and each one is funnier and crueler than the next". He then provided the voice of Joseph in the animated [...] In his last film role of 2000, Affleck starred opposite his girlfriend Paltrow in the romantic drama Bounce. Stephen Holden of The New York Times praised the [...] "understated intensity and exquisite detail" [...] of his performance: [...] "His portrait of a young, sarcastically self-defined 'people person' who isn't half as confident as he would like to appear is close to definitive." ...|$|E

It’s the first time I’ve ever seen this, and I’ve <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> 25 years in the IRS, and 40 years total."

2500|$|When Nigel Farage was {{selected}} {{for an interview with}} ITV's Robert Peston instead of a Vote Leave representative, Vote Leave issued a statement accusing Peston of bias and threatening [...] "consequences" [...] for the broadcaster if Vote Leave members formed a government post-referendum. Michael Grade, Conservative life peer and former head of both the BBC and ITV, accused Vote Leave of using [...] "unacceptable" [...] "bullying tactics". In response, Farage said that [...] "I'm not going to compare myself to any of the others. ... But I do know the subject well.

2500|$|After the game, many sports writers {{commented on}} Warner's rise from an unknown backup to a Super Bowl MVP, but Warner himself wasn't {{impressed}} by it. [...] "How {{can you be}} in awe of something that you expect yourself to do?" [...] Warner pointed out. [...] "People think this season {{is the first time}} I touched a football; they don't realize I've <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> years – just not on this level, because I never got the chance. Sure, I had my tough times, but you don't sit there and say, 'Wow, I was stocking groceries five years ago, and look at me now.'

Redfoo said, [...] "I feel like we've <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> so long, four or five years" [...] and that he and SkyBlu would not be performing together anytime soon as they would be taking their careers in different directions. Once the news surfaced that band members Redfoo and SkyBlu had split, the group went to MTV News {{to set the record}} straight. SkyBlu said, [...] "Well, you know, first of all, we're not breaking up. I know that for sure. We're family and stuff, so it's always love ... It's interesting because somebody will say one thing [...] it's just like high school, {{then all of a sudden}} [...] 'They're breaking up. They're fighting.'" [...] However, it has been revealed by SkyBlu that their plan is for fans to see the band as individuals and then come back stronger than ever.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with PBS television, social historian Eric Lott said, [...] "all the citizens' councils in the South called Elvis 'nigger music' and were terribly afraid that Elvis, white as he was, being ambiguously raced just by being working-class, was going to corrupt the youth of America." [...] Robert Kaiser says {{he was the first}} who gave the people [...] "a music that hit them where they lived, deep in their emotions, yes, even below their belts. Other singers had <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> generations, but they were black." [...] Therefore, his performance style was frequently criticized. Social guardians blasted anyone responsible for exposing impressionable teenagers to his [...] "gyrating figure and suggestive gestures." [...] The Louisville chief of police, for instance, called for a no-wiggle rule, so as to halt [...] "any lewd, lascivious contortions that would excite the crowd." [...] Even Priscilla Presley confirms that [...] "his performances were labeled obscene. My mother stated emphatically that he was 'a bad influence for teenage girls. He arouses things in them that shouldn't be aroused.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Clarkson's debut album, Thankful, was {{released}} on April 15, 2003. The album contained aspects of pop, contemporary R, and gospel music, with several established musicians such as Rhett Lawrence, Diane Warren, The Underdogs, and Babyface contributing on to the tracks. Released during the urban-R dominance, the album was well received by several critics. AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the album for its vocal ability: [...] "throughout this record, (Clarkson) makes it seem effortless and charming. She can croon, she can belt out a song, she can be sexy and sassy while still being graceful and as wholesome as the girl next door." [...] Henry Goldblatt of Entertainment Weekly remarked: [...] "Clarkson glides through octaves with the masterful control of someone who's <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> decades." [...] Thankful was a commercial success, debuting at {{number one on the}} Billboard 200 chart and went on to sell over 4.5 million copies worldwide. It was later certified double platinum by the RIAA, platinum in Canada, and gold in Japan and Australia.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} after his arrest, Moskvin explained {{that as an}} expert on Celtic culture, he had learned that the ancient Druids slept on graves in order to communicate with spirits of their dead. He also studied {{the culture of the}} peoples of Siberia, in particular, the culture of the ancient Yakuts, and discovered they had a similar practice for communicating with the dead. Moskvin began searching for obituaries of recently dead children. When he found an obituary that [...] "spoke" [...] to him, he would sleep on her grave in order to determine if the child's spirit wished to be brought back to life. Moskvin claimed he had <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> around twenty years and insisted that when he began, he never dug up a grave without the permission of the child within. As he grew older, it became physically painful for him to sleep on the graves, so he began bringing the bodies home where it would be more comfortable to sleep near them. He hoped the spirits would be more willing to speak in a safe, welcoming home and that they might be easier for him to hear when they were no longer underground.|$|E
2500|$|New Bedford was {{featured}} on America's Most Wanted on February 11, 2006, for three unsolved murders: that of Marcus Cruz in 2001, Cecil Lopes III in 2004, and Dana Haywood in 2005, run {{as part of}} a report on the Stop Snitching phenomenon that has hindered police investigations nationwide. [...] "Americas Most Wanted" [...] senior correspondent Tom Morris, who spoke with sources in New Bedford for the piece, said he usually cannot discuss the number or content of calls in response to a particular segment. But he said he'd make an exception in this case. [...] "I was amazed at how minimal the response was. I'm still wondering if we actually aired the show or not," [...] he said. [...] "We expected people to call in and maybe say 'Hey, I was there July 4 when Dana Haywood was killed' ... but we received no useful information." [...] The show received just a handful of calls and one e-mail thanking its producers for running it, the fewest ever for any episode in the show's history, Mr. Morris said. [...] "I've <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> 13 years," [...] he said. [...] "I was really surprised by this." [...] He said the show, which aired Feb. 11, received good ratings.|$|E

Let us admit the divisibility of the Crown. Let us sink into anonymity and cancel the word 'British' from our titles.

60|$|The house-party at the Keiths had {{originally}} been, from Martin's view-point, almost ideal. The {{rest of the}} men were of the speechless, moustache-tugging breed. They had come to shoot, and they shot. When they were not shooting they congregated in the billiard-room and devoted their powerful intellects exclusively to snooker-pool, leaving Martin free to talk undisturbed to Elsa. He had <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> five days with great contentment when Aubrey Barstowe arrived. Mrs Keith had developed of late leanings towards culture. In her town house a charge of small-shot, fired in any direction on a Thursday afternoon, could not have failed to bring down a poet, a novelist, or a painter. Aubrey Barstowe, author of The Soul's Eclipse and other poems, was a constant member of the crowd. A youth of insinuating manners, he had appealed to Mrs Keith from the start; and unfortunately the virus had extended to Elsa. Many a pleasant, sunshiny Thursday afternoon had been poisoned for Martin by the sight of Aubrey and Elsa together on a distant settee, matching temperaments. The rest is too painful. It was a rout. The poet did not shoot, so that when Martin returned of an evening his rival was about five hours of soul-to-soul talk up and only two to play. And those two, the after-dinner hours, which had once been the hours for which Martin had lived, were pure torture.|$|E
