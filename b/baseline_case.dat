40|$|Globally, {{there has}} been growing {{evidence}} that suggests the effectiveness of active case finding (ACF) for tuberculosis (TB) in high-risk populations. However, the evidence is still insufficient as to whether ACF increases case notification beyond what is reported in the routine passive case finding (PCF). In Cambodia, National TB Control Programme has conducted nationwide ACF with Xpert MTB/RIF that retrospectively targeted household and neighbourhood contacts alongside routine PCF. This study aims to investigate the impact of ACF on case notifications {{during and after the}} intervention period. Using a quasi-experimental cluster randomized design with intervention and control arms, we compared TB case notification during the one-year intervention period with historical <b>baseline</b> <b>cases</b> and trend-adjusted expected cases, and estimated additional cases notified during the intervention period (separately for Year 1 and Year 2 implementation). The proportion of change in case notification was compared between intervention and control districts for Year 1. The quarterly case notification data from all intervention districts were consolidated, aligning different implementation quarters, and separately analysed to explore the additionality. The effect of the intervention on the subsequent case notification during the post-intervention period was also assessed. In Year 1, as compared to expected cases, 1467 cases of all forms (18. 5 %) and 330 bacteriologically-confirmed cases (9. 6 %) were additionally notified in intervention districts, whereas case notification in control districts decreased by 2. 4 % and 2. 3 %, respectively. In Year 2, 2737 cases of all forms (44. 3 %) and 793 bacteriologically-confirmed cases (38 %) were additionally notified as compared to expected cases. The proportions of increase in <b>case</b> notifications from <b>baseline</b> <b>cases</b> and expected cases to intervention period cases were consistently higher in intervention group than in control group. The consolidated quarterly data showed sharp rises in all forms and bacteriologically-confirmed cases notified during the intervention quarter, with 64. 6 % and 68. 4 % increases (compared to <b>baseline</b> <b>cases),</b> and 46 % and 52. 9 % increases (compared to expected cases), respectively. A cumulative reduction of case notification for five quarters after ACF reached more than - 200 % of additional cases.

5000|$|The International Energy Agency (IEA) saw overall stagnating annual {{installations}} {{in the range}} of 36-39 GW until 2020, when global capacity would reach 403 GW, according to the highlighted <b>baseline</b> <b>case</b> scenario of the Medium Term Renewable Energy Market 2014 report. Paradoxically, since the report's 2013-edition, projected cumulative for 2018 had increased by 6% from 308 GW to 326 GW, while the corresponding annual deployment decreased. This was {{due to the fact that}} the International Energy Agency adjusted annual installations upward on the near-end - in order to meet actual deployment, while reducing estimates on the far-end. The result was a flat curve that stayed below 40 GW until 2020 (see table). For 2017, the projected low of 36 GW concided with the scheduled expiration of the solar investment tax credit (ITC) in the U.S. and the expected end of the solar boom in Japan. IEA's projected annual installation of less than 40 GW also lead to a negative growth rate, since expectations for 2015 were much higher. Such a decline, however, would have been unprecedented and has never been observed in the recorded history of solar PV deployment. This scenario made IEA's <b>baseline</b> <b>case</b> the most conservative of all projections. In the less featured enhanced high case scenario, IEA estimated that [...] "solar PV could reach a cumulative 465 GW to 515 GW in 2020" [...] and that [...] "solar PV capacity could top 500 GW globally in 2020".|$|E

The medium scenario therefore expected annual PV installations to grow from 50 GW to 70 GW and to reach 536 GW by 2020. PVMA's figures were in line with those published earlier by Solar Power Europe. In June 2015, Greentech Media (GTM) Research released its Global PV Demand Outlook for 2020. The company projected annual installations to increase from 40 GW to 135 GW and global cumulative capacity to reach almost 700 GW by 2020. GTM's outlook was the most aggressive of all forecasts in 2015, with projected deployment of 518 GW between 2015 and 2020, or {{more than twice as}} much as IEA's 225 GW <b>baseline</b> <b>case</b> scenario, published ten months earlier.|$|E

In our presentation we will discuss our evaluation {{of the performance of}} 13 shortwave and 11 longwave RT codes that participated in Phase I of CIRC. CIRC differs from previous intercomparisons in that it relies on an observationally validated catalogue of cases. The seven CIRC Phase I <b>baseline</b> <b>cases,</b> five cloud-free, and two with overcast liquid clouds, are built around observations by the Atmospheric Radiation Measurements (ARM) program that satisfy the goals. of Phase I, namely to examine RT model performance in realistic, yet not overly complex, atmospheric conditions. Besides the seven <b>baseline</b> <b>cases,</b> additional idealized "subcases" are also examined to facilitate interpretation of model errors. We will quantify individual model performance with respect to reference line-by-line calculations, and will also highlight RT code behavior for conditions of doubled CO 2, aspects of utilizing a spectral specification of surface albedo, and the impact of the inclusion of scattering in the thermal infrared. Our analysis suggests that RT codes should work towards improving their calculation of diffuse shortwave flux, shortwave absorption, treatment of spectral surface albedo, and shortwave CO 2 forcing. Despite practical difficulties in comparing our results to previous results by the Intercomparison of Radiation Codes in Climate Models (ICRCCM) conducted about 20 years ago, it appears that the current generation of RT codes do indeed perform better than the codes of the ICRCCM era. By enhancing the range of conditions under which participating codes are tested, future CIRC phases will hopefully allow even more rigorous examination of RT code performance...|$|R

In this project, we are investigating helium Brayton cycles for the secondary side of an indirect energy conversion system. Ultimately we will investigate {{the improvement of the}} Brayton cycle using other fluids, such as supercritical carbon dioxide. Prior to the cycle improvement study, we established a number of <b>baseline</b> <b>cases</b> for the helium indirect Brayton cycle. These cases look at both single-shaft and multiple-shaft turbomachinary. The <b>baseline</b> <b>cases</b> are based on a 250 MW thermal pebble bed HTGR. The results from this study are applicable to other reactor concepts such as a very high temperature gas-cooled reactor (VHTR), fast gas-cooled reactor (FGR), supercritical water reactor (SWR), and others. In this study, we are using the HYSYS computer code for optimization of the helium Brayton cycle. Besides the HYSYS process optimization, we performed parametric study to see the effect of important parameters on the cycle efficiency. For these parametric calculations, we use a cycle efficiency model that was developed based on the Visual Basic computer language. As a part of this study we are currently investigated single-shaft vs. multiple shaft arrangement for cycle efficiency and comparison, which will be published in the next paper.
