40|$|Given a <b>banded</b> <b>block</b> Toeplitz matrix with <b>banded</b> Toeplitz <b>blocks,</b> H, an {{inexpensive}} technique for decomposing H into a sum of Kronecker products is presented. Applications to image restoration are discussed. 1. Introduction. Block Toeplitz matrices with Toeplitz blocks occur often in signal and image processing applications. In many cases these matrices are also <b>block</b> <b>banded</b> with <b>banded</b> <b>blocks.</b> In this paper we consider such matrices and show {{how they can}} be written as the sum of Kronecker products of (point) banded Toeplitz matrices. Moreover, this decomposition is easily obtained by computing a singular value decomposition (SVD) of a matrix of small dimension compared to that of the original block Toeplitz matrix. One application where these matrices arise is in image restoration. This is the process of removing or minimizing degradations (typically blur) in an observed image. A linear discrete model of image restoration is the matrix-vector equation g = Hf + j; where g is the ob [...] ...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} <b>banded</b> <b>block</b> Toeplitz matrices T_n with n block {{rows and}} columns. We show that under certain technical assumptions, the normalized eigenvalue counting measure of T_n for n→∞ weakly converges to {{one component of}} the unique vector of measures that minimizes a certain energy functional. In this way we generalize a recent result of Duits and Kuijlaars for the scalar case. Along the way we also obtain an equilibrium problem associated to an arbitrary algebraic curve, not necessarily related to a block Toeplitz matrix. For <b>banded</b> <b>block</b> Toeplitz matrices, there are several new phenomena that do not occur in the scalar case: (i) The total masses of the equilibrium measures do not necessarily form a simple arithmetic series but in general are obtained through a combinatorial rule; (ii) The limiting eigenvalue distribution may contain point masses, {{and there may be}} attracting point sources in the equilibrium problem; (iii) More seriously, there are examples where the connection between the limiting eigenvalue distribution of T_n and the solution to the equilibrium problem breaks down. We provide sufficient conditions guaranteeing that no such breakdown occurs; in particular we show this if T_n is a Hessenberg matrix. Comment: 32 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

40|$|In many 2 D image {{restoration}} problems, such as image deblurring with Dirichlet boundary conditions, {{we deal with}} two-level linear systems whose coefficient matrix is a <b>banded</b> <b>block</b> Toeplitz matrix with <b>banded</b> Toeplitz <b>blocks</b> (BTTB). Usually, these matrices are ill-conditioned since they are associated to generating functions which vanish at (pi, pi) or in neighborhood of it. In this work, we solve such BTTB systems by applying an Algebraic Multi-Grid method (AMG). The technique we propose has an optimality property, i. e., its cost is of O(n 1 · n 2) arithmetic operations, where n 1 × n 2 {{is the size of}} the images. Unfortunately, in the case of images affected by noise, our AMG method does not provide satisfactory regularization effects. Therefore, we propose two Tikhonov-like techniques, based on a regularization parameter, which can be applied to AMG method {{in order to reduce the}} noise effects...|$|R

Whereas continuous shields essentially attenuate all frequencies above the skin depth, the holes in a cage can permit higher frequencies to diffract through them or set up evanescent waves a short distance inside the surface.
