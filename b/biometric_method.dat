40|$|Abstract:- Biometrics is the {{automated}} use of physiological or behavioral characteristics to determine or verify identity. Finger-scan, facial-scan, iris-scan, hand-scan, and retina-scan are considered physiological biometrics, based on direct measurements {{of a part}} of the human body. Each <b>biometric</b> <b>method</b> has its strengths and weaknesses. The skin-dependant <b>biometric</b> <b>method</b> (finger-scan, and hand-scan) have their weakness on the factor of skin elasticity and deformation. This paper examines the effects of pressure on skin and simultaneously the accuracy of finger matching. The model accounts for the various levels of dynamic non-linearity that exist during the capture of the data for fingerprint...|$|E

40|$|This report {{discusses}} {{the use of}} the iris-based biometric recognition. Biometric recognition is the automated recognition of individuals based on the physiological and behavioral characteristics. The recognition can be positive or negative. It highlights the key areas where the iris <b>biometric</b> <b>method</b> has been used successfully, and what are its shortfalls. It presents an overview of the algorithm used in Iris biometric recognition. It also compares the performance of the Iris <b>biometric</b> <b>method</b> with the other biometric methods in terms of cost-effectiveness, usability, speed and other factors. The iris is very unique in that it has many features such as crypts, furrows and collarettes, which are used by the algorithms for comparison between a template and an image acquired for recognition. Most of the algorithms used for iris recognition have a very low false acceptance rate compared to the other biometric methods, and these algorithms can do millions of comparisons on easily available hardware. 1...|$|E
