Matthew, alias Mathias to {{everyone}} in JG 27, was a <b>black</b> <b>South</b> African soldier taken prisoner of war by German troops {{on the morning of}} 21 June 1941 at fortress Tobruk. Mathias initially worked as a volunteer driver with 3. Staffel then befriended Marseille and became his domestic helper in Africa.|$|E
5|$|These {{terms were}} {{initially}} applied to British people perceived as prejudiced against the Boers, {{in the context}} of political conflict between the British and the Boers in southern Africa which culminated in the British defeat of the Boers in the Second Boer War. Accusations of Boerehaat have subsequently been made by Afrikaner nationalists to exploit historical British prejudice against the Boers for political gain. They have applied the term Boerehater to anyone who criticised them or opposed their interests in the Cape Colony, including English-speaking white South Africans, dissident Afrikaners and <b>black</b> <b>South</b> Africans.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, President F.W. de Klerk started {{negotiations}} to end apartheid in South Africa with Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC). During negotiation, the white South African Rugby Board and the non-racial South African Rugby Union merged {{to create the}} South African Rugby Football Union. Rugby {{at the time was}} seen by <b>black</b> <b>South</b> Africans as a symbol of white supremacy. The ANC demanded that the new SARFU improve development of black players. This was because the Springboks team consisted solely of white players at the time, though black players were eligible for selection for the Springboks following the merger of the two governing bodies. Following the yes vote in the South African apartheid referendum in March 1992, the IRB lifted restrictions on tours of South Africa. It was announced that the return test would be against New Zealand. This was criticised in South Africa as the Springboks had not played full international rugby for 11 years and it was felt it would not be competitive however New Zealand were invited because it was felt appropriate after the events around the 1981 South Africa rugby union tour.|$|E
5|$|On 16 October 1999, Makeba {{was named}} a Goodwill Ambassador of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. In January 2000, her album, Homeland, {{produced}} by the New York City based record label Putumayo World Music, {{was nominated for a}} Grammy Award in the Best World Music Album category. She worked closely with Graça Machel-Mandela, the South African first lady, advocating for children suffering from HIV/AIDS, child soldiers, and the physically handicapped. She established the Makeba Centre for Girls, a home for orphans, described in an obituary as her most personal project. She also took part in the 2002 documentary , which examined the struggles of <b>black</b> <b>South</b> Africans against apartheid through the music of the period. Makeba's second autobiography, Makeba: The Miriam Makeba Story, was published in 2004. In 2005 she announced that she would retire and began a farewell tour, but despite having osteoarthritis, continued to perform until her death. During this period, her grandchildren Nelson Lumumba Lee and Zenzi Lee, and her great-grandchild Lindelani, occasionally joined her performances.|$|E

25|$|The ANC {{responded to}} {{attacks on the}} rights of <b>black</b> <b>South</b> Africans, as well as calling for strikes, boycotts, and defiance.

The government tried to stop the ANC by banning party leaders and enacting new laws to stop the ANC, however these measures ultimately proved to be ineffective.|$|E
25|$|Coloured {{people were}} subject to forced relocation. For instance, the {{government}} relocated Coloured from the urban Cape Town areas of District Six, which was later bulldozed. Other areas {{they were forced to}} leave included Constantia, Claremont, Simon's Town. Inhabitants were moved to racially designated sections of the metropolitan area on the Cape Flats. Additionally, under apartheid, Coloured people received educations inferior to that of Whites. It was, however, better than that provided to <b>Black</b> <b>South</b> Africans.|$|E

However, after already having lost his place in the ODI side, he was dropped from the Test side after poor performances against England.|$|E

25|$|President Nelson Mandela, {{wearing a}} Springbok shirt, {{presented}} the trophy to captain Francois Pienaar, a white Afrikaner. The gesture was {{widely seen as}} a major step towards the reconciliation of white and <b>black</b> <b>South</b> Africans. The combined exploits of Mandela and the Springboks in helping unify the country through rugby union was later chronicled in John Carlin's book , which in turn inspired Clint Eastwood's 2009 Academy Award-nominated film Invictus starring Matt Damon as Pienaar and Morgan Freeman as Mandela.|$|E
25|$|The Wits SRC {{academic}} boycott has {{not been}} renewed since it was passed in 2012 and is defacto no longer operable at the institution. A number of Wits SRC and former Wits SRC members have visited the country and talked about their experiences.

The government succeeded in stripping <b>black</b> <b>South</b> Africans of the vote, and adopted a policy of apartheid that led to violence, discrimination and repression worse, no doubt, than Innes had foreseen.|$|E

She had stood against other male candidates and talking through an interpreter had managed to win the electorate's confidence.

25|$|In April 2017 the LDS Church {{announced}} {{plans to build a}} temple in Nairobi, Kenya bringing to 6 the temples planned or built in Africa outside South Africa. In 2017 two <b>black</b> <b>South</b> African men were called to serve as mission presidents. Regarding the LDS Church in Africa, professor Philip Jenkins noted in 2009 that LDS growth has been slower than that of other churches due to a number of reasons, one being the white face of the church due to the priesthood ban, and another being the church's refusal to accommodate local customs like polygamy.|$|E
25|$|Timing was a {{key factor}} in the ensuing events, as the {{different}} states of southern Africa were at the time still suspicious and resentful after the last bout of British imperial expansion. The Afrikaners resented the recent annexation of the Transvaal, did not support confederation, and would successfully rebel in the First Boer War. The various <b>Black</b> <b>South</b> African states were also suspicious of this new effort towards British expansion. The ill-advised policies of both Frere and his local ally, John Gordon Sprigg, ended up causing a string of wars across Southern Africa, culminating in the disastrous Anglo-Zulu and Boer Wars.|$|E
