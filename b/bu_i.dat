40|$|Two major {{topics are}} covered: {{the first chapter}} {{is focused on the}} {{development}} of post-metallocene complexes for propylene polymerization. The second and third chapters investigate the consequences of diisobutylaluminum hydride (HAl <b>i</b> <b>Bu</b> 2) additives in zirconocene based polymerization systems. The synthesis, structure, and solution behavior of early metal complexes with a new tridentate LX 2 type ligand, bis(thiophenolate) pyridine ((SNS) = (2 -C 6 H 4 S) 2 - 2, 6 -C 5 H 3 N) are investigated. SNS complexes of Ti, Zr, and Ta having dialkylamido coligands were synthesized and structurally characterized. The zirconium complex, (SNS) Zr(NMe 2) 2, displays C 2 symmetry in the solid state. Solid-state structures of tantalum complexes (SNS) Ta(NMe 2) 3 and (SNS) TaCl(NEt 2) 2 also display pronounced C 2 twisting of the SNS ligand. 1 D and 2 D NMR experiments show that (SNS) Ta(NMe 2) 3 is fluxional with rotation about the Ta N(amide) bonds occurring on the NMR timescale. The fluxional behavior of (SNS) TaCl(NEt 2) 2 in solution was also studied by variable temperature 1 H NMR. Observation of separate signals for the diastereotopic protons of the methylene unit of the diethylamide indicates that the complex remains locked on the NMR timescale in one diastereomeric conformation at temperatures below - 50 °C. Reduction of Zr(IV) metallocenium cations with sodium amalgam (NaHg) produces EPR signals assignable to Zr(III) metallocene complexes. Thus, chloro-bridged heterobinuclear ansa-zirconocenium cation [((SBI)) Zr(&# 956;-Cl) 2 AlMe 2] + B(C 6 F 5) 4 &# 175; (SBI = rac-dimethylsilylbis(1 -indenyl)), gives rise to an EPR signal assignable to the complex (SBI) Zr III (&# 956;-Cl) 2 AlMe 2, while (SBI) Zr III -Me and (SBI) Zr III (-H) 2 Al <b>i</b> <b>Bu</b> 2 are formed by reduction of [(SBI) Zr(&# 956;-Me) 2 AlMe 2] + B(C 6 F 5) 4 &# 175; and [(SBI) Zr(&# 956;-H) 3 (Al <b>i</b> <b>Bu</b> 2) 2] + B(C 6 F 5) 4 &# 175;, respectively. These products are also formed, along with (SBI) Zr III - <b>i</b> <b>Bu</b> and [(SBI) Zr III] + AlR 4 &# 175; when (SBI) ZrMe 2 reacts with HAl <b>i</b> <b>Bu</b> 2, eliminating isobutane en route to the Zr(III) complex. Studies concerning the interconversion reactions between these and other (SBI) Zr(III) complexes and reaction mechanisms involved in their formation are also reported. The addition of HAl <b>i</b> <b>Bu</b> 2 to precatalyst [(SBI) Zr(µ-H) 3 (Al <b>i</b> <b>Bu</b> 2) 2] + significantly slows the polymerization of propylene and changes the kinetics of polymerization from 1 st to 2 nd order with respect to propylene. This is likely due to competitive inhibition by HAl <b>i</b> <b>Bu</b> 2. When the same reaction is investigated using [(n BuCp) 2 Zr(&# 956;-H) 3 (Al <b>i</b> <b>Bu</b> 2) 2] +, hydroalumination between propylene and HAl <b>i</b> <b>Bu</b> 2 is observed instead of propylene polymerization. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the synthesis and characterisation {{of a series}} of cationic rhodium bis -phosphine complexes. The reactivity of these new complexes in the solid-state and in solution is reported. In Chapter 2 the synthesis {{of a series of}} rhodium bis-phosphine diene complexes is presented and the reactions of these complexes with hydrogen in the solid-state are investigated. Several examples of zwitterionic complexes coordinating the [BAr F 4] ─ anion are produced by hydrogenation. A rare example of a sigma-alkane complex, [Rh(i Bu 2 PCH 2 CH 2 P <b>i</b> <b>Bu</b> 2) (eta 2 - CH -eta 2 - CH -NBA][BAr F 4] ─ <b>i</b> <b>Bu</b> 2 PCH 2 CH 2 P <b>i</b> <b>Bu</b> 2) (eta 2 - CH -eta 2 - CH -NBE][BAr F 4] may form as a short lived intermediate prior to the formation of the sigma-alkane complex. The temporal evolution of the solid-state hydrogenation reactions is monitored by powder X-ray diffraction methods. In Chapter 3 the C−X activation of various aryl halides using the [Rh(i Bu 2 PCH 2 CH 2 P <b>i</b> <b>Bu</b> 2) ] + fragment is reported. The 'ligand innocence' of the phosphine with respect to intramolecular C−H activation is also discussed. A rare example of C−X activation in the solid-state is presented, which shows the formation of an isomer that is not observed by analogous solution routes. Chapter 4 investigates solid-state ligand exchange reactions using ethene, butadiene, CO and NH 3 gases. A solid-state transfer dehydrogenation reaction is reported within single crystals of [Rh(i Bu 2 PCH 2 CH 2 P <b>i</b> <b>Bu</b> 2) (C 2 H 4) 2][BAr F 4]. H/D exchange of NH 3 can also occur in the solid state in the bis-ammonia complex [Rh(i Bu 2 PCH 2 CH 2 P <b>i</b> <b>Bu</b> 2) (NH 3) 2][BAr F 4]. A variety of rhodium complexes are tested as heterogeneous catalysts for the hydrogenation of ethene and the isomerisation of butene.

The dependence upon the arene substituents, phosphine substituents and phosphine bite angle are discussed. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|R

The cathode compartment con-tained mixed solutions of sodium bicarbonate and chloride in different propor-tions and of total normality 0. 05. It was found that in all three membranes preferential transport of chloride takes place, that the electroosmotic transport of water with bicarbonate is higher than with chloride and that the electro-osmotic water transport varies {{in the same order}} as the water content of the chloride forms of the membranes expressed in terms of moles H 20 per equivalent C 1 -.

THE SECRET OF SUCCESS IN INSURANCE Before we tackle the peculiar problems of natural disaster in-surance it is worth having a look at why insurance works so well in practice.

Examples of this trend are the growing number of networks of'small computers and the increasing variety of intelligent computer peripherals and instruments. Fig. 1 shows a block diagram of a typical measurement and control system based on the 224 OA Measurement and Control Processor. Analog and digital interfaces plug into the 2240 A to interface to various sensors, switches, controls, and actuators (see Fig, 2). The processor's communication link to the computer is the Hewlett-Packard Interface Bus, or HP-IB, Hewlett-Packard's implementation of IEEE standard 488 - 1975 (ANSI standard MC 1. 1). Careful design of message protocol and data formats makes the 224 OA compatible with virtually any computer, calculator, or intelligent terminal that supports the HP-IB. Using standard HP-IB cables, the 224 OA can be located up to 20 metres (65 feet) from the computer or other controller. For remote applications, the HP-IB can be brought to the 224 oA by any of a variety of multidrop, point-to-point, or telephone line interfaces. For example, an HP 30708 Terminal (see article, page 19) {{can be used as a}} parallel-to-serial interface to a twin-conductor cable system that allows 224 OAs to be located up to 2 km (1. 2 miles) from a computer.

40|$|In {{the last}} five years the European {{institutional}} architecture of banking regulation and supervision has undergone sweeping changes, brought about by a number of sequential legislative initiatives. Such a "Copernican revolution" naturally calls for investigating whether and how these different layers of reforms add up to (or can be interpreted in a way that ensure) an overall consistent, efficient and effective design for banking regulation and supervision. This is particularly the case for the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the Banking Union (BU), two new institutional players which in the public debate are sometimes dubbed as overlapping or even conflicting. The paper provides a critical analysis of this interplay and its components, also with the aim to provide food for thought for further exploration, from a private as well as a public law perspective. It starts from the reasons behind the foundation of the EBA and the BU, to show how these new institutional players in fact were created to pursue two distinct and complementary goals, and operate on two separate but interconnected institutional levels. The paper then dwells on the panoply of innovative regulatory tools which the EBA can dispose of in order to accomplish its mission to foster maximum harmonization {{and the creation of a}} single set of common rules (the “Single rulebook” or SR) : technical standards, guidelines and recommendations, and other “soft law” instruments, such as the Q&A tool. The analysis aims to stimulate further critical thinking on the scope and possible impact of these tools, and their consistency within the overall European framework of legal sources. Hence, the focus moves on the main areas covered by the SR (i. e. prudential rules and resolution) and the priorities followed in its build up, highlighting how these priorities can contribute to the effective functioning of the two current components of the <b>BU,</b> <b>i.</b> e. the SSM and the SRM. The paper concludes with some remarks on areas of possible improvement and development, underlining the need to: i) step up the harmonization of corporate and insolvency laws, given their impact on cross-border banking and cross-border resolution; ii) provide more certainty on the scope and possible effects of EBA’s mediation role; iii) rethink the governance of the EBA, if one wants to get to a more balanced interplay between national and European drivers...|$|E

The driving force of the Coulomb induced dimerization is the nearest neighbour exchange interaction. The lattice dimerization in polyacetylene is due to the Coulomb mechanism. The SSH model is implicitly taking into account the nearest neighbour exchange interac-tion. The Franck-Condon band gap is mostly determined by the nearest neighbour exchange interaction. The IBu excited state is excitonic. The exciton binding energy is estimated for the effective Coulomb potential with the screened long range part. It is not large owing to very small effective mass of electron and hole. To explain the observed <b>I</b> <b>Bu</b> excitation energy, the short range part of the effective Coulomb potential must be screened by about half compared to the one in small conjugate molecules. The condition for splitting of the exciton into a zwitter-ionic pair of charged solitons is discussed...|$|R

After graduating in 1942, Sylos Labini won a fellowship in the USA. After an initial period in Chicago, he moved to Harvard, where he was able to attend Schumpeter’s lectures from 1948 to 1950. During this period, Sylos Labini read Schumpeter’s Business Cycles and decided to write down his impressions before giving them to his former professor in February 1949, who discussed them over a couple of lessons. These notes are still unpublished, and Sylos gave me a copy at our first meeting (2002), saying that it was time to publish them. This paper discusses the content of the unpublished notes, focusing on the critical aspects of Schumpeter’s business cycle theory to which Labini draws attention. In the last section, I present Sylos Labini’s business cycle theory, an interesting mix of Schumpeterian, Keynesian and Marxian elements...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHepatic venoocclusive disease (HVOD) is a {{complication}} of allogeneic {{hematopoietic stem cell}} transplantation (HSCT) and is a well-recognized dose-limiting toxicity of oral busulfan (Bu) -based preparative regimens. The unpredictable absorption of oral Bu from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and hepatic first-pass effects {{have led to the}} development of an intravenous <b>Bu</b> preparation (<b>i.</b> v. <b>Bu).</b> The purpose of this retrospective comparison was to evaluate the incidence rate of HVOD and the 100 -day mortality rate in patients treated with a busulfan/cyclophosphamide (BuCy 2) regimen in which either oral <b>Bu</b> or <b>i.</b> v. <b>Bu</b> was administered. Data from 2 similar groups of patients treated between March 1995 and December 1997 were analyzed. Thirty patients were treated with oral Bu (1 mg/kg x 16 doses) at City of Hope and 61 patients were treated with <b>i.</b> v. <b>Bu</b> (0. 8 mg/kg x 16 doses) in a multicenter trial involving 7 sites. Bu was followed by Cy (60 mg/kg x 2 days) and a histocompatible-sibling-donor HSCT. In the <b>i.</b> v. <b>Bu</b> treatment group, 48 % of the patients were classified as heavily pretreated (> or = 3 prior chemotherapy regimens, prior radiation, or prior HSCT) with 13 % having had a prior HSCT and 75 % having active disease at the time of transplantation. According to the same classification criteria, 33 % of the patients in the oral-Bu treatment group were considered heavily pretreated, with 23 % having had a prior HSCT and 80 % having active disease at the time of transplantation. The incidence rates of clinically diagnosed HVOD were 5 / 61 (8 %) and 10 / 30 (33 %) after i. v. and oral Bu, respectively. HVOD-related mortality occurred in 2 (3. 3 %) of 61 i. v. and 6 (20 %) of 30 oral Bu patients. The (standardized) Jones criteria for HVOD were met by 4. 9 % of i. v. and 20 % of oral Bu patients. Univariate logistic regression analysis identified oral versus <b>i.</b> v. <b>Bu</b> (P =. 001) and a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (P =. 04) as statistically significant factors in the development of HVOD, with prior extensive treatment identified as marginally significant (P =. 25). No other demographic parameter was found to be significant. After adjustment for prior treatment, multivariate analyses showed that the use of oral versus <b>i.</b> v. <b>Bu</b> was the strongest predictor for development of HVOD (odds ratio, 7. 5; 95 % confidence interval, 2. 1 - 27. 2; P =. 002). This study showed that the incidence rate of HVOD is significantly lower (P =. 002) and the 100 -day survival rate significantly higher (P =. 002) in patients treated with <b>i.</b> v. <b>Bu</b> than in patients treated with oral Bu when Bu is used as part of a BuCy 2 preparative regimen for allogeneic HSCT.

In this work, {{the samples}} were fabricated by using Solid State Reaction (SSR) in two groups. The first goup is (Y 1 -xYbx/ 2 Gdx/ 2) Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7 -d {{and the second is}} (Yb 1 - xGdx) Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7 -d and six ratios of x = 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 6, 0, 8 and 1, 0 were chosen for each group. The superconducting structural properties were examined by using Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA), Dilatometer, Densitometer, X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD) and Polarized-light Optical Microscopy and the physical properties of all {{the samples were}} examined using low temperature (5 - 300 K) resistance and magnetization measurements. Using the results of the measurements, it was shown that the both substitutions Yb and Gd in the first group entered into the unit cell and affected the superconducting properties. Because of opposite and different influence of quantity of Yb and Gd on superconductivity, the lattice parameters have not shown a direct proportionality with increasing x. It was found that this difference has similar effect on physical properties such as upper critical magnetic field (Hc 2), activation energy, magnetization and critical current density (Jc) for the first group. It was seen that c lattice parameters calculated from XRD patterns of the second group samples has direct proportionality with increasing x value. From experiments, it was resulted that the Hc 2 values have shown decreasing effect for the ratio below 0. 6, and these values indicate increasing effect above 0. 6 while c lattice parameter increasing. From these results, it was thought that the Hc 2 value could be adjusted by ratio of x. The upper critical magnetic fields at 0 K for the first and second groups are found to be 83 T ? 112, 5 T, and 73 T ? 184, 5 T respectively. In addition, from magnetization measurements, the increasing x ratio in the first group has shown slow changing the diamagnetic structure to the paramagnetic property although this transformation becomes faster in the second group samples. The critical current densities have not shown big differences with variation of doping concentration for each group...|$|R
