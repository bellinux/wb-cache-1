2500|$|The {{process of}} {{institution}} {{building in the}} financial sector in Mexico has evolved {{hand in hand with}} the efforts of financial liberalization and of inserting the economy more fully into world markets. Over the recent years, there has been a wave of acquisitions by foreign institutions such as US-based Citigroup, Spain’s BBVA and the UK’s HSBC. Their presence, along with a better regulatory framework, has allowed Mexico’s banking system to recover from the 1994–95 peso devaluation. Lending to the public and private sector is increasing and so is activity in the areas of insurance, leasing and mortgages. However, bank credit accounts for only 22% of GDP, which is significantly low compared to 70% in Chile. Credit to the Agricultural sector has fallen 45.5% in six years (2001 to 2007), and now represents about 1% of total bank loans. Other important institutions include savings and loans, credit unions (known as [...] "cajas populares"), government development banks, “non-bank banks”, <b>bonded</b> <b>warehouses,</b> bonding companies and foreign-exchange firms.|$|E

60|$|For eight {{long years}} he had {{struggled}} and labored; changing his occupation several times, but always living in the city; always making his home in a boardinghouse or a hotel. His pluck and energy had had its reward, {{and for the past}} three {{years he had}} held a responsible and well-paid position in a mercantile house. But his life and his work had for him nothing but a passing interest; he had no sympathy with <b>bonded</b> <b>warehouses,</b> invoices, and ledgers. All he could look forward to was a higher position, a larger salary, and, when Miriam should graduate, a little home somewhere where she could keep house for him. In his dreams of this home, he would sometimes place it in the suburbs, where Sundays and holidays spent in country air would compensate for hasty breakfasts, early morning trains, and late ones in the afternoon. But when he reflected that it would not do to leave his young sister alone all day in a thinly settled, rural place, at the mercy of tramps, he was forced to the conclusion that the thing for them to do was to live in a city apartment. But there was nothing in either of these outlooks to create fervent longings in the soul of Ralph Haverley.|$|E

50|$|By way of illustration, by 1800 around 1,775 vessels had to moor in a {{space with}} {{capacity}} for only 545. The legal quays had not added any more frontage since 1666 and warehouse space was very limited. Congestion and delays were constant and chronic, with most vessels forced to unload while moored in the river rather than being able to moor alongside a quay. The long delays and lack of security led to widespread problems with theft and pilferage. The issue was eventually addressed {{with the construction of}} enclosed docks to the east of the City, notably on the Isle of Dogs and in Wapping, Blackwall and Rotherhithe, each with their own Legal Quays and secure <b>bonded</b> <b>warehouses.</b> The Customs Consolidation Act 1853 allowed Legal Quays and <b>bonded</b> <b>warehouses</b> to be built outside the docks, and by 1866, nearly 120 riverside wharves had obtained these privileges.|$|E
