500|$|Arthur W. Page is {{sometimes}} {{considered to be}} the father of [...] "corporate public relations" [...] for his work with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT) from 1927 to 1946. The company was experiencing resistance from the public to its monopolization efforts. In the early 1900s, AT had assessed that 90 percent of its press coverage was negative, which was reduced to 60 percent by changing its business practices and disseminating information to the press. According to <b>business</b> <b>historian</b> John Brooks, Page positioned the company as a public utility and increased the public's appreciation for the its contributions to society. Stuart Ewen said AT used its advertising dollars with newspapers to manipulate its coverage and had their PR team write feature stories that were published as if they were written by independent journalists.|$|E
500|$|Looking to {{forestall}} the impending legal imbroglio in early 1954, Hughes {{offered to buy}} out all of RKO's other stockholders. Convinced that the studio was sinking, Walt Disney ended his arrangement with RKO and set up his own distribution firm, Buena Vista Pictures. Virtual, but not quite actual. Floyd Odlum reemerged to block Hughes from acquiring the 95% ownership of RKO stock he needed to write off the company's losses against his earnings elsewhere. Hughes had reneged on his promise to give Odlum first option on buying the RKO theater chain when he divested it and was now paying the price. With negotiations between the two at a stalemate, in July 1955, Hughes turned around and sold RKO pictures to the General Tire and Rubber Company for $25 million. For Hughes, this was the effective end of a quarter-century's involvement in the movie <b>business.</b> <b>Historian</b> Betty Lasky describes Hughes's relationship with RKO as a [...] "systematic seven-year rape." ...|$|E

Petroleum <b>business</b> <b>historian</b> Daniel Yergin wrote of the period: [...] "In 1948, the canal abruptly lost its traditional rationale. ... control over the canal {{could no longer be}} preserved on grounds that it was critical to the defence either of India or of an empire that was being liquidated. And yet, at exactly the same moment, the canal was gaining a new role—as the highway not of empire, but of oil. ... By 1955, petroleum accounted for half of the canal's traffic, and, in turn, two thirds of Europe's oil passed through it".|$|E

50|$|Barbero (2008) {{examines}} {{the development of}} the field of Latin American business history, from the 1960s to 2007. Latin American business history developed in the 1960s, but until the 1980s it was dominated by either highly politicized debates over Latin American underdevelopment or biographies of Latin American entrepreneurs. Since the 1980s, Latin American business history has become a much more professionalized and an integrated part of Latin American academia. It is much less politicized and has moved beyond entrepreneurial biography to histories of companies and industries. However, Latin American <b>business</b> <b>historians</b> have still not devoted enough attention to agricultural enterprises or comparative histories between the many countries. Probably most importantly, Latin American <b>business</b> <b>historians</b> have to become much more versed in business history theory and methodology so as to get beyond mere summation of the region's economic past.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relevance of}} employing an oral history method and narrative interview techniques for <b>business</b> <b>historians.</b> We explore the use of oral history interviews {{as a means of}} capturing the expression of subjective experience in narrative and metaphor. We do so by analysing interviews concerning the transition of East German identities following reunification with West Germany. Self-expression emerges as critical to the vital identity work required for social integration following transformation, metaphor providing a means of articulating deep-rooted patterns of thought. We demonstrate that employing an oral history methodology can benefit <b>business</b> <b>historians</b> by affording access to the human dimension of a research project, unlocking the subjective understanding of experience by low-power actors among the non-hegemonic classes. Hence, employing an oral history methodology provides a valuable means of countering narrative imperialism, exemplified here by the dominant West German success story grounded in Western-style individual freedom...|$|R
