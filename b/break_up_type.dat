40|$|Summary. Sixteen provinces {{have been}} {{analysed}} from the anthropological point of view; nearly all are relative biological unities; Fisher's total X² helped us greatly {{to establish the}} similarities. On the whole the described characteristics {{are the same as}} those described by Vallois and Chamla. However the adding of new anthropological traits introduces a <b>breaking</b> <b>up</b> of the <b>types,</b> because generalised distances are often very high insed a same region. Therefore it seems necessary to subdivise these great regions into more restricted geographical areas (« anthropological districts »). No clear-cut gradient has been found.

40|$|As a Journalism major, I {{wanted to}} {{complete}} a thesis that would include all of the components that make up my curriculum [...] writing, editing and designing. I {{had gone to the}} International House in January, 1991, to interview Director of Foreign Student Programs Kirk Robey for an Orient yearbook story I was doing on international students with on-campus jobs. He gave me copies of their newsletter to help me with my research. The newsletter was done on an IBM computer monthly by the two graduate assistants in their spare time. It had no name, but was simply titled "Ball State University International Student Newsletter. " This was in large, bold ITC Bookman type with the month and year in the same style under it. It had two three-inch columns, with a. 75 -inch margin on the left, a 1. 25 margin on the right and fluctuating top and bottom margins. The body typeface was nine-point ITC Bookman and the stories had short, bold, l 1 -point titles of the same font. Some issues used clip-art to take <b>up</b> space and <b>break</b> <b>up</b> the <b>type,</b> and every issue had the "Benny-in-a-globe" {{to the right of the}} newsletter title. It was simple and suited its purpose, but in my opinion, it was not very appealing. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R
60|$|I {{found it}} very hard to make the purchasers {{understand}} that I had reasonable ground for objection to the process. What was it to me? How could it injure me if they stretched my pages by means of lead and margin into double the number I had intended. I have heard the same argument on other occasions. When I have pointed out that in this way the public would have to suffer, seeing {{that they would have to}} pay Mudie for the use of two volumes in reading that which ought to have been given to them in one, I have been assured that the public are pleased with literary short measure, that it is the object of novel-readers to get through novels as fast as they can, and that the shorter each volume is the better! Even this, however, did not overcome me, and I stood to my guns. Sir Harry was published in one volume, containing something over the normal 300 pages, with an average of 220 words to a page,--which I had settled with my conscience to be the proper length of a novel volume. I may here mention that on one occasion, and one occasion only, a publisher got the better of me in a matter of volumes. He had a two-volume novel of mine running through a certain magazine, and had it printed complete in three volumes before I knew where I was,--before I had seen a sheet of the letterpress. I stormed for a while, but I had not the heart to make him <b>break</b> <b>up</b> the <b>type.</b>|$|R

40|$|Orbital debris {{tracked by}} the US Space Command is mostly in near {{circular}} {{orbit around the}} Earth. If small debris {{were in the same}} types of orbits, there would be very few orbital debris impacts on the Long Duration Exposure Facility's (LDEF's) trailing surfaces. However, at least 15 percent of the impacts found on the trailing A 03 gold surface was found to be orbital debris impacts. This measurement suggests that the orbital distribution of small debris {{is not the same as}} that of larger debris. Although this is not a total surprise, since modelling of satellite breakups has predicted different distributions, it does raise questions as to what types of orbits could be responsible for these impacts. A model was developed to explain these LDEF results. The model calculates the expected debris impact crater distribution around LDEF, as a function of debris orbital parameters. The results show that only low inclination and highly elliptical orbits could be responsible for these impacts. The most common object left in this type of orbit is an orbital transfer stage, used by the US and ESA to place objects into geosynchronous orbit, and inclinations near 28 and 7 degrees for the US and ESA, respectively. Even large fragments from satellites, which <b>break</b> <b>up</b> in these <b>types</b> of orbits, are difficult to observe from the ground; consequently, little is known about the number and characteristics of breakups in these orbits. The LDEF data suggest that these objects are <b>breaking</b> <b>up.</b> The LDEF data also suggest that the ratio of the contribution of small debris from this type of orbit to the contribution from circular orbits is about an order of magnitude larger than the same ratio for debris tracked by the US Space Command...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{diagnostic}} efficacy of Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology in differentiating neoplastic and non-neoplastic dysfunctional ovarian cysts- cytological findings {{to be verified}} with histology of excised cyst. Methods: In this prospective study fifty-three cases with unilocular nonseptate ovarian cystic masses,detected on ultrasound examination were subjected to ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration of the cyst contents at Department of Pathology, Allama Iqbal Medical College Lahore, from January 1999 - January 2000. Aspirated fluid was examined cytologicaly using Giemsa stain on the smears prepared from centrifuged deposit. The same cyst removed surgically was examined histologicaly and cytohistological correlation was carried out. Results: In this series of 53 cases, histologically confirmed <b>break</b> <b>up</b> of various <b>types</b> of cysts was follicular cysts (n= 25), leuteal cysts (n= 6), serous cysts (n= 15), mucous cysts (N= 4) and Endometriotic cysts (n= 3). Non-diagnostic fine needle aspirate was obtained in 19 / 53 cases, majority being the follicular cysts. The cytohistolog-ical correlation revealed no false positive but 40 % false negative results for follicular cysts on cytological exam-ination of the aspirate. Hence the specificity and sensitivity for cytological diagnosis of follicular cyst was 100 % and 60 % respectively. For leuteal cysts, false positive and false negative results on cytological exam-ination were 0 % and 16. 6 % respectively with a specificity and sensitivity value of 100 % and 83 % respec...|$|R
