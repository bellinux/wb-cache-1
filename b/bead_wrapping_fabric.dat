5000|$|Bacterial Filtration Efficiency or BFE is a {{measurement}} of a material's resistance to penetration of bacteria. Results are reported as percent efficiency and correlate {{with the ability}} of the fabric to resist bacterial penetration.

50|$|CFRP {{can also}} be applied to enhance shear {{strength}} of reinforced concrete by <b>wrapping</b> <b>fabrics</b> or fibers around the section to be strengthened. Wrapping around sections (such as bridge or building columns) can also enhance the ductility of the section, greatly increasing the resistance to collapse under earthquake loading. Such 'seismic retrofit' is the major application in earthquake-prone areas, since {{it is much more}} economic than alternative methods.|$|R

50|$|The fibers {{are used}} alone or blended with {{other types of}} fiber to make twine and rope. Jute butts, the coarse ends of the plants, are used to make {{inexpensive}} cloth. Conversely, very fine threads of jute can be separated out and made into imitation silk. As jute fibers are also being used to make pulp and paper, and with increasing concern over forest destruction for the wood pulp used to make most paper, the importance of jute for this purpose may increase. Jute {{has a long history of}} use in the sackings, carpets, <b>wrapping</b> <b>fabrics</b> (cotton bale), and construction fabric manufacturing industry.|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{mechanical}} properties of a hybrid metal foam/biocomposite component useful for industrial applications like, e. g., security {{systems in the}} automotive field. Cylindrical samples were fabricated by manually <b>wrapping</b> <b>fabrics</b> of hemp fibers, impregnated with epoxy resin, around aluminum foam cylinders. Successively, the mechanical properties of the hybrid structures and of the single constituents (foam cylinders and bio-composite tubes) were determined by means of quasi-static compression and bending tests. The experimental campaign highlights that the hybrid samples show a very significant improvement of the properties, compared to {{the sum of the}} single constituents, due to the synergistic interaction between the core and the skin. Finally, a FEM model of the samples was validated by means of a numerical/experimental comparison {{of the results of the}} mechanical tests...|$|R

50|$|To {{achieve a}} better {{pressure}} resistance, hoses can be reinforced with fibers or a steel cord. Commonly used reinforcement methods are braiding, spiraling, knitting and <b>wrapping</b> of <b>fabric</b> plies. The reinforcement increases the pressure resistance {{but also the}} stiffness. To obtain flexibility, corrugations or bellows are used. Usually, circumferential or helical reinforcement rings are applied to maintain these corrugated or bellowed structures under internal pressure.|$|R

40|$|Carbon FRP has {{recently}} {{being used as}} strengthening elements of reinforced concrete elements such as beams. Two sets of experiments was carried out to study the behaviour beams strengthened with FRP <b>fabric</b> <b>wrap</b> and beams strengthened with FRP plates. The first set consists of 3 beams; a control beam, a beam reinforced with FRP plates, and a pre-cracked beam reinforced with FRP plates. Observations were made on the ultimate load capacity, load-deflection behaviour, crack pattern and propagation of tested beams. Ultimate load capacity of strengthened beams {{increased by more than}} 20 % when compared to control beam. Strengthened beams also exhibited improved load-deflection behaviour and crack pattern and propagation behaviour. The behaviour of the pre-cracked beam was almost the same as the uncracked beam. The second set of 3 beams was designed with no shear reinforcement so that the beams would fail in shear. Two of the beams were <b>wrapped</b> with FRP <b>fabric</b> <b>wrap</b> while one acts as control. One of the wrapped beams was wrapped with one layer 90 o to the horizontal while the other was wrapped with two layers; one at 45 o and the other at â€“ 45 o to the horizontal. Load carrying capacity and load-deflection behaviour of all beams tested were observed. From the results of the experiments {{it can be seen that}} the load carrying capacity of the strengthened beams wrapped at 90 o to the horizontal almost doubled when compared while the other wrapped beam more than double its load carrying capacity. From the experiments, it is shown that both FRP plates and <b>fabric</b> <b>wrap</b> strengthened beams that were misdesigned or damaged which should encourage their use it the repair of structural elements amongst practitioners...|$|R
