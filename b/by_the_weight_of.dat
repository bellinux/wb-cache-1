5|$|According to the {{official}} armament plan Kronan was to be equipped with 124–126guns; 34–36guns {{on each of the}} gundecks and an additional 18 shared between forecastle and sterncastle decks. Guns were classed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the cannonballs they fired, varying between 3 and 36pounds (1.3–15.3kg). The guns themselves weighed from a few hundred kg (400–500lbs) up to four tonnes (4.4 tons) with the heaviest pieces placed {{in the middle of the}} lower-most gundeck with successively lighter ones on the decks above. Kronans most lethal weapons were the 30- and 36-pounders on the lowest gundeck which had a range and firepower that outclassed the armament of almost any other warship. The guns lighter than 18-pounders were primarily intended to inflict damage on the enemy's crew and rigging rather than the hull.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{tangible}} goods, people, techniques, information, {{and ideas}} moved lucidly across the Eurasian landmass {{for the first}} time. For example, John of Montecorvino, archbishop of Beijing founded Roman Catholic missions in India and China and also translated the New Testament into the Mongolian language. Long-distance trade brought new methods of doing business from the far East to Europe; bills of exchange, deposit banking, and insurance were introduced to Europe during the Pax Mongolica. Bills of exchange made it significantly easier to travel long distances because a traveller would not be burdened <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> metal coins.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus {{suggests}} that the Allied ships were heavier and, by implication, less maneuverable. Their weight would further {{reduce the likelihood of}} the Allied ships employing the diekplous. The source of this heaviness is uncertain; possibly the Allied ships were bulkier in construction. Another suggestion is that the heaviness was caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> fully armoured hoplite marines. The Allies may have had extra marines on board if their ships were less maneuverable, since boarding would then be the main tactic available to them (at the cost of making the ships even heavier). Indeed, Herodotus refers to the Greeks capturing ships, rather than sinking them.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Using {{algebraic}} and geometric methods, functional {{relationships between}} {{a point on}} a conic segment and its corresponding parameter are derived when the conic segment is presented by a rational quadratic or cubic Bézier curve. That is, the inverse mappings of <b>the</b> mappings represented <b>by</b> <b>the</b> expressions of rational conic segments are given. These formulae relate some triangular areas or some angles, determined <b>by</b> <b>the</b> selected point on the curve and the control points of the curve, as well as <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>weights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rational Bézier curve. Also, the relationship can be expressed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> corresponding parametric angles of the selected point and two endpoints on the conic segment, as well as <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>weights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rational Bézier curve. These results are greatly useful for optimal parametrization, reparametrization, etc., of rational Bézier curves and surfaces...|$|R
5|$|In Petrified Forest National Park, most of {{the logs}} in the park {{retained}} their original external form during petrification but lost their internal structure. However, {{a small fraction of}} the logs and {{most of the}} park’s petrified animal bones have cells and other spaces that are mineral-filled but still retain much of their original organic structure. With these permineralized fossils, it is possible to study the cellular make-up of the original organisms with the aid of a microscope. Other organic matter—typically leaves, seeds, cones, pollen grains, spores, small stems, and fish, insect, and animal remains—have been preserved in the park as compression fossils, flattened <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the sediments above until only a thin film remains in the rock.|$|E
5|$|Next in the line, to the north, was Quinn's Post, {{defended by}} the 15th Battalion and the 2nd Light Horse Regiment. For {{some time after}} the start of the Turkish attack, the Turks {{opposite}} Quinn's just threw hand grenades at the post. Around 03:30 the Turks' machine-guns and rifles opened fire at the Australians. This lasted for about an hour when the Turks went over the top and assaulted the post. As elsewhere, they were stopped <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the Australian fire, not only from the trench they were attacking, but also by the defenders at Pope's and from the 2nd New Zealand Artillery Battery. Three more Turkish attacks were also repulsed in a similar fashion.|$|E
5|$|Sandusky {{included}} features {{designed by}} Thomas Rogers {{that had not}} been seen in locomotive construction to date. It was also the first locomotive to use cast iron driving wheels, and the wheels included built-in counterweights {{to reduce the amount of}} wear on the track caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the driving rod and wheel all coming down at once during the wheels' rotations. Before Sanduskys construction, driving wheels were typically built with wooden spokes, much like wagon wheels. Some accounts also state that Sandusky was the first locomotive to feature a whistle, but this has since been proven false.|$|E

5|$|The pillars {{that support}} {{the roof of the}} mantapa are {{monolithic}} shafts from the base up to the neck of the capital. Therefore, the height of the mantapa and the overall size of the temple were limited by the length of the stone shafts that the architects were able to obtain from the quarries. The height of the temple was also constrained <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the superstructure on the walls and, since Chalukyan architects did not use mortar, by the use of dry masonry and bonding stones without clamps or cementing material.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{extensive}} historiographical {{debate over the}} comparative strengths of the fleets, although they were ostensibly evenly matched in size, each containing 13 ships of the line. However, the loss of Culloden, the relative sizes of Orient and Leander and the participation in the action {{by two of the}} French frigates and several smaller vessels, as well as the theoretical strength of the French position, leads most historians {{to the conclusion that the}} French were marginally more powerful. This is accentuated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> broadside of several of the French ships: Spartiate, Franklin, Orient, Tonnant and Guillaume Tell were each significantly larger than any individual British ship in the battle. However inadequate deployment, reduced crews, and the failure of the rear division under Villeneuve to meaningfully participate, all contributed to the French defeat.|$|E
5|$|Players {{can only}} carry {{a limited number}} of weapons since the {{inventory}} features a 4-slot system in which single hand held pistols usually take a weapon slot whereas heavy weapons like sniper rifles or rocket launchers can take up to three weapon slots. The player's movement speed is also altered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the weapon the player is currently holding. Besides the primary function, all of the weapons in Perfect Dark Zero have one or two additional function modes that generally grant the player with special abilities. For example, the Shockwave Rifle features an X-ray function which allows the player to see enemies through walls, while the Plasma Rifle has a cloak function that renders the player character invisible to enemies at cost of its batteries. Some weapons also feature more unorthodox secondary functions. For instance, the Laptop Gun can be deployed as a sentry gun, while the SuperDragon assault rifle can launch bouncing grenades.|$|E

5|$|With Central Europe {{now under}} the Empire's dominance, Barbarossa turns his {{attention}} to Italy, namely Milan and the Pope.

Once again, Henry the Lion betrays Barbarossa, only this time he is stripped of his titles and forced into exile whilst Barbarossa is able to ascertain his superiority in Italy. The Third Crusade begins in the Middle East, and Barbarossa pledges his Empire's support to the coming campaign. But the Holy Roman Empire's army is far too strong for any Navy to carry, forcing Barbarossa to march his troops through hostile Constantinople and Anatolia, which is crawling with Seljuk Turks.
