40|$|Abstract. From the {{viewpoint}} of effective utilization of industrial wastes and reduction of CO 2 emission, the use of concrete mixed with <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> slag and fly ash has been promoted. However, the durability of fly ash concrete using <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> slag <b>cement</b> has not been clarified enough. About chloride attack, the resistance against the penetration of chloride ions could be improved due to the dense pore structure formed by the synegetic effect of mixing both ground granulated blast-furnace slag and fly ash into concrete. In this study, resistance performance of concrete using both <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> slag <b>cement</b> and fly ash against chloride attack and carbonation was experimentally investigated. The relationship between such resistance performance and pore structure of the concrete was also examined. As a result, the combination of <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> slag <b>cement</b> and fly ash type II resulted in the decrease of pore volume over 50 nm in the diameter and reduction of the apparent diffusion coefficient of chloride ion, but the resistance performance against carbonation of the concrete was lower than {{the case of the}} normal fly ash concrete. 1...|$|R

40|$|A simple {{nondestructive}} {{technique was}} used as an alternative method to monitor the hardening of cement-treated clay as a function of time. The principle of this monitoring technique is based on the use of bender elements to measure the small-strain shear modulus (G 0) at various time intervals. The strength increase was monitored by conventional unconfined compression testing. Experimental work was carried out on Kaolin clay treated with Portland <b>cement</b> and <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> slag <b>cement</b> at different dosages. The results showed that G 0, as well as strength, of cementtreated samples increases logarithmically with time. However, <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> slag <b>cement</b> produces a slower hardening rate early after mixing.

40|$|A Portland fly ash cement {{containing}} 20 % {{of a fine}} fly ash and a <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> slag <b>cement</b> {{of approximately}} 290 days old were examined with analytical transmission electron microscopy, {{in order to examine}} the (local) microstructure in these cements in detail. In the Portland fly ash cement the fly ash reacted with CH resulting from the cement hydration. Due to this pozzolanic reaction, initially a dense C-S-H reaction rim precipitates around the fly ash glass spheres. In course of time, a radially fibrillar and more porous zone of C-S-H is formed in between the dense C-S-H zone and the fly ash surface. The dense C-S-H notably contains aluminium and potassium, elements which are likely to originate from the fly ash. The microstructure of the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> slag <b>cement</b> is also marked by a local chemical differentiation; a zoned structure is formed surrounding the original slag grain. Chemical analyses and element maps indicate that notably Si and Ca, and also some of the AI, is transported out of the slag grain interior. The driving force for this element transport is accounted for by a postulated gel-layer, creating a chemical potential gradient for water. Hydrophillic elements, such as Si and Ca will migrate out of the slag, and will cause a gradual paste densification, responsible for the low permeability in <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> slag <b>cements.</b> Within the gel-layer, a water poor region is formed in which a hydrotalcite-like phase precipitates, possibly together with minor amounts of C-S-H like material at its inner edge.

It was found that the two parameters, TAL and Delta(tol), are appropriate for both assessing the alkali-reactivity of aggregates (TAL) and comparing the efficacy of blended cements as ASR inhibitors (Delta(tol)).

40|$|In CUR-Recommendation 38, various vital {{measures}} {{that need to}} be taken during design of new concrete-mixtures in order to prevent damage due to ASR in the concrete have been outlined.

40|$|Durability of {{concrete}} structures in marine environments {{has become a}} major concern to the scientific community over the past several decades. Many publications have reported the excellent performance {{of concrete}} containing mineral admixtures (MAs), such as ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) and pulverized fuel ash (PFA), in coastal marine environments. However, the rate of hydration or pozzolanic activity of MAs in the concrete is slow. As a result, the resistance offered to the penetration of chloride ions also increases slowly with time. This paper reports the results of an experimental study conducted to evaluate the effect of curing conditions on the strength, porosity, and chloride ingress characteristics of concretes made with high slag <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>cement</b> (HBFC) and ordinary Portland cement (OPC). A total of six different concrete mixtures were cast and tested. The experimental variables included water-to-binder ratio (W/B) ratios, curing environments, and curing durations. W/B ratios used were 0. 33, 0. 34, and 0. 36. Two types of curing conditions are investigated: seawater immersion and marine atmospheric exposure during curing at 4, 7, 28, 90, 180, and 360 day intervals. The results indicated that the curing condition had pronounced effects on the related properties. Seawater-cured specimens showed a slightly higher early strength but a lower ultimate strength as compared with air-cured specimens. The HBFC concretes had lower MIP porosity than the corresponding OPC concretes with the same design strength. The chloride diffusion coefficient of the HBFC concretes was much lower than that of the corresponding OPC concretes. Therefore, it may be concluded that the HBFC concretes showed considerably better resistance to chlorides ion penetration than the OPC concretes...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of this}} {{research}} project, a test stretch with a sub-base with a hydraulic binder of sand (hydraulically bound sand sub-base) was set up. The project aimed to observe the filling behaviour of the base {{as well as its}} characteristics after it had been laid compared to a hydraulically bound gravel base in accordance with ZTVT. The grading curve of the chosen sand lay within grading envelope 'A' as designated by the supplement for hydraulically bound sand sub-base. A <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>cement</b> HOZ 35 L was used as a binder. In particular, extended suitability tests were used to investigate the strengths, frost resistance and initial stability of the mixed materials. The material mixture for hydraulically bound sand sub-base requires a higher binder content compared with that for hydraulically bound gravel base, though from a technical point of view, a material can be produced which meets ZTVT requirements. When the hydraulically bound sand sub-base was laid it became clear that compaction with the heavy-duty screed of a road finishing machine at a thickness of 15 cm was generally sufficient to achieve the specified rate of compaction. Owing to different weather conditions during the construction of the test stretch, there were two qualitatively different areas in the hydraulically bound sand sub-base section. The control test section with hydraulically bound gravel base served as a further comparison to these two sections. In light of the deflection measurement results {{on the surface of the}} hydraulically bound base, the hydraulically bound sand sub-base sections show slightly less favourable characteristics. Whether or not this has any effect on long-term behaviour remains to be seen. With a view to the course bonding between the hydraulically bound base and the asphalt road base, a bond could in no way be determined from the material taken from the drilling core. With the help of surveys carried out by the 'Bundesanstalt fuer Strassenwesen' (Federal Highway research Institute) over a longer period of time, during which the deflections as well as the transverse and longitudinal profiles will be measured, the continued behaviour of the test stretch under traffic conditions is to be evaluated.
