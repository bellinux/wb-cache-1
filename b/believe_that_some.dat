5|$|Following the battle, Santa Anna was {{alternately}} {{viewed as}} a national hero or a pariah. Mexican perceptions of the battle often mirrored the prevailing viewpoint. Santa Anna had been disgraced following his capture at the Battle of San Jacinto, and many Mexican accounts of the battle were written by men who had been, or had become, his outspoken critics. Petite and many other historians <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of the stories, such as the execution of Crockett, may have been invented to further discredit Santa Anna. In Mexican history, the Texas campaign, including the Battle of the Alamo, was soon overshadowed by the Mexican–American War of 1846–48.|$|E

25|$|A few sociologists {{studying}} TCKs, however, {{argue that}} the commonality found in international TCKs is {{not the result of}} true commonality, but rather the researcher's bias projecting expectations upon the studied subculture.

The exteriors may be the same, but that the understanding of the world around them differs.|$|E
25|$|Some {{critics say}} that breast cancer {{awareness}} has transformed the disease into a market-driven industry of survivorship and corporate sales pitches. Corporate marketing machines promote early detection of breast cancer, while also opposing public health efforts, such as stricter environmental legislation, that might decrease the incidence rate of breast cancer. These critics <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of the breast cancer organizations, particularly the highly visible Susan G. Komen for the Cure, have become captive companies that support and provide social capital to the breast cancer industry, including pharmaceutical companies, mammography equipment manufacturers, and pollution-causing industries, as well as large corporations, creating or exacerbating other problems.|$|E

25|$|Other {{researchers}} <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> individual(s) {{may have}} been behind its origins, being followed by imitators later on. Spring-heeled Jack was widely considered {{not to be a}} supernatural creature, but rather one or more persons with a macabre sense of humour. This idea matches the contents of the letter to the Lord Mayor, which accused a group of young aristocrats as the culprits, after an irresponsible wager. A popular rumour circulating as early as 1840 pointed to an Irish nobleman, the Marquess of Waterford, as the main suspect. Haining suggested this {{may have been}} due to him having previously had bad experiences with women and police officers.|$|E
25|$|Eleven saboteurs, {{disguised}} {{in military}} uniforms, penetrated the security fence and infiltrated the A-7 parking ramp {{through a hole}} cut in the perimeter chain link fence. Investigators <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>some,</b> if not all, arrived near the ramp in a boat surreptitiously guided along a nearby channel. The operation occurred during USAF security police (SP) shift changeover. Security was provided by both contracted civilian guards and operations and maintenance-funded, uniformed military, full-time and part-time Air National Guard Security Policemen. The perpetrators exited using the reverse of their entry method. Choosing to strike at shift change indicates the possibility of prior surveillance or insider information. The commandos placed approximately 25 explosive devices on the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} mechanisms underlying myoclonus are not {{yet fully}} understood. Scientists <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> types of stimulus-sensitive myoclonus may involve overexcitability of {{the parts of the}} brain that control movement. These parts are interconnected in a series of feedback loops called motor pathways. These pathways facilitate and modulate communication between the brain and muscles. Key elements of this communication are chemicals known as neurotransmitters, which carry messages from one nerve cell, or neuron, to another. Neurotransmitters are released by neurons and attach themselves to receptors on parts of neighboring cells. Some neurotransmitters may make the receiving cell more sensitive, while others tend to make the receiving cell less sensitive. Laboratory studies suggest that an imbalance between these chemicals may underlie myoclonus.|$|E

25|$|There are {{questions}} or uncertainties {{as to how}} the Chu Ci came to be collected into its present form; however, at least some outlines of this historical process have been presented in scholarly literature. Another important aspect of Chu Ci studies is the editorial history. One regard is the order in which the various titles appear. There are also reasons to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of the sections (juan) were subject to editing for various reasons, including to suit the verses to theatrical performance and {{due to the nature of}} the textual process of ancient China, involving writing lines of text on individual bamboo strips which were bound together, but when the bindings broke were subject to editorial decisions as to what their original order was.|$|E
25|$|Most {{of these}} {{perceptions}} arise from Wagner's published opinions {{on a number}} of topics. Wagner was a voluminous writer and published essays and pamphlets {{on a wide range of}} subjects throughout his life. Wagner's writing style is verbose, unclear and turgid, which has greatly added to the confusion about his opinions. Several of his writings have achieved some notoriety, in particular his essay Das Judenthum in der Musik, (Jewishness in Music), a critical view on the influence of Jews in German culture and society at that time. The essays he wrote in his final years were also controversial, with many readers perceiving them to employ an endorsement of racist beliefs. Some commentators also <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of Wagner's operas contain adverse caricatures of Jews.|$|E

Although he never was a fearful man, after the fourth strike he began to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> force was trying to destroy him and he {{acquired}} a fear of death.

Regardless of what Swift {{may or may not be}} planning, he wrote to Motte in December 1732 and said: [...] "I have cause to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> of our printers will collected all they think to be mine, and print them by subscription, which I will never encourage nor oppose." ...|$|E
