40|$|Rapid {{growth in}} finding new {{applications}} for manufactured nanomaterials (MNM) {{has recently been}} accompanied by awareness about their related adverse toxicological and environmental impacts. Due to their intrinsic nature, measuring available concentrations of MNMs in the environment is a major challenge. This research is a launching point toward filling this gap, as it presents {{the potential of the}} well-established diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) technique to determine MNMs concentrations in situ. Two <b>binding</b> <b>layers</b> commonly used in DGT devices were shown to be able to bind ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO NPs). The use of different types of diffusive layers demonstrated the critical role of their pore size for selective function of the DGT devices. The ZnO NPs can pass through the open pore diffusive layer used in standard DGT devices and be retained by the <b>binding</b> resin <b>layer.</b> However, the diffusion of ZnO NPs can be prevented when a 1000 MWCO (molecular weight cut off) dialysis membrane is placed {{in the front of the}} diffusive gel layer. A combination of two or more DGT devices with known diffusive layer properties should enable deduction of concentrations of available ZnO NPs in the environment. Unlike metal ions, determining diffusion coefficient values for ZnO NPs is challenging and greatly affected by shape, morphology, and solution-induced changes of the particles. Attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) demonstrated that retention of ZnO NPs by Chelex and Metsorb <b>binding</b> <b>layers</b> occurs through chemisorption. The superior uptake kinetic for Chelex indicates that it is a better candidate for further development of DGT devices to measure ZnO NPs. These initial results are promising and important for further developing the DGT technique to measure available concentrations of manufactured nanomaterials in the different environmental media (waters, soils, and sediments). Further experiments investigating the effects of pH, ionic strength, and solution chemistry on the performance of DGT for measuring MNM concentrations are needed...|$|R

Sometimes this is achieved by chemistry, as in the case of aluminium primer, but more often this is achieved through controlling the primer's physical properties, such as porosity, tackiness, and hygroscopy. In practice primer is often used when painting many kinds of porous materials, such as concrete and especially wood (see detailed description below). Priming is mandatory if the material is not water resistant and will be exposed to the elements. Priming gypsum board (drywall) is also standard practice with new construction because it seals the wall and aids in preventing mold.

The importance of the polymeric layer in analyzing data is controversial. The question {{of the effect of}} a <b>binding</b> <b>layer</b> also arises in the case of ligands interacting with binding sites distributed in the extracellular matrix of cells. To identify and quantify the effects of a <b>binding</b> <b>layer</b> on the estimation of association and dissociation rate constants, we derived effective rate coefficients. The expressions show that rate constants determined under the standard assumption that binding takes place on a two-dimensional surface underestimate the true reaction rate constants by a factor that depends on the ratio of the height of the layer to the mean free path of the ligand within the layer. We show that, for typical biological ligands, receptors, cells, and Biacore conditions, the <b>binding</b> <b>layer</b> will affect the interpretation of data only if transport of the ligand in the layer is slowed substantially—by one or two orders of magnitude—relative to transport outside the layer. From existing experiments and theory, it is not clear which Biacore experiments, if any, have transport within the dextran layer reduced to such an extent.

Limiting uncertainty requires the use of optimized procedures and suitable elution recoveries (fe). This work therefore investigated elution robustness to propose improved strategies. A wide range of conditions were investigated for the main elution parameters (Chelex® particle size, elution time, Chelex® loading, and eluent concentration and volume) on Al(III), Cd(II), Co(II), Cr(III), Cu(II), Ni(II), Pb(II), and Zn(II). Results showed that the choice of elution conditions should be a compromise driven by study constrains in terms of accuracy, repeatability, sensitivity, and targeted elements. Using experimentally determined recoveries should improve accuracy by approximately 5 to 10 % compared to the use of recoveries from the literature. Fast elution of 1 h can be achieved without significant loss of recovery and repeatability except for Cr(III) (8 h minimum). Elution recovery depended on Chelex® loading for Zn and Cr and introducing recoveries adapted to the loading could improve accuracy up to, respectively, 11 and 27 %. When standard recoveries are used, a 0. 85 fe value would be more appropriate than the common value of 0. 8 to minimize inaccuracy (except for Cr). Some flexibility can be applied to elution conditions without a significant change in recovery for most elements: HNO 3 concentration of 1 – 15 M, volume of 1 – 2 mL, duration of 8 – 48 h. Cr(III) was unique in its sensitivity to elution condition variations; thus, choice is more restricted for this element...|$|R

High uptake and elution efficiencies were determined for a mixed (PrCH/A 520 E) binding gel for dissolved inorganic nitrogen and an agarose-based Metsorb <b>binding</b> <b>layer</b> for PO 4 -P. Diffusion coefficients (D) obtained from DGT time-series experiments (conductivity 180 μS cm− 1) for NH 4 -N, NO 3 -N and PO 4 -P agreed well with those measured using individual DGT techniques in previous studies, but were characterised over {{a wider range}} of ionic strengths here. D for NO 3 -N and PO 4 -P were constant over a range of ionic strengths (between 100 and 800 μS cm− 1) while the diffusion coefficient for NH 4 -N decreased with increasing ionic strength, as reported previously. The measurement of NH 4 -N, NO 3 -N and PO 4 -P using the INP-DGT was independent of pH (3. 5 – 8. 5) and quantitative over varying ionic strength ranges (up to 0. 004 mol L− 1 NaCl for NH 4 -N, up to 0. 014 mol L− 1 NaCl for NO 3 -N and over 0. 1 mol L− 1 NaCl for PO 4 -P) for a 24 h deployment time. Performance of INP-DGT in synthetic freshwaters with differing conductivity indicated the three nutrients were affected differently, with NH 4 -N measurements being most sensitive. Representative performance was determined for NO 3 -N (90 – 330 μS cm− 1) and PO 4 -P (all tested conductivities) over a 72 h deployment period and for NH 4 -N (< 330 μS cm− 1) over a 24 h deployment period. Field validations showed that the ratios of INP-DGT concentrations to the average concentrations from grab samples were generally between 0. 80 and 1. 13 over 24 and 48 h deployment periods. To ensure the representative performance of INP-DGT for all three nutrients, the conductivity should not exceed 400 μS cm− 1 and deployment times should be no longer than 24 h. The results of this study have demonstrated that INP-DGT could provide a cost-effective monitoring technique for measuring time-weighted average concentrations of dissolved inorganic nutrients in many freshwaters.

Microlite PrCH had high uptake (> 92. 5 %) and elution efficiencies (87. 2 % using 2  mol L− 1 NaCl). Mass vs. time validation experiments over 24  h demonstrated excellent linearity (R 2  ≥  0. 996). PrCH-DGT <b>binding</b> <b>layers</b> had an extremely high intrinsic binding capacity for NH 4 –N (∼ 3000  μg). NH 4 –N uptake was quantitative over pH ranges 3. 5 – 8. 5 and ionic strength (up to 0. 012  mol L− 1 as NaCl) typical of freshwater systems. Several cations (Na+, K+, Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +) were found to compete with NH 4 –N for uptake by PrCH-DGT, but NH 4 –N uptake was quantitative over concentration ranges typical of freshwater (up to 0. 012  mol L− 1 Na+, 0. 006  mol L− 1  K+, 0. 003  mol L− 1 Ca 2 + and 0. 004  mol L− 1  Mg 2 +). Effective diffusion coefficients determined from mass vs. time experiments changed non-linearly with electrical conductivity.

Simple {{interpretation of the}} metal accumulation {{in terms of a}} solution concentration has assumed that trace metals do not penetrate beyond the surface of the <b>binding</b> <b>layer,</b> but penetration, although theoretically discussed has not yet been directly measured. Multiple binding layers were used to enable analysis of different depths of a DGT binding phase (Chelex- 100 or iminodiacetate resins). In simple metal solution (no ligand) at pH 7, metal penetration to the back layer was low and similar for all metals. However, at lower pH up to 42 % of an individual metal accumulated in the back resin layer. This was most noticeable for Mn at pH 4 and 5, but Cd and Co were also affected at pH 4. These results were consistent with rate limited binding, particularly for Mn. A kinetic model successfully fitted the data and allowed derivation of a binding rate constant and the mean distance that metals penetrate into a resin gel (λM). Only for Mn, Co and Cd were experimentally derived λM values greater than the diameter of a Chelex- 100 resin bead. For most situations, then, the penetration into the <b>binding</b> <b>layer</b> is negligible and binding of trace metal ions can be regarded as instantaneous, validating the simple use and interpretation of DGT.

All measured trace metal concentrations were well below ANZECC water quality guidelines, except for Cu which was 2 to 10 times higher than trigger values. Each of the DGT techniques was deployed using both open and restricted diffusive layers (ODL and RDL). Most trace metal measurements were not significantly different with ODL and RDL for all binding layers. However, concentrations of Cu (CRDL/CODL = 0. 68 – 0. 75) and Al (CRDL/CODL = 0. 73 – 0. 79) were significantly different with DGT-MBL, DGT-Chelex and DGT-Metsorb.

5000|$|Cyclododecane is {{also used}} as a {{volatile}} binding medium, a temporary binder for sealing and conservation of friable and structurally weak materials, e.g. during excavation and transport of archaeological objects and in art restoration, e.g. to protect water-sensitive parts during cleaning. Due to its relatively slow evaporation in comparison with other volatile <b>binding</b> mediums the <b>layer</b> can last for several weeks. Very pure material has to be used so it does not leave any residue. Cyclododecane can be applied in molten state or dissolved in a nonpolar organic solvent. Other volatile binding mediums in use are camphene, tricyclene and with some limits menthol.http://cool.conservation-us.org/byform/mailing-lists/cdl/1999/0218.html ...|$|R
40|$|Elastomeric base {{isolation}} {{systems are}} {{proven to be}} effective in reducing seismic forces transmitted to buildings. However, due to their cost, the use of these devices is currently limited to large and expensive buildings. A fiber reinforced elastomeric isolator utilizes fiber fabric, such as carbon fiber, glass fibre, and etc. as the reinforcement material instead of solid steel plates. The fibre fabric reinforcement is extensible in tension and has no flexural rigidity. Elastomers normally used in the isolator are natural rubber; neoprene, butyl rubber and nit rile rubber etc. These devices were fabricated by <b>binding</b> alternating <b>layers</b> of rubber and fibre mesh. The fibre mesh is used to increase the vertical stiffness of the bearings while maintaining low lateral stiffness. Characterizing the behaviour of a fibre reinforced bearing “shape factor ” of the bearing, Poisson’s ratio of the elastomeric material and flexibility of the reinforcing sheets and investigate the effect of reinforcement flexibility on compressive behaviour of elastomeric bearings with different geometrical and material properties. Bonding with fibre reinforcements can increase the stiffness of elastic layers only when the elastic layer is compressed...|$|R
