40|$|We {{measure the}} UV-continuum slope beta for over 4000 high-redshift galaxies {{over a wide}} range of redshifts z~ 4 - 8 and luminosities from the HST HUDF/XDF, HUDF 09 - 1, HUDF 09 - 2, ERS, CANDELS-N, and CANDELS-S data sets. Our new beta results reach very faint levels at z~ 4 (- 15. 5 mag: 0. 006 L*(z= 3)), z~ 5 (- 16. 5 mag: 0. 014 L*(z= 3)), and z~ 6 and z~ 7 (- 17 mag: 0. 025 L*(z= 3)). Inconsistencies between {{previous}} studies led us to conduct a comprehensive review of systematic errors and develop a new technique for measuring beta that is robust against biases that arise from the impact of noise. We demonstrate, by object-by-object comparisons, that all previous studies, including our own and those done on the latest HUDF 12 dataset, suffer from small systematic errors in beta. We find that after correcting for the systematic errors (typically d(beta) ~ 0. 1 - 0. 2) all beta results at z~ 7 from different groups are in excellent agreement. The mean beta we measure for faint (- 18 mag: 0. 1 L*(z= 3)) z~ 4, z~ 5, z~ 6, and z~ 7 galaxies is - 2. 03 +/- 0. 03 +/- 0. 06 (random and systematic errors), - 2. 14 +/- 0. 06 +/- 0. 06, - 2. 24 +/- 0. 11 +/- 0. 08, and - 2. 30 +/- 0. 18 +/- 0. 13, respectively. Our new beta values are redder than we have reported in the past, but bluer than other recent results. Our previously reported trend of <b>bluer</b> <b>beta's</b> at lower luminosities is confirmed, as is the evolution to <b>bluer</b> <b>beta's</b> at high redshifts. beta appears to show only a mild luminosity dependence faintward of M(UV,AB) ~ - 19 mag, suggesting that the mean beta asymptotes to ~ - 2. 2 to - 2. 4 for faint z>~ 4 galaxies. At z~ 7, the observed beta's suggest non-zero, but low dust extinction, and they agree well with values predicted in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations.

40|$|We use the ultra-deep WFC 3 /IR data {{over the}} HUDF and the Early Release Science WFC 3 /IR data over the CDF-South GOODS field to {{quantify}} the broadband spectral properties of candidate star-forming galaxies at z~ 7. We determine the UV-continuum slope beta in these galaxies, and compare the slopes with galaxies at later times to measure the evolution in beta. For luminous L*(z= 3) galaxies, we measure a mean UV-continuum slope beta of - 2. 0 +/- 0. 2, which {{is comparable to the}} beta~- 2 derived at similar luminosities at z~ 5 - 6. However, for the lower luminosity 0. 1 L*(z= 3) galaxies, we measure a mean beta of - 3. 0 +/- 0. 2. This is substantially bluer than is found for similar luminosity galaxies at z~ 4, just 800 Myr later, and even at z~ 5 - 6. In principle, the observed beta of - 3. 0 can be matched by a very young, dust-free stellar population, but when nebular emission is included the expected beta becomes >~- 2. 7. To produce these very <b>blue</b> <b>beta's</b> (i. e., beta~- 3), extremely low metallicities and mechanisms to reduce the red nebular emission are likely required. For example, a large escape fraction (i. e., f_{esc}>~ 0. 3) could minimize the contribution from this red nebular emission. If this is correct and the escape fraction in faint z~ 7 galaxies is >~ 0. 3, it may help to explain how galaxies reionize the universe.

40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate and to compare the tensile weld strengths and microstructural changes in four archwires namely beta titanium, stainless steel (SS), blue elgiloy and timolium before and after immersion in 1. 23 % acidulated phosphate fluoride (APF) solution. Materials and Methods: The mean tensile weld strength of a weld joint of four arch wires were compared pre-fluoride (Group 1) with post fluoride (Group 2) and the microstructural characteristics of weld joints were evaluated under an optical microscope. Results: The mean tensile weld strength for beta titanium was 445. 64 N/mm 2, blue elgiloy was 363. 26 N/mm 2, SS was 358. 30 N/mm 2 and timolium was 308. 62 N/mm 2. After immersion in fluoride the mean tensile strength for beta titanium was 427. 16 N/mm 2, blue elgiloy was 359. 86 N/mm 2, SS is 349. 44 N/mm 2 and timolium is 294. 86 N/mm 2. After immersion in fluoride, the beta titanium and SS had a smooth fusion at the center of weld assembly with characteristic nugget formation. The beta titanium weld assembly had greater tensile weld strength than other welded assemblies. Blue elgiloy ranked second, whereas SS and timolium were third and fourth respectively. Conclusion: The wires in descending order of their mean tensile weld strength, on evaluation of their weld joints were found to be: <b>Beta</b> titanium > <b>blue</b> elgiloy > SS > timolium. The reduction in tensile weld strength was statistically insignificant for all the archwires after exposure to 1. 23 % APF at 37 °C for 90 min...|$|R
50|$|It is a {{two-dimensional}} graphical {{representation in the}} Segrè-arrangement with the neutron number N on the abscissa and the proton number Z on the ordinate. Each nuclide is represented {{at the intersection of}} its respective neutron and proton number by a small square box with the chemical symbol and the nucleon number A. By columnar subdivision of such a field, in addition to ground states also nuclear isomers can be shown. The coloring of a field (segmented if necessary) shows in addition to the existing text entries the observed types of radioactive decay of the nuclide and a rough classification of their relative shares: stable, nonradioactive nuclides completely black, primordial radionuclides partially black, proton emission orange, alpha decay yellow, beta plus decay/electron capture red, isomeric transition (gamma decay, internal conversion) white, <b>beta</b> minus decay <b>blue,</b> spontaneous fission green, cluster emission violet, neutron emission light blue. For each radionuclide its field includes (if known) information about its half-life and essential energies of the emitted radiation, for stable nuclides and primordial radionuclides there are data on mole fraction abundances in the natural isotope mixture of the corresponding chemical element. Furthermore, for many nuclides cross sections for nuclear reactions with thermal neutrons are quoted, usually for the (n, γ)-reaction (neutron capture), partly fission cross sections for the induced nuclear fission and cross sections for the (n, α)-reaction or (n, p)-reaction. For the chemical elements cross sections and standard atomic weights (both averaged over natural isotopic composition) are specified (the relative atomic masses partially as an interval to reflect the variability of the composition of the element's natural isotope mixture). For the nuclear fission of 235U and 239Pu with thermal neutrons, percentage isobaric chain yields of fission products are listed.|$|R
40|$|We use a newly {{assembled}} {{large sample}} of 3, 545 star-forming galaxies with secure spectroscopic, grism, and photometric redshifts at z= 1. 5 - 2. 5 to constrain {{the relationship between}} UV slope (beta) and dust attenuation (L(IR) /L(UV) =IRX). Our sample benefits from the combination of deep Hubble WFC 3 /UVIS photometry from the Hubble Deep UV (HDUV) Legacy survey and existing photometric data compiled in the 3 D-HST survey, and extends the range of UV luminosity and beta probed in previous UV-selected samples. IRX is measured using stacks of deep Herschel/PACS 100 and 160 micron data, {{and the results are}} compared with predictions of the IRX-beta relation for different assumptions of the stellar population model and obscuration curve. We find that z= 1. 5 - 2. 5 galaxies have an IRX-beta relation that is consistent with the predictions for an SMC extinction curve if we invoke sub-solar metallicity models that are currently favored for high-redshift galaxies, while the commonly assumed starburst attenuation curve over-predicts the IRX at a given beta by a factor of ~ 3. The IRX of high-mass (M*> 10 ^ 9. 75 Msun) galaxies is a factor of > 4 larger than that of low-mass galaxies, lending support for the use of stellar mass as a proxy for attenuation. The commonly observed trend of fainter galaxies having <b>bluer</b> <b>beta</b> may simply reflect bluer intrinsic UV slopes for such galaxies, rather than lower obscurations. The IRX-beta for young/low-mass galaxies implies a dust curve that is steeper than the SMC, suggesting a lower attenuation at a given beta relative to older/more massive galaxies. The lower attenuations and higher ionizing photon output implied by low metallicity stellar population models point to Lyman continuum production efficiencies, xi_ion, that may be elevated by a factor of ~ 2 relative to the canonical value for L* galaxies, aiding in their ability to keep the universe ionized at z~ 2.
