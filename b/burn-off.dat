2500|$|On October 1, 2007, a four-minute long, one-day only tag commemorating Epcot's 25th Silver Anniversary {{followed}} IllumiNations: Reflections of Earth.

At {{the end of the}} regular show a male voice-over was heard saying, [...] "And now in honor of Epcot's 25th Anniversary we celebrate our history and look to the future. We've just begun to dream." [...] Once the music began, select segments of classic Epcot music were played including We've Just Begun to Dream, Tapestry of Nations and Tapestry of Dreams. After the show, the retro music loop played throughout the park that day began to play, beginning with New Horizons. Due to the extra amount of fireworks used for the special tag, it took much longer than normal to move the firework barges off of the lagoon which resulted in a <b>Burn-Off</b> after midnight.|$|E

500|$|M. inquilina is {{the only}} species in its genus to be listed as [...] "vulnerable" [...] by the IUCN Red List. This, however, needs updating. Habitat loss may be {{responsible}} for the ant to be potentially endangered; Douglas and Brown note that a contamination of dieldrin spray to control the argentine ant destroyed many nests housing M. inquilina, and <b>burn-offs</b> are also a threat to colonies housing M. inquilina.|$|R
25|$|Much of Manawatu-Wanganui was fertile and bush-covered when Europeans {{arrived and}} {{developed}} {{the area as}} a source of timber.

Deforestation, <b>burn-offs</b> of timber and scrub and large scale drainage combined with overgrazing, resulted in considerable environmental degradation. In the early 1900s authorities realised that careful management was needed to maintain this important agricultural area.|$|R

50|$|This sensor {{sometimes}} {{employs a}} mixture screw, but this screw is fully electronic {{and uses a}} variable resistor (potentiometer) instead of an air bypass screw.

50|$|The {{series was}} not well-reviewed by critics, or {{successful}} in the ratings in either Canada or the United States.

50|$|Typically every Sunday {{night during}} prime time (unless preempted, usually by sports telecasts), Fox airs a lineup {{incorporating}} original adult animation series. This block of adult cartoons became {{a staple of}} the network - airing under the brand Animation Domination from May 1, 2005, to September 14, 2014, when the network rebranded the block as Sunday Funday {{as a result of the}} re-incorporation of live-action comedy series on the Sunday night lineup after ten years (aside from occasional <b>burn-offs</b> of series aired on other nights during the 7:00 p.m. Eastern/Pacific hour), although animated series remain an integral part of that night's schedule.|$|R

50|$|Also, {{in colonial}} times, {{government}} only attempted {{to control the}} outbreak of wildfire by legislating against the careless use of fire, beginning with the 1847 ordinance against reckless <b>burn-offs</b> or stubble and grass. Fire suppression was left to local residents who would band together to fight fires as they arose without any formal organisation or authority to set backburns.

50|$|Vegetation types {{within the}} park include dry {{eucalyptus}} forest, heathland and saltwater wetlands.

50|$|The , {{also known}} as the , uses a mixture of {{refractory}} aggregate, hydrolyzed ethyl silicate, alcohol, and a gelling agent to create a mold. This slurry mixture is poured into a slightly tapered flask and a reusable pattern (i.e. the item used to create the shape of the mold) is used. The slurry hardens almost immediately to a rubbery state (the consistency of vulcanized rubber). The flask and pattern is then removed. Then a torch is used to ignite the mold, which causes most of the volatiles to <b>burn-off</b> and the formation of ceramic microcrazes (microscopic cracks). These cracks are important, because they allow gases to escape while preventing the metal from flowing through; they also ease thermal expansion and contraction during solidification and shrinkage. After the <b>burn-off,</b> the mold is baked at 1800 F to remove any remaining volatiles. Prior to pouring metal, the mold is pre-warmed to control shrinkage.|$|E
50|$|Approximately 350 years old, it {{was burned}} in April 2003, {{and died in}} December 2003, {{as the result of}} {{catching}} fire in a <b>burn-off</b> of the debris remaining after the clear-felling of old-growth forest in the tree's immediate vicinity. Australian forestry officials admitted responsibility for killing the tree. Its hollow trunk acted like a furnace so that it was cooked from the inside.|$|E
50|$|Fox had {{previously}} scheduled first-run sitcoms, the comedic video series The World's Funniest!, and animated {{series in the}} 7:00 p.m. hour during the NFL season, but these were often subjected to pre-emption (resulting in episodes being delayed by one week or more) due to overruns of late afternoon games into the hour, which impacted their ratings performance; {{as a result of}} the postgame show's expansion, the network generally delayed carriage of first-run programming during the first hour of Sunday prime time to midseason (one exception was the freshman sitcom Mulaney in 2014, which was pushed to the hour that November due to struggling ratings in its original 9:30 Eastern slot), primarily limited to <b>burn-offs</b> of already failed series.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, episodes of long-running shows {{that are no}} longer hits and have been taken off the {{schedule}} have been burned off. The Drew Carey Show {{is an example of}} a series whose entire final season was burned off (the series' ninth season aired on ABC in the summer of 2004). In many cases, instead of airing the episodes during the regular television season, the episodes are held back and presented during the summer months to fulfill the network's obligation to air them and to produce at least some return on their investment. Recent examples of summer <b>burn-offs</b> include Fox's Sons of Tucson (2010) and the NBC medical/fantasy drama Do No Harm (2013).|$|R
40|$|Chars {{obtained}} by carbonizing coconut shells at different intermediate heat treatment temperatures (IHTT) between 400 and 800 °C were activated at 800 °C {{in a stream}} of N 2 +H 2 O, following two distinct procedures.

Convicted for 5 more arsons, Lyttle was at the low-security St Heliers prison farm where he served as a captain of a NSW country bush fire brigade. When there were no fires he did fire reduction work, like <b>burn-offs.</b> The fire control officer in charge had heard rumors that he was an arsonist, but did nothing to confirm this.

He was released on parole from Silverwater jail on 12 May 2010, even though he refused to admit to the crime.|$|R
25|$|The {{region is}} one of the most {{significant}} forestry areas in the southern North Island. The predominant soil type, yellow-brown earths, when enhanced by the use of fertilisers, is very suitable for forestry. Forestry has a long history in the Manawatu since Palmerston North developed as a saw-milling town, and the region's initial prosperity depended on heavy exploitation of native timbers. But land use practices inhibited the long term viability of this indigenous forestry industry. Severe <b>burn-offs</b> destroyed large areas of native forest and subsequent overgrazing affected the soils. Forestry largely disappeared until the early twentieth century. In an attempt to combat erosion problems in sandy soils the government planted forests in the Foxton/Levin area in the early twentieth century. Inland forests were planted later. Some private native forest has been set aside for sustainable logging but most forestry depends on exotic plantings.|$|R
50|$|As semi-nomads the Gadubanud roved {{from the}} inland {{rainforest}} plateau through wetlands {{to the coast}} and its estuaries, and their diet would have varied according to the seasons. These consisted of varieties of protein-rich fish, eels, waterfowl and birds. The lacustrine and wetland zones at Gerangamete, Irrewillipe and Chappie Vale afforded reliable food resources. Nutriment was readily available by harvesting the abundant starchy tubers, of which the area has over 200 species, such as water-ribbons (Triglochin procera) and the club-rush (Scirpus maritimus) together with tall spike rush (Eleocharis sphacelata)) rhizomes. Inland they could rely on a plethora of carbohydrate food from yam daisies (or murnong yams), which were cultivated through frequent <b>burn-offs</b> to clear patches of forest. The forests also yielded bracken ferns whose pith is more nutritious than potatoes. Protein-rich food was secured by culling the native bush rats, indigenous mice, possums, snakes, lizards, frogs, birds and their eggs, eastern grey kangaroo, red-necked wallabys, brushtail possums, sugar gliders and fat-tailed dunnarts.|$|R
