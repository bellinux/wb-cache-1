He paid a local theatrical manager, Frank R Growcott, ten shillings a week to be a member of his company and be taught the craft of an actor. He made his stage debut in December 1920 with Growcott's St Nicholas Players at the St Nicholas Hall, Brighton, a converted bacon factory. He played a gendarme in an adaptation of Les Misérables, and was soon entrusted with larger parts including Banquo in Macbeth and Malvolio in Twelfth Night.|$|E

The mosque, built with mud and reeds, has two tall towers in pyramidal shape, one for the mihrab which faces towards Mecca forming the facade on the east and the other as a minaret in the northeast corner. These are <b>buttressed</b> <b>by</b> twelve bulbous shaped structures, which are fitted with timber elements.|$|E
5|$|Banagher was {{extensively}} {{planted by}} the English, {{particularly during the}} periods 1621–1642 and 1650–1690. The plantations {{had a profound impact}} on Ireland in several ways. The first was the destruction of the native ruling classes and their replacement with the Protestant Ascendancy, of British-origin (mostly English) Protestant landowners. Their position was <b>buttressed</b> <b>by</b> the Penal Laws, which denied political and land-owning rights to Roman Catholics. The dominance of this class in Irish life persisted until the late 18th century, and it voted for the Act of Union with Britain in 1800. As a result, by the early 20th century, Banagher had a mix of Irish of native descent and Irish of English descent and supported two churches, one Catholic and one Protestant, both of which still exist.|$|E

5|$|The Egyptian Army in Palestine {{was divided}} between {{infantry}} and cavalry regiments {{and consisted of}} thousands of professional soldiers, known as nezzam. During the revolt, this force was <b>buttressed</b> <b>by</b> over 15,000 reinforcements who arrived with Muhammad Ali, bringing the number of Egyptian soldiers in Palestine to well over 20,000. While its army {{did most of the}} fighting, Egypt also commissioned or requested the participation of various irregulars. In the southern Gaza region, Egypt dispatched Bedouin from the tribes of Awlad Ali, al-Jamaiyat, al-Jahma, and al-Fawayd to pursue rebels and raid their villages. In the northern Galilee region, {{towards the end of the}} revolt, the forces of Emir Bashir were mobilized upon Ibrahim Pasha's request, but their mobilization sufficed in convincing the northern rebels to surrender. Thus, Bashir's Lebanon-based forces saw no combat. Local peasant fighters under Husayn Abd al-Hadi also fought alongside the Egyptian army, particularly during the final battles for Jabal Nablus.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{following}} an appeal for help by Norodom Sihanouk, Angkor Wat was listed in UNESCO's World Heritage in Danger (later removed in 2004) and World Heritage Site {{together with an}} appeal by UNESCO {{to the international community}} to save Angkor. Zoning of the area was set up to protect the Angkor site in 1994, APSARA was established in 1995 to protect and manage the area, and a law to protect Cambodian heritage was passed in 1996. A number of countries such as France, Japan and China are currently involved in various Angkor Wat conservation projects. The German Apsara Conservation Project (GACP) is working to protect the devatas, and other bas-reliefs which decorate the temple, from damage. The organisation's survey found that around 20% of the devatas were in very poor condition, mainly because of natural erosion and deterioration of the stone but in part also due to earlier restoration efforts. Other work involves the repair of collapsed sections of the structure, and prevention of further collapse: the west facade of the upper level, for example, has been <b>buttressed</b> <b>by</b> scaffolding since 2002, while a Japanese team completed restoration of the north library of the outer enclosure in 2005. World Monuments Fund began conservation work on the Churning of the Sea of Milk Gallery in 2008 after several years of studies on its condition. The project restored the traditional Khmer roofing system and removed cement used in earlier restoration attempts that had resulted in salts entering the structure behind the bas-relief, discoloring and damaging the sculpted surfaces. The main phase of work ended in 2012, with the final component being the installation of finials {{on the roof of the}} gallery in 2013.|$|E

25|$|Portuguese banks hold {{strategic}} {{stakes in}} {{other sectors of}} the economy, including the insurance sector. Foreign bank participation is relatively high as is state ownership through the Caixa Geral de Depósitos (CGD). Overall, Portugal's financial system is sound, well managed and competitive, with shorter-term risks and vulnerabilities quite well contained, and with the system <b>buttressed</b> <b>by</b> a strong financial policy framework. Despite being relatively small and concentrated, Portugal's banking system generally compares well with other European Union (EU) countries in terms of efficiency, profitability, and asset quality, with solvency also close to European levels.|$|E
25|$|While {{the first}} years of the AFL saw uneven {{competition}} and low attendance, the league was <b>buttressed</b> <b>by</b> a generous television contract with the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) (followed by a contract with competing National Broadcasting Company (NBC) for games starting with the 1965 season) that broadcast the more offense-oriented football league nationwide. Continuing to attract top talent from colleges and the NFL by the mid-1960s, as well as successful franchise shifts of the Chargers from L.A. south to San Diego and the Texans north to Kansas City (becoming the Kansas City Chiefs), the AFL established a dedicated following. The transformation of the struggling Titans into the New York Jets under new ownership further solidified the league's reputation among the major media.|$|E
25|$|Moore's {{connection}} with the poem has been questioned by Professor Donald Foster, who used textual content analysis and external evidence to argue that Moore {{could not have been}} the author. Foster believes that Major Henry Livingston, Jr., a New Yorker with Dutch and Scottish roots, should be considered the chief candidate for authorship, a view long espoused by the Livingston family. Livingston was distantly related to Moore's wife. Foster's claim, however, has been countered by document dealer and historian Seth Kaller, who once owned one of Moore's original manuscripts of the poem. Kaller has offered a point-by-point rebuttal of both Foster's linguistic analysis and external findings, <b>buttressed</b> <b>by</b> the work of autograph expert James Lowe and Dr. Joe Nickell, author of Pen, Ink and Evidence.|$|E

25|$|The {{textbook}} {{became an}} item of national news coverage in April 2008. Matthew LaClair, a New Jersey high school senior expressed concerns to a think tank, the Center for Inquiry, regarding what he felt was conservative bias in the textbook, specifically inaccuracies about its coverage of global warming. He wrote an opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times. The group issued a critical report on the textbook. The group's criticism of the coverage on climate was <b>buttressed</b> <b>by</b> a few scientists and then additional criticism from legal scholars, who claimed the book presented a skewed view of {{separation of church and}} state. The publisher, Houghton Mifflin, announced that it would review the book, as did the College Board, which oversees college-level Advanced Placement courses used in high schools.|$|E
25|$|The city lies on {{the west}} bank of the Siem Reap River, a {{tributary}} of Tonle Sap, about a quarter of a mile from the river. The south gate of Angkor Thom is 7.2km north of Siem Reap, and 1.7km north of the entrance to Angkor Wat. The walls, 8m high and flanked by a moat, are each 3km long, enclosing an area of 9km². The walls are of laterite <b>buttressed</b> <b>by</b> earth, with a parapet on the top. There are gates at each of the cardinal points, from which roads lead to the Bayon at the centre of the city. As the Bayon itself has no wall or moat of its own, those of the city are interpreted by archaeologists as representing the mountains and oceans surrounding the Bayon's Mount Meru. Another gate—the Victory Gate—is 500m north of the east gate; the Victory Way runs parallel to the east road to the Victory Square and the Royal Palace north of the Bayon.|$|E
25|$|In the Battle of Germantown on 4 October 1777, Proctor's {{guns were}} {{commanded}} by Captain-Lieutenant Brewer and Lieutenants Barker and Ritter. During the fighting, British {{soldiers of the}} 40th Foot took refuge in the Chew House. Two of Proctor's guns and two captured 6-pound guns began firing at the house. They quickly blasted open the front doors, but unknown to the gunners, {{the front of the}} house was <b>buttressed</b> <b>by</b> two feet of stonework that resisted their round shot. The gunners also fired grapeshot at the second floor in an attempt to suppress the return fire. The 1st and 3rd New Jersey Regiments repeatedly tried to storm the building but they were driven off with heavy losses. During the action, four cannons from Brigadier General William Woodford's Virginia Brigade opened fire on the other side of the house, blowing open the back door and causing much damage. Some cannonballs passed entirely through the house by the windows, causing the Americans to believe that the defenders had their own artillery. The British successfully defended the Chew House and were rescued when the American army retreated.|$|E

25|$|Oversight of the {{construction}} has been credited by various sources to either master masons John Box or Henry Yevele, or to William of Wykeham. The work required some 1,600 craftsmen and labourers, and was completed by about 1367 {{at a cost of}} some £20,000. The castle was built to a radical concentric design, the first of its type to be built in England. It consisted of a large circular building, described as a rotunda or shell keep, <b>buttressed</b> <b>by</b> six projecting towers and having a central circular courtyard. This main building was surrounded by an outer circular curtain wall and a moat. It is possible that the design was influenced by that of Bellver Castle, which had been built in Majorca between 1300 and 1311 for King James II of Majorca. Queenborough {{was one of the first}} English castles built to withstand siege artillery and to mount guns itself, and the last royal castle to be built in England during the Late Middle Ages. Originally, water was channelled from the roofs through lead piping into storage cisterns, but in 1393 a contractor spent sixty weeks digging a deep well in the centre of the courtyard.|$|E
25|$|The Brahmin was {{expected}} to maintain the customary English reserve in his dress, manner, and deportment, cultivate the arts, support charities such as hospitals and colleges, and {{assume the role of}} community leader. Although the ideal called on him to transcend commonplace business values, in practice many found the thrill of economic success quite attractive. The Brahmins warned each other against avarice and insisted upon personal responsibility. Scandal and divorce were unacceptable. The total system was <b>buttressed</b> <b>by</b> the strong extended family ties present in Boston society. Young men attended the same prep schools, colleges, and private clubs, and heirs married heiresses. Family not only served as an economic asset, but also as a means of moral restraint. Most belong to the Unitarian or Episcopal churches, although some were Congregationalists or Methodists. Politically they were successively Federalists, Whigs, and Republicans. They were marked by their manners and once distinctive elocution, the Boston Brahmin accent, a version of the New England accent. Their distinctive Anglo-American manner of dress has been much imitated and is the foundation of the style now informally known as preppy. Many of the Brahmin families trace their ancestry back to the original 17th- and 18th-century colonial ruling class consisting of Massachusetts governors and magistrates, Harvard presidents, distinguished clergy and fellows of the Royal Society of London (a leading scientific body), while others entered New England aristocratic society during the 19th century with their profits from commerce and trade, often marrying into established Brahmin families.|$|E

40|$|Greenland outlet glaciers {{are among}} the largest {{contributors}} to global sea level rise. With high velocities and calving rates, they discharge large amounts of glacial ice into the ocean. During the last two decades, the mass loss of these glaciers has increased dramatically. Jakobshavn Isbræ recently experienced dramatic acceleration to peak velocities of 17 km yr- 1; in contrast to other fast Greenland glaciers, its high velocities have persisted. Many studies have explained the observed acceleration with increased ocean water temperatures, increased surface runoff and reduced <b>buttressing</b> <b>by</b> sea ice. However, {{it is still not}} completely understood how external factors, such as changes by the atmosphere and ocean, impact marine-terminating glaciers. Here, the impact of ice temperature, basal sliding, crevasse water depth, submarine melt rate, and <b>buttressing</b> <b>by</b> sea ice on glacier properties is studied with a numerical flowband model. A sensitivity study is conducted on an idealized marine-terminating glacier and on Jakobshavn Isbræ. Changes to the driving as well as internal parameters of the ice flow model have a great impact on the idealized glacier. Whilst a change in crevasse water depth, <b>buttressing</b> <b>by</b> sea ice, and submarine melt impact the thickness and length proportionally, basal sliding and ice rheology in uence rather the shape of the glacier. The ice temperature is represented by the rate factor, a complex parameter, found to influence the glacier in opposing ways through its control on the viscosity and lateral resistance. The study of Jakobshavn Isbræ shows that stabilization at pinning points dominates the impact of parameter uncertainties. The grounding line position can therefore be stable for hundreds of years, while the thickness of the glacier continues adjusting to previous perturbations. This adjustment may eventually lead to a dramatic change of the grounding line position. It is therefore crucial for ice sheet models to involve centennial to millennial time-scales. </p...|$|R

500|$|The sculpture's weight raised concerns. Estimating the {{thickness}} of the steel needed to create the sculpture's desired aesthetics before fabrication was difficult. Cloud Gate was originally estimated to weigh [...] when completed. However, the final figure was almost twice as heavy at [...] This extra weight required engineers to reconsider the sculpture's supporting structures. The roof of the Park Grill, upon which Cloud Gate sits, had to be built strong enough to bear the weight. The large retaining wall separating Chicago's Metra train tracks from the North Grant Park garage supports much of the weight of the sculpture and forms {{the back side of the}} restaurant. This wall, along with the rest of the garage's foundation, required additional bracing before the piece was erected.
