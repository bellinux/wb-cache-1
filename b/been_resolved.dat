5|$|The {{investments}} had drained Holmenkolbanen, {{particularly after}} it had received a massive lawsuit for damage to adjacent properties during the tunneling.

Aker Municipality offered to transfer its ownership of the Smestad Line and the Sognsvann Line to Holmenkolbanen, {{in exchange for the}} majority of shares in the company.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{consensus}} on pacifism among modern Hindu scholars. The conflict between pacifistic interpretations of Ahimsa and the theories of just war prescribed by the Gita has <b>been</b> <b>resolved</b> by some scholars such as Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, as being an allegory, wherein the battlefield is the soul and Arjuna, the war is within each human being, where man's higher impulses struggle against his own evil impulses.|$|E

50|$|Turns are alternate. In {{their turn}} a player dices for Player Initiative Points (PIPs), spell casting and {{shooting}} <b>is</b> <b>resolved</b> and finally close combat <b>is</b> <b>resolved.</b> A player's PIPs {{are used to}} move elements, cast spells and perform certain other actions. Shooting, spell casting and close combat <b>is</b> <b>resolved</b> using the same mechanisms; shooting and spell casting <b>are</b> <b>resolved</b> between any elements in range, close combat between adjacent elements. Combat results generally cause elements to recoil, flee or be destroyed outright. An army loses if its general is lost, half its points are lost or, if the defender, its stronghold is lost. A game generally lasts less than an hour.|$|R

5|$|When {{platinum}} {{was declared}} a strategic government resource during World War II, many jewelry bands were {{made out of}} palladium. As recently as September 2001, palladium was more expensive than platinum and rarely used in jewelry because of the technical difficulty of casting. Currently, the casting problem has <b>been</b> <b>resolved</b> and use in jewelry has increased because platinum has increased in price while palladium decreased.|$|E
5|$|According to the AACAP Practice Parameter (2005) the {{question}} of whether attachment disorders can reliably be diagnosed in older children and adults has not <b>been</b> <b>resolved.</b> Attachment behaviors used for the diagnosis of RAD change markedly with development and defining analogous behaviors in older children is difficult. There are no substantially validated measures of attachment in middle childhood or early adolescence. Assessments of RAD past school age may not be possible at all as by this time children have developed along individual lines {{to such an extent that}} early attachment experiences are only one factor among many that determine emotion and behavior.|$|E
5|$|By 1970 these {{differences}} had not <b>been</b> <b>resolved,</b> and Brezhnev postponed the 24th Party Congress and the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1971–1975). The delay in resolving these issues led to rumours circulating in Soviet society that Kosygin, or even Brezhnev, {{would lose their}} posts to Podgorny. By March 1971 {{it became apparent that}} Brezhnev was the leader of the country, with Kosygin as the spokesman of the five-year plan and Podgorny's position within the collective leadership strengthened.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} that the opening phases of the East Timor {{operation}} began in 1999, the issue regarding the purpose of the Army Reserve still had not <b>been</b> <b>resolved.</b> Instead of being able to provide formed units to augment the Regular Army, the Reserves was reduced to providing individuals for round-out purposes only. As a result, in the initial phase of the operation there were only 100 Reservists available to fill positions in INTERFET, mostly in specialist roles that the Regular Army had trouble providing. As the deployment progressed to a second rotation in April 2000, however, a further 630 Reservists volunteered for full-time service.|$|E
5|$|Congestion pricing remains highly {{controversial}} {{with the public}} {{both before and after}} implementation. This has in part <b>been</b> <b>resolved</b> through referendums, such as after the seven-month trial period in Stockholm; however this creates a debate as to where the border line for the referendum should go, since it is often the people living outside the urban area who have to pay the tax, while the external benefit is granted those who live within the area. In Stockholm there was a majority in the referendum within the city border (where the votes counted), but not outside.|$|E

5|$|Following the delay, the Space Head Module {{was removed}} from the rocket, and {{returned}} to its integration building on 22 February. Whilst it was in the integration building, daily inspections were made to ensure that the spacecraft was still functioning normally. Once the fuel issue had <b>been</b> <b>resolved,</b> the launch was rescheduled for 8 April, and launch operations resumed. On 1 April, the Space Head Module was returned to the silo, and reinstalled atop the Dnepr. Following integrated tests, the practice countdown was successfully conducted on 6 April.|$|E
5|$|In January 2011, the Danish Ministry of Defence {{reportedly}} {{could not}} afford the retrofitting of the AW101 fleet for Afghanistan operations, against earlier reports of a deployment in 2012. In February 2013, Aviation Week reported that earlier reliability problems had <b>been</b> <b>resolved</b> and that a full upgrade package would be applied to Danish AW101s; these included the addition of electronic warfare pods and a new electro-optical system, in advance of a deployment in Afghanistan in 2014. In September 2013, Danish AW101s were to receive L-3 Wescam MX-15 electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensors; SAR aircraft already carry the FLIR Systems Star Safire II EO/IR sensor.|$|E
5|$|Seeking {{national}} reconciliation between revolutionaries and Catholics, the Concordat of 1801 was signed on 15 July 1801 between Napoleon and Pope Pius VII.

The hostility of devout Catholics against the state had now largely <b>been</b> <b>resolved.</b> It did not restore the vast church lands and endowments that had been seized during the revolution and sold off.
