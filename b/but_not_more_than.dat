Clomethiazole is discouraged for unsupervised detoxification because of its addictive potential, its tendency to induce tolerance, and its risk of death when mixed with alcohol. The pills were prescribed by Geoffrey Dymond, a physician who was unaware of Moon's lifestyle.

Within the World Battles category, there are four titles including three-on-three breaking champions, one-on-one popping champion, one-on-one locking champion, and one-on-one all styles (freestyle) champion. The World Hip Hop Dance Championship is for hip-hop crews. There are four divisions: junior (ages 7–12), varsity (12–18), adult (18+), and mega crew (all ages). Each crew must have at least five <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> nine people (mega crew must have 15–40) and must perform a routine that showcases three styles of hip-hop dance. For the 2009 competition, there were 120 crews representing 30 countries. HHI also created the USA Hip Hop Dance Championship and the television show America's Best Dance Crew.|$|E

5|$|Like {{most state}} chief {{executives}} in the United States, the Governor is elected by the citizens of Maryland to serve a four-year term. Under the Constitution of Maryland, the Governor can run any number of times, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> twice in a row. This {{makes it possible for}} a two-term governor to run for the office again after remaining out of office for at least one term. An eligible candidate for Governor must be at least 30 years old, and also a resident of and a registered voter in Maryland for the five years preceding the election. If a candidate meets this minimum requirement, he or she must file his or her candidacy with the Maryland State Board of Elections, pay a filing fee, file a financial disclosure, and create a legal campaign financial body. The Governor, like all statewide officials in Maryland, is elected in the even-numbered years in which the election for President of the United States does not occur.|$|E

25|$|The {{foundation}} Naschet Jenische (literally: arise, Yenish!) {{was established}} in 1986, focussing on the refurbishment and 'reparations' of the injustice perpetrated against the Yenish (Fahrende) people in Switzerland, in particular by the programm Kinder der Landstrasse. In 1988 a fund commission, which regulated the inspection for the affected Yenish people, was established and completed their work in 1992. The inspection of the files of Pro Juventute is governed since then directly by the Swiss Federal Archives (Bundesarchiv). The affected Yenish people received in all 11 million Swiss Francs, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 20,000 Swiss Francs each. The advice and support of people and families affected by Kinder der Landstrasse is still {{the main focus of}} the activities of the foundation. The foundation advises Yenish people in personal, family and social problems, in particular in contacts with the Swiss authorities, and assists in the inspection of personal files. The foundation also supports the search and the reuninicfaction of families. Yenish people are assisted with applications for financial assistance to public and private institutions. Advice can be also invoked in the case of difficulties with insurance and taxes. The consultancy activity is financed by Pro Juventute. Another important part of the foundation's activities are the public relations; Naschet Jenische informs about the history and the current situation in Switzerland and arbitrates contacts.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the general nature of {{attributions}} of Chinese parents in the U. S. regarding their preschool children's social behaviors. Eighty-seven parents with preschool children participated. The attributions were examined along three causal dimensions: locus of causality (internal versus external), stability (stable versus unstable), and controllability (controllable versus uncontrollable). The types of child social behaviors studied were positive social behaviors, aggression, and withdrawal. The study looked at the contributions of child age, child gender, parent gender, and parent adaptation to life in the U. S. to parental attributions. It also investigated whether different types of child social behaviors (i. e., positive, aggressive, and withdrawn behaviors) elicited different types of attributions from parents. Results indicated that older children's social behaviors elicited similar attributions from Chinese parents as younger children's. Chinese parents saw girls' withdrawn behaviors as more internally caused and controllable, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>more</b> stable, <b>than</b> boys' withdrawn behaviors. However, no difference was found between boys' and girls' aggressive or positive social behaviors. Chinese parents saw their children's positive social behaviors as more internally caused, stable and controllable than their children's negative social (aggressive and withdrawn) behaviors. In addition, Chinese parents saw their children's withdrawn behaviors as <b>more</b> internally caused, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>more</b> stable or controllable, than their children's aggressive behaviors. Fathers and mothers were not significantly different in their attributions for their children's social behaviors. No parent gender effect was found. Chinese parents who were more adapted to life in the U. S. saw their children's positive social behaviors as more stable and controllable by their children, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>more</b> internal, <b>than</b> Chinese parents less adapted. In addition, these more highly adapted Chinese parents saw their children's aggressive behaviors as more unstable and uncontrollable by their children, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>more</b> external, <b>than</b> Chinese parents less adapted. Furthermore, more highly adapted Chinese parents saw their children's withdrawn behaviors as more externally caused and less controllable, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>more</b> unstable, <b>than</b> Chinese parents less adapted...|$|R
25|$|As of 24 February 2011, for {{the purpose}} of Parliamentary elections, Singapore was divided into 27 electoral {{divisions}} (also known as constituencies).

In a GRC, all the candidates must either be members of the same political party or independent candidates standing as a group, and {{at least one of the}} candidates must be a person belonging to the Malay, Indian or some other minority community. The President, at Cabinet's direction, declares the electoral divisions that are to be GRCs; the number of candidates (not less than three <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> six) to stand for Parliament in each GRC; and whether the minority candidates in each GRC are to be from the Malay, Indian, or other minority communities.
