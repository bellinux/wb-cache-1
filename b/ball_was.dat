5|$|Kirby's Block Ball is a 1995 action video game, a {{spin-off}} {{from the}} Kirby {{series for the}} Game Boy portable console. It is a Breakout clone; the player controls paddles along the screen's edge to knock a bouncing ball, Kirby, into destructible bricks. The game's 55 levels include power-ups, bonus rounds, and minigames. Kirby's Block <b>Ball</b> <b>was</b> developed by HAL Laboratory and Nintendo R. The team spent half a year revising the gameplay to match Kirby's signature characteristics. Kirby's Block <b>Ball</b> <b>was</b> published by Nintendo first in Japan in 1995, later in Europe, and last in North America in 1996.|$|E
5|$|A bodyline {{delivery}} was {{one where}} the cricket <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> bowled at {{the body of the}} batsman, in the hope that when he defended himself with his bat, a resulting deflection could be caught by one of several fielders standing close by. This was considered by critics to be intimidatory and physically threatening, {{to the point of being}} unfair in a game that was supposed to uphold gentlemanly traditions.|$|E

5|$|According to MCC {{guidelines}} for umpires, factors {{to consider when}} giving an lbw decision include the angle at which the <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> travelling and whether the <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> swinging through the air. He must also account for {{the height of the}} ball at impact and how far from the wicket the batsman was standing; from this information he must determine if the ball would have passed over the stumps or struck them. The MCC guidance states that it is easier to make a decision when the ball strikes the batsman without pitching, but that the difficulty increases when the ball has bounced and more so when there is a shorter time between the ball pitching and striking the batsman.|$|E

5|$|Because Virginia Tech {{kicked off}} to Indiana {{to begin the}} game, Indiana kicked off to Virginia Tech to begin the second half. In {{response}} to the celebration following the 80-yard touchdown prior to halftime, Virginia Tech was assessed two 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalties. Indiana kicked off from the Tech 40-yard line, and the <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> downed at the Virginia Tech 11-yard line. A false-start penalty against the Hokies didn't prevent them from gaining a first down on a pass from DeShazo to Swarm. Swarm picked up another first down on his own, advancing {{the ball to the}} Tech 38-yard line with a rush up the middle. Tech continued to advance the ball with Thomas, Swarm and DeShazo rushing the ball and picking up first downs. Now on the Indiana side of the field, DeShazo attempted a deep pass, but the <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> intercepted by Indiana cornerback Jason Orton.|$|E

5|$|Coal {{balls in}} North America were first found in Iowa coal seams in 1894, {{although}} {{the connection to}} European coal balls was not made until Adolf Carl Noé (whose coal <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> found by Gilbert Cady) drew the parallel in 1922. Noé's work renewed interest in coal balls, and by the 1930s had drawn paleobotanists from Europe to the Illinois Basin in search of them.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{starting}} {{almost at}} midfield, the offensive drive that {{began at the}} end of the third quarter failed to reach field goal range, and the Hokies were forced to punt. Boston College's offense fared no better, however, and punted after a three-and-out possession. The <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> downed at the Virginia Tech 16-yard line, and the Hokies began their first full offensive possession of the fourthquarter.|$|E

5|$|Following the turnover, the Tar Heels had a {{first down}} at their 32-yard line. Linton was stopped for no gain on a rushing play, passed for no gain, then {{completed}} a nine-yard pass to Brown. Failing to gain the first down, the Tar Heels punted and the <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> returned to the 30-yard line. Oxendine gained two yards on a rush up the right side, then Sorensen ran for one yard {{on the left side}} of the field. On third down, Sorensen scrambled for {{a first down}} before fumbling the football. The loose <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> picked up by Tech lineman Derek Smith, and the Hokies' drive continued. After a rush for no gain, another running play resulted in a Tech fumble, their second of the drive. Unlike the previous fumble, however, this one was recovered by North Carolina's Russell Davis, and the Tar Heels offense was put into position for another scoring attempt.|$|E

5|$|Handled the <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> {{formerly}} one of {{the methods}} of dismissing a batsman in the sport of cricket, but was integrated into the Law on obstructing the field when the Laws of Cricket were rewritten in 2017. It dictated that either batsman can be given out if they intentionally touch the ball with a hand that is not holding their bat. An exception was given if the batsman handled the ball to avoid injury. It was governed by Law 33 of the 2000 Edition of the Laws, and was a rare way for a batsman to be dismissed: {{in the history of}} cricket, there have been 61 instances in first-class matches and 5 occasions in List A games. In most cases this occurred when a batsman thought that the <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> going to hit their wicket, and knocked it away from the stumps with their hand.|$|E
5|$|In the 77th minute, Keenor, Ferguson and Davies {{passed the}} ball among {{themselves}} before playing it wide to Thirlaway. Ferguson {{ran to the}} centre and the <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> crossed towards him. Ferguson leapt and headed {{the ball into the}} net to equalise for Cardiff. It looked like Cardiff were about to go ahead, however, a last minute tackle by Alfred Bower prevented Ernie Curtis from scoring, giving the Welsh team another corner. The <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> fired towards the goal mouth, and was shot into the goal from close range by Davies putting Cardiff ahead. The final two attacks of the game were both by Cardiff, with Russell saving a header by Ferguson and then Curtis firing the ball over the crossbar.|$|E
5|$|Kansas {{took over}} {{at its own}} 12-yard line after the punt. On the first play of the drive, Reesing {{completed}} a 37-yard pass to Dexton Fields, putting the ball near midfield. Three straight incomplete passes later, Kansas faced a fourth-and-ten and a punt. Instead of punting the ball away, however, Kansas elected to try a risky fake punt-pass. Instead of snapping {{the ball to the}} punter, the <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> snapped to running back Brandon McAnderson, who threw the ball 22yards downfield to Micah Brown for a first down. On the very next play, Reesing, having returned to the field, connected on a 28-yard pass to Dexton Fields, who was pushed out of bounds just short of the goal line. With a first-and-goal from inside the one-yard line, a Kansas touchdown seemed inevitable. On the first play inside the red zone, however, Kansas fumbled the ball. Though the <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> recovered by a Kansas player, the play lost fouryards. On the next play, Kansas committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty. The personal foul was followed by a 10-yard holding penalty, and Kansas was pushed entirely outside the Virginia Tech red zone. In an effort to push back, Reesing threw a pass deep downfield. Instead of being completed, however, the <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> intercepted by Virginia Tech's D.J. Parker. With 39seconds left in the quarter, Virginia Tech had stopped Kansas from gaining a point despite the Jayhawks penetrating inside the Virginia Tech one-yard line.|$|E
