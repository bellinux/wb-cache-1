50|$|A {{syntactic}} unit of an idiolect {{system is}} a sequence of syntactic <b>base</b> <b>forms.</b> (Again, unit sequences, but not the empty sequence, are allowed as a limiting case of syntactic units, that is, a syntactic unit may contain a single syntactic <b>base</b> <b>form.)</b> In a system of a spoken idiolect, the syntactic <b>base</b> <b>forms</b> are precisely the phonological words occurring in the phonological {{part of the system}} (analogously, for systems of written and signed idiolects).|$|R
5000|$|A regular English verb {{has only}} one {{principal}} part, from which all the forms of the verb can be derived. This is the <b>base</b> <b>form</b> or dictionary form. For example, from the <b>base</b> <b>form</b> exist, all the inflected forms of the verb (exist, exists, existed, existing) can be predictably derived. The <b>base</b> <b>form</b> is also called the bare infinitive; another common way of referring to verbs {{is to use the}} to-infinitive, e.g. [...] "to exist".|$|R
5000|$|With regular verbs, {{the past}} tense is formed (in terms of spelling) by adding -ed to the <b>base</b> <b>form</b> (play → played). Normal rules for adding suffixes {{beginning}} with a vowel apply: If the <b>base</b> <b>form</b> ends in e then only d is added (like → liked); if the <b>base</b> <b>form</b> ends in a consonant followed by y then the y is changed to i before adding the ending (try → tried; an exception is the verb [...] (a ball), which can form skied or skyed).|$|R
25|$|The {{foliage of}} the Macroneuropteris species {{consists}} of very large frond-like leaves that are bipartite (divided in two) near the <b>base,</b> <b>forming</b> two large bipinnately compound parts (see illustration). These compound fronds {{can be as}} large as several meters.|$|E
25|$|The spike-like inflorescences {{consist of}} glomerules {{of one to}} three flowers sitting in the axils of leaf-like bracts. The free flowers are hermaphrodite. The {{perianth}} consists of five herbaceous, slightly keeled tepal lobes which are connate at base. There are five stamens opposite to the tepals, their filaments are fused at <b>base</b> <b>forming</b> a disc. The ovary is semi-inferior with 2 stigmas.|$|E

50|$|The {{comparative}} {{is formed}} by adding -er to the <b>base</b> <b>form.</b> For adjectives that end in -r, the comparative is formed by adding -der to the <b>base</b> <b>form</b> instead.

25|$|In the Faboideae, {{the flowers}} are zygomorphic, and have a {{specialized}} structure. The upper petal, called the banner, is large and envelops {{the rest of the}} petals in bud, often reflexing when the flower blooms. The two adjacent petals, the wings, surround the two bottom petals. The two bottom petals are fused together at the apex (remaining free at the <b>base),</b> <b>forming</b> a boat-like structure called the keel. The stamens are always ten in number, and their filaments can be fused in various configurations, often in a group of nine stamens plus one separate stamen. Various genes in the CYCLOIDEA (CYC)/DICHOTOMA (DICH) family are expressed in the upper (also called dorsal or adaxial) petal; in some species, such as Cadia, these genes are expressed throughout the flower, producing a radially symmetrical flower.|$|E

500|$|Plants {{also provide}} housing and food items for natural enemies of herbivores, known as [...] "biotic" [...] defense mechanisms, {{as a means}} to {{maintain}} their presence. For example, trees from the genus Macaranga have adapted their thin stem walls to create ideal housing for an ant species (genus Crematogaster), which, in turn, protects the plant from herbivores. In addition to providing housing, the plant also provides the ant with its exclusive food source; from the food bodies produced by the plant. Similarly, some Acacia tree species have developed thorns that are swollen at the <b>base,</b> <b>forming</b> a hollowing structure that acts as housing. These Acacia trees also produce nectar in extrafloral nectaries on their leaves as food for the ants.|$|E

500|$|The {{style of}} the new churches evidences that a [...] "genuine school of local architects" [...] {{developed}} during Stephen's reign. They borrowed components of Byzantine and Gothic architecture and mixed it with elements of local tradition. Painted walls and towers with a <b>base</b> <b>forming</b> a star were the most featuring elements of Stephen's churches. The prince also financed the building of churches in Transylvania and Wallachia, which contributed {{to the spread of}} Moldavian architecture beyond the boundaries of the principality. Stephen commissioned votive paintings and carved tomb stones for many of his ancestors' and other relatives' graves. The tomb room of the Putna Monastery was built to be the royal necropolis of Stephen's family. Stephen's own tombstone was decorated with acanthus leaves (a motif adopted from Byzantine art) which became the featuring decorative element of Moldavian art during the following century.|$|E

2500|$|The {{boundary}} between the two species Mandragora autumnalis and Mandragora officinarum varies among authors, with some regarding them as the same species (see § Taxonomy below). Whatever distinction is used, plants of M.autumnalis are herbaceous perennials, with a large upright tap-root, often branched and sometimes shaped somewhat like a person. There {{is little or no}} stem, the leaves being borne in a basal rosette up to [...] across. The flowers are clustered at the centre of the rosette, each with five sepals, five petals and five stamens. Both the sepals and petals are fused at the <b>base</b> <b>forming</b> two five-lobed bell-shaped cups. The ovary has two chambers (locules) and a long style.

[...] A wooden lintel was illegally removed from the temple in the late 1960s and sold to the Denver Art Museum in the United States, provoking the first official visits and explorations of the site. The looted lintel was returned to Guatemala in 1998. The lintel was carved from five planks of sapodilla wood, forming a panel [...] long and [...] wide.

The feet of the Maleo are not nearly so large or strong in proportion as in these birds, while its claws are short and straight instead of being long and much curved. The toes are, however, strongly webbed at the <b>base,</b> <b>forming</b> a broad powerful foot, which, with the rather long leg, is well adapted to scratch away the loose sand (which flies up in a perfect shower when the birds are at work), but which could not without much labour accumulate the heaps of miscellaneous rubbish, which the large grasping feet of the Megapodius bring together with ease.|$|E
