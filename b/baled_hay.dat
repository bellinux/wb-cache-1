60|$|While we looked, {{the waters}} {{increased}} so fast {{in this place}} {{that in a few}} minutes a torrent was roaring by the little stable and its margin encroaching steadily on the logs. We suddenly realized that this flood was not a mere holiday spectacle, but meant damage--and not only to the small log stable but to the Overland buildings close to the main river, for the waves had now come ashore and were creeping about the foundations and invading the great hay-corral adjoining. We ran down and joined the crowd of excited men and frightened animals. We waded knee-deep into the log stable, unfastened the horses and waded out almost waist-deep, so fast the waters increased. Then the crowd rushed in a body to the hay-corral and began to tumble down the huge stacks of <b>baled</b> <b>hay</b> and roll the bales up on the high ground by the house. Meantime it was discovered that Owens, an overland driver, was missing, and a man ran to the large stable, and wading in, boot-top deep, discovered him asleep in his bed, awoke him, and waded out again. But Owens was drowsy and resumed his nap; but only for a minute or two, for presently he turned in his bed, his hand dropped over the side and came in contact with the cold water! It was up level with the mattress! He waded out, breast-deep, almost, and the next moment the sun-burned bricks melted down like sugar and the big building crumbled to a ruin and was washed away in a twinkling.|$|E

40|$|The {{negative}} consequences of <b>baling</b> <b>hay</b> before it is adequately dried are widely known to producers. Frequently, these problems are created by uncooperative weather conditions that prevent forages from drying (rapidly) to concentrations of moisture that allow safe and stable storage of harvested forages. Negative consequences associated with <b>baling</b> <b>hay</b> before it is adequately dried include molding, spontaneous heating, undesirable changes in forage quality, {{and the potential for}} spontaneous combustion. The magnitude and duration of spontaneous heating is affected by numerous variables, including forage moisture content, bale size, bale density, climatic conditions, and use of preservatives. Most changes in nutritive value, including estimates of ruminal protein degradation and the associated ruminal decay rate, are related to spontaneous heating in surprising close linear relationships. Spontaneous heating has a profoundly negative overall effect on forage quality, and great care should be exercised to properly dehydrate forages prior to baling, thereby avoiding this undesirable phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of ventilated barn hay {{results in a}} high quality fodder for ruminants. Nevertheless, this production method is still a niche in Germany even it is found in organic farming. Reasons are the few publications about required investments of the needed technology for hay drying in the barn. This article provides investment and energy costs for different drying techniques: for box hay drying three different farm sizes were compared, for <b>bale</b> <b>hay</b> drying only one farm size is calculated. <b>Bale</b> <b>hay</b> drying demands more power and investment cost as box hay drying of loose <b>hay.</b> <b>Bale</b> drying {{is more complicated than}} barn drying in that the number of bale drying locations in a barn is a limiting factor to throughput, as is also the drying of densely packed bales. Barn drying is above all practical on farms where hay is the only forage on offer. Its particular advantage is the large amounts of crop that can be dried at the same time. Bale drying tends to be applied more on farms that want their forage partly as grass silage and partly as barn-dried hay...|$|R

When the Little Jonny mine opened, vast quantities of high-grade copper and gold were found. The grade of gold was so pure and the vein so wide that it was heralded as the world's richest gold strike. By October 29, 1893, the Little Jonny was shipping 135 tons [...] of gold ore per day. J.J. was awarded 12,500 shares or 12.5% of stock and {{a seat on the}} board. The Ibex Company and its owners, including the Browns, became extraordinarily wealthy.
