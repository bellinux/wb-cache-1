40|$|The BISTRO Survey (B-fields in Star-forming Region Observations) {{is one of}} the six next {{generation}} Large Programmes currently being carried out on the JCMT. It is the only Large Programme that is using the new SCUBA 2 polarimeter POL 2. This exciting programme plans to map the densest regions of all of the nearby star-forming regions within the Gould Belt, to measure the magnetic field orientation and strength in all of these regions. We will present the latest results from the BISTRO survey - a large programme using SCUBA 2 and POL 2 on JCMT. We will show the structure of the B-fields in several nearby Gould Belt star-forming regions, including Orion, Serpens and Ophiuchus. We will compare our results to various model predictions and theoretical simulations. The ultimate goals of the <b>BISTRO</b> <b>programme</b> are to understand dust grain alignment mechanisms, to compare the data to models of magnetic field geometry, and to explore the relations between fields and filaments, turbulence, outflows, and core geometries. We will comment on these topics...|$|E
