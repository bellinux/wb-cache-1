50|$|The organization's {{cooperation}} with industry and business came {{about as a}} result of recognition by the <b>Bellona</b> <b>Foundation</b> that the environmental movement alone {{would not be able to}} impel the necessary changes in order to counter the impending threats against environment.

50|$|Born in Sandefjord, Norway, Hauge {{was active}} in the {{environmental}} organization Natur og Ungdom as a schoolboy, and eventually dropped out of secondary school to concentrate full-time on environmental issues. In 1985 he emerged as leader {{of a small group of}} environmental activists who received broad press coverage of their nontraditional methods. Among their focus was pointing out locations where toxic industrial waste had been buried. They also fought against plans for disposal of hazardous waste from titanium mines into Jøssingfjorden. In 1986 he co-founded the <b>Bellona</b> <b>Foundation,</b> which continued the activist style. The early history of Bellona was subject for a documentary book already in 1988, Bellona.

50|$|The Sahara Forest Project is {{a scheme}} {{that aims to}} provide fresh water, food and {{renewable}} energy in hot, arid regions as well as re-vegetating areas of uninhabited desert. This proposal combines saltwater-cooled greenhouses with solar power technologies, either directly using Photovoltaic (PV) or indirectly using concentrated solar power (CSP) and technologies for desert revegetation. It is claimed that these technologies together will create a sustainable and profitable source of energy, food, vegetation and water. The founding team behind the Sahara Forest Project was composed of experts from Seawater Greenhouse Ltd, Exploration Architecture, Max Fordham Consulting Engineers and the <b>Bellona</b> <b>Foundation.</b> The scale of the proposed scheme is such that very large quantities of seawater would be evaporated. By using locations below sea level, pumping costs would be eliminated. A project in Qatar has been completed, and pilot projects in Jordan and Tunisia have been initiated.|$|E

50|$|The 1991 {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union led to a severe decline in the Russian Navy. Defense expenditures were severely reduced. Many ships were scrapped or laid up as accommodation ships at naval bases, and the building program was essentially stopped. Sergey Gorshkov's buildup during the Soviet period had emphasised ships over support facilities, but Gorshkov had also retained ships in service beyond their effective lifetimes, so a reduction had been inevitable in any event. The situation was exacerbated by the impractical range of vessel types which the Soviet military-industrial complex, {{with the support of}} the leadership, had forced on the navy—taking modifications into account, the Soviet Navy in the mid-1980s had nearly 250 different classes of ship. The Kiev class aircraft carrying cruisers and many other ships were prematurely retired, and the incomplete second Admiral Kuznetsov class aircraft carrier Varyag was eventually sold to the People's Republic of China by Ukraine. Funds were only allocated for the completion of ships ordered prior to the collapse of the USSR, as well as for refits and repairs on fleet ships taken out of service since. However, the construction times for these ships tended to stretch out extensively: in 2003 it was reported that the Akula-class submarine Nerpa had been under construction for fifteen years. Storage of decommissioned nuclear submarines in ports near Murmansk became a significant issue, with the <b>Bellona</b> <b>Foundation</b> reporting details of lowered readiness. Naval support bases outside Russia, such as Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam, were gradually closed, with the exception of the modest technical support base in Tartus, Syria to support ships deployed to the Mediterranean. Naval Aviation declined as well from its height as Soviet Naval Aviation, dropping from an estimated 60,000 personnel with some 1,100 combat aircraft in 1992 to 35,000 personnel with around 270 combat aircraft in 2006. In 2002, out of 584 naval aviation crews only 156 were combat ready, and 77 ready for night flying. Average annual flying time was 21.7 hours, compared to 24 hours in 1999.|$|E
5000|$|In 2011, the FSB {{said it had}} exposed 199 foreign spies, {{including}} 41 professional spies and 158 agents {{employed by}} foreign intelligence services. The number has risen in recent years: in 2006 the FSB reportedly caught about 27 foreign intelligence officers and 89 foreign agents. Comparing the number of exposed spies historically, the then-FSB Director Nikolay Kovalyov said in 1996: [...] "There has never been such a number of spies arrested by us since the time when German agents were sent in {{during the years of}} World War II." [...] The 2011 figure is similar to what was reported in 1995-1996, when around 400 foreign intelligence agents were uncovered during the two-year period. In a high-profile case of foreign espionage, the FSB said in February 2012 that an engineer working at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia's main space center for military launches, had been sentenced to 13 years in prison on charges of state treason. A court judged that the engineer had sold information about testing of new Russian strategic missile systems to the American CIA. An increasing number of scientists have been accused of espionage and illegal technology exports by the FSB during the last decade: researcher Igor Sutyagin, physicist Valentin Danilov, physical chemist Oleg Korobeinichev, academician Oskar Kaibyshev, and physicist Yury Ryzhov. Ecologist and journalist Alexander Nikitin, who worked with the <b>Bellona</b> <b>Foundation,</b> was accused of espionage.

Other arrested people include Viktor Orekhov, a former KGB officer who assisted Soviet dissidents, Vladimir Kazantsev who disclosed illegal purchases of eavesdropping devices from foreign firms, and Vil Mirzayanov who had written that Russia was working on a nerve-gas weapon.|$|E

40|$|The ECOMET-S {{smelting}} plant reprocessing radioactive scrap metal and situated within {{the grounds of}} Leningrad nuclear power plant experienced another accident at 3 a. m. on December 15, this time resulting {{in the loss of}} a young man's life. (640. 5738) WISE Amsterdam- An explosion in the plant's electrically heated furnace caused molten metal, at temperatures as high as 1200 °C, to be expelled hitting three workers, one of whom, 33 year old Vitaly Lanbrozo, subsequently died from his injuries. The other two men, 22 and 32 years of age, received burns covering up to 90 % of their bodies and remain in extremely serious condition at nearby hospitals. A spokesperson at the plant near the town of Sosnovy Bor, west of the city of St. Petersburg, said that the explosion had been caused when production rules were violated. But the fact is that ECOMET-S has never abided by any rules and that, sadly, this accident was the inevitable result of the reckless operations that have been allowed to continue unchecked by state and national authorities despite appeals by environmental groups and local residents for activities at the plant to be suspended.

40|$|The {{world is}} facing {{increasing}} energy and {{global climate change}} problems. Facing future depletion of fossil fuels {{and the threat of}} increased temperatures on earth due to air pollution from the burning of fossil fuels, {{there is a need for}} a clean alternative. The Norwegian environmental organization The <b>Bellona</b> <b>Foundation</b> believes that hydrogen as an energy carrier coupled with hydrogen technology is the solution and the only road to a 0 -emissions society—a hydrogen society. Under the slogan, “From Talking to Walking the Hy-way,” Bellona is through their Hydrogen Project working to achieve this green society. In a case study of Bellona’s Hydrogen Project, this thesis aims to examine how Bellona communicates with the intended target groups within this project and how the organization perceives the communication process. As the slogan suggests, in order for the Hydrogen Project to be completely successful, Bellona has to not only inform people about the hydrogen solution but also convince them and get them to begin implementing hydrogen technology. This is conducted through a communication process. The communication process includes both internal and external activities and is divided into four stages: translation, strategy, channels and feedback. Through contrasting the communication process with science communication models, the need for an interactive, multi-directional approach that makes problematic the receiver and recognizes the receiver as an active participant in addition to adhering to the correlation between message and context of the receiver. The case study aims to look at how Bellona conducts and perceives the different stages in the communication process and find out whether Bellona recognizes these features in or adheres to these factors within the Hydrogen Project...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} a {{tremendous}} civil society presence at the UNFCCC negotiations. However, {{the extent to which}} they work strategically to influence the negotiations have varied. In this thesis, I consider the following research questions: 1) Which channels of influence are available for the Norwegian non-state actors into the UNFCCC negotiations from 2009 - 2014 ? 2) What type of strategies do these NGOs apply? 3) To what extent do they succeed in reaching their strategic goals? There is a growing academic literature on NGO influence in the climate negotiations, particularly looking at transnational networks. However, there is limited research on the Norwegian civil society specifically, that sheds light on their efforts to influence the international negotiations. The ambition of this thesis is therefore to contribute to the academic debate from this angle. In order to allow that and increase the applicableness to further research, the analytical framework on NGO influence in environmental negotiations developed by Michele M. Betsill and Elisabeth Corell is applied. In this qualitative case study three different type of Norwegian non-state actors were chosen: a) a membership based activist environmental NGO, the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature; b) an intellectually based advisory environmental NGO, <b>Bellona</b> <b>Foundation</b> and; c) a lobbyist business NGO that represents an important sector in the national economy, Norwegian Shipowners' Association. Based on informant interviews, document analysis, fieldwork, and former research, I find that these organisations apply a wide repertoire of strategies in order to influence various policy levels with an implication for the UNFCCC negotiations. Although the thesis started with a pessimistic perspective, through the empirical data and analysis, I conclude that there are in fact evidence of influence – at times quite significantly so...|$|E
