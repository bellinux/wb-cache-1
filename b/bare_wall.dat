2500|$|The video {{begins with}} Gomez lying seductively on a bright, lime-green, velvet couch; wearing a loosely tied, robe-like fuchsia dress, [...] her eyes look sad {{and she is}} {{seemingly}} awaiting the arrival of her partner. Gomez wears a [...] floral, pink and lavender dress. The video then alternates between scenes of Gomez writhing around on a hardwood floor in ripped denim and a white T-shirt. In the next scene, Gomez [...] undresses and takes a shower in slow-motion; though not explicitly nude, the scene focuses {{on her head and}} shoulders. Gomez is later depicted towering over a camera in a warehouse, before returning to scenes of her writhing around and expressing her inner longing. Gomez is also pictured with wet hair, sitting on a bar stool against a <b>bare</b> <b>wall,</b> wearing a wet white T-shirt; imagery reminiscent of single's cover art. It then alternates between a scene in which she wallows on an old-fashioned leather couch wearing a silk dress. Throughout the video, Gomez is pictured singing for the camera, often making direct eye contact with the viewer and seemingly lost in deep thought.|$|E

2500|$|Gomez {{revealed}} the artwork {{for the single}} on June 19, 2015. On it, she is seen striking a risqué pose, on a bar stool against a <b>bare</b> <b>wall.</b> The singer sports a natural look in the artwork; barefoot and wearing only an oversized, thin white T-shirt as she runs her hands through her hair. Jonathan Borge of InStyle opined that the cover art was enough to cause excitement on its own. Eric Diep from Complex said Gomez [...] "slays the cover artwork" [...] and felt it implied her upcoming album would substantiate her maturity as an artist. Idolator's Mike Wass opined that the artwork was a good look for Gomez which manifested maturity, and {{said that it was}} [...] "yet another indication that the next phase of her career will come as something of a shock to long-term fans". Laura Beck of Cosmopolitan called the cover art [...] "insanely sexy" [...] and [...] "gorgeous", and added: [...] "All this lady needs to look amazing is a T-shirt and a stool. Impressive". Wass, Corrine Heller of E! and Amanda Bell of MTV News all commended Gomez's sex appeal in the cover art, while other critics complimented the artwork's beauty and simplicity.|$|E

The quaint figure, in its belaced frock, quilted petticoat, and red-heeled shoes, seemed to come tripping toward her in such a life-like way, that she almost saw the curls blow back, heard the rustle of the rich brocade, and caught the sparkle of the little maid's bright eyes.|$|E
60|$|The moon shone fitfully {{through the}} clouds on to the weary face of Brother Jasper {{kneeling}} in his cell.

All through the hours of night, while the monks were sleeping, Brother Jasper had been supplicating his God for light; but in his soul remained a darkness deeper {{than that of the}} blackest night. At last he heard the tinkling of the bell that called the monks to prayers, and with a groan lifted himself up. He opened his cell door and went out into the cloister. With down-turned face he walked along till he came to the chapel, and, reaching his seat, sank again heavily to his knees.|$|E
60|$|He did {{not think}} of {{shooting}} at the Piutes; they, however, recovering from their shock, evidently feared the ambush, for they swiftly drew up the slope and passed out of sight.

Hundreds of feet below he saw dark growths of pinyons. There was no sign of a pile of horses and men, and then he realized that he could not tell the number that had perished. The swift finale had been as stunning to him as if lightning had struck near him.|$|E

60|$|The mysterious Nubian doorkeeper {{admitted}} the guests {{through the same}} narrow passages, much to the disgust of Lady Pyle and the discomfiture of her paunchy husband; but on reaching a large circular interior hall, a greater surprise was in store for them. It {{was found that the}} only entrance to the body of the hall was along a narrow ledge against the <b>bare</b> <b>wall</b> some distance from the floor, which obliged the guests to walk slowly, in single file, along this precarious strip, giving them the attitudes of an Egyptian frieze, which was suggested in the original plaster above them. It is needless to say that, while the effect was ingenious and striking from the centre of the room, where the Princess stood with a few personal friends, it was exceedingly uncomfortable to the figures themselves, in their enforced march along the ledge,--especially a figure of Sir Midas Pyle's proportions. Suddenly an exclamation broke from the doctor.|$|E
60|$|If we can {{comprehend}} clearly {{how things}} operate upon {{one of our}} senses, there can be very little difficulty in conceiving in what manner they affect the rest. To say a great deal therefore upon the corresponding affections of every sense, would tend rather to fatigue us by an useless repetition, than to throw any new light upon the subject by that ample and diffuse manner of treating it; but as in this discourse we chiefly attach ourselves to the sublime, as it affects the eye, we shall consider particularly why a successive disposition of uniform parts in the same right line should be sublime,[36] and upon what principle this disposition is enabled to make a comparatively small quantity of matter produce a grander effect, than a much larger quantity disposed in another manner. To avoid the perplexity of general notions; let us set before our eyes, a colonnade of uniform pillars planted in a right line; let us take our stand in such a manner, that the eye may shoot along this colonnade, for it has its best effect in this view. In our present situation it is plain, that the rays from the first round pillar will cause in the eye a vibration of that species; {{an image of the}} pillar itself. The pillar immediately succeeding increases it; that which follows renews and enforces the impression; each in its order as it succeeds, repeats impulse after impulse, and stroke after stroke, until the eye, long exercised in one particular way, cannot lose that object immediately, and, being violently roused by this continued agitation, it presents the mind with a grand or sublime conception. But instead of viewing a rank of uniform pillars, let us suppose that they succeed each other, a round and a square one alternately. In this case the vibration caused by the first round pillar perishes as soon as it is formed; and one of quite another sort (the square) directly occupies its place; which however it resigns as quickly to the round one; and thus the eye proceeds, alternately, taking up one image, and laying down another, as long as the building continues. From whence it is obvious that, at the last pillar, the impression is as far from continuing as it was at the very first; because, in fact, the sensory can receive no distinct impression but from the last; and it can never of itself resume a dissimilar impression: besides every variation of the object is a rest and relaxation to the organs of sight; and these reliefs prevent that powerful emotion so necessary to produce the sublime. To produce therefore a perfect grandeur in such things as we have been mentioning, there should be a perfect simplicity, an absolute uniformity in disposition, shape, and coloring. Upon this principle of succession and uniformity it may be asked, why a long <b>bare</b> <b>wall</b> should not be a more sublime object than a colonnade; since the succession is no way interrupted; since the eye meets no check; since nothing more uniform can be conceived? A long <b>bare</b> <b>wall</b> is certainly not so grand an object as a colonnade of the same length and height. It is not altogether difficult to account for this difference. When we look at a naked wall, from the evenness of the object, the eye runs along its whole space, and arrives quickly at its termination; the eye meets nothing which may interrupt its progress; but then it meets nothing which may detain it a proper time to produce a very great and lasting effect. The view of a <b>bare</b> <b>wall,</b> if it be of a great height and length, is undoubtedly grand; but this is only one idea, and not a repetition of similar ideas: it is therefore great, not so much upon the principle of infinity, as upon that of vastness. But we are not so powerfully affected with any one impulse, unless it be one of a prodigious force indeed, as we are with a succession of similar impulses; because the nerves of the sensory do not (if I may use the expression) acquire a habit of repeating the same feeling in such a manner as to continue it longer than its cause is in action; besides, all the effects which I have attributed to expectation and surprise in Sect. 11, can have no place in a <b>bare</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|E
60|$|By this time, Peter, {{being as}} {{determined}} as Fate and as diligent as Time, {{had made an}} end with the uppermost regions, and got down to the second story, where he was busy {{in one of the}} front chambers.

There were remnants of faded and tattered paper-hangings, but larger spaces of <b>bare</b> <b>wall</b> ornamented with charcoal sketches, chiefly of people's heads in profile. These being specimens of Peter's youthful genius, it went more to his heart to obliterate them than if they had been pictures on a church wall by Michael Angelo. One sketch, however, and that the best one, affected him differently. It represented a ragged man, partly supporting himself on a spade, and bending his lean body over a hole in the earth, with one hand extended to grasp something that he had found. But close behind him, with a fiendish laugh on his features, appeared a figure with horns, a tufted tail, and a cloven hoof.|$|E
