40|$|AbstractMicrofabricated silicon {{cantilever}} sensor arrays {{represent a}} powerful platform for sensing applications in physics, chemistry, material science, biology and medicine. The sensor response is mechanical <b>bending</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> absorption of molecules. In gaseous environment, polymer-coated microcantilevers {{are used as}} electronic nose for characterization of vapors, resulting in cantilever <b>bending</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> polymer swelling upon exposure. Medical applications involve fast characterization of exhaled patient's breath samples for detection of diseases, based {{on the presence of}} certain chemicals in breath. We present a portable, compact, modular microcantilever setup, which uses a micropump for aspiration and a bluetooth interface for remote data acquisition...|$|R

5000|$|The name is {{from the}} Welsh 'pwll coch' which means 'red pool'. The 'Pwll Coch' was {{originally}} a pool in the river Ely that supposedly filled with blood following the Battle of St Fagans in 1648. <b>Due</b> <b>to</b> <b>straightening</b> of the river's course (the 'new cut') the pool no longer exists. Ysgol Gymraeg Pwll Coch, a Welsh-medium primary school in the nearby Leckwith district of Canton, is also named after the pool.|$|R
50|$|Thermometers {{are another}} {{application}} of thermal expansion - most contain a liquid (usually mercury or alcohol) which is constrained to flow {{in only one}} direction (along the tube) <b>due</b> <b>to</b> changes in volume brought about by changes in temperature. A bi-metal mechanical thermometer uses a bimetallic strip and <b>bends</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the differing thermal expansion of the two metals.|$|R
50|$|A guitar neck {{made of wood}} {{is prone}} <b>to</b> <b>bending</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> mainly two factors: 1.) {{atmospheric}} changes, and 2.) the pull created by changing to a different gauge of guitar strings. A truss rod keeps the neck straight by countering {{the pull of the}} strings and natural tendencies in the wood.|$|R
50|$|Wood {{is strong}} in tension and compression, {{but can be}} weak in <b>bending</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> its fibrous structure. Wood is {{relatively}} good in fire as it chars, which provides the wood in {{the centre of the}} element with some protection and allows the structure to retain some strength for a reasonable length of time.|$|R
50|$|Causing spoons, keys, {{and other}} items to appear to bend without any {{physical}} force is a common stage magic trick that has many variants. Simply holding a spoon by its neck and rapidly tilting {{it back and forth}} can create the illusion that the spoon is <b>bending,</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the way that the human eye perceives the rocking motion.|$|R
50|$|A {{disadvantage}} of BGAs {{is that the}} solder balls cannot flex {{in the way that}} longer leads can, so they are not mechanically compliant. As with all surface mount devices, <b>bending</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> a difference in coefficient of thermal expansion between PCB substrate and BGA (thermal stress) or flexing and vibration (mechanical stress) can cause the solder joints to fracture.|$|R

In this case report, we present an interest-ing case of the coronary accordion effect observed in a 52 -year-old woman undergoing PCI. Key words: accordion effect, coronary intervention.

50|$|In the {{studded tyre}} class {{there is no}} broadsiding around the <b>bends</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the grip {{produced}} by the spikes digging into the ice. Instead, riders lean their bikes into the bends at an angle where the handlebars just skim the track surface. This riding style {{is different from that}} used in the other track racing disciplines. This means riders from this discipline rarely participate in Speedway or its other variants and vice versa.|$|R
40|$|Novel sensors {{based on}} bending and {{resonance}} frequency changes of (coated silicon) microcantilevers are discussed. Adsorption-induced resonance frequency changes of microcantilevers can be <b>due</b> <b>to</b> {{a combination of}} mass loading and change of spring constant resulting from adsorption of chemicals on the surface. Cantilevers also undergo static <b>bending</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> adsorption-induced differential surface stress if the adsorption is confined to one surface. Hence cantilever deflection as well as resonance frequency change {{can be used as}} the basis for development of novel chemcal sensors...|$|R
40|$|Two {{top class}} cyclists, 23 and 24, complained of {{intermittent}} acute claudica-tion at maximal effort <b>due</b> <b>to</b> a stenotic endofibrosis {{of the external}} iliac artery. Symptoms disappeared after endarterectomy and venous patch arterioplasty. This pathology is probably the consequence of repeated and long continued haemodynamic stress acting on the external iliac artery which would be respon-sible, in certain subjects, for an exaggerated <b>bend</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the sitting position of the competitor. High cardiac output and adaptive hypertension must also be of importance...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} the <b>bending</b> curvature <b>due</b> <b>to</b> self-weight of tie-rods when using dynamical approach to identify the tensile force in tie-rods of historical constructions. Although several dynamic testing methods have been proposed in the literature, the effect of <b>bending</b> curvature <b>due</b> <b>to</b> self-weight of the rods on their frequency values has not been studied. In this work, the <b>bending</b> curvature <b>due</b> <b>to</b> self-weight of tie-rods with small cross-section-to-length ratios is proven to have significant effect on their frequency values of the first vibration mode at low tensile stresses. As a result, the accuracy of the identified tensile force in tie-rods will be affected if the effect is not accurately considered. Four tie-rod specimens of different characteristics were tested in laboratory by dynamic tests. A numerical model was developed for axially loaded tie-rod using a FE program, assuming Euler beam with uniform cross-section and rotational springs at both supports. By calibrating the experimental and numerical results, the most suitable dynamical analysis for tie-rod models {{to take into account the}} effect of <b>bending</b> curvature <b>due</b> <b>to</b> their self-weights is concluded. In particular, the analysis should be performed in two steps: (i) first, the static geometric non-linear analysis to obtain the deflected shape of the tie-rod <b>due</b> <b>to</b> its self-weight and an applied tensile force; (ii) then, the modal analysis is run on the deflected tie-rod to achieve the frequencies and mode shapes via free vibration at that applied tensile force. When the effect of <b>bending</b> curvature <b>due</b> <b>to</b> self-weight of tie-rods is neglected, the frequency of the first mode should be excluded. Based on these conclusions, two techniques to identify in-situ the tensile stress in tie-rods are discussed. They are frequency-based identification techniques that minimize the measurement errors. In addition, a methodology to estimate a range of tensile stress using a formula or two self-constructed standard charts is proposed...|$|R

A cantilever made of LCE-CNTs exposed to light demonstrates dynamic <b>bending</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> inhomogeneous strain distribution caused by exponential heat generation across the cantilever width.
