50|$|The Labour councils in old {{metropolitan}} {{counties of}} West Midlands, South Yorkshire, Greater London, and Greater Manchester {{led the way}} in developing interventionist economic policies. In these metropolitan county areas, Inward Investment Agencies, Enterprise Boards, Low Pay Units, and Co-operative Development Agencies proliferated, while parts of the country such as Salford Quays and Cardiff Bay were redeveloped. The Labour council in Birmingham in the 1980s worked to diversify the <b>business</b> <b>visitor</b> economy, as characterised by the decision to build a new, purpose-built convention centre in a decaying, inner-city district around Broad Street. By the mid-1990s, the success of this strategy was evident by the success of the International convention centre leading to wider redevelopment, as characterised by the building of a Sea Life Centre, the National Indoor Arena, bars, hotels, and thousands of newly constructed and refurbished flats and houses. This helped to revitalise the city centre and brought in people and money to both and the city and the West Midlands region as a whole.|$|E
50|$|Poirot and Hastings are {{entertaining}} Japp {{after they}} had all attended a magic show when the conversation turns to the recent disappearance of a banker, Mr. Davenheim, from his large country house, the Cedars. Boasting, Poirot makes a five-pound bet with Japp that he could solve the case within a week without moving from his chair. The {{facts of the case}} are that Davenheim arrived home from the city at midday on Saturday. He seemed normal and went out to post some letters late in the afternoon saying that he was expecting a <b>business</b> <b>visitor,</b> a Mr. Lowen, who should be shown into the study to wait his return. Mr. Davenheim never did return and no trace of him can be found. The police were called on Sunday morning and on the Monday it was discovered that the concealed safe in Davenheim's study was forced open and the contents removed - cash, a large amount of bearer bonds and jewellery. Lowen has not been arrested, but is under observation. He was there to discuss some business in South Africa with Mr. Davenheim, who was in Johannesburg the previous autumn. Poirot is interested that the house has a boating lake, which Japp tells him is being searched tomorrow, and that Mr. Davenheim wears his hair rather long with a moustache and bushy beard. The next day Japp returns with the news that Davenheim's clothes have been found in the lake and that they have arrested Lowen. A common thief called Billy Kellett, known to the police for pick-pocketing, saw Lowen throw Davenheim's ring into a roadside ditch on the Saturday. He picked it up and pawned it in London, got drunk on the proceeds, got arrested and is in custody.|$|E
40|$|Trade {{shows have}} {{been the focus of}} recent {{research}} as constituting {{one of the most effective}} marketing strategies. Related issues have been discussed extensively in the literature. How to achieve better performance is central to these discussions. Studies on the key factors that influence trade show performance have focused mainly on subjective opinions from the perspective of the staff at exhibitions. In this study, we explored the key criteria for a <b>business</b> <b>visitor</b> in selecting suppliers at a trade show; that is, what kind of trade show strategies can promote exhibitors ’ performance? Trade show strategies from previous studies were first summarized. They were classified into three categories: before, at, and after the show. To address the problem of complexity and uncertainty, a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) was used to explore the importance of the various strategies. The results showed that "follow-up after the exhibition " was the most important factor from the perspective of business visitors. “Active invitation before the exhibition ” was considered to be the next most important issue in attracting business visitors at a trade show. Among at-show strategies, the most important was that of staff knowledge of the product and trade details. The results of this study could contribute to enhancing trade show performance...|$|E

40|$|Before the Torts Restatement, a {{licensee}} {{was usually}} {{thought of as}} a man who, for his own purposes only, had the occupier 2 ̆ 7 s bare permission to enter land. He was often called a 2 ̆ 2 bare, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 naked, 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 mere 2 ̆ 2 licensee, and stood between the trespasser on one hand and the invitee on the other. As a mere matter of language, however, the term 2 ̆ 2 licensee 2 ̆ 2 may be used appropriately to describe all those who enter land with the express or implied-in-fact consent of the occupier. This would include those entering to serve the occupier 2 ̆ 7 s interest alone, to serve an interest mutual to both occupier and entrant, or to serve the entrant 2 ̆ 7 s purposes only. It would include all those who had an invitation of one sort or another, {{as well as those who}} had nothing more than permission. The Restatenent chose this broad use of the term 2 ̆ 2 licensee. 2 ̆ 2 By doing so, it did not mean, however, to reject the familiar division between 2 ̆ 2 licensee 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 invitee 2 ̆ 2; rather it substituted the terms 2 ̆ 2 gratuitous licensee 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 <b>business</b> <b>visitor,</b> 2 ̆ 2 on the ground that these terms contained a more accurate reference to the proper basis for subdividing its broad licensee category. We shall use the older terminology, partly because it is still more familiar in the profession and partly because we disagree with the substantive grounds that impelled the use of the newer terms...|$|E
40|$|Regional {{economic}} integration {{is back in}} vogue following the "stumble" in the Doha Round in July 2008. Preferential trade agreements (PTAs) are driving this trend in Asia and the Pacific {{as well as in}} Central and South America, and the sheer volume of PTAs is striking. In the 1990 s there were barely five PTAs in force, but now there are more than 200 either under negotiation or in force. In this regard, Asia and the Pacific has developed a rapidly evolving regional economic architecture that spans two major plurilateral agreements, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (or ASEAN+ 6 RCEP), as well as the putative Free Trade Agreement of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP), which received {{a new lease on life}} through the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders' meeting in Beijing late last year. ASEAN, as a group or individually, has been particularly busy in this sphere, deliberately using PTAs as a supplement to its own regional integration process. In Central and Latin America, {{economic integration}} has been similarly pursued at variable speeds and in variable geometries. In the meantime, there have been some concerns about the proliferation of PTAs for all the usual reasons. Trade diversion is a reality and with their less-than-comprehensive approach to sensitive issues like agriculture and burdensome rules of origin (ROO), many PTAs are perceived as being at best of marginal business interest and at worst a "stumbling block" to conclusion of the Doha Development Round. This paper argues, however, that more recent PTA outcomes, like the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand FTA (AANZFTA) and the Malaysia-New Zealand FTA (MNZFTA) present a rather more nuanced picture. There may even be some grounds for modest optimism about how PTAs can be building - not stumbling - blocks for multilateralism. Four distinct criteria are used to assess the AANZFTA and the MNZFTA. These include: 1) the breadth and depth of agricultural market access liberalization; 2) the existence (or non-existence) of WTO-plus commitments; 3) how the risks of complex ROO, etc., are mitigated; and 4) the introduction of bespoke solutions of direct commercial value to business (e. g., facilitated <b>business</b> <b>visitor</b> access). The paper suggests that both the AANZFTA and the MNZFTA provide the basis for engagement at the WTO on how to multilateralize the outcomes secured through the AANZFTA and the MNZFTA. The role and experience of New Zealand in both of these high quality and comprehensive PTAs is something that may be of enduring interest...|$|E

40|$|Nature-based tourism {{can be an}} {{important}} source of income for regional economies, but relies on a healthy environment. Using data collected from <b>business</b> and non-business <b>visitors</b> to Australia's coast adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef, the authors generate estimates of the potential financial impact of environmental degradation, demonstrating a novel way of testing and controlling for hypothetical response bias. More than 90 % of non-business visitors and 67 % of <b>business</b> <b>visitors</b> came to the region for at least one nature-related reason. Average daily expenditure was similar for both visitor segments (about $ 190), but the determinants of expenditure varied. All visitors reacted much more negatively to the prospect of environmental degradation than to a 20 % increase in (local) prices, although <b>business</b> <b>visitors</b> were much less responsive than non-business visitors. Adjusting for hypothetical response bias, the authors estimate that substantial environmental degradation could reduce visitor expenditures (and thus local tourism incomes) by at least 17 %...|$|R
