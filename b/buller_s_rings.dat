Nous avons construit un goniomètre fait maison de haute qualité. Une série de trous unique percés dans un film opaque et variant continûment de k r >> 1 à k r > 1 to k r<< 1 {{in a flat}} opaque film were explored, where k is the wavevector of {{the incident}} wave and r is the radius of the hole. The experimental {{results indicated that the}} diffraction of single hole can be classified into four regimes, depending on the input polarization. A simple analytical expression reveals {{for the first time the}} subtle interplay of two competing factors: one related to surface plasmon excitation and the other originating in the coupling of the field to the waveguide mode of the aperture. When the hole is surrounded by concentric grooves (<b>bull</b> <b>s</b> eye structure) and is illuminated with the grooves on the output side, the beaming effect occurs: far-field diffraction is confined in very small solid angle. The effects of geometrical parameters on <b>bull</b> <b>s</b> eye diffraction have been studied and the diffraction patterns with the width less than 1 in the far field have been achieved. Another surface waves (CWs) different from SPs on tungsten films were studied. It was demonstrated that the CWs have beaming effect as well. By comparison we showed that CWs display much weaker enhancement in transmission than SPs through nanostructures. STRASBOURG-Bib. electronique 063 (674829902) / SudocSudocFranceF...|$|R
40|$|Two years ago, the centaur Chariklo was {{discovered}} {{to have two}} rings, which made it the first known minor planet to have a ring system. The uniqueness of this situation calls for an examination as to how a two-ring system can be sustained around a relatively small interplanetary object. We simulate, in 2 D and 3 D, a two-body system with solar radiation pressure forces perturbing a dust particle 2 ̆ 7 s orbit around a Chariklo-sized object. The lifetime of orbiting dust particles is estimated by integrating their orbits {{as a function of}} their size and initial position. Current results show that for a water-ice or silicate particle with radius of 100 micrometer, its simulated orbit lasts for only about 20 years. This short lifetime suggests that there may be additional forces keeping the ring particle in place, and/or the presence of active sources of these particles. It is also found that the dust particle 2 ̆ 7 s simulated orbital lifetime is longest when it is positioned where Chariklo 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rings</b> are located, which agrees with the observations already made of Chariklo 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ring</b> system.
