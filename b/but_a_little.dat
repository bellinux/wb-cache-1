5|$|Richard Vines, whilst {{writing for}} Bloomberg, advised readers {{to not be}} put off the hype; and while the courses are not as life {{changing}} as those served at The Fat Duck, there are stand out dishes such as the meat fruit and the tipsy cake. He {{also noted that the}} meat fruit was a favourite of Pierre Koffmann. Marina O'Loughlin visited the restaurant twice for the Metro newspaper, once just after opening and again several months later to compare how it had settled in. She thought it was a well-oiled operation, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too much so, and questioned the originality of it as a version of the meat fruit had previously been available at the restaurant Amber in another Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Hong Kong and little touches as the years of origin which appear next to the menu items have been used before by Marco Pierre White. Jan Moir for The Daily Mail thought that the ice cream trolley was a sensation, along with the meat fruit, but could not understand the reason behind recreating the salamagundy dish.|$|E
5|$|The canal passes {{along the}} {{south-western}} edge of Christleton, {{and through the}} centre of Waverton, {{where there is a}} large grade II listed mill building, which was once steam powered and includes bays in the right gable from which boats were loaded. The parish church is some distance from the main centre of population, {{on the edge of the}} flat Cheshire plain. The tall tower dates from the 16th century, and the roof of the nave is of hammer-beam construction, dating from 1635. There are several accommodation bridges on this section, all dating from the time of the construction of the canal, including Davies Bridge, Salmon's Bridge, and Faulkners Bridge, all built in orange brick and grade II listed structures. The railway line to Crewe follows the same general alignment as the canal, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> further to the south, as both follow the valley of the River Gowy. The canal crosses from the south bank of the river to the north bank on an aqueduct and continues eastwards, passing the massive ruined remains of Beeston Castle, which was built in the 1220s by the Earl of Chester on top of a steep hill, and dominates the countryside.|$|E

6000|$|... 'My {{desire is}} <b>but</b> for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> thing,' said the young Fisherman, 'yet hath the Priest been wroth with me, and driven me forth. It is <b>but</b> for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> thing, and the merchants have mocked at me, and denied me. Therefore am I come to thee, though men call thee evil, and {{whatever}} be thy price I shall pay it.' ...|$|R
5|$|The {{majuscule}} letters have elegant shape, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> less simple {{than those}} in the Sinaiticus and Vaticanus codices. These letters, {{at the end of a}} line, are often very small, and much of the writing is very pale and faint. Punctuation is more frequent, usually on a level with the top of the preceding letter, while a vacant space, proportionate to the break in the sense, follows the end of a paragraph. At the end of each book the colophon is ornamented by pretty volutes from prima manu. There are found the Ammonian Sections with references to the Eusebian Canons stand in the margin of the text of the Gospels. It contains divisions into larger sections – κεφάλαια, the headings of these sections (τίτλοι) stand at the top of the pages. The places at which those sections commence are indicated throughout the Gospels, and in Luke and John their numbers are placed in the margin of each column. To all the Gospels (except Matthew, because of lacunae) is prefixed by a table of κεφάλαια (table of contents).|$|E
25|$|In 408, {{after the}} death of Stilicho (August 22), he was {{appointed}} Magister peditum, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> later his office was given to the Magister equitum Turpilio. The following year he was again in Constantinople, where he probably had received the office of Magister militum praesentalis; on this occasion, he suppressed a popular revolt caused by a food shortage with the collaboration of Arsacius and Synesius.|$|E
25|$|Schur {{remained}} {{a member of}} the Prussian Academy of Sciences after his release as a professor, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> later he lost this last remnant of his official position. Due to an intervention from Bieberbach in the spring of 1938 he was forced to explain his resignation from the commission of the Academy. His membership in the Advisory Board of the Mathematical Journal was ended in early 1939.|$|E
60|$|Remember! But {{she said}} nothing. She raised {{her eyes for}} an instant. It was <b>but</b> <b>a</b> glance; <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> tearful, timid glance. It kept Joe silent though, for a long time.|$|R

25|$|When the lizards {{approach}} them, Nancy is fascinated <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> afraid. She remains {{close to}} Charlie. Though {{she does not}} agree with him, she does find him a small stick {{to use as a}} defense. It is Nancy who comes {{up with the idea of}} lying down in a submissive posture when Leslie and Sarah come near. Charlie follows Nancy's directions in most of the dealings with the lizards. After it becomes clear that the lizards will not harm them, Nancy is excited by their presence. She does everything she can to learn about them and make a connection with them. She wants to shake hands with them first.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1971, {{the group}} {{toyed with the}} idea of adding a second drummer, supplementing Hartman's {{drumming}} on some of their shows with that of Navy veteran Michael Hossack while still touring behind their first album. In October 1971, the band recorded several songs for their second album with Shogren on bass, guitar, and background vocals. <b>But</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> later, during the album's recording, Shogren left after disagreements with the group's new producer, Ted Templeman. Shogren was replaced in December 1971 with singer, songwriter and bass guitarist Tiran Porter, while Hossack was added to the lineup at the same time as a regular. Porter and Hossack were both stalwarts of the Northern California music scene, Porter having previously played in Scratch with Simmons. Porter brought a funkier bass style to the band and added his husky baritone to the voices of Johnston and Simmons, resulting in a rich three-part harmonic vocal blend.|$|E
25|$|Next {{to cross}} are the Doncaster to Gainsborough railway {{line and the}} B1396 road at Auckley Bridge. The Aldam Drain drains Cantley Low Common, and beyond the junction, the river becomes a high level carrier, with {{permanent}} embanking of both banks, and catchwater drains running along the foot of both banks. At Candy Farm there are two pumping stations, the southern one pumping the Black Bank Drain into the river, and the northern one pumping the East Ring Drain. At Tunnel Pits, there are two more pumping stations, and Tunnel Pits Bridge carries the road which follows Vermuyden's North Idle Drain over the channel. Soon, the South Engine Drain is running parallel to the river, as it crosses under Sandtoft Road and the M180 motorway. As it turns to the east again, the Folly Drain also runs parallel, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> beyond the A161 bridge, the two drains continue to the east, while the river diverts to the north, to run parallel to the North Engine Drain. The Hatfield Waste Drain runs parallel to the North Engine Drain on its south bank, but after the approach on the Torne, there was nowhere for it to go, and so it passes under the North Engine Drain to its north bank through a grade II listed syphon, which was probably built by Samual Foster in 1795 or by Thackray in 1813 {{as part of a}} series of improvements recommended by the engineer John Rennie.|$|E

25|$|Further {{settlement}} {{took place}} after Goodna was proclaimed {{a village in}} 1856. In the following year Joseph and Ellen (née Thompson) Broad built a store on the site, and sold the store later to Edwin Pitt, son of Charles and Mary Pitt. Edwin and his wife Cecilia (née Thompson sister of Ellen Broad) ran the store as a mixed business and Cecilia was the postmistress (see Aldines). They survived the 1893 Brisbane flood <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> later built Pitt's Hotel Cecil on the store site. It was later burnt down and the RSL is now on that site. Edwin and Cecilia's daughter Zora Brenda Pitt grew up and learnt to ride in Goodna and she became Royal National Show champion woman rider in the early 1900s, and the cemetery opened in 1859. By 1863 {{there was a small}} run to Holmes Inn, where Harriet Holmes was postmistress.The Congregational Church was also opened in 1863. It was built by Mr ES Thomas who was also the lay preacher. Mr Thomas was an Ipswich Councillor and the local JP. As a JP he also filled the role of acting magistrate on occasions. He built the now heritage listed house at 43 William Street and owned the adjacent general store and bakery. Mr Thomas originally operated a general store in Brisbane Road but this was flooded in 1893. They had to move their best things into {{the top floor of the}} nearby hotel. There was one acting police sergeant and a constable by 1868. W. Law established himself as a blacksmith in 1870, the year in which the Goodna State School opened.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} {{a parody of}} The Wonder Years, in which Bart stares into the distance after realizing {{that he has to}} get his first job, and an older version of Bart's voice is heard saying [...] "I didn't realize it at the time, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> piece of my childhood had slipped away forever." [...] Daniel Stern guest starred as the voice of the adult Bart, just like he did for the adult voice of the character Kevin in the television show The Wonder Years (he had also featured with Yeardley Smith in the movie City Slickers around the time this episode was produced).|$|E
500|$|Psilocybe aztecorum {{is still}} used ceremonially by the {{indigenous}} people of Oaxaca, and by Nahua people in the Popocatépetl region, although this usage is gradually diminishing. Traditional folk healers, or curanderos, maintain familiarity with psychoactive mushrooms (and other mind-altering plants used in ceremonial rituals), and diagnose illnesses by having the client ingest the mushrooms. One Mixe curandero [...] initiation ritual involves ingestion of mushrooms following a period of [...] "abstinence from talking, sexual intercourse, and all foods except nuts for three days, whereupon the individual goes up to a mountain, subsists on nothing <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> honey, and prays to God for the power to heal." ...|$|E

500|$|Hurricane Alberto {{began to}} weaken on August 22 as it {{accelerated}} into higher latitudes. It was downgraded to {{a tropical storm}} early on August 23. Initially, it was forecast to become extratropical on August 22, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> burst of colder cloud tops enabled Alberto to remain tropical for a longer time, persisting into August 23, while it moved into a very high latitude at 53˚N. [...] The weakening storm finally became extratropical late on August 23, while accelerating to the north-northeast, passing near Iceland on August 24. Winds dropped below gale-force, as the centre turned to the east-northeast on August 25. Alberto dissipated about 85mi (140km) east of Jan Mayen later that day.|$|E
500|$|Arriving at Wessagusset, Standish {{found that}} many of the Englishmen had gone to live with the Massachusetts, and he ordered them to be called back to Wessagusset. [...] Pecksuot was a Massachusett warrior and leader of the group {{threatening}} Wessagusset; he came to the settlement with Wituwamat and other warriors the day after Standish's arrival. [...] Standish claimed simply to be in Wessagusset on a trading mission, but Pecksuot said to Hobbamock, [...] "Let him begin when he dare... he shall not take us unawares." [...] Later in the day, Pecksuot approached Standish, looking down on him, and said, [...] "You are a great captain, yet you are <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> man. Though I be no sachem, yet I am of great strength and courage." ...|$|E
500|$|Leane {{returned}} to the 48th on 22 May and reverted in rank, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> over a week later he was substantively promoted to colonel and temporarily promoted to brigadier general to command the 12th Brigade, as Gellibrand had been promoted to major general and appointed to command the 3rd Division. For his [...] "considerable skill and ability" [...] while acting brigade commander, he was recommended for the award of the French Croix de guerre, and was mentioned in despatches for the sixth time. Immediately before his assumption of command, {{the limited number of}} reinforcements available, combined with losses suffered by the 12th Brigade at Dernancourt and Monument Wood necessitated the disbandment of one of the battalions of the brigade, and the 47th Battalion was chosen. Between 25 and 27 May its manpower was divided equally between the other battalions of the brigade.|$|E

500|$|Fragile Allegiance was {{generally}} well received, achieving average to good scores from reviewers. It was praised for its graphics and icon driven interface which was considered slick and well integrated <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> confusing at first. Reviewers noted that after {{figuring out what}} all the icons did the game was immensely engrossing, with the player always having something to do. The game was criticised for its difficulty, its simplistic combat model, the time spent transporting ore between asteroids, and {{the large amount of}} micromanagement involved when the player's empire got large — although reviewers noted that the latter two could be countered by the [...] "Ore Teleporter blueprint" [...] and Colony Supervisors respectively. There were mixed feelings regarding the replacing of research with the Sci-Tek blueprint system, which meant that any blueprint could be bought in any order provided the player had the money to do so.|$|E
500|$|In August 2015, Cornell openly said in {{interview}} with Total Guitar {{that he was}} quite eager to reunite with Audioslave: [...] "I {{think it would be}} great. We did a lot of songs, and with the benefit of not having done anything with those guys for so long, I can't imagine what it would be. It would be a really amazing experience just to get back and work with the same guys again." [...] Soon after, Morello said that he's interested in working with Cornell again, remembering their 2014 Seattle performance with great fondness: [...] "I love Chris and consider him a great friend. The Hall of Fame jam was nice, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> chaotic. Playing with him in Seattle, that was just fantastic. I love that guy. He's one of the most talented vocalists in the history of vocalists. And {{to be able to play}} the songs that we wrote together, it was awesome and so much fun. I hope we do something like that again." ...|$|E
500|$|Watson {{wrote that}} [...] "the chief joy [...] was the {{stealthy}} way the atmospheric story was built up layer by layer". In The Times, Billen described [...] "Sardines" [...] as [...] "a disciplined comedy, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of discipline, {{as one of}} the League's perverts might say, never did anyone any harm". With the exception of the ending, Billen [...] "loved it". A separate review in The Times, however, praised the twist ending; [...] "this isn't just an inspired set-up performed by a stellar cast – it builds to a macabre and horribly imagined climax." [...] Owen was ambivalent about the ending of [...] "Sardines", saying that it [...] "worked very well in terms of narrative, but perhaps it landed with too much softness". Mark Jones, writing in The Guardian, gave a more mixed review overall, describing [...] "Sardines" [...] as a [...] "slow burner, but a decent introduction to a series". Newsome called the episode a [...] "gem of an opener".|$|E
