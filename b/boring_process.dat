This paper presents the study of building a neural network model for predicting the behavior of a <b>boring</b> <b>process</b> during its full life cycle. This prediction is achieved by the fusion of the predictions of three principal components extracted as features from the joint time–frequency distributions of energy of the spindle loads observed during the <b>boring</b> <b>process.</b> Furthermore, prediction uncertainty is assessed using nonlinear regression in order to quantify the errors associated with the prediction.

40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of {{vibrations}} on the electrical discharges in the micro-EDM (electrical discharge machining) process was investigated. The electrical discharge machining of micro bores was chosen to represent a typical application. Using sophisticated measuring equipment to record and analyse current and voltage waveforms as well as electrode feeding during the process, deeper insight into the discharge mechanisms was achieved. It was found, that the micro-EDM <b>boring</b> <b>process</b> can be subdivided into three major parts, the start-up process, the major <b>boring</b> <b>process</b> and the workpiece breakthrough of the tool electrode.

40|$|In macro-tidal estuaries, a {{tidal bore}} may form during spring tide {{conditions}} when the flood tide {{is confined to}} a narrow channel. Most field occurrences showed well-defined undulations behind the leading wave, that is an undular <b>bore</b> <b>process.</b> Herein detailed free-surface and turbulence measurements were performed beneath undular bore fronts using side-looking acoustic Doppler velocimetry and non-intrusive free-surface measurement devices in a laboratory channel. Undular bores were observed for Froude numbers less than 1. 7 which compared favourably with past studies. Velocity measurements with a temporal resolution of 50 Hz showed a marked effect of the bore passage. Longitudinal velocities were characterised by rapid flow deceleration at all vertical elevations, while large fluctuations of transverse velocities were recorded beneath the front.

40|$|A {{tidal bore}} is a {{sharp rise in}} free-surface {{elevation}} propagating upstream in an estuarine system {{at the leading edge}} of the flood tide. It generates a powerful noise that was sometimes compared to the sounds of a horse cavalcade. Herein the sounds generated by a tidal bore event in the Baie du Mont Saint Michel were carefully recorded. The data showed three distinct periods. These were the incoming tidal bore when the sound amplitude increased with the approaching bore front, the passage of the tidal bore in front of the microphone where the impacts of the bore on the bank, rocks or jetty generated powerful noises, and the upstream propagation of the bore when the flood flow motion caused additional loud noises. During the arrival of the tidal bore, the sound levels were less energetic and a lower pitch sound was noted than during the subsequent record. For the breaking <b>bore</b> <b>process,</b> the analysis of the sound record indicated a dominant frequency around 76 - 77 Hz. The low pitch rumble had a frequency comparable the collective bubble oscillations, suggesting that air entrapment in the bore roller might play a major role in the acoustic signature...|$|R
40|$|A {{tidal bore}} may {{occur in a}} macro-tidal estuary when the tidal range exceeds 4. 5 - 6 m and the estuary {{bathymetry}} amplifies the tidal wave. Its upstream propagation induces a strong mixing of the estuarine waters. The propagation of undular tidal bores was investigated herein to study the effect of bridge piers on the bore propagation and characteristics. Both the tidal bore profile and the turbulence generated by the bore were recorded. The free-surface undulation profiles exhibited a quasi-periodic shape, and the potential energy of the undulations represented up to 30 % of the potential energy of the tidal bore. The presence of the channel constriction had {{a major impact on}} the free-surface properties. The undular tidal bore lost nearly one third of its potential energy per surface area as it propagated through the channel constriction. The detailed instantaneous velocity measurements showed a marked effect of the tidal bore passage suggesting the upstream advection of energetic events and vorticity "clouds" behind the bore front in both channel configurations: prismatic and with constriction. The turbulence patches were linked to some secondary motions and the proposed mechanisms were consistent with some field observations in the Daly River tidal bore. The findings emphasise the strong mixing induced by the tidal <b>bore</b> <b>processes,</b> and the impact of bridge structures on the phenomenon. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B. V...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{coupling}} between thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical (THMC) processes in reservoir rocks and seals will enhance {{our ability to}} characterize and predict reservoir behaviour. The coupling between these processes inside a reservoir occurs at various length- and time-scales. However, {{the coupling}} is not equally tight at every scale and depends on lithology as well. At the borehole-scale coupled THMC processes manifest as time-dependent borehole failure. Although intrinsic mechanical processes (i. e. creep) can explain some time-dependent failure, it is widely recognised that pressure, temperature and chemical gradients introduced by the drilling mud into the formation play an important role. In these instances equilibration of the gradients is achieved via a diffusion process and the coupling to the mechanical behaviour of the rock either results from a strain (i. e. “swelling” and “shrinking”) or a change in rock strength. The {{problem is that the}} exact interaction between these thermodynamic gradients and their associated mechanical failure processes are not well known, because (a) the impact of thermodynamic gradients is not routinely considered in rock mechanical testing and (b) repeat or “time-lapse” runs of borehole imaging tools over the same formation interval are rare. In this contribution we present a fully coupled material model that allows for diffusion-driven weakening and strain. The material model is based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics and the material weakening is achieved via a damage tensor. This material model is implemented into a Finite Element simulation of near-well <b>bore</b> <b>processes.</b> Apart from improving borehole stability predictions (the forward problem), such numerical simulations enable us to study the influence of the individual coupling parameters. We therefore conducted a parameter study that explores the feasibility of using in-situ observations (e. g. time-dependent widening of borehole breakouts in repeat image logs) for the inversion of THMC coupling parameters. We will show that a complete inversion for the most general formulation is not possible due to non-uniqueness of the problem. However we can constrain the type and tightness of coupling mechanisms and thereby improve modelling of wellbore stability...|$|R
