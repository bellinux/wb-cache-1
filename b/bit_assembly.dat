At 2:30 p.m. drilling was stopped again as the operation damaged the outer cutting bits and a new <b>bit</b> <b>assembly</b> was needed. At 3:30 a.m. {{a decision was made}} to change to a 26 in bit since there was one available 7 mi south of the mine in Somerset, PA, and it would accommodate the rescue capsule.

40|$|Abstract—The {{goal of the}} Mars 2020 {{mission is}} to acquire up to 28 rock/regolith samples and 3 blanks (or 34 rock/regolith samples and 3 blanks), and cache these for the future sample return mission. Honeybee Robotics {{investigated}} three architectures; however only two showed promise. In the One Bit One Core (OBOC) architecture, individual drill bits with core samples are cached. This is the least complex architecture and results in the total mass (cache+bits+rocks) of less than 2 kg and Orbital Sample diameter of 19 cm for the 31 cores case and slightly more (< 2. 4 kg cache and 20 cm OS) for the 37 cores. In the One Breakoff System One Core (OBSOC) architecture, the breakoff tube and the sleeve with cores are removed from the drill bit and cached. The architecture also uses one time use <b>bit</b> <b>assemblies</b> (plus spares). This architecture results in the lowest cache mass and OS diameter but the trad...|$|R
40|$|The Drill for the Mars Science Laboratory {{mission is}} a rotary-percussive sample {{acquisition}} device {{with an emphasis}} on toughness and robustness to handle the harsh environment on Mars. The unique challenges associated with autonomous drilling from a mobile robot are addressed. A highly compressed development schedule dictated a modular design architecture that satisfies the functional and load requirements while allowing independent development and testing of the Drill subassemblies. The Drill consists of four actuated mechanisms: a spindle that rotates the bit, a chuck that releases and engages bits, a novel voice-coil-based percussion mechanism that hammers the bit, and a linear translation mechanism. The Drill has three passive mechanisms: a replaceable <b>bit</b> <b>assembly</b> that acquires and collects sample, a contact sensor / stabilizer mechanism, and, lastly a flex harness service loop.

The thesis begins by providing an overview of the BitBox and then moves into detailing the design of the components. Then a presentation of the finite element analysis utilized to refine the design is discussed. Finally, the thesis provides an overview of the operation of the BitBox and its interaction with the MSL Rover's robotic arm. The resulting design proved to be very functional, and two BitBoxes were implemented rather than one as originally planned. Variations of the BitBox design could be used for other rover missions that utilize a robotic arm, both on terrestrial planets as well as in deep-sea operations...|$|E
40|$|A self contained, mobile {{drilling}} and coring system {{was designed to}} operate on the Lunar surface and be controlled remotely from earth. The system uses SKITTER (Spatial Kinematic Inertial Translatory Tripod Extremity Robot) as its foundation and produces Lunar core samples two meters long and fifty millimeters in diameter. The drill bit used for this is composed of 30 per carat diamonds in a sintered tungsten carbide matrix. To drill up to 50 m depths, the <b>bit</b> <b>assembly</b> will be attached to a drill string made from 2 m rods which will be carried in racks on SKITTER. Rotary power for drilling will be supplied by a Curvo-Synchronous motor. SKITTER is to support this system through a hexagonal shaped structure which will contain the drill motor and the power supply. A micro-coring drill {{will be used to}} remove a preliminary sample 5 mm in diameter and 20 mm long {{from the side of the}} core. This whole system is to be controlled from earth. This is carried out by a continuously monitoring PLC onboard the drill rig.

40|$|This drill (see Figure 1) is {{the primary}} sample {{acquisition}} element of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) that collects powdered samples from various types of rock (from clays to massive basalts) at depths up to 50 mm below the surface. A rotary-percussive sample acquisition device was developed {{with an emphasis on}} toughness and robustness to handle the harsh environment on Mars. It is the first rover-based sample acquisition device to be flight-qualified (see Figure 2). This drill features an autonomous tool change-out on a mobile robot, and novel voice-coil-based percussion. The drill comprises seven subelements. Starting {{at the end of the}} drill, there is a <b>bit</b> <b>assembly</b> that cuts the rock and collects the sample. Supporting the bit is a subassembly comprising a chuck mechanism to engage and release the new and worn bits, respectively, and a spindle mechanism to rotate the bit. Just aft of that is a percussion mechanism, which generates hammer blows to break the rock and create the dynamic environment used to flow the powdered sample. These components are mounted to a translation mechanism, which provides linear motion and senses weight-on-bit with a force sensor. There is a passive-contact sensor/stabilizer mechanism that secures the drill fs position on the rock surface, and flex harness management hardware to provide the power and signals to the translating components. The drill housing serves as the primary structure of the turret, to which the additional tools and instruments are attached. The drill <b>bit</b> <b>assembly</b> (DBA) is a passive device that is rotated and hammered in order to cut rock (i. e. science targets) and collect the cuttings (powder) in a sample chamber until ready for transfer to the CHIMRA (Collection and Handling for Interior Martian Rock Analysis). The DBA consists of a 5 / 8 -in. (. 1. 6 - cm) commercial hammer drill bit whose shank has been turned down and machined with deep flutes designed for aggressive cutting removal. Surrounding the shank of the bit is a thick-walled maraging steel collection tube allowing the powdered sample to be augured up the hole into the sample chamber. For robustness, the wall thickness of the DBA was maximized while still ensuring effective sample collection. There are four recesses in the bit tube that are used to retain the fresh bits in their bit box. The rotating bit is supported by a back-to-back duplex bearing pair within a housing that is connected to the outer DBA housing by two titanium diaphragms. The only bearings on the drill in the sample flow are protected by a spring-energized seal, and an integrated shield that diverts the ingested powdered sample from the moving interface. The DBA diaphragms provide radial constraint of the rotating bit and form the sample chambers. Between the diaphragms there is a sample exit tube from which the sample is transferred to the CHIMRA. To ensure that the entire collected sample is retained, no matter the orientation of the drill with respect to gravity during sampling, the pass-through from the forward to the aft chamber resides opposite to the exit tube...|$|E
40|$|Sampling cores {{requires}} the controlled breakoff {{of the core}} at a known location {{with respect to the}} drill end. An additional problem is designing a mechanism that can be implemented at a small scale that is robust and versatile enough to be used for a variety of core samples. This design consists of a set of tubes (a drill tube and an inner tube) and a rolling element (rolling tooth). An additional tube {{can be used as a}} sample tube. The drill tube and the inner tube have longitudinal holes with the axes offset from the axis of each tube. The two eccentricities are equal. The inner tube fits inside the drill tube, and the sample tube fits inside the inner tube. While drilling, the two tubes are positioned relative to each other such that the sample tube is aligned with the drill tube axis and core. The drill tube includes teeth and flutes for cuttings removal. The inner tube includes, at the base, the rolling element implemented as a wheel on a shaft in an eccentric slot. An additional slot in the inner tube and a pin in the drill tube limit the relative motion of the two tubes. While drilling, the drill assembly rotates relative to the core and forces the rolling tooth to stay hidden in the slot along the inner tube wall. When the drilling depth has been reached, the drill <b>bit</b> <b>assembly</b> is rotated in the opposite direction, and the rolling tooth is engaged and penetrates into the core. Depending on the strength of the created core, the rolling tooth can score, lock the inner tube relative to the core, start the eccentric motion of the inner tube, and break the core. The tooth and the relative position of the two tubes can act as a core catcher or core-retention mechanism as well. The design was made to fit the core and hole parameters produced by an existing bit; the parts were fabricated and a series of demonstration tests were performed. This invention is potentially applicable to sample return and in situ missions to planets such as Mars and Venus, to moons such as Titan and Europa, and to comets. It is also applicable to terrestrial applications like forensic sampling and geological sampling in the field...|$|E
40|$|In his {{keynote speech}} at CHES 2004, Kocher {{advocated}} that sidechannel attacks were an illustration that formal cryptography {{was not as}} secure as it was believed because some assumptions (e. g., no auxiliary information is available during the computation) were not modeled. This failure {{is due to the}} fact that formal methods work with models rather than implementations. Of course, we can use formal methods to prove non-functional security properties such as the absence of side-channel leakages. But a common obstacle is that those properties are very low-level and appear incompatible with formalization. To avoid the discrepancy between the model and the implementation, we apply formal methods directly on the implementation. Doing so, we can formally prove that an assembly code is leak-free, provided that the hardware it runs on satisfies a finite (and limited) set of properties that we show are realistic. We apply this technique to prove that a present implementation in 8 <b>bit</b> AVR <b>assembly</b> code is leak-free...|$|R

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this effort is to develop, build and test a high-speed drilling motor that can meet the performance guidelines of the announcement, namely: 'The motors are expected to rotate at a minimum of 10, 000 rpm, have an OD no larger than 7 inches and work downhole continuously for at least 100 hours.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Drilling, {{the act of}} {{creating}} a hole by removing material with a drill gloss tool is also {{carried out in the}} petroleum industry, but this is done {{with the aid of a}} drilling rig for the creation of a wellbore (hole) with the sole aim of the recovery of petroleum resources(oil and gas in this case). The drilling rig which is used to carry out this drilling operation is divided into 5 (five) systems they include: •	Hoisting system: This is the part of the drilling rig the helps increment in the wellbore depth they includes the hoisting tower structure i. e. the mast and derrick, the substructure, the draw works(hoist), the derrick line and its accessories and finally the travelling and crown block. •	Circulating system: This is the path in which mud and cuttings pass through during the drilling process so as to enhance a better rate of penetration (ROP) by suspension of cuttings ensuring that bit cuts a fresh surface while rotating, they include the stand pipe, Kelly hose, the drill stem, the annulus, the mud return line, the shale shaker, the mud pit. •	Rotary system: This system aids in the rotary action which aids drilling, ensuring a better rate of penetration (ROP), they include the swivel, Kelly, rotary drive and rotary table •	Power system: This system provides all the necessary power to carry out the drilling work; this is basically the Gen set and any other power generating equipment. •	Well control and monitoring system: this system basically helps to monitor the drilling operation, drilling a well is very dangerous, because the pressure in the reservoir could be significant high, which normally about couple thousands psi. The main part of this system is the blowout preventer(BOP) Drilling operation on the rig is carried out with the aid of drilling mud, the need for drilling mud in drilling operation cannot be over emphasized, and some of the uses of drilling mud include: •	Suspension/removal of cuttings from well, •	Control formation pressure, •	Seal permeable formations, •	Maintain wellbore stability, •	Minimize formation damage, •	Cool, lubricate, and support the <b>bit</b> and drilling <b>assembly,</b> •	Transmit hydraulic energy to tools and bit, •	Ensure adequate formation evaluation, •	Prevent inflow of formation fluid thereby preventing a kick, etc But the properties of drilling mud is dependent on the formation parameters, a drilling mud with a density of 8. 5 ppg despite being the API standard can’t be used to drill a formation of 10 ppg else caving in of the wellbore would occur thereby causing destruction of equipments, waste of time, and the need for a remedial operation such as sidetracking to be done which would require more funds for the operation, therefore the drilling mud used at any depth should be dependent of formation conditions at that depth. The properties of the drilling mud can be altered via the use of drilling mud additives, depending on the property needed to be increased. The mud weight/density can be increased to meet the well depth condition with the addition of weighter, example of a weighters include Haematite, Barite, etc these additives would help increase the mud weight to the needed weight, likewise, if the PH of our drilling mud needs to be increased in a case where by we are drilling through an acidic formation, additives which increase the ph of mud (PH Enhancers) can be used, examples of PH enhancers are potassium hydroxide(KOH), Sodium Hydroxide(NAOH), etc, there are also other parameters of drilling mud that can be altered such as viscosity, filtration, Gel strength etc...|$|R
