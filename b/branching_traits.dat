40|$|Graduation date: 1994 Noble fir (Abies procera Rehd.), an {{important}} conifer in the Pacific Northwest, is valuable for timber, Christmas trees, and greenery products. A number of tree improvement programs emphasizing genetic improvement of bole volume growth are underway in this species. The {{purpose of this}} study was to estimate genetic control of stem volume, stem form, and <b>branching</b> <b>traits</b> and the genetic interrelationships among these traits in sapling Noble fir eleven years old. Trees from sixty families growing on three progeny test sites in southwest Washington were utilized. Large family x site interactions were evident when all 3 sites were analyzed together, consequently sites were grouped into low (two sites) and high (one site) planting environments for genetic parameter estimation. Significant amounts of family variation were present in at east one environment for ten of the thirteen traits examined. Mean estimates of individual narrow-sense heritabilities were low to moderate for all traits: volume (. 22), height (. 31), stem diameter (. 21), taper (. 09), stem sinuosity (. 33), branch diameter ratio (. 15), branch length ratio (. 49), branch angle (. 23), branch number (. 10), and knot index (. 13). Family heritabilities for size traits were often twice as large as individual heritabilities. Genetic correlations were strong and positive among stem growth traits (>. 73), between branch length ratio and branch diameter ratio (. 75), and between sinuosity and stem growth traits (. 49 -. 54). With the exception of branch number, genetic correlations between branch traits and stem growth were weak or favorable, such that selection for stem volume should little or no negative impact on branching characteristics. Amounts of genetic and phenotypic variation present indicate moderate gains from selection and breeding programs are possible for stem growth, while lesser gains can be achieved for stem form and <b>branching</b> <b>traits...</b>|$|E
40|$|Estimates of {{individual}} heritability and genetic correlation are presented {{for a set}} of 10 growth and quality traits based on data from 16 Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) progeny trials in Finland. Seven of the traits (tree height, stem diameter, crown width, Pilodyn value, branch diameter, branch angle and branch number) were objectively measured, whereas three traits (stem straightness, branching score and overall score) were assessed visually. The genetic correlations were mostly moderate or low, and favorable from the tree breeder’s point of view. All variables related to tree size correlated relatively strongly and positively. Tree height exhibited a more favorable genetic relationship with the crown form traits than diameter, the latter showing positive correlation with branch diameter. Except for the slight negative correlation between branch angle and branch diameter, the <b>branching</b> <b>traits</b> were not notably correlated. The pilodyn value was positively correlated with stem diameter, reflecting negative correlation between diameter growth and wood density. The highest genetic correlations occurred among the two visually evaluated quality scores and branch diameter. All of the heritabilities were less than 0. 4. Overall score, Pilodyn, branch angle, branching score and tree height showed the highest heritability...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} for obtaining {{internal}} views of tree trunks was recently developed using X-ray computed tomography (CT). This technology {{makes it possible}} to observe and measure rameal traces that are left by latent buds, sequential branches, and epicormic branches in the wood. Epicormic branches are undesirable for producing high-value solid wood, especially in Quercus robur, an important hardwood forest tree species in Europe, which is prone to epicormic branches that develop from abundant latent buds. For the very first time, branching-related traits deduced from X-ray CT observation make it possible to analyze the genetic architecture of oak branching through a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis. Highly significant QTLs were detected for traits related to latent buds and epicormic branches. The number and effect of these QTLs suggest a moderate genetic determinism for the formation of latent buds and the development of epicormic branches. Three hotspots were found, grouping QTLs for different <b>branching</b> <b>traits.</b> An analysis of the common physiological denominators of these coincident traits suggests that their genetic controls are related to either the regulation of the axillary meristem initiation or to bud dormancy. Conversely, the position of only the separate QTL related to the number of sequential branches suggests an independent genetic control...|$|E

Association mapping was conducted for these traits of 39 lines and their 178 F 1 hybrids in three environments. There were 20 highly significant Quantitative Trait SSRs (QTSs) detected by mixed linear model approach analyzing a full genetic model with genetic effects of additive, dominance, epistasis and their environment interaction.

50|$|As stated above, {{the main}} <b>branching</b> <b>trait</b> for a {{language}} {{is just a}} tendency and it often shows exceptions. Spanish, for example, while overwhelmingly right-branching, puts numeral modifiers before nouns and, in certain cases, objects before verbs. Languages like English and German, though regarded as being right-branching because the main verbs precede direct objects, place adjectives and numerals before their nouns. Japanese and most other languages of northeastern Asia and the Indian subcontinent, on the other hand, are practically a model for rigidly left-branching languages. The Mon-Khmer and Austronesian languages of southeast Asia and many African languages come close to rigidly right-branching, with numerals as well as adjectives following their nouns and with degree words like very, too, extremely, and quite following the adjectives they modify.|$|R
40|$|Evolutionary {{branching}} is {{the process}} by which ecological interactions induce evolutionary diversification. In asexual populations with sufficiently rare mutations, evolutionary branching occurs through trait-substitution sequences caused by the sequential invasion of successful mutants. A necessary and sufficient condition for evolutionary <b>branching</b> of univariate <b>traits</b> is the existence of a convergence stable trait value at which selection is locally disruptive. Real populations, however, undergo simultaneous evolution in multiple traits. Here we extend conditions for evolutionary <b>branching</b> to bivariate <b>trait</b> spaces in which the response to disruptive selection on one trait can be suppressed by directional selection on another trait. To obtain analytical results, we study trait-substitution sequences formed by invasions that possess maximum likelihood. By deriving a sufficient condition for evolutionary <b>branching</b> of bivariate <b>traits</b> along such maximum-likelihood-invasion paths (MLIPs), we demonstrate the existence of a threshold ratio specifying how much disruptive selection in one trait direction is needed to overcome the obstruction of evolutionary branching caused by directional selection in the other trait direction. Generalizing this finding, we show that evolutionary <b>branching</b> of bivariate <b>traits</b> can occur along evolutionary-branching lines on which residual directional selection is sufficiently weak. We then present numerical analyses showing that our generalized condition for evolutionary branching is a good indicator of branching likelihood even when trait-substitution sequences do not follow MLIPs and when mutations are not rare. Finally, we extend the derived conditions for evolutionary <b>branching</b> to multivariate <b>trait</b> spaces...|$|R
40|$|Association mapping {{focused on}} 36 genes {{involved}} in branch development {{was used to}} identify candidate genes for variation in shoot branching in Arabidopsis thaliana. The associations between four <b>branching</b> <b>traits</b> and moderate-frequency haplogroups at the studied genes were tested in a panel of 96 accessions from a restricted geographic range in Central Europe. Using a mixed-model association-mapping method, we identified three loci—MORE AXILLARY GROWTH 2 (MAX 2), MORE AXILLARY GROWTH 3 (MAX 3), and SUPERSHOOT 1 (SPS 1) —that {{were significantly associated with}} branching variation. On the basis of a more extensive examination of the MAX 2 and MAX 3 genomic regions, we find that linkage disequilibrium in these regions decays within ∼ 10 kb and trait associations localize to the candidate genes in these regions. When the significant associations are compared to relevant quantitative trait loci (QTL) from previous Ler × Col and Cvi × Ler recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping studies, no additive QTL overlapping these candidate genes are observed, although epistatic QTL for branching, including one that spans the SPS 1, are found. These results suggest that epistasis is prevalent in determining branching variation in A. thaliana and may need to be considered in linkage disequilibrium mapping studies of genetically diverse accessions...|$|E
40|$|Oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) is an {{important}} agricultural crop that represents a major renewable resource for human food, animal feed and numerous non-food uses (e. g. bio-fuel, lubricants, high added-value products derived from green chemistry). Also cultivation of this crop is valuable for diversifying the cereal-dominated crop-rotations and for suppressing soil-borne pathogens. Therefore, many EU countries have {{a great interest in}} oilseed rape production. However, oilseed rape is characterized with higher nitrogen (N) balance surpluses than other crops, which increases the risk of environmental quality as well as the detriment of the economic return. A main approach is to reduce N fertilizer input and meanwhile to avoid severe yield penalties, which might be achieved by development and selection of oilseed rape cultivars that can efficiently use the available N. Studies on N efficiency have mainly highlighted the importance of the reproductive growth for a high yield under conditions of low N supply, and a minor importance of the vegetative growth, the processes decisive for reproductive growth should receive more attention in order to identify the decisive plant traits for N efficiency. Previous studies have revealed that reproductive development of oilseed rape can be influenced by various genetic and environmental factors. This thesis covers two possible aspects, i. e. genotypic variations in sulfur distribution and in <b>branching</b> <b>traits.</b> The main focuses are aiming at the influences of these genotypic variations on seed yield and N efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Two hybrid poplar {{maternal}} half-sib families, {{resulting from}} controlled crosses {{of the female}} parent Populus deltoides ‘S 9 - 2 ’ with P. nigra ‘Ghoy’ and P. trichocarpa ‘V 24 ’, were grown at three sites: northern Italy, central France and southern England. Juvenile stem growth traits (height, circumference and volume) and sylleptic branchiness (number of branches, density of branches per unit of stem height, percentage of the stem carrying branches and distance of the highest sylleptic branch {{to the top of}} the stem) were measured on 1 -year-old shoots. Our general objectives were to determine the degree to which the expression of stem growth and syllepsis and the relationships between them are affected by environmental conditions and to evaluate the efficiency of indirect selection for stem growth using <b>branching</b> <b>traits</b> as secondary criteria. The performance of both families differed significantly within and between sites. Pronounced heterosis was observed and highly significant genotype × environment interactions were found for all traits across the sites. Syllepsis showed more marked genetic variation and plasticity than stem growth traits. Relationships between sylleptic branchiness and stem growth depended on environmental conditions. Heritability values at the individual level ranged between 0. 09 and 0. 59, but genetic gain in stem volume was not significantly improved when selection was based on sylleptic branch characteristics. However, despite strong phenotypic plasticity among sites, genotypic ranking among the sites was relatively stable...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{widespread}} distribution of dwarf bamboo, Chimonobambusa utilis, in mountain environment, {{the effects of}} elevation (low and high) and canopy condition (forest understorey and forest edge) on the clonal morphology and leaf fluctuating asymmetry were investigated in an evergreen broadleaves forest of Jinfo Mountain Nature Reserve. Elevation and canopy condition were significant for all morphological traits of C. utilis (except for effect of elevation on node number under <b>branch).</b> <b>Traits</b> of clonal morphology such as height, basal diameter, height under branch tended to be higher in forest understorey and in high elevation. Forest understorey in high elevation was favour of shooting number. Interaction of elevation and canopy conditions {{had a significant effect}} on growth of node.

Intensive silvicultural practices, including fertilization, {{will be required to}} capture the full growth potential of clonal plantations. However, variation in nutrient use efficiency that exists among clones could affect growth responses. Our research objective was to determine the range of growth response and stem form quality due to fertilization in clones of Pinus taeda. A split-plot experimental design was used, with the whole plots being two levels of fertilizer application (fertilizer versus control) and the split plot factor being 25 clones. Whole plot treatments were blocked and replicated four times. Six years after planting and five years after fertilizer application, a repeated measures analysis showed fertilizer by-time and clone-by-time interactions affected volume (p 3 ̆c 0. 10). Clone-by-fertilizer interactions were observed for tree height, <b>branch</b> <b>traits,</b> and a metric of foliar display. These interactions were primarily due to scale-effect phenomena rather than rank shifts. The magnitude of fertilizer responses observed in a small number of genotypes suggests that knowledge of fertilizer responses in widely deployed genotypes, if developed prior to mid-rotation, may better optimize management of single-clone blocks. Our results further indicate that a range of possibilities exist for the design and application of clone-specific precision silvicultural systems...|$|R

Using a method presented in a recent paper, the defined <b>branching</b> <b>traits</b> were estimated in 140 different species, and the branching patterns of monocots (45 species) and dicots (95 species) were compared. It was checked that the method also applied to monocots (not considered in the previous paper), and that all traits could be estimated in each species. Variations of most traits were even larger for monocots than for dicots. Systematic differences appeared between these two groups: monocots tended to have a larger range in apical diameters (stronger heterorhizy), with both finer and thicker roots; the diameters of their lateral roots were also more variable; their roots exerted a stronger dominance over lateral branches. Altogether, species exhibited two main dependencies among their traits that were illustrated using two axes: (1) the ‘fineness–density’ axis separated the species which develop very fine roots and branch densely, from species without fine roots which space out their branches; and (2) the ‘dominance–heterorhizy’ axis separated the species according to the range in their apical diameter which was positively correlated {{to the level of}} dominance of mother roots over their branches. Both axes and correlations were remarkably similar for monocots and dicots. Conclusions Beyond the overall typology, this study went on to validate the phenotyping method in Natura, and showed its potential to characterize the differences in groups of species...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} relevant variables and appropriate stages in tree development to determine, as early as possible, genetic differences in growth and branching of apricot trees. Quantitative growth and <b>branching</b> <b>traits</b> of young trees were studied in four genotypes planted at three locations in the French growing area. Over the first three years of growth, the organisation of ten limbs was described for each genotype × location combination using 'AMAPmod' methodology. From the first year, the length, diameters, volume and sylleptic branching of limbs were influenced by genotype. In the second and third years, genetic variability was more clearly detected when cumulative variables, rather than annual variables, were considered on the cumulative components of limbs. At all three locations, the diameters, volume and number of long laterals were greatly affected, in particular, by genotype when the data were accumulated over the first 2 years. In addition, the abortion of short laterals developed on the first annual shoot was influenced by genotype. In contrast, from the second year, location clearly affected the length and number of growth units of limbs. As regards branching, location influenced the number of sylleptic shoots in the first year, then the number of long lateral shoots in the second year. Finally, the study showed that genetic differences in growth and branching need at least 3 years to be expressed on appropriate parts of the limbs and could be used to assess early breeding criteria for tree vigour and form...|$|E
40|$|An {{international}} {{study of}} provenance variation in Pinus caribaea Morelet and P. oocarpa Schiede in Central America and the Caribbean {{started in the}} early 1960 s. By the early 1970 s seed had been distributed to over fifty countries for many hundreds of trials. By the late 1970 s the most comprehensive of these had reached seven years, the optimum age for evaluation. A coordinated assessment programme was undertaken {{in a set of}} 29 trials in which 25 P. caribaea and 20 P. oocarpa provenances were represented. Four of the P. oocarpa sources were later recognized as P. patula Schiede andamp; Deppe ssp. tecunumanii (Equiluz andamp; Perry) Styles. Provenance representation was comprehensive for P. caribaea vars. hondurensis Barr. andamp; Golf. and caribaea, except for the omission of a few isolated populations; only one var. bahamensis Barr. andamp; Golf. provenance was included. Representation was satisfactory for P. oocarpa in Central America, but none of the populations in {{the central part of the}} range of P. patula ssp. tecunumanii in Honduras and Guatemala was sampled. New international trials of both P. caribaea var. bahamensis and P. patula ssp. tecunumanii are now in progress. Overall test site coverage was good except for P. caribaea vars. bahamensis and caribaea. Eighteen traits were assessed to describe productivity, stem quality, branching, reproduction, wood density and oleoresin composition. These are summarized in provenance-locality tables. Analysis of the data revealed statistically and operationally significant general differences between provenance regions for all three species as well as local differences between provenances within the regions. Five major groups emerged in P. caribaea, viz. var. caribaea, var. bahamensis, and inland, coastal and insular var. hondurensis. Each had productivity and silvicultural attributes that were in themselves of sufficient economic importance to influence choice for operational use in different sets of circumstances. Four provenance regions could be distinguished for P. oocarpa, the Mexican, North Guatemalan, South Guatemalan and Honduras-Nicaraguan. The Mexican type had poor productivity and undesirable silvicultural features but the differences between the other three were in traits that had little or no immediate operational significance. The four P. patula ssp. tecunumanii provenances separated on <b>branching</b> <b>traits</b> and resin composition into a group of the three Nicaraguan populations and the one from Belize. Although geno type environment interaction effects were not statistically estimated here, there were indications that they exist at the provenance region level for the three varieties of P. caribaea particularly where wind and biotic effects are significant factors in the environment. These trials have provided data that can be utilized not only to make immediate operation-al gains through provenance selection, but also to plan breeding strategies to enhance populations and to create synthetic varieties in a systematic genetic development for each species. </p...|$|E

We investigated seasonal fluctuations in soil water and salinity together with leaf and <b>branch</b> <b>traits</b> (area-based maximum assimilation (Amax), foliar nitrogen, specific leaf area (SLA) and Huber value (Hv)) and sap velocities of Eucalyptus macrorhyncha at four semi-arid sites in south-eastern Australia. Summer and winter soil salinities (10 cm depth) were 15 - 35 dS m⁻¹ and 8 - 10 dS m⁻¹ respectively. Gravimetric soil water {{content in the}} upper 20 cm was 2 - 5 % in summer and 7 - 23 % in winter, resulting in a significant inverse correlation between soil water and soil salinity. We found significant correlations between soil conditions and plant traits and function across seasons. Soil water content was significantly correlated with foliar N, SLA, Hv and maximum sap velocity while soil salinity was significantly correlated with Amax, Hv and maximum sap velocity. Correlations indicate co-variation of soil conditions and plant physiology in response to environmental conditions such as solar radiation and vapour pressure deficit (D).

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to describe how yield and quality of Pinus contorta vary with locality and provenance in Sweden. The differences between Pinus contorta and Pinus sylvestris are also described. The material comprises four trials in a provenance series assessed at an age of 24 years. Assessments were made of height, diameter, different <b>branch</b> <b>traits,</b> stem straightness, number of spike knots, basic density and fibre properties. A comparison was made of Pinus sylvestris with similar dimensions. Based on sectional measurements of felled trees, volume production was estimated for lodgepole pine. There were large differences in volume production, stem form and quality among the four trials. To achieve a high volume production, site and soil evaluation and treatment are important. There were large and significant differences among provenances for most traits evaluated. The best provenances were of a more southern origin at the southern trials, Remningstorp and Bogesund, when compared to the northern trial, Lövsåsen. In comparison with P. sylvestris at the same dimensions a correct P. contorta source has thinner branches and a lower number of branches while fibre length is increased.

40|$|Aim of study: We {{examined}} {{the impact of}} sustained partial throughfall exclusion on the functional performance of Buxus sempervirens L. in the understory of a Mediterranean evergreen forest. We further considered whether any impacts of throughfall exclusion were affected by light availability. Area of study: The {{study was conducted in}} the south of France. Material and methods: Several leaf physiological and <b>branch</b> structural <b>traits</b> were measured along a light gradient after seven years from the onset of a throughfall exclusion experiment (TEE). The results were analysed along with annual growth and survival data. Main results: Plant mortality was nil in both the throughfall exclusion and control treatments. Stem diameter growth was reduced by 39 % in plants subjected to throughfall exclusion, but this difference was only significant at the p = 0. 10 significance level. Leaf physiology remained unaffected by the TEE, but small changes were evident in <b>branch</b> structural <b>traits</b> in high light microsites following throughfall exclusion; branches had lower wood density in the TEE plot, and more biomass was partitioned to leaves relative to stems. Research highlights: These changes do not seem to reflect an acclimatory response that would enhance drought tolerance. Instead, we suggest that these drought effects might exacerbate vulnerability to xylem cavitation in the more open microsites. Reduced growth and increased vulnerability to drought may indicate an incipient decline in plant vitality following TEE. The extension of observations to the whole-plant level and longer periods will elucidate the consequences of these observations for plant fitness, and permit verification of the positive effect of shade on Buxus sempervirens under increased drought.

40|$|P. elliottii Engelm. var. elliottii is an {{important}} exotic plantation species in Zimbabwe, where it is grown for saw-timber and resin production. Three progeny tests, originating from factorial matings between parents selected in plantations, were assessed at five, eight and 15 years. The objectives {{of the study were}} to characterise quantitative genetic variation in the population through the estimation of genetic parameters, and to use these parameters in combined indices to select for specified breeding objectives for P. elliottii in Zimbabwe. All traits of interest were under a reasonable degree of additive genetic control, and the magnitudes of nonadditive genetic variances were almost invariably much less than those of additive genetic variances. Narrow-sense heritabilities for growth traits, wood density and resin yield were moderate to high, ranging from 0. 3 - 0. 42; those for stem straightness and <b>branching</b> <b>traits</b> were lower, ranging between 0. 10 and 0. 25. Genetic correlations at each of the assessment ages were more variable; of most consequence for this study were the slight negative correlations between wood density and both stem diameter and volume, and the slight positive correlation between density and height. Age-age correlations for growth traits were high, indicating potential for early selection. Age-age correlations for other traits ranged from moderately negative to highly positive. Although statistically significant for many traits, genotype-environment interaction was judged by a number of criteria to be of little practical importance. No one site was the most efficient for selection across the range of traits for establishment at other sites; rather, a set of pooled parameters was estimated for application on sites typical of those on which commercial plantations of P. elliottii are established. Selection indices were constructed for four breeding objectives, representing differing assumptions about the relative importance of saw-timber and resin production. Indices for both direct and indirect selection were compared in terms of genetic gain, efficiency and accuracy, which were influenced by the differential weighting of traits in the breeding objective. The highest gains, efficiency and accuracies were for the breeding objective of saw-timber only; increasing the emphasis on resin production reduced each of these parameters, and also had a more adverse impact on wood density. For a breeding objective corresponding to or emphasizing saw-timber production, selection based on diameter or height at five years was best; selection on the latter has the advantage of maintaining wood density at around its present level. Should resin production also be important, resin yield or a correlated trait must be included in the index. Efficiencies of indirect selection were highest at five years, regardless of the breeding objective or selection criteria considered. The lack of economic information was a considerable hinderance in conducting these analyses. The construction of more complete indices, incorporating information from all siblings represented in the factorial mating design, was also investigated for the breeding objective of saw-timber production. These indices were compared in terms of gain and accuracy, and their effect on population structure in the subsequent generation. Selection based on the most complete index resulted in the greatest gain and accuracy, but also in the greatest reduction in additive genetic variance in the next generation. These results highlight the dilemma facing breeders charged both with achieving gains in the short term and maintaining diversity over the longer term. Breeding strategies which facilitate differential intensities of selection and breeding, and the maintenance of a large effective population size, are seen as the best means to resolve these conflicting demands; some implications for the breeding population of P. elliottii in Zimbabwe are discussed. </p...|$|E

We examine how diversity dynamics and population performance|measured as the e ciency with which the population extracts energetic resources from its environment|depend on mutation rate and the presence or absence of selection. Systematic exploration of mutation rates reveals a bifurcation into qualitatively di erent classes of diversity dynamics, whether or not selection is present.

Class II: At intermediate mutation rates, diversity undergoes large random uctuations without always approaching any evident equilibrium value.

40|$|Poor shape {{stability}} of sawn softwood timber, causes substantial economic losses for sawmills {{and the building}} industry. Sawn timber twist is regarded {{to be the most}} severe deformation and {{has been shown to be}} controlled by intrinsic wood properties like wood shrinkage and spiral grain angle. The aim of the studies this thesis is based upon was to investigate the possibility to improve sawn timber shape stability, by genetic selection of genotypes of Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) with a favourable spiral grain angle. Genetic parameters were estimated for the spiral grain angle in the mature wood of trees in four progeny trials (age 27 – 36 years) and two clonal trials (age 19 years) of Norway spruce. In addition, in a 36 -year-old Scots pine progeny trial, the grain angle was measured and shape stability traits of the boards sawn from sampled trees were assessed. The estimates of genetic standard deviation (0. 7 °– 0. 9 °) and heritability (0. 29 – 0. 42) in the mature wood of both species suggested that grain angle could be altered by genetic selection. The grain angle measured in single annual rings of Scots pine showed substantial phenotypic correlations (0. 54 – 0. 70) with the twist of small sawn timber dried to a 12 % moisture content. As an example, twist could potentially be reduced by 0. 3 °– 0. 7 ° by selecting 20 % of the parents displaying the lowest grain angle, thereby appreciably decreasing the percentage of excessively twisted boards. Grain angle under bark exhibited non-significant genetic correlations, close to zero, with growth traits, stem form, and <b>branch</b> <b>traits</b> in both species, and with pilodyn penetration in Norway spruce, suggesting that genetic selection for this trait would not generate any appreciable response in the other traits. The results of the studies imply that the grain angle measured under bark is utilisable in terms of genetic parameter estimation and for predicting the twist propensity of small sawn timber. This suggests that there is potential to improve sawn timber shape stability by genetic selection for a lower grain angle under bark and thus reducing the twist of sawn timber...|$|R

This study evaluated stemflow efficiency {{for the first time}} with the combined results of SFP and FR, and sought to determine the inter- and intra-specific differences of stemflow yield and efficiency between the two species, as well as the specific bio-/abiotic mechanisms that affected stemflow. The results indicated that C.  korshinskii had a greater stemflow yield and efficiency at all precipitation levels than that of S.  psammophila. The largest inter-specific difference generally occurred at the 5 – 10  mm branches during rains of [*]≤[*]  2  mm. Precipitation amount was the most influential meteorological characteristic that affected stemflow yield and efficiency in these two endemic shrub species. Branch angle was the most influential plant trait on FR. For SF b, stem biomass and leaf biomass were the most influential plant traits for C.  korshinskii and S.  psammophila, respectively. For SFP of these two shrub species, leaf traits (the individual leaf area) and <b>branch</b> <b>traits</b> (<b>branch</b> size and biomass allocation pattern) had a great influence during lighter rains [*]≤[*]  10  mm and heavier rains [*]>[*]  15  mm, respectively. The lower precipitation threshold to start stemflow allowed C.  korshinskii (0. 9  mm vs.   2. 1  mm for S.  psammophila) to employ more rains to harvest water via stemflow. The beneficial leaf traits (e. g., leaf shape, arrangement, area, amount) might partly explain the greater stemflow production of C.  korshinskii. Comparison of SF b between the foliated and manually defoliated shrubs during the 2015  rainy season indicated that the newly exposed branch surface at the defoliated period and the resulting rainfall intercepting effects might be an important mechanism affecting stemflow in the dormant season...|$|R
30|$|Linking {{was carried}} out via Multi-Faceted Rasch Measurement (MFRM) (Linacre and Wright 1994). MFRM is based on Item Response Theory (IRT), a <b>branch</b> of Latent <b>Trait</b> Theory. The {{advantage}} of MFRM {{lies in the fact}} that all facets (i.e., items [descriptors in the current instance], persons [participating teachers in the current instance] and judge [the participants’ use of the rating scales]) can be compared on a common linear ‘logit’ scale (McNamara 1996). MFRM has been used to obtain information about severity and consistency of participants, the use of rating scales and items, as well as in studies investigating scales (North 2000).|$|R
40|$|Putative {{quantitative}} trait loci (QTL) of moderate, additive effect were identified for branch diameter, {{average number of}} branches per whorl per tree, average whorl spacing and regularity of whorl spacing in a single Pinus elliottii var. elliottii × P. caribaea var. hondurensis family. There {{was no evidence of}} additive × additive epistasis or pleiotropy. No marker-trait associations were detected for the average branch angle per whorl per tree. The detection of gene effects that were seemingly larger but less numerous than those expected for traits with low to moderate heritabilities was attributed to bias in the estimation of QTL magnitude and limited power to detect QTL due to a small sample size. <b>Branch</b> architecture <b>traits</b> exhibited considerable variation within the family with ranges of 4 – 6 standard deviations (SD) and tended to be less variable than height and diameter. Branching characters were largely independent of one another as well as growth, form and wood density properties. Branching characters other than branch angle were not influenced by macro-environmental factors...|$|R
40|$|Larch (Larix sp Mill.) is an {{important}} component in boreal montane and subalpine forests in the northern hemisphere. Macrofossils of larch in the Scandinavian mountains prove the existence of larch in Scandinavia after the last ice age, Siberian or Russian larch is now considered as an indigenous tree species of Sweden. The larches of Russia are of interest for their production potential and wood quality. The aim of this thesis was to determine frost resistance, juvenile growth, stem straightness and <b>branch</b> <b>traits</b> in a 5 -year-old combined provenance/progeny test with Larix sukaczewii, L. sibirica, L. gmelinii and L. cajanderi originating from Russia and tested on three sites in Sweden. An evaluation of genetic parameters in this half-sib family material was also made. The yield in 37 - 86 year old field tests of L. sukaczewii and Russian larch hybrids was also evaluated. The results indicate that larches from western Russia, L. sukaczewii were least damaged in the artificial freezing test, had highest survival in the field trials and had the best stem quality. The most northern provenances of this species had, however, poorer growth and lower survival, especially on the southern test site. L. sibirica from central Siberia and continental provenances of L. cajanderi and L. gmelinii were not adapted to any of the sites. Among provenances of L. gmelinii and L. cajanderi those with more maritime origin showed generally better adaptation than those from more continental areas. Geographic and climatic variables of provenance origin were important for the performance of the provenances. At the southern test site, provenances from northern latitudes and strongly continental areas in Russia showed poor growth and survival. On the two test sites located in harsh climates, provenances originating in climates similar to the test sites showed best survival. This means a northern transfer of 2 - 3 latitudes for the most northern site. The yield in 37 - 40 year-old L. sukaczewii was higher than Picea abies, Pinus sylvestris and Betula pendula on two test sites in central Sweden. In northern Sweden one provenance from Arkhangelsk showed higher yield after 50 years compared to one provenance from the central Ural Mountains. L. sukaczewii of Raivola origin demonstrated a wide ecological range with a yield of about 7 m 3 /ha/year for 76 years, in a local continental climate in central Sweden and a maritime site in northern Norway. Small test plots with the hybrid L. decidua x L. sukaczewii had substantially higher production than L. sukaczewii...|$|R
40|$|New {{techniques}} and approaches {{have been developed}} for root phenotyping recently; however, rapid and repeatable non-invasive root phenotyping remains challenging. Here, we present GrowScreen-PaGe, a non-invasive, high-throughput phenotyping system (4 plants min– 1) based on flat germination paper. GrowScreen-PaGe allows the acquisition of time series of the developing root systems of 500 plants, thereby enabling to quantify short-term variations in root system. The choice of germination paper was found to be crucial and paper[*]☓[*]root interaction should be considered when comparing data from different studies on germination paper. The system is suitable for phenotyping dicot and monocot plant species. The potential of the system for high-throughput phenotyping was shown by investigating phenotypic diversity of root traits in a collection of 180 rapeseed accessions and of 52 barley genotypes grown under control and nutrient-starved conditions. Most traits showed a large variation linked to both genotype and treatment. In general, root length traits contributed more than shape and <b>branching</b> related <b>traits</b> in separating the genotypes. Overall, results showed that GrowScreen-PaGe will be a powerful resource to investigate root systems and root plasticity of large sets of plants and to explore the molecular and genetic root traits of various species including for crop improvement programs...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{architecture}} is vital {{not only for}} crop yield, but also for field management, such as mechanical harvesting. The branch angle {{is one of the}} key factors determining plant architecture. With the aim of revealing the genetic control underlying branch angle in rapeseed (Brassica napus L.), the positional variation of branch angles on individual plants was evaluated, and the branch angle increased with the elevation of branch position. Furthermore, three middle branches of individual plants were selected to measure the branch angle because they exhibited the most representative phenotypic values. An association panel with 472 diverse accessions was estimated for <b>branch</b> angle <b>trait</b> in six environments and genotyped with a 60 K Brassica Infinium® SNP array. As a result of association mapping, 46 and 38 significantly-associated loci were detected using a mixed linear model (MLM) and a multi-locus random-SNP-effect mixed linear model (MRMLM), which explained up to 62. 2 and 66. 2 % of the cumulative phenotypic variation, respectively. Numerous highly-promising candidate genes were identified by annotating against Arabidopsis thaliana homologous, including some first found in rapeseed, such as TAC 1, SGR 1, SGR 3, and SGR 5. These findings reveal the genetic control underlying branch angle and provide insight into genetic improvements that are possible in the plant architecture of rapeseed...|$|R
40|$|Changes in the {{rapeseed}} branch angle alter plant architecture, allowing {{more efficient}} light capture as planting density increases. In this study, a natural population of rapeseed was grown in three environments and evaluated for <b>branch</b> angle <b>trait</b> to characterize their phenotypic patterns and genotype with a 60 K Brassica Infinium SNP array. Significant phenotypic variation was observed from 20 to 70 degrees. As a result, 25 significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with branch angle were identified on chromosomes A 2, A 3, A 7, C 3, C 5 and C 7 by the MLM model in TASSEL 4. 0. Orthologs of the functional candidate genes involved in branch angle were identified. Among the key QTL, the peak SNPs {{were close to}} the key orthologous genes BnaA. Lazy 1 and BnaC. Lazy 1 on A 3 and C 3 homologous genome blocks. With the exception of Lazy (LA) orthologous genes, SQUMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE 14 (SPL 14) and an auxin-responsive GRETCHEN HAGEN 3 (GH 3) genes from Arabidopsis thaliana were identified close to two clusters of SNPs on the A 7 and C 7 chromosomes. These findings on multiple novel loci and candidate genes of branch angle will be useful for further understanding and genetic improvement of plant architecture in rapeseed...|$|R
40|$|Aims: Evolutionary {{branching}} is {{a process}} of evolutionary diversification induced by frequency-dependent ecological interaction. Here we show how to predict the occurrence of evolutionary <b>branching</b> in bivariate <b>traits</b> when populations are evolving directionally. Methods: Following adaptive dynamics theory, we assume low mutation rates and small mutational step sizes. On this basis, we generalize conditions for evolutionary-branching points to conditions for evolutionary-branching lines and areas, which delineate regions of trait space in which evolutionary branching can be expected despite populations still evolving directionally along these lines and within these areas. To assess the quality of predictions provided by our new conditions for evolutionary branching lines and areas, we analyse three eco-evolutionary models with bivariate trait spaces, comparing the predicted evolutionary- branching lines and areas with actual occurrences of evolutionary branching in numerically calculated evolutionry dynamics. In the three examples, a phenotype's fitness is affected by frequency-dependent resource competition and/or predator-prey interaction. Conclusions: In the limit of infinitesimal mutational step sizes, evolutionary <b>branching</b> in bivariate <b>trait</b> spaces can occur only at evolutionary-branching points, i. e., where the evolving population experiences disruptive selection {{in the absence of any}} directional selection. In contrast, when mutational step sizes are finite, evolutionary branching can occur also along evolutioary-branching lines, i. e., where disruptive selection orthogonal to these lines is sufficiently strong relative to directional selection along them. Moreover, such evolutionary- branching lines are embedded in evolutionary-branching areas, which delineate all bivariate trait combinations for which evolutionary branching can occur when mutation rates are low, while mutational step sizes are finite. Our analyses show that evolutionary-branching lines and areas are good indicators of evolutionary branching in directionally evolving populations. We also demonstrate that not all evolutionary-branching lines and areas contain evolutionary- branching points, so evolutionary branching is possible even in trait spaces that contain no evolutionary-branching point at all...|$|R
40|$|The {{plausibility}} of {{sympatric speciation}} {{has long been}} debated among evolutionary ecologists. The process necessarily involves two key elements: the stable coexistence {{of at least two}} ecologically distinct types and the emergence of reproductive isolation. Recent theoretical studies within the theoretical framework of adaptive dynamics have shown how both these processes can be driven by natural selection. In the standard scenario, a population first evolves to an evolutionary branching point, next, disruptive selection promotes ecological diversification within the population, and, finally, the fitness disadvantage of intermediate types induces a selection pressure for assortative mating behaviour, which leads to reproductive isolation and full speciation. However, the full speciation process has been mostly studied through computer simulations and only analysed in part. Here I present a complete analysis of the whole speciation process by allowing for the simultaneous evolution of the <b>branching</b> ecological <b>trait</b> as well as a continuous trait controlling mating behaviour. I show how the joint evolution can be understood in terms of a gradient landscape, where the plausibility of different evolutionary paths can be evaluated graphically. I find sympatric speciation unlikely for scenarios with a continuous, unimodal, distribution of resources. Rather, ecological settings where the fitness inferiority of intermediate types is preserved during the ecological branching are more likely to provide opportunity for adaptive, sympatric speciation. Such scenarios include speciation due to predator avoidance or specialization on discrete resources...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The Green Revolution boosted {{crop yields}} in {{developing}} nations by introducing dwarf genotypes of wheat and rice capable of responding to fertilisation without lodging. We now need a second Green Revolution, to improve the yield of crops grown in infertile soils by farmers with little access to fertiliser, who represent the majority of third-world farmers. Just as the Green Revolution was based on crops responsive to high soil fertility, the second Green Revolution {{will be based on}} crops tolerant of low soil fertility. Substantial genetic variation in the productivity of crops in infertile soil has been known for over a century. In recent years we have developed {{a better understanding of the}} traits responsible for this variation. Root architecture is critically important by determining soil exploration and therefore nutrient acquisition. Architectural traits under genetic control include basal-root gravitropism, adventitious-root formation and lateral <b>branching.</b> Architectural <b>traits</b> that enhance topsoil foraging are important for acquisition of phosphorus from infertile soils. Genetic variation in the length and density of root hairs is important for the acquisition of immobile nutrients such as phosphorus and potassium. Genetic variation in root cortical aerenchyma formation and secondary development (‘root etiolation’) are important in reducing the metabolic costs of root growth and soil exploration. Genetic variation in rhizosphere modification through the efflux of protons, organic acids and enzymes is important for the mobilisation of nutrients such as phosphorus and transitionmetals, and the avoidance of aluminum toxicity. Manipulation of ion transporters may be useful for improving the acquisition of nitrate and for enhancing salt tolerance. With the noteworthy exceptions o...|$|R
40|$|Crown form is {{a visual}} {{characteristic}} having many component <b>traits</b> (<b>branch</b> thickness, branch angle, ramicorns, forks and uninodal/multinodal branch habit). Alternative methods of assessing each trait are evaluated {{in terms of}} their variance components and heritabilities in a progeny trial of Pinus radiata. A comparison is made between using one overall score for crown form and use of selection indices to combine traits. The efficiency of each alternative is compared in terms of the calculated selection response for each <b>trait.</b> For assessing <b>branch</b> diameter and branch angle a six point score was preferred to the use of a three or nine poInt score. The six point score resulted in large additive genetic variance and a higher heritability, giving good discrimination of genotypes without being confusing to the assessors. For ramicorns and forks, counting the actual numbers present resulted in higher heritabilities than scoring for their incidence. Calculated responses from selecting one tree in 100 on either a single crown form score or multitrait indices indicated that response in each component of crown form is greater for the indices...|$|R
40|$|Levin's fitness set {{approach}} has shaped the intuition of many evolutionary ecologists about resource specialization: if {{the set of}} possible phenotypes is convex, a generalist is favored, while {{either of the two}} specialists is predicted for concave phenotype sets. An important aspect of Levins approach is that it explicitly excludes frequency-dependent selection. Frequency-dependence emerged in a series of models that studied the degree of character displacement of two consumers coexisting on two resources. Surprisingly, the evolutionary dynamics of a single consumer type under frequency-dependence has not been studied in detail yet. We analyze a model of one evolving consumer feeding on two resources and show that, depending on the trait considered to be subject to evolutionary change, selection is either frequency-independent or frequency-dependent. This difference is explained by the effects different foraging traits have on the consumer-resource interactions. If selection is frequency-dependent, then the population can become dimorphic through evolutionary <b>branching</b> at the <b>trait</b> value of the generalist. Those traits with frequency-independent selection, however, do indeed follow the predictions based on Levin's fitness set approach. This dichotomy in the evolutionary dynamics of traits involved in the same foraging process was not previously recognized...|$|R
40|$|Shoot {{branching}} {{is a major}} {{determinant of}} plant architecture. Genetic variants for reduced stem branching in the axils of cauline leaves of Arabidopsis were found in some natural accessions and also at low frequency in the progeny of multiparent crosses. Detailed genetic analysis using segregating populations derived from backcrosses with the parental lines and bulked segregant analysis was used to identify the allelic variation controlling reduced stem <b>branching.</b> Eight quantitative <b>trait</b> loci (QTLs) contributing to natural variation for reduced stem branching were identified (REDUCED STEM BRANCHING 1 - 8 (RSB 1 - 8)). Genetic analysis showed that RSB 6 and RSB 7, corresponding to flowering time genes FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and FRIGIDA (FRI), epistatically regulate stem branching. Furthermore, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), which corresponds to RSB 8 as demonstrated by fine-mapping, transgenic complementation and expression analysis, caused pleiotropic effects not only on flowering time, but, in the specific background of active FRI and FLC alleles, also on the RSB trait. The consequence of allelic variation only expressed in late-flowering genotypes revealed novel and thus far unsuspected roles of several genes well characterized for their roles in flowering time contro...|$|R
