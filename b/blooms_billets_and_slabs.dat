25|$|Semi-finished casting {{products}} are intermediate castings produced in a foundry that need further processing before being a finished good. There are four types: ingots, <b>blooms,</b> <b>billets,</b> <b>and</b> <b>slabs.</b>|$|E
40|$|In most {{integrated}} works, ingots {{are used}} as an intermediate form during the production of steel. These ingots, produced by pouring molten steel into molds, are too large {{to be used as}} input for the finishing mills which produce steel products. Hence, more manageable forms (<b>blooms,</b> <b>billets</b> <b>and</b> <b>slabs)</b> are rolled from the ingots by primary mills. The necessity of having uniformly hot steel, provided by a battery of soaking pits, limits the production capacity of any primary mill. At times there is no hot steel and the mill comes into "nothing hot" delays. It is desirable to reduce these delays to a minimum through proper management of the system. One way of doing so is to properly control the charging into the soaking pits of ingots from the queue which builds up there. The paper investigates the properties of this problem which can be considered in two parts. Firstly, when there are ingots of various temperatures in the queue, which should be charged when space becomes available in the pits? Secondly, if space becomes available when there are no hot ingots in the queue, should the empty pit be kept idle waiting for more to arrive or should it be charged with cold ingots which though readily available require considerably longer to prepare for rolling? There is the possibility of inserted idle time. A model is made of the ingot queue-soaking pit-rolling mill system. The properties of the optimal control policy for the ingot queue are investigated using Markov programming. Results are presented which illustrate its complex state dependent nature. ...|$|E

50|$|Steel was {{produced}} at the works using basic electric arc and open hearth methods. Principal products included alloy and carbon steel bars (case hardening, bright drawing, free cutting, machining, {{hot and cold}} forging), special sections, railway bearing plates, rounds, squares, flats, angles, channels, joists, <b>billets,</b> <b>blooms,</b> <b>slabs</b> <b>and</b> large forging ingots. Round Oak manufactured a weldable extra high-strength steel under the brand name, 'Thirty-Oak'.|$|R
40|$|Continuous casting is used {{to solidify}} most of the steel {{produced}} in the world every year. The process reduces the number of required milling stages and results in qualitative semi-finished products such as <b>billets,</b> <b>blooms</b> <b>and</b> <b>slabs</b> which will later be rolled into more specific shapes. Extending the range of finished product sizes produced from a given concast <b>bloom</b> or <b>billet</b> section is often limited by the minimum area reduction required to ensure effective consolidation and final mechanical properties. Predicting effective consolidation or level of remnant porosity {{has always been an}} important issue for steel producers as it will affect the mechanical properties of final products (strength, ductility, etc.). It is known that partial or complete recovery of strength in such porous materials can be obtained by pore closure and diffusive healing processes at elevated temperature. Devising an appropriate healing process which does not cause discontinuity in the microstructure and mechanical properties at the healing sites and prevents distortion of the component during bonding requires an accurate choice of thermo-mechanical processing parameters. Although there has been considerable work on materials such as titanium alloys, aluminium alloys and copper, damage healing in free cutting steel has not received much attention. The main aim of this research is to develop a realistic damage healing computational approach that can predict damage healing or recovery during soaking under different compressive stress levels, and be used for hot rolling applications. This study investigates the void elimination process through two stages of void closure and healing. An Abaqus/UMAT subroutine has been developed for the analysis of the material porosity elimination process including two stages of void closure and healing. This study uses the Gurson-Tvergaard model under hydrostatic compression to predict the void closure. A novel approach has been developed in the present work to identify the Gurson-Tvergaard model parameters using a non-gradient based optimisation search method (Pattern Search Method). The healing process is modelled based on a combination of diffusion bonding, creep and plasticity following the Pilling model and can be adapted to any other healing/diffusion bonding model. The material model has been calibrated for free cutting steel and a stress state representative of the rolling process, and used to predict the closure and healing processes under rolling. The effect of parameters such as Roll Gap shape Factor (RGF), initial amount and distribution of void volume fraction on porosity elimination during rolling has also been investigated. An experimental technique has been developed to identify the conditions (temperature, pressure, time) required for void elimination in Free Cutting Steel (FCS). Different combinations of load and time were tested and optimum conditions have been obtained. Tensile tests on the bonded specimens have been carried out to measure the strength of the bonded region. The position of fracture on the specimen and also the cross section of the fracture surface have been inspected. The experimental results have been used to calibrate the developed void elimination model. Using the developed model, predictions of densification and healing can be made for optimisation of the rolling schedule. Open Acces...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Today, in the {{industry}} of aluminum, the D. C. casting of <b>billets</b> <b>and</b> <b>slabs</b> is playing the major role. The producers of these <b>slabs</b> <b>and</b> <b>billets</b> are many. The end users of the product are OEMs. The degassing technology for producing these aluminum <b>slabs</b> <b>and</b> <b>billets</b> is provided by very few. There {{are two types of}} degassing methods currently in use. One of these, vacuum degassing, is used primarily in the steel industry and thus not generally used in the aluminum industry. The second method, generally employed in the aluminum industry, is rotary degassing, which uses finely dispersed argon, chlorine, fluorine to remove dissolved hydrogen and various salts from melt. The challenges associated with producing aluminum are reducing porosity due to hydrogen precipitation during casting through degassing processes; which generates detrimental effects on mechanical properties of alloy castings and removing impurities like; the Ca, Mg salts etc. from the molten metal. Looking at the degassing systems provided by these players, are going to be obsolete as the environment norms will become stricter in the next decade, because of the use of Fluorine and Chlorine for removing the Ca, Mg, etc. impurities from the molten metal as the ozone layer is getting depleted and process becomes more cumbersome and hazardous. So, the innovation in the technology is needed; which leads research interest on development of the ultrasonic degassing as a better option. During this research authors would be using ultrasonic technology over existing technology to compare the results of conventional degasser units available in the market such as LARS TM, SNI...|$|R

40|$|Effect of {{electro-magnetic}} stirring on {{soundness of}} continuously cast <b>billets</b> <b>and</b> <b>slabs</b> {{can be assessed}} by many methods like visual inspection of macro-etch & sulphur print evaluation. Ultrasonic assessment provides through thickness information of the test samples, whereas, macro-etching and sulphur print methods provide information in one plane only. An attempt {{has been made to}} evaluate the soundness (inhomogeneities / flaws as well as effect of columnar / equiaxed grains) of continuously cast low carbon and high carbon continuously cast billets by ultrasonic attenuation as well as high gain pulse-echo technique in transverse cut slices. One low carbon grade (Grade – LC) and one high carbon grades (Grade – HC) were selected for this purpose. Assessment of over all flaws / inhomogeneities was done by counting number of high gain internally reflected signals (flaw-echoes) using 6 MHz twin crystal probe. Using 10 MHz probe and attenuation technique (attenuation indicated by back-wall echo drop) was used to evaluate the overall macro-structure (including columnar / equiaxed grains as well as inhomogeneities / flaws). The result revealed no significant improvement in the equiaxed zone in case of low carbon grade billets (i. e. Grade – LC), whereas, there was significant improvement in the equiaxed zone of high carbon grade billets (Grade – HC). The ultrasonic flaws in the inclusion concentration bands in all the billets were found to decrease after electro-magnetic stirring.

40|$|Abstract This thesis {{studies the}} factors that govern {{transverse}} cracking during continuous casting of low carbon, niobium microalloyed and boron microalloyed steels. Crack susceptibility in the thick <b>slab,</b> <b>billet</b> <b>and</b> thin <b>slab</b> casting processes are compared by using typical conditions in laboratory hot ductility tests. There is limited published literature on hot ductility in aluminium-killed and siliconkilled boron microalloyed steels and the proposed mechanisms of failure by transverse cracking are contradictory. Few published papers specifically compare hot ductility behaviour of any steels between thick <b>slab,</b> <b>billet</b> <b>and</b> thin <b>slab</b> continuous casting processes. Thus, {{the basis of this}} research is to assess the influence of casting parameters and compositional variations on hot ductility behaviour in low carbon steels, niobium microalloyed steels, aluminium-killed boron microalloyed steels and silicon-killed, boron microalloyed steels. The typical temperature ranges, cooling rate and strain rate conditions of the continuous casting processes were used in reheated and in situ melted hot tensile tests performed on steel specimens. Solidification, transformation and precipitation temperatures were calculated using solubility equations and modelled using the Thermo-CalcTM thermodynamics program. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy were used to determine the modes of failure in the tested specimens. In the low carbon steels, hot ductility was improved by increasing the strain rate; by calcium treatment, which minimises copper sulphide and iron sulphide formation; and by maintaining a nickel to copper ratio of 1 : 1. It was shown that thin slab casting conditions provided the best hot ductility results for the low carbon steels. All the niobium steels showed poor ductility in the single-phase austenite temperature region, indicating that intergranular precipitation of fine niobium carbonitrides was the cause of the poor ductility. It was shown that the hot ductility was greatly improved by calcium treatment, by decreasing the cooling rate and by increasing the strain rate. Slow iv thin <b>slab</b> <b>and</b> thick <b>slab</b> casting conditions provided the best hot ductility results for the niobium steels. Hot ductility was substantially improved in the aluminium-killed boron steels by increasing the boron to nitrogen ratio from 0. 19 to 0. 75. The results showed that, at cooling rates generally associated with thick <b>slab,</b> bloom <b>and</b> slow thin <b>slab</b> casting, a boron to nitrogen ratio of ≥ 0. 47 was sufficient to avoid a ductility trough altogether. However, under conditions typically experienced in fast thin <b>slab</b> <b>and</b> <b>billet</b> casting, a boron to nitrogen ratio of 0. 75 was required to provide good hot ductility. The mechanism of the ductility improvement with increasing boron to nitrogen ratio was found to be enhanced precipitation of boron nitride, leading to a decrease in nitrogen available for aluminium nitride precipitation. In the silicon-killed boron steels, {{it was found that the}} boron to nitrogen ratio had the overriding influence on hot ductility and hence on crack susceptibility. Excellent hot ductility was found for boron to nitrogen ratios above 1. Additionally, analysis of industrial casting data showed that the scrap percentage due to transverse cracking increased significantly at manganese to sulphur ratios below fourteen. An exponential decay relationship between the manganese to sulphur ratio and the average scrap percentage due to transverse cracking was determined as a tool to predict scrap levels in the casting plant...|$|R
50|$|Hot rolling is a {{metalworking}} {{process that}} occurs above the recrystallization {{temperature of the}} material. After the grains deform during processing, they recrystallize, which maintains an equiaxed microstructure and prevents the metal from work hardening. The starting material is usually large pieces of metal, like semi-finished casting products, such as <b>slabs,</b> <b>blooms,</b> <b>and</b> <b>billets.</b> If these products came from a continuous casting operation the products are usually fed directly into the rolling mills at the proper temperature. In smaller operations the material starts at room temperature and must be heated. This is done in a gas- or oil-fired soaking pit for larger workpieces and for smaller workpieces induction heating is used. As the material is worked the temperature must be monitored {{to make sure it}} remains above the recrystallization temperature. To maintain a safety factor a finishing temperature is defined above the recrystallization temperature; this is usually 50 to 100 °C (90 to 180 °F) above the recrystallization temperature. If the temperature does drop below this temperature the material must be re-heated before more hot rolling.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{continuous}} {{steel casting}} (CSC) {{technology is a}} dynamically developing method for obtaining steel semi-finished product {{in the form of}} a continuous casting <b>slabs,</b> <b>blooms</b> <b>and</b> <b>billets.</b> During the course of the CSC process, the liquid form of steel offers a possibility of introducing alloy additions to adjust the chemical composition or modify the non-metallic inclusions. The aim of the tests was to verify the degree of chemical homogenization of the steel after the addition of nickel. Design/methodology/approach: The device under examination is a wedge-shaped single-nozzle tundish of a capacity of 30 Mg. Computer simulation of the liquid steel flow and alloy addition behaviour in turbulent motion conditions was done using the Ansys-Fluent® computer program. Due to the complexity of alloy addition dissolution and dispersion in metallurgical processes, a decision was made to use the Species Model available within the Ansys-Fluent® program. Findings: The computer simulation produced a picture of the flow of liquid steel and the spread of nickel within the liquid steel volume. To illustrate the chemical homogenization process spatially and in a greater detail, the Ni diffusion process was monitored at selected measurement points situated in the tundish working space region. Research limitations/implications: Numerical model not include melting process of alloy addition. Practical implications: The results from numerical simulation could be use to elaborate a method of controlled alloy addition feeding to the liquid steel during continuous steel casting process.
